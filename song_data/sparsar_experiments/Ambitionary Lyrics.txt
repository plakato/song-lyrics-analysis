Ambitionary Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

How much further must I go before.
I can't escape my past?
Oh.
I wish I could have lived, without regrets.
But I made, my mistakes so many times.

Where do you go when the darkness finds you?
All I want is to see better days.
And have my past washed away.
All I want is better days.

But where do I go? But where do I go?
I need a place to call my own.
Where we can we find hope? Where can we find hope?
I need you to show me the road.

Life shouldn't be this hard, not a reminder of.
Of how much you've failed.
Remind yourself you've come this far, you've come so far.
Remind yourself you've come this far, you've come so far.

But where do I go? But where do I go?
I need a place to call my own.
Where can we find hope? Where can we find hope?
I need you to show me the road.

But where do I go? But where do I go?
I need a place to call my own.
Where can we find hope? Where can we find hope?
I need you to show me the road.

Why wasted this for me?
Show me where to go.
Show me anything, give me everything.
Show me where to go.
Show me anything, give me everything.

I keep waiting more and more.
But I can't see, Can't start alone.

But where do I go? But where do I go?

But where do I go? But where do I go?
I need a place to call my own.
Where can we find hope? Where can we find hope?
I need you to show me the road.

But where do I go? But where do I go?
I need a place to call my own.
Where can we find hope? Where can we find hope?
I need you to show me the road.

Wanted you to show me the road.
