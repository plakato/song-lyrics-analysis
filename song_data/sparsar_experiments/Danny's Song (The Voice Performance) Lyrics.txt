Danny's Song (The Voice Performance) Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one.
And we've just begun.
Think I'm gonna have a son.
He will be like she and me, free as a dove.
Conceived in love.
The sun is gonna shine above.

And even though we ain't got money.
I'm so in love with you honey.
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise.
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes.
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi.
Never got high.
And oh I was a sorry guy.
And now I smile and face a girl that shares my name.
Now I'm through with the game.
This boy will never be the same.

And even though we ain't got money.
I'm so in love with you honey.
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise.
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes.
And tell me everything, is gonna be alright.

Love a girl who holds the world in a paper cup.
And drink it up.
Love her and she'll bring you luck.
And if you find she helps your mind, buddy take her home.
Oh don't you live alone.
Try to earn what lovers own.

And even though we ain't got money.
I'm so in love with you honey.
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise.
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes.
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Even though we ain't got money.
I'm so in love with you, honey.
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise.
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes.
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.
