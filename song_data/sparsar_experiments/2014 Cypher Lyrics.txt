2014 Cypher Lyrics
by Zoltan Nebula.

Stop collaborate and listen, 
I'll, let you know what most of you have been missing: 
See, I'm Vanilla, Spice, I'm a little nice 
Yeah right about half as nice as pubic lice 
I spit shit like a mother, fucking polar bear, 
I'll help your girl, I'll even fucking, hold Her hair 
While she's puking all over the bathroom 
It's okay girl got ta, get rid of that Pabst Blue 
Take, her out for fast food. Oh it's time to mack. Soon, 
 Gon na make her ass. Look like a fucking, baboons 
I'm, a fucking, mad dude. Don'T believe in taboo 
Even if her panties look like a plate of Ragu 
Call me Fred, Flintstone, yelling, yabadabadoo 
Cause, my cashews are in her hair like shampoo, 
Ohhhh, ..., I'm so nasty and grimy 
You know. I always got bad bitches behind me. ... 
Licking, my ass. While I'm licking my stash starting to laugh 
Cause, I'm passing gas, while this damn bitch is licking my ass 
I'm pissed off like a lonely, horny T-Rex, 
Unimpressed stressed and desperate for sex 
Home alone, and I drop my own soap in the shower 
I'd, be down to Fuck, the pink ranger of power 
I haven't been on my game in quite some time, 
That's why I'm spitting these right, dumb, rhymes 
Open, my cloak to those who get choked at these jokes 
Get separated like yolk or choke on a rope 
Will people get offended by This, I know a few will 
But. If I can't make you laugh or smile, maybe my pubes will
