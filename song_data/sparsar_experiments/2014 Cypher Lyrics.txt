2014 Cypher Lyrics
by Zoltan Nebula.

Stop, collaborate and listen.
I'll let you know what most of you have been missing.
See I'm Vanilla Spice, I'm a little nice.
Yeah right, about half as nice as pubic lice.
I spit shit like a mother fucking polar bear.
I'll help your girl, I'll even fucking hold her hair.
While she's puking all over the bathroom.
It's okay girl, gotta get rid of that Pabst Blue.
Take her out for fast food, oh it's time to mack soon.
Gonna make her ass look like a fucking baboons.
I'm a fucking mad dude, don't believe in taboo.
Even if her panties look like a plate of Ragu.
Call me Fred Flintstone, yelling yabadabadoo!!
Cause my cashews are in her hair like shampoo.
Ohhhh... I'm so nasty and grimy.
You know I always got bad bitches behind me....
Licking my ass while I'm licking my stash, starting to laugh.
Cause I'm passing gas while this damn bitch is licking my ass.
I'm pissed off like a lonely horny T-Rex.
Unimpressed, stressed and desperate for sex.
Home alone and I drop my own soap in the shower.
I'd be down to fuck the pink ranger of power.
I haven't been on my game in quite some time.
That's why I'm spitting these right dumb rhymes.
Open my cloak to those who get choked at these jokes.
Get separated like yolk or choke on a rope.
Will people get offended by this?? I know a few will.
But if I can't make you laugh or smile maybe my pubes will.
