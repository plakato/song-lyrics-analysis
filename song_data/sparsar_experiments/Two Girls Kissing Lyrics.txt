Two Girls Kissing Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Days like this.
May or might not count for much.
But as such.
I lost my way then found it.
Where i least expected.
Could've melted.

Two girls kissing.
Confiding in love.
When i least expected.
Sentiment.

I can't go it's real hard.
Sometimes i feel confused.
And all my expectations down.
And all my fears they start to slip away.

Days like this.
May or might not count for much.
But as such.
Lost my way then found it.
When i least expected.
