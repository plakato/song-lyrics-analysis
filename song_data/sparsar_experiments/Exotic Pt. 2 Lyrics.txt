Exotic Pt. 2 Lyrics
by Yung Berg.

Yb:yeah,so,i just gotta describe,u know what im sayin,a few things,a few ways.

I ain't never really nobody like you before.
I must say___yo ray go tell em whats good yo.
Ray j:ya took me swimmin,in the ocean and we flyin.
Coast to coast and ya always keep me focused yeaheyeah.
On a island,jet skiin',me and u girl.
For the weekend,by da weekend,puerto rican yeaheyeah.
Yb:ay im headed uptown to harlem to pick my mami up.
I know da pussy tight,she ain't tryina give it up.
She my pretty,young thing.
I fly south to see her.
Body like jlo face like selina.
Saturday morn' reggaton out the speakers.
Shawty you's a ten,i dont neva wanna leave ya.
She knows that imma playa but when i get a chance.
Imma put her ina bed,shit,n j holday her.
Im all about paper,but ma it ain't a party if i.
Can't have you.
Even clyde needed bonnie.
I need ya right here babygirl to ride shotty.
Im fuckin wit ya mami,hard body,ya know.
Ray j:ya took me swimmin,in the ocean and we flyin.
Coast to coast and ya always keep me focused yeaheyeah.
On a island,jet skiin',me and u girl.
For the weekend,by da weekend,puerto rican yeaheyeah.
Yb:im headed downtown,chicago to pick ma shawty up.
She__wit her__swear she dont giva fuck.
Roll up,hit the pip till she cough her lungs up.

But baby she a freak,she taught me da tummy tuck.
Girl:what is that?
Yb:its when i lay a pillow down,on her stomach flat.
Hand full of hair,just the arch of her back.
Then i go deep in it,so deep in it that i fall.
Asleep in it.
Ay,betta hope that shit dont leak in it,shell.
Try tuh keep it in less than 3 minutes.
And baby,she a pimp,she dealin wit three niggas.
But i still love her,we do it like no other.
Ray j:ya took me swimmin,in the ocean and we flyin.
Coast to coast and ya always keep me focused yeaheyeah.
On a island,jet skiin',me and u girl.
For the weekend,by da weekend,puerto rican yeaheyeah.
I make a stop in spanish harlem,pick ma girl up.
I bought a red rose it matched my red tux.
Take her to a island,make her feel special.
Hop up on a jet,take ya to a place ya ain't never.
Been yet.
Fiji is the island,thats where we'll get wet.
Had me swimmin in the ocean,flyin coast to coast.
Always keep me focused.
Yeaheyeah.
fades out.
