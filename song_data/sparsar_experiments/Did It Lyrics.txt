Did It Lyrics
by Two-9.


Man, I came in just to get my partnas poppin'.
Got my diamonds jumpin' like they hoppin' scotchin'.
I mean strip I'm tipping for a lotta lobster.
I been doing this shit for a lot of drummas.
And my whole crew is worth like a lot of commas.
Keep the peace just like Dali Llama.
And I'm probably fuckin' on your daughter's mama.
Blunt is louder than a fuckin' concert.
I mean, ye your honor, ye your honor.
I will never ever tell nobody.
Beverly Willsha I run round the lobby.
Stack a ferrari mike told me he got me.
Excuse if I'm cocky, I prove it like ya know.
Get money Nike, just do it like Ye' now.
Zone 6, bricks, free Gucci in this bitch.
Know I'm always with the shits.
Said its eastside, A-town.
I don't gotta tell 'em cause they know nigga.
Did it for the set so I don't owe niggas.
Ya'll still nickel and dimin' that dope nigga.
I just made a couple thou' off a show nigga.
Probably somewhere out witcho' ho, nigga.
I will never go out as a broke nigga.
Fuck a TV, I show, nigga.

Did it, did it did it, I did it.
Did it, mmm-mmm did it, said I did it, did it.
So fuck them ? can't say I didn't.
I did it, I said I did it, can't say I didn't.
I did it, I said I did it, can't say I didn't.
I did it, I said I did it, can't say I didn't.
I did it, I fucking did it, said I did it.
I did it, can't say I didn't, can't say I didn't.
Said I.

Came in just to get my partnas poppin'.
Back then I was broke, but now I'm guapin'.
She ain't want me back when I was on the bottom.
Now I'm up at the top and she won't stop toppin'.
Stay on yo' level, can't sit at the top.
Stack some bread with the cream , that's my only toppin'.
That's first toast if you boast, we goin' get it poppin'.
Pocket rocket, ain't no Tamagotchi.
My shirt and my jacket by Takahashi.
Denim I will never tell nobody.
That's Undercover kicks from London.
probably.
And the money counter sound just like a tommy.
And excuse If I'm cocky, the car cost a cribbo.
With yo' girl it's date night, like Late Night with Leno.
Zone 6, bricks, free Gucci in this bitch.
Know I'm always with the shits.
Said its eastside, they know.
I ain't gotta tell 'em cause they know boy.
I ain't never claim to be no dough boy.
I just hit the yo and kill the dope boy.
Say you gettin' money, you a no Floyd.
5 years later, what the hell you got to show for it?
Did a deal with Iovine and our own tour.
I ain't gotta tell 'em cause they know boy.
I ain't gotta tell 'em cause they know.

Did, did it, did it did it, I did it.
Did it, mmm-mmm did it, said I did it, did it.
So fuck them ? can't say I didn't.
I did it, I said I did it, can't say I didn't.
I did it, I said I did it, can't say I didn't.
I did it, I said I did it, can't say I didn't.
I did it, I fucking did it, said I did it.
I did it, can't say I didn't, can't say I didn't.
Said I.

Said I.

Did it, did it did it, I did it.
Did it, mmm-mmm did it, said I did it, did it.
So fuck them ? can't say I didn't.
I did it, I said I did it, can't say I didn't.
I did it.
