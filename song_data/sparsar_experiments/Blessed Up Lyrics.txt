Blessed Up Lyrics
by ViZion.


Yea, yo, huh.
It's a crazy world.
You know what I mean?
But it's all good though, yea.

I'm blessed up, blessed up.
Everyday when I wake up.
Take a moment, send praise up.
Better days are on the way up.
And we're blessed up, blessed up.
So we can't get stressed up.
Even when life's messed up.
Keep walking with our heads up.

Trying to make it, trying make it.
Had pipe dreams in the barrel I'd make it.
Of shining like a high beam, the basis.
Of living no limitations as I chase it.
May I never live my life basic.
Hit the road running like an Asics.
Keeping it together like laces.
Hard works, coming 'round like a bracelet so I.
Hustle in the struggle, everyday and there's no giving up.
Looking in the mirror now I see that I am big enough.
ViZions getting clearer, like a diamond in the rough.
Thank God, I've been show love.
Thank God, I'm past the worst.
As I elevate through the pain and the hurt.
Yea I let em hate, 'til they put me in a hearse.
Through better and worse, no man can curse cause I know.

I'm blessed up, blessed up.
Everyday when I wake up.
Take a moment, send praise up.
Better days are on the way up.
And we're blessed up, blessed up.
So we can't get stressed up.
Even when life's messed up.
Keep walking with our heads up.

And I don't know, what they want from me.
Some just don't wanna see me succeed.
Yea I hold my tongue, keep my peace.
But I do get cross, like a Jesus piece.
So I eat these beats.
And I know these streets.
Make people get mean, wanna scream, lose sleep.
Every time I'm in the truck it's on mo'fucking E.
And I hate this shit, can't take this shit.
Trying to get away and make a change in this bitch.
Up all in the night, like a spaceship is.
And friends wanna know what the basis is.
Why I don't see 'em anymore.
Never showing up at the door.
Never would I diss, that's sure.
We're friends for life but I don't wanna be poor.
And I couldn't do it on my own.
Remember when Dad left home.
And mum was left all alone.
I was trying'a cope, blowing more weed smoke, skipping school.
Remember when the cops came through.
Should'a blamed me, blamed you.
Law called I wasn't even home.
Swear I never felt that low, but I know.

I'm blessed up, blessed up.
Everyday when I wake up.
Take a moment, send praise up.
Better days are on the way up.
And we're blessed up, blessed up.
So we can't get stressed up.
Even when life's messed up.
Keep walking with our heads up.

Dream chasing on the go.
Even when I'm down I'm coming off the ropes.
Shining, chasing the glow.
In the concrete coming up like a Makaveli rose.
Hating on me and it shows.
Preeing on my jewelry and all the fine clothes.
I'm above like a halo.
Plus I'm going up so I let 'em stay low.
And I keep it popping, and glowing and roller coasting.
The motion, I'm living life in the moment.
I Instagram it and hold it.
And now I got it decoded, I see these doors that I opened.
And all the time I devoted, I recognize that I wrote it.
I set my eyes onto progress and I drove it like it was stolen.
And put my money up with the dice rolling.
Now I'm picking up the proceeds with both hands cause I'm.

I'm blessed up, blessed up.
Everyday when I wake up.
Take a moment, send praise up.
Better days are on the way up.
And we're blessed up, blessed up.
So we can't get stressed up.
Even when life's messed up.
Keep walking with our heads up.

Yea, yea we gotta keep walking with our heads up.
For real, you know what I mean?
They say after every dark day, or every storm.
Comes a bright light so, ya know, just keep pushing on.
Stay strongâ€¦ViZion.
