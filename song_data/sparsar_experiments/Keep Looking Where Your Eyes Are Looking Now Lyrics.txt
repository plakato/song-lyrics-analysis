Keep Looking Where Your Eyes Are Looking Now Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Six of us pack in the car and stare out at the stars.
Wondering if you're up there.
When I heard the news I went numb.
At first in denial but somehow, I knew.

Don't look down.
Set yourself up for falling.
Don't look back; the past is never good enough.
Don't look up, you won't find answers in the clouds.
Keep looking where your eyes are looking now.
