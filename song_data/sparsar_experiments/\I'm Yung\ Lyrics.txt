\I'm Yung\ Lyrics
by Yung Tre.

Yung Tre, Yung Tre, I'm Yung.
I'm yung I have money in my pocket, enough to fly off, in a rocket. I'm yung I still go outside and get money,.
thats why these bitches be actin' kinda funny. I'm yung well that may not be the word. I beg your pardon other rappers are absurd thats why.
some niggas clown me and they get what they deserve getting' death threats if.
they even dare to call me nerd. Cuz.
I'm a rapper, a hip-hop artist I go deep like my nigga Benjarvus, Green-Ellis.
. These niggas is jealous but I could.
not tell is he black is he white do he give me a fright? Can he spit can he.
rhyme can he flow anytime? Nah mean?
Y'All seen? I'm about to make history just stop and listen to me at-least have.
some decency and I'm out.
Back in now. I'm yung don't Y'All see.

these niggas sayin 'Look!' Did I.
mention that I spit venom tryin' kill all my enemies slowly destroying the.
next MC that lies in front of me?
Don't need I remind you, I'll be rhyming til im 70. By then? I'll prolly be a DJ And don't forget it nigga you heard it first from your.
nigga, Yung Tre.
