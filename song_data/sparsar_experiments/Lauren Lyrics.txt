Lauren Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

I like the way.
You say my name.
The way you.
Stretch out.
The middle vowels.
So there's a smile.
On your face.
But you live.
So far away.
I wish that I could just.
Pick you up and put you.
In a closer place.

Lauren.
When will I.
See you again?
When will I.
Finally get back to you?
Well I hope that it's soon.

Half the country.
Isn't nearly far enough to.
Cancel the connection.
Which has quickly grown.
Between us.
And I feel every mile.
That is keeping you from me.
And I can't wait until.
They melt away.
Beneath your airplane seat.

And I hate all.
The Dallas boys.
Who fumbled with.
Your heart.
Because I'd do just.
The opposite.
If we weren't.
So far apart.
