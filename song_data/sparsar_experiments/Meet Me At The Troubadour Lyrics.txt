Meet Me At The Troubadour Lyrics
by Viza.

S'il vous plaît a rendezvous for just a few crazy drunken men.
S'il vous plaît a rendezvous just with you....

Meet me at the Troubadour with your violins.
Meet me at the troubadour, bring your theremin.

S'il vous plaît a rendezvous for just a few crazy drunken men.
S'il vous plaît a rendezvous just with you and your foreign friends.

Meet me at the Troubadour for some ambience.
Meet me at the Troubadour under the influence.

S'il vous plaît a rendezvous for just a few crazy drunken men.
S'il vous plaît a rendezvous just with you.

Where you going?
Where you going oh little girl?
Where you going?
Where you going my little pearl.

I feel the waves through my veins out down the hall.
I feel at ease knowing you'll be my doll.

Meet me at the Troubadour read the napkin.
Meet me at the Troubadour much to his chagrin.

S'il vous plaît a rendezvous for just a few crazy drunken men.
S'il vous plaît a rendezvous just with you.
