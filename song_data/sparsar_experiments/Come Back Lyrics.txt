Come Back Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


All my life been stuck trying to get by.
Oh my I've been fucked trying to get my.
Shit up and at it, it's become quite a habit.
Til things things go away.
I never lose once I've had it.
That's not right, no luck crying in just.
Uphill fight, this rut's kinda been such.
A one-way ticket.
I'm the one person with it.
Hard as I try.
I just can't seem to ditch you.

One step closer 'n further away.
I'm one giant leap back from where i wanna be at.
That isn't me I gotta hustle my socks off.
Wait for the day that I've made that I've not got.
One step closer 'n further away.
Just one more stride, and I'll be alright.
I'll be on time.
Be on pride.
I keep on tryin.
Keep callin.
Imma keep on keepin it locked.
We're gonna keep on keepin on keepin it locked so.

Clap ya hands to the beat yo.
Jump up out of yo skin.
We've come a long way to be here so let us in.

The more I see it ain't easy.
I'm bought to break, fall down and collapse.
And the farther I'm gone I gotta feeling I won't come back.
So come back.

All my life's been a helluva sitcom.
Oh my I've had a helluva trip.
Going up and up and have a long way to go.
Get to the top, flop and fall way belooooooow.

No that's not right.
Been working in ?slaver?
My uphill fight.
Got me working all day 'n' night.
Like it, love it, or leavin leadin this way I like.
Want it, need it and when i see it.
I sing it like this.

Twenty-two years putting in sweat and blood.
Too many moons, here building up respect and love.
So tell me who here wants to get hype?
Turn up and just jump.

Ooh yeah.
I've been ?pressed? for luck.
But it's a new year, came back, stepped it up.
And the best of us ??????? Colfax.
With these big ??? you gotta time ??? left, come on.

Clap ya hands to the beat yo.
Jump up out of yo skin.
We've come a long way to be here so let us in.

The more I see it ain't easy.
I'm bought to break, fall down and collapse.
And the farther I'm gone I gotta feeling I won't come back.
So come back.
