Bob Your Head Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

Bob your head...

D.M.C..
As we bop on...
To the break of dawn...
The non-stop hip-hop bop...
Takes you on down...
To the last, STOP!! ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin...
So won't ya bob your head.. ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin...
B-b-ba bob your head.. ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin...

Run.
A freak I find the kind to wine and dine.
I freak a blind date, and your fate is to wait in line.
At the party.. tryin to get a hottie.
Cool T and Roddy, D.M.C. and Scottie.
Big Kev and Marty, Hurricane and Arty.
Phil, Doug, and Naughty - damn, a big party.
So I grab the mic, I like, recite, the hype.
And type, and write, with my...
Freak it 'fore the niggy night is done.
For Ricky-Run to get dumb and then some.
So while you're here, it's clear to every per-son.
Ah that you need to bob get involved.
And weave with ease and please the steez with G's.
Now, just to be at ease.
Cause this is it, legit, a hit, I throw a fit.
Not slackin or lackin a bit, nah that ain't it.
So just a bob ya head, like I said, the fresh it.
So just a bob ya head.. ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin...

D.M.C..
Bob your head! ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin...
ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin...

I make your heads bob, I got you slobbin the knob.
So do a good job, why don't ya let me know - HOW YA LIVIN HOBBES?
Whassup wit ya girl? Ya know I like the way your earrings jang.
And your booty swing, ah while my beat go.
BOOM BOOM - why don't you let me take you to my room.
Take off our shoes relax sit on bed and watch the Looney Tunes.
But no! You want me take you out and wine and dine you.
But I ain't got no time to chase behind and never find you.
So be this dope a lethal dose of poisonious potion.
Stick to the sound that's up and down now sit ya that's the motion.
Buckwild inna style for ya honey child.
The organization of bobbin and pacin will make you bob a while.
Grab a cutie, Duke her Bootee, bust a ?? box.
That's my duty, girl please do me, don't try to cockblock.
Give nuff respect, I love the sex, again I said...
Here it comes from Run  'Yo D!' HOE BOB YA HEAD.

Well I believe you weave and bob the job is done.
By Run so come get some for fun.
Keep the force I'm nicky-number one.
And I'll scratch my vocord for f-f-fun.
And nevertheless I must confess that it's a bless-un.
That people are ride and must abide to this direct-ion.
I triple it up to let you know that I'm a swift one.
Those who oppose get broken nose that's how I live son.
I move the head that's what I said, this is my miss-ion.
I'm dickin em down and all around, to make the head bob.
So bend your neck, give nuff respect to me, dance Hobbes.
For this is it, the brand new shit, I'd like to mention.
So hurry up because the cut is my inven-tion.
The jazz, pizazz, with class, at last.
Kickin your ass, for the past.
Three and a half minutes, you been in it to win it.
So you defin-in-it..-itely need to bob your head.

And I say!
I'd like to give a shout out to the Hollis Crew, in there!
My homeboy D.M.C., he's in there!
To my homeboy Jam Master Jay.
And the brothers at JMJ, you know they in there!
To my man Eric Blam, in there!
To my man Grand Wizard Cut Professor DJ Dig, definitely in there!
My name is Run Love and I'm out of here with The Afros.
And the 40 Ounce CREW!
