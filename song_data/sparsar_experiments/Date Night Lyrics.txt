Hey, I overheard you guys carrying on about cars yesterday so, does that mean.
you can drive?
I was just thinking how great it would be to go for a ride.
How about you do the driving and I pack us a nice picnic lunch?

She sent a text to me.
She wanna go for a ride tonight.
I said, Are you sure you're ready?
She said, I'll see you at the mountain at night.

You see me toking, smoking, spinning on my wheel eating tofu.
Shout out Tatsu Ramen.
Fujiwara we be proud of you.
Pull up to a crowd now see me sliding through.
Watch these niggas scatter.
It don't matter I hit whoever I need to.
I pulled off with my niggas just to see you.
And now she blushing red in her 240.
Same color too.
Her friend got a blue 240 with.
a.
I sat down, what's up, we shake a hand then we smoke a few.
All my niggas brothers that's the only truth.
And to the folks that fuck with me I'll let you know I really fuck with you.
I pull off on a hater, I ain't notice you cause I'm Mr. Excellant, that's who she want, that's why she left.
you.

Keisuke Takahashi, Kyoko Iwase.
Are you sure it's alright to drop you off in this neighborhood?

Uh, yeah it'll be fine that's my house right across the street.
Well you said this was a pretty junky ride you just use for your dads work but.
I actually like it, it runs really good and it's small and kinda cute, like.
you.
