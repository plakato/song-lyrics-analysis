Make You Smile Lyrics
by +44.

Hoppus &amp; _Carol_.
The last time I saw you, you turned away.
_I couldn't see you with the sun shining in my eyes_.
I said hello, but you kept on walking.
_I'm going deaf from the sound of the freeway_.
The last time I saw you, you turned away.
_I couldn't hear with your voice ringing in my ears_.
Do you remember where we used to sleep at night?
_I couldn't feel you, you're always so far away_.

Hoppus &amp; _Carol_.
The first time I saw you, you turned away.
_I couldn't see you with the smoke getting in my eyes_.
I said hello, but you kept on walking.
_I'm going deaf from the sound of the DJ_.
The first time I saw you, you turned away.
_I couldn't hear with the noise ringing in my ears_.
Do you remember where we used to sleep at night?
_I couldn't feel you, you're always so far away_.

I don't, don't wanna take you home.
Please don't, don't make me sleep alone.
If I could, I'd only want to make you smile.
If you were to stay with me a while.

Hoppus &amp; _Carol_.
The next time I see you, you'll turn away.
I'll say hello, but you'll keep on walking.
_The next time you see me, I'll turn away_.
Do you remember where we used to sleep at night?
I couldn't feel you, you're always so far away.

I don't, don't wanna take you home.
Please don't, don't make me sleep alone.
If I could, I'd only want to make you smile.
If you were to stay with me a while.

I don't, don't wanna take you home.
Please don't, don't make me sleep alone.
If I could, I'd only want to make you smile.
If you were to stay with me a while.
