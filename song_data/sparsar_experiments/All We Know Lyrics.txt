All We Know Lyrics
by Virtuoso.


Utilizing all we know.
True to life and.
Ten-Four I read you.
You're see through.
I don't believe you.
It ain't what your skin hides that's inside.

Sliding in key locks locked in the detox.
Amazing escape and evasion plots.
Black stone, chiropractor crack you backbone.
Spectacular when I rap to ya, it's on.
And after I masquerade this mic massacre.
Last of the B-Boy master spell casters.
High-roller, lash the beat.
Fantastically and put em' fast asleep.
Don't discuss this travesty with his majesty.
My styles make bullies look bashful.
Y'all heard of casual, I get any advised.
I rhyme in every minute to be miniaturized.
Squeeze the chalice, till my hands get calices.
Challengers get they ass kicked into spastic paralysis.
I place pillows in cigarillos.
Stuff them bitches to their thickest dildos.
A nigga will though, marinate till I mildew.
Off a brute dub-sack then and I peel too.

You skeez' us, please us and I leaves ya.
Lamping, with your tramp in the Hamptons.
Amped' bout' to run throught they camp then I'm vamping.
Like a champion, having fun when I run this.

Utilizing.

True to life and.
Ten-Four I read you.
You're see-through.
I don't believe you.
It ain't what your skin hides that inside.

This is the source so know that we hitting you off.
I'm forward progress increased with centrifugal force.
And as I listen I think who did the mixing on your weak sound.
That lacks essential punches like the presidential recount.
Deep down address the state of my being.
And break in museums to take back our freedom from snakes and demons.
We end off, when that cat rap it's Ten-Four.
You're see-through, I read you they speak your memoirs.
Flash ridiculous flows, master physicist.
They be like yo that's the hypnotist the way I get with chicks.
Sick of this pre-imposed regiment, we disclose evidence.
Of the societal foes decadence.
The righteous, we gaining advantage we banish sharks of Satan.
Battle the biggest star fuck it bring on a constellation.
Watch how I kill and fray the Milky Way the silky spray.
Filthy gray clouds, to send them to Earth to slay crowds.
In evil assemblages, walk straight mind control of cerebral appendages.
So it'll lead to your hemorrhages.
Quite likely, cuz' you spread rumours your might fight me.
But neglectly to write nightly thinking my hype might be.
Overblown, but I'm the most powerful of Jehovah's clones.
Poison will, thought they said poison milk from the Cobra's pulm.
Figure is Virtuoso slay hard.
In a rave squad, with brave guards and layed them in the graveyard.

Deep within we begin through the grass and moss.
Spent a wife from the plantation planned grand larsany.
My state's malnutrition a low adjustment what's this.
Identify then decide.
Virtuoso was hopeful, Cas was aggrivated.
I knew he had to make it, any task taken.
Sink or swim, die young or live in wrinkled skin.
Only look again cuz' homies think cuz' thinkin' in.
The same civilization, my pen is inkin' it.
Of the wise they a minus cuz' wise is a mindset.
Dumb, deaf, blind and no time reminding.
Your ass stays greedy, needy while I fast.
And I'm a start there leave em' marked there.
That every thought's clear and concise.
They say they lived twice.
And try and do me like Christ with spice.
Dancing with Manson but I ain't that type alright.
A fly Cas-wise, crack survival tactics.
Relax and meditate and apply.
