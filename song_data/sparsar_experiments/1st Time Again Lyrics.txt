1st Time Again Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


You came into my world and taught me thangs.
And I can't lie cause boy you did yo' thangs.
Feel like I'm floatin when I hear yo' name.
I think you made me fall in love again.

Okay.
Screwed Up Click.
Yeah.

Z-Ro.
Whenever you need a nigga call me up I'm on my way.
Sex or serious conversation, I'll listen to what you have to say.
This ain't gotta C about a wham bam thank you ma'am.
I'm not like these other fellas although I know you think I am.
Even though I kick it with a lot of - females.
I can honestly tell you that I ain't gotta - female.
But since I'm fresh out of jail you probably thank that I just wanna bone.
Hit it, quit it, then delete your # from my mobile phone.
Can't you see the tattoo reads one deep.
So I need only one lil' momma, one cup of codeine and one Swisher sweet.
Weight of the world is on my shoulders because I'm thuggin.
But sometimes even the hardest of us need some lovin.
And the first time with you is like my first time again.
Like rediscoverin rap music, writin my first rhyme again.
You say you feel like you're floatin, well I'm floatin too.
Everybody's leavin, now you know it's time for you and Z-Ro to do.

Z-Ro.
Now tell the truth; I'm like a mechanic when I work my tool.
So brace yourself baby so I can hit you with the mule.
Everytime I touch ya I'ma find a new hot spot, it's guaranteed.
I'm a thug nigga but still a romantic so pass the weed.
Now you ain't no dimepiece, you a whole dollar.
And I'd rather be givin you Fuck Faces.
Ain't tryin to pay these hoes no bother.
You see I consider myself as a king.
But I can't reach a comfort zone 'til I find myself a queen.
So we can rule together, it's picture perfect me and you together.
Go through our good and bad moods together.
Plus I'm concerned if you don't come home.
Long as you call me and let me know you alright I'ma stay offa ya phone.
Ain't none of that drivin by ya mama house or callin private.
The way you hug me when you see me let me know you my chick.
And I ain't scared to put that icing on your finger either.
You're my sunny day when it be rainin.
It's a blessin momma sing for the future.

Z-Ro.
Me and you is like a feelin that I get when I roll on 22's.
And I'ma keep you stylin when I'm shoppin for you.
Plenty ice, plenty clothes, plenty shoes.
But don't get it confused, I ain't trickin cause I'm pimpin.
But without you in my life I would be barely livin, mayne.
What we do in my arms is like doja to the brain.
I promise you like a drug you're much better than everythang.
Now if I was to try to hold in this love, I would choke.
Cause it's some potent shit like from Humboldt County on the West coast.
Yeah I think I fell in love again, it's on.
It's so real I feel I won't have to make another I Hate You Bitch song.
