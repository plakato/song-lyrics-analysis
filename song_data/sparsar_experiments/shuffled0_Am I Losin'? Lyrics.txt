Am I Losin'? Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Because your friend, Lord, is the most important thing.
Why am I losin' one of my best friends?

Am I losin' a good friend that I've known?
Now my friend won't talk to me, let me tell you why.
But, Lord, I always had a good time.
It's you, my friend, that's really changed.
Its a shame, such a shame.


Why these things happen, Lord, I don't understand.
Am I losin', won't you tell me how I've sinned?

Am I losin' my own way back home?
Why won't my friend take me as I am?
Your so-called friends want to act just a little funny.

He thinks I've changed because of a dollar sign.
Am I losin' once again?
It goes to show, Lord, you just can't tell.
Yes, they'll blame you.
And I recall this friend of mine I knew so well.
I recall when I used to come home, never had a dime.
And I recall drinking wine with one of my friends.
But I'm not the one that's here to blame.
Lord, I can't go back again.
But, Lord, it can sure hurt a man.
And it's so strange when you get just a little money.
