Bring Back The Music Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


What happened to the music videos. 
All, I see is Jersey Shore and these stupid Diddy shows 
Really, though get'em on a different channel 
You can soak up all the so-called reality you can handle 
Because. I don't give a shit about the crib Nelly lives in 
Or. What'S in his fridge in his kitchen, 
It make me wan na turn off my television 
It's, all irrelevant bullshit man, I'm telling you 
Can't stand the smell of it. 
I mean really: What kind of world is this 
They give their time to Girlicious 
Instead of giving it to legitimate artists 
That work hard
