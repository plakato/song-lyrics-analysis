Bring Back The Music Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


What happened to the music videos?
All I see is Jersey Shore and these stupid Diddy shows.
Really though, get 'em on a different channel.
You can soak up all the so-called reality you can handle.
Because I don't give a shit about the crib Nelly lives in.
Or what's in his fridge, in his kitchen.
It make me wanna turn off my television.
It's all irrelevant bullshit, man, I'm telling you.
Can't stand the smell of it.
I mean, really? What kind of world is this?
They give their time to Girlicious.
Instead of giving it to legitimate artists.
That work hard &amp; put their world hearts in this shit.
I wish they could see that and bring the old MTV back.
With no video's, it's like an empty weed sack - it's useless.
So bring back the music, if y'all refuse to do it.
We can always YouTube shit, but still....

Now....
Video killed the radio star.
And kids won't turn their stereo's on.
Kids need something to view the auto-tune in.
I write these words and bare my whole heart.
Expose my soul over beats I flow on.
And hope they evoke emotions.
And open up ears that yesterday were roped off.
Closed minds only pay attention to the co-signs.
And clothing designs.
While the op-pest dies.
I hope that mine, can find in my home to rotate.
I know, I don't quite fit the mode, no.
But why should I live below the so-so's?
I won't swallow the soil of those holding the spoons.
Forced down your throats.
No....
