Collide Lyrics
by Ruse.

You know I won't start taking pictures until the trip is done.
You know I won't stop blowing kisses at everyone.
It's not where we are it's where we're going that gets me inside.
Right where the heart and the headache where they collide.
Straight to the heart of the problem but the damage is done.
I pick up the phone call the medics but they never come.
Swept under the rug where no one can see.
I've already lost a small part of me.
Take what you want.
No please just take what you need.
Love pull me.
Love heal me.
Oh how she comes when we collide.
Not now you'll say this is the game we play.
And our love comes when we collide.
It drives us apart, this attraction.
It won't be our fault.
Stand with your feet on the stairway but you never walk.
When will you move.
Leave here for good.
Can't break the strings that you never could.
It's all that you want.
Its all that you need.
Love pull me.
Love heal me.
Our love comes when we collide.
Not now you say.
This is the game we play.
Our love comes when we collide.
Can you feel it.
Can you heal it.
No?
Love pull me and love it heals me.
Our love comes when we collide.
Not now you say.
This is how the game is played.
Our love comes when we collide.
