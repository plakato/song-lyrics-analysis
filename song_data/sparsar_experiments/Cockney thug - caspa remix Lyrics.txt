Cockney thug - caspa remix Lyrics
by Rusko.

Let me tell you something, son.
When your spirit is floating down that tunnel, towards the light.
You know what's behind the light?
It's not God, it's me!
And I'm gonna kick your poncey soul.
All the way back down the tunnel 'till you choke on your own f***ed up ribs!
Now....
Wake the f*** up!
Caspa!
F***!
Oh, f*** me.
F***! 2x.
....
And b****es all love me cause I'm f***ing Caspa.
F***ing s***, hehehe.
F***!
Oh, f*** me.
F***! 2x.
Oh, f*** me.
F***!
Let me tell you something, son.
When your spirit is floating down that tunnel, towards the light.
You know what's behind the light?
It's not God, it's me!
And I'm gonna kick your poncey soul.
All the way back down the tunnel 'till you choke on your own f***ed up ribs!
Now....
Wake the f*** up!
