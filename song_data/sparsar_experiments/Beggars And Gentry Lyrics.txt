Beggars And Gentry Lyrics
by Vision.

Beggars and gentry, give 'em all an entry.
Dying for a pass to your timeless affair.
Make a concession, ignore their transgressions.
Raising a glass, they're unaware.

So drink down that sloe gin fizz and plan your next vacation.
Your petty life turned into one financial saturation.
Salivate while you berate the younger generation.
And if you're smart, you'll never look to them for consolation.

Beggars and gentry, give 'em all entry.
Dying for a pass to your timeless affair.
Make a concession, ignore their transgressions.
Raising a glass, they're unaware.

You broke the dreams of others to meet your aspirations.
I guess in some demented way, you deserve congratulations.
Built a modest fortune on greed and subjugation.
What I would do if I were you is hide your face from me.

I know what you're all about.

Beggars and gentry, give 'em all entry.
Dying for a pass to your timeless affair.
Make a concession, ignore their transgressions.
Raising a glass, they're unaware.

So don't sit there and tell me you're such an inspiration.
You're a fake because it takes hard work and dedication.
It makes me sick, the thought of it - your filthy exploitation.
What I would do if I were you is hide your face from me.
