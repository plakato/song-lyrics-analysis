Goodbye Samson Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


In the forest.
Pitch black parking lot smoking.
Gotta fucking blunt, in my lap, smoking in the morning.
Ima fucking killer I do it I slap a bitch then she toothless.
Im coming for you fucking chain or your necklace and then we moving.

Needle in my fucking flesh reason why i'm sweating b.
If you tryna flex you gone guess while i'm pressing heat.
All these drugs up in my body overdosing comfortably.
The heat will leave my body when i'm dead and I will cease to be.
Genocide in my eyes leave you bloody.
I'm just a junkie.
I fuck a bitch and i'm cumming.
I cut her throat in my dungeon.
They fucking always wanna suck on this dick.
Tell 'em that i'm real busy but I ain't doing no shit.

I'm talking GoPro music videos.
Boat loads sipping with the fucking hoes.
Rolling up up in the studio.

Knife with the blade.
Feeling like i'm in space.
Drinking water throwing shade.
Spitting bars out like it's pay to play.

Killing all these pussies.
When you spit I feel you rookie.
I'm just cooking like a bookie.

Mutilating the faces of bitches who just be here hating then i'm gone bitch.

I said i'm gone bitch yeaaaa.

Kill me, kill me.
Mothafucka kill me.
Kill me, kill me.
Mothafucka kill me.
Leave my body in the river.
Decomposing into cinder.
Stick the blade up in my liver.
Pull the trigger then we dipping.
