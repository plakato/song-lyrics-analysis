She's Got The Power Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Now check check out my melody/.
See I fell in love but love ain't never fell into me/.
Felt like an irrelevant punk/ a celibate.
Monk/ I feel so lonely and I'm telling you cause /.
Like Neyo, I'm so sick of every love song on.
The radio/ “You'll find.
someone”, don't play me yo/.
Sluty floosies don't phase me/ but then you came and.
I picked a whole big bouquet of upsy-daisies/.
She got me tripping/ like slipping/ on banana peels/.
Full of jolly, now I know how Santa feels/.
I blunder with the words/ smother all of her/.
Wonder has occurred/ I'll make a mother outta her/.
If her body is a Wonderland, than her mind/.
Is a big Benemoth, I gotta get in line/.
Butterflies/ in my stomach, got a whole conservatory/.
Just/ hope this my first love story but/.

Now you're gone, and I'm writing this song/.
Now you're gone, and I'm writing this song/.
I'm picking petals off the flower/.
She loves me, she loves me not but she's got the power/.

I thought I played it cool and kept my distance/.
Abided by the rules, paid close attention/.
So I shined up my shoes, ready to step in/.
Then she acted so rude, so I said F This! /.
Singing CeeLo's “Forget You”, the dirty version/.
You're kinda surprised, you've never heard me cursing/.
I gotta tell you straight up, like an obelisk/.
That If my life is like a box of chocolates/.
Then I'm a get/ mine back, shove it in your face/.
There's your comfort food, forget it I'm done with the chase/.
I'ma spit hot fire without a cinnamon heart/.
Won't miss you, got another chick filling your part/.
Nah, I don't, I'm lying, I'm just a bitter kid/.
Whose a little pissed, never got to bit her lip/.
I'm not a misogynist, I'm not angry at all women/.
Just you but I'm still reminiscing/.
Cause.

It's time for Valentine's Day to be abolished/.
Stab Cupid with his own arrow, don't need no accomplice/.
Ladies I understand you don't ask for guys/ who.
Are asinine/ as they pass you by/ rate your ass a nine/.
But I guess the task is mine/ to explain with fantastic rhymes/.
Exactly why/ you can't quite right snag a nice/.
Gentlemen/ you keep telling them/ to slow your roll/.
So please don't ask in the next breathe, where'd all the good men go? /.
Use to be like, ‘baby unless you a lesbian/.
Let's be in/ a relationship, or at least pretend/ you know.
