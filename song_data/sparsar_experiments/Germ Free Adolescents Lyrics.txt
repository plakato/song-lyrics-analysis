Germ Free Adolescents Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

I know you're antiseptic.
Your deodorant smells nice.
I'd like to get to know you.
You're deep frozen like the ice.

He's a germ free adolescent.
Cleanliness is her obsession.
Cleans her teeth ten times a day.
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away.
The S.R. way.

You may get to touch her.
If your gloves are sterilised.
Rinse your mouth with Listerine.
Blow disinfectant in her eyes.

Her phobia is infection.
She needs one to survive.
It's her built-in protection.
Without fear she'd give up and die.

He's a germ free adolescent.
Cleanliness is her obsession.
Cleans her teeth ten times a day.
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away.
The S.R. way.
