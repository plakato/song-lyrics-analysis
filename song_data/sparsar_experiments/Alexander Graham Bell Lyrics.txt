Alexander Graham Bell Lyrics
by Sweet.

A candle flickers in a window.
Two thousand miles away she waits there.
There's a young man thinking by a window.
How was she to know just how much he cared.
He always knew just what he could do.
He always knew that his dream would come true.

Alexander Graham Bell well, he knew darned well.
That he could find the only way to talk across the USA.
Telephone, telephone never be on your own.
Many many years ago he started something with his first Hello, hello.
Alexander Graham Bell.
Alexander Graham Bell.
Alexander Graham, Alexander Graham.
Alexander Graham Bell.

The sun rises early in the morning.
Millions of people still unaware.
Of something he discovered without warning.
So he could show a girl just how much he cared.
He always knew just what he could do.
He always knew that his dream would come true.

Alexander Graham Bell well, he knew darned well.
That he could find the only way to talk across the USA.
Telephone, telephone never be on your own.
Many many years ago he started something with his first Hello, hello.
Alexander Graham Bell, Alexander Graham Bell.

Alexander Graham Bell well, he knew darned well.
That he could find the only way to talk across the USA.
Telephone, telephone never be on your own.
Many many years ago he started something with his first Hello, hello....
