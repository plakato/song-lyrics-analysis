DissTRAKT (Diss) Lyrics
by Wonderstarz.

You're just an insult to Hip Hop.
A rip-off of Shady.
You wanna face me?
I ain't afraid to kill babies –.
Overpopulated and fucked up already.
This country's messed, killing you would be saving.
Third degree burns, I'm fuckin Adrian Brody.
Predator, killin' anything hot.
I'll take ya new single for pot.
‘Cause it makes me snort.
Alone I'm enough for you and your puppies.
No effects – natural –.
All you do is toy with VDJ, Cleveland.
Or some other shitty....
FREE! FREE! That's what you cheap-ass bitches see.
I'm Traktoring you, you don't realize.
Why we've been so silent for the last few months.
I'm making covers.
I only need my left hand for that.
What was I doing with my right?
I know what you think – fap!
Fuck you dumb fucks.
Imma write raps!
You thought we'll drop one?
You see, we'll murder your ass.
This is my natural voice.
This is a natural beat.
I'll put it on YouTube for everyone to see.
I'm capable of killing with my iPhone only.
Yeah this beat is Garageband.
Your beats are phony.
You steal tracks.
Don't give no name to producers.
We use royalty-free shit.
They make but we owners.
K/O you fags like I was Mohammad Ali.
You use skin color to diss me?
You agists will be sorry.
‘Casue Imma float like a butterfly.
And sting like a bee.
The Michael Jordan of Rap – Slamvee!
You go “Whee!”.
When you open ReverbNation and see:.
“These faggots are still stuck at Born Sinner”.
Catchin' bullets with magnum?
Or was it fag-num?
Dumbass words – pronouncing bad?
Dunnum if he's spitting or blowing.
‘Cause you guys spit.
Like you got a gnat in your groin.
Wizzy wizzy dizzy – that's what we'll do to you.
DIZZINESS'll give your fans a free passport.
Staring at you, eagle eyes-.
Waiting to be unravelled.
After these 13 tracks, we'll be unrivalled.
Why wait for that? Ensure that it happens.
With this piece of paper I'm staping on yas.
Yeah if I was Em, you'd be Kanye.

No need to rehearse.
NOW, destructing in your style.
Killing you tiny motherfucking germs with phenyl.
You got erectile dysfunction – penile.
Don't realize what'll happen to your charts.
If you deny that you farts will be scarred for life.
No wife or children, no parents nor life.
Stick yourself with a knife.
If you don't bow down to Spandan tonight.
Don't know him, the rap Van Damme, a'ight?
Beat Punisher, I'm the fucking DC guy.
Why? ‘Cause that's a topic that'll make you cry.
They said “Be what you can be”.
I said I'd be Batman.
Sponny Bee – that's a cute name?
Please! That's the name of the guy.
Who butchers thieves, MCPs.
Then acts to grieve.
Then kill their all.
Gonna have no reason to live.
Anyway, You got a GF in our school.
To raise your fan list?
That's low dude – and who you got a nerdy ass-face?
A Directioner, who dunno how to direct a play.
Who'll lay by when I slay you.
Too lazy – watch you on display.
You'll be two feet under, in dismay.
You don't deserve better than her.
I'll be sippin' Absinthe, smoking weed.
You gayboys be drinking gin.
Playing Assassin's Creed.
I'm a different breed – TIGER BLOOD.
Charlie Sheen – I don't bleed.
So tell your troops to retreat.
Keep your hands to yourself.
Stick your ‘band' up your ass.
You illiterate fascists go copulate a highland lass.
Give me a prank call again?
I'll drop your carcass.
Your band is like a brand of squid we eat.
‘Defiant Ink'? Squirts, like a pussy fing'ed.
Defiance is what your chick does when she's fucked.
I give mine enough orgasms.
To construct a mountain of oestrogen.
Need some drugs? Maybe she be stoned to get pleasure.
Here, take up a rock.
It'll mess up her system, ‘cause you no OG.
I've been laying back and playing this game since 13.
Yeah, just a teen? Have a rap sheet.
No clean deals with me, I'm just dirty.
You have many angles to diss me.
E.g.- “Your girlfriend ain't imaginary”.
Fuck you, dating the hottest of the hotties.
The only name on her lips –.
Sponny!
My lyrics, advanced.

Say you wanna sleep with mine?
Glue your ass to the ceiling.
You motherfuckers need to think before you diss.
We guys are painful like.
Stones, who ain't gonna get rid with your piss.
I write this whole thing, in my free time, in Howrah.
Guess what I can do full time you pedophilic leora.
‘Shit! This nigga ain't dope' – that's your opening line?
You as basic as soap, we as complex as smoke.
Two puffs you're dead, broke, outside on the road.
Since I was dissing I thought I'd diss all my foes.
Rappers, mates and then all ‘em hoes:.
So mates, there's one in particular.
Thought he was on my team.
But he's just a regular piece of shit.
Mess up your jugular and eat.
Spaghetti and meat – yum yum.
Chop, chop! I'm a hungry rapper.
Shot in the back of my head.
Like your DP, I'm Wolverine.
Can't get rid of me.
You sold out? Won't realize in two weeks.
You won't get her dude, not your level.
The Tao of Badass won't change anything.
It's turned shy men to flirts.
Who are GOOD!
But I don't believe it's turned horses to men.
I'm on fire, you fucking assholes!
Nikki – Naught U's supposed to release soon!
I let all my fury out with this tiny piece.
Cramped is my mouth, so I'm gonna get a kiss…
