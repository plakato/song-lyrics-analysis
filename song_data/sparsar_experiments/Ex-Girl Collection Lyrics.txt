Ex-Girl Collection Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Fourth, floor: room: 
Each girl, I've brought back home to bloom 
All fold on close inspection. 
Each one leaves 
A banner hanging from the eaves 
Marking the eve of election 
Ex-girl collection, 
, 
Why 
Into. Why not 
Into what else you got 
 
It's! Just how men mark time, 
Ann slams in 
Another, lightning round, begins 
This could get interesting. 
Where'S Ann been 
She pours herself a don't-ask gin, 
No ice and light on the bitters 
I'm done with quitters 
Why Charles. I found out 
Wipe that smile off your mouth 
I think it's tell-me time 
Britt hit hard 
She found my box of Beth's best cards, 
Hand cut and signed with'X's 
Called at work, 
Happy anniversary, jerk 
And. I just laughed at the timing. 
With you on line two still crying 
Why play sex on the cuff 
Does Beth, like it rough 
And, learn your dirty lines. 
And keep her hair cropped, 
 
Is this. How men mark time in couples, 
She cursed, 
 
As Ann hand on hip, accusing me to the rafters 
The words turn and spit 
And scorch right through to the plaster 
I'm called ten kinds of a bastard 
Curses come faster. 
Ann stands down, 
I think she thinks. There'S still some ground 
To run manoeuvres on, but 
Ann, so smart 
You couldn't even guess Beth's part 
She, said Beth must find you daring, 
I'm long past caring., 
 
Into Charles gone to pot 
In hotter water 
Line up to lift up a toast, 
To, the ones I Hurt most 
And how the well's gone lime, 
With Charles on the plow 
Roger over and out 
Slower, how men mark time, 
Fine 
, 
Why 
What else! You got
