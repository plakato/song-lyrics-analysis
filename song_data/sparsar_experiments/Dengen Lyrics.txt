Dengen Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


I'm at a point where I don't know which way to go.
I smoke a blunt cause that's how I let these stresses go.
I got powers, I ain't lying, so I gotta go.
If I release while I'm on Earth this whole bitch could blow.
You saw me flying in the clouds but don't tell a soul.
I'm so special, I can't even let nobody know.
I know her body better than her own body know.
She fell in love with a nigga, I ain't even know.
I told her we could never work cause I ain't human ho.
I gotta get back to my planet so that I can smoke.
We ain't got no damn police cause we don't need them hoes.
Fuck a hating nigga, all my niggas do is smoke.
My nigga Chris got some extra, so he finna' po'.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, I'm finna' hit the flo'.
She helped me to the bedroom then she closed the door.
I ain't stupid girl, I already know you know.
Why you tryna' be slick, lick my dick slow.
You only got about an hour then you gotta go.
I'm for real, cause you really can't trust a ho.
Let me tell you something that you all need to know.

I had a bitch but she didn't want to keep it real.
I had a clique but they didn't want to keep it real.
So now that I'm all alone I gotta keep it real.
That's on me, my nigga I gotta keep it real.
