I'm Sorry Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

I know I said it, I know I did it.
Maybe I went overboard to prove a point.
But sometimes my pride gets in the way.
Maybe I need some time away to get my head together.
Yeah, yeah.

Maybe this was my last chance.
I may never get to hold your hands again.
I can say that I'm a better man.
I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry that I tore your heart apart last night.

And I'm sorry if I scarred you again today.
I didn't mean to take your dreams  and make them.
Seem so trite.
I sincerely , completely  apologize for.
Doin' what I did.

Everything you taught me and everything you showed me.
It never seemed that I would listen to anything.
But you've got my attention more than you know.
I take it in, I dealt with it, but I waited too late.
To use it, oh... Oh....

Maybe this was my last chance.
I may never get to hold your hands again.
I can say that I'm a better man.
I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry that I tore your heart apart last night.

And I'm sorry if I scarred you again today.
I didn't mean to take your dreams  and make.
Them seem so trite.
I sincerely , completely apologize for.
Doin' what I did.

I've never ever been so.
You made me know.

If you never take me back again.

Do it  all over.
Again.
I'll never mishandle you ever again.

I'm so sorry that I tore your heart apart last night.

And I'm sorry  if I scarred you again today.
I didn't mean to  take your dreams and make them.
Seem so trite.
I sincerely , completely.
Apologize for doin' what I did.

I'm so sorry that I tore your heart apart last night.

And I'm sorry if I  scarred you.
Again today.
I didn't mean to take your.
Dreams and make them seem so trite.
I sincerely , completely  apologize.
For doin' what I did.

I'm so sorry that I tore your heart apart last night.

And I'm sorry  if I scarred you.
Again today.
I didn't mean to.
Take your dreams and make them seem so trite.

I sincerely , completely.
Apologize for doin' what I did.
