Go with happiness (live) Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Because the heart's a fool.
A stranger to the room.
Because the love has grown.
I had to leave you alone.
And if you're gonna go, go with happiness.
And if you're gonna go, go with happiness.
Because the promise failed.
Because we're off the rails.
An arrow straight and true.
A gift to me from you.
And if you're gonna go, go with happiness.
And if you're gonna go, go with happiness.
Because the heart's a fool.
A stranger to the room.
And because the love has grown.
I had to leave you alone.
And if you're gonna go, go with happiness.
And if you're gonna go, go with happiness.
And if you're gonna go, go with happiness.
And if you're gonna go, go with happiness.
