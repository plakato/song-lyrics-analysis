Are You Man Enough? (Joe Carrano Big Room) Lyrics

Are ya man enough? Have I said enough ?
Are ya man enough? One question.

I'm not no pollyanna.
I got yo' femme fatale.
My body is so damn slammin'.
Sometimes I scare myself -.

So, if you wanna step to this.
You're gonna need, a lotta cheese and.
A little bit of confidence.
And oh, if you dare to answer this.
It'll tell me all that I need to know.
Is it yes, or no, it's a simple question.

Are you man enough to be my man.
Tell me what you got that I don't have, I'm a.
W.O.M.A.N. - outside and in, I ask you again.
If you're man enough to be my love.
Then you know you gotta back it up, I'm a.
W.O.M.A.N. - from head to toe, act like ya know.

I been through, I been through the drama.
Don't need to play those games.
Still livin' at home wit' cha' mama.
Don't make me call no names -.

And, if you wanna step to this.
Ya betta be, the real thing.
Cause I don't need, no young trainees.
Yeah, if you dare to answer this.
It'll tell me all that I need to know.
Is it yes, or no, it's a, a simple question.
