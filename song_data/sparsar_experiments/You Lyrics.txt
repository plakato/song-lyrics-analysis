You Lyrics
by ZOOpfish.


Pardon me, but I seen you from a far.
Don't know where I've seen ya but ive seen ya before.
And I don't mean to be obscene but seeing you lean on the bar.
My brain and thing inside my jeans were scheming, feinding for more.

Told her something Cupid stupid then I asked her her name.
She said bla bla bla and that she never knew my first name.
Shit she know I rap and now she joking bout my world play.
Sorta self conscious, saw promise in her laughter.
Read me like her drink receipt asked me what's the matter.
It's a long story, won't bore me, led to chatter.
Then I asked her, who's you favorite rapper?

Our love is like a baby at a funeral.
It's crazy but it's beautiful, a saint as much as lucifer.
I'm losing you.
Not in terms of words but in actions.
It hurts but it happens, absurd but the fast is.
This fighting night in, night out.
Only lightens when the light out.
So just ride it, till you ride out.
With your knight in shining white out.
Cause you can try to erase the past, but, you'll still gon feel it.
More he try to be your man, you think about my realness.
Then he'll try to flatter you with chatter.
Doubt he'll sense the actin in your laughter.
Doubt he's gonna ask you what's the matter, I'll just ask you Who you love.
when we talk about it after.
