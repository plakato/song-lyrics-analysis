Dancing With The Devil Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Dancing With The Devil, 
 
If you're the chosen one 
How does it feel to be loved by no one 
If you're, the number 1 
Where. Do you run to? Can you hide behind the sun 
And? You hide there with your demons and you wait for night to come. 
 
They say that there's no oxygen again 
You're forcing down the lies, but you always get your way. 
Something tells me this was all arranged. 
You trick me once again: 
 
They call you Lucifer, 
The, fires are burning and you look the other way. 
I saw the funeral. 
I watch the devil. As he dances round me. 
But. He dances with the fever. 
And spreads the plague of war. 
 
They say that there's no oxygen again 
You're forcing down the lies, but you always get your way. 
Something tells me this was all arranged 
You trick me once again: 
 
Do, you really want to drag me down. 
And. Take me to the gates of hell. 
No, more dancing with the stars 
I did it all for you back then 
And. Look at me now: Im half the prisoner 
Half, the man. This life is resting in your hands. 
 
They say that there's no oxygen again 
You're forcing down the lies, but you always get your way. 
Something tells me this was all arranged 
You trick me once again
