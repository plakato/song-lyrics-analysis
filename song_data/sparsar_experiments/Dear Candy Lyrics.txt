Dear Candy Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

I was never near.
Just a shadow on your walls.
I was never here at all.

Dear Candy....

I was never yours.
You were never mine.
I was never near at all.

Dear Candy....

This was all a fantasy of yours.
This was just a dream you had.
And I was never here.
I was never here.

You were never mine.
I was never yours.

Whoah, Candy.
Oh, Candy.

Do you see me in your dreams?
Do you whisper my name?
Do you hear when my static rings in your ears?
Candy.

I was never yours.
You were never mine.
I was never near at all.

Dear Candy....

This was all a fantasy of yours.
This was just a dream you had.
And I was never here.
I was never here.
I was never here at all.
Oh, Candy.
