Conquer the world - bonus track Lyrics
by Russian Red.

We were so young.
But life is a murderer.
We stayed very long.
But light is a vanishing hope.

I had in mind.
To conquer the world by your side.

Conducts very strange lately.
Cause heaven's in danger for you and the rest.
It's all true if we die I lose.

I had in mind.
To conquer the world by your side.
