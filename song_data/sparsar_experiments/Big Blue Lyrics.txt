Big Blue Lyrics
by Sweet Valley.


Soulja, woo.
Sweet Valley.
With the legendary Juicy J.
Les go.
Ye, ye, ye.
Remember me, les go.

Ain't no way they gon' forget my name.
I'm a legend, putting in work, ever since I came.
Ain't no umbrella nah, it can't stop my rain.
Your in the carpool, I'm in the different lane.
I just wake up every morning, every morning and go get the change.
Do my own dirty work, and won't get a stain.
I'm too heavy in this game.
And you better know it, hustle speakers for itself.
Ain't even gotta show it.

With all this bread, need a bigger stomach.
My name ring bells, so you can hear it coming.
Made it all my own, they gave me nothing.
And I'm still stunting, like a set of crutches.

I'm so raw, stackin' up figures.
You know I do it big, nobody do it bigger.
I'm a legend on stage, yeah they takin' pictures.
I'ma so ball hard 'till I get a penalty.
I go so hard, make sure they will remember me.
My whole team winning even through the winter.
My whole team winning I can't take that loss.
Had to live my life, and make myself a boss.
Now it's new foreign coupes when I'm in the streets.
R.I.P to the track, cause you know I killed the beat.
So clean, yeah ain't nobody fresh as me.
I guess gold chains, foreign whips was my destiny.
I go hard for the fam all them we got.
Gotta kill everything til I'm sitting at the top.
Maserati ? that's a lot of gwuap.
And the streets still going crazy cuz my buzz hot.
And whatever they wanna do, know I'm with it.
Ass be SOD, youngest ever did it.
All white with the diamonds when I step out.
Young boss with the bag, I'm the best ?
My foreign expensive, my bitch delicious.
My swag the fittest, my rims got ?
Remember I'm getting it.
Remember me.
I go hard and get cake like every week.
Gotta stay focused while I get this check.
0-100 ye I turn up to the max.
So I go hard and the club make them damn shake.
Count so much money that it made my hand break.
