Great Is Thy Faithfulness Lyrics
by Virtue.

Great is thy faithfulness.
Oh God my father.
There is no shadow of turning with thee.
Thou changest not.
Thy compassions they fail not.
As thou hast been.
Thou forever will be.

Summer and Winter.
Springtime and harvest.
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above.
Join in all nature in manifold witness.
To thy great faithfulness.
Mercy and love.

Great is Thy faithfulness.
Great is Thy faithfulness.
Morning by morning new mercies I see.
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided.
Great is Thy faithfulness.
Lord unto me.

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth.
Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
Your strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
Blessings all mine with ten thousand aside.

Great is Thy faithfulness.
Great is Thy faithfulness.
Morning by morning.
New mercies I see.
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided.
Great is Thy faithfulness.
Lord unto me.

Great is thy Faithfulness.
Great is Thy faithfulness.
Morning my morning new mercies I see.
New mercies I see.
All I have needed thy hand hath provided.
Great is Thy faithfulness.

Meeee mee ee.
Yeah oh oh oh.
Great is Thy faithfulness.

Lord to me Your faithfulness.

Great is Thy faithfulness.

Great is thy Faithfulness.
