Miami Ultras Lyrics
by Yung Lean.

Refrain.
I'm not looking for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not looking for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.

Pop, pop, pop, drop this top, top, top.
I roll like a rock, rock n roll to the top.
I dont give a motherfuck, watchin' starwars smokin' pot.
I take what I got, I live till it stops.
Chop, chop chop, all my lungs stay rot.
I take what I got, you hate that you're not.
Like me and me I don't give a motherfuck.
What I am, what I'm not, polo down to my socks.

What person, they can't stop, I fly to the top.
F-f-fuck what you got, I'm off.
a pill, rollin' like a rock.
White diamonds countin' guap, I got marble on my watch.
I got slam doors out the front, I'll keep goin' till I'm out.
I got pockets like the plug, I'm movin' 'round all day.
Fade to grey, everythin' can't stay.
I smoke so much, went away.
I'm in leanworld, l-l-let my.
mind stay.
Whichever today, I love my brothers, we gon' slay.

Refrain.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.

I miss some places, I wish we lived on another earth.
You think you hate me, I know that it hurts.
Burn, burn, burn, my turn, turn, turn.
Burn, burn, burn, my turn, turn, turn.
I miss some places, I wish we lived on another earth.
You think I hate you, I know that it hurts.
I burned, burned, burned, my turn, turn, turns.
Take a way and yearn, yearn, yearn.

Refrain.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not looking for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.

Pop, pop, pop, drop this top, top, top.
I roll like a rock, rock n roll to the top.
I dont give a motherfuck, watchin' starwars smokin' pot.
I take what I got, I live till it stops.
Chop, chop chop, all my lungs stay rot.
I take what I got, you hate that you're not.
Like me and me I don't give a motherfuck.
What I am, what I'm not, polo down to my socks.

Refrain.
I'm not looking for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not looking for you.
I'm not for you.
I'm not for you.
