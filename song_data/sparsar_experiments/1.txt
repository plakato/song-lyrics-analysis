The shortest hope pulls at all.
The hems of my dresses now.
And pleads in the highest.
Pitched squeals that you ever heard.
Would you please let me under?
Would it be so hard now?
But I got my zip code revoked.
So there was less reason to hope.
That I could ever find a home.
Or least a place that we could talk.
Increase the drip to overdose.
And later on it'll hurt the most.
Cause either way you'll be alone.
Is there a place that we could talk?
