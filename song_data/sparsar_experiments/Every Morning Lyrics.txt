Every Morning Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.

Produced by Whoarei , The O'My's and Donnie Trumpet.

Sample: Sun Ra.
My story is not a part of history.

Why should it?

Cassette Change.

Every Morning when I wake I can't help but thinking of you, I'm dreaming of.
you.

Let's find the essence of life.
And battle through every strife.
Because somewhere between heaven and hell.
Are just songs of happiness we all can yell.
But I can't sing them alone, I need you.

Pretty pie, Honey Pie.
Sweet like candy yams.
Lips taste like butter.
Watch me melt in your hands.

Every Morning I wake up with a smile on my face.
Cause every sunrise I see is like seeing God's face.
Everything that the sun shines on is like a beautiful blessing.
Because love was invested.
I love the world, I love the skies, I love the birds.

fall.
But it's the circle of life. Nature, Human Nature.
I love our pursuit of happiness. I love all our smiles.

Washing away sadness and giving colour to a black hole.
I love God, I love my family, I love my friends.

I love what makes you, and I love what makes me.
I love seeing the best we all can be.
But I guess the thing I love the most is LOVE.
I LOVE to LOVE.
What about you?
