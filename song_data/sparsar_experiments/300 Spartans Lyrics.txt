300 Spartans Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


It's-it's-it's-it's D-Dash.
I need a healthy free bag.
Diamonds playing freeze tag.
Pussy nigga I bleed swag.
Shout to Reese homie.
Fuck with niggas, I'm 300.
They ask where I been at?
Bitch I been getting money.

Sy Ari Da Kid.
I say 300 niggas, 300 G's.
Promoters can't stand us, we show up 300 deep.
I say it 300 times, we what the streets wanna see.
Feel like 300 spartans, stomping with 600 feet.

Sy Ari Da Kid.
Squad up! Squad, squad.
Squad up! Squad, squad.
Squad up! Squad, squad.
Squad up! Squad, squad.

Sy Ari Da Kid.
Yeah.
3-3-300 spartans, leading and marching.
Swimming in women, I'm sleeping with dolphins.
Pay me no need for the bargain.
Laughing at broke niggas leasing apartments.
People are talking, saying I'm tripping.
I murder 'em, kill 'em, then pee on his coffin.
Barking, Sy Ari, fuck 'em, and leave 'em.
They treat 'em like he Mr. Marcus.

Mafio! Ma-Mafio!
No patience for sloppy ho's.
Translee checking in, checking in.
Like the lobby flow.
I sign by the X, and get them O's.
Tha-That's a kiss.
People that just don't give a fuck.
Tha-Tha-Tha-That's my niggas.

My niggas rolling round with that fully automatic.
Illmatic, God damnit.
If your bitch get it up, then you know she gotta have it.
I'm on every type of drug, if you know what I mean.
If you cross that line, we gon' make that sing.
Too much money to be getting, for you to be hating on me.
That's a bitch trait.
I'm too real, you too fake.
I got two guns, for that toothache.

My squad full of young niggas.
Drug dealers, Thunder Cats.
Chopper punk a nigga like Ashton Kutcher.
Make a nigga dip like a running back.
Pop up on you like a instant message.
Clapping shit, no jumping jacks.
My niggas like me, I done made this shit clear.
You front me a pack, I ain't coming back.

Sy Ari Da Kid.
I say 300 niggas, 300 G's.

Sy Ari Da Kid.
Squad up! Squad, squad.
Squad up! Squad, squad.
Squad up! Squad, squad.
Squad up! Squad, squad.

Dirt Game niggas, yeah squad.
K-Camp screaming link up.
300 niggas, that's 300 mu'fuckers.
Trying to get it in by the trucks.
I'm a hot young nigga, that'll take your bitch.
Too fly, I can land on a cloud.
Money on me, your ho on me now.
Too turnt and I can't turn down.

See I got 300 niggas.
That mean it's 600 pistols.
And if you run up, start talking shit.
We gon' let them things hit you, naw.
Ain't gotta be no issue.
Them things gon' let loose.
Them bullets get to barking, them biting pit bulls gon' get you.

I wet you, like a pan handle.
My whole city, they 'bout the action.
I light you up, L.A. gear's.
I'm going in, like close contractions.
Get the picture, emoji.
I rap, but I had that sack first.
Pussy nigga don't play with me.
I am live spelled backwards.

If a nigga, want his issue.
He can get it quick.
Know my niggas, got them choppers.
They pull up with them sticks.
And his bitch's legs.
Now we going hard.
I'll fuck your broad.
Guapo fucking with the squad.

Everybody know me.
I be scrapping niggas low-key.

But I don't really need it.
Cold D.

Ran-Ran through 300 packs.
In 300 minutes.
Bambino got a sack.
And I love to spend it.
I'm my own boss, cap'o, and lieutenant.
Great product, trap star.
Bi-Bi-Bi-Bitch I'm winnin'.

I'm-I'm-I'm squading up.
Ya'll niggas time is up.
Stevie Wonder with that chopper, bitch I'm blind as fuck.
Put them lighters in the air.
One-One time for Dunk.

Dae Dae got them applications.
Sign 'em up.

300 niggas.
That's 300 triggers.
Ya'll got 300 niggas, but ya'll got like zero killers.
We pull up with the pistols, my niggas shoot.
They won't miss him.
Disrespect, we gon' kill him.

Pop a bean and forget him.

I took 'bout $300.

I'm trying to turn up my town.
Nigga be cool, but you don't want a problem.
I ain't say a word, but these ho's gon' flop.
New A-Town.
And my nigga James, shit real.
Don't believe just watch.

O-O-Okay it's F Y B.
Pu-Put a 300 deep.

John John Da Don.
300 niggas.

We 300 deep.
We cut from the same cloth, so it's like 300 me's.
Homie say he don't believe, I guess he wanna see.
That's backwards, cause he's a vegetable if he wanna beef.

Ay.
I say them bitch niggas be hiding.
But real niggas move in silence.
Got 300 killers, 300 pistols.
Better know my niggas be wildin'.
And every one around be silent.
No flaw niggas in my circle.
Stay street, it's a code we follow.
Only moving's by them dollars.

Migos - Offset.
No-no-no solider but I got troops.
A whole bunch goons on the roof, they gon' shoot.
Cut the top off the head, just like a coupe.
What you wanna do?
We can fight, we can shoot.
Shit's getting nasty, wrap 'em in the plastic.
Throw him in the trash, now the nigga looking trashy.
Whole clique full of shooters, just like the Mavericks.
We don't give a fuck, put a nigga in the casket.

Migos - Quavo.
Extendo-Extendo longer than a ruler.
All my niggas, they shooters.
Place your order in Bermuda.
I got more keys than a computer.
Don't move wrong, he might shoot ya.
My team ballin' like Buddha.
31 in the clip, Reggie Miller.
Put you in the lake, no timber.

Migos - Takeoff.
300 like Chief Keef.
Squad up if you want beef.
I'mma tell you like a OG told me.
Migo plugged, they stocked in the street.
Wanna go to war like spartans.
Hit 'em with the carbine.
And I keep the strap, like Marvin the Martian.
Gas and the Glock in the glove compartment.
Free Westside, tell them fuck.

Okay I'm 300.
Million.
One more shout, free Meech nigga.
Rap game in a chokehold like-.
Go to sleep nigga.
Started from the bottom, now we here mu'fucker.
We some real mu'fuckers, and I feel great.
I'm Tabius Tate, I'm like Will Smith.
I'm a fresh price, and I fill banks!

44s and big Glocks.
Kush, coke, and flip lock.
Young God gon' flip drop, in big rocks, see the big watch.
Dope time, nigga tick tock.
Flip flop, get a big shot.

Dumb nigga got away punk.
Flip fling like a big shot.

G-Unit all on my back nigga.
I move weight like a fat nigga.
N O mane Zan nigga.
Throw my set up like bad dinner.
Ask yo ho, I'm that nigga.
Kidd Kidd, kidnap niggas.
Hit your family, bowtie'd.
And gift wrap with ya.
Merry Christmas.

I don't fall in line, I lead it.
Heads up, I'm so conceited.
I ain't never seen a dude that I needed.

Sweden in that B.M.
10 stars, they can't see in.
But it ain't no creepin', don't be sleepin'.
Supremacy 300, knee deep in.

Young Eastside nigga Jacquees.
In the coupe, probably doing top speed.

Got your girl, and she probably on her knees.

She 25, but I'm only 19.

This young nigga bout to blow.

I can earn my stripes.
So that they already know.

Drop 'em aside like Compton.
Potato on the tip like condoms.
Calculator clip, they don't want no problem.
4-5 Just like a pill, might pop 'em.
Uh, Goon's that'll shoot you for a hoodie.
Copped a camera man, just to get the footage.
Whole crew gon' mob, and I don't mean Goodie.
Hit him in the head, and he gon' need goodies.

Oooooh!
Yes, yes!
You just experienced.
Wrath of the Titans.
Monsters unite.
And it went down.
Heavy, heavy, heavy.
Ruuuuuuuow.
