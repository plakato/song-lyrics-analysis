300 Spartans Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


It'S-It'S-It'S-It'S D-Dash 
I need a healthy free bag. 
Diamonds playing freeze tag, 
Pussy nigga. I bleed swag 
Shout to Reese homie 
Fuck with niggas, I'm 300 
They ask where I been at 
Bitch. I been getting money, 
, 
, Sy, Ari Da Kid 
I, say: 300 niggas, 300 G's 
Promoters can't stand us. We show up 300 deep 
I, say it 300 times we. What the streets wan na see 
Feel like 300 spartans stomping with 600 feet,

Yeah, 
3-3-300 spartans, leading and marching 
Swimming In women, I'm sleeping with dolphins 
Pay me no need for the bargain 
Laughing at broke, niggas leasing, apartments 
People are talking saying: I'm tripping, 
I, murder'em kill'em, then pee on his coffin 
Barking Sy, Ari fuck'em and leave'em 
They treat'em, like he Mr. Marcus 
, 
Mafio Ma-Mafio, 
No Patience for sloppy ho's 
Translee checking in checking in 
Like the lobby flow 
I sign by the X and get them O's 
Tha-That's a kiss 
People that just don't give a fuck 
Tha-Tha-Tha-That's my niggas 
 
My niggas rolling round with that fully automatic 
Illmatic God damnit 
If, your Bitch get it up, then you know she got ta, have it 
I'm on every type of drug? If you know what I mean 
If, you cross that line. We gon' make that sing 
Too much money to be getting for you to be hating on me. 
That'S, a bitch trait 
I'm too real you too fake 
I got two guns for that: toothache 
 
My squad full of young niggas 
Drug dealers, Thunder Cats, 
Chopper punk, a nigga like Ashton, Kutcher 
Make, a nigga dip like a running back 
Pop up on you, like a Instant message: 
Clapping shit, no jumping jacks, 
My niggas. Like me, I done made this shit clear, 
You front me a pack. I ain't coming back, 
, 
, Sy, Ari Da Kid 
I say: 300 niggas, 300 G's

Ya'll got 300 niggas, but ya'll got like zero killers. 
We pull up with the pistols, my niggas shoot.

Pop a bean and forget him.

A whole bunch. Goons on the roof, they gon' shoot 
Cut the top off the head. Just like a coupe

We can fight. We can shoot 
Shit's getting nasty wrap'em in the plastic 
Throw him in the trash. Now the nigga looking trashy 
Whole clique, full of shooters, just like the Mavericks 
We, don't give a fuck put a nigga in the casket 
 
 Migos Quavo 
Extendo-Extendo longer than a ruler 
All, my niggas. They shooters 
Place. Your order in Bermuda

Don't move wrong. He might shoot ya.

31 in the clip Reggie Miller, 
Put you in the lake no timber, 
 
 Migos Takeoff

Squad up. If you want beef,

Migo plugged, they stocked in the street 
 Wan na go to war like spartans 
Hit'em with the carbine 
And. I keep the strap like Marvin, the Martian 
Gas and the Glock in the glove compartment. 
Free Westside tell them fuck 
 
Okay, I'm 300

One more shout free, Meech, nigga, 
Rap game in a chokehold like- 
Go to sleep nigga 
Started from the bottom. Now we here mu'fucker 
We, some real mu'fuckers and I feel great 
I'm Tabius Tate, I'm like Will Smith 
I'm a fresh price and I fill banks, 
 
44s and big Glocks 
Kush coke and flip lock, 
Young God, gon' flip drop in big rocks, see the big watch. 
Dope time nigga tick, tock 
Flip flop get a big shot. 
 
Dumb nigga got away punk 
Flip fling like a big shot.

Ask yo ho I'm that nigga 
Kidd Kidd, kidnap, niggas 
Hit your family, bowtie'd, 
And gift wrap with ya 
Merry Christmas, 
 
I don't fall in line. I lead it 
Heads up, I'm so conceited. 
I ain't never seen a dude that I needed 

Sweden in that B.M. 
10. Stars they can't see in 
But it ain't, no creepin', don't be sleepin' 
Supremacy 300 knee deep in 
 
Young, Eastside, nigga, Jacquees 
In, the coupe, probably doing top speed, 
 
Got your girl and she probably on her knees, 
 
She 25, but I'm only 19 
 
This Young nigga bout to blow 
 
I can earn my stripes 
So that they already know 
 
Drop'em aside, like Compton 
Potato on the tip like condoms, 
Calculator clip they don't want. No problem. 
4-5. Just like a pill might pop'em 
Uh Goon's that'll shoot you for a hoodie 
Copped, a camera man just to get the footage. 
Whole crew gon' mob, and I don't mean Goodie 
Hit him in the head and he gon' need goodies. 
 
Oooooh 
Yes, yes, 
You, just experienced 
Wrath of the Titans 
Monsters unite 
And. It went down 
Heavy heavy heavy 
Ruuuuuuuow
