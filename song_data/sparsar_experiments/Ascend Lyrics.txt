Ascend Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


We are passing into a great change of species.
And no matter how loudly the old authorities.
May proclaim that this is not so, it is going to happen.
Our moment of time, when population reaches it's limit.
And the world as we know it ends, is not about death at all.
It is about ascending into a new kind of life.

They only see to the sky.
Our dreams and our lives.
Our means to survive.
But not between our eyes.
We gotta free our minds and re-design them.
Seek and find the trees to climb high and.
Read the signs between the lines.
Defeat the lies discreetly hiding deep inside them.
Sheep unite and beat the tyrant.
Leave the island but keep smiling.
Cause why try to fit in.
To this life that has been.
Pre-planned to keep man in a cycle of sin.
The fight could have been won.
But we sit stunned.
As we get drunk and forget once we were tricked.
And now they can complete their goal.
Cause we're convinced that dung heaps are gold.
People sold to keep our souls dug in.
Deeper holes than we could know we're stuck in.

Now something is wrong with that... don't you think?

Life can be a sequence of precluded opportunities.
Just like déjà vu that never ends.
It seems our position as spirit beings.
On this physical journey's to make our moves and then ascend.
Life can be a sequence of precluded opportunities.
Just like déjà vu that never ends.
It seems our position as spirit beings.
On this physical journey's to make our moves and then ascend.

I know sometimes it seems like it's some kind of dream, right?
Some try to scream and reach the sunshining beams.
But the path is paved with choices, and the voices tell you lies.
But it's your choice, your life, don't wait for hell to rise.
It won't be televised in any case.
On any stations anyways.
Many wait for many saviors.
Many say that any day.
The penny's they attempt to save will buy them plenty acres.
And the petty labor's every day's work's fruit can then be savored.
Believe what you choose to but I refuse to surrender.
To the people that rule you and their ruthless agendas.
Spent a day away with me.
Don't slave this week or play the game.
End the pain, I'll make you see.
The sacred tree and break the chains.
Leave your alleys and streets, walk the valleys and peaks with me.
This is all ours if you and I can just leave it be.
Freedom is as easy as believing that we're one.
Breathing it in deeply and the healing has begun.

There has never been a better time to be alive.

Until we change our ways.
There's no fucking way they'll change their ways.
Manipulate our brains with the airwaves.
Our kids will face the same shit when they're slaves.
What gets me is they claim that it's fair play.
But label us insane if we dare say.
Anything that unlocks the staircase.
So they can keep us locked in a scared state.

Yeah, but until I change my ways.
There's no fucking way you'll change your ways.
So we'll keep celebrating Earth Day.
Even though it's clear it's merely wordplay.
What gets me is I know that they can cure AIDS.
Cause they control the healthcare and the birthrate.
Then indoctrinate us 'til we serve hate.
And incarcerate us in this birdcage.

And what frightens me is that... people are simply letting it happen.

Sweatshop.
You don't need to believe it.
Or even agree with it.
But give yourself time to make memories then leave it.
Innocent Bystanders.
