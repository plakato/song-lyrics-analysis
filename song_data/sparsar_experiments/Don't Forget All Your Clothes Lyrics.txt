Don't Forget All Your Clothes Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Don't forget all your clothes.
They'll be in my way after you go.
And I'm not mad, I don't mind.
But if you really wanna go leave nothin' behind.

I don't know why you're acting this way.
Covered in tears, blush on your face.
You tell me you're mad and stomp on my floor.
Fuss with your bags, baby, say we've known love no more.

But what did you say, you feel bad.
But there's someone else you found.
Well, since it's you who wants to leave me, baby.
And not the other way around, yeah.

Don't forget all your clothes.
They'll be in my way after you go.
I'm not mad, I don't mind.
If you really wanna go, leave nothin' behind.

Oh, tell me again cause I can't recall.
What I have said or done that's so wrong, so wrong, so wrong.
I promise you more, I'll give you everything you need.
Oh, look what I've done for ya, look what you're doin' to me.

So don't you give me those eyes.
That say, honey, you should know.
I was gone from the start.
Well now, it's better if you go, hey, huh.

Don't forget all your clothes.
They'll be in my way after you go.
I'm not mad, I don't mind, yeah.
If you really wanna go, leave nothin' behind, yeah, hey.

Who is this man that wants you anyhow?
Who's this man, babe?
Don't he know you're gonna leave him.
Like you left somebody else, baby, not too far from now?

Oh, oh, don't forget all your clothes.
They'll be in my way after you go.
And I'm not mad, I don't mind.
If you really want to go then, sugar.
If you really want to go then, baby.
If you really want to go leave nothin' behind.
Oh, leave nothin' behind, baby, yeah.
