Back Then Lyrics
by 67.


Add a K hold some corn 
67 free, the guys 
 
Remember kway back then 
Pushbike and my blade tryna dip, a man 
Now when we pull up 
3-litre with two I've got the skeng on man, 
Baking off on the Drive with the spinner 
I had two sweets On man 
If a boy did slip: KO 
The spinner would've span like fan 
 
I, remember broad day on your estate, big jacket, tryna dip, a man 
Bando cutting up hard same time. I got some am on man. 
Two Z's up in the trap, spent more than a band on that 
New mixtape out soon. We should make a few bands off that 
Yeah. I'M tryna make bands off rap 
My niggas, don't care about fashion. We just want more new straps 
Had a big hand gun at 15. I took it on the bus and that 
First time I grip that 12. I was really tryna crash off man 
All, you hoes. Let me breathe. I'M out in the streets getting p's 
I. Put my key in ignition, then I press gas, then speed 
Dotty come like a branch. I'Ve got a bag. I don't put it in jeans 
Woosh man down, then I go bake off and smoke weed 
Peng, tings wan na do me and do my whole team 
She said that she wants a bad man that smoke's nuff weed 
I'm a bread, man, skeng man. I got a dotty, that's big, like Liquez 
If, I walk with the broom and you walk in my way. Then a man gone, sweep 
, 
Remember kway back then 
Pushbike and my blade tryna dip, a man 
Now when we pull up 
3-litre with two I've got the skeng on man. 
Baking off on the Drive with the spinner 
I had two sweets on man. 
If, a boy did slip, KO 
The spinner would've span like fan, 
 
I'm, surrounded by shooters, and we got a whole of the guns. 
Been gripping them, shotguns, 
Been gripping them from young, never showed them. No love, 
My niggas get cake and them niggas get drums. 
My niggas all come and my niggas all run 
Run leg cah. They know for sure ima back my gun, 
If. I can't find you when I lurk on your block. Then I guess that's home visits 
Free, my nephew D Rose. They got him locked down on closed visits, 
35 yeah, I'm cold with it so mind, you don't get smoked with it. 
674 gang New Park, Tilson Foster, yeah, we're known hitters,

Drillers, drillers, drillers drillers gang gang alla dat 
Niggas know get me

Yeah. You know what it is: Sixty's 
Mad itch gang gang gang, 
Shit den shit, up,

Remember kway back then 
Pushbike and my blade tryna dip, a man 
Now when we pull up 
3-litre with two I've got the skeng on man. 
Baking off on the Drive with the spinner 
I had two sweets on man. 
If a boy did slip. Ko 
The spinner would've span like fan
