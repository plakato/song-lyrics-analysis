The Table Set Lyrics
by X.E.X.

Baby.
I think you got an X-ray.
Through your game.
Blame the prey.

Maybe.
You ate a Friday.
Instead of Sunday.
Cuz you're at the grave.

But wait!
I can cover this.
Seal it with a kiss.
My hearts the only exit.
There ain't no list.

So let me cure this.
I know you can't resist.
Its OK i got the lights off.
I think this night will be enough.
To save you rough.

Be tough.
Its all free love.
Fill your heart up.
Till it finds the top.

I'm drowning in you.
My obsessions proof.
Wake me.
Taste me.
Love me.

I'll keep your secret.
I'll guard your secret.
Don't worry don't fret.
I've got the table set.
