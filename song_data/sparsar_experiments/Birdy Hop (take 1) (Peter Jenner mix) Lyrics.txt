Birdy Hop (take 1) (Peter Jenner mix) Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

Birdie hop, he do.
He hop along.
A lonely bird upon.
A window there, he, he.
There he blow.
A windy snow, he knew the snow.
I know the snow, a hoppy bird.

The antelope ride around the parasol.
Just to see if he's a man enough.
To meet you in the sandpit.
On a flying kind of sighing.
In a meddlesome way.
You know the way.
I see the flies.

She's a little kite, the sort you think you might.
Like to fly 'er and like a kite.
You get to see her every night.
You know the way.

She's only paving her way.
Hectachrome plane.
I see the flies.

Birdie hop, he do, he hop along.
A lonely bird upon.
A window there, he, he.
There he blow, the windy snow.
He know the snow, a hoppy bird.

A camel woke up to a polish dawn.
Wouldn't look to see his feet had gone.
He wouldn't like it.
Wouldn't have the strength to fight it.
I see the flies.

I'm the only bird, a little third.
I lost a quarter, had a yearning.
To be earning just a dollar a day.
And in a way you shouldn't like it.
Hectachrome plane.
I see the flies.
