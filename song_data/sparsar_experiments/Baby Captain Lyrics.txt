Baby Captain Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

Black phoebe.
Theres a candle in my window.
Black phoebe.
Its all inside of you.
Black phoebe.
Theres a candle in my window.

Baby captain.
I hope those teary eyes.
Are only from x.
And i hope they.
Dont dry.
When your biking photos.
Set you free.
And you see.
What a stunner you are.

Get me a captain.
I hope that white gold girl.
Forgets about you.
Your crooked blood.
Seeps up from hell.
And you see.
What a stunner you are.

Black phoebe.
Theres a candle in my window.
Black phoebe.
Its all inside of you.
Black phoebe.
Theres a candle in my window.
