X-Ecutioners Song Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

January 17, 1977. It's early morning at the Utah State Prison. Reports and TV.
crews are on hand to witness an event. Capital punishment has not been.
practiced in over 10 years in the United States. Surrounded in controversy,.
Gary Gilmore was.
about to enter in the center of a vale of trouble.

X-ecutioner.
Only the strong survive.

You could run but no man is safe.
Hey keep the show crews running.
Like they're supposed to.

Is very simple and fun.
All it takes is good balance and good hand eye co-ordination.
Keep your eyes at the balls at all times.
Remember practice practice practice.
Let me show you how to do it properly.
