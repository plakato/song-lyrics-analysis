Doubtful Times Lyrics
by Voice.

Our existence is wretched.
Everywhere there's greed.
Honesty and courage count no more.
Our life's a selfish breed.

Staticstics, quotas and calculations.
Bad political games.
Follow us deep in our dreams.
And waste away our brains.

Destiny, Destiny.
Take your run.
Follow me, follow me.
Or your hyeart burns in the sun.
Of this doubtful times.

Our view for beauty.
Dries out on the way to arrogance.
In this world of lies.
Try to keep your balance.

Feel the wind in your hair.
With the hand on your heart.
Don't waste your time.
Try a new start.

Destiny, Destiny.
Take your run.
Follow me, follow me.
Or your hyeart burns in the sun.

Destiny, Destiny.
Take your run.
Follow me, follow me.
Or your hyeart burns in the sun.
Of this doubtful times.
