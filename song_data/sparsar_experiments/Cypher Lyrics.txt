Cypher Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


I'M in my second semester, the lectures festered and pestered 
I been stressin' to switch lessons. 
To sectors set to embezzle the rebels 
Looked as pebbles from the levels of the reigns 
So when it rains 
Was pebbles. Now several of the grains 
Insane from this College stint. 
Not game for no blue collar shit, 
Own lane against the grain 
So fuck your wave and fuck your barber bitch 
Don't garnish shit, 
Nay 
Two's, doable Three's accompany 
By; four, that's an art form 
Quo three! That'S real G 
Plot, my apartheid. Apart from these guys, 
Ride to the Pharcyde with SlimKid3 and FatLip 
My 90's rap shit, 
The Uth's with me influence kidney's 
Bobby
