Yeet Lyrics
by Quill.


Finessin' with the check got the hoes like YEET.
The gas I'm smokin on got the club like YEET.
Bitches on my line they on my phone like YEET.
Hop up in my whip and I feel up like YEET.
I got the hoes like YEET.
In the club like YEET.
On my phone like YEET.
When I peel off like YEET.

Showtime Showtime.
Callin' up my plug cause I know he got that YEET.
Bad bitch in my bed and she givin' up that YEET.
Fresh I fuck her, then it's fucked up.
Pass her up ?
Ask her what was that? that's that YEET.
I walk in and your bitch starin'.
Other niggas no comparin'.
We ain't cuffin' so we cheerin'.
I'm so fly catch me ?
With some J's on my feet.
She like my swag ?
And it's up to my ride, I pull up feel that YEET.

Peel off on that lap baby.
You know that's hot drop baby.
Bands we be blowin'.
Bad bitches rollin'.
Diamonds yes they glowin'.
?
Pocket full of money can't walk right.
Hate bein' broke don't feel right.
Got you ho on my side make you look twice.
? should know ? damn dice.
Hoes they be flexin' ? YEET.
And ye ain't talkin' money then you must be slick.
