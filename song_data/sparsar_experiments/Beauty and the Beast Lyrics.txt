Beauty and the Beast Lyrics
by Swoope.


She's got lust in her eyes, death on her tongue.
Chest full of pride, breasts got me sprung.
Nothin' but destruction on her mind.
But what's to keep me thinking that it's lovin' all the time, she told me.
That we can make love under the sunset.
And when the night falls we can name our son Death.
She calls my heart home, finally got the context.
That she's beautiful.

You ain't even see it coming, somehow you missed this.
You missed Mya, muah, ignorance is bliss, kiss.
These lips, tell me that you miss this.
Mistress I know, but tell me I'm the missus.
Dismiss this myth that I'm the Mrs.
Little less Miss Right, a little more mischief.
Got the smell of honey dripping from my lipstick.
I act cynic with my French kiss, make these lips stick.
Uh, I'm worth the trouble, please pay.
Don't keep your Love Locked Down, don't be Ye.
Who wants that perfect love story anyway?
Clich√© for Pete's sake, that's what Bey say.
So I'll be BK, you be Jay.
This time please stay, don't leave your dame.
You couldn't leave me if you wanted to.
Look in the mirror, I'm standing right in front of you.

She's got lust in her eyes, death on her tongue.
Chest full of pride, breasts got me sprung.
Nothin' but destruction on her mind.
But what's to keep me thinking that it's lovin' all the time, she told me.
That we can make love under the sunset.
And when the night falls we can name our son Death.
She calls my heart home, finally got the context.
That she's beautiful.

Johnny get red dress, oh I'm mighty fine.
I got you saying My three times.
Put a Ya at the end of 'em.
And I'll make you mine three times.
Lights out, you're Halloween my name.
No Bloody Mary, you're hollering my name.
Mya Mya Mya if you're following my game.
Oh I'm sorry baby, did I scare you?
It's hard to keep my crazy in check.
Never mind that, maybe put my fangs in your neck.
Am I a monster, am I a mystery.
Taking you out of and putting you in misery.
Cunning and crafty, stunning and sassy.
Seductive and sexy fox with one thing to ask you.
Will you die with me, coz death is.
The baby that's growing inside of me, and it's yours.

She's got lust in her eyes, death on her tongue.
Chest full of pride, breasts got me sprung.
Nothin' but destruction on her mind.
But what's to keep me thinking that it's lovin' all the time, she told me.
That we can make love under the sunset.
And when the night falls we can name our son Death.
She calls my heart home, finally got the context.
That she's beautiful.

And a monster.
