Dead Soul Lyrics
by Sworn In.

Clear eyes are quickly getting blurry.
All I feel is this fury.
And while mind sits to rot.
I'm trying to forget what I've been taught.
Nothing is real, it's an illusion, it's a trick.
The fog is getting thick, the fog is getting thick.
I've lost my soul and there's no going back.
Life seems to only have one fucking track.
Into darkness I go.
Don't pull me away.
Cause if I wanted to live I would have told you to say.
What's the difference between life and death?
I've been cursing your name with my every breath.
My soul is dead.
My soul is dead.
And all I can do is dig my own grave.
The way you act you must think it's funny.
But I know that life is not about love or money.
Life has no meaning, I'm sure of it now.
I'll take you to hell after taking my bow.
No need for you to hear.
Everything is perfectly clear.
What's the difference between life and death?
I've been cursing your name with my every breath.
My soul is dead.
My soul is dead.
And all I can do is dig my own grave.
Things are looking fucking bleak.
