Check It Lyrics
by Vizual.


Ha, Alright, Yea, uh, Are they ready for this one I don't know, Alright, Let's.
Go!

Process is runnin' the bar.
Over computer screens.
Almost 95%.
God is working through me.
People need'a to see order to believe.
Can't tell what's wicked or not.
Mind's so blurry.
You gotta check yourself.
Before you perfect yourself.
We ain't perfect but through Christ.
I get to check myself.
Living just so the truth.
Won't rust this world is corrupted.
Living from the inside out.
Using my freedom to love.
Not to lust.
Because lust bring up void.
Get all you want but.
Later on you're out of joint.
Broken down toys.
This ain't no playground.
Won't let people pressure my choice.
I have my crown.
Under authority by the king of kings.
Standing my ground.
Not feeling dead.
Walkin' dead.
I'm finally found.
Covered with that blood got me uh.
Love st-rucked.
Laying down my life.
On the cross.

Check it.
Can you take so much.
Food for your spirit.
Can you take so much.
Check it.
Can you take so much.
Food for your spirit.
Can you take so much.
Cause I've been going down hill.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Cause I've been going down hill.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.

Got problems with my joy.
Flowing through my voice.
So much excitement cause.
My vision from The Lord.
Don't need to escape reality.
Music is a gateway drug.
Fills your needs for a while.
But leaves you undone.
This is hope music, heal music.
Food for your spirit.
Some bind the soul.
From the problems that need fixin'.
Not dissing.
My aim is at the thrown.
Freedom from the world.
Leaving your heart so cold.
Trying to relate.
In the end He has the word.
Good job good and faithful servant.
Trying to finish this race home.
Couldn't beat my addiction.
Without the Holy Ghost.
Not a sinner but a saint.
Has a repentance lifestyle.
The Devil's a lair.
Got the truth written down.
He comes to grant false hope.
The void got me out.
Not fooled by my own voice.
Can't even trust myself.
Rolling with the spirit.
Pressing the breaks woah.

Check it.
Can you take so much.
Food for your spirit.
Can you take so much.
Check it.
Can you take so much.
Food for your spirit.
Can you take so much.
Cause I've been going down hill.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Cause I've been going down hill.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.

Instead of snapchattin' ladies.
To get a little glimpse.
Should be taking them to the cross.
For their final submit.
Instead of lustin' over this.
I should be working for Him.
Love is sacrifice.
Might as well start of with this.
Call me a Jesus freak.
You can't stop this fire.
The other fires expired.
That's why you retired.
Headed towards dead road.
Reason why you're tired.
No more options.
Fire dies.
Got no more wires.
The truth hit me hard.
Like how the wind blows.
You can't fight the wind.
Gotta accept the flow.
How long will you fight.
For lies doesn't it get old.
Don't get trapped like Lyon.
Scared stones.
Got a little taste of heaven.
Ain't' good enough.
Sin's what you hate.
You love the benefits it comes from.
Heart is so polluted need a new one.
Check it.
Earn the benefits of becoming His son.

Check it.
Can you take so much.
Food for your spirit.
Can you take so much.
Check it.
Can you take so much.
Food for your spirit.
Can you take so much.
Cause I've been going down hill.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Cause I've been going down hill.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
Gotta get back up.
