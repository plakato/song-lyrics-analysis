Sea Ghost Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

I dove into that freezing sea.
With the parasite attached to me.
I had hoped the salt below.
Would divorce what was wed above.

But league after league.
It yet remained.
For the fleshy vessel I.
Kept it sustained.

And so we froze a while surrounded by one big tear.
Which only reminded me of a former home.

But we weren't welcome.
The sea made that clear.
By filling us with saline.
And sailing us blue blue back into.
The atmosphere.

You choked as you surfaced, tangled in seaweed.

But what remained?
Of the driving intent?
That led me to tract such watery depths.
Many things have betrayed me.
Between there and here.
And my memory is so fucking unclear.

Who was I with? What time was it? Where did you go?
