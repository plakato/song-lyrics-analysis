Ain't No Maybe Lyrics
by 3LW.

This ain't no maybe, baby.

Today is my day that I know fo sho.
Gotta speak first, gotta let you know.
In case you're wondering if I'm available.
If you think that I am , I am and if.
Something's on your mind, you should let it off.
I got time, maybe we should talk.
It's no coincidence when you're caught off guard.
Me and you supposed to be baby....

I ain't trippin on your car or where you live.
It don't matter if your broke, we'll be struggling.
What I'm saying is that I will be your baby.
This ain't no maybe.
Ain't tryna get my thoughts all in your way.
I don't even want your Chipers.
You're the one I wanna kick it wit.
This ain't no maybe, is you feeling me.

You'll have to pardon if I come on strong.
It's just that you got everything I want.
It's your character, the way you be.
It's so intriguing to me baby.
I like your braids and your thug appeal.
Keep it real.
How's about me and you on the low, what the deal.
Baby in case you haven't noticed.
Without you boy I'm so hopeless.

I ain't trippin on your car or where you live.
It don't matter if your broke, we'll be struggling.
What I'm saying is that I will be your baby.
This ain't no maybe.
Ain't tryna get my thoughts all in your way.
I don't even want your chipers.
You're the one I wanna kick it wit.
This ain't no maybe, is you feeling me.

You make me weak in the knees.
I can't sleep, I can't eat.
I can't even think baby.
Can't even concentrate.
I can't even think straight.
See you need a lady.
Hey boy I wanna be your lady.
Let me be your baby.
I know that I'm the one for you.
Boy don't you know.

I ain't trippin on your car or where you live.
It don't matter if your broke, we'll be struggling.
What I'm saying is that I will be your baby.
This ain't no maybe.
Ain't tryna get my thoughts all in your way.
I don't even want your Chipers.
You're the one I wanna kick it wit.
This ain't no maybe, is you feeling me.

I wanna be your lady.
No actin shady.
And I put that on everything.
I wanna be your lady.
No actin shady cause I'm your baby.
And I put that on everything, everything.
