1991

1991.
Hey.
It's the trend setter.
Ridin round New England.
Never been better.
Give you all a penned letter.
This my verbal vendetta.
All you niggas ballin, but you prolly get a pass never.
First Letter, last letter, ninth letter, last letter, RAP BETTER!
Y'all stressin. Prolly got ya draws bunched.
I wish you suckers all could get ya jaw punched.
Glasses of the truth?
Invite you to drink a tall one.
Hard to believe they functioning while they on one.
I guess I fear addiction to the lean of the lean.
I'd rather burn the green with my team.
M-C with no trouble man.
The pen I keep.
S-u-double c -- e- double - s you ven aqui.
Cause my patience runnin thin, I'm waiting on the fence.
And shout out to the DJ's who be making records spin.
I'll give you TwentyOne just to take you through the years.
It appears this is old new flavor in ya ears.
You should prolly roll another one.
Make it disappear.
Hell yeah.
I gotta have it.
Hell yeah.
I gotta have it.
Hell yeah.
I gotta have it.
