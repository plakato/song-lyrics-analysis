Inspire a Fire Lyrics
by Wonder Bred.


Dom Cobb: They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now,.
that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, our mind can build almost anything.
Ariadne: Such as?
Dom Cobb: Well, imagine you're designing a building, all right? You.
consciously create each aspect, but sometimes it feels like it's almost.
creating itself, if you know what I mean.
Ariadne: Yeah. Like I'm discovering it.
Dom Cobb: Genuine inspiration, right? Now in a dream, our mind continually.
does this. We creat and percieve our world simultaneoulsy and our mind does.
this so well that we don't even know it's happening. That allows us to get.
right in the middle of that process.
Ariadne: How?
Dom Cobb: By taking over the creative part. Now this is where I need you.

In the morning I'm recording like sway.
Go figure me trying to figure out what to say.
I'm able to in Ableton record with my MPK.
I'll say this much because it's Christmas today.
The sky isn't very grey I'm on my merry way.
Beauty and the Beast used to be a scary play.
How can we perform Alchemy as a chemist.
Like 2Pac you bout to feel the wrath of a menace.
I wrapped up the presents and don't pass up confessions.
I have a suggestion and ask for the blessing.
I'm living in a tesseract 5th dimension.
I wrinkle my time and i mash up my seconds.
As a guest speaker i sit in class for the lessons.
Like Paul Revere i call for all to here this message....
Im a firebrand that's why i brand cows.
Give me liberty, the bell tower sounds.
Or death since I'm free when my body's in the ground.
I am still wealthy even if monetarily if I'm poverty bound.

I truly believe that i am a lion and all.
I have no service but birds I'm trying to call.
Entitled teens beg for things, crying in malls.
I break bad to my lawyer, i am lying to Saul.
We all wanna be Good men, i couch surf upon cushions.
Looking to wander, i push you to ponder.
How you would father, so you don't look at your daughter thinking I've cooked.
up a monster.

I use Paul's laptop to work in Ableton live.
I set no limits so i aim past the sky.
I engage my mind when i take a ride.
I may decide to say a rhyme that will make you say why.
If I'm wasting my time slaving away 9-5.
Then go wait in line for some things to buy.
I encourage the trends to die, so i can represent inside.
Why do they gentrify, brutally honest is where my intentions lie.
Like Gordon coming forward saying what I've said about Dent is a lie.

Could each tree possibly be every person this earth has ever seen?
We can't know the truth about the evil that men do, most definitely.
Like is it true that God can do things like invent a new tree?
Leaps of faith be the only way to reach glory, check your inventory.
Every little bit of my literature and litany, is me giving my life story.
I am perfectly calm dude, but the forecast is stormy.
That's just like your opinion man, even if you mean to scorn me.
I feel like the Lion King yet I'm surely wearing a crown that's thorny.
That's for the one before me.
This is Neolithic, the Oracle told me she saw me before.
Don't let this Red eye train pass, I'm tom hanks hollering all aboard.

Whatever I sample, its all too hot to handle.
I dissipate stress within damsels.
Whats jack and a candlestick without a candle?
I describe inside my mind simply when i ramble.

The rise and fall is epic like that of the Berlin wall.
You hungry cows just in for the green, I am herding you all.

This tale you're listening to is legitimate, it isn't tall.

I'm like Rafiki just seeking to speak with the king.
I ford rivers to Mordor to find the Lord of the Ring.
This isn't a hobbit talking but when i walk i sing.
Playing the harp with heart strings.
Hark the lion king versus shot in the dark, bark, then endangering.
I dine with fine eats at a Chinese restaurant called Ming's.
Before the crack I'm born to rap, let the liberty bell ring.

Crazier than Nicolas cage.
I face the machine with rage.
I speak on street corners, concrete is my stage.
I'mma flee to Indonesia seeking to speak with a sage.

Gourmet food for thought is about to blast off.
Get on this hip hop or listen to Slim and kick rocks in flip flops.
This is not a shot in the dark or a walk in the park.
Im a man ready on his mark to rock steady like Bob.
And drop heavy as Wonder Bred never forget that's who brought.

This to you get intuned it's not on your radio so plug in your iPod.
Im not a rhyme god, but I've got my lines off.
Like Joseph is how my coat is, mad colors.
I think the big government is actually a bad brother.
I'm blessed since I have my mother, and we all are cause we have each other.

Caring is cool, my poetry is revolutionary.
Im scaring a school, the team is on my back and i carry them to.
The promised land, atlas shrugged and gave me you.
The world on my shoulders and i am prepared to share the truth.

Too many lies permeate into innocent minds.
Fight for peace? Who are we to kill our own kind.
Militia don't kill my vibe, i see what i speak is on the rise.
The dawn is so close yet we are in the Dark night.
But it is so important that now is our hardest fight.
