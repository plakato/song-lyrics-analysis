Personal Demons Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

Psychosis must be setting in.
Clouding my perception.
Social interaction.
Null and void.
Contact with reality.
Is something I no longer need.
Now I have insanity on my side.

It is just as I suspect.
I am wired incorrect.
Must just be a defect of my design.
Allow me to elaborate.
On my poor mental state.
I seem to hallucinate from time to time.

I have personal demons.

Answers, answers everywhere, but not the ones I seek.
Now my sanity is leaking through the cracks in the ceiling.
It's just a matter of time 'til I lose my mind.
And start crawling up the walls.

Questions, questions everywhere, but not the ones I pose.
Now my conscience is lying in a state of disrepose.
It's just a matter of days 'til I'm no longer sane.
And start crawling up the walls.

Unusual and bizarre.
I have gone much too far.
Not my fault my thoughts are.
Out of the norm.
I am not right in the head.
Nowhere near a full deck.
Maybe my parade is led.
Slightly off beat.

You might say I'm on the fringe.
Slowly becoming unhinged.
Can't cure me with your syringe.
It's much too late.
Maybe in the scheme of things.
These are just all fever dreams.
They don't make a vaccine.
For what ails me.

I have personal demons.

Answers, answers everywhere, but not the ones I seek.
Now my sanity is leaking through the cracks in the ceiling.
It's just a matter of time 'til I lose my mind.
And start crawling up the walls.

Questions, questions everywhere, but not the ones I pose.
Now my conscience is lying in a state of disrepose.
It's just a matter of days ‘til I'm no longer sane.
And start crawling up the walls.

I have strange thoughts.
Rattling in my brain.
Fighting to get out.
It's hard to keep them contained.

I hear voices.
Screaming inside my head.
I mustn't listen.
I'm sure that they want me dead.

I have personal demons.

Answers, answers everywhere, but not the ones I seek.
Now my sanity is leaking through the cracks in the ceiling.
It's just a matter of time 'til I lose my mind.
And start crawling up the walls.

Questions, questions everywhere, but not the ones I pose.
Now my conscience is lying in a state of disrepose.
It's just a matter of days ‘til I'm no longer sane.
And start crawling up the walls.
