Personal Demons Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

Psychosis must be setting in
Clouding, my perception
Social interaction
Null and void
Contact with reality
Is, something I no longer need
Now. I have insanity on. My side

It is just as I suspect
I am wired incorrect
Must just be a defect of my design
Allow me to elaborate
On my poor mental state
I seem to hallucinate from time to time

I, have personal demons

Answers answers everywhere, but not the ones I seek
Now. My sanity is leaking through the cracks in the ceiling
It's. Just a matter of time'til. I lose my mind
And start crawling up the walls

Questions questions everywhere, but not the ones I pose
Now. My conscience is lying in a state of disrepose
It's, just a matter of days'til, I'm no longer sane
And start crawling up. The walls

Unusual and bizarre
I have gone much too far
Not my fault. My thoughts, are
Out of the norm
I, am not right in the head
Nowhere near a full deck
Maybe. My parade is led
Slightly off, beat

You might say, I'm on the fringe
Slowly becoming unhinged
Can't cure me with your syringe
It's. Much too late
Maybe in the scheme of things
These are just all fever. Dreams
They, don't make a vaccine
For. What ails me

I have personal demons

Answers answers everywhere, but not the ones I seek
Now. My sanity is leaking through the cracks in the ceiling
It's. Just a matter of time'til. I lose my mind
And start crawling up the walls

Questions questions everywhere, but not the ones I pose
Now. My conscience is lying in a state of disrepose
It's just a matter of days. ‘Til, I'm no longer sane
And start crawling up. The walls

I have strange thoughts
Rattling in my brain
Fighting to get out
It's hard to keep them. Contained

I hear voices
Screaming inside my head
I mustn't. Listen
I'M sure that they want me dead

I have personal demons

Answers answers everywhere, but not the ones I seek
Now. My sanity is leaking through the cracks in the ceiling
It's. Just a matter of time'til. I lose my mind
And start crawling up the walls

Questions questions everywhere, but not the ones I pose
Now. My conscience is lying in a state of disrepose
It's just a matter of days. ‘Til, I'm no longer sane
And start crawling up the walls
