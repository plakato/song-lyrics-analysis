Champagne Freestyle Lyrics
by Ty Barz.

Mr. Apollo dat nigga everybody wan na follow 
They, say Barz you the best I just be like. I know, 
I know this. You noticed that these other rappers bogus 
Keep that Magic for the Birds getcha jaw done like Hocus Pocus 
Like hold this holster, like you suppose, ta 
Face, on a wanted poster for all you posers 
Im, in that Rover paint job like Mocha 
And, the kid burn: bread, No toaster 
Barz, no locksmith 
I should be locked with the Locness 
Im a monster best synopsis 
Toxic. When I spit hotter than the tropics 
The topics top pick top it or Ty picks 
I. Let my tape rock till my tape pop 
Put in so much work defeat a boss, then leave him Red Sox, 
That's. Just a nice nigga trait, when your raised in the hood
