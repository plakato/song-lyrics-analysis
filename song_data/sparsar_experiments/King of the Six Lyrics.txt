King of the Six Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


Catching opps, that's the opps?
I woke up feeling like I was 22.
Catch your ass loafing put you on the news.
Bitch we the kings of the six x8.

I woke up feeling like I was NumbaNine.
Rocket launcher on my side get your ass fried.
Smoke a lot of dead people need I stay high.
And what's that pack you smokin' on, this that KI.
On your drive, pop outside, niggas always hide.
We got all our guns out and we fucking slide.
My shorties ball, hoes, they all wanna shoot.
Fuck a loose screw, we.
turnt up for Lil Boo.
I woke up in the morning then I drunk a deuce.
Got a glizzy on me, boy, don't be no fool.
Look at the ass on my bitch.
We spending cash in this bitch.
In traffic we blastin 'em 'n shit.
And we spazz in this shit with them ratchets and shit nigga.

I'm always on these blocks, that ain't nothing new.
I woke up feeling like I was Lil Boo.
Better not try beef with the Six.
We got them glizzies and shit.
Spent the whole thing on my wrist.
I know you see me lil bitch.
Fuck the Jakes CPDK.
Free all our demons and shit.
It's me and Lil Dee on a hit.
We catch you we leaving you bitch.
And RIP my brother L'A.
I know he seeing this shit.
Slide on the opps.
I don't need no drillers it's just me and Breezy that's it.
With the gang.
I'm with the gang.
Shoot these .223's through a nigga face.
Six-O on your ass, you can't lack, goofy.
Better tuck your chain before they snatch, goofy.
