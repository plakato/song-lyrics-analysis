Gone Lyrics
by ViZion.


Pack up your bags, come if you believe.
Get girls, let's breeze, let's surf let's leave.
Been better been worse.
Been love and been hurt.

Tint up, all round, noone's seeing in the ride.
I'm doing what I like, in a cloud, on a height.
Living life, doing right, doing wrong, yea we might.
All I know is when it's over, it will be hell of a life.
Limit is no limit in the sky.
Flip the world upside down so my sunset's rise.
I see birds and planes so I know I must be fly.
When this day is over we'll be living where the stars collide.
And no I never change, stellar like a satellite and blazing like a flame.
Even when they tie me down and shackle me in chains.
I swear I'm gonna break these bonds and fly up and away.
And we never coming down.
Memories in making with our feet up off the ground.
Best of me, is yet to be, within me even found.
So I gotta go, my destiny is somewhere in these clouds.

I'm gone, over and above it.
I'm on, living and I love it.
Im strong, better for my down days.
I was in a dark maze now I'm where the stars blaze.
Gone, over and above it.
So long, living and I love it.
I'm stronger for the days.
Coming from a dark place, now I let 'em star gaze.

Never let 'em bring you down.
Whole world hold on, we've got it within us now.
To do everything, we ever wanted to.
I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it.
Yea I know they wanna know what it is.
Cause I keep 'em guessing like a class full of college kids.
I salute it, got that knowledge up, yea I did.
Now I'm going all in, hustling for everything.
So please never let me slow.
So much that I left behind just to make this future glow.
Running in a race and I'm going in like Usain Bolt.
Full speed off the edge, no bungee rope.
Yea, I know it's going be perfect, living but never on the surface.
Coming up for air and you could see me as I surface.
Biggest wave is coming in and I know I can surf this, peace.

I'm gone, over and above it.
I'm on, living and I love it.
Im strong, better for my down days.
I was in a dark maze now I'm where the stars blaze.
Gone, over and above it.
So long, living and I love it.
I'm stronger for the days.
Coming from a dark place, now I let 'em star gaze.

Over the rainbow and out into space.
Cause we bold and we brave.
And the light that we shine is the light that we chase.
I'm no longer afraid.
Of the dark in the room cause we born to be great.
Make no mistake that I'll do what it takes.
Cause the light that we shine let's the world illuminate.

I'm gone, over and above it.
I'm on, living and I love it.
Im strong, better for my down days.
I was in a dark maze now I'm where the stars blaze.
Gone, over and above it.
So long, living and I love it.
I'm stronger for the days.
Coming from a dark place, now we let 'em star gaze.

We right above it.

I'm stronger for the days.
I'm better for the ways.
Yea it's crazy, AR.
