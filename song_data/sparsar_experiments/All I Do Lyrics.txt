All I Do Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

D-Smoove 
Come on listen up now, 
3rd Storee on the rise come on 
Yab Yum on top come on 
I'm in the studio caked up 
I leave the session when you wake up 
Only rock the beats with the deep cuts 
We all screaming 3rd Storee. What what 
I met shorty on Sunset, 
Bumping, Newark, on the tape deck 
I, got the number you can bet that 
I got three friends. Don'T forget that ya heard me: 
 
Jay-R 
Shorty had a little back caught my eye 
Bounce getting jiggy with her sexy. Thigh 
She blew my mind. She was all so fine 
I think about her. Now, most every night, 
I like the way her style got me hypnotized 
Be, so fly I got ta make her mine, 
 
3rd, Storee 
1-. All I do is 
Think about you. 
How am. I supposed to 
Chill without you, 
 
Jay-R, 
I wan na know what I can do. 
To get me closer to you. 
I wan na know the do's and don't's 
What. Can I do to get you 
 
Lil'Man 
Everyday, I think about it everyday 
If. I could only have you babe, oh yeah, 
 
Lil'Man 
I can't explain what I see in your eyes 
But. I know it comes from deep inside 
And everyday. I wish that I could see 
The girl that always be inside my dreams. Baby
