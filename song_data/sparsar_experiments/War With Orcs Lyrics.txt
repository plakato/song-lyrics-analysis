War With Orcs Lyrics
by 4th Pyramid.

WOOOWEEEE!
They want to know what you gonna do next.
They in the streets yelling Pyramid you hexed.
They want to know what you gonna do next.
They in the streets yelling Pyramid you hexed.

Mind, officially lost got rhymes.
Y'all is pissing me off in my time.
Y'all can't build with the Gods.
Live in a prism of fog what I'm feeling is odd.
Lights, I'm bringing it back.
Get hype, when I sing on a track.
In my life, we spitting them raps.
With my mic music mimicking the night.
Medicine I use it help me living in this life.
Shiver shimmering the fright politicks ain't gonna hold me down.
If you thought so then you don't know me clown.
Feet forced to the ground.
Speaking often in nouns.
In the graveyard coffins astound.
Coughing aloud Teardrops mocking the clouds.
Fear not.
'I know exactly what you've been up to'.

Went to War with Orcs.
That was guarding hell.
If the rap game is smurfs.
Then I'm Gargamel.
My whole style's unpredictable and hard to tell.
'I know exactly what you've been up to'.

I'm spinning hybrid.
Into life kid.
What I live I write shit.
Still spit preciseness.
I'll king your Isis.
Sting your spine with.
My embedded pen.
Seven headed gem.
Go and tell a friend.
Pyramid's prose is prevalent.
Me and these flows is heaven sent.
Seeing these hoes is irrelevant.
And I'm a prayer mantis.
Raps stay semantic.
Writing all day in my cave of granite.
Why come out when the game is rancid.
Stay in my funhouse till my strain's demanded.
Boats to the moon.
Planes to Atlantis.
Joke to the tune.
Yet I stay in the planet.
