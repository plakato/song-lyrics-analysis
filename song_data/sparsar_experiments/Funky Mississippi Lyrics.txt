Funky Mississippi Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Everybody expect me to make a new dance.
I ain't gonna do it this time.
I'm scared to take a chance.

But I'm gonna get serious.
And I ain't gonna give no jive.
I want to know.

I'm the funkiest man alive.
One o'clock in the morning I'm funky.
Two o'clock, etc, etc.
