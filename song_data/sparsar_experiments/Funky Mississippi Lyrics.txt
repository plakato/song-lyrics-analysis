Funky Mississippi Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Everybody expect me to make a new dance
I ain't gon na. Do it this time
I'm scared to take a chance

But, I'm gon na get serious
And. I ain't gon na give no jive
I want to know

I'm the funkiest man alive
One o'clock in the morning, I'm funky
Two o'clock, etc. Etc
