Part of The Game Lyrics
by XamVolo.

Layered Chant.

That's the sound of the man, working at the chain...

Live and die to live and die.

Doomed to roam this cream and brown.
Take his square and knock it down.
It's all part of the game.
These pawns could be queens.
Now who's the fool that said it so.
That all that glitters is not gold.

Girl...
That could be your world on the TV screen.
You could be the one that corners your king.
The finest piece that we've ever seen...

I was born in London town.
Where the man runs from the beast 'fore he hunts it down.
Makes a poor family a feast after lunch in town.
With the sweet folly of peace 'cos they rent the grounds.
It's all part of the contract.
And Mom really wants that.
Now who's the fool that said it so.
That all that glitters can't be yours.

That could be your world on the TV screen.
You could have your hands on all of those things.
In the finest age in technology.
With the world on it's grind, world on it's grind-.

Layered Chant.

Thats the sound of the man, working at the chain...

She wants a Rolly on her wrist with a Phantom Royce.
The only handcuffs that she'd wear by choice.
The rest are part of the game.
The time that she does will look so good in gold.

Who needs the world with the TV screen.
When you look so good in gold.
Who needs the world with the TV screen...

somebody told her that she couldn't get the Rolls at most.
She took the long way home, didn't look at the sky.
Because the moment she ceased to believe in ghosts.
Is the moment she ceased to believe in God.

Girl...
Who needs the world with the TV screen.
When you look so good in gold.
Who needs the world with the TV screen...
