Come With Me Lyrics
by Xandria.

I belong to a world of twilight and regret.
Sing my song to the ones who never hear it.
The spell is cast, time is frozen for eternity.
I know it lasts only till the sun is rising.

Sinful is my heart, my darling.
Let me share with you.

Come with me to a place far away.
Come enter the world in the shadows.

All my scars are painted with the blood that I once have spilled.
My old heart had to see it all to win my freedom.

Sinful is my soul, my darling.
Let me share with you.

Come with me to a place far away.
Come enter the world in the shadows.
See through my eyes and feel what I feel.
Come take my hand and just dare to believe.

Come with me to a place far away.
Come enter my world.
