Anagnorisis Lyrics
by Bodi.


Never let em down? Now how's that.
sound?
Who you gonna hold if you can't see the ground?
How you gonna stand up if you were built to fall?
How you think you're gonna soar, hoping you're not gonna stall?
All alone. Born to roam.
Borders sewn off from each other,.
call it home.
Go and try to mend the sand, but who.
you think will give a damn.
Let the waves break, and.
Let the tide take, you.
Out of the race, erased.
You escape to-.
Night, underneath moon.
Light, you can see whose.
Might's gonna reach to.
Heights you can't leap to.
Fright, that's what keeps you.
Right, where you think you.
Like, but the flight-fight eats you.
alive.
And you can't decide whether you should speak or stand or run.
Or hold your tongue or reach the end,.
defend or lend a hand or gun.
And you've become everything you said you wouldn't.
And you can't hold the world because you never understood it.
Crooked little smile that you aim.
At the man in the mirror framed where you place the blame.
Foolish, little useless, simple-minded you believed.
That you could breath and change the world before it came your time to leave.
And see the hands of fate and stack the deck against it, it's naive.
That you could call a bluff on lady luck with ace inside her sleeve.
Who you think you are, talking to your shadow?
Try to save a world, locked in a civil battle.
Gallows overpopulated, preaching to.
the congregated.
Converted is how sense is made.
Of flags turned to army blankets.
Weightless, cause you can't hold your own.
And soon all you are is a name on a stone.
Cold case close, tagged toes, made.
those choices.

Rattling around inside of your head.
Who you think will care in the end when you've fled?
Less self or selfish, it's high-time.
you learn.
As the flames rage, you'll watch em all burn.
