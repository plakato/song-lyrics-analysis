Bachelor(ette) Lyrics
by Voltaire.

You're a fountain of blood.
In the shape of a girl.
I'm the bird on the brim.
Hypnotized by the whirl.
I drink you- make you feel real.
Wet my beak in your stream.
The game we're playing is life.
Love's a two way dream.

Leave me now - return tonight.
The tide will show you the way.
If you forget my name.
You will go astray.
Like a killer whale.
Trapped in a bay.

You're a path of cinders.
Burning under my feet.
I'm the one who walks you.
You're my one way street.

You're a whispering water.
A secret for me to hear.
I'm the one who grew distant.
When you beckoned me near.

Leave me now - return tonight.
The tide will show you the way.
If you forget my name.
You will go astray.
Like a killer whale.
Trapped in a bay.

You're a tree that grows hearts.
One for each that I take.
I'm the ground that you beat on.
You're the branch that I break.

And life is a necklace of tears.
You undo them with your fear.
And I am a fountain of fears.
You fill me with your tears.

Our love.
Is a big ball of string.
Devil collects it with a grin.
Our love.
