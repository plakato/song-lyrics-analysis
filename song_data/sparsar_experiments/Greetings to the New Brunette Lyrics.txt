Greetings to the New Brunette Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

Shirley,.
it's quite exciting to be sleeping here in this new room.
Shirley, you're my reason to get out of bed before noon.
Shirley, you know when we sat out on the fire escape talking.
Shirley, what did you say about running before we were walking.

Sometimes when we're as close as this.
It's like we're in a dream.
How can you lie there and think of England.
When you don't even know who's in the team.

Shirley, your sexual politics have left me all of a muddle.
Shirley, we are joined in the ideological cuddle.

I'm celebrating my love for you.
With a pint of beer and a new tattoo.
And if you haven't noticed yet.
I'm more impressionable when my cement is wet.

Politics and pregnancy.
Are debated as we empty our glasses.
And how I love those evening classes.

Shirley, you really know how to make a young man angry.
Shirley, can we get through the night without mentioning family.

The people from your church agree.
It's not much of a career.
Trying the handles of parked cars.
Whoops, there goes another year.
Whoops, there goes another pint of beer.

Here we are in our summer years.
Living on ice cream and chocolate kisses.
Would the leaves fall from the trees.
If I was your old man and you were my missus.

Shirley, give my greetings to the new brunette.
