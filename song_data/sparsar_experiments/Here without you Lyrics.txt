Here without you Lyrics
by Vitamin String Quartet.

A hundred days had made me older.
Since the last time that I've saw your pretty face.
A thousand lights had made me colder and I don?t think I can look at this the.
same.
But all the miles had separate.
They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face.
I'm here without you baby.
But your still on my lonely mind.
I think about you baby.
And I dream about you all the time.
I'm here without you baby.
But your still with me in my dreams.
And tonight it's only you and me.
The miles just keep rollin.
As the people either way to say hello.
I've heard this life is overrated.
But I hope that it gets better as we go.
I'm here without you baby.
But your still on my lonely mind.
I think about you baby.
And I dream about you all the time.
I'm here without you baby.
But your still with me in my dreams.
And tonight girl it's only you and me.
Everything I know.
And anywhere I go.
It gets hard but it won't take away my love.
And when the last one falls.
When it's all said and done.
It get hard but it won't take away my love.
I'm here without you baby.
But your still on my lonely mind.
I think about you baby.
And I dream about you all the time.
I'm here without you baby.
But your still with me in my dreams.
And tonight girl it's only you and me.
