Jubert's Path Of Destruction Lyrics
by Sydney.

With the seasons changing ever faster.
Our two hearts still pitter patter.
Can't you feel it?
It beats so hard it breaks your eardrums.

Please just save yourself.
Your friends can't save you.
Now they're coming.
They're coming after me for you.

My face hits the windshield.
There's glass all around.
Get out of the car.
Scott my God what just happened?

Say you're okay.
We faulted the red and we fell so damn hard.
I will be there.

The wrong direction it leads to rejection.
If I leave you here yeah you know ill regret it.
Say you're okay.

You stopped too late and now everything's fading.
Why do I have to?
I know what you want to hear.

Take me home I can't even see straight.
Pick out the glass that's stuck into my face.
I can't go home cause I know it's the wrong place.
It's out of the question but I'll be here.

Say you're okay.
We faulted the red and we fell so damn hard.
I will be there.

The wrong direction it leads to rejection.
If I leave you here yeah you know ill regret it.
Say you're okay.

Lights out and the whole worlds watching.
Keep it on the presets I can't help it.
Let go of all inhibitions let it all sink in, let it all sink in.

We say these things.
But they never really sink in.
The problem is you know but you can't take back what you want'em to know.

You can't take back what you want'em to know.
You can't say that when we're ready to go.
You can't take back what you want'em to know.
You can't say that when we're ready to go.

Say you're okay.
We faulted the red and we fell so damn hard.
I will be there.

The wrong direction it leads to rejection.
If I leave you here yeah you know ill regret it.
Say you're okay.
