Lemme Smang It Lyrics
by Yung Humma.

Mmmmmm, Hmmmmm  Hhmmmmm.

Hey, little lady how you feelin'?
It's Humma-Boo at the crib just chillin'.
Tryin' to figure out what I'm gonna do today.
How about you throw on somethin' sexy and come my way?
I got a treat for you, man you gonna like it.
I hear those giggles: go ahead and get excited.
You say in the bed that your man is a lame guy.
Havin' sex with him is just like watching paint dry.
Daaaayymn, I really hope that that ain't true.
But if it is, here's what I'm gonna do for you:.
And when you get here, I'm not just gonna Bang it.
I'mma smash it too, so let's just say I'm gonna Smang It.

Lemme Smang it girl.

The way I work that kitty gonna make your heart sang.
Now are you ready baby then let's get crazy.
I hope your muscles warmed up, you caaan't be lazy.
This is what I like to call Smash Bang fusion.
Gotta focus, mama don't wanna get a Cooch Contusion.
I like to mix it up, I like to do stuff;.
I like to start slow and then I beat it up.
You should be cautious, don't be scary.
I'ma have you lookin' like a Wild Thornberry.
The locals got you dry.
Well let me be your tourist;.
I'll leave your body feeling like a rainforest.
so let's get it poppin'. Tell me can you hang?
Now lemme smang it, baby: Smash it and Bang.

Flynt Flossy, known across the Nation.
Smash &amp; Bang is my favorite combination.
Kiss you to your toes till you get that sensation.
It's a love scene, baby, with no communication..
Got mine's off, now to the next location.
I need inspiration, your mouth fixation.
Smangin' them drawers is my life's aspiration.
Eff dot Floss loves ladies and relations.
Call me Marathon, my Jimmy run long.
Call me Schwarzenegger, my sex game strong.
I smang it Tarantino, From Dusk till Dawn.
I smang it everywhere from the bed to the lawn.
