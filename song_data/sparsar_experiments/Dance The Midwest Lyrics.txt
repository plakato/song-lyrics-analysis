Dance The Midwest Lyrics
by The Wrens.

I can't believe / we've undone / comes around.
To whatever polish / how i've held my tongue back.
Call me to teams / just a one / making out /.
Make an over daddy / now i'm done / i'm homespun.
Come to that truck given up.
To the growth to the hay to the farm's east edge.
For me it's blessed in status.
That's just because it just marks.
Tired end of the mapway spinning me.
Right your sweet house.
Jane let's dance the midwest.
Lift your blonde summer dress.
Swing me wide through what's left.
