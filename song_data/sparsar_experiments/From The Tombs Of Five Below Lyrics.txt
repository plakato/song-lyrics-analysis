From The Tombs Of Five Below Lyrics
by Unearth.

The whites of their eyes are flush with devils blood.
It was all too visceral to deceive - to lay to waste our own.
No - Nothing can save us - This Pestilence will deliver us to our end.
Our cancers rise- A passage paved - the imminence of wrath.
It was all too visceral to deceive - to lay to waste our own.
No - Nothing can save us –.
This Pestilence will deliver us to our end.
Now haunted by the mark of Death.
From the tombs of five below.
The Gathering of arms has fed and grown the highest flames.
Our cancers rise and call on the Demons of Wrath.
Now you see that see that it was all too visceral to deceive - to lay to waste.
our own.
No - Nothing can save us –.
This Pestilence will deliver us to our end.
We're on the Road to Oblivion.
Where The Huntress knows no bounds.
We're on the Road to Oblivion.
From the Tombs of five below.
We're on the Road to Oblivion.
The whites of our eyes are flush with devils blood.
Eyes flush with Devils Blood.
On the brink of the six end of life.
Eyes flush with Devils Blood.
