Drag Open Lyrics
by Women.

Coming too far.
And dragging vice.
Your lungs expand.
So don't feel blue.
She did out your voice and lips.
You're such a drag.
Open.
Sit on your back.
We'll see this through.
Your chartered trips.
You're smaller than sand.
She did out your voice and lips.
You're such a drag.
Open.
