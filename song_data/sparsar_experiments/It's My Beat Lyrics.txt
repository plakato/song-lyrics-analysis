It's My Beat Lyrics
by Sweet Tee & Jazzy Joyce.

How shall I rock thee?
Let me count the ways.

The bass is thumpin, the party is jumpin.
I got the rhymes to keep your body pumpin.
To keep you rockin, that's what I intend ta.
This ain't number one on the Sweet Tee agenda.
I'm gonna break it down, so you can see.
The skillfull way I recite my poetry.
Quick as a flash, I'll pop upon the scene.
Break out the Casio and the drum machine.
Got to get busy, cause I know I'm down.
As I tap into my instruments this funky sound.
Prone to make your body start to perspire.
As I turn the volume up higher and higher.
Grab my JVC, pop in a cassette.
Have the people stompin to my beat, you bet.
Play it for my friends cause it sounds so neat.
And they ask  It's My Beat.
It's My Beat.
It's my beat.

So take a minute and wipe your sweat.
But don't lose your tissue, cause I'm not done yet.
I'll jump on the stage, the crowd will come swarmin'.
And through the bass bottoms my beat'll come stormin'.
In, like a beast, breakin out of his cage.
Pursuin eardrums with a deadly rage.
Cold kickin ass, a blast from the past.
First in line, all you weak ones are last.
I'm simply novelist to say the least.
And if I want to be conceited, I'll hear myself, chief.
Ace lady rapper, cold queen of hip-hop.
Have the people screamin.
Just gettin busy, I'm tellin you, baby.
Take it as a promise, no ifs, ands, or maybes.
Totally convinced, I wouldn't call it conceit.
But I'm Sweet Tee and it's my beat.

I'm the entrepreneur of the hip-hop decor.
Have you people rampagin and hit the dancefloor.
Freak to my melody, get hip to my beat.
As I display my rhymes so viciously, see.
Eh, I'm on the top, number one, yes uno.
Don't play stupid, cause I know that you know.
So go take the chance cause you don't wanna miss.
Jazzy Joyce on the mix, rock my funky beat, bust this.

My beat is rough, but yet it's so tender.
Do the right thing, party people, surrender.
Go with the flow, cause I want you to know.
That the lady Sweet Tee is runnin this here show.
Ain't nothin to it but to go ahead and do it.
Don't need a pair of sneakers to run right through it.
Situation's stable, no question about it.
Me get rocked by who? I doubt it.
I'm only gonna tell you once, dog on it.
Do yourself a favor and g- g- get on it.
Super high post, I catch the beat with ease.
Demolishin rappers while I'm shootin the breeze.
So be on the look-out, Sweet Tee's comin.
Fast with the rhymes and twice as stunnin.
Make my day and you face defeat.
Cause I'm Sweet Tee and it's my beat.

Due to circumstances you'll have to be aware.
That Sweet Tee and Jazzy Joyce are definitely here.
To stay on the top, right where we belong.
And if you think we can be taken, I'm sorry, you're wrong.
Quite confidentially I'm well aware.
That I'm talkin out my face, but I just don't care.
Cause we're the ultimate, on the top, can't you see.
You better never ever sleep on Jazzy Joyce and Sweet Tee.
Jazzy Joyce  Jazzy Joyce.
Jazzy Joyce.
Cold bloody terrorizin, baby, that you can bet.

Yo, put on your glasses, so that you can see.
That's right, it's all about Jazzy Joyce and Sweet Tee.
Now you know about us, my voice real clear.
Peace out, yo, be easy, Jazzy Joyce, we're outta here.
