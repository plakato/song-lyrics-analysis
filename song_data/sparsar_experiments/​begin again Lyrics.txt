â€‹begin again Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


Begin again
Begin again
Begin again

I've been watching your kindness, keep
A lonely company
Look at the fire and think of me
I've been watching you creep
Around my wandering feet
Trying for years to flee

I need not one thing: more
Oh wrap the ground, around
Your gentle winding mind
Oh guard the pounding sound
Breathe in your fiery. Air
Oh wrap the ground around
Give back an hungrier stare
Oh guard, the pounding sound

You, be the moon, I'll, be the earth
And when we burst
Start over oh darling
Begin, again
Begin, again
Begin, again

My moon, oh my moon
Not, even into
Another eternity
Will, you stop. Your lovely orbiting
I had held it a world away
Until my body'gan to say
