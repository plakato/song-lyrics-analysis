In My Soul Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.

Produced by Chris McClenney.

Something in my mind, got me thinking.
Got my whole world quickly spinning.
Something in my hands got me tapping.
Subconscious beat maker and rapper.
There's something in my lungs keep me breathing.
Hummin' out melodies, forms of speaking.
Music in my soul, music in my heart.
No matter where I go, you can't tear us apart.

Ziyaad Luce≈ç &amp; Chris McClenney.
I said waking up with you.
Yeah.
I said we just tuning up baby.
Jamming out today.
I said we just tuning up baby.
Jamming out today.
Music in my soul.
Throw your hands like you know.
Music in my soul.
Throw your hands like you know.
Music in my soul.
Throw your hands like you know.
Music in my soul.
Throw your hands like you know.

Let's take a walk down memory lane.
And I will show you my idols felt the same.
William Handy, the father of the Blues.
He gave us all the rules to use his tools.
Like my boy, Marvin Gaye, a black genius.
He showed a nation the black sweetness.
Don't forget MJ and the moves he made.
He's still a king till this day.
Music in my soul, no matter where I go.
Music in my soul, no matter where I go.
Music in my soul, no matter where I go.
Music in my soul, and music will never go.
