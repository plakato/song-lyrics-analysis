Crumbs hitting the floor fiends clicking they bic, lighters, 
With Garfield, eyeballs, pulling them all nighters 
Give me. Fifty push ups. Give ya'll a little piece: 
Faggots did a dime niggas too weak 
For, fun shove, a Suzy Q in they face 
Let'em smoke, a rock with cake on they head in the gate. 
He might die with a stem on him. 
Who give a fuck, I'm Larenz, Tate, on'em,

I was about to break his hand until it came back tan 
He dancing around the stove Starks chilling in his rob. 
My hard knock life. I could of wrote that for Hov' 
Shorty give me a ginger ale and dutch masters 
Matter fact hand me the phone, I'm bout to order Casper's 
Fiends at the door, I'm too lazy to let'em in 
Turkey sandwich barbecue chips, ESPN 
Sitting on the couch, I'm just trynna - Do the match

Today was a good day. No one got shot, 
No police or none of that. That'S how it is in our spot. Yeah

Two types of coke we in

Gangstas to the death of it humbling villains, 
A good hand, chemist in twenty minutes, cake up and finish 
This for the hallways. The long days me and my whore bagging up 
Shorty more razors and bring out the four aces 
Sit back laughing, with a stack and a clapper 
She spray up everything we paying Pataki 
Drug house with no work there. The worst fear is never the thirst. Yea 
But set up for to the first of the thirty first disperse yeah

No feds, just Kevin Tighe or west, watching 
Bagging up at the table. While we chit chat 
Past the Phillie wash
