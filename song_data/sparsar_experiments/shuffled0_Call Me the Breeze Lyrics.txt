Call Me the Breeze Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Call me the breeze.
I don't know.
Nobody's hidin' from me.
But I don't love me no one woman.
I keep blowin' down the road.
I ain't got me nobody.
Makes me feel right at home.

And I ain't hidin' from nobody.
Ain't no changes in me.
Well there ain't no change in the weather.

I keep blowin' down the road.
Well I got that green light baby.

I got to keep movin' on.
So I can't stay in Georgia long.
Oooh Mr Breeze.
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches.
Ain't no changes in me.
Well I dig you Georgia peaches.
Well now they call me the breeze.

Well I got that green light baby.

Ain't no change in the weather.
I got to keep movin' on.
Makes me feel right at home.
Well I might go out to California.
Might go down to Georgia.
I don't carry me no load.
Oh, that's the way its supposed to be.
