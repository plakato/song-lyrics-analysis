Emergence Day Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


*Radio broadcast interruption.
*Sounds of planes crashing/explosions.
Holy shit!
We have units on the way now, We're reported a fire on the 78th floor...
We just had a plane crash in the upper floor of the World Trade Center...
We have smoke just coming from the World Trade Center right now from the.
upper floors...
This is mayday mayday! *indistinguishable* Another plane just hit the.
freaking tower K!
