$100 Tip Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

The buggy code of my internal workings.
Keeps synced with my bad timing.
That's flaw.
The dead spot in between our ears keeps spreading.

When we stand up, no one comes to ask.
Why is this backwards?
The alarm doesn't go off.
After you're awake.
And especially that feeling you get.
When you meet someone who looks like you.
That one hundred dollar tip.
In a town or family.
Without enough money to keep itself alive.
