No Master Plan No Master Race Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

MC Serch.
Set to decide, who's on the inside track.
But you slack and so another dive.
And you lounge - but who's shoes would you be in?
Wake up, it's time to respect the Nubian.
Flag of a people, fightin every day.
For their own say, so children can go out to play.
And stray from the tyranny, while blood is drippin B.
I ain't no flapjack, don't bother flippin me.
I stick to this, so say this while you're grazin.
Original man's a black man, said by a caucasian.
Watchin a culture be stolen from Asia.
Whether minor or major, science I swayed y'all.
With lingo, some people don't think so.
When do you stop sayin - that's the way things go?
Time to manifest the quest that's hard to digest.
The companies are frontin Pete, why don't they divest.
And invest in freedom, but they scheme on a brother.
Stealin trunk jewelry that's MILES undercover.
So discover as a people, we have to take our place.
There is no master plan because there is no master race.

No ghetto, no master race...
Let both sides, unite, in peace...

Pete Nice.
Science for seasons, years and days.
A preacher follows his prejudice, the drummer plays.
Off the evils of men, love bones and flesh.
A brother's keeper keeps puttin peace to rest.
Question props and the prophets agreed, ya heed.
Dust to dust, herbs yieldin seeds of.
Creation of cultures to street sound.
You get run around but I run the booty down.
No master plan, the masses all struggle.
Slug movements bungle, our serpent is subtle.
Hatred born in diversity of culture spoke.
Ignorance got the last straw, the camel's broke.
Change up wisdom wise and stick to tools.
One called slavemaster's son by a poor fool.
I ain't the hypocrite fit with the two-face.
There's no master plan, there's no master race.

No ghetto, no master race...
Let both sides, unite, in peace...

MC Serch.
The creators creations are put to side.
You see one wants greed and then slide.
Into that all-about-me frame of mind.
And keep the truth away from the blind.
You gotta find out who is who and who built this place.
I play spy and try to destroy the race.
We go the wrong way, the wrong play master.
The same people that got the +Gas Face+ last year.
Tears shed as another head gets put to bed.
Paradise is a paradox, the devil's ridin sleds.
Over skulls, that dulls all the truth.
It's the reason why we need to raise the roof.
To look to the heavens as the master's one plan.
We stand to help the birth, of just one man.
The master's plan, the master's race shackled to a shelf.
In a book that you need to find for yourself.
I stand accused, but never abuse the Sunday.
Cause when I'm gone I'll only go one way.

No ghetto, no master race...
Let both sides, unite, in peace...

Pete Nice.
I ain't a master, no I'm not superior.
So why you tryin to play one as inferior.
Fears in hearts of the ignorant belligerents.
Ever since those convinced of lost innocence.
Got off the tip slippin sticks and stones.
Homes are broken or fractured like bones.
Who holds your soul as the master your dollar spent.
Evidence of dictators gone hellbent.
In times of old the races vicked power many places.
Seperate races in segregated spaces.
Back in the day you turned your backs on.
Deals in doom, so now the deally lays the cracks on.
Sold more then sold forth from South to North.
Swingin low on supremacy's corpse.
Of course not steppin out of place is in place.
Question those on the question of race.

No ghetto, no master race...
Let both sides, unite, in peace...
Both sides begin anew the quest for peace...

No ghetto, no master race...
Let both sides, unite, in peace...
Both sides begin anew the quest for peace...
Both sides begin anew the quest for peace...
Both sides begin anew the quest for peace...
Both sides begin anew the quest for peace...
