Monster Lyrics
by Two Crown King.

Something to prove. Pacify the monsters from my past.
Nothing to lose, so I ain't never coming back.
Don't be too sad. I do this with a heavy heart for every man.
And please mom and dad â€“ I knew you just wouldn't understand.

Now I'd really rather end it with a stroke of the pen, -.
\- but I'm tired of trying to fix what's broke again.
My new shoes are hardly broken in, -.
\- and this coat don't conceal what it needs to.
Hold your breath. The worst has yet to pass.
Wait for the bomb to blow. The burst to blast.
Stay calm, kid. Never be the first to ask.
I need proof that the road is paved.

Beat black and blue. These bruises just refuse to let it pass.
Not nothing new. My family's familiar with this path.
Don't come alone, unless, yes it's difinity you see -.
Can set you free. You speak you.
Don't get me wrong. --.
I'd really rather end this with a stroke of the pen, -.
\- but up jumped the prophet, and we're at it again.

Even with the pin pulled I keep smiling.
Beautiful business meets front page violence.
Home made handguns for teenage tyrants.
The weak ones speak, and the strong stay silent.
I've never been the one to laugh last.
Trying to fight battles that I've chosen.
Midnight for you means for me it's half passed.
The wind warms up as it blows in.

Hold your breath. The worst has yet to pass.
Although I'm constantly wrong.
Close your eyes. Protect them from the blast.
In case I'm terribly wrong.

Even with the pin pulled I keep smiling.
Beautiful business meets front page violence.
Home made handguns for teenage tyrants.
Even with the pin pulled I keep smiling.

Hold your breath. The worst has yet to pass.
Although I'm constantly wrong.
Close your eyes. Protect them from the blast.
In case I'm terribly wrong.

Hold your breath. The worst has yet to pass.
Although I'm constantly wrong.
Close your eyes. Protect them from the blast.
In case I'm terribly wrong.
