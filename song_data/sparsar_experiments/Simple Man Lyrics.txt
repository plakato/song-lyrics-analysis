Simple Man Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.


Mama told me when I was young.
Come sit beside me, my only son.
And listen closely to what I say.
And if you do this.
It'll help you some sunny day.

Break.
Be a simple man.

Oh, take your time, don't live too fast.
Troubles will come and they will pass.
You'll find a woman, yea, you'll find love.
And don't forget son.
There is someone up above.

And be a simple kind of man.
Oh be something, you love and understand.
Baby be a simple kind of man.
Oh, won't you do this for me son.
If you can.

Forget your lust, for the rich man's gold.
All that you need, is in your soul.
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try.
All that I want for you my son.
Is to be satisfied.

And be a simple kind of man.
Oh be something, you love and understand.
Baby be a simple kind of man.
Oh, won't you do this for me son.
If you can.

Oh yes I will.

Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself.
Follow your heart, lord, and nothing else.
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try.
All that I want for you my son.
Is to be satisfied.

And be a simple kind of man.
Oh be something, you love and understand.
Baby be a simple kind of man.
Oh, won't you do this for me son.
If you can.

Baby be a simple, be a simple man.
Oh be something, you love and understand.
Baby be a simple, kind of man.
