Secret Garden (Jr. Blender Remix) Lyrics
by Sway Clarke II.

Sway Clarke II.
Hey girlfriendâ€¦I know you asked a question.
Like are you the only rose in my garden?
And I know this sounds contemptuous.
And I'm sure it will affect us.
But no, no, no.
Please just beg my pardon, see.

Sway Clarke II.
I got white ones, purple ones, red ones.
Baby I got love to give, baby I got love to give.
I got black ones, yellow ones, brown ones.
Baby I got love to give, baby I got love to give.

Sway Clarke II.
Hey best friend, I know you got some questions.
Like when I start to grow my secret garden.
Didn't happen on a weekend, but over different seasons.
Toronto had me cold.
I was young with no control.

Sway Clarke II.
My heart was looking for.
White ones, purple ones, red ones.
Baby I got love to give, baby I got love to give.
I got black ones, yellow ones, brown ones.
Baby I got love to give, baby I got love to give.

See, I bought a dozen roses for my dozen roses.
Don't want no one stinging nettle while they're brushing shoulders.
See, my addiction stems from trusting the moment.
So I'll always have a hose to water this rose with.
And I've been like that from a teeny toddler.
She loves me or she loves me not.
Feel the games suck and she suck me off.
All break-ups were a massive loss.
So we made up, smashing pots.
In the garden by the candy shop.
With my black with that ?
And my white girl with that black bum.

Sway Clarke II &amp; Wretch 32.
