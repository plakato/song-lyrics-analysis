Try Sleeping With A Brokenheart Freestyle Lyrics
by Rwhisky Champ.

Then she start getting crying,start getting weeping,tell me your problems,even.
though i can't solve them,i would listen,i would make it up to you girl,i will.
try to ease off the stress that you having,give you foot massage,give you.
everything,go for manicure,go for a pedicure,baby girl for you broken my.
heart,broken my soul,now i'm feelin' like a mirror,but a broken mirror.
