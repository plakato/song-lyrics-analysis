Rainbow Factory Lyrics
by WoodenToaster.

WoodenToaster.

Now a rainbow's tale isn't quite as nice.
As the story we knew of sugar and spice.
But a rainbow's easy once you get to know it.
With the help of the magic of the Pegasus Device.

Let's delve deeper into rainbow philosophy.
Far beyond that of Cloudsdale's mythology.
It's easy to misjudge that floating city.
With it's alluring decor and social psychology.
But with all great things comes a great responsibility.
That of Cloudsdale's being weather stability.
How, you ask, are they up to the task.
To which the answer is in a simple facility.

In the rainbow factory.
Where your fears and horrors come true.
In the rainbow factory.
Where not a single soul gets through.
In the rainbow factory.
Where your fears and horrors come true.

In the rainbow factory.
Where your fears and horrors come true.
In the rainbow factory.
Where not a single soul gets through.
In the rainbow factory.
Where your fears and horrors come true.
