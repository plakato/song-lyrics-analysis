F.N.T.W. Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


I dont feel no type of way, no emotion from the king.
Said its just me and team we dont feel no type of way.
No emotions from the king.
Sit back and watch me do my thing.
I been working, working like i got something to lose.
Well in fact thats cause i do.
They say im rapping, rapping like i got something to prove.
That im better that you.

Ok now the only thing i know is great.
Only thing that im not is fake.
Only language i speak is truth.
So you and i can't conversate.
And i know you haters got a lot to say.
I dont give you my time of day.
Said no to you and they yes to me.
When i come around she accomadate.
They all doing what i say.
I bring the table to my plate.
Im trying to get this money like 5 ways.
So paydays is just fridays.
Cause im always in tip-top shape.
Im a giant i skyscrape.
So small talk me no hable.
Because everything i do grande.
And they waitin, waitin, waitin, waitin, waitin.
For me to fall boy i hope you got some patience.
Cause i worked to get where i am dog.
It ain't take that long to get hot.
And my ? told me im only seconds from pulling into your spot.
Look i started with nothing but change in my pockets.
What more can i say now my name is the topic.
But all they can say is how much i accomplished.
Take that to the bank which your two cents to deposit.
Ain't your time in the night night players.
I'm an all star go and get night-light player.
Promise you don't really want it this is fight night player.
I ain't never been a looser whats your life like player.
Im ill.

Ok i hop off the plane.
I made it up to the city.
I got some sleep in my eyes.
And my necks feeling like jelly.
I call up mikey and shawn.
They pick me up and they tell me.
I got a session with tarik.
I said yo cool thats the relly.
Boy i been getting it in.
Trying to make it colossal.
My niggas bad to the bone.
Man you can tell by the fossil.
Im thinking bout getting money.
So im steadily grinding.
I got bitches on top of bitches like my name frankie lymon.
I make my way to this paper.
I be hungry fo sho.
And ive been making these moves.
I place my order to go.
Man every night i been dreamin im on a mountain of dough.
Already knew i was trippin smoked a mountain of dro.
Na na na i dont fuck with none of yall.
Like waterboy i wanna ball.
Greedy boy i want it all.
She heard em all.
She wanna brawl.
Bars homie my lifes facin.
Do it big like chubby-chasers.
Patriotic like george mason.
One hand on my heart never on the Jameson.
Chilling in my ride.
Hard to see whats inside.
It ain't no devil in my eyes.
Just that purp cause im still high.
Man i love it and i fucking mean it.
You can tell by my demeanor.
I dont need your two cents.
Save that weak shit for the meter.
Man my shit ain't never watered.
Workin hard like south the border.
Like two cents on that recorder.
Its four on top till i get deported.
Yeah.
Yeah its four on top till i get deported.
Flow the killa im dressed in black.
Its a funeral what we just recorded.

Tarik &amp; Tyler Thomas.
Im just important, this is just a portion.
I ? a coffin, and thats just for caution.
Ill stuff your coffins ?
? they discuss me often.
Boy my name got rang out.
Fresh kicks and my jeans low.
Chained up on that young nigga.
Got horse power like django.
Said it won't be long till that range rover.
Still cashing out when that bank close.
No ice but my name glows.
And im still rocking these same clothes.
And i change clothes like jay ho.
Tech longer than eight hoes.
Hit once and she say so.
And she come back for like 8 more.
God damn.
