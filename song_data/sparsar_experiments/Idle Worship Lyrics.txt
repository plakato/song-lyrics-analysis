Idle Worship Lyrics
by QuayChronicles.


And God said....
Let there be paper..
Heh... preach!

You're all mine.
One by one.
This golden crown....
Idle worship.
It'll strike you out or weigh ya down.
Idle worship--- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Blood on my new crown, that's hard work.
Open wounds healin' soon, my scars hurt.
Now angel wings seem to sing for a king.
But they swing towards a thing I could never bring.
Bless me with hydraulics and digi dashes.
As long as they knew that they could claim my ashes.
Explains why I thirst for Chevys and buggattis.
When I die crucify me on that Maserati.
Lawd forgive flaws long as I leave in awe.
All jaws, and that require me to floss.
You shall bleed for my diamonds.
To the point your heartbeat's silence.
As you die to knees.
You realize you don't worship me.
It's the shine that made you mine.
Give me you're soul while I recline.

What got me feelin' like, I'm the world's Kryptonite.
Red and blue jewels in the booth: Superman, right?
I got see-through vision.
Cause I see that my karats get all to listen.
Rubies in a new Jesus piece.
Call it Revelation, it'll bring you peace.
Put the best vixen in my reach.
Say she love me; well, practice what ya preach!
Ask forgiveness. Shit, pray for me.
Poetry at its finest.
Hand stitched--- I slaved for the designers.
Only believe in the physical.
let's see who bleed a lil'.
Modern day divinity.
Praise my holy trinity.

All my Porsches: oh, shit is gorgeous.
Die from my idle worship.
Praise my fortress; it's gorgeous.
Die from my idle worship.
All the marble foreign; ain't it gorgeous?
Die from my idle worship.
Dont forget that my vixen gorgeous.
Die from my idle worship.
