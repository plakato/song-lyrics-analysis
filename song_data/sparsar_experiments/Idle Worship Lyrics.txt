Idle Worship Lyrics
by QuayChronicles.


And God said: ... 
Let there be paper. 
Heh ... preach 
, 
You're, all mine 
One by one 
This golden crown; ... 
Idle, worship, 
It'll, strike you out or weigh ya down: 
Idle worship, -- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
 
Blood. On my new crown. That'S hard work, 
Open wounds healin' soon my scars hurt 
Now angel wings seem to sing for a king 
But. They swing towards a thing. I could never bring 
Bless me with hydraulics and digi dashes 
As long as they knew that they could claim my ashes 
Explains. Why? I thirst for Chevys and buggattis 
When. I die crucify me on that Maserati 
Lawd forgive flaws long as I leave in awe 
All jaws and that require me to floss. 
You shall bleed for my diamonds 
To the point, your heartbeat's silence. 
As, you die to knees, 
You realize you don't worship me 
It's the shine that made you mine, 
Give me you're soul. While I recline 
 
What got me feelin', like I'm, the world's Kryptonite 
Red and blue jewels in the booth Superman right 
I got see-through vision. 
Cause. I see that my karats get all to listen 
Rubies in a new Jesus piece. 
Call it Revelation it'll bring you peace 
Put, the best vixen in my reach, 
Say. She love me
