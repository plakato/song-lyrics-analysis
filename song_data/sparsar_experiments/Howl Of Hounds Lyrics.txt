Howl Of Hounds Lyrics
by Vogue.

Running through the glass in my melting aviary.
Swimming through the stars in my sunken observatory.
Every single man that ever walked this earth had a tale to tell.
And please don't take me as a joke, my friend....
Oh my desperation.
My ruthless end.

Girl... my crystalline towers wilting and black.
Black and wilting.
How I loved to feed the birds.
Oh the ravens every Sunday.

And boy, these roads once paved in gold.
Glazed over with the features of mangled doves.

Blizzard came, the parrots froze and stiffened into glass.
When the firestorm blazed, feathers dripped down and melted to the ground.
When the blizzard came, the parrots froze and stiffened into glass.
When the firestorm blazed feathers, dripped down and melted to the ground.

When the wild did blow the colors dripped dropped from the clocks.
Across the ruins of this palace.
When the roses did grow, they blossomed in the black and white.
When the wild did blow the colors dripped dropped from the clocks.
Across the ruins of this palace.
When the roses did grow, they blossomed in the black and white.

So I'll run down to a garden of dull roses smiling at the storm like hungry.
vampires.
And I'll lay down in the dirt and try to die like I should while this paradise.
crumbles around me.

Well oh, everything is dark all around.
The stars do froth and scream their pleas in foreign tongues.
And these eyes close and wait for mercy.
And then the constellations stop breathing.
And the pulse of the planets stop pumping.

This sky may rot off it's rusty bones.
But I'll live to walk another century.
Alone.

Alone. Alone. Alone. Alone.
Alone. Alone. Alone. Alone.
