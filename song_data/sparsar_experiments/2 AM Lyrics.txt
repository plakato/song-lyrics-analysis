2 AM Lyrics
by Tyga.


It's 2 AM in the mornin.
Pressin my alarm again.
Stressin over my mom and friends.
Sometimes, I wish I was in a coma.

Damn! Wakin up to the cold wind.
Sometimes, I wish I was a kid again.
Sometimes, I don't even wanna remember it.
Cause one time I remembered what I couldn't forget.
Damn! My stepdad beatin me again.
For a bad grade, he must of had A's.
The way he was hurtin me in a bad way.
My mom hearin the scream but just turned away.
What the fuck, are you people crazy?
I was only a baby, five months when they gave me.
To my grandma, who was racist.
But I ain't give a fuck, I just faced it.
Like mace to the police, I was danger.
Feelin like I'm in a manger.
Baby Jesus, save me from the anger.
She's tryin to get me, into this closet I vanished quickly.
Fuck that, I took 50.
From her purse bag, told her Don't miss me.
I ain't comin back, catch me on another path.
I need a bubble bath.
Someone, take me in the plastic basket.
Sittin on bubble wrap, I'm abandoned.
I need a new home, that isn't damaged.
A family whom care, to be parents.
Errant, my life on the mic.
Might wasn't raised too right, so I.
Had to decide to turn on the light.
Do somethin right, before I'm layin with the mice.
Rotten alone on my neighbor's stolen bike.
Tryin to think what my afterlife, gon' look like.
It gotta look right... it gotta look right....

Back to my bad life.
Another day in the fast life got me feelin like I'm on the crack pipe.
No lie, just the thought.
Of me gettin that type of high, but I'm in the dark.
Where the shadows, follow, your every walk.
And as I move, I'm feelin like a shopping cart.
Gimme this, gimme that son.
What'chu mean - ain't you supposed to be my mom?
Why don't you ask God, I worked hard for these two dimes.
I care what it's worth - just the fact that it's mine.
Check your purse, don't you got.
My life savings that you've been savin from birth?
Oh - I forgot you spent that.
On your own gift wrap - I ain't get shit last Christmas.
But a hug and a family wishlist for next year and shit.
Huh! 'Round next year and shit.
I'm gonna be on shit you can't even pronounce, in English.
I got anger.
That's why I paint these songs, visually painting.
It's awful ain't it? A little  in.
But hopefully, time is the pain.
Cause as of now, I just wanna run away... run away....
