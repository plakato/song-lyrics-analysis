Be Chrool To Your Scuel Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Be cruel to your school.
Cause you may never get another.
Be cruel to your school.
In the name of rock and roll.
Be cruel to your school.
Just like a sister or a brother.
Be cruel to your school.
In the name of rock and roll.

Well I don't think i'll make it through another day.
It's eight o'clock and all ain't well.
My brain hurts so much it's startin' to decay.
And I'm livin' in my private hell.
Didn't somebody tell me this would be so great.
Be the best thing I ever had?
How come they never told me 'bout the word exaggerate?
How'd somethin' so good get so bad?
Cause hey, I gotta know!
Am I slow?
Where do I go from here?
Do abc's.
And 123's.
Mean that much to me, that much to me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

Be cruel to your school.
Cause you may never get another.
Be cruel to your school.
In the name of rock and roll.
Be cruel to your school.
Just like a sister or a brother.
Be cruel to your school.
In the name of rock and roll.

Sing it Alice!

Alice Cooper:.

I see them walkin' 'round like the livin' dead.
Ain't they got nothin' between their ears.
How come they don't seem to hear a single word I say?
They ain't the only ones who're bored to tears.
Now there must be a better way to educate.
Cause this way ain't workin' like it should.
Can't they just invent a pill or frozen concentrate.
That makes you smarter and taste, mmm, so good.
Cause hey I gotta know!
What I'll have to show!
When I hi-hi-ho it from here!
Will I be in pain?
Or will I have a brain?
Or will I go insane, I've gone insay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ane?!

Cause hey i gotta know.
What I'll have to show.
When I hi-hi-ho it from here.
Do abc's and 123's.
Mean that much to me.
That much to me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me!

Be cruel to your school.
Cause you may never get another.
Be cruel to your school.
In the name of rock and roll.
Be cruel to your school.
Just like a sister or a brother.
Be cruel to your school.
In the name of rock and roll.

Be cruel to your school.
Cause you may never get another.
Be cruel to your school.
In the name of rock and roll.
Be cruel to your school.
Just like a sister or a brother.
Be cruel to your school.
In the name of rock and roll.
All right.
