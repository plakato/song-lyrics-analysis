World Go Crazy Lyrics
by Two-9.

Produced By Backpack.

Deep down all I ever wanted was some money with my partners.
And a blacked out 'rari and a crib for my mama.
Now a nigga goin' get it either way it go.
No switching, mathematician, motherfucka' no problem.
Keep a bunch of loud weed nigga, ay.
Bunch of nines round me nigga, ay.
If you with your people start jumping on shit.
Start a fucking moshpit or a movement if you need to.
One, two, three, nigga go crazy.
Hit the blunt so hard did a full 180.
Just for the record can't nann' nigga pay me.
Lean got the car creeping,.
driving Ms Daisy.
Pull up to the money like fuck you pay me.
Kill a nigga nowadays, could die young anyway like Tray.

Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.

I strapped the porch with my pistol and my partners homie.
Been fucking your bitch, ?
Don't you ever hit me less you got a problem.
Been sleeping so plush on this Murakami.
Mastermind of my psyche, signed a deal, I'm 'luminati.
Took my poppa's life, it still haunt me.
Day to day when I be drinking sloppy.
Popping pills, I'm just a fucking zombie.
I don't really think they like me mommy.
Mac-11 or they call me Johnny.
Always making money, I'm in love with counting.
And her pussy wet, it's like a fucking fountain.
Money counter, money counter.
Stack it up just like a mountain.
I got dogs you can't be around.
Percocet is kicking in, I fell down.

I said I talk tough, cause I been.
in a house.
Where the guns came out and they look in the couch.
To find work like the unemployed.
Had my mama face down, white by.
the toys.
Told her give up the stash, she ain't have a choice.
So she point out the stash, I ain't have a voice.
Only two, what's a youngin to do?
These facts, I'm just speaking the truth, living the proof.
Hop off the stoop and I got to get it.
The game is survive and I'm the fuckin' fittest.
Middle finger to the five, Imma leave emlivid.
And if a nigga got a ride Imma fucking get it.
Fuck 12, jump bail, fuck a.
sentence.
They say we living in hell so why are we dependent on a motherfucker just like.
me.
They scared of revolt but it just might be, said it just might be.
Ay, see a nigga like me.
Uh, I'm prepared for the beef.
Uh, like a butcher and a cooker we can ride in the street, we can ride in the.
street.
Fuck a college degree.
Cause I learned from the streets.
Two-9 till it kill me.
I know the rest goin' agree.

Said this leather jacket got a ball in it.
Swear this booth I'm in, it got a stall in it.
Your bitch bad and we all hit it.
Yeah nigga we all hit it.
Roll up a blunt, hit it once and I'm stuck.
Where I come from you're only safe with a gun.
Hear them boys talking but they ain't saying none.
New bitch with me, ain't no telling where she from.
The niggas that I'm with get their rep on.
Why you snorting that shit, that dope stepped on.
Tryna figure out nigga why we slept on.
And if you talking wrong nigga, get stepped on.

Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.

Bitch I go crazy.
So crazy, go crazy, I'm crazy, go apeshit.
No we don't take sips, we face it.
And no bitch I don't want no chaser.
Furthermore I would never chase her in my fit.
Very limited Brick, did the regimen.
Counting dividends, bitch it's intricate, all your bitches basic.
Got your old girl and you need to replace her.
In the club and I dab it out.
then I came in the lobby and I run around.
Used to hate me but they feel it now.
I just live life, I don't plan it out.
Young motherfuckers got banana rounds, hammer time.
Hating motherfuckers need to free me.
With my curly haired bitch in the teepee.
Said fuck school, got my GED.
Cause ain't nothing you can motherfucking teach me.

Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.
Whole world go crazy.
