Enjoy the Silence Lyrics
by Swift.

Words like violence, break the silence.
Come crashing in, into my little world.

Painful to me, pierce right through me.
Can't you understand, oh my little girl.

All i ever wanted, all i ever needed.
Is here in my arms. words are very.
Unnecessary, they can only do harm.

Vows are spoken, to be broken. feelings.
Are intense, words are trivial, pleasures.
Remain, so does the pain. words are.
Meaningless, and forgettable.

All i ever wanted, all i ever needed.
Is here in my arms. words are very.
Unnecessary, they can only do harm.

Enjoy the silence.
