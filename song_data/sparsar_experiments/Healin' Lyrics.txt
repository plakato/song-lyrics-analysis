Healin' Lyrics
by Virtue.


Is it somebody on a corner.
Or someone on a subway.
Or a baby with a baby.
Selling her body for money?

I know that you've seen them.
A relative or a good friend.
Childhood dreams been shattered.
Thinkin' that life don't matter.

When your heart's been wounded.
Tell me who can you turn to?
Do you try to improve it.
Or accept what you're goin' through?

Tell me what were you thinkin'.
Tell me what you've become;.
When you feel yourself sinkin'.
And you know that you need some....

tell me what's goin' on.
Look at the world today.
I know we need some.....

all of these broken hearts.
People torn apart.
I know they're lookin' for....

searchin' for love's embrace.
In the wrong place.
I know they need....

But it's somethin' that only He provides.

It might hit you when you're sleepin'.
Or when you're lookin' in the mirror.
It's an overwhelming feelin'.
That you need Him nearer.

And I know that you need Him.
Look at your situation.
Take His hand and follow.
Have no hesitation.
