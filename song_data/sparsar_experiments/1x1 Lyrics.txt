1x1 Lyrics

1X1 
 
Teenagers being wild 
You better go check on your child. 
Shit is so crazy. 
I'M a hero in my hometown, baby 
The soldiers keep marching 
Revolution, they scream revolution, 
Evolution, never stops. 
The mob keeps running running towards the cops 
Release. The hounds 
Dog eat dog. Until the beach drowns, 
 
Left left left right, left 
The ants go marching one by one: Hoorah Hoorah, 
, 
I drink a fifth of vodka kill a copper 
Never, stop fuck. It find a pill to pop 
She poke on some pass. She can puff. 
She gets stuffed like Build-a-bear workshop 
First off light. A stick cuz you sparking hot 
Couldn't get in the club started twerking in the parking lot, 
Polka dot skirt you only sorta hot flirt with 
Coca-Cola iceberg tip sober die, first
