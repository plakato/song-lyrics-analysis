1x1 Lyrics
by Antonym.

1x1.

Teenagers being wild.
You better go check on your child.
Shit is so crazy.
I'm a hero in my hometown baby.
The soldiers keep marching.
Revolution they scream revolution.
Evolution never stops.
The mob keeps running, running towards the cops.
Release the hounds.
Dog eat dog until the beach drowns.

Left, left, left, right, left.
The ants go marching one by one Hoorah, Hoorah.

I drink a fifth of vodka, kill a copper.
Never stop fuck it find a pill to pop.
She poke on some pass she can puff.
She gets stuffed like Build-a-bear workshop.
First off, light a stick cuz you sparking hot.
Couldn't get in the club started twerking in the parking lot.
Polka dot skirt you only sorta hot flirt with.
Coca-Cola, iceberg tip sober die first.
