Post Life Lyrics
by Wolverine.

My life is born in pain.
Pain weaves fragile threads into dreams.
Skies that are annihilated by.
The infinity of the galaxy.

Infinity, man's unsolved riddle in eternity.
But the fairytale of our life.
That became reality.
Will never be destroyed.

Our hands tied together.
For a harsh life.
When we met on a cold winter's night.
Where only stars witnessed our happiness.

Lay three red roses on my grave.
They are for you once you follow me.
Then I will wait by the gate.
Which I was denied in my youth.
The roses are three words.
I love you.
