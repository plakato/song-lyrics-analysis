Could've Been You Lyrics
by 3LW.

Don't even try to step to me now.
When I was feel'n you, you gave me thumbs down.
You had your other woman.
You said that I was tripp'n.
But now you see me with them.
And now you see who's tripp'n - What.
You know what I'm talkin' about so.
Stick your tongue back in your mouth and go.
You can't come back in my house.
And no, don't try to step to me when you see me out.

It could've been you.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.

It could've been you.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.
It could of been you.

So how are your boys now.
When it was me and you that was all you was about.
When I needed you, you had things to do.
But that Ishh is cool, cause the jokes on you now.
There's nothing you could say to me so go.
You thought that you could play wit me, oh no.
Somebody is just checkin for me and so.
You ain't nothing but some suckers to me.

It could've been you.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.

It could've been you.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.

It could've been you.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.

It could of been you.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.
It could of been you.

Break It Down.
Oh oh oh.
Say oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh-.

La La La La La La La.
Could've been you.
Could've been you.
La La La La La La La.
Could've been you.
The one that I was givin' my love to.

La La La La La La La.
Could've been you.
La La La La La La La.
Could've been you.
La La La La La La La.
Could've been you.
La La La La La La La.
Could've been you.
La La La La La La La.
Could've been you.
La La La La La La La.
Could've been you.

It could've been you.
La La La La La La La.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
La La La La La La La.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.
It could of been you.
La La La La La La La.

It could've been you.
La La La La La La La.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
La La La La La La La.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.
It could of been you.

It could've been you.
The one that I was givin' my love to.
Back then you knew I was into you.
And now you can't believe that I'm over you.
Goodbye to you.
It could of been you.
