Schizophrenic Break Lyrics
by Tyler Luke.


I look into the sky, see her beautiful eyes.
See her addictive smile, see all of my lies.
See all of my faults, look past my disguise.
And see all of my demise in the same exact sky.
Walk by a church, seeing a sermon in prayer.
Corinthians fills his hands, do I belong there?
I don't belong there, I don't belong anywhere.
I may belong on tracks, on top of another snare.
I get dizzy thinking about her, we'd be perfect together.
Whenever I'm with her, I feel like the world is out to get her.
She's running so I chase after her, it's what I must do.
I know I wasn't perfect, but this love must be true.
She prays but doesn't know who's listening above.
We sing all the songs we don't know the meaning of.
I want her to see the butterflies flying in my chest.
Migraines in my mind and my heart in cardiac arrest.
She's always on my mind, she's one of a kind.
She's who I want by my side until the day I die.
The clock is ticking down and I'm counting every sand.
You have the whole world in you hands.
I have the whole world in my hands.
