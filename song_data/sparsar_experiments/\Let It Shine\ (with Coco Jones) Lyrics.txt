\Let It Shine\ (with Coco Jones) Lyrics
by Tyler James Williams.

Oh yeah 4x.

It's been a long road but we're finally here.
And the view from the top so beautifully clear.
We can see for forever not a cloud in the sky.
Picture perfect weather everyday of our lives.

Just imagine if everything you wanted came true.
Well it happened to me so it can happen to you.
We're on a journey of truth and belief is the key.
So open up your heart and let your life free.

Oh.
And I feel like I'm glowing.
And I like where I'm going.
Tonight, I'm showing up to shine.

This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

Front to back we're packing, stomping.
Clapping, laughing, singing, dancing.
Passion ever lasting.
When I'm rapping to the track and.
Asking everyone to put your hands up.
Stand up.
Roxanne come take my hand.
And make the congregation rock.

Celebrating and it feels so good.
If I could thank everybody here I would.
I feel like I'm finally free and I.
Yeah I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to fly.

Yeah, oh.
And I feel like I'm glowing.
And I like where I'm going.
Tonight, I'm showing up to shine.

This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

You know it wants to come out.
Don't hide your shine, y'all.
Now put your hands in sky.
Cause your light is your love.

Oh yeah 4x.

This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
Let it shine, let it shine.
Let it shine, let it shine.
Let it shine, let it shine, shine.
