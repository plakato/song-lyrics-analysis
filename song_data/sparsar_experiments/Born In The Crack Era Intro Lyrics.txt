Born In The Crack Era Intro Lyrics
by Yung Joey.


Born in the crack era, 
My pops was a crack deala' 
Malcolm sold his people hope 
All. He sold to'em was dope 
From, where the team we made it rain butter 
They on cream. With that rope, 
Lies told on a good man 
In my hood. He was the pope 
 
Yeah. Here you take this bag of brown sugar 
Bang it in your motherfucking drown. Nigga 
Some people like to hear bass other's like the feeling 
Better get used to me. Cause you'll be coming back to visit 
Some rich four dead on the floor. Patients sedated 
 falling out of his drawers, he impatiently waited 
Never was a fan of serving 
But. A hustler in third person got ta, go see my man 
 
When. You hear talk of the southside. You hear talk of the team 
Niggas respect, but a lot of niggas fear, 
Dumb, motherfuckers, I'mma break it down. Quick 
R.I.P. got killed over a bitch 
As, a youth. All I ever did was sell packs, 
And, um rap broke into my heart when they killed Stacks 
Brothers in the hood was fifty snitched on 
I ain't believe that I think he just looked up to the team 
Back. Then I was a snotty nose 
Running around. In my Adidas exposed to the pies, like domino's 
Garbage bags full of money, I thought it was trash, 
No dollar bills. In them rubber bands, you do the math 
Papa used to hide it in the attic 
And stashed. The work in the mattress cause auntie was an addict 
And. When Christmas came nana just wanted a new TV 
And where the money came from it, never mattered.
