Born In The Crack Era Intro Lyrics
by Yung Joey.


Born in the crack era.
My pops was a crack deala'.
Malcolm sold his people hope.
All he sold to 'em was dope.
From where the team, we made it rain butter.
They on cream with that rope.
Lies told on a good man.
In my hood he was the pope.

Yeah, here you take this bag of brown sugar.
Bang it in your motherfucking ? , drown nigga.
Some people like to hear bass, other's like the feeling.
Better get used to me cause you'll be coming back to visit.
Some rich four dead on the floor, patients sedated.
? falling out of his drawers, he impatiently waited.
Never was a fan of serving ?
But a hustler in third person, gotta go see my man.

When you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team.
Niggas respect ? but a lot of niggas fear ?
Dumb motherfuckers I'mma break it down quick.
R.I.P. ? , got killed over a bitch.
As a youth, all I ever did was sell packs.
And um, rap broke into my heart when they killed Stacks.
Brothers in the hood was fifty ? snitched on ?
I ain't believe that, I think he just looked up to the team.
Back then I was a snotty nose.
Running around in my Adidas, exposed to the pies like domino's.
Garbage bags full of money, I thought it was trash.
No dollar bills in them rubber bands, you do the math.
Papa used to hide it in the attic.
And stashed the work in the mattress cause auntie was an addict.
And when Christmas came, nana just wanted a new TV.
And where the money came from, it never mattered.
