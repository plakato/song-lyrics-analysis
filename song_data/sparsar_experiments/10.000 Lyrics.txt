10.000 Lyrics
by Vivid.

Does it really matter.
Or do I ring a bell.
Does it feel right to ignore me?
I cannot assure you that I4d be doing well.
I4m waiting here till the end.
It4s like 10000 angels.
10000 words.
And 10000 demons that soon will be heard.
I4m not alone I4m just here by myself.
Waiting like books on a shelf.
Do I really bore you?
All the stupid things I4d said.
Tell me, I4m losing my patience.
I can4t reassure you that I4ll be doing well.
I4m waiting here till the end.
It4s like 10000 angels.
10000 words.
And 10000 demons that soon will be heard.
I4m not alone I4m just here by myself.
Waiting like books on a shelf.
Oh, I never meant to do you wrong.
So tell me where do you belong.
It4s like 10000 angels.
10000 words.
And 10000 demons that soon will be heard.
I4m not alone I4m just here for myself.
Waiting like a book on a shelf.
