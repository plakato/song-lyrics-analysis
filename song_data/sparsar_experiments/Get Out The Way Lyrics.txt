Get Out The Way Lyrics
by WordPlay T.JAY.


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Born immaculate like midichlorians.
It's been a while since I put my foot in Delorean.
I use the force to stretch the sound like an accordion.
And all the while I am senior valedictorian.
Tryna juggle the struggle, while staying optimistic, flow apocalyptic.
Slow the clock is ticking, I can stop resistance with all the good I'm giving.
And I'm here to tell the people what they need to know.
I put the groove into the record, let the needle go.

If I can see it then I let it go.
The life I'm living, nothing shorter than a miracle.
I see the light, my past was darker than a spiritual.
And if you tell me no that means that I ain't hearing you.
I see it coming get out the way.
I see it coming get out the way.
I see it coming get out the way.
And if you on that negative then get out my face.

Soon I'm about to hit you on your tv screens.
Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon to hit the scene.
Round it up with Cobert and the rest, this is dope in the flesh.
I've been pushing every day homie, dare me to flex.
I got muscle like a mollusk, watch me reign and no umbrellas.
On The Map and they can't tell us that we never hit the top.
No bejewel and no embellish, I'm a pickle like in relish.
It don't matter if we sell it we gone dish it til we drop.
Not a flop until we say it, that success is overrated.
I am never green with envy, so I'll never get it jaded.
See me talking with Charlamange, next to Angela Yee.

2010, MTV, Sway just got me on my feet.
Now the rest is up to me, to get it popping in the streets.
1 by 1 collectiong fans just to give them all the heat.
Until I'm living on the beach, hit the sand like a sheik.

Check I'm going to war, in a galaxy far, far away.
I'm a star it's not fair to make me stay.
I can never be replaced, not my soul or my essence.
Quick to drop a message like a 1000 UPS's.
I'm the bottom to the top, from the biz and the session.
Will he ever make it up? I can answer. Ain't no question.
Cause my fans stick beside, they stay keeping me alive.
Humble, ain't no lying, I don't even need the pride.
Get my stride, chew it up, and I'm always on the cusp.
Now I'm tipping off the edge, then I drop and I feel the rush.
I can't help it, when I felt it, I just let the spirit go.
I can't focus on their movement and keep hoping mine's will grow.
All of this awakens, I can bring about new hope.
Use my talent I've been given just to try and help you cope.
And my dream to heal the world I can never let it go.
And the truth I'm terrified, I ain't scared to let you know.
