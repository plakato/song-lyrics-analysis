Let Me Go Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

Just leave me to my phone.
I don't mind being alone.
Seeds are being sown.
Yea I'm plotting on the throne.
I don't need your flirty attitude to feel worthy.
Just please let me be, lord have mercy!
I'm not falling for your tricks like the other guys.
Cause you seem to think that any mark will wanna spread your thighs.
That stuck-up schtick will always hold you back.
But you're the kinda girl that complains when no one's got your back.
Nah, I'm not impressed by your looks.

Your beauty's only skin deep.
So when a real man comes, don't be flipping out when he looks like you're a.
piece of meat.
And hell yea I got a fear of ya.
For all that time you spend in the mirror I think you need to look in the.
mirror.
And leave me be.

Let me go.
And just leave me be.
Just let me go.

My family says to let you go.
I can't leave you, you've been there, helped me grow.
Back from second grade up to the present day.
You taught me how to be my own, and help me cope.
Taught me to be ruthless, taught me to be honest.
I used to think it fruitless, but now to be honest.
I think I've got a shot at you, I can't pass it up.
Cause guys like myself always get want we want.

A mother figure's what you used to be.
But now I've grown, I think you're getting used to me.
My skills have sharpened up, we're different than we used to be.
And you're still the best match for me, truthfully.

And if I can't have you....
Just let me go.
