Gray Goose Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

Written by Leadbelly.

Well, las' Monday mornin', Lawd, Lawd, Lawd.
Well, las' Monday mornin', Lawd, Lawd, Lawd.

My daddy went a-huntin'.
Well, he carried along his zulu1.
Well, along come a grey goose.
Well, he throwed it to his shoulder.
An' he ram his hammer' way back.

Well, he pulled on de trigger.
Well, down he come a-windin'.
He was six weeks a-fallin'.
He was six weeks a-findin'.
An' he put him on de wagon.
An'he taken him to de white house.

He was six weeks a-pickin'.
Lordy, your wife an'my wife.
Oh, they give a feather pickin'.
An' they put him on to parboil2.
He was six months a-parboil'.
An' they put him on de table.

Now, de fork couldn' stick him.
An' de knife couldn't cut him.
An' they throwed him in de hog-pen.
An' he broke de ol'sow's jawbone.

An' they taken him to de sawmill.
An' he broke de saw's teeth out.
An' de las' time I seed him.
Well, he's flyin' across de ocean.
Wid a long string o' goslin's.
An' they all goin': quank quink-quank.
