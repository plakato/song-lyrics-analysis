Well las' Monday mornin' Lawd Lawd Lawd 
Well las' Monday mornin' Lawd Lawd, Lawd, 
 
My daddy went a-huntin' 
Well, he carried along his zulu1 
Well along come a grey goose 
Well. He throwed it to his shoulder 
An'. He ram his hammer' way back. 
 
Well he pulled on de trigger 
Well down. He come a-windin'. 
He was six weeks. A-Fallin' 
He was six weeks, a-findin' 
An'. He put him on de wagon 
An'he taken him to de white house. 
 
He was six weeks: a-pickin' 
Lordy your wife, an'my wife 
Oh. They give a feather pickin' 
An'. They put him on to parboil2. 
He was six months, a-parboil' 
An'. They put him on de table 
 
Now de fork. Couldn', stick him 
An' de knife couldn't cut him 
An', they throwed him in de hog-pen 
An'. He broke de ol'sow's jawbone 
 
An'. They taken him to de sawmill 
An'. He broke de saw's teeth out 
An' de las' time. I seed him. 
Well he's flyin' across de ocean 
Wid, a long string o' goslin's 
An'. They all goin' quank quink-quank
