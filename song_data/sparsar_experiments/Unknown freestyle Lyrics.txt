Unknown freestyle Lyrics
by Unknown.

I stepped in the game i blew up quick like land mines.
Every shot that i bust at niggas i land mines.
I own acres now all this land mines.
I copped both rovers the range and the land mines.
Niggas schemin' on me got the kid light on ice.
That why i sticked to my burner like white on rice.
Im like death.
Cause nobody alive gonna take me.
I'mma do me till the FBI gon' chase me.
Fiens be on the block looking funny and shaky.
I'mma take a trip to where ever my money can take me.
And im trigga happy waiting for a nigga to front.
I need to clap something i ain't shoot a nigga in months.
There ain't nothing you can tell me to help you clown.
Im bout to cock the hammer and nail you down.
And i got over a hundred weapons in my gun collection.
Niggas call me when they want protection.
But everyday i gotta blaze something.
Cause niggas in the hood stay fronting.
Chill dubs you ain't got to say nothing.
Why you mad for.
Mad cause my chain flooded.
Or because i walk the streets with it like it ain't nothing.
I fuck bitches and give it to em how they want it.
Turn em over and throw away up in they stomach.
And when im finshed i pass em off to my eight cousin.
Every ho i boned i got em on tape fucking.
Walk in the stage spot spend about 800.
Walk in the liquor store henny or it ain't nothing blud they shake me.They.
dont wanna hate me. Just cuz im horny.
