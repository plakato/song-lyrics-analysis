Get Away Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Sometimes you get away huh, uh-huh.
We up in this bitch, my nigga Head.
Yung Ro, Rizzo dig these blues.

Yung Ro.
I can write forever bout my pain, till my pen run to ink about it.
I'm a sinner dear Lord, if I ain't doing it I'm thinking bout it.
Surrounded by killers, voulters and devious guys.
So I spend most of my time, looking in my baby's eyes.
Searching for a longer hobby, cause these drugs ain't no doing it.
Use to have a grasp on reality, now these drugs done ruined it.
I can't a-fford a loss, I'm paranoid and strapped.
Bad blood with my connects, got me watching my back.
And I know I'm doing wrong, so I'm destined to be punished.
This mob life got me stressing, to my people one hundred.
I can't see it another way, to survive in these streets.
Searching for answers looking for love, and praying for peeps.
I gotta , because I'm dying at home.
High in the zone, just me and my thoughts crying alone.
Thinking , naw I can't I wish I could.
Everybody up to no good, nobody's real in the hood.
I gotta , and find another place to rest at.
A strong foundation, somewhere I can make a nest at.
, and the answer is no.
Nigga nobody with nothing, I got nowhere to go.
I gotta , dear Father show me a path.
Because this road I made myself, I'm garunteed to crash.
My nigga , X-O is all I need.
Taking flight with my oranges, while puffing on weed.
Trying to , still trying to get out that do'.
But turning the knob the wrong way, and I don't even much know.
, man I wish I could answer that.
I got problems, and the back of the book ain't where the answers at.
I'm trying to  got physical, spiritual and mental pain.
Trying to get away, but it's hard when your enemy's your brain.
, my nigga I gotta get it.
And I expect a small plate, and on top of that I gotta split it.
Gotta , get away to get me some cash.
I need it fast I gotta mash, praying hope it last.
, I'm just trying to keep my head up.
And a pistol from my head, but a young nigga fed up.

, from all this pressure and pain.
Dear Lord show me a way, for me to smile again.
, got me searching for that light.
Grinding working after night, got me hurting it ain't right.

Yung Ro.
I gotta , but that ain't the main issue.
It's easy to run, my question's where I'm gon get to.
, too many questions I can't make out.
Now I'm trying to escape, from what I though was an escape route.
, I tried running tried walking.
Use to stay to myself, this year I even tried talking.
Asking , and in return I got nothing naw.
Someone answered, but never understood the question how to.
, they say I'm crazy on some mo' shit.
I talk to God a lot, I'm one deep on some Ro shit.
, g'eah whatever that is.
Don't know why I remember how, but I'm stuck with what it did.
, so nigga what it do.
Peep my mind, ninety percent of my thoughts is fuck you.
So , back-back move from round me.
I ain't friendly dude, Ro don't speak kindly.
, matter fact far away.
And you can take it from this song, or realize the hard way.
, I ain't asking no mo'.
I'm blasting a fo', and that's for anyone who pass through that do'.
, kick rocks bitch beat it.
The offer was thoughtful, but your presence isn't needed.
, nigga leave me alone.
Cause I don't need you coming around, just to leave me alone.
, I'm alright by myself.
I fight by myself, alone sleep at night by myself.
So , get the fuck away from me.
I'm a nobody nigga, and I ride one deep.

Just let it run I'm cool.
You know, I use to be just like you, you.
So far innocence, love, passion.
And a need for serenity, preaching for a change.
Until things change, like some'ing else got into me.
Like when I gained something, I lose something.
Something so precious, so essential.
A foundation a base, started in my heart.
And spread it to my mental, and from that.
Led to my situation, or should I say situations that I'm in.
Addicted to pain, drama, dope, temporary pleasure.
A living hell, drowning in sin.
This fast life ain't for me, but I never accomplished nothing.
From crying, but it's so hard to fake a smile on the outside.
When on the inside, you really dying.
Ain't no escaping this life, and honestly.
I couldn't picture life, without this.
This pain shit, me without pain is like a scientist without his question.
What if, but what if I did grow up like you.
Across that other side of the fence, where the grass is green.
And life is more predictable, and the unfolded mathematics.
Actually make sense, maybe I could have been something worth speaking of.
If I only had a chance to, or maybe I did.
And just was a kid, unable to see so I just ran to.
An easy way out, a shortcut, a quick route.
Running for that oasis, and realized.
I was actually moving backwards, further into that drought.
Man, ha that made nothing but excuses what I think.
Life is cursing me, like God like.
I deserve more Father please mercy me.
Naw, I need to take care of bidness.
Quit letting temptation win, and the Devil use me as his puppet.
I hear him laughing, while I'm walking on crutches.
Man corrupts, everything he touches.
Got me scared to drop a seed, knowing that I'm destined to be punished.
Question is, will God punish me.
Or will it come along, with the birth of my child.
From a cursed stomach, hmm man I don't know.
All I know is I'm tired, and I think I'm at the end of this road.
And the question we all ask, what happens after this.
Nobody knows.
