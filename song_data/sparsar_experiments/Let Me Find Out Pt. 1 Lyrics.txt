Let Me Find Out Pt. 1 Lyrics
by 5th Ward Weebie.

Girl you know I love ya and I'm there for ya.
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya.
Girl you know I love ya and I'm there for ya.
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya.

Girl you know I even watch your kids for ya.
I got a new purse and a new wig for ya.
Girl you know I love ya, I go hard for ya.
I even hustled up a food stamp card for ya.

I said bitch, don't think you're all that.
I could hit ya from the back for some Wing Shack.
I said bitch, don't think you're all that.
I could hit ya from the back for some Wing Shack.

I said let me find out you trying to all sadiddy.
Let me find out you wearing bootleg titties.
Let me find out you got that pussy on the loose.
Let me find out that nigga got you with a Boost.
Let me find out you still rocking flip phones.
Let me find out that bitch ain't even much on.
Let me find out that Gucci purse not real.
Let me find out you got that internet deal.
Let me find out a nigga brung you on Maury.
Let me find out them children ain't for me.
Let me find out you acting funny with them stamps.
Let me find out you twerking while you got cramps.
Let me find out you wearing Spanks to hide your gut.
Let me find out your stomach bigger than your butt.
Let me find out them booty pants underneath.
Let me find out that ain't your real booty meat.
Let me find out your old man selling bricks.
Let me find out your old man turned snitch.
Let me find out your old man wear sandals.
Let me find out he watch the Lifetime Channel.
Let me find out you got 7, 8 children.
Let me find out you riding along with no insurance.
Let me find out this nigga trying to buy the bar.
Let me find out they about to repossess his car.
Let me find out your best friend took your man.
Let me find out they posting pics on Instagram.
Let me find out you wear that corner store jewelry.
Let me find out you got them diamonds that's blurry.
Let me find out you ain't got money for the rent.
Let me find out you spent that money on that bitch.
Let me find out you out here stunting like you got it.
Let me find out you ain't got 20 in your pocket.
Let me find out you putting rims on a rental.
Let me find out you got a fan in the window.
Let me find out you fucking with that other nigga.
Let me find out that nigga fucking with a nigga.
Let me find out you don't like my song.
Let me find out you don't want to see me on.

Let me find out.

Girl you know I love ya and I'm there for ya.
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya.
Girl you know I love ya and I'm there for ya.
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya.

I said bitch, don't think you're all that.
I could hit ya from the back for some Wing Shack.
I said bitch, don't think you're all that.
I could hit ya from the back for some Wing Shack.

Your baby mama in the club, you mad.
She bending over, letting people Instagram that ass.
Your baby mama in the club, you mad.
She wore them little bitty shorts and Instagram that ass.

Your baby mama in the club right there.
Don't want to pop it on her head while she holding a chair.
Your baby mama in the club right there.
Don't want to stop it on her head while she holding a chair.

Let me find out your baby mama is a groupie.
Let me find out she got that botox booty.
Let me find out that pig lip on sale.
Let me find out you put a nigga in jail.
Let me find out your baby daddy on the run.
Let me find out you took the charge for the gun.
Let me find out you in the mall wearing rollers.
Let me find out you got that Rent-a-Center sofa.
Let me find out you all in other peoples' business.
Let me find out this last month you got evicted.
Let me find out you was a hater on the slick.
Let me find out you won't see a nigga rich.
Let me find out you wasn't using no protection.
Let me find out you went and got a stripper pregnant.

Let me find out.

Girl you know I love ya and I'm there for ya.
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya.
Girl you know I love ya and I'm there for ya.
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya.

I said bitch, don't think you're all that.
I could hit ya from the back for some Wing Shack.
I said bitch, don't think you're all that.
I could hit ya from the back for some Wing Shack.

I said bitch, you know what it do.
I could hit it from the back for some Manchu.
I said bitch, you know what it do.
I could hit it from the back for some Manchu.
