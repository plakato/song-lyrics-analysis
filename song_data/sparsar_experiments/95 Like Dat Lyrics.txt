95 Like Dat Lyrics
by Tyga.

95 like that, like that.
95 like that, like that.
Ninety-five…

95 stylin', straight shots, gold.
medallion.
Put your number on this paper promise I'mma dial it.
Cute college chick, daddy was a doctor.
Word through the grape vine she.
datin' a rapper.
Entertainer, Athelete she never after.
So I entertain her late night with laughter.
High, ten after midnight, it's bedtime.
You could say I stole her heart.
I just call it bedtime.
No rush, just relax your mind.
You are now listenin' to sounds of a better rhyme.
Benz and driver, mosh pit in the lobby.
Girls so horny, that's my type of.
party.
No ties, mob shit, suits and ties.
Crap table, Vegas, vampire nights.
I'd marry you tonight just to say we did it right.
Waking up with regrets, roll over, she be like:.

“Why you never call me back?”.
Sometimes it just be like that.
Can't promise the world.
But I can promise you half of that.
Sometimes it just be like that.
All the rumors you heard.
I ain't got no time for that.
Shit, I ain't got no time for that.
And you ain't gotta cry, dry your eyes.
We gon' get through that.
Trust, we gon' get through that.
95 like that.

Reservations, call, reserve a table.
Alligator, snake skin, Purple Label.
Polyester, black berretta, who do it better?
For my niggas caged up, writin' them letters.
Lower level, reportin' live, Channel 11.
No emergency, but I'm in a 9-11.
Falsetto, girl scream, a rare fellow.
Pull up to the scene bumpin' only instrumentals.
And you know it.
Times flies when you fly in first class all the time.
And you know it.
No time for the games, dollar signs on my mind.
And you know it.
Eye for an eye and killa just tryin' to stay alive.
And you know it.
Gotta learn to live or regret, I regret some times, she like:.

“Why you never call me back?”.
Sometimes it just be like that.
Can't promise the world.
But I can promise you half of that.
Sometimes it just be like that.
All the rumors you heard.
I ain't got no time for that.
Shit, I ain't got no time for that.
And you ain't gotta cry, dry your eyes.
We gon' get through that.
Trust, we gon' get through that.

95 like that.
95 like that.
95 like that.
95 like that.

Litigations, black faces, lawyers, brief cases.
Agents top notch, paid investigations.
Fire Dorf Todd, block shots, Anthony Davis.
Raww the greatest, acres, no neighbors.
Die so many times, hope we do better next time.
Think about it, dog, next time you drop a dime.
Better ride, said she'd rather fly.
Always asking me the same thing all the time.

“Why you never call me back?”.
Sometimes it just be like that.
Can't promise the world.
But I can promise you half of that.
Sometimes it just be like that.
All the rumors you heard.
I ain't got no time for that.
Shit, I ain't got no time for that.
And you ain't gotta cry, dry your eyes.
We gon' get through that.
Trust, we gon' get through that.
95 like that.
