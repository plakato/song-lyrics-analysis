95 Like Dat Lyrics
by Tyga.

95, like that, like that 
95, like that, like that 
Ninety-five… 
 
95 stylin' straight shots, gold
medallion 
Put, your number on this paper promise I'mma dial it 
Cute college. Chick daddy was a doctor 
Word through the grape vine she
datin', a rapper 
Entertainer Athelete. She never after 
So. I entertain her late night with laughter 
High ten after midnight, it's bedtime, 
You could say I stole her heart 
I just call it bedtime, 
No rush, just relax your mind. 
You are now listenin' to sounds of a better rhyme 
Benz and driver mosh pit in the lobby. 
Girls so horny, that's my type of
party 
No ties. Mob shit suits and ties. 
Crap table Vegas, vampire nights. 
I'D marry you tonight just to say we did it right. 
Waking up with regrets, roll over she be like 
 
“Why. You never call me back ” 
Sometimes. It just be like that. 
Can'T promise the world 
But. I can promise you half of that 
Sometimes. It just be like that. 
All, the rumors you heard, 
I ain't got no time for that 
Shit. I ain't got no time for that. 
And! You ain't got ta cry dry, your eyes, 
We gon', get through that 
Trust. We gon' get through that 
95, like that 
 
Reservations call reserve a table: 
Alligator snake skin Purple Label, 
Polyester black berretta, who do it better 
For. My niggas caged up writin' them letters, 
Lower level, reportin' live Channel 11 
No emergency, but I'm in a 9-11 
Falsetto girl scream a rare fellow 
Pull up to the scene, bumpin' only instrumentals 
And. You know it 
Times flies when you fly in first class, all the time. 
And, you know it 
No time for the games dollar signs on my mind, 
And. You know it 
Eye for an eye and killa just tryin' to stay alive. 
And, you know it. 
 Got ta, learn to live or regret. I regret some times she like 
 
“Why. You never call me back ” 
Sometimes. It just be like that. 
Can'T promise the world 
But. I can promise you half of that 
Sometimes. It just be like that. 
All, the rumors you heard, 
I ain't got no time for that 
Shit. I ain't got no time for that. 
And. You ain't got ta cry dry, your eyes, 
We gon', get through that 
Trust. We gon' get through that. 
 
95, like that 
95, like that 
95, like that 
95, like that 
 
Litigations black faces lawyers, brief cases, 
Agents top notch paid investigations, 
Fire, Dorf, Todd block shots, Anthony Davis, 
Raww, the greatest acres, no neighbors 
Die, so many times hope we do better next time. 
Think about it dog next time you drop a dime 
Better ride, said she'd rather fly 
Always asking me the same thing all the time: 
 
“Why, you never call me back ” 
Sometimes. It just be like that. 
Can'T promise the world 
But. I can promise you half of that 
Sometimes. It just be like that. 
All, the rumors you heard, 
I ain't got no time for that 
Shit. I ain't got no time for that. 
And! You ain't got ta cry dry, your eyes, 
We gon', get through that 
Trust. We gon' get through that 
95, like that
