Let's Submerge Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

It's dark and eerie.
And it's really late.
Come on kids don't hesitate.
We're going down to the underground.
We're going down we're going down.
To the underground.
Dagger glares from Richard Hell.
The hades ladies are dressed.
to kill.
Tension heightening heating frightening.
Thunder rolls as fast as lightening.
If you've got the urge.
The subterranean is a bottomless pit.
Come on let's submerge.
The vinyl vultures are after it.
Moulten lava sulphur vapours.
Smoulder on to obligerate us.
If you've got the urge.
Come on let's submerge.
