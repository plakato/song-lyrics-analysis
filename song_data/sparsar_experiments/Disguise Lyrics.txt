Disguise Lyrics
by Vision.

When you look inside 
What, is it that you find 
Images of someone else, 
Just open up your mind, 
Embrace the one you hide 
Read, deep within yourself 
How. Can you expect me to believe 
The role you play when others look your way, 
YOUR WAY, 
Step back and just let go 
Of all the truths. You think you know 
Tell me. What it is you see 
How. Could you ever deny 
All the pain you feel inside 
Is this really what you want to be 
How? Can you expect me to believe 
The role you play when others look your way 
Did? You really think that I'd never see, 
The real side. You hide everyday 
You. Wear a thin disguise 
Inside, you agonize 
It comes as no suprise, You've been dehumanized 
Step back and just let go 
Of all the truths. You think you know 
Tell me what it is you see 
How. Could you ever deny 
All the pain you feel inside 
How? Can you expect me to believe 
The role you play when others look your way 
Did, you really think I'd never see, 
The real side. You hide every day-EVERY, DAY
