Disguise Lyrics
by Vision.

When you look inside.
What is it that you find?
Images of someone else.
Just open up your mind.
Embrace the one you hide.
Read deep within yourself.
How can you expect me to believe.
The role you play when others look your way.
YOUR WAY.
Step back and just let go.
Of all the truths you think you know.
Tell me what it is you see.
How could you ever deny.
All the pain you feel inside.
Is this really what you want to be?
How can you expect me to believe.
The role you play when others look your way.
Did you really think that I'd never see.
The real side you hide everyday.
You wear a thin disguise.
Inside you agonize.
It comes as no suprise You've been dehumanized.
Step back and just let go.
Of all the truths you think you know.
Tell me what it is you see.
How could you ever deny.
All the pain you feel inside.
How can you expect me to believe.
The role you play when others look your way.
Did you really think I'd never see.
The real side you hide every day-EVERY DAY.
