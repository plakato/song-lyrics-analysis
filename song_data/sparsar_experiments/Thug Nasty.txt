Thug Nasty
by Zoltan Nebula.

You can't fuck with this gangsta shit.
You can't fuck with this gangsta shit.
I smash you in your fuckin' lips.
For trying to test my gangsta-ness.

I'm a mutha fuckin' hardcore thug.
I will leave blood on your rug.
Then get yo bitch to give me a tug.
While I'm chillin' with yo moms in your tub.

Bubble baths, make her laugh.
Her pussy wet like clothes in gym class.
I hustle every day so I got lots of cash.
Might as well call me fat stacks.

Ugh, ya you know what I mean.
Ya I know you wanna live this dream.
Fuckin' bitches and gettin' lots of cream.
Until you get shot and start to scream.

I got tons of goons that'll shoot ya.
Leave ya in the water like a beluga.
Got a lama in the trunk, boy I'll shoot ya.
My hollow points will go right through ya.

Got a bitch to change my music, auto tune.
Got a bitch to sweep my floors, auto broom.
She give me house keys, auto room.
She give me utensils, auto spoon.

They say I ain't nothin', tell em watch me.
Throw me a Rolex, homie, watch me.
My click dangerous like some Nazis.
I say thank you in Italian, Grazie.

I'm the best rapper on this earth.
I'm not fake, I'm a fuckin' ice burg.
Cold as hell, with a golden snail.
Tell yo bitch to come right hurr.

Bullet in yo mouth call it fillin' nillas.
You a scab, I'm peelin' nillas.
I'm hard as fuck, no feelin' nillas.

Now some bars about all my bling.
Jewelz on my neck and a pinky ring.
So much ice, I'm always freezing.
You lames think of Asians when you hear Cha Ching.

Money money money money money.
Money money, guess what, more money.
Call me Hitman cause I got bloody money.
Bees in the trap, call it honey money.

Drive a gun shaped car call it pistol whip.
Got a rocket in my pocket call it missile tip.
You a female dog, better listen bitch!!
I told you you can't fuck with my gangsta-ness.
