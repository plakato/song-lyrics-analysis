Ask Me Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

In the middle of her shame  .
Nobody's naming names  .
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  .
She's coming to life again  .
  .
Now she's looking in the mirror at a lovely woman face  .
Still she crawls up in her bed acting quiet as a mouse  .
Yeah, ask me how I know  .
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heaven  .
Mercy in the middle  .
Where did He go in the middle of her shame  .
No more frightened little girl, like she's gone without a trace  .
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heavens  .
Deep inside she's listening for a creaking in the house  .
  .
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the heavens  .
Still she leaves the light burning in the hall  .
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heavens.
He's in the middle of her pain  .
  .
So ask me how I know  .
  .
Ask me  .
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the heaven  .
.
It's hard to sleep at all  .
I see no mercy and no one down here's naming names  .
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  .
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heavens  .
  .
There's a God up in the heavens  .
  .
There's a peace she's found  .
  .
  .
She said His mercy is bringing her life again  .
She said his mercy is bringing her life again  .
Maybe she'll find a way through these awful years to disappear  .
  .
Ask me  .
She takes another bath and she sprays her momma's perfume  .
Mercy brings life  .
  .
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the heaven  .
  .
Ask me how I know, yeah  .
  .
To try to wipe away the scent he left behind  .
  .
I see her as a little girl hiding in her room  .
Ask me how I know  .
He's in the middle  .
You see she's his little rag, nothing more than just a waif  .
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the heavens  .
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heaven  .
But noone's left to harm her, she's finally safe and sound  .
  .
And he's mopping up his need, she is tired and afraid  .
But it haunts her mind  .
  .
