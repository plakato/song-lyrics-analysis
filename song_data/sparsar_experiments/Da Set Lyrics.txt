Da Set Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.

= Woman's line.

For all the fellas on the set who claim they have that funk in they trunk.
Put this in your deck and see if you can make them speakers.

So let's head down the avenue.
And before you leave drop the top A-come on!
Jay got the ride with the bowling-ball bang.
2500 dollars a rock! Aw, lookin' good now!
On the set it be Benz's, Beamers.
A whole lotta guys with loot Check-check-check-check it out!
Cause nothin' better than spendin' cash.
And catchin' girls in them dukes True dat, true dat, true dat!
But one thing about the set, baby.
You know it's gon' be hype Uh! Uh!
It be plenty of food and plenty of fun.
From afternoon till late at night! Uhh!

Jumped in my ride, headed for the set.
You know the 'ave, where all the girls sweat.
Hit the switch, turn my CD on.
Toni Braxton; another sad love song.
Right out my garage.
With my Rolex chain on, cause yo, it's time to flauge.
But before I hit the scene.
I go to Johnny for shinin' so I can get my car cleaned.
And got a wash with the hurry-up.
Paid the man, and put a lil' somethin' in the tip-cup.
Then off goes my pager -.
It's one of my boys! Oh yeah, what a life-saver!
But then it started goin' off again.
I hope it's my boy, but nope, it's my girlfirend.
But I ain't gon' call her back.
Cause she'll start to trip when I tell her where I'm headed at.
And I came faster than a whirl.
A whole strip of cars and fly big-booty girls.
Oh yeah, you can bet.
That ya' boy ain't gon' miss the set!

Nightfall begin to slumber.
Saw this real fly girl, so I gave the nymp' my beeper number.
And the ol' girl was talkin' right.

Then a Bronco rolled by.
And then, everybody on the set - {DO THE BUTTERFLY!!!}.
And  for a minute.
It was the place to be, and you can best believe I was in it.
But it was time to hit the freeway.
Called up B, and Daddy Black on the 3-way.
To find out where the haps at.
They said at the old club where we used to play craps at.
True, that's how the day went.
A whole lot of fun, and not one life spent.
Just chillin' with the crew.
On a deep part of the avenue!
