Sleep In the Heat Lyrics
by Pup.

I was feeling a little bizarre
The day that I buried my family car
In, the scrapmetal wrecking yard

And. I'Ve said so many goodbyes
In, the 25 years that I've been alive
And. I don't know why this one was so hard

And everytime. When I back to my apartment
All, I wan na do is get stoned
And, I'm sick and tired of blacking out on my carpet
And waking up. All on my own
SO. I BROUGHT YOU HOME

You started falling apart
6 months after you moved in
And. I shoulda known from the start
That. Things would be different

It's, not something that I can fix
If. I could do anything. You KNOW I WOULD
If this fucking vacation would come to an end
Maybe, then you'd be normal. Again

Last week, when I went back to my apartment
You were lookin' so stoned
The day after Christmas, you acted so different
You just WANTED TO BE ON YOUR OWN
So. I bought you. Medicine went to the vet and
Cashed all of my savings and loans
But. It was too late.. You were letting go, ... 

Woah, oh oh

And. Nothing, I say, will make it ok

You're wasting away. And nothing. I do is gon na save you
I'm trying my best, but you can't even
Look at me or talk to me or tell me what's happening to you

Yesterday. I went back to my apartment
To see how you've been holding up
You hadn't been eating. I thought you were sleeping, but ... 
YOU'RE NOT WAKING. Up
I want you to know. Thay I'd spend every bit of my
Pitiful savings and loans. Just to see you again

But. I know I won't
