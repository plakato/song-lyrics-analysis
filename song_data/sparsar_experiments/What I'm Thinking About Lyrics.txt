What I'm Thinking About Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Those eyes keep talking, across this table.
And my mind gets walking, watching the way you go.
The band just got started, we could sing along.
But the truth is my heart's in the seat of that car halfway home.

If you're thinking bout what I'm thinking bout.
We could leave right now, put the tip on the time and go.
Keys cross our front porch, knock down our front door.
Can't wait anymore, so let me know.
If you're thinking about, thinking about.
Thinking about what I'm thinking about?

You've got a green light, you're up to no good.
That dress hugging so tight, it's hard to focus on anything.
Or anything but you and me, baby.

If you're thinking bout what I'm thinking bout.
We could leave right now, put the tip on the time and go.
Keys cross our front porch, knock down our front door.
Can't wait anymore, so let me know.
If you're thinking about, thinking about.
Thinking about what I'm thinking about?

I think I know what you need.
I think you want to get as close as you can get to me.

If you're thinking bout what I'm thinking bout.
We could leave right now, put the tip on the time and go.
Keys cross our front porch, knock down our front door.
Can't wait anymore, so let me know.
If you're thinking about, thinking about.
Thinking about what I'm thinking about?

Are you thinking about it?
Are you thinking about, thinking about.
Are you thinking about what I'm thinking about.
