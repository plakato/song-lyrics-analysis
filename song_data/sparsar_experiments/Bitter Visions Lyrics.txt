Bitter Visions Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

Lie down beside me and hold*.
My hand to show me that.
I am not one of a thousand ones.
Show me that I'm the only child.
For which the day should die.
For which the sunlight turns dim.
When I am going to sleep.
Please tell me why shouldn't I think.
We're like a grain of sand.
Here on the island of loneliness.
All I want you is to.
Be the life I've been searching.
For which I'd give my own.
Keep all the cold things from me.
Strokes of fate.
Don't you overlook me.
Won't you remember my name.
Give me one memory.
Just to take all my fears far away.
Push my soul down the coast.
Will there be something to break.
My infinity sleep.
A strong black force.
Blood red thorns to keep me caught.
Will I fall to ashes and never be reborn.
Don't you overlook me.
Won't you remember my name.
Give me one memory.
Just to take all my fears far away.
Take my fears far away.
Take them away.
