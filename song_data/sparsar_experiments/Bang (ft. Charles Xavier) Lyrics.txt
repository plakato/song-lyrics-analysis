Bang (ft. Charles Xavier) Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


See how we came to make shit bang.
Whether you're cripping, blooding, pimping, thugging.
Serving the beans at yang yeah.
See how we came to make shit bang.
Whether your bluffin, cripping, puffing, sipping.
Crying in your place and yeah.

Pin 'em in the brain where niggas'll really bang or motherfuckers so lethal.
Run up on anybody wolfin' I'm tryna be puttin up with them niggas murder and.
making 'em feel evil.
With the life I teach you, mind full of sick thoughts but I see my no equal,.
I've seen people die in the middle of their life theres no sequal.
Move into the hallway quick do it everyday like all day shit, all day wit.
twistine 16 on all day shit, pull up off the rubber off of that shit.
Back at that spot to get off of english.
I was on venus, dreaming that i had an alien bitch fucking sucking my penis.
Hop in the life with the back of the straps have a brack finna yap like fuck.
All these niggas.
Pull up on the corner right here and test they nuts.
Bodies is fallin' the lord is fallin' well its time to leave us.
Who do you believe in  well its time for you to go in me jesus.
Nigga, now leave us, while I sit back and tip in my room.
They get too much love, anywhere that I go and that's whether you cripping thy.
mood.
Go with they favorite ?
They assorted yo fruit.
What type of nigga hella ill?
I just playing, puffing, if you actin' tough, homie, there's nothing for me to.
just kill.
And nigga that's real.
