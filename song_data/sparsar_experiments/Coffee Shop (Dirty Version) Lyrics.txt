Coffee Shop (Dirty Version) Lyrics
by Yung Joc.


Welcome to Starblocks.
It's Young Dirty.
Who's this?
It's Young Dirty!
Oh okay, what you need?
Ay, I need some of dem thangs man.
How many of 'em?
Two of 'em, give me two.
I got you, pull on around to the window pimp.
Aight shawty.
Ay ay ay Joc! {Whattup Pak Man}.
Cu-cuz out there say he need two of dem thangs.
{Oh yea he want TWO of 'em?}.
Yeah {Aight}.
Ay Joc {Whattup?} You know the motto! {Yo}.
Hustle by any means, nigga~!
HAAAAAH!

First I take they order like the coffee shop.
Then I steam it up and cook it like the coffee shop.
And then I sevre it out the window like the coffee shop.

And it ain't no returns at the coffee shop.
Man I make that paper stack up at my coffee shop.
One hit and they'll be back to the coffee shop.

Yung Joc.
Hey hey, ayyy, okay.
It's just another day at the coffee shop.
I grab them coffee beans, time to heat them coffee pots.
Turn the lights on, J's rush the parking lot.
This the neighborhood's number one stop 'n shop.
No regular, we only serve the best.
Fo' the low-low, cheaper than the rest~!

I'm takin orders, tell me who's nextOnly cash, no credit, no checks.
When your car stop, welcome to Starblocks.
You wanna triple your knot? Invest in our stock.
And now we doin numbers, just like the close-out.
Make sure to shop with me, before it's sold out.

Gorilla Zoe.
We cook it in the mornin, sell it during the midday.
Whip the cream, same color as ya latte.
I tell em vamanos, that's rapido.
You need some mo' {?}, you go call Gorilla Zoe.
You can get the co-ca, if you got to get it green.
Columbian, and I ain't talkin coffee bean.
12 to 12, there's always someone on the scene.
Starblocks, we get it out by any means.
Coffee shop, the drop spot, hand the ham, get my gwap.
Pocket stale, ounce for ounce, decaffinated off the top.
Rockstar, rollin rocks, piano keys work the block.
Welcome to Starblocks, we chop like the coffee shop, let's go.
See....

Yung Joc.
Ha, ah-ha, okay.
Everybody on the block know my nickname.
When you drop by, just ask for whip game.

And all my money get counted when the shifts change.
Then get 211 left by fo'-fifth manye.
If you need the number 1-800-Starblocks.
Coca latte, damned to make yo' heart stop.
And now the haters hot, so they run and tell the cops.
So they shut this down, we'll set up shop on another block.

Ay Pat.
In the South where they can find this at.

When we on the West coast where they gon' find us at.

What about up top shorty, where they gon' find us at.

Ay kids, please don't do drugs.
Just bring 'em to me, and I'll get rid of 'em at the -.
