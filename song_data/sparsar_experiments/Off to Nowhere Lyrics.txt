Off to Nowhere Lyrics

Off To Nowhere 
Produced by Vo-Kal,

I'm, childish, I'm selfish, I'm emotional 
I should try and find someone 
A lot more devotional 
That's. What she told me when 
We agreed to be friends 
When. She stopped to pretend 
I ain't lose that time that was spent 
Now. I'M driving in the fog 
With my high beams on 
Abel singing in my ear 
I wan na die to these songs, 
Man this pain, so deep 
Tired of crying to these songs 
But. I can't shake the feelings 
From when she lied in my arms 
From when she lied in my arms 
Straight to my face 
See the scars on my heart 
And, my sleeves tore up, 
I used to wear them so proud 
Man. My grandma used show me 
How to scream so loud 
And. Let the demons out 
It's, ok, to be scared. 
Now my tears seeping out 
Cause the thought of losing her 
Is. Invoking my past 
Cause. I still have the letter. 
She wrote me right before she passed. 
 
I love to get lost in the nighttime 
These feelings got me lost at the right time. 
And you had me tossing and turning 
I had to get out and free my mind as a life line. 
 
Took my love away just another day, 
Got to get lost, take away the pain 
Got to get lost, took away the pain 
And. My love lost. All I feel is pain 
Because. I am 
 
Still thinking. 
Where is my life right now, 
Only difference now. Is that 
The music, never quiets down 
I, try to keep it loud, 
Drowning out possible, sound 
Of, my irrational thinking, 
And, all the girls that turned me down: 
Saying, 
No! Sorry! You can't get this 
Abel hit a high note 
So. I don't have to reminisce 
I'm just trying to get lost 
In this Stephen King Mist 
And. Now my demons 
Looking, like Stephen King's IT 
Mixed with the clickers 
From the Last of Us 
I'm, still a good guy 
But, damn they killing of the last of us. 
I keep telling myself 
All women aren't the same 
But these girl's past sins 
Be, making my goodness stray 
But, I'm still a romantic 
True love not to blave 
Is, my intentions, dammit 
As. You wish 
I mutter under my breath. 
Princess bride of my dreams, 
Arriving in a white dress, 
 
, Vo-Kal,
