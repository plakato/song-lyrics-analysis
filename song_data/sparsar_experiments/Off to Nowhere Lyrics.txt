Off to Nowhere Lyrics

Off To Nowhere.
Produced by Vo-Kal.

I'm childish I'm selfish I'm emotional.
I should try and find someone.
A lot more devotional.
That's what she told me when.
We agreed to be friends.
When she stopped to pretend.
I ain't lose that time that was spent.
Now I'm driving in the fog.
With my high beams on.
Abel singing in my ear.
I wanna die to these songs.
Man this pain so deep.
Tired of crying to these songs.
But I can't shake the feelings.
From when she lied in my arms.
From when she lied in my arms.
Straight to my face.
See the scars on my heart.
And my sleeves tore up.
I used to wear them so proud.
Man my grandma used show me.
How to scream so loud.
And let the demons out.
It's ok to be scared.
Now my tears seeping out.
Cause the thought of losing her.
Is invoking my past.
Cause I still have the letter.
She wrote me right before she passed.

I love to get lost in the nighttime.
These feelings got me lost at the right time.
And you had me tossing and turning.
I had to get out and free my mind as a life line.

Took my love away just another day.
Got to get lost take away the pain.
Got to get lost took away the pain.
And my love lost all I feel is pain.
Because I am.

Still thinking.
Where is my life right now.
Only difference now is that.
The music never quiets down.
I try to keep it loud.
Drowning out possible sound.
Of my irrational thinking.
And all the girls that turned me down.
Saying.
No, sorry you can't get this.
Abel hit a high note.
So I don't have to reminisce.
I'm just trying to get lost.
In this Stephen King Mist.
And now my demons.
Looking like Stephen King's IT.
Mixed with the clickers.
From the Last of Us.
I'm still a good guy.
But damn they killing of the last of us.
I keep telling myself.
All women aren't the same.
But these girl's past sins.
Be making my goodness stray.
But I'm still a romantic.
True love not to blave.
Is my intentions dammit.
As you wish.
I mutter under my breath.
Princess bride of my dreams.
Arriving in a white dress.

Vo-Kal &amp; Goss.
I love to get lost in the nighttime.
These feelings got me lost at the right time.
And damn you had me tossing and turning.
I had to get out and free my mind as a life line.
Took my love away just another day.
Got to get lost take away the pain.
Got to get lost took away the pain.
And my name Goss all I see is rain.
Because I am.

So lost.
I don't want to come back.
Maybe get stuck in dream.
But no alarm to bring me back.
Won't be long I promise.
Man I swear I'm coming back.
I just need a few days alone.
To get me back on track.
So lost.
I don't want to come back.
Down the rabbit hole.
With the Cheshire Cat.
Maybe meet Alice.
Turn her into my queen.
No heartbreak allowed.
When you fucking the king.
So lost.
I don't want to come back.
In a galaxy far away.
Where Chewbacca has my back.
Millennium Falcon.
Will take us both where we want.
Maybe become a bounty hunter.
For Jabba the Hutt.
So lost.
I don't want to come back.
So lost.
I don't want to come back.
