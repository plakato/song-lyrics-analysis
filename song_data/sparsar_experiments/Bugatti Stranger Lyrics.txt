Bugatti Stranger Lyrics
by Russ.

Produced by Russ.

I can feel the distance.
Everything is good until it switches.
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference.
No no no no nooooo.

I remember ridin.
All around Gwinnett.
We used your weed man.
Cuz he had the connect.
Straight to Mexico.
So we smokin on that mota.
I never ever ever been so high.
Same job I was there temporary.
You were there permanent.
I was tryna be legendary.
So I had to quit.
I was still tryna love you.
Way before I dropped a song.
Russ who?
Turnt up dabblin' with new bodies.
I was tryna' vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti.
So she moved on.
I can't blame her.
Its definitely my fault shes a stranger.

I can feel the distance.
Everything is good until it switches.
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference.
No no no no nooooo.

I remember ridin'.
Now Im on a new girl.
Looked like princess jasmine.
She showed me a whole new world.
Tongue ring and tattoos.
All over her body.
And moved like she use to dance at Follies.
Gettin money trappin out the hotel.
But I didn't know cuz you know these hoes dont tell.
She was sellin her pussy for barely any money.
The cops tried to tell me when they cuffed me.
Turnt up dabblin with new bodies.
She was tryna vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti.
But thats all she knew.
So I can't blame her.
But damn I fell in love with a stranger.

I can feel the distance.
Everything is good until it switches.
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference.
No no no no nooooo.
