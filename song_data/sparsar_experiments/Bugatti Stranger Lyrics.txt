Bugatti Stranger Lyrics
by Russ.

Produced by Russ, 
 
I can feel the distance. 
Everything is good until it switches 
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference. 
No. No, no, no nooooo, 
, 
I, remember ridin 
All! Around Gwinnett 
We used your weed man 
Cuz. He had the connect 
Straight to Mexico 
So. We smokin on that mota 
I. Never ever ever been so high 
Same job. I was there temporary 
You were there permanent 
I was tryna, be legendary. 
So I had to quit. 
I was still tryna love. You 
Way before I dropped a song 
Russ who 
Turnt up dabblin' with new bodies. 
I was tryna' vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti 
So. She moved on 
I can't blame her 
Its. Definitely my fault shes, a stranger 
 
I can feel the distance. 
Everything is good until it switches 
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference: 
No. No, no, no nooooo, 
, 
I, remember ridin' 
Now Im on a new girl 
Looked like princess jasmine 
She, showed me a whole new world 
Tongue ring and tattoos 
All over her body. 
And moved like she use to dance at Follies, 
Gettin money, trappin out the hotel 
But, I didn't know cuz. You know these hoes dont tell 
She was sellin her pussy for barely any money. 
The cops tried to tell me when they cuffed me 
Turnt up dabblin with new bodies. 
She was tryna vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti, 
But thats. All she knew 
So. I can't blame her 
But. Damn I fell in love with a stranger .
 
I can feel the distance. 
Everything is good until it switches 
Really ain't that hard to tell the difference. 
No. No, no, no nooooo
