Journal Lyrics
by Ry.


Dear diary, i'm waking up to you.
Or journal as I make my way through.
Try to make my debut.

Hi you, it's been awhile since you've talked to Ry.
It's been awhile since I've opened you.
Cause Ryu been buisy street fighting.
And life is rolling up on me like McQueen's lighting.
So I watch Hitchcock movies just hoping I become immune to the frightening.
As life heightens, try to swim through my problems.
But i'm like a pack of black kids diving in the high end.

Interlude.
Dear Diary, what a day it's been.
Dear Diary, it's been just like a dream.
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn.
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn.

It's like a dream but it's feeling really shady.
I just lost my old lady, go back to her maybe?
Chance of that slimmer than Nicole Ritchie wearing Old Navy.
Cause i'm feeling like she played me.
Watching M*A*S*H as a couch potato, all gravy.
Failing at relationships so gone head &amp; grade me.
But I never ran away, I just exuded bravery.
And broke free from what some consider being whipped like slavery.
Emotional toll we put me through is amazingly crazy.

Dear diary, oh what a day it's been.
Stressing, depressing.
Like an abused adolescent.
Studying for finals but I haven't learned a lesson.
No urgency and last night my aunt just had surgery.
And watching other loved ones sick just sickens me.
Strickenly, striking me.
Feel as if the whole world fighting me.
But praying the after life won't be inviting me.
Cause I ain't trying to be where dying sees.
But rather be where the dying cease.
R.I.P. to my uncle Steve.
I hope J.R. can carry over your dynasty.
And R.I.P. my grandma Cookie.

As my heart hurts and my mind hovers.
My thoughts wander, my pen works wonders like Stevland Hardaway.
I'm going under.
But in the end what I write comes to life.
So till then i'mma keep you in the cupboard.
Dear Journal.
