Paroles de la chanson Came To Party 
 
Sun 
Light up that marijuana 
Pass me the bomb 
Fill up my cup 
Fill it up with Patron 
Sun, 
 
We just came to party 
And, I'm feelin' good 
I got the Remy for any women. That'S feeling loose 
Your man grillin', and he just up on my tennis, shoes 
I, think we met we gettin' checks like 
You, see her shinin' with diamonds glass, a swimmin' pool 
All the women drool when they see the linen jewels. 
The way you drifted by. It really got me in the mood 
Take me to the room and blow me up like a inner clue. 
 
Village, Boo, 
I just came to party 
Pulled up 
In, my old school, with the naughty 
Valet park, 
My shit next to 40's 
Tip Toe 
In the Coup. He look sporty 
And, I'm tryin' to leave tonight with at least three freaks 
Hit the room. You know until I skeet skeet 
I hope these clowns in here ain't tryin' to start beef, 
Cause that'll be the reason that niggas kickin' your front teeth: 
 
Refrain, Eminem 
We. Just came to party 
We ain't comin' hear to 
Start shit with nobody 
Girl. We just wan na see ya 
Work that work, that body 
With ya. Man lookin', like 
He, can murk somebody 
We just sipped a little 
Bit too much Bacardi 
He done tripped into this 
Cup and spilt it on me. 
Now he's startin' on some 
Shit this with the naughty 
He's about to get the 
Shit kicked out of him. 
 
I. Don'T got no time for these niggas. That'S playing games, 
I, don't take it as a diss unless you sayin' my name, 
I'm a bad influence. I smoke weed in front of kids 
I crack a bottle open and ask'em 
If. They wan na swig 
I'm the bad guy that touched your wife, 
Tip, Toe ain't, nothin', nice, 
I, rob Benz and still sport a gang of ice, 
We, gettin' money. We ain't trippin' off you hoe niggas 
Cause. If we want you we'll come show up at your show. Niggas 
 
Jayo Felony 
He'bout to get the 
Shit kicked the fucked out. Of'Em 
They call me 
Once y'all killin'. The Crips is lovin''em 
I split, his fuckin' 
Head for the pushin' and shovin''em 
So, crazy, 
I harass and embarrass him in public'em, 
Just, sayin' 
Hit, a stick that get a guerilla pissin' me with that is Crip. 
I could get sick as I wan na get cause. You know I'm the shit 
Never sound like an amateur. I damage niggas' brains, 
This buster 
Came, to be a party pooper, I'm insane 
, 
Refrain 
 
Got. A couple of handguns feel like my block, is ready. 
And, I'm livin' it Thug Life like I was Makaveli and 
Nigga this Zoo Life nigga I ride for it. 
I'Ll die for it and do federal time for it 
I'm a Inglewood nigga just have it at any brother. 
I ain't started gangbangin' because of my favorite color 
I done flip the whole brick 
I'm flippin', this cocaine, 
Got socas in line dancin' like it's Soul, Train

The party, don't pop off. Unless we pop up in it 
If the drama jump off the first to dive up in it, 
Infamous G on it baby Shady Aftermath, 
I done started my own shit, some life about to crack, 
Bloods and Crips. They love me 
Bang on the nigga. That'S phony! 
Pick up the phone with the police 
And, he was tryin' to kick it, but nigga's got cold feet: 
YAH
