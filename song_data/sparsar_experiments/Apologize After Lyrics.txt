Apologize After Lyrics
by Tyler Casey.

Gods gotta secret, they keep it.
Is he preaching or dreaming.
Who gon believe him?
Speaking with a meaning.
So you can see what he's seeking.
They told me to quit Now they can't Believe it.
Now I'm living scenic, dreamed, now achieve it.
Just look at my life, I movie scene it.
See it then we say it how we perceive it.
Say it cuzz we mean it.
My pain I bleed it.
Been through hell.
And Beat it.
Can't ya tell my demeanor.
Speaks for itself.
Reborn Out the flames, I'm a Phoenix.
