Battle Royale Lyrics
by The World Alive.

Breathe! They will turn their backs on me unless I decide to breathe.
You will forget me unless I breathe...
I've seen the worst in myself tonight. I almost lost the fight.
My mind is lost within my dreams.
Pinned down, wrapped up, in the arms of sleep.
I feel it slowing now. I can barely see my way out.

I won't forget.
And every single time I see your face it reminds me of why I walked away.
I won't forget.
And this is how you remind me that when I walked away.
I was right to save me from myself.
Goodbye, never say I am not enough.

I'm scared I've thrown it all away and I'll never be the same.
What have they done? What have I become....
This is the end of running from you.
I promise you that.

I won't forget.
And every single time I see your face it reminds me of why I walked away.
I won't forget.
And this is how you remind me that when I walked away.
I was right to save me from myself.
Goodbye, never say I am not enough.

Never say never, never say I'm not enough.
Never say that I....
Never say never, never say I'm not enough.
Never say I'm not enough!
