Akeachi Lyrics
by Rufio Summers.

You'll always be.
The one for me.
Through out everything and everyone.
I swear.
You'll always be.
The one for me.
Through out everything and everyone.
I swear.
I know I probably shouldn't talk to you.
But this is how I really feel.
And even though it wasn't meant to be.
Still in my heart I know it's real.
Yeah.
Everythime I close my eyes.
You're the only girl I see.
I think you finally realize.
After all this time.
It was me.
It was me.
Yeah.
You'll always be.
The one for me.
Through out everything and everyone.
I swear.
If only you would talk to me.
If only you would say those words.
If only you would take the time.
But I know you're hurt.
If only you would talk to me.
If only you would say those words.
If only you would make the time.
But I know you're hurt.
I'm weak without your love.
I'm weak without your love.
I'm weak without your love.
I'm weak without your love.
