My Story Lyrics
by Uniq Mic.


Girl yah say dat yah hear my story. 
How come you not hear it from me. 
Me hear your stories, but me. Let them pass 
Cah me. No people dem nah wan na see we last 
Do. You think dat am cheating 
Or. Do you believe in 
Everything dat pple say gyal 
Me can never betray you 
So people dem. Ah talk 
Say me bought a gyal, a clark. 
But me we with you around the clock, 
Our hands together, like 12 O'clock, 
From 6 O'clock to 6 O'clock. 
I, don't wan na take the spot of an ex in your life. I wan na make a better mark. 
Don'T. Make me feel like our love is a mistake. 
Don'T make me feel, like my faults, cause an earthquake 
Coz. I got love for you gal so much it puzzles cupid 
Coz. I got love for you gal. So much it puzzles cupid 
 
Oh baby. Would you hear my story 
Oh baby? Would you hear my story 
Oh baby? Would you hear my story 
It's best, you hear it from me: X2 
 
Promise. When I go blind, you be my writer 
Promise inah dih! Dark? U be my lighter 
In! The storm we'll be tighter, tighter, tighter X2 
 
So, now yah come and yah say. Yah. Sorry 
But, I forgave you before I told my story: 
Coz, you are dih gal. I would like to marry 
I'm always on my best, so we always tally 
Watch out fih dem, bwoiy dem. Just wan na see we part 
Even when me with mum dem gon' come n' report, 
Say dem, so me with someone must be sugar. Mum 
I mean its not the end. Many stories will come, 
I, never thought you could doubt 
I thought you know what we got. 
Is serious, like Romeo and Juliet 
My love like a villager, is straight from dih heart 
I see its gon na be hard 
And. If we pass it all, I will be glad 
So many beginnings and yet one start 
I will always love you alive or not.
