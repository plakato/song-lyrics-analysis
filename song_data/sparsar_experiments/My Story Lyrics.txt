My Story Lyrics
by Uniq Mic.


Girl yah say dat yah hear my story.
How come you not hear it from me.
Me hear your stories but me let them pass.
Cah me no people dem nah wanna see we last.
Do you think dat am cheating?
Or do you believe in?
Everything dat pple say, gyal.
Me can never betray, you.
So people dem ah talk.
Say me bought a gyal a clark.
But me we with you around the clock.
Our hands together like 12 O'clock.
From 6 O'clock to 6 O'clock.
I don't wanna take the spot of an ex in your life, I wanna make a better mark.
Don't make me feel like our love is a mistake.
Don't make me feel like my faults cause an earthquake.
Coz I got love for you gal, so much it puzzles cupid.
Coz I got love for you gal, so much it puzzles cupid.

Oh baby would you hear my story.
Oh baby would you hear my story.
Oh baby would you hear my story.
It's best you hear it from me X2.

Promise, when I go blind you be my writer.
Promise, inah dih dark u be my lighter.
In the storm, we'll be tighter, tighter, tighter X2.

So now yah come and yah say yah sorry.
But I forgave you before I told my story.
Coz you are dih gal I would like to marry.
I'm always on my best so we always tally.
Watch out fih dem bwoiy, dem just wanna see we part.
Even when me with mum, dem gon' come n' report.
Say dem so me with someone, must be sugar mum.
I mean its not the end, many stories will come.
I, never thought you could doubt.
I, thought you know what we got.
Is serious, like Romeo and Juliet.
My love like a villager is straight from dih heart.
I see, its gonna be hard.
And if we pass it all, I will be glad.
So many beginnings, and yet one start.
I will always love you, alive or not.

B.T.C.
