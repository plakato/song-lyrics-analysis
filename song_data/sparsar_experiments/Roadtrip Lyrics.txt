Roadtrip Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.

Yo eat these.
You're gonna start seeing some shit.
Just let it happen...
Just let it happen.

Wassup baby girl you're all natural.
You're in my mind like I'm back to school.
Learnin' bout you is nothing new.
I've known ya for life but only once I've met you.
It's crazy how we've only met once.
Went to level five then went back to one.
Square one ya raid my brain for fun.
Playing with you is like playing with a gun.
When I got you the world I control.
Living with you I am God mode.
Your presence simply makes time slow.
I honestly hope our relationship grows.
Hop in my trap we can make a road trip.
You can drive destination you control it.
You and me forever I'm hoping.
Whenever you come back I've got arms wide open.
Nothing could ever keep us apart.
You're meant me for me girl I feel it in my heart.
You make my world full of color and art.
Guide me baby you are now my North Star.
To be with you means to break the law.
But it's nature baby like dusk and dawn.
To be with you makes my whole life drawn.
Let's run away girl tonight we gone.
I got you in my sights and I start to trip.
You are so gorgeous that ya make me nervous.
Nothing else could make me feel like this.
You're one of a breed that's hard to miss.
For us I've planned a special date.
The right time mood and I picked the place.
You and I were chosen through fate.
I even see you when I hallucinate.
Uhn.
