Sand Creek Lyrics
by Voice.

It's the night on the battle fields.
The souls of the murdered warriors.
Go around.
Any cry for revenge.

Here I am, born to save my nation.
Come and fight with you, here is the location.
See the blood red sky tonight.
Thousand warrioirs have died.

The wolves roaming cross the battle ground.
The souls of the dead they have found.
Wolf warriors running up the hill.
Searching for the enemy to kill.

I call my nation!
Can you hear me in the darkness?
Be not afraid and fight!
To survive is your right!
I call my nation, call my nation....

Great spirit please help me in this heavy hour.
Give me courage, give me power.
Love is lost in this cruel time.
Only murder and only crime.

Tomorrow, I'll destroy their bloody fame.
The arrows rightly find their aim.
I drive away them from this land.
White man you will devour sand.

I call my nation....
