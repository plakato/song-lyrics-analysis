Knockin' Lyrics
by Xc.


Filling like it's summertime.
New tires got me riding like I wanna ride.
Shorty fly but she fronting like she something shy.
Look, I know you wanna come inside.
I tell her c'mon c'mon.
It don't matter if she riding as long as the beat knockin I'm good.
It don't matter if she riding as long as the beat knockin I'm good.

Yeah I'm good, I ain't been in the hood.
In a minute got niggas like you really think you should.
Wait I'mma shooting star if you see me in the hood.
You should so yourself a favor and wish a nigga would.
I'm good nigga c'mon still slick with the 9.
Got me riding round feeling just like the city is mine.
She want me in her ribs because the kid in his prime.
Now she jock me remember she wouldn't give me the time.
Now she watch me, get it watch me.
Friends tryna slow me up haters tryna stop me.
All the women love you now you know how the top be.
You'd probably turn em down but my nigga not me.
Shit they tell me just do it and get all those checks.
I hear the money come first the broads come next.
The white girls too just make sure they all come fresh.
Its only right that even Molly all on X.
An I'm Gone.
