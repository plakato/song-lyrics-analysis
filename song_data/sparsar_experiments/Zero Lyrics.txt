Zero Lyrics
by XOV.


Oh, zero fucks given, zero fucks allowed.
Very frankly, no, boy, they don't know, no, they don't know.
Oh, zero fucks given, zero fucks allowed.
Very frankly, no, boy, they don't know, no, they don't know.

Even if you kill yourself, it wouldn't matter.
Cause you're dead to me, dead to me, dead to me.
You mistake me for someone else.
You must be trippin', oh.
You're killing me, killing me, killing me.

Why you acting dumb? I'll pop you like a gum.
I'm tired of you phonies on me, run back to your mama.
'Member what I tell you, 'member what I tell you.
If you cross the line, I'll fucking nail you.

Oh, zero fucks given, zero fucks allowed.
Very frankly, no, boy, they don't know, no, they don't know.
Oh, zero fucks given, zero fucks allowed.
Very frankly, no, boy, they don't know, no, they don't know.

Interlude.
Zero, zero, zero, nah-nah.
Zero, nah-nah, nah-nah.
Zero, zero, zero, nah-nah.
Zero, nah-nah, nah-nah.

Why you wanna waste my time?
Oh, my pride, just stay out of it, out of it, out of it.
If I were you, I'd run and hide, don't start a fire.
You will burn you, you'll burn you, you'll burn down.

Why you acting dumb? I'll pop you like a gum.
I'm tired of you phonies on me, run back to your mama.
'Member what I tell you, 'member what I tell you.
If you cross the line, I'll fucking nail you.

Oh, zero fucks given, zero fucks allowed.
Very frankly, no, boy, they don't know, no, they don't know.
Oh, zero fucks given, zero fucks allowed.
Very frankly, no, boy, they don't know, no, they don't know.

Zero, zero, zero, nah-nah.
Zero, nah-nah, nah-nah.
Zero, zero, zero, nah-nah.
Zero, nah-nah, nah-nah.
