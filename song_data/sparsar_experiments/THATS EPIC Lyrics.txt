THATS EPIC.

BIG SCREENS ..BIG FILMS THATS EPIC/.

IM BIG IN INDUSTRY WELL RESPECTED/.
A HUNDRED OF WHATEVER THATS EPIC/.
IF A NIGGA GOT A HUNDRED RESPECT IT/.
INSTAGRAM A PIC ..THEY ON MY DICK ..THATS EPIC/.
FRONT PAGE MAGAZINE LADIES SAY THAT EPIC/.
WE UNDERGROUND KINGS SEE THE SIGNATURE EPIC/.
B.R.S HOW WE DO THAT EPIC/.

IM MOST POPULAR.
LIKE IM MOST WANTED/.

I KNOCK OFF P'S.
BUT IM MOST BLUNTED/.
YA SCARED MONEY. YA FUNds MOSTLY TAUNTED/.
IM MILLION DOLLAR NIGGA.
WHAT THEM HO'S TALKING/.

What i be driving.
What i be wearing /.
How im really rolling.
How they really feelim/.
I switch car's.
Like im out the dealer/.

U know hit the bar.
Pour out a little liquor/.

You work hard today.
But its all for the figures/.

Its gona pay off.
Trust my nigga/.

Blood sweat 2 tears.
I swear we realer /.
Pop one,roll something.
For my killers /.

Harlem clearly.
Its a broadway camio/.
On my own song like its not me dough/.
How he independent.
Every week new video/.

Boss up no middle man.
Connect with ya bro ..stones/.
Been a epic storey.
Know we put it down though/.
So i guess its a giving.
You reap what you sow/.

Been a epic storey.
Know we put it down though/.
So i guess its a giving.
You reap what you sow/.

BIG SCREENS ..BIG FILMS THATS EPIC/.
IM BIG IN INDUSTRY WELL RESPECTED/.
A HUNDRED OF WHATEVER THATS EPIC/.
IF A NIGGA GOT A HUNDRED RESPECT IT/.
INSTAGRAM A PIC ..THEY ON MY DICK ..THATS EPIC/.
FRONT PAGE MAGAZINE LADIES SAY THAT.
EPIC/.
WE UNDERGROUND KINGS SEE THE SIGNATURE EPIC/.
B.R.S HOW WE DO THAT EPIC/.
