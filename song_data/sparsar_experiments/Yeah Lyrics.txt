Yeah Lyrics
by 6th Sense.


Yeah, they say the first thought is the best thought.
Sons play catch with their dad while some don't wanna get caught.
Momma never blinked, until the stress brought a new love affair.
She runnin' there but stepped short.
Too close to be this far apart.
At the same time too far apart to be this close.
So we slip slow.
Hopin' that we think fast.
We the liks low a tip glass makes the drinks last.
A lil' longer than it's supposed to be.
So when I'm not drinkin' y'all can make a toast for me.
See.
I know I gotta get there hopefully.
I'm an optimist that spits it boastfully.
Get gone when it's gettin' tough.
How am I supposed to settle down when I can't even saddle up?
Reach a boilin' point, hear the kettle puff.
Pour it out and can't get enough.

A yeah yeah.
A yeah yeah.

Let the Cana flow and the Henny pour.
God's got a lot of names, the devil has many more.
It could be any random night with any whore.
Guaranteed to Tease you more than Demi Moore.
It's either Tom Petty or robin' any store.
Your heart breaks, you Free Falling to any floor.
Empty the register.
Take the petty cash.
Fill the truck with getty gas, let the semi blast.
Now the devil laughs.
You screamin' Oh Lord!
It's electrifying with no cord.
And the getaway don' made away with your Ford.
And you supposed to be chauffeur.
So tell me what you actin' slow for?
If a God is a woman then this whole time the devil's been your whore.
I heard she's high maintenance and does no chores.
But she'll open your mind behind closed doors.

A yeah yeah.
A yeah yeah.
