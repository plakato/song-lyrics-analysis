Zed Lyrics
by Running Legion.


100 bars and runnin' I'ma keep these lines. A-Coming 
Funny how I crunch on rappers, like Funyons and I'ma, come in 
Wait til midnight bust out a boom box for fun and 
Keep the mixtapes coming from the back and no more fronting 
Collapse. These detachable rappers, like it's nothing, til they're done in 
Give, em, all a run for they money 
Fun. When I take the people like Bun out, 
I confront em, take em out to my van and gun em 
See. These jewels right here, You're finna, run em 
Plenty of the puns here run through my blood 
Bothersome flows. Make me go from crip to blood 
Blood to crip, find my ski mask and dip 
Ain't. Nobody wanting me on a song with em unless a dump a clip, 
Of mental rental bars that I pay myself to spit 
Str8ridic. What you want with it
