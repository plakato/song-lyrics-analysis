Zed Lyrics
by Running Legion.


100 bars and runnin' I'ma keep these lines a-coming.
Funny how I crunch on rappers like Funyons and I'ma come in.
Wait til midnight bust out a boom box for fun and.
Keep the mixtapes coming from the back and no more fronting.
Collapse these detachable rappers like it's nothing til they're done in.
Give em all a run for they money.
Fun when I take the people like Bun out.
I confront em, take em out to my van and gun em.
See these jewels right here? You're finna run em.
Plenty of the puns here run through my blood.
Bothersome flows make me go from crip to blood.
Blood to crip, find my ski mask and dip.
Ain't nobody wanting me on a song with em unless a dump a clip.
Of mental rental bars that I pay myself to spit.
Str8ridic, what you want with it.
