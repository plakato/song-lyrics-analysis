Ain't Nothing But Love Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


Shoulda know when I looked into those eyes.
That I was going to be free.
From the bondage of those who never loved me.

And I shoulda know.
When he simply touched my hand.
He would understand.
All of my wants and all of my needs.
You were sent alone to love me.

Ain't nothing but love.

And it gets sweeter and sweeter.
Like heaven on earth.
Won't you just give me more and more.

You love me, baby.
Winter, spring, summer and fall.
And it's like I'm blinded.
I see no one but you at all.

Just the sound of your voices give me.
Chills up my spine, ya.
Oooh, it thrill me when.

You love me all night.
Your lips speak to me in a language I never knew.
Ooo.
But oh how.
I understand your heart.
When it feels the love from you.
