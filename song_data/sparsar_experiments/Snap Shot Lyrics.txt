Snap Shot Lyrics
by Sway UK.


I love the way you capture the rainbow 
I see the world in your smiley. Face 
I, don't need a thousand words to explain. 
Lets, take a Snap Shot. 
I'M feeling like the whole wide world is watching me, 
 
Partied out in Ghana, 
Driven through Nevada 
As. We watch that sunset. We listen to Nirvana 
We both saw that Sahara 
And. When I hold you, the memories come back, 
You can call this karma, and in the night you bring the Sun back 
Now flash it for me, 
Flash it for me. 
Capture this moment of passion for me, 
I, throw the pose you catch. The glory 
It is clear 
And. I know that on the day of matrimony you'll be here 
Long after the rest have disappeared. 
Come on lets. Take a Snap, 
 
Let's, take a Snap Shot. 
I'M feeling like the whole wide world is watching me. 
When, we come come come come together. We pose 
For. This moment we can hold inside our memories: 
 
Italy to Malta, 
To the beaches in Barcelona, 
Dubai to Ibiza Playa, D'en, Bossa, 
Studio to stadium 
Park to the palladium 
Dressed up like I'm Sinatra, 
Me and my pretty lady friend 
Now come flash it for me, 
Flash it For me, 
Capture the scene and the action for me 
I throw the pose you catch. The glory 
It is clear, 
After all is said and done. You'Ll still be here. 
Long after our worlds have disappeared. 
Come on, let's take a Snap 
 
Let's take a Snap Shot. 
I'M feeling, like the whole wide world is watching me. 
When, we come come come come together. We pose 
For. This moment we can hold inside our memories. 
Let'S take a Snap Shot, 
 
I love the way you capture the rainbow 
I see the world in your smiley. Face 
I: don't need a thousand words to explain. 
 
Let's, take a Snap Shot. 
I'M feeling like the whole wide world is watching me. 
When, we come come come come together. We pose 
For. This moment we can hold inside our memories. 
 
Let's take a Snap Shot
