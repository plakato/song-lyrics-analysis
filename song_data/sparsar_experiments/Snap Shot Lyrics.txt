Snap Shot Lyrics
by Sway UK.


I love the way you capture the rainbow.
I see the world in your smiley face.
I don't need a thousand words to explain.
Lets take a Snap Shot.
I'm feeling like the whole wide world is watching me.

Partied out in Ghana.
Driven through Nevada.
As we watch that sunset we listen to Nirvana.
We both saw that Sahara.
And when I hold you the memories come back.
You can call this karma and in the night you bring the Sun back.
Now, flash it for me.
Flash it for me.
Capture this moment of passion for me.
I throw the pose, you catch the glory.
It is clear?
And I know that on the day of matrimony you'll be here.
Long after the rest have disappeared.
Come on lets take a Snap.

Let's take a Snap Shot.
I'm feeling like the whole wide world is watching me.
When we come come come come together we pose.
For this moment we can hold inside our memories.

Italy to Malta.
To the beaches in Barcelona.
Dubai to Ibiza, Playa D'en Bossa.
Studio to stadium.
Park to the palladium.
Dressed up like I'm Sinatra.
Me and my pretty lady friend.
Now come, flash it for me.
Flash it for me.
Capture the scene and the action for me.
I throw the pose, you catch the glory.
It is clear?
After all is said and done you'll still be here.
Long after our worlds have disappeared.
Come on let's take a Snap.

Let's take a Snap Shot.
I'm feeling like the whole wide world is watching me.
When we come come come come together we pose.
For this moment we can hold inside our memories.
Let's take a Snap Shot.

I love the way you capture the rainbow.
I see the world in your smiley face.
I don't need a thousand words to explain.

Let's take a Snap Shot.
I'm feeling like the whole wide world is watching me.
When we come come come come together we pose.
For this moment we can hold inside our memories.

Let's take a Snap Shot.
