All Through The Night Lyrics
by Unknown.

All the World Is Desolation.
All the world is desolation.
Sad and quiet as the tomb.
Father has a penile stricture.
Mother has a droopy womb.
Sister Amy was aborted.
For the forty-second time;.
Cousin Hymie was deported.
For a homosexual crime.
All the world is desolation.
In our family, no one smiles.
All we do for recreation.
Is crack ice, for Grandma's piles.
Filename WLDESOL.
Play.exe WLDESOL.
