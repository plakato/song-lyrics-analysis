Focus
by Rushad Eggleston.

It goes and hides, in the tall wet grasses.
It creeps into a little ditch by the side of the road.
It's just a scared and wet opossum.
But it knows things.
That you people never knowed.

Is it brave? And is it faithful?
Those may only be attributes of men.
Is it wise? Is it successful?
What if not? What then?

It does it's thing, and it does it proudly.
At least that's how we rationalize Its thing.
It does not care for your opinion.
It only cares if it can survive.
