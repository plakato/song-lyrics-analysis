Bout It Lyrics
by 3LW.


You think you know me but you have no idea.
Act like you bout it.
Well lemme put this in your ear.
If you really bout it.
Do like a fus like you don't care.
If you bout it.
I dont doubt it.
Show me that you sure bout it.

Yung Joc:.
Ill get your mind off ties.
Cause the hustla don't stop.
If your girl don't chew then my name ain't Joc.
The money don't flip then the block ain't hot.
If she don't scream your name then your game just shot.
I gotta couple reasons you can call me the boss.
Ill drop a couple stacks and watch your ass get lost.
Joc the real shit Shorty bes believe that.
If you ain't ride till die.
Bring them car keys back.
Take your foot off the brake.
Baby gon ride out.
If them suckas wanna hate Put um in time out.
I get that cake you'll soon find out.
If you ever cross me you'll get crossed out.

3LW:.
I've seen it before in a rhyme and a roll.
Come and catch up with me baby don't stop.
Get to the floor whatchu waiting for.
Cause we can ride b straight to the top.
Wayy too long and now its the time to show um all that is not a game.
Cause I dont care what I'm lookin like.
I just wanna show you that im not goin no where.

You think you know me but you have no idea.
Act like you bout it.
Well lemme put this in your ear.
If you really bout it.
Do like a fus like you don't care.
If you bout it.
I dont doubt it.
Show me that you sure bout it.

Yung Joc:.
Imma get rich and imma die tryin'.
I ain't 50 Cent but respect my mind.
Respect my gansgsta respect my shine.
Put your click in chick if you step outta line.
I ain't Kanye but I been thru the wire.
Couple more albums before I retire.
Most of these rappers ain't nothin but liars.
How are they The Killers when they sing in the choir?
Straight from the bottom and im tryin' to get higher.
Too many strikes, Got too many priors.
Messin with us like playin with fire.
Get your wick split, time to meet your messiah.

3LW:.
I've seen it before in a rhyme and a roll.
Come and catch up with me baby don't stop.
Get to the floor whatchu waiting for.
Cause we can ride b straight to the top.
Wayy too long and now its the time to show um all that is not a game.
Cause I dont care what im lookin like.
I just wanna show you that im not goin no where.

You think you know me but you have no idea.
Act like you bout it.
Well lemme put this in your ear.
If you really bout it.
Do like a fus like you don't care.
If you bout it.
I dont doubt it.
Show me that you sure bout it.

Now I been walking up this road tryin' to find which way to go.
Tryin' to pull my faith.
Sometimes it seems like I don't know.
Now I gotta chance to touch ?
And the answers right in front of me.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

You think you know me but you have no idea.
Act like you bout it.
Well lemme put this in your ear.
If you really bout it.
Do like a fus like you don't care.
If you bout it.
I dont doubt it.
Show me that you sure bout it.

You think you know me but you have no idea.
Act like you bout it.
Well lemme put this in your ear.
If you really bout it.
Do like a fus like you don't care.
If you bout it.
I dont doubt it.
Show me that you sure bout it.
