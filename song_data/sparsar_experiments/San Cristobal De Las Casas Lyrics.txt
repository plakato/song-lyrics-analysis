San Cristobal De Las Casas Lyrics
by Swirlies.

If what is known is an exuberant excressence.

Then such as shown can only be a just defense.

San cristobal de las casas.

After six weeks of clashes.

Army bombed villages.

In the southern mountains zapata zapata.

Wait i was wrong.

I was shielded by my strength of heart.

Down i was doomed.

I was so dessicated.

Each day divides me.
