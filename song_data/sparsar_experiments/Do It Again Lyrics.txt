Do It Again Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


I fall over and over and over over over on you.
I get ill, I get ill, I get ill, you're the only one I'm into.

You and me.
Fit so tight.

I go lower and lower and lower lower living easy.
I don't know, I don't know what I got till it's over.

Can you do it again.
Do it again.
Do it again.
Can you do it again.

All the way, all the way, all the way, there's no where left we can meet.

I'm into what you do but I leave you nowhere.

All we need.
Is one more time.

I only get to live one life.
I won't pretend you're only mine.
Where will you go, where will you find the way.
To do it again.
