129 Lyrics
by The Undergods.


*awaiting transcription*.

I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal.
One millennium later, I'm still a cannibal.
Hands free answerable, memory expansible, sample you.
Question you, answer you, dismantle you.
To examine you in the flight path, a light craft.
If my rhymes climb height too fast you might crash.
Tried to get through though ____ taping Benazir Bhutto.
The assassin got too close.
Search party found a body, no prints, just nobbies.
Corpse smell like pastrami, anybody care to stop me?
The mic's out of tune, tell the sound engineer.
'bada bing bada boom' sound check one two.
You, what were you thinking? Who the fuck cares about lyrics?
How can this even exist?
It's the smiley face attached to the paper next to the gun rack.
Copenhagen did six sets of tracks.

*awaiting transcription*.

Cannibalise the kid spitting something that is fit for consumption.
Some niggas hate it some niggas love it, the shot which make you stiffen your.
stomach.
A thousand bars of running, you still tryna spit a hundred.
Too stubborn to see the UnderGods coming.
At Robert Lange Studio pressing buttons.
Plugging microphones in and busting, Big Punisher never punches.
I don't know how he does it, but he would be proud of it.
Canibus, Keith Murray, UnderGods, we coming!
