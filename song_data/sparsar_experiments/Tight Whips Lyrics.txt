Tight Whips Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

* first single.

We roll tight whips, everyday.
Bentley, Lex, Mercedes, and Escalades.
We roll tight whips, everyday.
Hustlin to make a big buck, but that's ok.

Choppa.
They say Choppa acting funny.
He ain't holla'd today.
He got the top back, you know his new Z28.
Holla at ya  is what a hater would say.
But they like my rims they just non-stop.
Look like they runnin away.

Magic.
I'm doing 80 in the lightin.
Duece trays on shine.
The cops try to pull me over but my rims done blinded em.
Cus I got 4 models in the back of my truck.
18 Bazooka bumpin my stuff.
Waking the BLOCK UP!

Master P.
Call me Ghetto Bill cus my seats they be Gucci.
And when I roll through the hood I got 2 or 3 hoochies.
Lou Vaton Airbags 'case I crash bad.
Futuristic kidded up like I'm Batman.
Represent the PROjects.
TV when I roll that.
Gamblin for a car, no.
Hope I don't blow that, WHOA!

Krazy.
We roll big body Benz's to Navigators.
In the hood, servin bricks like I'm a restaurant waiter.
Blue lights on the Jag cus I love to shine.
Keep it by my shorty so we be hard to find.
I ain't pay the car note, in about 3 months.
I'd rather, spend my paper on Henney and blunts.
Even when the truck stop those things be constant spinnin.
I'm a 504 Boy so I'm constant with it.

Slay Sean.
Roll around in tight whips.
Catch me on the night shift.
I'm just a Yungsta, I roll without a license.
My dogs is triflin, homie you can bite when.
First one in the hood on the block with the ice rims.
My seats be piped out, TVs with the lights out.
Hazards blinkin when I passed, try not to wipe out.
Dash with the wood grain, still in the hood man.
Catch me on lean car clean we doing big things.

Silkk The Shocker.
The way we do it.
She got a man, but she still gonna turn around.
Bentley, a bucket, what chick in her right mind gon' turn it down.
It's like No Limit said it, we all day, no laws.
Just parkin lot pimpin, car changin colors.
These boys go hard off.

Master P.
We leave the tags in the window, whodee.
Cus it's worth about a hundred.
V12 with remote control  engine runnin.
P.Miller throwbacks, with the convertable shift.
Candy paint thong version with the iced out chip.
Yokahama tires, whodee, but I only got 3.
No Limit Boys we thuggin I get a high for next week!

Lil' Romeo.
I'm fish tailin my dad, and I'm rollin on drops.
Sportin Sprewell to the curb I think I saw the cops.
They call me Richie Rich, I got my name in the seats.
X-Box in the front and the back DVDs.
Got TVs in the head rest with the big wide screen.
Got the navigation system with the phone in between.
Rollin a coupe with the top down when I go outdoors.
We roll on old days around here, that's 24s.

Weebie.
I got that flip flop paint on, my ride air ding dong.
The nose on my hood just like my ride stay PISSED off.
I roll through yo hood they ask me do I call lift off.
Like if it was made out of space with 20s and Kriss Kross.

T-Bo.
Gold grill glistens.
These chicks, call me Mista Cleana.
I'm Fiya Cracka, big ballin, it's something you've never seen.
I'm sippin lean, Off Thick playin on 6 TV screens.
Interior green, 24s, but you know, it ain't no thing.
HAH.

Master P.
We ghetto fab, let our bling bling show.
Driveway like a dealership, don't walk no more.
We wiling out, all day, all night.
Cus this is my life, my life, my life....
