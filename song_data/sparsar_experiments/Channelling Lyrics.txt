Channelling Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.


Channeling energy, through this track, 

Hugs kisses and kittens snowball fights in mittens 
Riches and bitches you're, a different type of wack 
You're all about defense, I'm all about attack 
Verbal crucifixion, when I jump on a track 
I'm making it my mission to envision a decision of replacing Your religion
with, a Vita filled addiction, 
Wielding, a butcher knife homie, get ready for incisions 
Arrive at your crib at night, dressed in chain mail 
Bust through the front door, throw away the knife grab a sprite and stab your
wife with a fucking hang nail: 
My credit's ruined
