Channelling Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.


Channeling energy through this track.

Hugs, kisses and kittens, snowball fights in mittens.
Riches and bitches, you're a different type of wack.
You're all about defense I'm all about attack.
Verbal crucifixion when I jump on a track.
I'm making it my mission to envision a decision of replacing your religion.
with a Vita filled addiction.
Wielding a butcher knife homie, get ready for incisions.
Arrive at your crib at night dressed in chain mail.
Bust through the front door throw away the knife, grab a sprite, and stab your.
wife with a fucking hang nail.
My credit's ruined; I'm using every bondsman to pay bail.
A first name basis with the ladies at the state jail.
Vacations in Haiti, lattes with rabies.
No regard for safety so when you see me know I'm crazy.

I channel energy from crazy shit I do.
When the beat drops I'm feasting, main course: you.
Draw strength from drawstrings wrapped around your larynx.
Your cranium is gushing; it's cordon bleu.
Throw on headphones, mic check one two.
Adrenaline rushes through my veins nothing new.
On CNN, or MTV who could this be destroying beats?
I channel energy from crazy shit I do.
When the beat drops I'm feasting, main course: you.
Draw strength from drawstrings wrapped around your larynx.
Your cranium is gushing; it's cordon bleu.
Throw on headphones, mic check one two.
Adrenaline rushes through my veins nothing new.
On CNN, or MTV who could this be destroying beats?

Got the BBC tuned into me.
I bcc'd Britney a pick of the D.
Got sixty-six clicks when the pics leaked.
And a feat on Tosh as the dick of the week.
Can I make it any clearer that I'm sucker free?
I'm giving it a shot you motherfucking freak.
Since year zero you've been a queer though.
Gave blowies after Christ died, you suck AD.
Already had a line about the BBC.
I've got one more though listen to me.
I'll grab your fucking hair and smash you in the TV.
How rude of you is it to interrupt the Soprano's!
I pull your bloody head out of the LCD And throw your bitch ass in the back.
of a heli.
Fly to north France and for the second time that day toss you motherfuckers in.
an English Channel!
Whoaa!!!
I broke up with my ex bitch last Tuesday.
Let me tell you man, this dating thing is a fool's game.
I'm looking for some fun now, I'm heading out to London.
I'm having a little trouble see lately I've been struggling.
Searching for some poon to slay but haven't seen nothing.
You know what they say tomorrow is a new day.
But while I'm in between fucks see me in the UK!!!

I channel energy from crazy shit I do.
When the beat drops I'm feasting, main course: you.
Draw strength from drawstrings wrapped around your larynx.
Your cranium is gushing; it's cordon bleu.
Throw on headphones, mic check one two.
Adrenaline rushes through my veins nothing new.
On CNN, or MTV, who could this be destroying beats?

I channel energy from crushing instrumentals.
You're standing next to me and in my presence you'll be blushing.
I've witnessed six events committed by sycophants who tried to kiss my ass,.
now that's a sick offense.
You're stuck with my production skills, the volume's temperamental.
Suction from this Russian feels like nothing but prescription pills.
A description of her friction skills will knock your tallywhacker stiffer than.
Tahiry wearing nothing but her six inch heels.

I channel energy from crazy shit I do.
When the beat drops I'm feasting, main course: you.
Draw strength from drawstrings wrapped around your larynx.
Your cranium is gushing; it's cordon bleu.
Throw on headphones, mic check one two.
Adrenaline rushes through my veins nothing new.
On CNN, or MTV, who could this be destroying beats?

Channelling energy through this track.

Saliva's made of leprosy so please don't try to step to me.
Impale you with a lance and tell you to make sure you live strong.
My first Christmas list? Yep a big bong.
I didn't want this bar anyway, so listen to what I'mma say.
I'mma waste like this: Bitch my dick's long!
Shit, six left, it's time for me to take a big step.
My debut's releasing before year end.
Title is TBD but put the EBT away no charge on this one it's my Christmas.
present.
I need a couple more secs, loan me some Extenze.
Peace to Ben Devlin, sayanora.
my friends.
But before I sign out, there's one last thing, the best is yet to come, heed.
my warning.
Bitches!!!
