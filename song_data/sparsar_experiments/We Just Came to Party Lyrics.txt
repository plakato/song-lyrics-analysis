We Just Came to Party Lyrics
by 40 Glocc.


Light up that marijuana.
Pass me the bong.
Fill up my cup.
Fill it up with Patron.
Suuuun.

We just came to party.
And I'm feelin' good.
I got the Remy for any women that's feeling loose.
Your man grillin' and he just up on my tennis shoes.
I think we met, we gettin' checks like.
You see her shinin' with diamonds, glass, a swimmin' pool.
All the women drool, when they see the linen jewels.
The way you drifted by, it really got me in the mood.
Take me to the room and blow me up like a inner clue.

I just came to party.
Pulled up.
In my old school, with the naughty.
Valet park.
My shit, next to 40's.
TipToe).
In the Coup, he look sporty.
And I'm tryin' to leave tonight, with at least three freaks.
Hit the room, you know, until I skeet, skeet.
I hope these clowns in here ain't tryin' to start beef.
Cause that'll be the reason that niggas kickin' your front teeth.

We just came to party.
We ain't comin' hear to.
Start shit with nobody.
Girl, we just wanna see ya.
Work that, work that, body.
With ya man lookin' like.
He, can murk somebody.
We just sipped a little.
Bit too much Bacardi.
He done tripped into this.
Cup, and spilt it on me.
Now, he's startin' on some.
Shit, this with the naughty.
He's about to get the.
Shit, kicked,  out of him.

I don't got no time for these niggas that's playing games.
I don't take it as a diss unless you sayin' my name.
I'm a bad influence, I smoke weed in front of kids.
I crack a bottle open and ask 'em.
If they wanna swig.
I'm the bad guy that touched your wife.
TipToe ain't nothin' nice.
I rob Benz's and still sport a gang of ice.
We gettin' money, we ain't trippin' off you ho niggas.
Cause if we want you, we'll come show up at your show, niggas.

He 'bout to get the.
Shit kicked the fucked out of 'em.
They call me 1 Shot killin the Crips is lovin' 'em.
I split his fuckin'.
Head for the pushin' and shovin' 'em.
So crazy.
I harass and embarrass him in public 'em.
Just sayin'.
Hit a stick that get a guerilla pissin' me with that is Crip.
I could get sick as I wanna get, cause you know I'm the shit.
Never sound like an amateur, I damage niggas' brains.
This buster.
Came to be a party pooper, I'm insane.

Got a couple of handguns, feel like my block is ready.
And I'm livin' it Thug Life, like I was Makaveli and.
Nigga, this Zoo Life, nigga, I ride for it.
I'll die for it and do federal time for it.
I'm a inglewood nigga just had me angry brother.
I am starting gangbanging because of my favorite color.
I done flip the whole brick.
I'm flippin' this cocaine.
Got socas in line, dancin' like it's Soul Train.

The party don't pop off, unless we pop up in it.
If the drama jump off, the first to dive up in it.
Infamous/G-Unit it,.

Aftermath.
I done started my own shit, Zoo Life about to crack.
Bloods and Crips, they love me.
Bang on the nigga that's phony  sauce).
Pick up the phone with the police.
And he was tryin' to kick it, but nigga's got cold feet.
