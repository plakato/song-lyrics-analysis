Tonight And Forever.
I could be, I could be, I could be your girl.
Tonight and forever, forever and ever.
For tonight and forever, forever and ever.
I see the way you look at me.
Don't you understand your love can set you free.
It's so easy we can be together for tonight and forever.
Don't you know that I can't wait.
Come with me don't hesitate.
I can be your girl, I can rock your world.
Be all your wildest dreams.

For tonight and forever baby.
It's so easy we could be together.
For tonight and forever darling.
Just come with me and be together tonight.
Tonight and forever.
Forever tonight, forever and ever.
Tonight and forever.
Just because your on your own, it dosn't mean thats what you need.
Come and take a chance on this romance.
I'll be your fantasy.
Nothing is a guarantee, but one thing I know for sure.
I can be your girl, I can rock your world.
Be all your wildest dreams.

I could be your girl.
Tonight and forever.
