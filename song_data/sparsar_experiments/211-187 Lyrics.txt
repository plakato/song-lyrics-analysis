211-187 Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..


211s at night 187s in the day light.
Nigga we just don't give a fuck.
211s at night 187s in the day light.
Nigga we just don't give a fuck.

Nigga's be try'na rep and some fool's.
Be try'na buck but Lil' Ya that type of.
Nigga that just don't give a fuck.
But Nathan and if you hatin' then.
You's a hater but I'm straight out that three.
So how the fuck you gonna fade her.
Soldier with a heart made of steel.
Like my nigga B, I handle business on the real and.
Then I chill make my rounds, pick up my car from.
My bitches cuz I be hittin' 'em regular like.
Dre be hittin' his switches.
Clockin' my riches as I stroll through my hood.
Puffin' on a blunt givin' love where it's all good and.
For you nigga's who ain't go no love.
I ain't got no love for you chumps.
Cuz I'm a smoke 'em and choke 'em.
Like a Philly Blunt.
Yeah, I'm gettin' my grove on.
I'm ready to move on.
To another level rob some nigga's or.
Whatever I got big nut's.
I got a big heart like I said it's been that way.
Since fuckin' start, you know me from my.
Fuckin' crew, you know what I'm bound to do.
I got a pit, I'm ready to spit.
I'm ready to serve to uhh!

I even got's the boogy bangin' at'cha.
Grab my Zookie if I have to.
Daze you up like Daz.
I don't give a fuck like Kurupt.
I'm dismantlin' MC's that come against me.
Me and the Tecster in broad day light.
We comin' to do thee fuck it.
Of course, I'm a show no remorse.
Don't mean the boss, I never forget hoes.

I'm gettin' skiet like that, I'm slippery like ease wax.
I chop ya down, like a disciple, with my riffle.
As if a white boy you disrespected my a-gender and.
Called me a nigga.

{ Yella Boy}.

I'm dumpin' you bitches out like Boss Hog.
I don't give a fuck about y'all.
You don't know what I would do to you.
But I know what'cha will do to you.
I would serve you, I would fuck clean over you.

Y'all know that I'm back.
Like brand new wax on brand new Cadalac's.
I'm mourin' I'm yawnin' plus I just.
Lost my equipment bag.

Sweatin' like a Zoo-Loo to do you.
It's best you fuckin' scram.
I'm a champion I'm dumpin' on 'em.
I'm actin' a motherfuckin' donkey on 'em.

I'm bout to do a jack.
I got on all black.
In my hand lies a tool that.
I call my Mack.
It's like my best friend cuz when.
I spin the bin it don't get jammed.
Bullet's chargin' like a ram.
You bet's believe when them hollow's hit'cha.
You goin' in pocket bitch, you better drop it.
One nigga tested my nut's he had the nerve to flex and.
On his arm was a Rolex, He flinched for.
His gat that was stashed in his suit coat.
I had to show him, I had to fuck over him.
Stunt a fuckin' lick of that hit and it was on.
Then I put the key's on the lab and.
Niggas started pushin' slab's.
My pocket's started gettin' swole.
My knot has thickened.
That's how it is when.
Nigga like Ya, is flippin' halves to.
Quickers, Quarter Bird's, to Bird's.
Keep a brew full of rock's.
Cuz my bitch need a serve.
Uploadin' kilt, puttin' in clip's at the.
Same time, beatin' you nigga's down.
With my bat if I ain't got that iron.
Leave yo Mama cryin' why you shot my only son.
Gave him three to the head, smoke a blunt now I'm done.
Give me a bag of that helllo, and snort it up my nostril.
Drain got me loose as a goose and I wanna shot.
We put in work, doin' dirt everyday.
It's twelve noon, let's go get somebody.
To buy some yae, can't be no miner.
Got to be a Big Tymer, because I''m down to.
Pill a couple of cap's and get these nigga's out they snap's.
Cuz I'm.

You bitches don't know the fuckin' size of this shit.
I'm on the rise with this shit.
See tommorow, the fuckin' clip bitch.
2-2-6 my boy's comin'.
Mag-11 hollow tip's nigga.
Better start runnin'.
When I start comin' up the block.
With my Glock like a mad man.
In a mad rage face is caught on the front page.
Let them bitches catch me down bad.
With my 12-gage.

You despise, why I'm up in disguise.
Now you paralyzed plus you realize.
To stop playin' with me.
My click is quick to let them bullet's fly.
Click ya fuckin' self ya bitch you.
For you get downed.

We droppin' 'em stop playin' with me.
Stop playin' with me.
