2112 - sililoquy live Lyrics
by Rush.

... I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in.
my total despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I.
can no longer live under the control of the Federation, but there is no other.
place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of.
my dream, and know peace at last..
The sleep is still in my eyes.
The dream is still in my head.
I heave a sigh and sadly smile.
And lie a while in bed.
I wish that it might come to pass.
Not fade like all my dreams....
Just think of what my life might be.
In a world like I have seen!
I don't think I can carry on.
Carry on this cold and empty life.
My spirits are low in the depths of despair.
My lifeblood....
...spills over....
