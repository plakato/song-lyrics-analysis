And If Lyrics
by 3 Melancholy Gypsies.


Now why you gotta give me attitude for young lady?
Them lips and them curves will drive a grown man crazy.
Wasn't trying to be rude.
I was just thinking maybe.
We'd talk a little bit.
And later on make some babies.

Eligh.
Then she stepped in my direction.
Angelic face to my drunken sway.
PSC led her to me.
Through a dark club in San Jose.
Had no way to identify.
What was right in front of my eyes.
Smoking beedies with my guys.
MURS was there he can testify.
I was swallowed up by love.
And what followed up were doves.
In the garden of my bedroom where we frolicked.
Pendulum didn't mean a thing.
She put on one of my black t-shirts.
A polaroid in the back of my cabinet.
Never throw it away.
But now I can tell you fellas.
Love is a weed when you don't water it properly.
Stopping me in my tracks.
Heart attack can't relax.
The artifacts on the road to become a man are hard to take.
To face the heart break.
These taste the hard steaks/stakes.

Scarub.
Sunday banana splittin'.
Monday for chocolate fudgin'.
Tuesday vanilla frenchin'.
Wednesday cinnamon lovin'.
Thursday neapolitian.
Friday let's lemon meringue ya thang with a twist.
Saturdays we can do what you wish.

And if ya had ya heart broken can't find ya way back.
And if ya.
Teach me and love me then girl it's on.
And if ya.
Wonder where my heart is next to yours it be at.
And if ya.
Caught a deaf tone from being left alone.
And if ya.
Only got about a B cup then it's cool.
And if ya.
Show me yours then I'll show you mine.
And if ya.
Trust in me then I'll trust in you.
And if ya.
Come with me I know you'll change your mind.

You seek my company but I'm not up for that.
Just want to lay you on your back.
Don't want to conversate in fact.
Don't know if we should kick it at all.
Don't want to cause your heart to fall.
Don't want to be that man.
I'm not the one.
I'm not at all.

MURS.
The hardest thing I ever had to do was break your heart.
Kinda knew our relationship was doomed from the start.
Cause after we'd fight you would listen to Gwen.
She kinda always knew she'd end up my ex-girlfriend.
And now that shit's true.
No Doubt.
Treated her like royalty whenever we'd go out.
I bought her Hollister.
New Cenies.
Volcom.
Triple 5 Soul.
And a bunch of other tokens.
Trips to New York.
Japan.
Oakland.
So when you say I never loved you it's insultin'.
Cool as a couple maybe better not together.
Plus I know I was a good boyfriends so, whatever.

Scarub.
I'm my father's son.
Yeah a momma's boy.
With some brotherly love.
Love pretty girls oh boy.
Got this half.
You could make it whole.
Let's enjoy.
Moments while they last.
Let's play, you could be my favorite toy.

And if ya had ya heart broken can't find ya way back.
And if ya.
Teach me and love me then girl it's on.
And if ya.
Wonder where my heart is next to yours it be at.
And if ya.
Caught a deaf tone from being left alone.
And if ya.
Only got about a B cup then it's cool.
And if ya.
Show me yours then I'll show you mine.
And if ya.
Trust in me then I'll trust in you.
And if ya.
Come with me I know you'll change your mind.

MURS.
And if I'm not your lover.
If I'm not your friend.
I'm a single young man at his sexual peak.
Type to need a different freak everyday of the week.

Scarub.
Yeah, I use to know this girl as fly as Saturdays.
With a wholesome type of soul like a Sunday.
Had a straight up approach like a Monday.
Strong head, long legs that stretched past Tuesday.
Woozy.
I felt, knew it was love came Wednesday.

My hearts a flower, her water Thursday I'm thirsty.
Friday she left me and I withered in the worst way.
Yeah, for her I was weak.
Melancholy for months.
Through it all learned how to separate my needs from my wants.
And what I need is what you got.
If what you got done front.
Happiness, a journey not a destination.
I'm willing to run.

Eligh.
For once.
Everything's gonna be alright.
Summer days will come our way.
Morning comes to bring brighter suns.
Clouds part for the weaker hearts.
Camaraderie with your boys on a Sunday afternoon.
What's better than that?
Staring at asses passing.
Hollering and laughing.

Hey, hey hey girl. Hey, did you see that?
She got an ass like hallelujah and a face like praise Jesus.
I need to go to Bible study. Get naked for Jesus!
