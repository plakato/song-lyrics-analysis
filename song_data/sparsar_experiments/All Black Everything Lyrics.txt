All Black Everything Lyrics
by B-Real.


All black everything, just like paint.
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising.
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East.
I'm moving, I'm moving.
East and the East and the killers in the West.
Just get smoking.
Why you fucking with stress?

Break in my line if you don't know the dock.
Get in line, don't fuck around looking for my crop.
Get dumb as the one that's the rise to the top.
Product of Versace I'mma hit you with the Glock.
Bitch we riding high, we keep stacking.
Money like coats in closets, keep racking.
Backs like Cali quakes, keep cracking.
Skilled what the doctor know, what up with no slacking.

All black everything, just like paint.
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising.
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East.
I'm moving, I'm moving.
East and the East and the killers in the West.
Just get smoking.
Why you fucking with stress?

Snow Tha Product.
Killer in the game and the one finna pop.
So don't mind if I come around, spend a little guap.
Snow been the chick, all these rap bitches jock.
All these bum bitches, I'm the cream of the crop.
Look I'm riding 'round, I been got it.
Robbing these banks, these dudes, and these pockets.
All of these hating bitches still watching.
But I don't get no pay for no talking.
Constant.

All black everything, just like paint.
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising.
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East.
I'm moving, I'm moving.
East and the East and the killers in the West.
Just get smoking.
Why you fucking with stress?

Couple rolled up for the road.
Hotbox any spot that I go.
Yah.
Steamed like a pot on the stove.
Chase that with a shot of Patron.
Fuck stacking my papers.
But that just assesses I make it.
I know boy it's coming.
You don't like where I'm at.
Then I know for a fact.
People really hate what I'm becoming.
I came in this game with a flow and a flame.
Never go'n switch man the story's the same.
Drinking this liquor, I fuck with my niggas.
I always deliver, that's not gonna change.
Ribs on a raise, tits on a frame.
Jet fuel on a plane.
Her ass is ridic, she grabbed on my stick.
Trying drive me insane.

All black everything, just like paint.
Rolling down the block, I'm cruising.
Ship it to the South, to the North, to the East.
I'm moving, I'm moving.
East and the East and the killers in the West.
Just get smoking.
Why you fucking with stress?
