Fatal Blow Lyrics
by X-Raided  (a.k.a. Nefarious).

Next Song is Fatal Blow.
The yeah yeah yeah, Black Market.
X-raided in the house.
We break it down.

Tell me who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.

We pass the microphone back and fourth like chronic.
Twisted linguistics, no english, just spanish and ebonics.
Criminalistic thug luv ain't a damn thang changed.
And most kickin potent shit that fucks up brains.
Now im a ellaborate the first one.
First we collaborated and built a bomb.
Now its time to detonate it.
A nigga we kickin americas ass like vietnam.
Nationwide be it bump from cali to kingdom com.
X-Raided's a veteran in this nor cali rap field.
Decapitatin motherfuckers wit this lyrical sword I build.
Medieval on that ass, chop off your tongue, pull out your teeth.
Youll never rap again, fuck up your voice, like D-O-C.
Cause X-Raided dont play no games.
But them deadly kinds.
Lyrical combatic release the verbal acrobatics from a deadly mind.
I fuck wit fellas and people wit major melan-in.
And all the remainin get hit wit the automatic flamin.
Now.

Tell me who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Tell me who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Tell me who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.

My mental state ain't never been straight.
Wit the draw like desparados.
Who get away in old school chevys'.
Pressin heavy on the throttle.
Empty bottles of hennesy.
And my eye out for the riders.
We yell fuck the P-D.
Yeah thats the motto.
We callin on all thugs.
No fakes, murder for hire.
Paper chases, we callin more races.
Wipin out these disses of haters.
Deliverin fatal blows, vital sign turned flat line.
And ??????
Get gone like 9-9, fine line.
Borderin on the safe, should of been rules up in this shit.
And niggas like us done made a name up in this shit.
And we could feel the rage up in this shit.
So feel me i'm ready, lets go.
Toe to toe, blow for blow, dumpin four fours.
Ain't no turnin back dawg really.
Only bitches bow down.
And in my town, you throw pistol.
You better release all your rounds.
We organized keepin killas on a payrolla.
Dumpin fatal blows on black market like some soldiers.
Now really nigga.

Who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Tell me who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.

I get in your head like a migrain, nine ruger.
Eat up your brain like a mind tumor.
Quick to pursue you.
On a high speed leave you D-O-A.
Dead on Arrival.
And Im your rival like Dennis hopper is Keauna Reaves.
I go no lower than fifty's, right.
And im ridin on do or die.
Creep on your spot.
And blow it up like the cage and the rock.
Quick to get a gage and cock it.
Blast off like rockets from NASA.
Bullets black pits on that ass.
And make michael johnson run faster.
Smashin bullshit like matadors.
Run up nigga todo.
Cell lay where you hit the floor.
The holes in your torsoe.
You better duck we comin.
Deep as seven seven regis.
Blowin up niggas stomachs.
Like feedin alcaseltzer to seagulls.
And we take flight like eagles.
When its time to hit that ass.
I'm lyrically harder.
Than an escape attempt from alcatraz.
Think you can win come and try me.
I'll have you in a I-C-U wit gasoline up in your I-V.
I light a match.
And put it up under your nose.
And dare you to breathe.
Caboom, brains all over the room.
Cause your stupid ass sneezed.
Squeeze the trigga.
On a mental fourty four that I packed.
No retreat, no surrender when black market attacts.
Deliverin fatal blows.

Who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Tell me who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
Who could fuck wit my thugs.
Pumpin hollow high slugs.
