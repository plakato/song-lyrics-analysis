Curiosity Lyrics

Ah-hah, ahaha.
This is tripped out, tripped out.
I wonder what you look like?
Haha, like dat like dat.
Well where you at?
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Buk buk!!

You are the pain, that puts stress on my brain.
How do I refrain, from making you a bloodstain?
Just a memory would suffice; it would be nice.
I would love to see your face, it would be tight.
Who are you? How old are you? How tall are you?
What do you think of the daughter that wants to meet you?
Do I have your smile and your eyes that have kept me strong?
Will you ever be man enough to show your face;.
Will you roll on the situation, a nation will rise.
No higher than this woman, a fatherless child.
Let me ask you some'in: is that you asleep on the sidewalk.
With no place to stay and with no one to talk?
Maybe you have a wife and kids and a big house.
Or maybe you're a business man with the big clout.
Who knows how the story goes, maybe I will see.
I'm just a fatherless child, filled with curiosity.

Sometimes, I get a little lonely.
So where you at?
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way.
You know, I wonder who you are.
So where you at?
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Do you know that I'm here?

My homies and family claim not to understand me.
Why do I talk with so much emotion.
And why do I feel so deeply? Huh.
I have this habit of bitin my nails when I'm deep in thought.
Did you do the same, did you get slapped when you got caught?
Sometimes I feel my soul is tired from the lack of sleep.
It won't rest until I see you and you see me.
I remember when I asked my momma, Where is he?

I remember cause momma used to get mad zooted.
So two years later I asked again and she had to prove it.
She couldn't, in fact, she forgot what she said the first time.
When I asked again, she said you died in a car crash, fine.
But momma you lied to me and my friends were right.
This is the real reason why this case was sealed tight.
Help me to understand what's going on with this man.
Who I've never seen or met, tell me did you plan.
For me not to see, some pieces of this puzzle.
Are missing in action, I feel that this is trouble.
She said, You really wanna know? God please help me.
I didn't know your father, THE BASTARD RAPED ME!

So where you at?
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
It's like dat like dat now.

Do my ears deceive me, I'm confused, do they tease me.
Because of the man I thought was dad, took my mother and...
Forced her to - I CAN'T SAY IT MAN!
What's this world comin to, why'd you do my moms fool??
She was only thirteen, you betta find yo' screws.
Because like you, I am a fool too.
Let me take that back, I don't wanna be like that.
But now you listen and pay witness to this raw facts.
Life is a three-sixty, what goes around comes around.
And back to your cypher, it will come to haunt you down.
Who knows, you probably turned over a new leaf.
You might be pushin up daisies, if so it wouldn't amaze me.
In fact, let's be accurate, it wouldn't fade me.
Rape, is punishable by death, alright bet.
Now here we go cause God is bringin me to my knees.
To deal with the pain of my, secret curiosity.

Sometimes, I get a little lonely.
So where you at?
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way.
You know, I wonder who you are.
So where you at?
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Do you know that I'm here?
Do you know? Do you know?

Sometimes, I get a little lonely.
So where you at?
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way.
Like dat, like dat.
You know, I wonder who you are.
Do you know that I'm here?
So where you at? Where you at?

It's like dat, like dat now...
It's like dat, like dat now.. what?
It's like dat, like dat now...
