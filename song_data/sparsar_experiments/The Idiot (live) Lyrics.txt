The Idiot (live) Lyrics
by Zippy Kid.

Kwa, I am too simple.
They think I am the modern hero.
Let her Know I want to lick her pussy slow.
Taste all of her.
And make her part of me.
I'm the shizo ground beatmaker.
I am the idiot.
And i am working hard to be myself.
What's new, my whore?
I want you, I want more,I can't stop.

I am working hard, I am your pilot.
I am your king of abstract hip-hop.
Let me fuck your perfect ass one more time gently.
Then I drunk one cup of water and returned to this normal reality.
I am from C.I.A., I check your D.N.A.
It's okay.
You're my fragile quuen.
