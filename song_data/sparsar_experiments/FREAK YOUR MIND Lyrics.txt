FREAK YOUR MIND Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Heartless vagabond 
Fresh from out of town 
I, I'm looking for a new high 
Someone to help me get by 
Barstool, veteran 
Liquid medicine 
You. You found me at a good time. 
Tonight you can be all mine. 
 
Don't got ta, be no centerfold. 
For me to want to take you home 
If. Your heart is beating 
Let me freak your body. Baby 
Don't have to be the perfect ten 
For us to be more than friends. 
If. Your heart is beating 
Let me freak your body, baby 
But. First imma freak your mind: 
 
Cold, kiss deviant, 
Dark room telling no lies 
We're sitting in the black light 
Painting on you with a flashlight 
 
I, don't care what you want from life 
Only care. What you are tonight, 
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful, 
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful, 
 
Don't got ta, be no centerfold. 
For me to want to take you home 
If. Your heart is beating 
Let me freak your body. Baby 
Don't have to be the perfect ten 
For us to be more than friends. 
If. Your heart is beating 
Let me freak your body, baby 
But. First imma freak your mind. 
 
I, don't care what you want from life 
Only care. What you are tonight, 
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful, 
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful, 
 
Don't got ta, be no centerfold. 
For me to want to take you home 
If. Your heart is beating. 
Don'T have to be the perfect ten 
For us to be more than friends. 
If. Your heart is beating beating, beating, beating 
Let me freak your body baby 
Let me freak your ... 
Let me freak your body. Baby 
Let me freak your body, baby 
But. First imma freak your mind. 
 
I, don't care what you want from life 
Only care. What you are tonight, 
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful, 
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
