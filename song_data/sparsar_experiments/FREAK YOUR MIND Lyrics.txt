FREAK YOUR MIND Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Heartless vagabond.
Fresh from out of town.
I, I'm looking for a new high.
Someone to help me get by.
Barstool veteran.
Liquid medicine.
You, you found me at a good time.
Tonight you can be all mine.

Don't gotta be no centerfold.
For me to want to take you home.
If your heart is beating.
Let me freak your body baby.
Don't have to be the perfect ten.
For us to be more than friends.
If your heart is beating.
Let me freak your body baby.
But first, imma freak your mind.

Cold kiss, deviant.
Dark room telling no lies.
We're sitting in the black light.
Painting on you with a flashlight.

I don't care what you want from life.
Only care what you are tonight.
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful.
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful.

Don't gotta be no centerfold.
For me to want to take you home.
If your heart is beating.
Let me freak your body baby.
Don't have to be the perfect ten.
For us to be more than friends.
If your heart is beating.
Let me freak your body baby.
But first, imma freak your mind.

I don't care what you want from life.
Only care what you are tonight.
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful.
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful.

Don't gotta be no centerfold.
For me to want to take you home.
If your heart is beating.
Don't have to be the perfect ten.
For us to be more than friends.
If your heart is beating, beating, beating, beating.
Let me freak your body baby.
Let me freak your....
Let me freak your body baby.
Let me freak your body baby.
But first, imma freak your mind.

I don't care what you want from life.
Only care what you are tonight.
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful.
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful.
