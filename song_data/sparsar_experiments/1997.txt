1997
by Aziz.

I got Bars for days, fuck that centuries.
The life is meant for me, the cars, expensive V's.
Cause this a nigga in rare form.
They screamin encore, die hard fans demand more.
Lyrical style war, bumblebee transforming.
Its like I'm tryna see you but I'm in a sandstorm.
Wind blows can you hear the wind blow?
Rain fallin outside of my window.
Dumbo.
Im takin a chance, takin a risk.
Trying to make an advance.
Do I start with the beats or.
Start with the words.
Was it the chicken or egg.
Makin a play, writing these rhymes.
I'm trying to make you a fan.
Gimme the mule.
Gimme the food dog.
Plus I'm taking you land.
Fuck it.
We don't need your 40 acres.
I'm all good, all the time.
Man, I think I'm David Aker.
I'm tryna eat with Iron Chefs and.
Live next to Lakers.
It's like a big world open for the taking.
I'm bout to make it.
It's limitless.
