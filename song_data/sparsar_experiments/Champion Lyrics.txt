Champion Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Teach, these kids, yes, they are/ 
Reach higher than the stars/ 
Don't, be trapped in self-pity/ 
Don't, be snatched in Hell's city/ 
Stop with self-loathing/ 
When. The going gets tough. The tough gets going. 
Yeah yeah, yeah, 
 
My GPA's, a 3.4/ 
I know it's good who's, keeping score. / 
Help the Dominican, Republic/ 
Break rules that hold me in ain't nothing/, 
Yeah Yeah. My pride gets the best of me/ 
My Conscience, a cop arresting me/ 
But, there's no cali spins/ or medallions/ 
Or rallies, in/, the allies, when/ 
The fallacies, admit/ 
The mistakes of ‘manly' men/ 
But service/ is my purpose/ 
Until, it's disturbing/ to close them. Curtains/ 
God's gives approval stamp me in/, a mentor/ 
God-send who sent for / The champion/ 
Yeah yeah yeah 
 
Teach, these kids. Yes, they are/ 
Reach higher than the stars/ 
Don't, be trapped in self-pity/ 
Don't, be snatched in Hell's city/ 
Stop with self-loathing/ 
When. The going gets. Tough, the tough gets going, 
Yeah yeah, yeah 
 
Change your game up, you just have'ta / 
It's, sad, like Kobe/, drops 80/ on the Raptors/ 
Spliffing the joints/ get sympathy, points/, 
From your crew, all little silly boys/, 
Like Tech said ‘Life sucks, doesn't it/ 
But, you shouldn't Screw up another's life because of it/ 
That other's life is yours and you're cheating/ 
Yourself. Out of all you achieved, and/ 
The Godsends, you willingly ignored/ 
Façade ends. It kills me to the core/. 
You were meant to live for so much more/. 
So switch your feet to a brand new war/ 
Rebel against me: bring down yourself/ 
Farewell to all greed, sing down your Hell/ 
Yeah yeah yeah 
 
 Love, 
 
No, I didn't/ 
God. Thanks for reminding now I get it/ 
I'll stampede in/ as the champion/ 
Tag team battle time to slap me in/ 
I'll stop with my self-loathing/ 
The going getting tough. So I get going/ 
I'm, not a coward. I won't fold in/ 
Yeah yeah yeah
