Fred Broca Lyrics
by Wordburglar.


Know where we're going?
It's a nice little town.
No infidels here telling kids to settle down.
You're gonna get a new daddy soon.
It's taken care of-.
Bada-bing, bada-boom.
Strapped in a padded room, plastic surgery.
Wasn't optional- drastic ?
For eternal allegiance.
A legion of elite sentries to help you lead pleasantries.
Huh! And they call us the enemy?
But anyone with my face is a.
friend of me.
So take a look in the mirror and tell me who's there.
I'm going to a fair and assume there.
If we catch you in a Cee-Gee.
T-shirt.
And you don't know my name-.
You're gonna be hurt.
That'll do.
Didn't mean to rattle you.
Consider it a battle groove.
Shut up, and drink your apple juice.

It's Fred Broca.
I gotcha.
?: With light skills I be the-.
?: Duplicate rap-roller.
It's Fred Broca.
The original hair-rocker.
?: I went through torture.
?: Deadly sounds under author.
You don't know who you talk ta.
Your door's locked out.
?: Your doubt in tongues, like you're trying to test me.

And now you're wondering.
Where the fuck your mate went?
Yeah, he had an engagement.
For attitude rearrangement.
Scanner in the basement.
Now let's talk about your placement.
Dental plans, and fully paid vacations on Broca Beach.
H and R? Tell them to talk to me.
We pay top-notch fees for jobs well done.
But failure? Well, son.
Let's not go there.
It's no fair to conjugate.
Dire conjecture upon your fate.
Just take your papers.
And be on your way.
Andale!
Working on a way to weather dominate.
On the crate?
Don't be concerned.
We got a saying:.
A dead body.
Is a lesson learned.
Don't stress the earn.
Just keep your eyes on the prize.
And who knows?
You might just stay alive.

end.
?: We need a man for the operation, you know the MO.
You better act proper.
Fuck elopers.
I take it in the chopper.
I got the weather dominator.
Your liver gets chopped up.
I got the MASS device.
See you later- ah.
It's Fred Broca.
You know who you talk to.
It's Fred Broca.
Suck my Broca.
?: We need a man for the operation, you know the MO.
It's Fred Broca.
