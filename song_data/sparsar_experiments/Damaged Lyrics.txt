Damaged Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

You say you're all messed up, you're not OK.
You've been fucked up for so long.
There's nothing good about this and nothing real will ever come of this.

So now it's done and you're going home all alone.
And I'm going home by myself.
Tomorrow night I'll meet someone else so on and on and on.

They say they're messed up it's not OK.
They act like they're so damaged.
But everyone is, everyone is done with it for good.
