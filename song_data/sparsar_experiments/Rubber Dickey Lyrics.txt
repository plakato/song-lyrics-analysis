Rubber Dickey Lyrics
by Andrew E..


My name is what?!
My name is who?!
Yo!, Rubber Dickey!
Have you ever heard about this little thing.
Maliet pero kasiyahan ang bini-bring.
At binibigay at dinudulot.
Binibili pero di mapupulot.
Kumukulot ang 'yong forehead, why?
Kasi hindi mo alam where to buy.
So stop, look.
