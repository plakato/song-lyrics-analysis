Fly Low Carrion Crow Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Fly low ye carrion crow.
And seize my body for the debt I owe.
And drop me high into the depths below.
For the things I've seen no one else should know.

It's just you and me and my rib cage brain.
We polish the brass and we dust the pain.
And we lay down fallow like slaveless chains.
And they call us sick as though they're all so sane.

So fly low ye carrion crow.
And seize my body for to free my soul.
And drop me high into the depths below.
For the things I've seen no one else should know.

What speak you of a love so bold?
No song could sing, no word could hold.
Well I warn you now of an end foretold.
And a life long waiting for a desperate road.

So fly low ye carrion crow.
Seize my body for it lives no more.
And drop me high into the depths below.
For the things I've seen no one else should know.
For the things I've seen no one else should know.
For the things I've seen no one else should know.
