Plug Snitchin Lyrics
by Yung nation.

Oh so now you with them thugs.
You got caught wearin a wire, snitchin on ya plug.
Later on, I saw you at the club in some jeans and them hoes was fittin.
snug.
I know my pockets skinny but they showin love.
But back to you, you don't know how to finesse the jugs.
I run when it's a drug flood.
You snitchin on yo team, nigga time to Sub.
Thats why I fucked ya baby momma.
In ya tub.
While I was sippin mud, now it's time to roll some bud.
But you a.
Snitchin ass nigga so I'm Watchin out for them cameras.
Lightin L's like.
Candles, I'm a young Kolonel Sanders.
You wearin more plugs than a Panel.
We ballin', you.
Can't change the channel.
You ain't talkin money, you.
Canceled.
Don't double dribble, might get handled.
They'll rob you for your.
Gucci sandles.

This is what it was x3.
A nigga got caught up and started snitchin on his plug.
This is what it was x3.
He raided out his plug x3.

Well this happened on a sunny day.
A young nigga swangin out his driveway.
His dumb ass went the wrong way, so the laws followed him to the chase.
And now he met a drug dealer with a bag.
And in that bag it had a whole lotta cash.
And in that bag it had a whole lotta grass, some mud and some coke.
He was breaking bad.
And then the law got right behind him after.
He started runnin, he didn't know the next chapter.
And then he saw the law boys in the front, his dumb ass had to put out his.
blunt.
And then he snitched on his plug, he a fool.
And he told them where that nigga went to school.
And he told that nigga where that nigga live.
Two days later, they bust in his crib.
