Curveballs Lyrics
by The Wombats.


There's no greater sight.
Than you in your underwear removing mine.
And I've never felt this good.
There's not a news flash that could deflate my mood.
Then.

His clothes on your floor.
I recognise this decor.
I've been here before.

And I can't I can't keep-keeping up with these curveballs.
And the more I try, the more my back's against the wall.
And I can't I can't keep-keeping up with these curveballs.
Curveballs.

Who, when, why, how?
I tend to focus on the past and not the now.
I'll be over this soon.
But some images adhere like superglue, like....

Six hands in one bed.
Could he not afford the rent.
This feeling won't end.

And I can't I can't keep-keeping up with these curveballs.
And the more I try, the more my back's against the wall.
And I can't I can't keep-keeping up with these curveballs.
Curveballs.

What do you expect me to say?
When the paintings I paint start to leap out their frames.
Sweetheart what do you want me to say?

And I can't I can't keep-keeping up with these curveballs.
And the more I dodge, the more my back's against the wall.
And I can't I can't keep-keeping up with these curveballs.
Curveballs.
