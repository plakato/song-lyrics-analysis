Bombay Dreams Lyrics
by Arash.

Sunrise, burning heat.
Nothing is as travelled as a Bombay street.
Contradictions, city of extremes.
Anything is possible in Bombay dreams.
Some live and die in debt.
Others making millions on the Internet.
Contradictions, city of extremes.
Anything is possible in Bombay dreams.
This.
Is coming! Hip hip hooray!
CNN cameras are here in Bombay.
The slums have to be painted right away.
Or next year.
Will come from L.A.!
We eunuchs bring you luck.
Give us money, you will see.
I can change your fortune.
If you are kind to me.
But if you refuse us.
You'll face adversity.
Even though we're not.
The men we used to be.
Life's never easy.
Every day you struggle through.
You lean on me.
I lean on you.
