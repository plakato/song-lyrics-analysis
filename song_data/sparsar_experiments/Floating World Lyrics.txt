Floating World Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Headlights through my window at night.
White light on my baby, alright.
But when she comes, she's a stranger to me.

I'm lost in the floating world.
In the floating world.
In the floating world.
Beyond this one.

I keep a vision of a life that's free.
I felt the crows closing in on me.
And if my nerves, if my nerves should fail me.

I'll stop in the floating world.
In the floating world.
In the floating world.
Beyond this one.

If I was.
If I was careless.
Careless with your heart.

The lines on.
Lines on paper.
Make for only tearing apart.

Raised up like an animal.
Raised up like a beast.
Raised up like an animal.

I'm staying up in this little room.
Popped the window fashion red and blue.

I don't live here, I'm an occupant.
I reside in the floating world.
In the floating world.
In the floating world.
Beyond this one.

Beyond this.
Beyond this.
Beyond this one.
Beyond this.
Beyond this one.
