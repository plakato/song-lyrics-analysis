Bad Reputation Lyrics
by Vixen.

You're always on the edge, but you can never find a thrill.
Fame and fortune's left you hungry still.
You win young innocence with sly seduction.
Indulgence paves the road to your destruction.

What do you believe in.
And why do they believe in you?

You got a bad reputation, you're a wild sensation.
Your ego's on the front line and your pride's on stage.
You got a bad reputation, with no hesitation.
Will you take the young ones with you on your way down to the grave?

You're walking a thin line, but you take no advice.
You got all the answers, you don't need no compromise.
You sure convinced us all that you're a world class sinner.
You're running in a race, where there's never any winners.

What do you believe in.
And what do people see in you?

You got a bad reputation, you're a wild sensation.
Your ego's on the front line and your pride's on stage.
You got a bad reputation, with no hesitation.
Will you take the young ones with you on your way down to the grave?

Ain't nothing new about what you're going through, no.
It's the same old theme, of the bad boy scene.
You're in control, but your hands aren't on the wheel.
I bet we'll see you at the crossroads trying to make a deal!
But that ain't no deal, it's a long way down.

Yeah, you got a bad reputation, you're a wild sensation.
Your ego's on the front line and your pride's on stage.
You got a bad reputation, you got no hesitation.
Taking the young ones with you on your way down to the grave.
Bad reputation, you're a wild sensation.
Your ego's on the front line and your pride's on stage.
You got a bad reputation, you got no hesitation.
Taking the young ones with you on your way down to the grave.
Bad reputation, wild sensation.
B-b-b-bad reputation, yeah.
You got a bad reputation, you're a wild sensation.
Your ego's on the front line and your pride's on stage.
You got a bad reputation.
