Control (Response To Kendrick Lamar) Lyrics
by Yung DSJ.

Imma destroy every rapper you ever heard of.
Nigga This murder.
I heard they wanted beef but im the grill to your burger.
Popping like a burner.
Never given imma earner.
K dot imma have u wishing u ain't say shit Timmy turner.
Like even tho I'm looking up to you it's competition.
But ain't no competition when I give em all tuition.
The fire really been risen.
I never stopped it with my pistons.
But yo pistons just get pissed in.
Ain't no car but I be driven.
I be living like a broke motherfucker really is.
N I don't lie about shit cause a broke nigga what he is.
Bitch I'm turning 19 but the flow be getting big.
You can talk to Chris Hansen.
You ain't fuckin with This kid.
You ain't fuckin with this lyrical vental str8 from the pencil.
A nigga hop on your beat and then own it.
It ain't no rental.
And you hearing someone better must be fucking with your mental.
My punch lines would make u wanna call in with your dental.
Plan I am the man.
Really making it was the plan.
But I guess going for the throne is gon make em know who I am.
So it's dsj.
Never play.
Could give a fuck on what you say.
U think u kill it everyday.
But I kill it like June thru may.
This my time no flavor flav.
I see thru u like a x ray.
I buired u and the instrumental.
Spitting all on your grave.
I don't condone any nigga dissing me on a rap.
So if you diss me in a rap.
Just know yo career is a rap.
Gotta flow just like a Mac.
I gotta flow this ain't a rap.
I gotta flow that'll make a nasty nas really step back.
I stepped up in the game.
With ambition to be on top.
And They ain't give the kid a chance so I killed you in your spot.
Assassination was the plot.
To kill you right when u were hot.
Drop followers to zero.
When showing just what your really not.
Thats me.
Can't you see.
Call out the new and pay a fee.
Funny I'm looking up to you.
But im the dude u wanna be.
Tho I ain't sold a cd.
Or got a spot on tv.
Just know I'm throwing shots and I ain't talkin bbs.
He be.
The youngest and the hardest with the flowin.
Niggas think they got the drive.
But after this they need a towin.

The retaliation of hating.
Plus Making these niggas wait and.
I told you all to be patient.
I'm never faking just making.
All the music I'm creating.
To have a flow that's hotter than that nigga they callin satin.
I'm prayin.
That they hear me so clearly.
I hope they fear me.
Just knowin that they ain't near me.
I killed em all know I'm dearly.
Sorry that I ain't sorry.
No joking I ain't Chris Farley.
And My flow just got you canceled.
How it feel to be I Carly.
