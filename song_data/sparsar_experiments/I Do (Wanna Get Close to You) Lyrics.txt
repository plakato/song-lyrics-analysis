by 3LW.


Yeaa - uh huh.
Yeaa - uh huh.
Yeaa - uh huh.
Yeaa - uh huh.
Yeaa - uh huh.
Yeaa - uh huh.
Yeaa - uh huh.
Yeaa - uh huh.

Rollin' in the club like what.
I, got the view of you on lockdown.
Then I saw you starin' at me.
It wasn't soundin' too bad.
Ya make me think that your for one.
Lickin' your lips at me for fun.
While the DJ's makin' him sway.
So won't you come stare to me.
If you.

Wanna get down, baby, I do.
Holla at me, baby, ooh-ooh.
If you rollin' deep tonight, then I do.
Wanna, know you.
And If you, wanna get down, baby, it's cool.
Holla at me, baby, ooh-ooh.
If you're always ridiculous, then I do.
Wanna get close to you.

Your ice, your gear, your sex appeal.
Your, game so tight, you got me feenin'.
Wantin' you alone with me.
Is the illest fantasy.
You make me feel like wilin' out.
Showin' you what it's about, yeah.
Got it goin' on uptown.
Now let me see you work it out on me.

I'm sure you had me to get her, baby.
Baby, how can I just make you see.
I'm the only one you need.
So please let me know right now.
Cause it's true.
I want you.
Say that you want me too.

Ladies and gentlemen.
I know I could make you scream like a woman' supposed to.
Seems like you wanna get closer.
Well, Boo here's the ticket, come through, we could kick it.
One hun' twenty five, foot two is addictest.
My view is the sickest.
It's true, been convicted, I'm probably needin' a girl.
In other words, ma, I'm due for some kisses, I'm due for some huggin'.
And all them dudes that be buggin', I ain't with it.
I'm through wit the thuggin', I'm due for some lovin'.
I need a wife in my life and ma.
You're lookin' like you're due for a husband.
I choose not to love 'em.
These chicks runnin' around actin' like straight fools in the public.
Let's move with the subject because I came with a better plot.
Just play the game and you'll never flop.
It's in your brain, you already hot.
But you ain't close to my age, so you better stop.

Let's go, don't stop.
Let's go, don't stop.
Ah ha, ha.
Yea.
Yea.
I like this one right here, c'mon.
Hah - hah.
Hah - hah.
Hah - hah.
Yea . . hah.
