Backseat Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.


Girl we been on this telephone.
Everynight for a whole month long.
You laying on your canopy.
And listen to all my fantasy.
But now it's time to feel to come true.
It's time for me to come through.
And pick you up in a 63 SS Drop Top Chevrolet.
Barrel in the back clip to the side 3 wheel motion as I ride.
Get in yo crib and you can jump in.
With a sound system bumping.
Bumping some 69.
And we's gonna have us a good old time.
Cruising up and down the street.
My brother's driveway in the backseat.

Backseat seat seat seat.
In my older brother 63 3-3-3.
And baby since ya so sweet sweet sweet sweet.
I promise not to go deep, go deep.

Shorty yo this for real.
A brotha got a fresh lip on Bonneville.
12:15 for the funky beat.
Gucci tie and a Gucci seat.
Tell me girl do your thing.
If you got butter on my Gucci leg.
Polo shirts and a Polo tie.
I got scooped by a eighty clown.
With a broom, newtangelo.
Bumping some D' Angelo.
Whats up whats up whats up with you.
Girl let me know what you gonna do.
Cuz if you wit it then it's on.
At 8 O' clock be home.
I'll pick you up and we gone.
In a backseat of a throne.

Backseat seat seat seat.
In my older brother 63 3-3-3.
And baby since ya so sweet sweet sweet.
I promise not to go deep, go deep.
Backseat seat seat seat.
In the front and roll.
In the backseat lets roll.
Do the roll.
Come on baby lets roll.
Jump in the front and roll.
Do the roll.

Tell ya mamma ain't nothing going on.
Me and you go have a shop alone.
We just gonna cruise the blcok.
And I'll have ya back by 12 O' clock.
They seemed in it believed in me.
It's gonna be old.
All night long from 8 to 12 in the backseat of a Volv.

I'm letting ya know that ya'll cruise the block.
Cuz I ain't got no cash for the Marriot.
All I got is enough cash to fill this Bonneville up with gas.
Go get a bike eat from B.K. kid to drive here to catch a replay.
Every same thing we saw last week.
Me and you up in the backseat.

Backseat seat.
