KGD (KILLwaukee God Damn!) Lyrics
by Vivafidel & Gat Turner.

Jeremiah Wright's sermon:  And the United States of America government, when.
it came to treating her citizens of Indian decent fairly, she failed. She put.
them on reservations. When it came to treating her citizens of Japanese decent.
fairly, she failed. She put them in internment prison camps. When it came to.
treating her citizens of African decent fairly, America failed. She put them.
in chains. The government put them in slave quarters, put them on auction.
blocks, put them in cotton fields, put them in inferior schools, put them in.
substandard housing, put them in scientific experiments, put them in the.
lowest paying jobs, put them outside the equal protection of the law, kept.
them out of their racist bastions of higher education and locked them into.
position of hopelessness and helplessness. The government gives them the.
drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law, and then wants us to.
sing “God Bless America.” No, no, no. Not “God Bless America”; God Damn.
America! That's in the Bible, for killing innocent people. God Damn America.
for treating her citizen as less than human. God Damn America as long as she.
keeps trying to act like she is God and she is supreme!

GAT TURNER lyrics:.
I hail straight from Killwaukee - They say, Where is that? Somewhere between.
shooting heroine &amp; smokin' crackIn between a mega-church and a dirty.
mosque - Purgatory and the Land of the Lost.
You can take a walk and see death on the bus stop - Take a ride and see death.
in a drop top/ Death in the eyes of the Black cop, White cop - Death in.
disguise of a Playstation... Xbox /It's like standing trial or living on the.
run - Either a devil with a gavel, or a devil with a gun.
Being broke and famous or rich and infamous - Public Enemy #1, the arch-.
nemesis /With nothing to lose &amp; nothing to gain - Like a shot to your.
head, or an aneurysm in your brain.
Living check to check and drowning in debt - Then busting at the repo cuz ends.
ain't met/ Between Babylon and Nazareth - The coroner and Lazarus - Disbelief.
and hypocrisy is hazardous.
That shit is dangerous - Between Ebonics and Spanglish - anguish, so high that.
it's painless /It's like being sent a Messenger of God, then on the Day of.
Judgement see that you're on the wrong side.
Between the funeral and the wake, the make believe and the fake, somewhere.
between the fix &amp; the break /Or having superhuman strength with a.
kryptonite allergy - but yet and still it's not another place I'd rather be /.
Ain't got no S on my chest - I'm picking slugs out my vest - Cuz even niggas.
you show love be jealous of success.

VIVA FIDEL Lyrics:.
I was raised around the corner from murder one / taught not to ask questions or.
play dumb / I became numb / by the time I was old enough to stay out late.
/ the.
hustlers couldn't wait/ they put they rocks in my face and said let's get paid.
/.
try explaining that to ya teachers in the 6th grade / then suddenly the same.
one who showed me cooked crack/ under the street light / was doin prison time.
/.
this ain't right / where the guns and the coke really come from? my lil cousin got.
caught sellin dum-dums / to an undercover / then he killed his baby mamma.
brother / cuz its 187/ but only on eachother/ just the smell of the.
crabs in a barrel is unbearable/sending condolences to the community this.
shit is terrible/ the lack of love lead to the life of a thug/ or T.he.
H.ate U. G.ave L.il I.nfants F.ucked E.verything/ rebuildin self esteem in these.
kings and queens/ seen some shit on the news the next day we forget.
/.
like the pigs kill the people cause they still get away with it/ no retaliation /.
no consequence/ not only in Wisconsin / not only in this country / we.
might can't get no justice / but we can get some money / so let's get down to.
business / hustle like I'm hungry / get up on ya fitness / hit the weights do.
some running/ we ready for whatever /like that's part of the plan/ they ask me.
where I'm from &amp; I be like Killwaukee goddamn!!
