Disbeliever Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

I'm walking and watching.
All the things I've seen before a million times.
It's cold neon light.
A stranger on his way.
A world, that's always been cold and gray.
Just wait another day.

Tell me now - Is this the world that you have made for me?
Is this all you'll let me be?

Hold the children for me.
That scream in the night because of you.
It's empty - no light.
You've told me that I am impersonation of humanity.
I only want to cease to be.

Tell me now - Is this the only world that you have made for me?
Is this all you'll let me be?

Hold me now.
Save me from the ghosts that haunt my nights.
Don't say goodbye.
When the shadows fall down on me in the night.
Alone - again.

Just for your love I will be undead for all eternity.
You're watching over me.
Lovely creature - darkest night.
Come back again to me.
It's just like you...were once before.

Don't tell me now that this is the only world - oh no.
Don't tell me about your point of view.
Save it for someone else - what to do.
Alone again.
