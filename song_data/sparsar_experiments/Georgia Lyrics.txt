Georgia Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.


Baby love, baby love, don't leave 
Baby, love, baby love, don't leave 
Walked in the door, but he's all coked out 
Lights down low and the music's loud 
The radio's on he's tweaking out 
Cause. He doubled the dose two months ago. 
But. She just found out 
Even when I'm dreaming. I can hear her screaming. 
She said that she's leaving baby love, baby love, don't leave 
But. I know she'll leave 
In the middle of the night. She'Ll leave she'll leave 
By the morning light she'll leave 
 
“In the morning. I stole the love from ya, ” she said, leave 
In the morning I'll, be on my way to Georgia. Oh 
Oh, like a thief in the night you've taken. What'S mine 
Now, it's cold by my side, it's cold by my side, because 
In the morning you'll be on your way to Georgia. 
Stole the love right from ya 
 
Everything we had is faded, love, 
The, memories, ain't good enough, 
To, take my mind off what we lost 
So, I'm stuck here. Sipping these codeine cups 
I feel like I'm dreaming 
But. I still can't find the meaning 
Yeah. It feels like I'm barely breathing 
And, I'm begging you to stay 
She'll leave she'll leave 
By the morning light she'll leave 
 
“In. The morning. I stole the love from ya, ” she said, leave 
In the morning I'll be on my way to Georgia. Oh 
Oh, like a thief in the night you've taken. What'S mine, 
Now, it's cold by my side, it's cold by my side, because 
In the morning you'll be on your way to Georgia. 
Stole the love right from ya 
 
You've, taken the love 
You've taken the love that I crave 
You've taken the love 
You've taken the love that I crave from me. 
You'Ve taken the love 
You've taken the love that I crave, 
You've taken the love 
You've taken the love that I crave from me. 
By the morning light she'll leave 
 
“In the morning. I stole the love from ya, ” she said, leave 
In the morning I'll, be on my way to Georgia. Oh 
Oh, like a thief in the night you've taken. What'S mine 
Now, it's cold by my side, it's cold by my side, because 
In the morning you'll be on your way to Georgia. 
Stole the love right from ya
