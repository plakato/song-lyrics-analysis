Futuristic Love Lyrics
by Yung La.


Ladies hands up.
Puerto Ric &amp; Elroy Jetson.
Yeah  Yeah.
Come on!

Shawty gone and hop in my ride.
I'm talking bout that futuristic love are you wit it.
I think I wanna Elroy you.
So come sex me.
With that stupid fruity swag tell me what it's gone be.

It's Young Elroy, what's up Babydoll.
I love your slim waist and long hair barbie doll.
I can be your Ken, your homie, lover, friend.
Candle lit, ooo baby we can get it in.
Futuristic loving, R &amp; B thuggin'.
Looking in the mirror, kill ya with the doggy.
Left hand behind my head, I'm tryna rock the bed.
Elroy ya, then fall asleep between ya legs.
I'mma make your beg, daddy bring it in.
Wood on deck, shawty you can get it in.
Ladies stand up, throw your hands up.
Stupid fruity love, cause baby this the anthem.

Five one, brown skin, itty bitty waist.
110, long hair, with the baby face.
Like Babyface, she got whip appeal.
She ain't nothing but a stallion in stiletto heels.
Can you picture that? I tried to paint it clear.
Space Age sex, 'bout to take us outta here.
Swag mixed with flavor, don't you like my swavor.
I'mma hit you right now then hit you later.
I gotta foreplay with ya all night shorty.
Straight put ya in the buck full dawg shorty.
Ladies stand up, throw ya hands up.
Futuristic loving, baby this the anthem.

Ricco Barrino talking.
Yeah.
It's another one.
Yung L.A.
It's ya boy, Puerto Ric.
Figured we could like smoke something.
You wanna get on my spaceship?
