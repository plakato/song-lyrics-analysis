Sans Red Lyrics
by Viza.

If I should see you again would your eyes follow mine.
If I touch you again would you manage to lose your mind.

We can let our hearts be broken or let nature take its course.

Sans Red. If you won't be there for me.
Sans Red. I will be there for you whenever you fall.
Whenever you fall.

If I kiss you again would your lips part from mine.
If I feel you again would your heart race like mine.

We can let our hearts be open or suffer through divorce.

Sans Red. If you won't wait for me.
Sans Red. I will await for you whenever you fall.
I will await for you.
I will await for you.

If this isn't the end then why are we still upset?
No, this isn't the end, no we shouldn't be holding back.

We can let our hearts be broken or let nature take its course.

I will await.
