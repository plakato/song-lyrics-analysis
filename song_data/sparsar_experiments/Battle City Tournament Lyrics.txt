Battle City Tournament Lyrics
by Xhoshi Cami.

Did you now about me no thats the fucking way i have ben i am a fucking bum.
and i live in a house with my mom but i now something about you when you where.
little you have gone to the private school what's the matter dawg? You.

This guy's a gangster? he's real name's Clarence haahhahahahah.
Fuck the beat i go acapella.
Fuck a dog fuck a clock fuck a trailer fuck everybody.
Fuck yall if you doubt me.
Im a piece of fucking white trash i say it proudly.
And fuck this battle i dont wanna win Im outty.
Here tell these people something they dont know about me.MOTHERFUCKER.
