Let Me Be the One Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Why must it always be so hard for you to see.
I think I've made it very clear.
And I can be the one to open up your heart.
If you believe in me, yeah.

I know you're doing things to try, try to hide.
But what you feel is much too strong, so don't fight it.
Together we were meant to be.
Eternally, so please, yeah.

Let me be the one.
Hold me tight , love me right, so right.
Let me be the one.
Hold me tight , love me right, so right.

I know you're doing things to try, try to hide.
But what you feel is much too strong, so don't you fight it.
Together we were meant to be.
Eternally, oh, please.

Cause when I look in your eyes.
I can see what you feel.
What we share is so special, it's real, oh, yeah.
Cause when I look in your eyes.
I can see what can be.
If you'd only give your love to me.

Oh, baby.
Why must it be so hard for you to see.
That my love for you is special, it's real.
You're always doing things to try to hide it.
But if it's meant to be, please baby, don't fight it.

Let me be the one.
Hold me tight , love me right, so right.
Let me be the one.
Hold me tight, love me right, so right.

Let me be the one.
Hold me tight , love me right, so right.
Let me be the one.
Hold me  tight, love me right, so right.

Let me be the one.
Hold me tight , love me right, so right.
Let me be the one.
Hold me tight , love me right, so right.
