Reel Shit Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


Uh, turn me up a lil' bit Noke.
Right there, it's going down feel that.

I'm on that real shit, that'll get you killed quick.
You about to find yourself, in some'ing you can't deal with.
Casualties we ain't taking names, cat niggas don't know the game.
Calicoes spit burning flames, never met one who can dodge my aim uh-huh.

D-Gotti.
I'm on some real shit, the type of shit you don't wanna deal with.
One of my closest dogs, is 'spose to loss a quarter million.
As I'm walking on bricks today time to participate, trying to get rich today.
Bet fa sho K to ride with the rifo', nigga I'm a pimp with a AK.
Break pay or I'ma break your face, slide through your block and take your.
change.
Don't hate me nigga hate my game, it's 2003 I'm trying to take my pay.
Fake I ain't I'll fuck you up, I'm a rude boy nigga upper cut.
Hop down whoop out the bumping bus, look what D-Gotti done done to us.
Picture pain with some strings in the game, that'll leave some suicide at the.
house.
Still I aim with a throw-away thang, bust brains 'fore I ever get caught.
Never get off cause I don't wanna blast, I don't wanna put a nigga under grass.
I don't wanna get the gun and mash, I don't wanna put a slug in ya ass.
Who knows what a nigga mad what a nigga said, what a nigga ain't had when a.
nigga doing bad.
What the fuck it do huh, now the motherfucker put him in a body bag.
Got it bad and prepare your funeral, pass by the way and do you bro.
You better think about the reprocussion, when you thinking about what you gon.
do to us.

A3.
A nigga gotta keep it on the real.
Cause cat niggas out here getting killed for the game.
Never change and remain the same I ain't playing.
For a life of what without scrill.
Who's to say the next day gon portray the way.
That if it's meant to stay then I'll still obey.
And everything's ok cause I continue to pray.
But sometimes a nigga click and get ready to spray.
You better move nigga get out the way.
Buck shots we'll open your face.
Blood splots dripping down your waist.
You ain't looking for trouble you best stay in your place.
I don't really bar what you heard.
The best thing for ya is to try to observe.
Niggas life fly by like the sack of a Nerf.
Too many souls been lost face down on the curb.
But is it hopeless knowing what I'm thinking when I wrote this.
Trying to cope see I never lose focus.
Noke and Nick I want a track they the dopest.
Out the back and jacking a strap only if provoked trick.
So baby do what just do.
But make sure whatever you do it fits you cause believe me fool.
Playing the game you will lose.
If you constantly trying to fill the next man's shoes.

Lil' Shay.
I'm on that real shit the type that'll make a nigga feel sick.
Take a nigga break a nigga real quick.
If you didn't know this the real deal bitch.
The calicoe gon spit them starching flames.
Leave a nigga stiff like starches mayn.
Never met another nigga that can dodge the aim.
Even a vest on ya chest couldn't dodge the rain, and I'm harder mayn.
Bo'guard the Charles Bark' when I'm toting the K.
Got the clip with cold chips hit the vertebrae.
Like a waiter all haters get served today.
And if you blocking my dogs you better get out the way.
Move calicoes stand on the scene.
My bullet ran out the beam you wanna be on my team.
Real thug niggas mash take that out the scene.
We'll leave ya six feet we'll shatter your dreams.

Say Wreck, I guess them niggas all ears.
So you can say what you wanna say mayn, you know I'm saying.
Or they comprehend one of those, but you niggas.
Been wondering what we on, that's right, Wreckshop baby.
