Dragon Spell Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

I'm still the king of the world.

I'll never fall to who's haunting my dreams.
I've still got control.
You are my enemies.
Cause you beg me for mercy.
Show no mercy.
Show no mercy.

I've fought for this kingdom.
I'll take all of that is mine.
I'll bring the war on the enemies.
If you want me, I'm right here.

I gave everything.
Everything that I have.
There's always a war within me.
I never let it show, I'll never let my family down.
Fight for what you stand for.

If you fight and die of those inductions.
What was the meaning of it now.
I have too much riding on me.
To be the man I was born to be.

This is a family.
We won't gravel at the face of our enemies.
Or our families.
This is a family.
We won't gravel at the face of our enemies.
This is a family.
Don't fuck with family.

We won't fall.
I will not ever let this kingdom fall.

I gave everything.
Everything that I have.
There's always a war within me.
I never let it show.
I'll never let my family down.
Fight for what you stand for.

If you were me.
Would you switch on what you've known?
My sacrifice.
My sacrifice.

I'm never giving up.
For those I love.
My sacrifice.
My sacrifice.

Your dreams have come to an end.
Because this was mine and I won't give in.
Your dreams have come to an end.
Because this was mine and I won't give in.

Your dreams have come to an end.

I'll never lose sight of what I believe.
I'll fight for my friends, my family.

We won't fall.

I gave everything.
Everything that I have.
There's always a war within me.
I never let it show, I'll never let my family down.
Fight for what you stand for.

If you were me.
Would you switch on what you've known?
My sacrifice.
My sacrifice.

I'm never giving up.
For those I love.
My sacrifice.
My sacrifice.

I'm still the king of the world.
I'm still the king of the world.
