So Long To The Red River Valley Lyrics
by Quebe Sisters.


So long to the Red River Valley.
Our ropin' and wranglin' is through.
And so farewell to the home corral.
And all the old friends that we knew.
Goodbye to the old empty bunkhouse.
Where we dream the hours away.
Send our mail to the end of the trail.
So long to the Red River Valley.

I'll roll up my beddin' and pack up my clothes.
And lighten my heart with a song.
For where I'll be travelin', nobody knows.
So I'll have to be movin' a long.

Ludi, ludi, ludi, ludi.
