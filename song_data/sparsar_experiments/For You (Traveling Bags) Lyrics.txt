For You (Traveling Bags) Lyrics
by Wolf Rider.


Threw away my traveling bags.
No longer longer do I miss my past.
What's the difference if it's all.
If I'm just throwing away myself.

I laid it all out on the line.
And left my baggage all behind.
Still I'm burning up inside.
But I won't go without a fight.

I would've given anything for you.
But anything just won't do.
And that place you keep running to.
Is like a glass house with no views.

**.

For you.
I've been up, I've been down, I've been everywhere around.
