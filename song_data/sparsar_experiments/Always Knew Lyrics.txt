Always Knew Lyrics
by Russ.

Produced by Russ.

Always knew I had to put in work.
Always knew that this was gonna work.
Always knew that I'd bring home the bands.
Always knew that I'd become the man.
I always knew that second guessing.
Was the opposite of truth.
I bet my future on my faith.
And let myself do what I do.
Now my gambles looking like.
They weren't gambles after all.
I always knew, I always knew.
Yeah, I always knew.

Made your girl bring the hoe out.
Lotta' people tryna get in contact.
Lotta' people tryna get a contract.
Cause they want my name on a X.
I ain't gonna' lie yeah I think about my ex.
I ain't gonna' lie yeah I think about the checks.
I ain't gonna' lie yeah I think I got next.
Always been the one my fam' turned to.
Skeptics Imma' convert you.
Give your girl something she can twerk to.
I always knew what rap star perks do.
Always knew they'd all start callin'.
Always knew I'd have a lotta' options.
Always knew the money was a sure thing.
Always knew I'd make the whole world sing.

Always knew I had to put in work.
Always knew that this was gonna work.
Always knew that I'd bring home the bands.
Always knew that I'd become the man.
I always knew that second guessing.
Was the opposite of truth.
I bet my future on my faith.
And let myself do what I do.
Now my gambles looking like.
They weren't gambles after all.
I always knew, I always knew.
Yeah, I always knew.

Refrain: Russ.
Always knew I couldn't trust nobody.
Always knew I had to trust myself.
Always knew they'd try and call me cocky.
Always knew they didn't love themselves.

Back in Atlanta and I'm workin'.
Always knew it'd paid off to be observant.
Always knew I'd end up in a car with curtains.
Always knew I'd elevate to a new version.
Of my self.
2.0.
These shots so strong feel the recoil.
Who's loyal?
I don't need two hands.
Same ones I came in with.
Oo-yeah.

Always knew I had to put in work.
Always knew that this was gonna work.
Always knew that I'd bring home the bands.
Always knew that I'd become the man.
I always knew that second guessing.
Was the opposite of truth.
I bet my future on my faith.
And let myself do what I do.
Now my gambles looking like.
They weren't gambles after all.
I always knew, I always knew.
Yeah, I always knew.
