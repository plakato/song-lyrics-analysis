If Ever Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.


There's someone in love with you, you know.
Just don't wanna let that feeling show.
Because they're not sure that you could ever feel the same.
But now he would like to take a chance.
In hopes that you both will find romance.
In case you are willing.
There's something I'd like you to know.

Girl, if ever you call me.
I'm there for you girl, right or wrong.
I'm telling you now girl.
If ever you need me.
I promise you I'll give you my all.

Someone who will love and sacrifice.
Who knows what it means to treat you right.
Someone who won't change his mind.
But always feels the same.
He wants you to open up your heart.
In hopes that true love might one day start.
Girl if you are willing.
There's something I'd like you to know.

Darling here's my heart.
Please take care my darling dear.
Cos I... I do.. Love you... It's true.
And I hope that you are willing girl to love me in return.
And if you are.
I want you to know.
