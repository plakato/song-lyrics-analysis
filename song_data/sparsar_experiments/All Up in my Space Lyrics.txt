All Up in my Space Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.

D-Gotti.
I ain't doing it, for no bullshit.
But I'm in this bitch strapped if you gon die, you know I'ma pull quick.
Could hit a innocent bystander, but naw.
I'm pointing at the motherfucker, with the foul mouth.
And y'all, niggas ain't nothing but hoes.
Now just take it like a man, or get chased out the do'.
Hit you everywhere but under your toes, under your clothes.
Bleeding like a broad, on her cy-cycle.
Beefing with a phsyco, about a soft blood.
Outline in chalk, is the only outcome.
How come you think, that y'all run sales.
Couldn't get them niggas heaven, so I brought some hell.
Oh well, shouldn't of been up in my space.
Wasn't my fault he wasn't ducking, shouldn't up been up in my face.
Misplaced slugs, all up in a playa body.
Was like the roof on fire, flames slugs from the shotty.
And uh D-Gotti, not the one for those games.
But if you wanna make the news, you won't play see I'm saying nigga.

Get on, 'fore you get shitted on.
Stay up in your place, if you wanna live long.
Why you all up in my space, why you all up in my space.
Nigga better back-back, 'fore I catch another case.

D-Reck.
Thoed in the game, like a pass from Vick.
Hustling hard for the cash, got the grip with car tricks.
The name D-Reck, but they call me Johnny Street.
So in the gutter shuffling butter, is where you find me.
At it 2-4-7, for that payday baby.
Niggas think I fell off, cause they ain't seen me lately.
Bitch niggas talk down, then see me forget they hate me.
The Glock work daily first, then come congratulate me.
Sticks and stones, might break my bones.
Bitch lip got zipped, won't hurt me.
Cause if your name ain't in they mouth, then you ain't getting paid.
And that's the only type of shit, that gets me worried.
But my personal space mayn, belongs to me.
And if you don't know my real name, I need three feet.
And even if you do, and you ain't my boo.
Man to man conversations, I still gotta get too.
Invading a nigga space, get your ass erased.
I protect my perimeter, with this heat around my waist.

A3.
Don't try to play me for weak, cause homie ain't no mercy for strangers.
Find a clip in your chest, and your best friend strangled.
I'm a Dead End G, keep it I-N-C.
And what I don't see, is you trying me.
Everytime a nigga stomp, I crack the concrete.
Niggas getting mad, cause I jump in the front seat.
Look don't mess with me, I ain't scared to show ya.
Get leaned on hard, by a nigga that's sober.
Hey, you in my space violation from the jump.
You a match lit, nigga I'm a loaded fuel pump.
So don't get close, I got soldiers at they post.
That'll twist you over fire, like a pig getting roast.
We warn niggas fairly, that shots reloaded.
Blitz hard on the one, got the ball and sewed it.
You had a good chance, but it's clear you blowed it.
So that cash that you past nigga, watch me fold it.

Dirty $.
Man you only as smart, as your last dumb move.
You think of fucking with me, could get your body numb dude.
Not too smart, see I'll make you heart.
Do the opposite of start, test that S on your chest.
Cock back, and make a mess of your flesh yes.
Original dickie boy, we the best of the best.
So if you suckers hold plex, and you eager to express it.
Bring it on get shitted on, we well protected.
Dollar well connected, plugged in to these streets.
Better get up out my face, or catch a slug from the heat.
Ain't nothing sweet, bout how I hold my gun.
Wig splitter my nigga, I squeeze triggas for fun.
Mr. Dirty $, still pop the collar.
Making hoe ass niggas holla, breaking em off some'ing proper.
Shots and shots, please spread the news.
Got these fools so patient, working with a very short fuse.
Brother excuse me, naw get out the way.
I'm a grown ass man, fam scram go play yeah.
