In Too Deep Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


P.K 
Yeah ... .P. Killer, ..., ..L-O-X, ..., .Ruff, Ryders, 
, 
Styles, 
Holiday Styles, catdaddy. Show me the green 
And. If not show me the work show me the fiends 
I be writing in the week cause. I know the routine 
Pardon, you light grey off the marteen 
Nickel. The wheels used to have to whistle for sales 
And now I cop work every tip of the scales 
And. I can make money for bait sittin' in jail 
Walk by the C.O. hittin', an L 
Ayyo. This is for the industry, consider it rep 
I'll dis, any nigga. You name you give me a check: 
Old school new school, hungry nigga, not signed 
He ain't, saying shit. If he ain't talking with a Glock nine 
Please, don't call the cops 
We got beef, then the shells will pop I'm tryin' to hit you while you park 
Hop in push you over. Take it up the block 
But. I know the jakes is coming ya. Man'S a snitch 
Wakes is comin', so start getting candles lit 
I'mma, show you how the hustlers handle shit 
I'll crack your head, like a customer with grams and spliff 
Family shit, but ain't no picnics involved just a trip to the zoo 
Dressed in all brown, with a Banger in your shoe 
In too deep in the yard, with a thousand niggas, just like you, cocksucker 
 
Jadakiss, 
A thousand niggas, just like you, 
Narcs is trying to crack down. Coke went back down 
It's hard to get green, but everybody got brown. 
They know I got the China for 15 in the diner 
20 after 12. In the building see the minors 
Martega massacare 
You run around buying bundles. I get eggs from Africa 
Burn the block for a year, then I'm stashin' ya and snatch the truck 
Free bile with half the dutch 
While. They got you on the wall, I'm crackin' up 

When. They ask you. If you wan na cut them a deal that send you bookin' 
In the bullpen, with dopeheads and niggas from Brooklyn 
You scared to move another nigga, wearin' ya, jewels 
By, the time you get upstairs. He wearin' ya shoes, 
Got, the blood cane yettas and niggas, with the coofys 
In, the dayroom blowin' each other, like Lucys 
Matter, how big you are or strong. You are 
Right or wrong. You all get along with star 
Just toe to toe with you with the cannon in your face: 
Motherfuck lappin'. Here'S a stare to face -- BLAW, 
, 
Sheek overlapping last line. 
Sheek got niggas that'll cover his tracks when he walkin' in mud, 
And use gats, with no noise when he dealin' with blood 
But. They bounce to one bone to the next, like bitches 
Hole, small enough to use band-aids no stiches, 
Everything's eternal from my life to my journal, 
It's deeper than secrets, government keepin' 
So bounce with me. If you don't wan na fall on the weekend, 
Or die the weekend. Literally, fly off the beacon, 
Talk slick and get send somethin' quick, 
Only nigga hard enough to look up to me is my dick 
My clique, the boss. We don't take no loss 
When, we flow the whole room smell like tobasco, sauce 
Come in your crib, with something hot dead in your brain 
And watch your family jump around like the House of Pain, 
All, the numbers takin' off my Benz, no name 
Just tints on The window, so you can't see through 
While my gun, is at your face. Like Peek-a-boo 
I'm teasin', you like an invisible string 
Tied to a bag of money when your reach I'll pull 
Clip hard to stay full nigga, we in too deep 
I rock niggas to sleep. Like a Jew, I'm too cheap 
Fuck, a car show
