1994 Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Quasimoto.
Let me take you on a Quasimoto rhyme.
ride.
Saturday night, puffin herb, got the.
vibe.
8 miles high, got your imagination.
At a fragmentary state, Lord Quas the great for God.
sakes.
If you're lookin' for some beats you gotta see my man Madlib,.
heh.
Enter in the palace, we roll wide like a.
chalice.
Tascam villains, gonna hurt your.
feelin's.
If you're stompin' with that wack then we must.
highjack.
Keep the rap real with the Raw Addict format.

Madlib.
All up in this shit it's Madlib the Bad.
Kid.
Droppin' high shit in fashion in the lab.
again.
Here, droppin' raw heat, the raw shit,.
that Aw shit!, the Quick Draw Mcgraw.
shit.
Steppin' in the right direction for.
selection.
Perfection, get in you like a musical.
injection.
On some shit like we in 1994, with the high-top fades and the beats were.
mighty raw.
Like....

Quasimoto.
I speak no evil, hear no evil.
Seek no evil, have no fear.
It's a 388 waitin' for your departure.
The last time I got you fought you tried to make the.
escape.
You're only out for the papes, disrespectin' those who paved the way.
Think you better parlay.

Madlib.
Find another way.

Quasimoto.
While I light another jay.

Madlib.
Hey.
Ill mathematic static, slick rappers I let 'em have.
it.
While I bust a rhythmatic __.
Dig the crates, make the papes, shake, annihilate your fate.
Didn't even know you blew your face with.
hate.
When y'all on the mic, you can tell that y'all some.
suckas.
Duck this, cuz I'll I see you do is butt kiss.
_smooch_.

Quasimoto.
Better than ever so we go for the gold.

Madlib.
Supernova.

Quasimoto.
You out cold.

Madlib.
While the story unfold.

_So prepare your mind for my lifeline....
Some MCs act bold and arrogant.
Vain and using each other to compete with.
These subjects I pity.
Cause their rhymes are not witty like.
mine_.
