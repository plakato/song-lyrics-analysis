Train Of Thought Lyrics
by Uno Hype.


Everybody's listenin'.
Everybody's talkin'.
They sayin' that they run it, I seen them niggas joggin'.
Homie kept balkin', telling me that he ballin'.
Them lies, never bought 'em.
Hype is what they sure called him.
Big homie passin' the ball.
Best believe I caught it.
Trying hard to see me fallin'.
Tell em to stop hackin' the ref ain't call it keep on playin' my road.
They settin' picks on my row.
I'mma drive straight to get to my goal.
My path glittered in gold.
Young nigga still rocking these shows.
Plus I'm hot with the flow, plottin' to blow.
Just the beginning of my plans, plus we doin' what we can.
Fuck boy stuck in the jam, mind spinning like a fan.
Plus I'm going to a man, I gotta keep livin'.
I gotta keep writing these images a nigga spit it.
Knowing I ain't lived it.
Tell 'em meet me at the finish line I'm already there like give me mine.
Dawg we finna shine, just more waitin'.
Fuck being patient until them I'mma keep blazin'.
Since my train of thought racing whole jays I face em.
The whole scene changin', once homie start cakin'.
Shit we started in the basement, now shit be all gravy.
The life be all crazy, the bud be outrageous.
Look honey don't play me, I don't know why you niggas hate me.
Just watch how long it take me, I kill in-season  rabies.
But really I'm just lazy, chillin' in our take 3.
But I kept going and showing the grind potent.
To Nicki, my mind don't get why time floatin'.
Mind blowin', living out my dream this shit is mind-blowing.
I can't blow this shot, I only got one in my life.
I brought my heart, you bought a knife.
Should we go numb it with ice.
Young niggas we just doing it right.
We be the dudes you was doin' it like.
Word of advice is open your eyelids and look at a young nigga just doing it.
right.
Moves through the night and I kill em all since they was moving the light.
Put 'em in alignment, lock me in confinement.
But you don't know what grind is, you gotta put the time in.
But don't remind me I might put 'em on silent.
Rip 'em apart them leave your brains to dry, kid.
Kickin' it like Tribe did, I don't see you ahead of us.
I just keep calm, I do not see no competitors.
Move to the next lane, I'mma push the pedal up.
Movin' like a ???, they all the way in the back.
Since all they do is tap for this and that, that pitter pat.
I'm in the front, light a L to relax nigga.
