Buying A Lie Lyrics
by UNKLE.

Lee Gorton :.

I didn't know what I never like.
His looking at me like you have something to hide.
If I would have said I would have known.
You're trying to run while I'm trying to grow.

How does it feel are you dying inside.
Trying to cover up, these's no reply.

I don't know what you know.
I don't know what you know.
I wanna say what every knows.
You're buying the lie but you're selling your soul.
Why would you say you want us to lose.

You're looking at me but you see what you choose.
Cause I don't agree with everyone else.
You're changing the rules.
But you're cheating yourself.

I don't know what you know.
Though I know why the wind blows cold on you.

Sloping away and I'm sure you're inside.
I have nothing to lose and nothing to hide.
Too many people living alone.
Take a look at yourself.
And then check what you know.

How does it feel are you dying inside.
Trying to cover up, these's no reply.
I don't know what you know.
I don't know what you know.

I gotta feeling that you're looking to find.
May be some kind of meaning.
But I have nothing in mind.
Why would you side with anyone else.
When you're figuring out.
What you're thinking yourself.

How will you learn when.
You don't want to know.
How does it feel to.
Believing in everything you're told.

I don't know what you know.
Though I know why the wind blows cold on you.
