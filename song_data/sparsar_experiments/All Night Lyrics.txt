All Night Lyrics
by Swollen Members.


Yeah, this is Swollen Members, c'mon.
Another Battle Axe banger.
Breaking out the heat, showing you what's really going on.
C'mon.

Don't stop.Make it last all night.
Hey Ma, what's really good.Shake your ass all night.
C'mon get in the ride.Drive fast all night.
She already got a girl.That's all right.

What up ma, you wanna hang with a rock star.
Hop into my truck get stopped by a cop car.
How does this suppose to get.
Seems like the police, they don't like my associates.
We some monsters is concert.
Drunk in the middle of the club like Who wants it!?
Mass appeal with massive whips, bling-bling.
Drunk with a belt buckle in the motorcycle ring king.
Brand new breed creep for vengeance.
Bad muscle car with TV's and chromed out engines.
Fucking models and smashing glass bottles.
Full blown, no helmet, full throttle.
Rein stone cowboy desperado.
Underground to winning the rap lotto.
Now MadChild's talking about cash, son of a bitch.
I was just broke before its more fun being rich.

Yo ma you so raw, hotter than Soul La.
I like so far, dancing with no bra.
Show me where them hands are, reaching for my keys.
Its cool we can roll we do everything in three's.
Four go with them, two come with me.
Pound it like a drum see how fun it can be.
Got pull like a monster truck, at the crib.
Do watch the fuck this is life live it up.
Case closed but there's more for later.
Pushing her buttons like Space Invaders.
My whole pack is tattooed in black like villains.
We can bounce tonight but tomorrow don't catch feelings.

Bounce, Rock, Drink, Smoke, Do whatever.
Can't stop get more of this cheddar.
Don't you love it when a plan comes together.
Doing big things spending more of this cheddar.

I hear them say glorious how it must feel.
We coming through rolling on rims bigger than bus wheels.
And plus skill that's a total package.
You scared like airplanes and exploding.
That's the size of the damage we do, no amateur crew.
Taking care of business like a manager do.
Hey! Rhymes knowing how I'm so fantastic.
When I bend it and smack it, just ask the last chick.
The beat will knock them like a brick to the head.
It's Moka O. and if you don't know, I'm sick in the head.
Ripping it that's why I'm flipping the bread.
I got your neck knotted like a bitch addicted to head.
