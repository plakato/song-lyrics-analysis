Legion of Doom Lyrics
by Big Season Muzik.


I'm one of the infamous warriors.
Killing niggas with rhymes like Gladiator.
Y'all rappers is on that wack shit.
Wearing skinny jeans, I wear that baggy shit.
These wanna-be trap niggas are hilarious.
Watch out, my rhymes not fast, but they furious.
I'm the beast, king of the jungle.
Like Mike Buffer, let's get ready to rumble.
Slam emcees like Rampage Jackson.
Killin' it, time for some action.
In the cypher, stay on my grind.
Everyday, I focus, rhymes on my mind.
Niggas mean mugging, when they see me.
Real talk, you know who I be.
Since one of you niggas step in the room.
Welcome to the LEGION OF DOOM.

These motherfuckas don't know who I am.
These fake niggas don't know who I run.
These punk bitches don't know who I do.
I'm a road warrior, I run LEGION OF DOOM.
These motherfuckas don't know who I am.
These fake niggas don't know who I run.
These punk bitches don't know who I do.
I'm a road warrior, I run LEGION OF DOOM.

SWAG means Secretly We Are Gay, that ain't me.
Record companies try to change me for the industry.
Tight clothes, other shit, what's the deal.
Call me Inspector Gadget, cause I keep it real.
Y'all wack emcess think y'all sick.
If you really are, suck my dick.
Get your own style and do your own shit.
That's why I think, write my own shit.
Beats explodes like a disaster.
That's why they call me General Beatmaster.
Not dissing the music, love the South.
If you wack, you better close your mouth.
Telling the truth about hip-hop.
Rapping over the same shit need to stop.
Since y'all niggas step into the room.
Welcome to the LEGION OF DOOM.

These motherfuckas don't know who I am.
These fake niggas don't know who I run.
These punk bitches don't know who I do.
I'm a road warrior, I run LEGION OF DOOM.
These motherfuckas don't know who I am.
These fake niggas don't know who I run.
These punk bitches don't know who I do.
I'm a road warrior, I run LEGION OF DOOM.
These motherfuckas don't know who I am.
These fake niggas don't know who I run.
These punk bitches don't know who I do.
I'm a road warrior, I run LEGION OF DOOM.
These motherfuckas don't know who I am.
These fake niggas don't know who I run.
These punk bitches don't know who I do.
I'm a road warrior, I run LEGION OF DOOM.
