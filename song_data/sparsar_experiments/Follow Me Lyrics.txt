Follow Me Lyrics
by Virtue.


There was a time when I was trying to fight on my own.
Thinking that I was strong enough to get through it alone.
But when problems piled up heavily burdening me.
I called on him he stepped in and saved me mercifully.

Pre-lude.
When I think of all he's done to be closer to me it's overwhelming just to.
think.
To think he gave his life for you and me yeah.
Is more than enough to persuade me all he ask was.

All he asked was follow me so I gladly go.
Cause he's the one who carries me when I can't take no more oh.
Everytime you see me you don't really know that.
My father is who you see working through me so just know.

By his grace alone I'm livin' to see brighter days.
And with his light I know he directs me in all of my ways.
Always here with me faithful friend never leaving my side.
Don't know where I'd be without him truth be told and that's why.

Pre-lude.

He's my life , gives me life , he who strengthens me, is in fact who you see,.
cause he working in me, never once failed a soul, who truly believed, the.
living proof is me, i'm just one of many.
