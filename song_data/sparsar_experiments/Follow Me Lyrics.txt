Follow Me Lyrics
by Virtue.


There was a time when I was trying to fight on my own 
Thinking that I was strong enough to get through it alone, 
But, when problems piled up heavily burdening me 
I called on him. He stepped in and saved me mercifully, 
 
Pre-lude 
When. I think of all he's done to be closer to me. It'S overwhelming just to
think 
To think he gave his life for you and me yeah 
Is more than enough to persuade me all he ask was 
 
All. He asked was follow me, so I gladly go 
Cause he's the one who carries me when I can't take no more. Oh 
Everytime, you see me, you don't really know that 
My father is who you see working through me. So just know: 
 
By his grace alone. I'M livin' to see brighter days 
And with his light. I know he directs me in all of my ways, 
Always here with me, faithful friend, never leaving my side. 
Don'T know where I'd be without him. Truth be told, and that's why 
 
Pre-lude 
 
He's my life gives me life. He who strengthens me is in fact who you see 
cause. He working in me. Never once failed a soul who truly believed the
living proof is me, i'm just one of many
