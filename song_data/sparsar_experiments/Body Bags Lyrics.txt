Body Bags Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.


Homicide in the air, put on a red flag.
Shoot him in the head, put him in a bodybag.
One shot kill, put him in a body bag.
Zip! Lift 'em, now he in a bodybag.
Put him in a bodybag, he in a bodybag.
Zip! Lift 'em, now he in a bodybag.

Wooh Da Kid.
Homicide in the air smell like a graveyard.
Six niggas extinct for tryna play hard.
Red pitbull tough with the lockjaw.
Bullets maneater so we call him Carnivore.
You know it's rude love to the OG's shoffy.
Blood love to my Brem niggas like.
Jaffy.
I be like piano keys.
They be like, what's that?
First the white Sheet.
Then come the Bodybag.
Coroners ride next, it's a long ride.
He died real quick, and he died with his pride.
No pain.
No itch.
Put him in a black bag.
ZIP!

Waka Flocka Flame.
Oh shit, what the fuck?!
This nigga wanna buck?
Pistol-whip this fuck nigga till his eye bust.
Make the paramedics rush.
Matter-fact DOA.
I'm that guy, I'm that man.
I'm the crazy nigga with the Kay.
It's goin down.
Shoot his ass up - ZIP!
Now he in a bodybag, police hit the scene, zip em - don't say shit!
They gone ask you.
What happened? Who got shot? Who done fired shots?
Reply back:.
I ain't see jack shit! I ain't sayin' shit! I ain't no snitch, matter-fact it was Waka Flocka, ZIP!
Dumb nigga.
I told you.
Don't snitch on Waka Flocka.
Soo Woo.
