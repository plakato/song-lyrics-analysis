by The X-Ecutioners.

I was in this club just the other day.
And I saw the X-ecutioners that made me wanna say:.
They were cuttin' it up, scratchin' it with both hands.
They sounded so good they made everybody dance..

Scratching yes vocal..

As the 'X' kept fading, they were rockin' the crowd.
Everybody was movin' to the hypnotic sound.
They were cuttin' it up, scratchin' it with both hands.
They sounded so good they made everybody dance..

Scratching I love this song vocal..

The music was hittin', the bass kept pumpin'.
Nobody was sittin', 'X' got the whole club jumpin'.

It was Rob Swift, Total Eclipse, Roc Raida.
Tearin' it up, yeah, flippin' the crossfader.

Scratching like this, yeah vocals..

They were cuttin' it up, scratchin' it with both hands.
They sounded so good they made everybody dance..

The music was hittin', the bass kept pumpin'.
Nobody was sittin', 'X' got the whole club jumpin'.

It was Rob Swift, Total Eclipse, Roc Raida.
Tearin' it up, yeah, flippin' the crossfader.

Scratching turn it up, blow, come on vocals..

By the end of the night, the whole vibe felt right.
Yeah, the X-ecutioners made the music sound tight.

It was Rob Swift, Total Eclipse, Roc Raida.
Tearin' it up, yeah, flippin' the crossfader.

Scratching X-ecutioners, like this vocals..
