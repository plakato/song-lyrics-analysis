Born Naked Lyrics
by RuPaul.


Who you waitin' for? Another savior.
Always lookin' but you never find, never find.
Wakin' up from another night gone.
Always lookin' but you never find, never find.

RuPaul &amp; Clairy Browne.
Goin' downtown, you know where you goin'.
Throw ya top down like you know where you goin'.
Tell me one thing, do you like where ya goin'?
Runnin' all the red lights.

RuPaul &amp; Clairy Browne.
And I said, oooh.
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now.
We're all born naked and the rest is drag.

Who? Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now.
We're all born naked and the rest is drag.

A lonely highway, you drove the wrong way.
Always chasin' down a fantasy, a fantasy.
A sexy muscle car under the radar.
Always lookin' but you never see, never see.

RuPaul &amp; Clairy Browne.
Goin' downtown, you know where you goin'.
Throw ya top down like you know where you goin'.
Tell me one thing, do you like where ya goin'?
Ignoring all of the signs.

RuPaul &amp; Clairy Browne.
And I said, oooh.
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now.
We're all born naked and the rest is drag.

Who? Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now.
We're all born naked and the rest is drag.

I'll say it again.
It's never been the clothes that make the man.
Nothing can.
Leave all ya baggage behind.

RuPaul &amp; Clairy Browne.
And I said, oooh.
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now.
We're all born naked and the rest is drag.

Who? Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now.
We're all born naked and the rest is drag x2.

Let me tell you the truth!
Who do you think you are?
I'm telling the truth now.
We're all born naked and the rest is drag.

Spoken: Shirley Q. Liquor.
Talkin' 'bout you are born naked and the rest is drags.
Shit!
