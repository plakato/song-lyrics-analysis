100% Hater Proof Lyrics
by The Unit.


When I come through in the drop, why they lookin' surprised?
There they go again, them haters.
And I can tell that they hatin' from the look in their eyes.
There they go again, them haters.
And I can tell from the stares when they look at my team.
There they go again, them haters.
They admirin' the jewels and they notice the gleam.
There they go again, them haters.

I'm sittin' here tryin' to figure out, is it your job to ride dick?
Or you just don't like me and wanna hate on Rah shit.
Or you really don't know what you doin'.
But you just doin' what you usually be doin'.
You a hater, it comes naturally.
I'm on some Mary Blige shit, no hater way.
Yo hater way, get your ass kicked like a 8 away.

In Hollywood with Queen Lah, can't hate on my shit.
23s on the Caddy, can't hate on my whip, c'mon.

Is it because I don't need music to get money, y'all hate me?
Or you mad cuz I been eatin' since y'all was babies?
I'ma grown ass woman, quit playin', haters all in my biz.
Prayin' that Dana won't do it again.
What you mad cuz I been holdin' it down with Shakim?
And you switch managers every year but still they not him.
We got TV on lock down, whole Unit hot now.
Billboard Number 1, I'm claimin' my spot now.

Yo they see the way I move in the drop.
I cruise through the stop sign, movin' through ya block.
My shoes and my watch, I'm Gucci to the socks.
Y'all niggas hate me.
I'm cool and I'm hot, chain feel like AC.
Basically none can wit' P, you stuck in three.
I'm fifth gear, locked man wrist wear.
Shit yeah, demolishin' the game.
But don't worry, I plan to retire in six years.

Another day, time pass baby, y'all still hatin', it's all good.
It's my turn, I'm takin', but cousin, it's still hood.
Money ain't change shit except the jewels and the whips.
The zeroes at the end of my deposit slips.
I'm still street, it's in me, don't force it outta me.
Cuz when I street sweep the heat swing rapidly.
Life's so- I just learned when no one gimme shit.
I struggle to burn to earn this life.

Playa bench, listen.
Haters with no money, they see me, it's so funny.
I start fillin' six, start throwin' up money.
Ballin', yo I'm addicted, I just can't stop.
When the cops yell Freeze I show 'em the watch.
Then I hop out the drop and there ain't no beef.
Ice grillin' all the time, I got platinum teef.
Now everybody hollerin' Louis 13th.
And I don't mean to toot my own horn but beep beep.

They 'magine the donuts and I get crazier cash.
Leave 'em sleepin' wit' the fishes like Hanks and the splash.
Hate the size of the watch and the way that it flash.
Hey buddy, look out front, that's a Jag for you ass.
I'm talkin' the whole nine, wood grain in the dash.
And honest, you can get the whole nine, talk trash.
Rappers get ate fast, and when I say ate fast.
I mean pullin' the pistol and givin' 'em 8 fast.

100% hater proof.
100% hater proof.
100% hater proof.
