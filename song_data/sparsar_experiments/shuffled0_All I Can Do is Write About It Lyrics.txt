All I Can Do is Write About It Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young.
I can see the concrete slowly creeping.

Lord take me and mine before that comes.
All I can do is write 'em in a song.
But you'll never take ol' Dixie from a boy.

Well there just ain't no place like home.

I can see the concrete slowly creeping.
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times.


Well you better listen to my song.
Because I can see the concrete slowly creeping.
Well this life that I've lead has took me everywhere.
Lord take me and mine before that comes.
All I can do is write 'em in a song.
I'm not trying to put down no big cities.
Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowing.
There ain't no place I ain't never gone.
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathing.
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog.
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee.

Lord take me and mine before that comes.
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina.
Or a fish in a river swimming free.
And Lord I can't make any changes.
And Lord I can't make any changes.
But the things they write about us is just a bore.
Well you can take a boy out of ol' Dixieland.
