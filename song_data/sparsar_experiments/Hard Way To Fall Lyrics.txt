Hard Way To Fall Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

See all the rain on the street.
The way the cars shine.
And the scotch that she drinks.
With her lips so fine.
And her shoulders go weak.
As she closes her eyes.
Oh my God, when she was mine.

See how she moves through the door.
How she loses her keys.
How she loses her cool.
Watching blackbirds scatter through the trees.
How she flips from the back to the front.
Reading magazines.
Oh my God, I miss those things.

And it's a hard way to fall.
And this ain't the easy way down.
It's a hard thing to love anyone, anyhow.

So if it's gotta be you.
Treat her nice.
Hold her hand.
And tell her twice.
That she doesn't have to worry.
And it'll be alright.
It's alright this time.
It's alright this time.

See her smiling at him.
That used to be me.
I could find her in a thunderstorm.
Just by the way that the rain would fall.
And we used to be something.
But somethin' happened to me.
Oh my God, when I was free.

And it's a hard way to fall.
And this ain't the easy way down.
And it's a hard thing to love anyone, anyhow.

And it's a hard way to fall.
And this ain't the easy way down.
And it's a hard thing to love anyone, anyhow.
