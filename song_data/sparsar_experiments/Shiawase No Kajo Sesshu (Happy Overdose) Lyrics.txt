Shiawase No Kajo Sesshu (Happy Overdose) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Slit her throat,watch her die slow.
She eatin' pills cause i like to watch her overdose.
She on the floor takin' in the last breath.
I'm in the yard, diggin' graves til she dead.
Put some flowers on her chest, shut both her eyes, give her one last kiss.
Too many bodies, yards gettin' crowded.
Too many lights, goin' searchin' and I hope they find me.

I sit back and smoke my wraps, time goin' slow but the weed burnin' fast.
x2.

Everytime i hit the club Im smokin' weed.
All my niggas smokin' and you know we dream.
Pourin' hella acid nigga , I'ont sleep.
Nigga I'ont sleep, Im up trynna get some money.
Everytime I see a hoe that bitch act funny.
Cause she already know I need all her money.
Imma rob my bitch, then Imma rob my hoe.
Nigga I'm a motherfuckin' pimp on the low.
And you ain't even know, and that's yo hoe, nigga let her go.
You think you hers, she think she yours.
Nigga y'all wrong, this her thong.
It's in my room, I'm in yo bitch, yo bitch on me, I ain't even say shit.
She walk to me, she said hello.
I said hello, bitch get on the floor.

I said twerk, if you trynna eat good, bitch x3.
Make some money hoe, make some money bitch.
