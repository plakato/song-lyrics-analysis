123 Praise! (Remix) Lyrics
by Virtue.


 Praise 
 
I, said: hey you, we gon na switch styles, 
'Cuz ain't nothin' wrong with dancin' a while 
'Cuz we be gettin down praisin' him all the while 
And. We can't stop until somebody shouts 
, Whether there's two or three in this place, 
There's just enough to give him praise 
So. When I tell you 
Lift you hands and act the fool 
 
It's time for a praise party: 
We ain't hatin': nobody 
Lift your hands, understaind. What we're here for 
Clap your hands, understand what we're here for 
If. You know he's worthy 
Go ahead, give him glory, 
Lift your hands, understaind. What we're here for 
Clap your hands, understand what we're here for 
 
Everybody tell somebody 
We gon na party 
Let's get started. 
 Praise 
 
Hey, you get out my way. 
I'Ve been tryna, give praise all day 
So. If you ain't tryna, do it just. Let me know 
'Cuz I can do by myself and that's fo' sho' 
Ooh and that's my word. 
All I need is space and his word 
And. I don't care who's lookin' at me. 
'Cuz God is good and he's good to me. Hey 
, 
Ad-Libs Karima 
4x, It's not about the games. It'S just all about the praise tonight. 
 
Rap,
