123 Praise! (Remix) Lyrics
by Virtue.


Praise!

I said, hey, you , we gonna switch styles.
'Cuz ain't nothin' wrong with dancin' a while.
'Cuz we be gettin down praisin' him all the while.
And we can't stop until somebody shouts.
Whether there's two or three in this place.
There's just enough to give him praise.
So when I tell you.
Lift you hands and act the fool.

It's time for a praise party.
We ain't hatin' nobody.
Lift your hands understaind what we're here for.
Clap your hands understand what we're here for.
If you know he's worthy.
Go ahead give him glory.
Lift your hands understaind what we're here for.
Clap your hands understand what we're here for.

Everybody tell somebody.
We gonna party.
Let's get started.
Praise.

Hey you, get out my way.
I've been tryna give praise all day.
So if you ain't tryna do it just let me know.
'Cuz I can do by myself and that's fo' sho'.
Ooh, and that's my word.
All I need is space and his word.
And I don't care who's lookin' at me.
'Cuz God is good and he's good to me, hey.

Ad-Libs - Karima.
4x It's not about the games it's just all about the praise tonight.

Rap.
