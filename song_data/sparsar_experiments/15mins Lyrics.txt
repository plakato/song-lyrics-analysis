15mins Lyrics
by Zubz.

Reprise: Zubz Singing.

Everybody gets their moment.
Everybody has their time.
15mins in the spotlight.
That's all they get to blow your mind.
If you could give me that moment.
Just a little bit of your time.
15mins in the moonlight.
I'm guaranteed to blow your mind.

All you get is one night.
Channel your Olu Dara Mrs Jones.
Remember you haven't got a tomorrow.
But you own this moment.
Better make the most of it for both of us.
We ain't perfect but we're close to it.
And you can see how we react when we chat, right?
You could swear we made a pact in a past life.
That no matter where we were in the next one.
We wouldn't battle to create a connection.

Hey.
Chance we get.
This might just be the last we get.
Oh don't forget.
That a life is wasted with regret.
Ngoko nzakwenza ngako konke.
Uk'fezekisa yonk' iminqweno yam.

Reprise: Zubz Singing.

All you get is one night.
No Dream Girl until the sunrise.
Only certainty's the moment.
We own it.
Better make the most of it for both of us.
We ain't perfect but we're close to it.

The wrong key in a lock isn't supposed to fit.
Anomalies of the heart, we are the poster kids!
Hard to believe we are not more than associates.
If tomorrow sees us apart, so be it.

Zubz Chant and Beatbox.

I'm thinking.
Maybe it's the risk that we're taking or.
Maybe probably the kiss that I place on her lips.
Got her heart in her chest going.
-Beatbox- Word!

Musical Interlude.
