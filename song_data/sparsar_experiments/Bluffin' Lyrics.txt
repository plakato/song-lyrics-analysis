Bluffin' Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Production by Madlib.

Quasimoto we keep it on that next shit.
Lord Quas Mr. Budha-skeeta,Madlib control the head dip.
We doin' volume 2 taking over is a new breed.
Takin' out the wack niggas, speaking on hatred and greed.

Have em leavin with a stash for some prize money yo a purse full.

Yo you gotta have comprehension for this wack MC convention.
Another Madlib invention to get your attention.
We comin' from the dungeon lyrical surgeons.
Beat heard, splurgin'.
Keep it clean like a public washing machine.
Visine for your ears.
Ay yo.
ehh.

So tough MC's ain't really saying nothing.

Ay yo suckas try to bring it but strictly be bluffin'.
Quasimoto drop jewels on phony niggas actin' rough ehh.

I get deep like fathoms in ocean water.
To drown your wack artificial sonata.
And all the wack shit, I use ya'll niggas like remotes.
And remove you like coats of old paint, you irritatin' like a sore throat.

I ain't ... like Yvette Michele.
Tell ya'll niggas to freeze 'fore they bite my lyrical shells.

Word to Mr. Budha, ya'll niggas soundin' like intruders.
Yo I remember them niggas from way back.
Ya'll niggas ain't gonna shoot us.
I love callin' out you fake so so's on every coast.
Some niggas always actin' like hoes.

Talkin' 'bout they wanna freestyle but can't even rock a show.
Or write a cool song, probably just.
an average joe blow.
On deez nuts, 'cuz I'm coming for ya.
Out the lost gates of.
