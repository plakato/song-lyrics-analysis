Cardboard Crown Lyrics
by XamVolo.


Danger.
You don't wanna tell it like it is boy.
You don't wanna tell it like it is.

Its dangerous.
You don't wanna tell it like it is boy.
You don't wanna tell it like it is.

Sitting high, feeling low.
Paper sword, cardboard throne.
That's a young boy's song...
Thunderstorms, tornados.
Overthrown, we carry on.
Through Babylon...

Where we pledge our allegiance.
When we live by the legion...
Dark was the night, cold was the ground.
Out in the rain, in a cardboard crown...

Don't mind little old me.
I just say what I see.

Now, I bleed Styx into the sea.
She knows this and now she's after me.
...
IV drips, melodies.
Clashing chords'll be the death of me.
...

Where we leave our minds.
For these fools gold lives.
When we lead our eyes.
From these diamond mines.
Dark was the night, cold was the ground.
Out in the rain, in a cardboard crown...

Don't mind little old me.
I just say what I see.

You're sitting high and I'm feeling lost.
With your shiny cars and my cardboard box...
You're skipping stones off of xylophones.
And you sell it on, call it Cardboard Rock...

Dark was the night, cold was the ground.
Out in the rain, in a cardboard crown.
Dark was the night, cold was the ground.
Out in the rain, in a cardboard crown.
Dark was the night, cold was the ground.
Out in the rain...
