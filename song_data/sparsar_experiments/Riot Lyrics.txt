by Z-Mane.


Z-Mix 2x 
It's Royalty Gang or Die nigga 2x 
, 
Refrain, L.B.A., 
I, say yeah right. I got it 8x 
I say lame. Niggas be quiet, 3x 
You in the presence of a real nigga 
I, say lame. Niggas be quiet, 3x 
You in a real nigga's presence. 
 
Ok call me L.B.A. man. My rhyme is so
tasty 
I'm steady, doing work, while these other dudes is lazy. 
When, I'm in the booth. All these dudes start to hate me. 
They all know me as Lite Brite, but they chick can call me Daley 
Ah, 
, 
Damn right. I got it damn right, I'm bout, it 
A click full of killers. Please don't get us excited 
Yeah. We smoking loud, so lame niggas, be quiet 
And. If you fucking with us, we gon' start up a riot 
Im a start. A riot 8x 
 
Z-Mane Talking 
Ok ..., 
Yeah, ... 
You, already know what it is: ... 
 
Ok Royalty to the death of me. These lil niggas don't know about it. 
Get money everyday, but I'm took young to be poppin' bottles. 
I'Ll start a riot on these punk niggas 
me and Daley. We ain't trippin', 
We roll up. We take their women back to
the crib, and now we swimmin' 
Start a riot. We do it big. These niggas tryna put laws. On'Em 
They got a nigga feelin like Scrappy cause. I'M bout to put these paws
on'em 
Rollin, like 20's, do compared to me: 
they're miniscule 
Man. Even if I stand alone I'll start a riot on many fools 
Yeah right, I got it. I say yeah right, I'm bout, it 
These lames, claim they're real as me and Royalty man. I doubt it 
Me and my nigga named Lite Brite, be killin' niggas all day and night 
We bout to have the streets lit up when we come through with that riot 
Gyea
