Riot Lyrics
by Z-Mane.


Z-Mix 2x.
It's Royalty Gang or Die, nigga 2x.

Refrain: L.B.A..
I say, yeah, right, I got it  8x.
I say, lame niggas be quiet  3x.
You in the presence of a real nigga.
I say, lame niggas be quiet  3x.
You in a real nigga's presence!

Ok, call me L.B.A., man my rhyme is so.
tasty.
I'm steady doing work while these other dudes is lazy.
When I'm in the booth, all these dudes start to hate me.
They all know me as Lite Brite, but they chick can call me Daley.
Ah!

Damn, right, I got it , damn, right, I'm bout it.
A click full of killers, please don't get us excited.
Yeah, we smoking loud, so lame niggas be quiet.
And if you fucking with us, we gon' start up a riot.
Im a start a riot 8x.

Z-Mane Talking.
Ok.....
Yeah.....
You already know what it is.....

Ok, Royalty to the death of me, these lil niggas don't know about it.
Get money, everyday, but I'm took young to be poppin' bottles.
I'll start a riot on these punk niggas,.
me and Daley, we ain't trippin'.
We roll up, we take their women back to.
the crib, and now we swimmin'.
Start a riot, we do it big, these niggas tryna put laws on 'em.
They got a nigga feelin like Scrappy , cause I'm bout to put these paws.
on 'em.
Rollin, like 20's do, compared to me,.
they're miniscule.
Man even if I stand alone, I'll start a riot on many fools.
Yeah, right, I got it, I say, yeah, right, I'm bout it.
These lames claim they're real as me and Royalty, man, I doubt it.
Me and my nigga named Lite Brite be killin' niggas all day and night.
We bout to have the streets lit up when we come through with that riot.
Gyea!
