Butterfly Lyrics
by Bizarre.


Aye aye the idiotic kid's back 
Ready to attack ready to put two macks to your back 
Ain't, no fussin' when I start bustin', 
Lyrically cussin'. Why Jay Dee's want production 
Go to 212 to see my friends 
Too many Heineken's the whole crews fightin' to get in 
I'm lookin' around to see who want it. 
I wan na get blunted, but only got a dollar on it. 
The rude boys is frontin'. Legends is pumpin', 
Bella is jumpin', the heat is like shh, ..., bumpin', 
Ready or not rap world. Here I come 
Comin' to every battle screamin' out Who want some 
Lyrical warfare for MC's who step 
Caution, watch your step or I'll, destroy your rep 
Lookin' for the crews that cause a threat; 
We ain't ballers. Yet we ain't passin', no moet 
I'm playin' in between the sheets. In my jeep 
Lookin' for the freak with the big butt, cheeks 
No disrespect throw your hands up 
Yeah grab your girl tell her put her hands up: 
 
Throw your hands in the air 
Put, your blunts in the sky, 
Grab a cutie-pie 
And. Do the butterfly 
 
Cruisin' down the Ave just to hit a spot 
I got a fat girl on my jock 
I'm, a tell you why I'm the king and you're a peon 
See, what's happenin' your whole style is a rewind 
Whack MCs will get verbally shot. 
Cause ain't no style like the style. I got 
I'm the idiotic kid that they call Bizarre 
Get kick out at topless bars because I went too far. 
Don'T, try to roll if you're a beginner roll, a rookie 
Forget the blunts kid we high off weed-cookies 
Buddha sets represent the mid-west 
And. I can penetrate trough, vest 
Leaving a whole lot of mess, 
Three millers and a blunt boy. I'M too high 
Just cause I'm a big guy, don't mean I can't butterfly 
My crew's gettin' wasted in Noah's Arc 
I'm in the back of the club, smokin' blunts with Sonya Burnheart 
Don't matter. If your big short or tall 
Kick your game and give your girl a call 
The nights over kid, I'm still gettin' splifted 
Keith Murray dropped the half off the set, get lifted.
