Down Low Lyrics
by Bizarre.

Yeah this is dedicated to the big pussy.

Bizarre.
I'm involved with this lady and she weighs 380.
And she could barely fit in my Mercedes.
She's taking my dough.
My back accounts looking low.
And I'm about to throw her ass out in the snow.
I buy her burgers and steaks and all type of stuff.
But KFC and pot roasts are just not enough.

Down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.

Bizarre.
You came to my place high off of Picartie.
You had the nerve to strip dance at my boy's bachelor party.
She gave me head and broke my bed.
And there's really nothing else to be said.

Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.
Keep it on the down low, fat ho.

Bizarre.
Federation Records ain't got my number.
Keep it on the down low.
