Bananas (Who You Gonna Call?) Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.


Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl.
Standin' 'round waitin' for my queendom to fall.
Well I think not, styles are pipin' hot.
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got.

I'm tellin' you straight up, all sleepin' beauties better wake up.
I'll tear your state up, so set the date up.
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it.
Who did it, who does it.
From private to public.
Anywhere I'm in there and been there.
So recognize this, who the nicest.
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes.
Whatever you want I got.
Whether you ready or not.
It's about to get hot when I drop.
So notes, pause another spot.
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you.
Don't try to be me, do you.
Be coo' to you and do you.
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane.
I am the Queen, that's my name, time to explain.
That I spit game with dames.
Leave 'em all with shit stains.
Split frames, hopin' you hopin' that I'm jokin'.
Don't know but still blink off like fo'-fo's.
But so-so, slow mo's comin' in like the po-po's.
Don't want rocks comin' at me the wrong way.
Packin' much rocks, it's gonna be a long day.
And for real, spittin' on imbessiles and spinnin' wheels.
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted.
I'll take it to your stomach, run it, give me all.
Mic for mic, steppin' to me you gonna fall, we brawl.
Throwin' a two-piece so loose leafs.
It's the Q-U-double-E-N.
You know how I'm MCin'.

See physically you not ready.
Lyrically you not ready.
Mentally maybe.
Who talks tough, time to get the baby.
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on.
From dusk 'til dawn from night 'til mourn.
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks.
'til one of us admits it's a battle a whisk.

Are you out of your mind, doubtin' mines, out of line.
Talkin' out your behind, shoutin' rhymes out of time.
It's all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now.
Now you hush, hush now, ain't sayin' too much now.
Thought so, haunt yo' sleepin' ass, creepin' fast.
Like you was doin' somethin', now I gotta ruin somethin'.
You image, your career, lookie here you whole life is hangin' in the air.
Like a chandilier, poppin' off like a can of beer, understand is it clear.
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty.
Even though I'm low-key, you know me.
You be singin' over my tracks like it's kareoke.
If you don't know the half you gon' feel the wrath.
Represent the rugged path, the Flavor Unit staff.
Droppin' math'matics, layin' you out like craftmatic.
I'll let you have it, so you don't want the static.
