We Shoot Lyrics
by Woop.


If you want the lingo this. The preview 
Make'em run it back like a review. 
I ain't, the only shooter nigga we shoot 
Keep the fish scale, no seafood 
I'm, the type of nigga that will sneak you 
Heard. You got the work, then I need two 
Riding with the tool. I will piece you 
We the robbin' crew playing peekaboo, 
Dark-ass tints. You can't see through 
Chopper, like a phone. I can reach you 
Running old game like a P-2 
Cup full of swag cause. We keep juice 
Catch me posted up with the dope boys 
Meetings'round the table with the drug lords. 
Nigga. We don't talk, we the mug boys 
Keep, hollow tips, heavy slug boys, 
 
I'll, put a hole in the dope boy 
Nigga in the trap. He'S a dope boy. 
Bitch made ways like a ho boy: 
Old keep a cannon; never let it go boy 
Asking to a nigga. What it stand. Fo' 
I'll stick: a nigga for a bank roll 
Young rough niggas in the bando's 
I'm rapping, like I wrote it in a Lambo 
Action-packed niggas. Making movies 
Blowin' baby smokin' ooh-wee 
I, don't call'em pussy, call'em, coochie 
Woop rule # 2, keep a toolie 
Sold, a fake baby with the bareface 
Trappin' forward. This a rat race 
Hit at homeboy. That'S a mistake: 
Woop Lingo preview, this the matinee
