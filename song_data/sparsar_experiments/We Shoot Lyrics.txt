We Shoot Lyrics
by Woop.


If you want the lingo, this the preview.
Make 'em run it back like a review.
I ain't the only shooter, nigga we shoot.
Keep the fish scale, no seafood.
I'm the type of nigga that will sneak you.
Heard you got the work then I need two.
Riding with the tool, I will piece you.
We the robbin' crew playing peekaboo.
Dark-ass tints you can't see through.
Chopper like a phone, I can reach you.
Running old game like a P-2.
Cup full of swag cause we keep juice.
Catch me posted up with the dope boys.
Meetings 'round the table with the drug lords.
Nigga, we don't talk, we the mug boys.
Keep hollow tips, heavy slug boys.

I'll put a hole in the dope boy.
Nigga in the trap, he's a dope boy.
Bitch made ways like a ho, boy.
Old keep a cannon, never let it go boy.
Asking to a nigga what it stand fo'.
I'll stick a nigga for a bank roll.
Young rough niggas in the bando's.
I'm rapping like I wrote it in a Lambo.
Action-packed niggas making movies.
Blowin' baby ?, smokin' ooh-wee.
I don't call 'em pussy, call 'em coochie.
Woop rule #2, keep a toolie.
Sold a fake baby with the bareface.
Trappin' forward, this a rat race.
Hit at homeboy, that's a mistake.
Woop Lingo preview, this the matinee.
