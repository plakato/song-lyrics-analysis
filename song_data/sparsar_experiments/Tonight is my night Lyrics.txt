Tonight is my night Lyrics
by QUAZ SWAGGER.

Tired of tripping tired of fronting trying to be the perfect girl.
I gotta be big, I gotta be strong, i've got to conqure the world.
So excuse me haters get out of my way cause tonight is my night.
I said im ready ready for the battle , I said im ready to fight.

Im gonna push,push,push make it to the top.
So get out of my way ,cause I ain't ganna stop.
I said im moving,moving up.
Theres no next tine around.
Haters may hate and lie.
Butt a ain't coming down.

Make life worth living last.
Keep it moving, throw away youre past.
Cause its time to make things right.
So get to moving cause tonight is my night.
Oh,na,na,na.
Oh,na,na,na,na.
Oh,na,na,na.
Oh,na,na,na,na.
Cause tonight is mi night.
Yeah,tonight is mi night.
Uh.
