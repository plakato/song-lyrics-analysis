Arms for Hostages by X Lyrics
by X.

Our ships passed in the day 
And our stars, crossed in the night 
You've said: “Paradise is only far.” 
Oh. No, we will surely fall, 
Don't, look, don't look, don't look down, 
I saw a Hornet and an F-15 Eagle 
I saw a Tomcat fly over the rainbow. 
That must mean arms are for hugging 
Wait, don't shoot., I'm only kidding. 
Don'T, look, don't look, don't look down 
Shit, it was painful crashing through those branches. 
When you fall in love. You take your chances. 
I realize that you can't fly, but sometimes I idealize you 
Fly fly 
Just hold on to my hand, 
Please just look into my eyes. 
Don'T, look, don't look, don't look down, 
Don't! Look, don't look! Don'T look down!
