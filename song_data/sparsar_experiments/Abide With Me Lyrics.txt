Abide With Me Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Abide with me, fast falls the eventide.
The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee.
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power.
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be.
Through the cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.

Abide, abide with me.
Abide, abide with me.
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless.

I'll have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting?
Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still if Thou Abide with me.

Abide, with me Abide, With me.
Abide, abide with me.
Abide, abide with me.
