Cheery-O! Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


I use too be on a SeaFood diet/.
I'd see Food, then eat it, I ain't fancy.
huh, no cheese and Wine it/.
Please don't rewind it/ please don't remind him/.
Ice cream truck music still seduces N' excites him/.
Now I try to stay off beef, cause of the hormones/.
Eating beef, makes me wanna start beef, my warzone/.
Off the cob corny, love people like the Lord does/.
And stay on the grind like the coffee in your cup/.
Evil men covet dough and kill for money/.
Exploit the Promised Land flowing with milk and honey/.
Their outlook, get bread and cheese from here till death/.
Propaganda, food for thought, good it's not to ingest/.
Give thanks for life with its crazy nuts and good apples/.
So don't let any of these bad eggs trap you /.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for what's right/.
Spoon-fed lies all your life, I'm giving you a knife/.

Went from eating Cheerios, to saying ‘Cheery O!'/.
You want a real rap, oh now, oh here it goes/.
Went from eating Cheerios, to saying ‘Cheery O!'/.
Raise your glasses, Blare it from your stereos! /.
Went from eating Cheerios, to saying ‘Cheery O!'/.
You want a real rap, oh now, oh here it goes/.
Went from eating Cheerios, to saying ‘Cheery O!'/.
Life is sweet, but so surreal like cereal/.

Allergic to grammar, I'll never eat my words/.
But how will we learn to fly if we eat the birds? /.
Did belief in Father God rape Mother Earth? /.
And did the secular concrete jungle only make it worse? /.
The back of my old church/ had berry trees/.
They took em' out/ left a parking lot, such a scary scene/.
It ain't about/ the salary/ it's all about reality/.
But I don't know how/ to burn a calorie/ without/ kerosene/.
Can't live on beer and chips, nope I just can't do it/.
Dig it a grave in mud, yup Sandshrew it/.
They say Juicy Fruit, is gonna move ya/.
Fruit will, not the gum, unless you stupid/.
We treat our beer like gold and our water like piss/.
There's GMOs, it seems our problems might persist/.
Most of us don't know where our food comes from/.
And if we are what we eat, then guess what, we all lost son/.

I feed the hungry, you call me a saint/.
But if I asked questions about the state/ of poverty/.
Why people are hungry in the first place/.
You'll just Call it a short communist phase/ with mockery/.
