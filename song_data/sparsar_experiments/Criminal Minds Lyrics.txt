Criminal Minds Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


I look the knife and slit his throat.
Like a chef would steak.
This shit is wild cuz we was cool just yesterday.
Bag on the floor with all the cash and the diamonds.
Thirsty had a look in his eyes all demonic.
And all in time and next thing you know it.
Thirsty shot Illa.
Tony shot Thirsty.
I shot Tony while he shot me.
Who'd a thought B.
I woke up this morning.
That I was gonna die today.
Let's start from the beginning.
Yeah.
Criminal minds.
Criminal thoughts yeah.
I woke up starving.
Brushed my teeth and got something to drink.
Turkey bacon and waffles then made a run to the bank.
A little deposit just for my bills to withdraw.
How can I profit when I'm working just to say I ain't got it.
Waiting in line white man in the front taking his time.
Cuz he knows that he's rich and I ain't making a dime.
Shit can't just recline cuz playing it safe just ain't designed to get us paid.
So I'm thinking of crimes.
That's when I pulled out.
Put the 38 to his spine.
Told the teller to show me her hands.
Empty the register.
Bag full of hunneds twenties a bunch of fifties.
Used the crack ass as shells.
Told the cop he's coming with me.
When n*ggas turn criminal they don't go back.
I didn't come to kill nobody but they don't know that.
My eyes made the cops put his gun down.
Fuck it I'm on the run now.
I'm getting nervous thinking about my son now.
But It's too late for all that soft shit.
I'm driving fast but cautious.
Feeling nauseous becoming exhausted.
Heart racing like Usain Bolt.
You get that feeling in your legs like you can't walk.
It's like you got a lot to say but you can't talk.
You'll do whatever it takes to get these bills past due paid off.
So i pulled over to a safe location.
Then we slowly set the car on fire so the jakes won't trace them.
Then we changed clothes and guess what was next.
He winked at me as I gave him his cut then left.
Criminal minds.
Criminal thoughts.
Yeah.
I woke up the next morning with the cockiest smirk.
Ain't feeling guilty cuz fuck it ain't nobody get hurt.
There's only two things to life.
Either you lose or you win.
And since I came up I might as well do it again.
That's how my enemies became my role models.
I make a play and want more.
I tried to gain but this game is so hollow.
Got a phone call white man hit me he got another plan.
Five man job we each walk with a couple grand.
Hit my mans Tony and Illa.
You see Tony a dealer.
But yo Illa shit homie a killer.
And Big Thirsty was the get away driver.
He whip the vans like coups and keep the hands on demand like Snoop.
My man like you I fear no man.
Born and raised a poor man.
That's why my heart colder than the snow man yo.
Anyway we at the meet up spot.
To speak on how we gonna re-up to flee from cops.
You see what's not gonna happen is.
Any mistakes or accidents.
Playing Grand Theft Auto for practicing.
Now the plan is to run up on this Russian dude next.
Gun in my sweats like who wanna play Russian Roulette.
No regrets n*gga I know what it takes.
Riding to his place for that money and the diamonds in the safe.
We straight Tony cut off surveillance.
We are preparing to make our move.
Waiting for that call for clearance.
Got the call now.
Illa knocked the front guards out.
Now the other guards coming with their guns all out.
See what y'all about to witness is.
How the victims is.
Not the suspects or witnesses.
Where images of death flashing.
He put the shooters in place.
Then he quickly hit the room with the safe.
That's when I moved him away.
Too in his face y'all two minutes late.
Told him type the combination.
I'm losing all my patience.
As the door opened I noticed the safe was empty.
See now I'm feeling kinda played and I ain't so friendly.
As Satan in me shot him right in his calf.
I'm screaming at him like.
What happened to the diamonds and cash.
He said a white man just robbed him and dashed.
About two minutes before I arrived and I was two minutes late.
Okay it's time to ride side to side.
Maybe I should go get a 9 to 5.
Fuck it I'm thinking homicide.
Rent-A-Cop to nine.
Told Big Thirsty meet me about a block away.
Tony your in-law already at the spot.
Okay this cracker gonna die today.
This cracker gonna fly away.
My fortune is gonna fry his face.
Gonna put him inside his grave.
Tony hit me like Big get out.
Said he saw the white man leaving setting off a bomb in the house.
Now I'm running like I got extra legs.
As I escaped the explosion I know we thinking I was left for dead.
Now we speeding in the wind we know we ain't live.
In the way Thirsty drive we gonna beat him to his crib.
We waiting in his living room pitch black.
Big straps fully loaded with the kickback.
I hear him walking up the stairs about to open the door.
Fucking snowstorm it ain't nothing colder than war.
That's when he walked in and hit the lights.
Soon as he saw me tried to run but Illa hit him twice.
I look the knife and slit his throat.
Like a chef would steak.
This shit is wild cuz we was cool just yesterday.
Bag on the floor with all the cash and all the diamonds.
Thirsty had a look in his eyes all demonic.
And all in time and next thing you know it.
Thirsty shot Illa.
Tony shot Thirsty.
I shot Tony while he shot me.
His was a head shot game was over.
Tried to hit me in the head but it grazed my shoulder.
I pick up the bag and hit the hallway.
Then I heard a Russian voice say.
This is your day.
Then he.
