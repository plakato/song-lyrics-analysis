Girlfriend Lyrics
by Queen Pen.


Queen Pen: Me'shell Ndegeocello, play for me, c'mon talk to me.
Me'shell: anyone know, it never ceases to amaze me how everbody's always in.
Somebody else's buisness, looking for something, but 'cha know.
For what it's worth - We could give a fuck!

Me'shell: Girlfriend, girlfriend, yes i had your girlfriend.
Queen Pen: If that was your girlfriend, if that was your girlfriend.
If that.
Was your girlfriend, she wasn't last night.

Now how you just gon' be playa hatin' on me.
Coz i got mad bitches just wanting me.
And i got mad niggas just checkin' for me see.
I got more stock than you ever see, i be....
The one that your main squeeze been diggin.
Pull you out your closet, sex on weekends.
It's my buisness of what i do, him or her, he or she, inside you.
So while you be yappin' and talkin to your friends.
Beefin 'bout that yellow chicken, the green benz.
I'll be havin' all your people's info with the second part of my ???
She slid the number, what you gettin mad at me for.
She said she was single when she closed my car door.

Me'shell: so queen tell me, where did you meet her.

Queen Pen: On the sunday, mac, she was walking out ???
I was just chillin, mindin my own business.
Sittin on the corner, waitin for my sister.
When she slid by, maybe 4 or 5 times.
Wanted me to notice the rythm of her thighs.
Oh boy, uh, girls are just so funny to me.
I can see how niggas get into these beefs.
She knew she had a man when she came up in the piece.
She said she was a regular and how about me.
If she gave me her digits would i call her after three.
The way she fliked her hips made you move to have to see.
How these chinese jamaican tried to draw it by me.
It never ceases to amaze me.

Me'shell: Ain't nobody gotta know just how much you want me.

Now how i've ran, you've only a few.
But you can back track and ask them how i do it how it is.
Who the flyest chick, with the phattest whip.
And run her all night, like a burger with a chip.
And if it's all good then i feature it again.
Like a fix remix,.
See you gots to be real like my ex beverly.
You don't have your man just stressin out on me.
Coz he can't control how you throw your pussy.
I'm a baller and i been for a ???
And if i choose to jerk her off then it's all on me.
See you claimed that was your girl, well that's not how it seems.
Uh, it never ceases to amaze me.

Me'shell: Coz i like to get down so if you's wants ta i will.
I love to love ya' baby.
