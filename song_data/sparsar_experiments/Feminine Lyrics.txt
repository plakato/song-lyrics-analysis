Feminine Lyrics
by Swift.

Just go away--.
Im trapped and im looking for a way out.
You see, this is no longer worth it--.
I mean the thought of you and i, together.
Forever, no longer strikes me as perfect.

Im trapped in this world of love and hate.
Stuck in this, redundancy--forced to evaluate.
My coming situation, im basing all my love.
On the past, but the past won't last.

You won't let go, this fucking ball and chain--.
Has got me acting like your enemy, and i.
Don't know what i want anymore.

Im trapped and im looking for a way out.
You see--because this is no longer worth it.
The thought of you and i, together, forever.
No longer strikes me as perfect.

Im trapped im stuck, i need a way out, i wish.
I knew what was in your head, its been too.
Long--although these thoughts are wrong--.
I feel this temptations too strong.

I gotta snap this--this fucking ball and chain.

You won't let go, this fucking ball and chain--.
Has got me acting like your enemy, and i don't.
Know what i want anymore. this ball and chain.
Has got me running for the back door.

I wish i could go-but you won't let go.
