Freewill Lyrics
by Rush.

There are those who think.
That life has nothing left to chance.
A host of holy horrors.
To direct our aimless dance.

A planet of playthings.
We dance on the strings of powers we cannot perceive.
The stars aren't aligned or the gods are malign.
Blame is better to give than receive.

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice.
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill.
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose freewill.

There are those who think.
That they were dealt a losing hand.
The cards were stacked against them.
They weren't born in Lotus Land.

All preordained, a prisoner in chains.
A victim of venomous fate.
Kicked in the face, you can pray for a place.
In heaven's unearthly estate.

Each of us, a cell of awareness.
Imperfect and incomplete.
Genetic blends with uncertain ends.
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet.
