Celice Lyrics
by A-ha.

Celice, it's in the way you hurt me, Celice, I know that I'm alive.
Open up inside, make me want you, make me want to.
Wrap yourself around me, hold me tighter, hold me tight as only you can.

Celice, it's in the way you hurt me.
Celice, you sharpened all my senses, I know you're on my side.

Celice, it's in the way you teach me, Celice, to chase the thoughts away.
You open up my eyes, made me want you, made me want to.
You know it feels so nice, hold me tight now, hold me tight as can be.

Celice, it's in the way you hurt me.
Celice, it's in the way you hurt me.
Celice, I know that I'm alive.
Celice, you sharpened all my senses, I know you're on my side.
