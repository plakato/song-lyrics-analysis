Charmin Lyrics
by Tyler Major.


Young lad--dont even think of takin this beat.
I know your moves maggot let me recite the thoughts that you mite think.

The off beat is killin em but never will I remain flat.
They're dormant on performances dont appear save your money jack.
\---cuz all you'll get is two earfuls.
Of moms bitchin at you for spendin 2 months of rent on THAT dude.
\---the clever fellow never seems blazed.
Except whens hes concocting the secret formula on mics these days.
Take it from the goose walking on pelicans.
If he can fly then he can get shot down just like the rest of them.

Its takin the audience to the renaissance--they said kick it for one time.
\--i suggested they rob stores.
Add another member to their bundle-- just to match their lost scores.
Just another loser sore.
we need help on aisle 13 he rammed his body into the Charmin tissue now h e's.
on the FLOOR!

\---Whoopsie doos shout outs to gloomybear.
Give me a second to find the room, theres witnesses everywhere.
\--they must've followed me to my hiding place.
-nevermind the laughter thats in the room, its fills emptiness, thanks.
Sideways eyes always helps the moody joe.
Mightier than the sirens at 11 near the studios.
Taxin on the plans ask your crew to ask your mans.
The schemin is---too damn misbelievin for his master plans.
Check the framework for it before you drop the prices.
\--they said that he rhymed too cold just like the ices.
Riddle me that a wichita, tahiti punch without the straw.
\---we got the vibrant thangs much like what tip was on.
