Charmin Lyrics
by Tyler Major.


Young lad, -- dont, even think of takin. This beat 
I know your moves maggot. Let me recite the thoughts that you mite think
 
The off beat is killin em, but never will I remain flat. 
They'Re dormant on performances, dont appear. Save your money, jack 
\, -- -cuz. All you'll get is two earfuls 
Of moms bitchin at you for spendin 2 months of rent on THAT dude 
\ -- -the clever fellow, never seems blazed 
Except whens hes concocting the secret formula on mics these days, 
Take it from the goose walking on pelicans 
If. He can fly, then he can get shot down. Just like the rest of them, 

Its takin the audience to the renaissance --. They said kick it for one time: 
\ --, i suggested they rob stores 
Add another member to their bundle, -- just to match their lost scores. 
Just. Another loser sore 
we need help on aisle 13. He rammed his body into the Charmin tissue. Now h, e's
on the FLOOR, 
 
\, --, -Whoopsie doos, shout outs to gloomybear 
Give me a second to find the room theres witnesses everywhere, 
\ -- they must've, followed me to my hiding place, 
-nevermind the laughter thats in the room. Its fills emptiness thanks 
Sideways eyes, always helps the moody joe 
Mightier than the sirens at 11 near the studios. 
Taxin on the plans. Ask your crew to ask your mans 
The schemin is -- -too, damn misbelievin for his master plans, 
Check the framework for it before you drop the prices. 
\ --. They said that he rhymed too cold. Just like the ices 
Riddle me that a wichita tahiti punch without the straw, 
\ -- -we got the vibrant thangs much like what tip was on
