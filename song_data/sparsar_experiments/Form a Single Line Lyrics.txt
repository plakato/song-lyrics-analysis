Form a Single Line Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

Just move along.
Form a single line.
Just move along.
Your soul is mine.
Here we stand united.
A collective force of sheep.
Trained to sacrifice each other.
For this noble cause.
Just move along.
Form a single line.
Just move along.
Your soul is mine.
Just move along.
Form a single line.
Just move along.
Your soul is mine.
It is time, it is no or never.
We need nothing short of a revolution now.
We can't just fold, we will have to fight.
We can't just stand by.
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake.
Or nothing will ever change.
Or nothing will ever change.
Or nothing will ever change.
Just move along.
Form a single line.
Just move along.
Your soul is mine.
Just move along.
Form a single line.
Just move along.
Your soul is mine.
