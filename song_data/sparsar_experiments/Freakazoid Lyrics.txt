Freaky, very sneaky.
Tell me Freakazoid what do you want from me?

Freaky, very sneaky.
Tell me Freakazoid what do you want from me?

She was a Freakazoid coming from another land.
With the looks that'll catch the eye of any man.
There's something about this girl but I've never seen her before.
And to that lonely day I seen this girl, she knocked on my door.

Digge Doms.
Yeah, she looked good and all that.
She's stacked in the front, matter of fact, the back.
But yo watch her stay fly.
Fiss, you know how it is when you're trying to make it in showbiz.

Mistafiss.
I hear ya Digge Doms but yo I had to go and find out on my own.
She was the finest of them all yo Rosta Swann he said Be gone.
But then again ya know I really wanted to bone.
When we made love I fell in love.
Yo take it slow.
Is what my nigga Ding Ding said but I had to find out on my own.
Oh why the fellas gotta be jealous.
Would you believe I seen her freaking ?
That's when I found out on my own.
Oh I really don't know.

I be the Mistafiss don't ever try to kiss.
Or diss or treat me like a lame.
You took my heart and then you played your stanky game.
Oh yes my friends they told me all about you.
But I was blind I couldn't find that it was true.
Oh now I know and yes I know you'll be destroyed.
You know no better you're just a Freakazoid.
You're gonna be back cause I know that you're a ho.
Oh Digge Dom Digge Doms I don't know.

Or diss or treat me like a lame.
You took my heart and then you played your stanky game.
Oh yes my friends they told me all about you.
But I was blind I couldn't find that it was true.
Oh now I know and yes I know you'll be destroyed.
