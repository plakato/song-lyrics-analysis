Talking:.
Hold up Z-Ro the Crooked aka King of the Ghetto.
Screwed Up Click soldier for life.

Huh, inside out, that boy Harlem done touch ground.
Hold up man, know what I'm saying ridgemont fo for life.

We going to hold it down you know what I'm talking about.
And that's Real Talk.
Z-Ro Freestyle.
25 Lighters on my dresser yes sir.
Got a bad black bitch that drives a black compressor.
You know I'm smoking on that herb.
Every damn day just to calm my damn nerves.
Screwed Up Click ain't never going to switch.
Nigga build a ditch for a motherfucking snitch.
Talking to the laws given up info.
Catch me at the pad black lamp smoking indo.
Sipping on drank on a whole liter.
This for nigga Moe I got a nine millimeter.
And a 45. I'm a keep it live.
Do it in 08' like in 95'.
That was the year I made it clear.
Wrecken on the microphone to get away from here.
I'm reppin' for the south with diamonds in my mouth.
And diamonds on my hands and diamonds in my house.
Shinning so bright.
Even in the night.
Smoking on cush what the fuck is top flight.
I'm only on the good bitch I wish you would.
Keeping it all world ya'll keeping it all hood.
Trying to get paper pull another capper.
Man my house is swoah something like Tony Drapper.
Got to get my mill from my record sell.
This time last year I was in a jail cell.
Waiting for commissary waiting on mail call.
Man I can't wait till I get free cause I'm a ball.
Put it in they face free my partner Grace.
What's up to that Los what's cracking cause I'm straight lase.
What's up to that Pokey.
What's up to that Woldy.
Always kept it real never act like they ain't know me.
Soldier Boy love Z-Ro is who I am.
Back in the days signed with that ex fam.
Me in the phat and that Street Military.
R I P Maleak in the day in the cemetery.
But it ain't over chip on my shoulder.
Catch me brand new candy blue range rover.
Rollin to the end my skin is my sin.
And like LiL KeKe say it never will ever end.
Gots to keep flowing I'm a keep it going.
Back in 92' I probably could kick your door in.
Nigga lay it down lay it down you hoes lay it down.
I reppin' for the South Side of that H-Town.
Screwed Up Click until it's over with.
AK with catch bag on my shoulder bitch.
You will die fucking with that Ro.
He ain't never been a bitch he ain't never been no hoe.
Don't know how to be a broad don't know how to be a mark.
I put the rubbers on cause it just turn dark.
Mashing on the gas pocket full of cash.
Looking for a yellow bone bitch with big ass.
I ain't disrespecting just telling the truth.
Ya'll know how I do it when I gets up in the booth.
I'm a go hard till I chip my fucking tooth.
In a fly murder four door of coof.
Yeah I get my paper yeah I get my bread.
I don't give a damn what you bitch niggas done said.
Talking down on me cause I'm a get my spread.
I ain't tripping I'm in the kitchen whippin' up a batch.
Batch of them pies for all the time guys.
Watching out for the FED they be in disguise.
Looking like G looking like ballas.
Looking like ture money making shot callas.
But them boys laws yeah that's them folks.
I ain't tripping cause I know it's hot on postoak.
Back in the day I had a pocket full of rocks.
24/7 365 around the clock.
About to get paid stacking up my paper.
I hit a lick then it's time for me to lay low.
Just run on my screen on 360 playing Halo.
Hoes dropping like it's hot when ever I say so.
Cause I'm the man diamonds on my hand.
Got big bass in the back of the blue van.
It's blue over gold the story been told.
Benjamin franklin and two blacks wheel 4.
My flow is real cold I ain't never been wacked.
And thanks to Bun-B and Pimp-C I got two gold plaques.
They hanging on my wall pimp I miss you dog.
Bun-B ride for that boy and make them crawl.
Do it for the south and do it for the Hawk.
And who ever don't like it keep my dick up in they mouth.
I'm Screwed Up Click till they lay me in my casket.
I ride around Houston with that plastic.
Hand on my steel wood grain wheel.
You can hardy see me with the diamonds on my grill.
You can hide behind the parts of diamonds on my wrist.
And can't nobody do it like me cause I do it like this.
And never had love for a bitch.
All I'm trying to really do is get rich.
Trying to get my fucking bread baby.
Ride in mercedes I know a nigga hate me.
But I don't give a damn nah I don't give a fuck.
Riding on drapped up 26's on my truck.
Hell yeah bitch I know they large.
Got three foreigns cars in my garage.
I never sabotage my fucking career.
Had to make it clear and I shed another tear.
But nigga I'm real bumper and grill.
When I do my music it's the music you can feel.
Cause I'm just a G riding one deep.
And every time I ride I ride with gun on seat.
Watching out for jackers cause I know they scoping.
Trying to leave a real niggas head wide open.
Pulling down swangas cause they ain't clacking.
I'm rolling on 20 inch 4's bitch what happening.
Looking so fly I don't smoke fry.
Got to be a G till the day that I die.
That's my big homie boy that Lil Ke.
Boy you know I love you it's you and me.
In this damn thing we going to do it for the Screw.
And do it for the South and I'm a do it for you.
And you going to do it for me it's S.U.C.
Screwed Up Click until I D I E.
Nigga don't get me crunk watch me pop trunk.
Smoking on cush ain't never seen skunk.
Man I'm so throwed caught me in the zone.
I don't give a fuck about you calling on my phone.
I fucks with the stripper versace on my zipper.
This the nigga Ro taper fade with the clipper.
I brought my partner for my partner Paul.
About to make a million dollars and buy the whole mall.
Call that bitch Mo-Town and it's gonna go down.
A couple of day from now I got a show in your town.
And I'm a get paid and I'm a get laid.
And every car I drive, candy paint going to get sprayed.
On the doors nigga and on the side dog.
And I ain't scared I got jesus on my side dog.
Hit the church house and then go work out.
And after that you it's time to pull the purp out.
And I'm a roll one and I'm a smoke one.
And I'm a roll one and I'm a smoke one.
And I'm a roll one and I'm a smoke one.
Now I'm out of my mind that's what that smoke done.
But I'm a maintain still in the same game.
But only thing ain't making the same change.
I getting paid boy you better believe that.
A grammy on my shelf I'm a achieve that.
Cause I can do it nigga even tho you say I can't.
But I don't give a fuck about ya'll I'm about my bank.
I hope you feel that bitch nigga you.
You could put your wig back ain't nobody going to be missing you.
You a hoe nigga not a role nigga.
Cause Z-Ro make more doe nigga.
More versus more mixtapes more shows nigga.
And I ain't ever at home I'm on the road nigga.
I'm chasing fedi baby ya'll ain't ready baby.
Yeah I'm living like a motherfucking chevy baby.
Or like a ford I'm buit ford ford tough.
Blowing on that real real purple purple stuff.
Talking about that cush got it from the band tho.
Watch me come down with my pistol in my hand hoe.
Don't run up on me if you don't want to get shot.

Hold up man hold up.
Z-Ro Freestyle.
