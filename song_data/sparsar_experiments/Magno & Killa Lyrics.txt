Magno & Killa Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


The game is a struggle, we gotta get scrilla.
Fuck the fame it's a hustle,.
When you see us at them shows, on 4's or 24's.
Pulling top notch hoes,.

Magno.
This game is a hustle, but Mag's on a money plot.
Catch me on a hundred blocks, entourage big but nobody do the bunny hop.
And y'all think, the sun is hot.
You ain't seen shit, I stay swarmed by a hundred bops.
Getting crunk, whenever they see paper.
Can't believe my wallet's more swoll, than A.C. Slater.
And yours is low like Screech, I got fo' white freaks.
In a black Taurus, I'm the black Zach Morris.
Who has a colder flow, than my shit.
My whip equipped with hot shit, radio flipping too a Motorola Sidekick.
When it comes to fly shit, Magno's a pilot.
Since the last time that I spit, I just got harder.
Hop out white Tee, S dot Carter's.
Bitch pressed away the hate, so my chest got broader.
The rest, got frauder.
My paper bubble, courtesy of the hustle nigga.

Kyleon.
I'ma let the screens rain mayn, pop trunk and bang mayn.
Piece and chain hang, like I'm in a chain gang mayn.
Everytime I swang bang, Killa finna lane change.
Gripping on the grain, while I'm puffing on the Jane mayn.
On any track it's a fact, Killa bring the pain mayn.
To these other cats, that's trying to jack us for our slang mayn.
So I'ma wreck and push eject, it's time to change the game mayn.
And bring the noise to these boys, that's trying to claim my fame mayn.
I'm flyer than a plane mayn, connected like a train mayn.
Boss Hogg, Swishahouse we well respected in this game mayn.
Don't make me aim the thang mayn, and put it to your brain mayn.
And turn you five-dolla dudes, into a pile of change mayn.
Killa Kyleon flow is, hotter than a flame mayn.
I'm blowing up, just like a pot of hot caine mayn.
Sick hustle game mayn, like I need medication.
I keep haters heads turning, like a swanga's rotation mayn.

Magno.
This is audio dope, A-1 no whip.
Uncut numb your tongue, after one song you sprung.
Inhale it hard enough, in one lung you done.
And that's as real as it get, I'm on the grind.
I'm trying to stay up in the game, I can't remain on the pine.
And now-a-day's a lot of niggas, hating for real.
Cause I'm in front of cameras with the mic, like April O'Neal.
That's why I stay strapped, for enemies.
These days even your friends'll do you in, ask Patrick Dennehey.
Niggas swear they flow is colder than mine, before they heard it.
Now I got 'em sweating like Kobe Bryant, before the verdict.
Here's a napkin asswipe, now pass the mic.
You should of known I control the streets, like traffic lights.
Money stretch, like elastic right.
Collection Plate all flows, that's a classic right ask your wife.
But she might just say yeah, because I smashed iight.
