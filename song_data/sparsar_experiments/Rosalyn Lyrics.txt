Rosalyn Lyrics
by Vitesse.

Can't wait to see my girl.
She's been travellin' the world.
Rosalyn wasn't out of my mind.
I was thinking of her all the time.

She's gone cool.
I know she ain't no fool.
For the one who's turning me on.
And got plenty of time, hanging on.

Hey, Rosalyn.
You're still my everything.
Rosalyn was not off my mind.
I was seeing her picture all the time.

Good lovers all around.
It was a pleasant town.
No chance of loosing my heart.
Cause true love was my bodyguard.

Hey, Rosalyn.
You're still my everything.
Rosalyn was not off my mind.
I was seeing her picture all the time.

Hey, Rosalyn.
You're still my everything.
Rosalyn was not off my mind.
I was seeing her picture all the time.

Hey, Rosalyn.
You're still my everything.
Rosalyn was not off my mind.
I was seeing her picture all the time.

Rosalyn.
