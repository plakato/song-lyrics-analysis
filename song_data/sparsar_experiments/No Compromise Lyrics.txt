No Compromise Lyrics
by Vision.

Who are you and what does it mean.
To brand yourself part of an underground scene?
Without the passion, you've sold your soul.
To gain some measure of control.
Somehow it seems that the point was missed.
The power's in your head, not in your fists.

Over the years.
We had to rise.
We did it our way.
There was no compromise.

Countless others have come and gone.
They make some noise and they move right along.
It's not an image that we are portraying.
It's not a game that other's like playing.
We'll never break and we're not going to bend.
This is one message for us to send.

Over the years.
We had to rise.
We did it our way.
There was no compromise.
