Anagram Lyrics
by Rush.

Words by neil peart, music by geddy lee and alex lifeson.

There's a snake coming out of the darkness.
Parade from paradise.
End the need for eden.
Chase the dreams of merchandise.

There is tic and toc in atomic.
Leaders make a deal.
The cosmic is largely comic.
A con they couldn't conceal.

There is no safe seat at the feast.
Take your best stab at the beast.
The night is turning thin.
The saint is turning to sin.

Raise the art to resistance.
Danger dare to be grand.
Pride reduced to humble pie.
Diamonds down to sand.

Take heart from earth and weather.
The brightness of new birth.
Take heart from the harvest.
Shave the harvest from the earth.

Reasoning is partly insane.
Image just an eyeless game.
The night is turning thin.
The saint is turning to sin.

Miracles will have their claimers.
More will bow to rome.
He and she are in the house.
But there's only me at home.

Rose is a rose of splendor.
Posed to respond in the end.
Lonely things like nights.
I find, end finer with a friend.

I hear in the rate of her heart.
A tear in the heat of the art.

The night turns thin.
The saint turns to sin.
