I'm Her Man (Sweet Baby Jesus) Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Oh sweet Jesus, I don't know what to do.
I got a long-legged woman but she's in love with you.
I'm her man, but she don't treat me right.

I bring her daisies every morning, roses every night.
But she tells me they're the gift of God and I ain't got the right.
I'm her man, but I ain't her Lord.

Well you know I like whiskey, crazy about my gin.
Well she told me to quit my low-down ways or she'd quit me like the wind.
I'm her man, I do what she says.

But one more trip downtown, you know, I gotta wet my lip.
But Jesus went and told on me, I can't get a sip.
I'm her man, I quit right away.

So she took me to church last Sunday... God knows what for.
I had to watch for three long hours while she made love to the Lord.
I'm her man, but she don't know me no more.

Well I can't heal no sick, and I can't sight no blind.
But I can rip guitar like a holy ghost and she told her I ain't lyin'.
She got her love, and the devil's mine.

Oh Sweet Jesus, I found out what to do.
You've been messin' with my woman, gonna put my gun on you.
I'm her man, and her savior too.
