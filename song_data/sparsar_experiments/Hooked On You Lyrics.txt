Hooked On You Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Whoa.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Whoa, whoa.

Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Whoa.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
You're sexy real.

I can't explain what I'm going through.
Wish I could find the right words to say.
Losing control.
And it's over you.
Nobody else can make me feel this way.

Could it just be that I'm curious.
And I wanna make you play my game.
But something tells me that it's serious.
Because I go insane.
When I hear your name.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What can I do?
It's over you.

I try to hide it.
But I know it's true.
My body trembles when I look in your eyes.
I'm so turned on.
I don't know what to do.
It seems your touch can make my temperature rise.

Can it just be that I'm curious.
And I wanna make you play my game.
But something tells me that it's serious.
Because I go insane.
When I hear your name.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What can I do?
It's over you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

That's cool.
Th-th-th-that's cool.
Ho.
Sexy.
Ho.
Sexy.

I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.

What can I do?
It's over you.

When days grow long and nights grow cold.
You are the one I need to hold.
I'm taken by your sexy ways.
Trapped inside this lover's maze.
I wanted you right from the start.

Why can't you see.
You stole my heart.
Just loving you can set me free.

Oh, can't you see?

Hearts on fire.
Higher.
Higher.
Nobody else can make me feel the way that you do.

Could it be that this time.
Love has taken all control.
You're the one whose touch I need.
The one I need to hold.
Could it be that this time.
Love has taken all control.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

The one I need to hold.
What can I do?
It's over you.
