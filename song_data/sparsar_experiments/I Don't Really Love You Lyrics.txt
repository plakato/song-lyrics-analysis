I Don't Really Love You Lyrics
by Sworn In.


I don't.
I don't.
I don't really love you.
No, I don't really love you.
And I don't care.

Just my luck.
Spit in my face because I gave a fuck.
Love is dead.

I'll melt with you.
Together in our heads.
I don't care how long I've been dead.
Dressed in all black.
Late for my funeral.
Don't got my soul back.
That's only natural.

I don't.
I don't.
I don't really love you.
No, I don't really love you.
And I don't care.

Love is dead, love is dead.
Put this gun to your head.
Let's paint the world our own shade of red.

I don't.
I don't.
I don't really love you.
No, I don't really love you.
And I don't care.

It doesn't matter.
Nothing feels fine.
I feel nothing all the fucking time.
You've made a stage in my head.
That I'll replace with lead.
I'm screaming love is dead, love is dead, love is dead.

Love is dead.

I never.
I never said this would be alright.
I never.
I never said this love would burn bright.
