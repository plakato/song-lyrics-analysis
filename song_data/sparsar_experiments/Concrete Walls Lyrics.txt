Concrete Walls Lyrics
by Unleash The Sky.

Here I stand in silence: 
My head against the wall. 
Everything I had went wrong. 
DonÂ´T know where I belong: 
, 
Concrete walls, 
 
Middle of december 
Time, is standing still. 
I am feeling so alone, 
Million miles away from home, 
 
Snow-capped memories, 
In, a town I'll, never call my home 
I, really wonder who brought me to this place: 
To, a town I'll, never call my home 
 
So, hopeless, 
Endless, concrete walls. 
And. I see your face. 
So, hopeless 
When, the silence calls 
And. I see your face: 
 
Here I stand in silence. 
Waiting for a sign. 
I am begging for the past 
And the memories to last
