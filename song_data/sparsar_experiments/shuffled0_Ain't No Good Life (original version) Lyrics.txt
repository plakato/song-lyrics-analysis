Ain't No Good Life (original version) Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.


I mean foldin' money.
Well I want lovin', said I don't need a buddy.

Not the one that I lead.
And I know where it went.
I'm gonna try a dyin' attempt.
Just don't let nobody tell you, oh what you oughta do.
Lord, that don't mean I ain't forgiven.
Brother you know you'll only wind up in your own stew.

Just cause I'm alive.
I don't need nobody, now.
I don't even know where last month went.
Well cause my money's already spent.
I said it went on that damn rent.
Women, don't try to cook nothin' up, ooh.
Just tryin' to say.

It only seems the more that I grieve.
I wanna know, tell me why is it so.
Well I don't mean change, baby.
Well I look back on the good times.
Yeah I tell ya.
Ain't no good life.
Well just because I don't pray.
It's sort of old, borrowed and blue.
Oh you'll find it kind of hard on you.
I'm gonna get myself together.
Ain't exactly my idea.
Don't try that straight life buddy.
Talkin' about the good times slippin' by.
Cause the more I fight the sadness, yeah.
Well I can't make no money baby.
As some lost part of me.
That don't mean I'm makin' a livin'.
