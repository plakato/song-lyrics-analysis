Eye For Eye 2 Lyrics
by Swift.


Put on hand on my friend, I send two men, two mummies.
Think you can phone for a benz, ha ha funny.
Man got cats like Benz.
Who's that? That's Benz Punarny.
Man just robbed the connect, now man's feeling pluggy.
Make gyal say Ah ah wait let me get comfy.
Walking round your ends like everyting lovely.
Bow, bow, bow.
Make man jump fence like bunnies.
Blowing out, come back I warn say sutten.
You talk much with your mouth, I put in work with my cousin.
Man down, anytime man rise up sutten.
That's a trap house, bro's selling hmm hmm in sutten.
Check the background, everyone round me on sutten.
Pack, that's Pacquiao.
What you saying? You want sutten?
Brap, that's a Matic round.
Let it rain, run away, wet up your cousin.
Big mash like a car, man have to clutch it.
Splash, splash, splash.
Wet like the gyal that I'm fucking.
Uckface wanna spend the night but I ain't no ediat.
Sidemen on the other side, them man are policemen.
He gon' know eye for an eye when the mandem see him.
No hi, no bye, just boom bang from the 2 litres.
I bring your gyal round, she's going down like the DM's.
If I do a piss I be quick cause she's probably teefing.
When I get a brick I make Z's, then I go and make dealings.
Walk with the thing, I am not any human being.
Man brang a brick it was shit, man should teef it.
Man just flex, gyal wanna press she gotta be decent.
Hat hat, mash mash, handbrake leaking.
Man'a get bread, man'a get cheques, man'a just eating.
Them man are so dead, them man are so stressed, man are just preeing.
Gyal ain't so peng, see her in the ends, she was half decent.
Chilling with skets, you know they got blem, man do weeded.
Shh, shh, be quite when the mandem speaking.
Fill up the hammer cause man ain't eaten.
See me with Wa Wa? Bet you didn't see him.
Need a Rihanna to work this evening.
Got Lady GaGa and I sold it to Steven.
Sold too much pack out to be in the T still dealing.
I know too much slappas to be lonely on the weekend.
This gyal ah badders, way badder than you ediats.
I know so much trappers, all now the drought, I ain't seen it.
Got so much hammers, bro smoked he's self, he's a ediat.
Dodged so much cameras, now man's man big screening.
Made so much bangers, all now man ain't released them.
Feel to let them all right now, make it inconvenient.
Gyal give me mouth, eyes closed but man'a man's peeping.
Man can make her drown.
If I send her text she gon' get wet, so man'a man's leaving.
Old school like GipSet, ain't lying about beating.
