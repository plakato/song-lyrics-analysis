Best Love Lyrics
by Yuna.


I need to know about this, babe.
Cause I can't sleep at night.
The conversation that we had.
Something just feels right.

I know we've known each other a long time.
But I've never seen you in this light.
I can see the future in your eyes.
Longing for a love and I realize.

You are the one I want.

The one I'm thinking of.

I think that we can have more.

We'll have what we deserve.

Best kind of love.
Mmm... and you know that I want it.

Best kind, best kind.

And you know.
And you know that I've got it.

You're the best kind of love.

I guess it's not too much to ask.
If you feel the same.
We can build something that will last.
No more playing games.

I know we've known each other a long time.
I never thought I'd wanna make you mine.
Call me up before you sleep at night.
I know you have me lingering in your mind.

You are the one I want.

The one I'm thinking of.

I think that we can have more.

We'll have what we deserve.

Best kind of love.
Mmm.. and you know that I want it.

Best kind, best kind.

And you know.
And you know that I've got it.

You're the best kind of love.

I want it, I want it.
I want, I want, I want, I want it.
I want, I want, I want, I want it.
I want, I want, I want, I want it.

I know we've known each other a long time.
But I've never seen you in this light.
Call me right before you sleep at night.
I know you got me lingering in your mind.

You are the one I want.

The one I'm thinking of, thinking of.

I think, I think that we can have more.

We'll have what we deserve.

Best kind of love.
Ooo... and you know that I want it.

The best kind, the best kind of love.

And you know.
And you know that I need it.

You're the best kind of love.
