Productive Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.

Rastas heard we sit back act absurd.
I guess the texts was misinterpretted, now got no choice but work with it.
The slash and burn massacre, blast the herb fast as blurs.
Lay her down in a leaf when I make the center split.
Take an eighth for wake and bake, from weight to shake I murdered it.

I love her, but keep her under cover.
My organic sweet honey won't be turned down.
Than whats in the bong water then resume the onslaught of.
But now she's even badder when I have her go swimming.
I light hash and buy quads to bypass the hurt and shit.
better grab caterpie.
That tickles when I kiss her, makes my throat go shaky.
Now a thick chick in a summer dress.
When my homie ain't home getting Matt mad at me.
Of rapper's delight shit, sounds nice as a tight chick.
A better way to waste a day then I ain't ever heard of it.
Now Mary was there for me when no one else was.
And you can see, by how I don't rhyme for others.
So I haven't even had time for other girls lately.

She keeps them in my thoughts which ironic, they say that's what she rot.
With a set of stunning breasts, would leave me unimpressed, none the less.
I keep her laced in linen way we met in the beginning.
Gave him 90 in return and burned it with the family.
I might spit bars and make a song hotter.
Or heat her up slow, hit her quick with a whip.
Sometimes brothers sympathize, I don't know why.
With her green lean body and her cute peach fuzz.
The Phillie's burning quick,.
Bump My Morning Jacket just long enough to pack it.
But I'll never stop, til the trees turn brown.

Attack it, pass it back wit, a white bic to light hits.

With a chick this fly I got no time for others.
That's my word.
For the sack he handed me.
