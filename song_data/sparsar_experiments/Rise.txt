Rise
by Rufus Rex.

There's a carrion curse forever haunting our souls.
Until the very day we're lowered in a hole.
At Stygian shores we are doomed to run underground.
Living in fear 'till our divine spark's snuffed out.

No longer will you wander aimless through the afterlife.
The Caress of a casket holds you tight.
We are destined for worms as our lives conclude.
Last rights, be dammed, death will begin renewed.

Rise, Lazorus, Rise!
Rise from the grave!
Dispel the sleep inside your veins!
Rise, Lazorus, Rise!
Rise from the tomb!
Regain your breath forever exhumed!

Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
The epitaph's wiped clean.
The tombstones ground up.
Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
No need for eulogies.
Hymn's never sung.

The motionary silence will forever be eclipsed.
With Funeral directors deprived of their scripts.
Denounce the arcane implements of the past.
Lifeless actors no longer cast.

At final curtain call there's a body in dread.
It's a shame to expire when we meet our end.
Cease your offerings to the unfortunate dead.
Silence those prayers i'll give them new life again!

Rise, Lazorus, Rise!
Rise from the grave!
Dispel the sleep inside your veins!
Rise, Lazorus, Rise!
Rise from the tomb!
Regain your breath forever exhumed!

Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
The epitaph's wiped clean.
The tombstones ground up.
Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
No need for eulogies.
Hymn's never sung.

Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
The epitaph's wiped clean.
The tombstones ground up.
Death's just the beginning!
Defy fate! Reanimate.
No need for eulogies.
Hymn's never sung.

The motionary silence will forever be eclipsed.
With Funeral directors deprived of their scripts.
Denounce the arcane implements of the past.
Lifeless actors no longer cast.
