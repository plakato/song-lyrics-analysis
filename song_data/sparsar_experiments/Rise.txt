Rise
by Rufus Rex.

There'S a carrion curse forever haunting our souls
Until the very day we're lowered in a hole
At Stygian shores. We are doomed to run underground
Living in fear'till, our divine spark's snuffed out

No longer. Will you wander aimless through the afterlife
The Caress of a casket holds you tight
We are destined for worms as our lives. Conclude
Last rights be dammed. Death will begin. Renewed

Rise Lazorus Rise 
Rise from the grave 
Dispel. The sleep inside your veins 
Rise Lazorus Rise 
Rise from the tomb 
Regain. Your breath forever exhumed 

Death's just the beginning, 
Defy fate, Reanimate
Death's, just the beginning, 
Defy fate, Reanimate
The epitaph's, wiped clean
The, tombstones, ground up
Death's. Just the beginning, 
Defy fate Reanimate
No need for eulogies
Hymn's, never sung

The motionary silence will forever be eclipsed
With. Funeral directors deprived of their scripts
Denounce. The arcane implements of the past
Lifeless actors no longer cast

At final curtain call there's a body in dread
It's a shame to expire. When we meet our end
Cease, your offerings to the unfortunate dead
Silence, those prayers i'll, give them new life again. 

Rise Lazorus Rise 
Rise from the grave 
Dispel. The sleep inside your veins 
Rise Lazorus Rise 
Rise from the tomb 
Regain, your breath forever: exhumed 

Death's, just the beginning, 
Defy fate, Reanimate
Death's, just the beginning, 
Defy fate, Reanimate
The epitaph's, wiped clean
The, tombstones, ground up
Death's, just the beginning, 
Defy fate Reanimate
No need for eulogies
Hymn's, never sung

Death's. Just the beginning, 
Defy fate Reanimate
Death's just the beginning: 
Defy fate, Reanimate
The epitaph's, wiped clean
The, tombstones, ground up
Death's, just the beginning, 
Defy fate, Reanimate
No need for eulogies
Hymn's, never sung

The motionary silence will forever be eclipsed
With. Funeral directors deprived of their scripts
Denounce, the arcane implements of the past
Lifeless actors. No longer cast
