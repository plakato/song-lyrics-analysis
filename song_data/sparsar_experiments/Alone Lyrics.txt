Alone Lyrics
by Twiztid.

All obsessed with the taste of flesh.

All obsessed with the taste of flesh.

Even though you think your alone they're always everywhere.

I must be insane, no they're always everywhere.

Further everyday yeah they're always everywhere.

Would you feel like.

Would you get high.

Its alright.

Dont even cry.

Even though you think you're alone they're always everywhere.

I must be insane, no they're always everywhere.

Further everyday yeahhhhh their always everywhere.

Sleeping to dream.

Come to sleep here.

My soul is mine.

Don't want to wait.

Even though you think you're alone they're always everywhere.

I must be insane, no they're always everywhere.

Further everyday yeah they're always everywhere.

And you don't give a shit.

If they were here with you now.

But now they live in a realm.

And when they're gone they're gone.

Even though you think you're alone they're always everywhere.

I must be insane, no they're always everywhere.

Futher everyday yeah they're always everywhere.
