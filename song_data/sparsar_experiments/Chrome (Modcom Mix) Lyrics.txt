Chrome (Modcom Mix) Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

A million faces, each a million lies.
For each and all a chrome disguise.
Prompts for action force reaction.
Embody promise in a sheen so pure.
Hurt, the measure of blind ambition.
The testament to your singular disease.
Against all wisdom you heed no warning.
Your desires giving you away.
If I could change your mind.
I wouldn't save you from the path you wander.
In desperation dreams any soul can set you free.
And I still hear you scream.
In every breath, in every single motion.
Burning innocence the fire to set you free.
Your actions turn conquest to dust.
In portents of fate you foolishly place trust.
Sense fear in your broken breathing.
Resort to shadows till your body expires.
All creation has the promise of heaven.
And still you travel the road to hell.
I'm saying nothing for the good of myself.
But I'm still talking and you're not listening.
If I could change your mind.
I wouldn't save you from the path you wander.
In desperation dreams any soul can set you free.
And I still hear you scream.
In every breath, in every single motion.
Burning innocence the fire to set you free.
As night descends upon the city.
The streets are cold, the lights go by.
And in the stories of the people.
A million faces, a million lies.
They'll never say they feel what you feel.
That they can see the world you see.
And in their faces, their expressions.
A million faces, a million lies.
