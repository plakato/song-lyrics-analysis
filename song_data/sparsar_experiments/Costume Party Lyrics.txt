Costume Party Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

You're too young, you're never gonna know.
What hit me when I fell down in silence.
No one thinks what I'm doing is the right.
Way forward, you'll see it's not just a dream now.

You think you know, you don't know.

You're too young, you're never gonna know.
What hit me when I fell down in silence.
No one thinks what I'm doing is the right.
Way forward, you'll see it's not just a dream now.

You think you know, you don't know.

It's what you get when you try to educate.
A black sheep, you can't, you won't, you never will.
I'm gonna show you what it takes to see.
The future, it's hard but not impossible.

And I believe this costume party is over.
Before it gets started.
And I believe this costume party is over.

And I believe this costume party is over.
Before it gets started.
And I believe this costume party is over.
