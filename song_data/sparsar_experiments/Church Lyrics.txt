Church Lyrics
by Zip K..


When I come in with the fade.
Thou shalt not throw shade.
Thou shalt not be snitching.
Thou shalt never say no names.
All I ever do is hear about these other niggas till I see um for I eat um say.
grace.
Sittin in the pue with the hunned face blue in other words I'm just tryna save.
face.
You with the bad boys and ya name gettin.
Biggie so u know you gotta keep a lil faith.
You gotta have faith.
All my niggas know you gotta have faith.
Always a new face in my face.
Cause The way I spits Triple H.
My future looking a like a bunch of money in the open.
Everybody just wanna feel safe.

Thou shalt get it yo damn self.

Know I'm due for a patty melt.
Sanctuary fulla hypocrites &amp;.
I remember how bad it felt.
Juugin' til I'm whipp a Holy Ghost and now I know.
How my pastor felt.

We been through up and downs up and downs.
When we juug around.
When we get it in get it in.
Ain't no pullin out.
And I never hesitate.
To rack up that collection plate.
And ooh I'm bout to take um to church.
Ohh I'm bout to take um to church.

Now when I come thru with the play.
Thou shall not delay.
Thou shall keep it 2 plus 98 oh.
Thou shall rack up that collection plate.
Oh.
Thou shall not be antsy when you know it's best to wait.
Nigga it's too much at steak uh.
Counting my blessings tellin my niggas count on me and countin this money.
I just pray my bill collector lose count for me.
And my Whip sittin high.
Cuz that's where God want me.
The flow is near God so Imma fear God only.
I feel tired of the pressure since I've survived My homies.
In the pue with a few we know work at pink pony.
Imma do what I do.
I do it with God before me.
And everyday I pray God don't ignore me.
Amen.
