INtro (15) Lyrics
by Xavier Crimson.


Done with the small talk,I'm chatting with some demons now.
Police sirens blaring,someone must have let them heathens out.
Come a long way, since I was at drew freeman,wow.
Sessions at the spot, pass the ma'fucking weed around.
Keep spiting amateur until the flow deepens,how.
Could it, I'm already waist deep inside excretion now.
Her mouth open, buried in the semen, guess we even now.

Niggas rarely gave a fuck,.
confided in my pad and pen.
Father say he love me tell where that nigga at then?
