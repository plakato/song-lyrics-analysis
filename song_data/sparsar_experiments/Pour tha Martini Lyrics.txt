Pour tha Martini Lyrics
by Wu Block.

“Fourth quarter time…”.

Clarks is lighty scuffed, need a new pair.
Jacob Javits Center, Wu and Snoop there.
D-Block pull up, olive green drops.
The interior suede, cuz that's boss crock.
Air fresheners hang, the joint is sold out.
To capacity, this young bitch keep asking me.
“Can I suck your dick?”, “Not now, shorty”.
“Maybe after the show, just hold fast for me”.
Ferocious bangles, birds on both arms.
I'm jew-eled out like a box of Lucky Charms.
On stage, two treadmills, a pull-up bar.
Involved with the lights to give it that red feel.
Feeling like Bruce Wayne, making up for never making the prom.
Ma, you chilling? The belt glow in the dark.
Where my aunt stays, batteries gone.
That's when I pull a forty out for Ason.

Wu-Block, I'm from a gun play habitat.
Let me run into Nicki, I'm smashing that.
What you know about the ratchet in your mother mouth.
Killah banging the neck, with two rubbers out.

Interlude: Sheek Louch.

Shout out to Ason.
Aiyo, Ghost, I'm going in, family.
Feel me, son.

Sheek and Ghost Deini, aiyo, Cap, pour that bitch a martini.
Loosen her up, fuck it, pour Goose in her cup.
Tell her chill, cuz the Gods is here.
Big money in this place, I'm balling when I'm leaving out of Chase.
Red diamonds on a Freddy Kruger face.
I don't get pat down, you know what's on the waist.
I don't mean jazz when I say I count base.
Fly Louis sneakers, Purple Tape coming out the speakers.
Bumped into my high school teachers.
They said I wouldn't be nothing, sitting on the bleachers.
Now I'm sitting in the Phantom, trynna figure out the features.
I'm a big fish now, I watch for the leeches.

Aiyo, I jump on stage with my dick in my hand.
I'm a Park Hill nigga, straight from Shaolin.
New York is the borough where I pump my rocks at.
Bitch ass niggas where I dump my Glocks at.
I don't have to get dip, I'm known and flossy.
I'm known everywhere like Remedy Rossy.
Never say shit, I'm hard and cocky.
Too hot for these tracks, wash this summer.
Go hard for the hood from Allentown to Sumner.
Yeah, nigga, what, I'm just one of us.
For all my jail niggas, that feel wondrous.
Fuck a fat bitch, with a thunder butt.
Mad groupie love, too caliente.
Mahogany, polly with Sin Jay.
My nigga Ghost Rider, King Sheek Louch.
I'm in the fly spotlight with that Papoose.
