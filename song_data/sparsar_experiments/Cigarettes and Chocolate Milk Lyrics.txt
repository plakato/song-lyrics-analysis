Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.


Cigarettes and chocolate milk
These are just a couple of my cravings
Everything. It seems I like's a little bit stronger
A little bit thicker a little bit harmful for me

If. I should buy jellybeans
Have to eat them all in just one sitting
Everything. It seems I like's a little bit sweeter
A little bit fatter a little bit harmful for me

And. Then there's those other things
Which for several reasons we won't mention
Everything about'em is a little bit stranger
A little bit harder. A little bit. Deadly

It isn't very smart
Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

Sitting. Here, remembering me
Always been a shoe made for the city
Go head, accuse me of just singing about places
With scrappy boys faces have general run of the town

Playing with prodigal sons
Takes. A lot of sentimental valiums
Can't expect the world to be your Raggedy Andy
While running on empty you. Little old doll with a frown

You got to keep in the game
Retaining mystique, while facing forward
I suggest a reading of A Lesson in Tightropes
Or Surfing Your High hopes or Adios Kansas

Still. There'S not a show on my back
Holes or a friendly intervention
I'm, just a little bit heiress a little bit Irish, a little bit
Tower of Pisa. Whenever I see ya
So, please be kind if I'm a mess

Cigarettes and chocolate milk
Cigarettes and chocolate milk
