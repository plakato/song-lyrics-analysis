Radio Lyrics
by Tyler Rich.


I heard our song again last night.
It's like a one way ticket on a lonely ride.
To your memory.
Mama said son, it's gonna take some time.
To forget her face when I hear those lines.
And that melody.

Sometimes, I sit here all day.
Trying like hell to forget the pain.
But I'm waiting for the same damn song to play.

I wanna hold you close.
Never wanna let you go.
Every time I hear a song on the radio.
Every time I hear a song I already know.
I'm gonna call you up.
Dead of the night.
Praying somebody ain't there holding you tight.
Only love I've ever known.
Is still alive in this radio.
Still alive in this radio.

Tried to write a new song today.
But every single word spelled out your name.
Am I losing it?
Daddy said son, you better turn the page.
Ain't no picture perfect in a broken frame.
It's just foolishness.

When I'm sitting here all night.
And all day.
Writing like hell just to kill the pain.
And I'm singing that same damn song again.

I wanna hold you close.
Never wanna let you go.
Every time I hear a song on the radio.
Every time I hear a song I already know.
I'm gonna call you up.
Dead of the night.
Praying somebody ain't there holding you tight.
Only love I've ever known.
Is still alive in this radio.
Still alive, still alive in this radio.

And I'm waiting for the same damn song to play.

I wanna hold you close.
Never wanna let you go.
It's just all that same damn song.
So play it all night long.
I'm gonna call you up.
Dead of the night.
Praying somebody ain't there holding you tight.
The only love I've ever known.
Still alive in this radio.

Still alive in this radio.

I heard our song again tonight.
It's like a one way ticket on a lonely ride.
To your memory.
