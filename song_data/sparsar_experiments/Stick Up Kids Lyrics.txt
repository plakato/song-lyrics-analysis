Stick Up Kids Lyrics
by Wu Block.

.
Keep taking about that money.
Ima stick 'em.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stick 'em.
Send a bitch home wit him.
Let her tell us where to get him.
Got the hollows in that ruger.
Im looking at your chains.
Cause them diamond look clearer.
Than that water in Aruba.
You ain't even gotta jack 'em.
You barely need a gun.
You can walk up and smack 'em.
They so soft.
Then you got the rats.
That fact should be up north.
Donnie on his bullshit.
Mask and a full clip.
Hoppin' out the whip.
I'mma stick 'em.
Ha, ha, ha stick 'em.
Lay him down on the floor.
My mans at the door.
My other homie downstairs.
Hand on the 4.
I ain't even gotta koll em.
I'm just coming for that raw.
.
My daughter said stick 'em.
Mama said stick 'em.
My son said daddy if he move.
I'mma lick 'em.
My grandmother go to church.
To pray on my victims she say.
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em.
.
Ya know I'mma slim nigga.
From a large family.
The burner get passed.
Around the crew like a grammy.
My little man with autusim.
He looked at me.
And looked at duke and said stick 'em.
Why ya looking at me stick 'em.
I hope you remove the body.
But where we gonna ship 'em.
Fuck it I just draw a door to me duck.
Cut the jewels.
He said ship me, I'm not giving it up.
Word! Awe shit!.
Its gonna be a long day.
Her maid just got enough.
Maps for this hallway.
Home still smelling like ajax.
Ripped the Jules off his neck.
Like chill par relax.
Understand it came through.
C alar ripped him.
Doc had to staple his face.
Straight victim.
This how we do it in Staten.
We hardly get caught with our hoodies off.
Let alone a ratchet.
.
My daughter said stick 'em.
Mama said stick 'em.
My son said daddy if he move.
I'mma lick 'em.
My grandmother go to church.
To pray on my victims she say.
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em.
.
Get my hand on the hawk I'mma stick 'em.
Aids needle I'mma stick 'em.
Got the red nose off the leash.
Can't wait to sic 'em.
Usually make 'em take it off.
Slow when I strip 'em.
Prolly better to kill 'em.
Cause he can't take the whipping.
Consider it charity.
Vvs clarity.
ARA is the armed robbers academy.
Put it in the bag.
I don't care its waever homes.
Big shit, all the way.
Down to the heron bones.
Credit cards, debit cards.
Everybody get god.
Wedding bands, birthstones.
Camouflage, earth tones.
Yea my cloth is cut different.
It don't cost nothing.
To just listen.
But if not I'mma burrr stick 'em.
Ha ha ha stick 'em.
.
My daughter said stick 'em.
Mama said stick 'em.
My son said daddy if he move.
I'mma lick 'em.
My grandmother go to church.
To pray on my victims she say.
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em.
