Light Shines in all Wonder (Diss) Lyrics
by Wonderstarz.


When you find no path.
And darkness is surrounding ya.
Believe in light- cause it will lead you.
To ultimate victory.
Over Darkness...
Light wins all the way.
Light shines in wonder.

Sponny...
Here along with Wonderstarz.
That's right- let's go!

Make single notes in one piece and no peace.
Sit on streets, and die trumpetin' to these beats.
Golden fleece? Goose grease? More the hell like a press release.
Oh! I almost forgot I was rhymin' the UFO.
Floor show! Cause I go pro on mics, to-and-fro.
It's a strip show bitches, electric glow.
Maybe a charity throw, but damn a turbulent flow.
Okay- one last chance though-.
Go ahead, take a free penalty yo.
I spit slow, ho? It was 15 years ago.
Mo'fuck! I was the doctor who called ya sick.
Cause ya dick was rock-hard when you were born you prick.
Oil slick!
Conjuring tricks?
Look at ya- the devil's walkin' stick.
Real politik, politics?
I'm an American dog tick.

).

Now listen everyone- I'm grabbin' your attention.
Cause this is our competition.

The mofos- kill 'em with one blow.
And we know how fucked up this game is- No hope!
Skycreepin' in ya asses like there's a fog in ya brain dog.
Mock, fuck? Enough! This shit's dough- to get hanged rough.

You're shit to us- why?
Cause we tough.
Deepdax should wax his dick cause his nickname's Richard.
He's fully grown up without a fuckin' teacher.
His ass's too white- looks like it's imported.
And Darkness scumbag can't reveal he ain't potent.
Sinned Spirit is so sinned he can't get out.
On Sundays, or Mondays , or whenever he's gonna give birth.
Run 'way.
Die bitches die- it's Friday the 13th.
I'll kill ya ghosts like I was Bill Murphy.
And you know we are the VIP.

Don't teach me pain Dax, I've had three bottles of champagne- it's profane.
After detain, these three bitches remain.
Acid rain on all three! Capital gain.
Cut ya interior jugular vein  again and again- like frickin' chowmein.

Don't abstain, cause it's all in vain...
Betrayal? MC's was like a frickin' portrayal of Slim Mathers.
Cigars? Lamar's? Nah! all ours.
We mark our territory gays.
You stand and stare.
Be surprised at our ways-.
Rephrase today's maze and turn it onto the surface.
It's anal phase.
R.Hayes.
couldn't do shit.
Cause this game pays, I just got a raise-  yes!
What 'bout you stray dogs.
How much do y'all three weigh?
