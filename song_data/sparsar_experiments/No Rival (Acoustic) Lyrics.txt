No Rival (Acoustic) Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

Fight the good fight,  attempt for the brave.
This trek for the lost has brought more than a grave.
Bathed in the fire for you hope water's pure.
The flames will grow higher it's taste is your cure.
I do not fear the world's fire for it  burns for a moment.
And though it sears my skin I rest for it shall relent.
With the world at your feet and the fire on your back.
It has nothing to give me for You've claimed my soul.
No sacrifice could be too great.
Some think I've lost my mind abandoned sanity.
To speak of truth to find a saving clarity.
For it will cost my/your life.
Forsaking comfort and ease to trade it all for a heart with no rival.
You will be met with strife.
And make you fall to your knees we'll trade it all for a heart with no rival.
Throw all your hate and your wrath into the fire and.
Cast all your pain and your fear unto the graces.
Of our God and King for the evil will attack.
Suffer for His love for it  burns for a moment.
With the world at your feet and fire on your back.
For the God above, for His grace will not relent.
No sacrifice could be too great.
Fight the good fight, you know you must be brave.
This trek for the lost to save.
Eighteen years I have served the Lord.
And He has never let me down.
For it will cost your life.
Forsaking comfort and ease to trade it all for a heart with no rival.
You will be met with strife.
And make you fall to your knees we'll trade it all for a heart with no rival.
Expect suffering and invite all the pain.
Lord you have changed me and I am not the same.
Hebrews 13:6; I Corinthians 6:20, 7:23, I Peter 4:12-19, 5:7; II Corinthians.
