Evergreen Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Red shoes go sailing.
Through the trees.
Leaving no traces at all.
Not even a scattering in the leaves.
The reflections are only memories.

Evergreen, lay down beside me.
Evergreen, Evergreen.
Evergreen.
Make me feel whole again.
Help me undo these chains, my love.
Evergreen never says.
Nothing that's mean.
Evergreen.
Evergreen, my love.
My love.

It might be easy.
To judge all that kindness.
If you had grown accustomed.
To the darkness in the light.
But certainly any room.
With a view of other windows.
Must have doors that you can use.
So you can be happy.
For the first time in your life.
Amen, it's your destiny.
It can start anytime.
And maybe you'll find someone.
To lay some roots down next to you.
And be more like the trees.
And less like the clouds.
Stop moving around so much.

Evergreen, lay down beside me.
Evergreen.
Evergreen.
Evergreen, make me feel whole again.
Help me undo these chains, my love.
Evergreen, lay down beside me.
Evergreen.
Evergreen, make me feel whole again.
Help me undo these chains, my love.
Evergreen never says.
Nothing that's mean.
Evergreen.
Evergreen, my love.
My love.
