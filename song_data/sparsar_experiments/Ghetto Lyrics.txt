Ghetto Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

Born in the gutter.
In the shadow of an alley.
I was born in the last state of disaster.

Out there can you hear me.
Out there can you hear me.
Lord, there's so much pain.
No, no I can't stand the pain.

Can you see fuckers.
That try to separate us.
The weak from the strong.
The worse from better ones.
From those who're up.
Those who're down.
Those who see from those who're blind.

Ghetto.
You're building up a ghetto.

Loud, louder.
The scream's getting louder.
Can't stand the pain.
That I'm keeping under.
I face reality, sick, sick reality.
False ideas, broken morality.

Out there can you hear me.
Out there can you hear me.
Lord, there's so much pain.
No, no I can't stand the pain.

Can you see the fuckers.
That try to separate us.
The weak from the strong.
The worse from better ones.
Those from the East.
And those from the West.
Those who don't have.
From those who have.
