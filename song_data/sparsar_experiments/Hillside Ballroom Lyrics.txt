Hillside Ballroom Lyrics
by Ruse.

Hesitate.
This hillside ballroom starts to dissipate and dislocate.
A broken heart.
This night time high is driven off, I got stood up.
Still can't taste the wine, sweeter on the vine.
Dirty hands, not coming clean.
Sigh, sigh help me out in here.
Lie whisper in my ear.
It's a lonely ride.
Behind the doors where all the people hide, start the slide.
Empty space.
Light alone won't fill this place.
Fuck this place.
Lines upon the skin, changing from within.
Tired eyes, won't go blind.
Sigh, sigh help me out in here.
Lie whisper in my ear.
And when I fall will anybody hear.
Sigh, help me out in.
Sigh, sigh help me out in here.
Lie whisper in my ear.
And when I fall will anybody hear.
Sigh, help me out in.
