A Warrior's Call Lyrics
by Volbeat.

Let's get ready to rumble.

Feel the fire, he's entering the ring.
His mindset only know how to win.
This Danish fighter will break you in two.
You will feel all his power.

The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler will now brand his name.
In the back of your head, you'll feel the floor again.
Unleashing his Hell, you will not even hear the bell.
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand chance.

Feel the power of a warrior.
Fight, fight, fight, fight.
Let's get ready to rumble.
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

Breaking your record and breaking your bones.
Born a warrior with a code.
A champion feeding your face with a fist.
You will feel all his power.

The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler will now brand his name.
In the back of your head, you'll feel the floor again.
Unleashing his Hell, you will not even hear the bell.
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand chance.

Feel the power of a warrior.
Fight, fight, fight, fight.
Let's get ready to rumble.
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

Fight, fight, fight, fight.
Feel the pain tomorrow.

Behold, here comes the son.
Believe it, he was born to be the chosen one.
The call is for a warrior.
His name will echo on the sea and on the ground.
Feel the fire, he's entering the ring.
His mindset only know how to win.
This Danish fighter will break you in two.
You will feel all his power.

The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler will now brand his name.
In the back of your head, you'll feel the floor again.
Unleashing his Hell, you will not even hear the bell.
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand chance.

Feel the power of a warrior.
Fight, fight, fight, fight.
Let's get ready to rumble.
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

Fight, fight, fight, fight.
Feel the pain tomorrow.

Behold, here comes the son.
Believe it, he was born to be the chosen one.
The call is for a warrior.
His name will echo on the sea and on the ground.
