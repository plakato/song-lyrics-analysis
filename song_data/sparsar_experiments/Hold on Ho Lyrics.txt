Hold on Ho Lyrics
by UNK.


Hold on hoe, hold on hold on hold on hoe - AYYY~! {*4X*}.

Don't run up on me like you know me player - hold on hoe.
I'm smokin kush you on that reggie - hold on hoe.
Them diamonds ain't real, tuck your chain in - hold on hoe.
Ay, ay back back, I'ma do my thang then - hold on hoe.

Unk.
Ol' bitch-ass nigga make me laugh, can't even bust Welch's grape.
My fault they hoes in my face, I pump they mouths just like weights.
I blowin kush it tastes great, come 50 deep like the mob.
I'm stackin stack after stack, so haters get on your job.
I'm callin shot after shot, whether you like it or not.
You try to jack what I got, I'll bust yo' ass on the spot.
Come try me, I see ye ain't hard without'cha boys huh?
Unlock them toys and bring the noise huh?

Baby D.
Ay hold on hoe, hold on hoe, don't be walkin up on on me too fast.
Lookin slick, talkin slick, but ain't no sucker for no ass.
Look at the J's up on my feet, and the suede up on my seats.
Check out the shades up on my face bitch! I ain't cheap.
Hold on hoe, hold on hoe, I done told you once befo'.
That I don't be rappin fast, these niggas just listen slow.
So hit the blunt twice and, keep it movin steady.
We smokin purple kush bitch, this ain't no motherfuckin reggie.
I'm in the A! Hold on hoe, hold on hold on hoe.
All day! I put on hoe, put on put on hoe.
You see the stacks in my pocket, the Oomp Camp gettin bigger.
I'm Baby D, or you can call me that nigga.

Parlae.
Now hold on hoe, who gon' be the next to go?
Who gon' be the next to blow? Give a nigga extra throat.
I'm the next to blow, my jewelry got a extra glow.
Look at my chain bitch, my diamonds made by eskimos.
I got extra dough, I got a cold wrist.
Look at my pinky ring, my ears look like froze piss.
How much yo' chain? How my much my chain? That's a whole brick.
I leave these hoes sick, my right wrist look like froze Crist'.
I know this - we the motherfuckin shit~!
Oomp Camp and Franchize in this fuckin bitch.
Hold on hoe, hold on hold on hold on hoe.
