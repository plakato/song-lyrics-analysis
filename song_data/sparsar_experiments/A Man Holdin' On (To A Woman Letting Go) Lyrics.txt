A Man Holdin' On (To A Woman Letting Go) Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.

Two young lovers with their bodies on fire 
Achin' to swim: that river of desire, 
Leavin' innocence there on the bank by their clothes, 
A man, holdin' on to a woman, lettin' go 
 
There's a man with a bottle on the other side of town 
Swimmin' with a Mem-Ry that he can't drown 
Lord it ain't sunk in that she ain't, comin', home 
A man, holdin' on to a woman, lettin' go .
 
His heart is tellin him 
To, hang on for dear life, 
Cuz deep down. He knows 
She's lettin' go for good this time. 
 
There's, a daddy walkin', his daughter down the aisle 
Fightin' back tears and forcin' a smile 
For 22 years he's watched her grow 
A man holdin' on to a woman, lettin' go 
In the hill valley home there's a feeble old man. 
And he's holdin' on to a fragile old hand. 
And the angels are comin' to carry her home. 
Now he's a man holdin' on to a woman. Lettin' go 
,
