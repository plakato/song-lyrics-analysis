ZIPPO RAID Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.

One bluebird.
Now it's dead.
One through its head.
Robbin's gettin' fed bread crumbs.
Smoked out, toss the gun.
Outta luck.
Outta sight.
Turn the fuck off the headlights.
I wanna run, hide &amp; flee.
From my misery.
I beg and plea to be someone not me.
But I know it's only me.
In this place behind my face.
My happy haze fills the room.
I have to zoom far away.
Inta' space.
Fuck your race, pussy.
A KABAR makes us all gushy.
We all die the same.
Feel the same pain.
Deal the same grain.
My mind's insane.
Can't complain though.
Got the ho beggin' for mo'.
In the '86 whip, seats all ripped, police hate the shit.
Grin, take a hit for my team and gas ya.
Bass up to 10 blast ya.
Don't mind me none.
Pistol whip ya for fun.
Zippo raid the blunt.
Stone face rape the nun.
Biggest honey buns in my dreams.
Not even on the fuckin' rap scene.
Just a stupid kid tryna sound mean.
But it ain't workin'.
Guess I gotta start berzerkin' through the streets.
Patched-up bloody jeans, work boots.
Hide em with the looty.
Hop back in the whip.
Pick up my little beauty.
Keep the maverick gripped.
Cause I gotta stay shooty and on the run.
I never said i loved ya, hun.
But you know you're perfect.
So keep fuckin workin' it.
'Fore I flash way back and start burnin' it.
Torches, it's the zippo raid enforcers.
Comin through.
Ready for me.
Ready for you.
Aimin true.
Brain stew.
Holy fuck, they shot Lou and I don't even know what the fuck I'm gonna do.

Do you?
I'unno.
I don't have a fuckin' clue.
I'm only eighteen.. The only one doin' any of this shit.
It's all me.
