Angels We Have Heard On High Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Angels we have heard on high.
Sweetly singing over the plains.
And the mountains in reply.
Echoing their joyous strains.
Glo-ori-a.
In excelsis de-o.
Glo-ori-a.
In excelsis de-o.

Shepherds, why this Jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be.
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Glo-ori-a.
In excelsis de-o.
Glo-ori-a.
In excelsis de-o.

Come to Bethlehem and see.
Him whose birth the angels sing;.
Come, adore on bended knee.
Christ, the Lord.
The newborn King.
Glo-ori-a.
In excelsis de-o.
Glo-ori-a.
In excelsis de-o.

See Him in a manger laid.
Jesus, Lord of heaven and earth!
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid.
With us sing our Savior's birth.
Glo-ori-a.
In excelsis de-o.
Glo-ori-a.
In excelsis de-o.
