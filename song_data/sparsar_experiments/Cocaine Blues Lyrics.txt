Cocaine Blues Lyrics
by Woody Guthrie.

It was late last night I made my rounds.
I met my woman and I blowed her down.
I went on home and I went to bed.
I laid my pistol up under my head.

Early next morning by the rising sun.
I woke up and I started to run.
I made a run, but I run too slow.
A man overtook me down in Jericho.

I was standing on the corner reading my daddy's will.
Along come a man, they called him Bad Texas Bill.
He said Captain, is your name Lee Brown?
I believe that you're the rascal blowed your woman down..

I said Yes sir, Captain, my name is Lee.
And if you've got any blues, boy, sing 'em to me..
Well I guess, Lee, that you know the best.
You'd better come go with me, the judge'll tell you the rest..

When I was arrested, I was dressed in black.
They put me on a train and they brung me back.
Jury found me guilty in the first degree.
And they laid me down in the penitentiary.

Yes, the judge found me guilty and the jury too.
Cried, Lord in heaven, have some mercy on me!
I'll be here for the rest of my life.
All I done was kill my wife.
