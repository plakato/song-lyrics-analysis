Let 'Em Know Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


Roll up the dro po' up the fo' 
Calling, all my thug niggas time to hit the flo' 
 
Roll up the dro po' up the fo' 
Calling, all my thug niggas time to hit the flo'. Let em know 
You bout, your bidness and you ain't gon play 
, you out the gutter and you come up handling weight. 
 see it's whatever man plexing, never settles. Man 
 get on our level. Man. We up out the ghetto man 
 
D-Gotti 
Off top. I came from the block: 
I came with a Glock, so don't get body rocked 
Got it hot. Yes, sir blowing on the best, sir 
And, your girl on my thang cause. I beat it up on the dresser
