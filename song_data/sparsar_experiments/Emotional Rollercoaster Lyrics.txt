Emotional Rollercoaster Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


Last night, I cried, tossed and turned.
Woke up with dry eyes.
My mind was racing.
Feet were pacing.
Lord, help me please.
Tell me what I have gotten into.

Ran my three miles to clear my mind.
It always helps me out.
It's my therapy.
When I'm losing it which is usually.

I'm on a emotional rollercoaster.
Loving you ain't nothing healthy.
Loving you was never good for me.
But I can't get off.

It's emotional rollercoaster.
Loving you ain't nothing healthy.
Loving you was never good for me.
But I can't get off.

Yesterday, I told myself.
I was gonna be okay.
Gonna start a new day.
Be truly happy.
I was gonna take control of me.

But eventually reality hit me.
Mentally, physically, emotionally.
And I opened my eyes and realized.
That I was still being.
Taken for a constant ride on your.

So tired of you making love to me.
Then disappearing so suddenly.
Up and down it goes.

And I'm so tired of you pacifying me.
With promises you know.
That you'll never keep.
Round and round it goes.
