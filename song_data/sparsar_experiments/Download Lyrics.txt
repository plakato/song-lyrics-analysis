Download Lyrics
by Sway UK.


Yo, Sway. Uh Ha.
Shout Out To The Whole After Shock Cru. And This One Here Is For The Kids.
You Know How We Rep.
Don't Play Around.

Stop The Download.

People Don't Wanna Pay For C.D's.
Now Every Other House Holds Got P.C's.
They Download On Mp3's.
People Please Be Reasonable.
How Am I Gonna Make My G's.
If You Got My Album Before The Release.
The Quality's Rubbish And There Ain't No Sleeves.
Do You Deem That Feasible?

Warning Who On The World Wide Web Theres A New Craze Thats Sweepin The Flo'.
I Heard They Play Me On The Radio Every Day So I Hope That I Go Platinum Or.
Gold.
I'm Almost F-A-Mous, R-A's Know That My N-A-Me Is Sway Cuz There Saying It.
Every Where.
On The Week Of My Release I'm Looking At The Charts.
I'm Looking For My Name But I Can't See It Anywhere.
Now I'm On The Phone All Angry And That There Must Be Something Wrong.
All The Record Shops Say I Ain't Sold One Record But Every Body Knows My Song.
I'm All Confused And Blaming Everyone.
On The Dog And Bone And I'm Naming.
Everyone.
Deep Breath, Tablets, Glass Of Evian.
What Went Wrong? I'm Asking Everyone.

People Don't Wanna Pay For C.D's.
Now Every Other House Holds Got P.C's.
They Download On Mp3's.
People Please Be Reasonable.
How Am I Gonna Make My G's.
If You Got My Album Before The Release.
The Quality's Rubbish And There Ain't No Sleeves.
Do You Deem That Feasible?

I Need To Get To The Bottom Of This.
Whoever's At The Bottoms At The Top Of My List.
All This Downloading's Flopping My Shhh, I Ain't Gonna Swear Not Even A.
Whisper.
I'm Tryna Be On Top Of The Pops In This Bi-I-I.
With A Big Ben Look-A-Like Watch On My Wrist.
If I Catch Who's At The Bottom Of This.
Ima Pesh Per Pesh To The Top Of My List.
Excuse Me Bro I Don't Mean To Brown.

He Turns Around Like Bla Bla Bla.
Bla Bla Bla Some Bloke Called Kazaa,.
That Must Be The Guy That's Stealing.
Everyones Music Ima Go See Him.
Eye For An Eye If He Keeps On Stealing I'll Start Releasing Weak Lp's Then.
So I Walks Into This Internet Caf'.
Has Any Body Seen K-K-K-K-Kazaa.
But Everybody Looks B-B-B-B-Bizarre.
And They Act Like I'm Invisible.
Dont Make Me Get Physical.
Cuz If I Catch K-K-K-K-Kazaa.
Ima G-G-Go B-B-B-B-Bezerk Til They Put Me In A Prison Like Mystikal.

People Dont Wanna Pay For C.D's.
Now Every Other House Holds Got P.C's.
They Download On Mp3's.
People Please Be Reasonable.
How Am I Gonna Make My G's.
If You Got My Album Before The Release.
The Quality's Rubbish And There Ain't No Sleeves.
Do You Deem That Feasible?

I J-J-Just Found Out That Kazaas Not A Man.
Its You, The Listener, You Are But A Man.
Don't Worry Bout Me I'm A Star In The Making.
Watch This Space, I Ain't Half Got A Plan.
People Steal Faster Now They Got Broadband.
All These Websites That's My Main Threat.
Now They Got Broadband People Steal Faster.
You Can Get Songs That Ain't Even Made Yet.
Keep It On The Downlow I Download Too.
I'm A Big Hypocrite And I'll Download You.
But I Don't Want You To Download Me.
Cuz I Work Very Hard And The Downloads Free.
The Industry's Sick And It Needs A Surgeon.
All These Major Labels Are Merging.
All These Independants Emerging.
In HMV, Tower Records Or Virgin.

People Dont Wanna Pay For C.D's.
Now Every Other House Holds Got P.C's.
They Download On Mp3's.
People Please Be Reasonable.
How Am I Gonna Make My G's.
If You Got My Album Before The Release.
The Quality's Rubbish And There Ain't No Sleeves.
Do You Deem That Feasible?

Uk All The Way.
You Know How We Do.

Its Not A Problem.
Cuz Im Already A Millionaire In Ghana.
