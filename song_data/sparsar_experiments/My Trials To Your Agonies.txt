My Trials To Your Agonies
by Wolves At The Gate.

They felt your wounds they saw your scars.
Still faithless eyes plagued their minds.
You've kept Your word as I've ruined mine.
I'm finding out.

I watched the world die resting in flames.
And though I still try God you beckon me.
This beast tears at my throat over and over again.
Again and again I can't keep this flame from igniting.

So when the smoke clears away you'll find out that you're alive.
And though the fire still burns we're finding out.

Keep your eyes on the skies.
The judgment is coming.
This flame will start the fires of retribution.
He will rip this wretched beast from my heart.
And I will be free.
I will be free.
I will be free from this torment.
I will never be the same again.

I watched my world fall out of my hands.
And to my knees crawl to you.
I watched my world die resting in flames.
And though I still try God you beckon me.
All I am and all I have I give to You.
You have called me to be more than I am.

I'll give my life as You gave Yours.
I'm finding out.
Look to the skies it will come when you least expect it.
Keep your eyes on Him.
So take me from myself to Yours.
For God you've chosen me to be Your son.
