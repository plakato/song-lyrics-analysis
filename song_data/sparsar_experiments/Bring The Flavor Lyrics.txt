Bring The Flavor Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.

Who brings the flavor?
That's me, that's me.
Who brings the flavor?
That's me. I got it.

Oh no, it's a scandal.
I drop upon the mic like an anvil.
And they'll praise me.
For mad thoughts, I'm crazy.
I'm searchin'.
Lookin' for the target.
You don't know what hard is.
This ain't all this hard yet.
But I don't wanna be hard.
I just wanna flow.
Cause rhymin' is my game.
And I play it like a pro.
So what?
You want to know my name?
Dana Elaine.
All hail the queen acclaimed.
Drive you insane.
Woman with a brain.
I'm a Flavor Unit MC.
And that means I'm one of the roughest.
Def-est, toughest, best-est.
Wickedest MCs rappers in the place.
But if you try get swift?
I'mma punch you in your face.
I'm a higher flier.
Why you wanna cry?
I'm already hot, so put me in the fire.
Give me a pen and pad and it's over.
Bye-ya!
See ya later, alligator.
Hey D, bring the flavor.

Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor, bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor.

I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!

Yup, yup, yup.
I be Latifah on the mic and.
When I'm rhymin' don't you call my bluff.
Because I hate it when I have to get dangerous.
It divides, it loosens, and it weakens and it changes us.
You want more? Sure.
I fill you up like Texaco.
I switch to Spanish.
And rock it from here to Mexico.
Record go, yo.
Watch the pro.
Let me flow.
I'm raking in the dough on the down low.
So me no know.
Don't get me riled.
I get wick-wick-wild.
Flex styles by the pile.
So smile for awhile.
Aware, my dearâ€”.

That the flavor's in the air.
Oh yeah.

The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air.
Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor.
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!

Peep me cause I'm not sneaky or freaky on the mic.
I just grab it, grip it, rip it right.
And the girls know it.
And the guys know it.
I'll put your best to a test.
Wanna bet you'll blow it?
I'll smoke you like a cigarette.
Just give me the mic.
I'll give you wreck.
And save your idle threats for the next rap.
I'll take it without the cream.
So leave it black.
But you can leave the sugar.
So I can make green-like-a-booger money.
In the bank.
No need for actin' stank.
It's a sad thing to watch you get gassed like a tank.
And spank.
Look at the intelligent female I N I.
Don't try it.
You know I don't buy it.
Now, uh, if your get-up-and-go.
Done got up and gone.
I wrote this song.
So you can rock the hip-hop all night long.
So I want a gigawatt in the back of your Jeep.
So I can blast the shoes off your crusty feet.

It's like this, it's like this, it's like this, it's like this.
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!

Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor.
