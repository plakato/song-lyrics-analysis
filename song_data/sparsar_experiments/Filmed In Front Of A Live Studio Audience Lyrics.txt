Filmed In Front Of A Live Studio Audience Lyrics
by United Nations.


Sympathies 
DOWN THEN THEY'RE UP AGAIN. 
We WO N'T SEE YOU THIS TIME. Next YEAR, 
UNLESS THE SPONSORS COME THROUGH 
AND, THE MONEY STARTS. Pouring IN., 
 
I COULD SWEAR SOMEONE'S BEEN WATCHING ME 
I HEAR SOMETHING OUTSIDE 
IT MOVES IN MY DREAMS: 
AT THE EDGES OF SLEEP. 
 
ARE, YOU SAD 
DO, YOU SLEEP IN YOUR ROOM AT NIGHT 
DO. You NEED PILLS FOR YOUR MOODS 
OR, SOMEONE TO HOLD YOU 
BECAUSE. We KNOW HOW IT FEELS 
WHEN THE SOUNDS OF THEIR LAUGHTER, 
AND, THE TV'S COLD GLOW 
FOLLOWS, YOU HOME, 
TO, THE ROOM WHERE YOU SLEEP, ALL ALONE.
