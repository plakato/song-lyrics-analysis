Filmed In Front Of A Live Studio Audience Lyrics
by United Nations.

:.
SYMPATHIES:.
DOWN THEN THEY'RE UP AGAIN.
WE WON'T SEE YOU THIS TIME NEXT YEAR.
UNLESS THE SPONSORS COME THROUGH.
AND THE MONEY STARTS POURING IN..
:.
I COULD SWEAR SOMEONE'S BEEN WATCHING ME.
I HEAR SOMETHING OUTSIDE.
IT MOVES IN MY DREAMS.
AT THE EDGES OF SLEEP..
:.
ARE YOU SAD?
DO YOU SLEEP IN YOUR ROOM AT NIGHT?
DO YOU NEED PILLS FOR YOUR MOODS?
OR SOMEONE TO HOLD YOU?
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IT FEELS.
WHEN THE SOUNDS OF THEIR LAUGHTER.
AND THE TV'S COLD GLOW.
FOLLOWS YOU HOME.
TO THE ROOM WHERE YOU SLEEP ALL ALONE..
