Chivalry Lyrics
by Ruse.


Crazy written the Joker, wrote it., Take your pickin 
Miss out on a great poet or press play and listen, 
To wrap it up. I have a gift. Made the ribbon 
With the same thread: I'm spinnin round their heads as I'm spittin 
The brake's broken I'm frickin playin Chicken with fame's admittance 
Hope to maybe make changes of opinion when I hit it. 
Like who's this kid, This Chipman 
Thought. I knew rap till he proved that I didn't 
Mad intuition. I have an imposition, 
To kill. Those who's skill is insufficient with swag 
Fillin. It'S position. That isn't a musician 
That's, a kid that talks. Fast. Stupidity with fruition, 
They lack intuition. They have a shitty disposition 
Like. This is about havin cash and tappin bitches 
 
No. You disagree 
Are. You shittin me 
Hip-Hop's the new definition of bigotry 
No. You disagree, 
Are, you shittin me 
Stop, being an idiot where's. The fuckin chivalry, 
 
Not in Wayne's, raps I'll. Tell you that 
Exact same crap. Every track, somehow it sells fast, 
It's, sad cause. The knowledge we'd have is held back 
By this Hell. We call Hip-Hop. It's not 
All bad, but when you toss swag 
And a hashtag in it, then its lost that 
That electrifyin feelin that I can touch the ceilin 
The light em up type of stuff who's, fuckin dealin, 
The mic must be stolen.. Those kids don't deserve to hold it. 
Won'T write with devotion, ghost writers, do it for em 
Besides. If they've been behind the Words they've spoken,
