For once Lyrics
by Xilent.

Why can't you see me trying?
Why why why?
Please notice me just for once.

Why can't you see me trying?
Why why why?
Please notice me just for once.

Please notice me just for once.
Why can't you see me trying?
Why why why?
Please notice me just for once.

There is something that you know.
Tell me something I should know.
There is something that you know.
Tell me something I should know.
For once.

You're listening to AudioPorn Records.
For Once... For Once.
Tell me something I should know.

Why can't you see me trying?
Why why why?
Please notice me just for once.

Why can't you see me trying?
Why why why?
Please notice me just for once.
