Whatever Lyrics

Fiend 
Ahh I'm just doing what the drug dealers do: 
Makin money and smokin weed with my thug nigga crew, 
C'Mon, I'm just doing what the drug dealers do. 
Makin money and smokin weed. With my thug nigga crew, 
Ya heard me: 
 
Mr., Serv-On 
I got pimps, lined up saying the love. My game 
I got bitches screaming out the gate. Hey baby, my name 
I can't bust for nothing. I can't fight with no ho 
I got 10,000 project. Niggas rushin. My show 
Pushin side to side if they feel what I say 
If. You scared of real niggas, get the fuck out the way. 
Never lovin no bitch, I won't live cause. I'M rich 
3rd ward. I represent yea, I'm bleedin for this 
I wear my tank with pride. Ain'T, no peace in my eyes, 
Say the wrong thang promise. Silly bitch you gon' die 
Never fuck, with troubles couldn't run from cowards. 
Tre 6 ya heard ... .... .The world is ours: 
 
, Fiend,
