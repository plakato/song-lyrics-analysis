Track 1 R Lyrics
by '68.

Take your heart into the next room.
Make a scene but make sure they ain't there for you.
You collected their hearts, you collected it all and.
Now you know that it will never be enough.
You've got to run.

Disappointed in the places that you'll never  go.
Cut quick but make sure it bleeds out slow.
You've created this world to give your heart a beat.
You've got nothing to prove but you're going to prove it anyway.

My hands are almost clean.
I've told you everything.
My closet's got nothing but that does not mean the dead can't be seen.
It means I've written it down.
My guts are on the floor and I have shoved it though the wires....
I've written it all before.
Pieces of you and pieces of me can come together.
Beautiful.
Let us talk.

Settle down, we're gonna die, it's alright.
