An Animal in Your Care Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Time after time.
You will forgive me.
Like an animal in your care.
But give it time.
You will outlive me.
And take the bow back you put in my hair.

Made a parade of myself in the street outside your house.
For the New York photographer there.
I fell for crime and I fell for beauty.
I fell for you because you're the one that cared.

And when I die.
You can put on costumes.
In the style of the clothes I wore.
And sing the songs your mother taught you.
When you were too young to know that this was what they were for.

La la la la. La la la la. lalala x2.

Like some dead relative.
You will remember me most by my funeral.
And all the beautiful toasts you made.
Take back the spade.
We've both been filling up our days like we were filling in a grave.

You let me hang, hang, hang around.
You put your ribbons in my hair.
It's in this language that I found.
I am an animal in your care.

An animal in your care.
An animal in your care.
An animal in your care.

It's in this language that I've found.
I am an animal in your care.
