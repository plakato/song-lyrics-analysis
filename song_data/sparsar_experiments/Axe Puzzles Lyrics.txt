Axe Puzzles Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Quasimoto.
Quasimoto, the green in your area.
Putting it on you sick with it, like malaria.
We rollin' like Spy vs. Spy, on dust.
Leaving grenades on your brain, cause we flying high.
Lord Quas run the Voodoo down, I do the Pharaoh's Dance.
Plus drink the Bitches Brew, living with the Spanish Key.
I'll meet you in the Sanctuary,.
I'm taking out my shovel.
And throwing your body under some rubble.
While I'm looking at the day's eye.
Down the road I'm learing lessons.
Stepping in the bone fire.
Down in my basement I got wack M.C.'s wearing buzzers.
Waiting for the axe puzzles.

Quasimoto! We coming though like earth rot.
We jump into your screen like blood clots.
Taking over your crews and what nots.
Wannabe M.C.'s rushing lines like venereal diseases.
Unseen collab Madlib beat thesis.
Lord Quas and the new breed, still dropping underground releases.
Secrets, I got mystical, magical.
It could be tragic for all you M.C.'s caught in my cylinder.
I disappear invisible to the sight.
Elemental always have us on flight.
Like a time bomb, get the jewels and the green.
Madlib, Lord Quas, Mr. Buddha, Skeeta.
We form the dream team, prepare for The Unseen.
Dropping Axe Puzzles.
