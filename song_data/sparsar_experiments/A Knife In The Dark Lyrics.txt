A Knife In The Dark Lyrics
by Volcanoes.

Lock your car doors cause this city's so messed up.
Bar your windows, don't go out after dark.
Don't look anybody in the eye because they'll kill you.
Oh! oh! they'll kill you, kill you.

Oh my god!
Check out that dude is that a do-rag? Oh! it's a do-rag!
Whip out your mace, cling to it for dear life because he's coming.
Oh! oh! he's coming, coming.
