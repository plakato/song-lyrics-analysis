In Dreams We Believe Lyrics
by Sydney.

The wrong direction I'm misplaced, where no one knows my name.
I'll walk straight in circles, searching for the perfect exit.
Don't lead me back down the second wrong turn in my life.
Cause I've seen it all before, and I can't let it happen again, she said.

If I was trailing would you wait for me?
I would stop with all the letters and have the decency.
To arrive with something better yeah, i know it hurts.
But can you think of any better since the time we lost our ways?
And if you stop to think then you would know how much i really loved you.
But now all i want is to cut you out of pictures of me and you, of you and me.
And all the times we called good memories.

You and I, you and I.
I'll write in cursive, you don't even know my name but.

But inside your head, the idea escapes you.
Where everything is so surreal right now.
You're the one i used to always run to.
Now the one I'd rather see sit on their own.

And I can't be here forever holding your hand like I used to.
Like I used to.

And I'm so sorry that you can't take anything, what you get from me x2.

It's all i have to give to you, to you.
Cause if we make it through this night, I just pray you feel this pain.
And if we make it through alright, I hope we never speak again.
And if we make it through this night, I just pray you feel this pain.

Save me once more leave me dying.
Hate me once more leave me lying.
