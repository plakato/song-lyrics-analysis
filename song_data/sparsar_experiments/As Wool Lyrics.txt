As Wool Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

And it came to pass....
And in the mean while.
In the heaven black.
Go again...back 7 times.
Behold the stone with 7 eyes.
A little cloud rises from the sea.
The multitude arose and led him unto thee.
Unto you an able bodied seaman.
The olive...the king of trees.
Ahab got up on his horse an rode.
But the hand was on the man.
Elijah the Lord is God.
Girded up his belt and ran.
There surely is...for silver a source.
A place for the all a gold that they refine.
Iron is taken from the dust.
And from the firm stone brass.
An end hath he set to darkness.
And to all perfection he does search.
Search a stone of darkness.
A stone of death-shade.
Ahab got up his horse rode.
But the Word was on the man.
Elijah the Lord is God.
Girded up his belt and ran.
Ran ahead and before the horse.
To where the Lord has sewn of course.
Best dressed whiter than snow.
The hair of His head.
Whiter than wool.
His throne it is aflame with fire.
And all its wheels ablaze.
The covenant you made with death.
It will be annulled.
Your agreement your treaty with the grave.
It will not stand.
The overwhelming scourge.
Shall pass right through.
And ye shall be trodden down.
Trodden down to the ground.
Ahab got up his horse rode.
But the hand was on the man.
Elijah the Lord is God.
Girded up his belt and ran.
Ran ahead and before the horse.
To where the Lord has sewn of course.
Elijah hear your name...the Lord is God.
Best dressed whiter than snow.
The hair of His head.
Whiter than wool.
His throne it was aflame with fire.
And all its wheels.
And all its wheels ablaze.
A river of flowing fire.
Coming out from before Him.
Pa win ta ya akicita.
