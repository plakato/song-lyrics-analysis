Let it Breathe Lyrics
by 6th Sense.

Cosmic dust.
Uh, uh.
Uh huh, yeah.
Uh huh, yeah.
Uh, check it.

I sent it back to you, after you sent it to me.
Cuz nuttin' in this world's more expensive than free.
And everything I am, is the best I could be.
You must be mistaken, unintentionally.
See, we be sunnin' when we run up in the room.
Filet so smooth, you can cut it with a spoon.
These mignon's been on another numbered groove.
6th just got it back, and I'm runnin on the move.
Ain't nothin I can do but show you sunttin' I can prove.
I'm stumped on the clues, cuz I'm drunk up off the booze.
I'm clued, bring the funk up off the blues.
And sprinkle it with jazz, more pizazz when amongst these other dudes.
Who's, that, where we are.
I'm up in the crib, rubbin up on some quinoa.
You see my de-mean-or.
More up and down than see-saws.
Old ???, in the lines I put 3 on.
My line back is 1 more, so my gun is a 3/4.
I see ya'll, hold on-let it breathe yall.

You sent it back to me, soon as I sent it to you.
Subpar artists, I could mention a few.
Even if I vent it ain't the best I presume.
Just stop, I'll show you what prevention could do.
Just to get ice, spent all of they bread-.
They'll be nothin round my neck worth more than my head.
And cuz I said head, these fags'll try to pause me.
Where ya head at?
Right you lost me.
I dont condone it if your homophobic.
Cuz to me it just seems more likely that 'chu homo, don't it?-.
Ha.
A new lease on my life, I'mma try to own it.
I wouldn't try to phone it.
I been carvin out the beats, so pardon on the speech-.
I ain't the hardest on the streets, but I'm the artist of the week.
Sweet.
This-shit was all good just a week ago-.
I ain't 'gon let the speakers blow, I'mma just let it breathe yall.
