Grand Theft Auto Lyrics
by Swych.


Every day it's like GTA.
Bodies on the ground and the sirens going around.
Everybody strapped up, every city, every town.
Every corner, bodies dropping, everybody know the sound.
Cops killing, no indictments, they don't even go to trial.
800,000 kids a year lost and never found.
Probably in the White House together running all around.
Find Saddam Hussein but can't find somebodies child, I mean.
You got Bin Laden, tell me where these kids hiding.
All these wire taps, you can't bring a child back.
Can't see why they gave us hope we can't reach.
Can't breathe, well you see where Eric Garner's at.
Mike Brown, Trayvon, no surviving that.
Where's the riots, I'll be posted where the fire at.
As a country, can't tell you where we're headed.
Even cop callers stop and got to think of 9/11, wait.
People either stealing cars, or they stealing bars.
Not too many go to school, or they get a job.
If he ain't shooting 3's probably shooting for the stars.
Or shooting people on the corners and the boulevards.
They let Obama run the country but they had to do it.
Puppet master pulling strings while he's interviewing.
On top of that I got to look at what my cities doing.
Knowing that I played a part in why my cities ruined.

People drowning in a sea of police arms.

Avoid the jungle in the streets because they mean harm.

The storyline today could always be your last.

And if you die in this game boy ain't no coming back.

Everyday, more and more, life is looking like a game of GTA.
So watch how you play it.

Let me know when you finna bang for something other than the side of the city.
that a nigga from though.
Let a nigga know when you gon' get a purpose paired with the .44.
Maybe when you got a shotgun you call Malcolm, when you got a handgun you call.
Huey.
Assata's name on your AK, Bobby Seale for that uzi.
You just rolling around with that toolie, ready to bust on injustice.
Not talking no cop unless they crooked.
How about the pushers for needle pushers.

She another ghost in this ghost town and that's real.

Everytime I see P-A, it's almost like I'm in a game of GTA.
Brothers want to come up on some money in a easy way.
Wind up living on the run for at least three days.
Better watch your back, with the cops on the hunt don't be thinking that your.
town can't be Ferguson.
Phoenix P.D. told Rumain keep his hands up then to keep his hands down and.
they murdered him.
See this ain't no game though it seems like that.
It is what it is man it be's like that.
Kiss your loved ones because these kids got guns.
And your last words could be I'm a be right back.
How many got to die for some respect, huh?
If could even be me next.
Until then I'm still praying for a reset, yeah.

Hold up.
Cold cold world? Cold cold world.
I could use a cup of hot cocoa girl.
Ha, corny but the world need laughter.
City that I'm from, they be running out of caskets.
And cemetary space, remembering.
elementary.
Thinking that this life was nothing but fun and games.
Now they 8 years old, running with guns and blades.
They ratchet, no clank, they ratchets go bang!
like it's GTA.

You a man one day, t-shirt the next, damn.
Now I just hope that t-shirt look fresh.
I got a right to live, but I'm obligated to death.
So my heart on my sleeve like a tattoo.
Cliche, taboo, now everybody rocking vests.
God bless you, bullets coming at you.
Wish you the best, whether you ride for the South or the West.
I'm a, rider.
New Bed Stuy-er, I ain't gon' tell you what sider.
I'm a, rider.
New Bed Stuy-er, it don't even matter what sider, uh.
But if you lose your homies, rob who you want you'll never have it all.

So many people dying in my city got me searching for the Dragonballs.
Eww!

*static*.
