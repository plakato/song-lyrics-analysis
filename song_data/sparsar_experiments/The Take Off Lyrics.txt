The Take Off Lyrics
by WreQ one.


Damn you got soul &amp; you keep it real.
..You should know how I feel.

Damn, she lookin' right &amp; lookin' like the right one.
Came with one rolled, &amp; told me, We should light one.
She came in tights, she wanna spend the night; one stand with me girl.
&amp; I can get'cha right. You know, that I know, I know what you like.
..&amp; for the night, you were just my type.
About to do the wrong thing &amp; make it look right.
I'm a Queens kid, She's from Brooklyn like Spike, Lee.
She wanna to fall in love, I told her the chance is un-like-ly.
Its not like me, I'm more used to lust.
I told her don't wait for me, cause I keep it moving like a bus.
Never met a woman that I trust, &amp; sorry, but trust is just a must.
Why else are we together? You thinkin', I think, I could be with someone.
better.
Never, I know you remember the letter, I sent you last November.
When you were getting older &amp; colder than the weather.
Head over heels, you wore Prada patent leather.
&amp; I was with whatever, you wanted to be mine, forever;.
But I couldn't do the time.
&amp;You hung up, cause I was caught up in the rhyme.
Busy tryin' to climb this ladder called life.
&amp; I don't need a wife.
All I need is a mic, a light, &amp; some time to write.
I'm a little lost, I hope I find my way.
Whatever that take, cause that may take all day.
I'm waiting on my break like a waiter with a tray.
&amp; you could say that, that line, is cliche;.
But I don't get caught up in the he or she say.
All I know is this, like the beats on replay.
&amp; go ahead, you can play it back now.
I came from rags to riches, so they gotta' ask how.
This is my time to shine, you think I'm gonna slack now?
Not a chance; I want to spend my summers out in France.
&amp; tell them record labels,.. that it's time for my advance. goddamn.
