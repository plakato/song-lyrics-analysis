Cash Money Lyrics
by Tyga.


Aye.. Who that in the Lambo?
That's the Last King boy, haan?
Last King Records takin' over for the 2016 ‘till forever.

I got bitches in my swimming pool.
Real life mermaids.
Models in my living room.
Lined by Hermes.
Yeah nigga…
Somebody must have heard me when I prayed.
Cause I'm paid cash money.
Uh, Cash Money never paid me.
But your boy did his thing.
Still make cash money.
Yeah it's mine I can throw it in the air if I wanna.

Rolex, mo' sex.
T-Raww, gon' flex.
Bad bitches.
Ass, chest.
Rich niggas, no stress.
Smoke when I wanna.
Ball when I wanna.
Fuck who I wanna.
Everything a hundred.
My cars diamond diamond.
Still minks in the summer.
Ice in my grill.
Tattoos on my stomach.
Yeah, she break it down.
Break break it down.
I'm in the court.
Talkin' chat, choppers style.
Yeah that choppers style.
Chit chat choppers style.
We lived a lot.
Nigga we on a loud.
Ugh private jet.
Bubble legs.
Super famous don't need no press.
Imma hot boy shout out Weezy baby.
If your man is low.
Nigga, you should pay em.

I got bitches in my swimming pool.
Real life mermaids.
Models in my living room.
Lined by Hermes.
Yeah nigga…
Somebody must have heard me when I prayed.
Cause I'm paid cash money.
Uh, Cash Money never paid me.
But your boy did his thing.
Still make cash money.
Yeah it's mine I can throw it in the air if I wanna.

Homie we talkin' a lot.
She be frontin' a lot.
Wanna pull up on the block.
Bitches rubbin' their twat.
I'm in the car with a vibe.
Yeah that car goes a lot.
Now she fuckin' a lot.
Yeah we fuckin' a lot.
Now she rubbin' my cock.
Yeah we hug in the block.
Put your face in my watch.
Yeah that's chrono watch.
All ice.
I got hella how's believe me.
Tell ‘em bitches pimpin' ain't easy.
I'm on top with the top down.
One knock with the sugar and I'm sauced out.
I'm hot now.
Played with fire, I ain't never drown.
Ballin' out number 1.
With assist now.
Big hits, mo' rich.
New car, new bitch.
I'm a hot boy, free B.G.
Free to Carter V, let your streets eat.

I got bitches in my swimming pool.
Real life mermaids.
Models in my living room.
Lined by Hermes.
Yeah nigga…
Somebody must have heard me when I prayed.
Cause I'm paid cash money.
Uh, Cash Money never paid me.
But your boy did his thing.
Still make cash money.
Yeah it's mine I can throw it in the air if I wanna.
