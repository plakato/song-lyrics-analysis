Could I Be Lyrics
by Wood.

I know that I could never be.
The first one to kiss you.
Cause darling there's been many men.
Before me.
I guess that I could never be.
The first one to love you.
Cause all of those days.
Have been gone.
In every city street and every night and day.
It's a world war trying to get your own way.
If I had a wish.
I swear you'd hear me say.
Could I be the last give in.
Say you'll never start again.
Could I be the dream, the dream for you.
Could I be? Would I do?
Could I be the last surrender.
Could I be the number one contender.
Could I trust you if you don't come home.
Could I leave you all alone?
Tougher than the rest of us.
You're making out like it never was.
You say you got the whole thing.
For truth.
You'd rather walk away than fight.
And you'd rather do what's wrong than right.
It brings yourself in the darkest shade.
Of gray.
In every city street and every night and day.
It's a world war trying to get your own way.
If I had a wish.
I swear you'd hear me say.
Could I be the last give in.
Say you'll never start again.
Could I be the dream, the dream for you.
Could I be? Would I do?
Could I be the last surrender.
Could I be the number one contender.
Could I trust you if you don't come home.
Could I leave you all alone?
Every city street and every night and day.
It's a world war trying to get your own way.
If I had a wish.
I swear you'd hear me say.
Yeah, could I be the last give in.
Say you'll never start again.
Could I be the dream for you?
Could I be the last surrender.
Could I be the number one contender.
Could I trust you if you don't come home.
Could I leave you all alone?
