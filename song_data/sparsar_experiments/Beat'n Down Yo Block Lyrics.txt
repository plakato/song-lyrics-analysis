Beat'n Down Yo Block Lyrics
by UNK.


Yeah~!
One time dis ya boy DJ Montay right.
We doin this shit for all my motherfuckin hood niggas.
All my niggas that beat'n down they block.
Big Oomp Records, DJ Unk.
Tell them niggas how you ride nigga.

Unk.
I'm poppin my collar, I'm grippin that wood.
My kush in my hand, my trunk beatin good.
If it's knockin they jockin, feel that bass that's a hobby.
Beat through yo' hood them kickers kick off in yo' ass like karate.
They hear that bass wanna try me, honk at Greenbriar Mall.
I pop my trunk and all them hoes did the Westside walk.
I'm with Montay in the South, system soundin so mean.
26's make it stretch, sittin high like Yao Ming.
Big Oomp down for my time, trunk thumpin somethin crucial.
Bumpin B.I.G. and T.I.P., hit up Club Crucial.
On my waist is a Ruger, love my bass and my amps.
Adjust ya tweeters make it sweeter, chain bright as a lamp.
They feel me.

I'm beatin down ya block and you can hear when I'm comin {*4X*}.
Can you feel me?  I know they feel me now.
Can you feel me?  I know they feel me now.
Can you feel me?  I know they feel me now.
But can you feel me?  I know they feel me now.

Unk.
Yeah they bumpin the Camp, candy paint lookin good.
And I know that they can feel me half a block from the hood.
From the block hear you good, yo' trunk don't sound so clear.
I bump like D-Lo tell me lil' nigga do you hear what I hear?
Speakers front to the rear, it's DJ Unk in yo' ear.
And free walk chain let it bang, for what shorty we here.
See how my name just appear, on CD players and screens.
DJ Jelly DVD's jump from scene to scene.
Fo'-fifteen hittin mean, tote the scope and the beam.
Turn it up a notch, bouncin off the roof I'm clean.
Steady stackin my green, money high as a star.
And the best part about it is the bass in my car.

Unk.
From the amplifiers  can't bust 'em.
Cause my speakers built from West Coast Customs.
Customized sound, trunk shakin the whole block.
TV screens in the dash, champ playin the X-Box.
Yup I'm beatin down ya block, fo'-fo'-deuce sittin tall.
Bend my hat back, knockin down pictures off your wall.
A-T-L comin hard, beatin hard in a droptop.
Old school Chevy's, color candy, call it lollipop.
Cutlass with the T top, Buick with the brains out.
SS Impalas and Cadillacs stay pimped out.
Smoke 'dro then peal out, smash the gas I'm on my way.
Beatin down your block, fuck nigga, get up out my way.

Nigga Oomp Camp all up in yo' ear nigga.
DJ Montay, DJ Unk, that's how that shit gon' always ride out nigga.
Keep your motherfucker speakers fixed nigga cause we gon' bump forever nigga.
Oomp Camp signin out, Big Oomp bitch.
