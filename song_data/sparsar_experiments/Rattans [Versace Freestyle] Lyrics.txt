Rattans [Versace Freestyle] Lyrics
by Yung Rudd.


Yeah, run it dey.
boy.
Ahhh.
Yo.

Versace, Versace.
I cannot afford but I will, do you copy....
Like cheating on tests? I'mma just kill this rap shit dude, you watch me.
Haters just hope that I'm not rolling Benz while you still in jalopies.

Cause then your girlfriends will be all on my balls, like boxers or jockies.

Trini.
The country that I rep.
Trini.
Love it 'til my death.
Trini.
The girl I'm loving is.
Trini.

But not by birth by parentage.
Least she fucks with her heritage.
Double entendre.
Just kill beats right through - my mantra.
Lyrically shoot shit up like Contra.
Smoking on poop? I'll sponsor.
Shit to make you say, Whoo! Dai ganja!
Smoke like rastas.
Never do coke nor speed like Sandra....
Bullock. You're.
full of shit.
Hating? Then you are a buller, it's.
Not meant in the homophobic way.
Just means you're a bitch when I call you gay.

Fuck it though, only got time for the hot rhymes.
And sometimes the sublime bud I'mma roll up.
My shit is nice bitch, like my gyal and my rhymes is.
So sick that it might itch or make you want to throw up.
Small fries have to grow up.
Wedged in a life where you have to buy po' stuff.
Shonuff, you follow me? You'll blow up.
Like a doll for a virgin, so much cash you're gonna be splurging.
Haters pockets and feelings hurting, their heads gonna hang down like.
curtains.

Swag...Swag.
Took a pause for a cause.
Cooked in the middle of the song like a boss.
Woo! Swag!
Like Lil Boss.
Then a new flow, I flipped - coin toss.
Want to be rich forever like Ross.

Versace.
I buy my versace.
In Rattans.

Yo.
I just killed that shit, dan.
2 Much Vybz.
XE.
SRP yuh large.
1KB.
Yo.
