Thugg Love Lyrics
by 50/50 Twin.


Thug love 2003, all I want is a down woman.
And I'll treat you like a queen, I promise.
But first you gotta have God in your life.
For us to make it, peep this.

50/50 Twin.
You been on your cycle, almost a week.
Jump in the shower, dry off let's freak.
Ride this piece, like you riding a Lexus jeep.
I study your body, come on teacher test me.
Riding it slow, while you moaning low.
The sound of your voice, make my piece go long.
Thug love, is all I can give.
Hop in the drop, watch One Life to Live.
Broke or not, you ride by my side.
Taking pride, in 50/50 Twin ride.
You no gold digger, you just glad I'm shining.
I'm not a trick, but you deserve a diamond.
Come off the block, stretched out toe time.
My potatoes smashed, and my chicken is fried.
I appreciate, the affection you show.
Your smile is pretty, your personality glow.

Mista Madd - 2x.
Tell me what you think, about a thug like me.
If you're a real woman, then I'll treat you like a queen.
You're even independent, with your own money.
But if you're non-dependent, you'll get none from me.

50/50 Twin.
You can have my heart, but I'm cold hearted.
Blame it on, the last broad I departed.
This song, is for all real women.
A mama and two sisters, I feel women.
I know what a woman want, like Mel Gibson.
Forget the make-up, go on wear your clear skin.
Lay on the bed, as I massage your leg.
Return the favor, cause you gave me some head.
You not a freak, you just love you some of me.
Let's take a trip skinny dip, on Palm Beach.
Keep you in my vecinity, arm reach.
You know one thang I can't stand, a crumb leach.
If loving you is wrong, then I'm right.
The one I like, I love when the time right.
Won't hold you down, like a string flying kites.
Or keep you in the house, cause I know you down tight.

50/50 Twin.
Other women, want to be in your shoes.
They weren't willing, to pay those dues.
The best relationships, start as friends.
Ain't no I love you, soon as it begins.
Strings attached, if it's meant it'll be.
After we married, will it last we'll see.
I will refrain, from domestic violence.
That means no black rings, around your eyelids.
Sorry to you baby mama, by the way.
All the times I hit you, still you stayed.
We even tried, to pray and pray.
We worshipped eachother, God looked the other way.
I ain't trying, to pull no Ja Rule.
I'm just a wise man, use to be fool.
This is for all my down women, I'm out.
Fat ugly or skinny, dime piece or not.

Mista Madd.
I'm just a thug baby.
Need some loving lady.
I'm just a thug baby.
Need a lil' loving baby.
A woman like you.
A thug like me.
