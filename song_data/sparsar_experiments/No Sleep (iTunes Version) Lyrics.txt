No Sleep (iTunes Version) Lyrics
by Sway UK.


I went to the mountains 
Fell in love with the peace 
But, no matter how hard I try, 
I just can't get no sleep. 
 
Yeah yeah Sway has arrived 
Keeping you up through the day and the night 
Some wan na be ballers. Some wan na be G's. 
Saturday night fever we're staying alive 
It's the day in the life roaming, the streets 
Hands in the air. If you know you're a 
Let them phone, the police, we never hide 
Divisions, but we never came here to fight 
Better press to top 5. There ain't! No ain't! No challenge 
 
We, practise and train in a place where there ain't, no cameras, 
 
You, better get ready like a sub when the bass goes, bang 
, 
We, climb up tables and we don't even take no ladders. They'Ll be looking like
where's. Your table manners 
Let's, go 
, 
I went to the mountains 
Fell in love with the peace 
But. No matter how hard I try, 
I just can't get no sleep. 
I said I just can't get no sleep. 
I said I just can't get no sleep. 
I said I just can't get no 
Just can't get. No 
Just can't get no sleep, 
 
K-S-I! Yes, I'm an all
nighters. I don't like rest 
Nothing on me at my best. 
Selena Gomez. You'Ve got nice 
24/7. I aim for the heavens. Even when I was eleven 
Heaven was finding the seven minutes alone in my bedroom, 
AAAAARRRGGGHHH 
Hear that sound heartbeat, beating 
Going so fast. You can see that I'm Beasting 
No sleep, no sleep, no sleep 
You won't see any cause. I ate my sheep 
Let's get messy like Lionel 
Get hyper as a mosh. This pit 
I'm on this B @ *^ % 
No one - can stop me 
Out of my way. Let me finish this properly 
 
Deep breath here goes: it's super Swah 
On top of the mountain. No, it never gets lonely when you're going for the cup 
And getting them round in with the whole team, no stopping until we're holding
a trophy 
, 
Alright Tubes. You show me, but you got one bar and one bar only 
Sum those up on the way to the top 
 
I said I just can't get no sleep. 
I said I just can't get no sleep. 
I said I just can't get no 
Just can't get no 
Just can't get no sleep.
