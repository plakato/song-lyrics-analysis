Any Other Way Lyrics
by The Zombies.

Blunstone.

Still remember seeing you standing there.
Alone in a crowded room.
Suddenly your presence filled the air.
Nothing that I could do.
Always knew you were the only one.
I never told you so.
Thought you'd understand what I had done.
When I had to let you go.
Thought that we could prove ourselves.
Show that we were strong.
Should have written every day.
Now I know that I was wrong.

If there was any other way.
Don't you think I would have found it by now.
Found a way round it somehow.
If there was any other way.

Left you on a rainy summer's day.
I thought you understood.
You turned and never looked around again.
I knew you never would.
We were only children then.
Living on borrowed time.
Stars were shining in your eyes.
Tears were filling up in mine.

If there was any other way.
Don't you think I would have found it by now.
Found a way round it somehow.
If there was any other way.
And if the world should end today.
I'd take my last breath whispering your name.
Wondering if you'd ever felt the same.
If there was any other way.
