Live in My Head Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

I can't say your name, I can't play the game.
I can't mess around and end up down again.
Cause you gave me the perfect surprise.
And it's hard to let go of the look in your eyes.

I can't fake or hide I can't believe the lies.
The past I can't face when your on my case again.
And I wanted to show so much more.
But I know it will fall if we open the door.

All the things that you said still live in my head.
All the places that we went we're gonna go again.
Now all that remains is the love in my vein, you still live in my head.

Control is not my direction or design.
Here with my confession and I'm not messing.
I've been waiting for you all the time.
Don't you know what I'm feeling inside?

All the things that you said still live in my head.
All the places that we went we're gonna go again.
Now all that remains is the love in my vein, you still live in my head.
Now all that remains is the love in my vein, you still live in my head.

Cause you gave me the perfect surprise.
And it's hard to let go of the look in your eyes.

All the things that you said still live in my head.
All the places that we went we're gonna go again.
Now all that remains is the love in my vein, you still live in my head.
