Earth Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


The moon won't glow here.
The wind won't blow here.
I don't wanna be here.
The sun won't shine here.
The earth won't twine here.
The rain won't fall here.
I don't wanna be here.
I can't leave here.
The clouds won't come here.
The snow doesn't fall here.
The ice doesn't freeze here.
The moon won't show here.
The water doesn't flow here.
The sun won't glow here.
I don't wanna be here.
I don't wanna be here.
But I can't leave here.

Sitting in a dark room.
Wondering where you are.
Longing for your touch.
I hope I see you soon.
Even if you're gone for a minute, you know I still feel it, that feeling that.
I miss you.
And every time that you cry, I just wanna die.
I can't believe that I hurt you.
I don't like who I see.
When I look into the mirror, when I look into the mirror.
I don't like just who I see, I know just what I feel...
