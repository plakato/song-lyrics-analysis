Baby girl, 
Oh, baby 
Alright, alright 
 
Two drinks turned to exchanging numbers 
And, we fell in love and that was it 
Had a nigga caught up in your love, 
Even left them hoes alone. So I could be your man. 
I gave up everything. Don'T think you knew it 
I even put a ring on it after one year 
Cause, I thought I had to prove it 
Then we fought and we fussed and we cussed 
'Til. You were back in my arms 
Don't really know when we lost our trust. 
I guess it faded over time 
Didn't get to learn how to be friends. 
Our love was doomed from the beginning, 
We're both afraid it's the end 
And. Maybe we just got ta. Let it go 
, 
Breakdown, 
Let it go 
Girl before it drives us crazy 
Let. It go, let it go. 
I know it's so hard to. Let it go 
Let it go. Let it go 
Girl before this shit starts to drive us 
You gon' always be my 
We. Just got ta, let it go, let it go. 
The sun will come up in the morning when we 
Let it go. Let it go. 
Facebook and Twitter ain't gon' understand us. 
Let it go. Let it go. 
 Got ta, do it right now before it drives us, so 
You are my baby forever. My baby
