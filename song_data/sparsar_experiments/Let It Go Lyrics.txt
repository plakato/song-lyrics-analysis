Let It Go Lyrics

Baby girl.
Oh baby.
Alright, alright.

Two drinks turned to exchanging numbers.
And we fell in love and that was it.
Had a nigga caught up in your love.
Even left them hoes alone, so I could be your man.
I gave up everything, don't think you knew it.
I even put a ring on it after one year.
Cause I thought I had to prove it.
Then we fought and we fussed and we cussed.
'Til you were back in my arms.
Don't really know when we lost our trust.
I guess it faded over time.
Didn't get to learn how to be friends.
Our love was doomed from the beginning.
We're both afraid it's the end.
And maybe we just gotta let it go.

Breakdown.
Let it go.
Girl before it drives us crazy.
Let it go, let it go.
I know it's so hard to let it go.
Let it go, let it go.
Girl before this shit starts to drive us.
You gon' always be my.
We just gotta let it go, let it go.
The sun will come up in the morning when we.
Let it go, let it go.
Facebook and Twitter ain't gon' understand us.
Let it go, let it go.
Gotta do it right now before it drives us so.
You are my baby, forever my baby.
