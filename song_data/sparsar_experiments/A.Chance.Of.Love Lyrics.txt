A.Chance.Of.Love Lyrics
by WreQ one.

Its about the love.

I said to know me is to love me;.
Gotta love the kid.
Cause the flow is so lovely.
All I know is love.
Cause hate is so ugly.
They busy getting high.
&amp; still can't stay above me.
Without a beat, they won't hear what I speak.
I'm getting slept on, &amp; I.
don't even get to sleep.
Queens Dreamers,.
We gonna reach prime peak.
&amp; you ain't gotta judge me.
I'm only judged by the company I keep.
&amp; I keep a small circle cause trust ain't cheap.
My secrets with my enemies six feet deep.
You know I been around y'all.
Prayin on my down fall.
Hoping my hits never take off.
Like a ground ball.
Little do they know I'm on the runway.
Plane taking off.
&amp; I only booked the ticket only one way.
Man, I'm Just a kid from Queens.
Trying to live out my Dreams.
&amp; I know that I'mma make it one day.

I'm pledging my heart on you once again.
Just to be your man!
Give us some kind of chance Cause I love you, Baby.

I said to know me is to love me.
She love bubble baths while sipping on bubbly.
I know what she like, &amp; Im'a treat her right.
Scenes out of a movie, but this is my life.
Lights, Camera, Action.
Cell phones snappin', pictures of a rapper with a classic fashion.
Style from the '90s, I love.
the past with a passion.
But now I'm in the present, looking back and laughin'.
&amp; Now I'm making classics.
My old shit, is still better than your past hits.
Man, This shit is for your ears, this shit is for my peers.
They all tell me speak up, cause the truth is hard to hear.

&amp; this my year, Man, I tell'em all like this my year.
