All Day (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

Blacker than half.
You will never win.
So outta my mind.
Abra cadabra.
Better get ya best burnin.
1.
Anything ya really need in life.
Like a mufuckin polygraph.

Po light of mine.
I get up in a mosh pit.
Witchamacallit when I stick a flip.
Bringing back the track at the end.
To the next thing.
Now it's all black hoodies.
You shit stain.
Day to day.
So I can dip in the stash spot.
3 and to the 4.
Aim away.
Real bad mood.
Have him posted on the corner.
Until ya break a fuckin bone.
Ain't reflected by the plays I'm gettin.
Ass up with the kids out.
Woah bitch it's prime time.
And send the body back to mommy.
Past me.
Welcome to the game.
Ah.
Back to the magic.
But the crack too Whitney.
Tell em what it is.
Of illegitimates.
Ain't no way you gettin.
I pick in a pad lock.
Thizzed out.
Insta gram.
Back up in this bitch.
I peel that crew.
To let ya bitch twerk.
Why ya try to fight me.
Bang a rang.
OxyContin.
Half mast it can be.
We ready for lift off.
The sound of me rappin will make her wetter then where the Fish lurk.
It's evident.
With the Mac too pretty.
I'm a villain here to pillage a village.
Blast that harassing.
TMNT footies.
You can call me insane.
Already movin on.
Faggots can't catch me.
I don't want it up on Instagram.
Gon' let it shine.
Lyrics that I'm spitting.
New jack city.

In ya gullet.
Start shakin that ass.
Speed dial.
Y'all really wanna see a Mufucka.
And I try to get the bobby.
UPS the body bag.

So when I bust a fuckin flow.
Then pick ya pockets for wallet.
And you be in the back watching.
All the bitches on the floor.
Well now ya got it fam.
Just watch me jot lines.
Rap massive ante.
Don't forget to get.
Actually I'm in a.

In a minute get them in it.
I'm hitting.

As a matter of fact I never left.

I steel clap dudes.
Consider me a literary immigrant.
You already fuckin know.
Get the fuckin party poppin.
And Evelyn.
Keep ya guessang.
In the membrane.
Ya never sent message is quite irrelevant.
I mean come and get a peak of this.
Everybody in the building.
Teenage mutant ninja turtle.
Off a chem strain.
Ya missin.
Where the cash hot mad props.

Admit it.
Me chillin in ya melon.
Will catch you.
2.
Face down bitch.
Pulling out my flip phone.
I'm on fire.
No matter where ya wanna run I.
We the dudes that hit a spliff and shitll leave ya chest hurtin.
Poppin oxy at the party.
Of the averages rappin.
Put away ya flip phone.
Fastly.
And I'm mad and attacking.
You ain't lucky if you got mine.
With a little bit of.
Somethin in the gift shop.
All reded like a stop sign.
Black satin panties.
Nobody flow go so dope as.
And meal crack new.
Little bit of feelin comin in I bet I won't lie.
Ever since a kiddie in the.
