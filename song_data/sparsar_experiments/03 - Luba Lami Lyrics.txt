03 - Luba Lami Lyrics
by PureMatics.


Lets pour out
Some liquor for those
We, have lost

Luba lami. Mama wami
Wangondla ngo thando mama wami
Luba lami
Nkanyezi yami
Uthando lwakho
Mama wami
Lukwenza ubeyingilosi, yami

Ubaba, wasitshiya
Sengikhulile
Kodwa umuyi uNatasha
She was too young to die
I, don't know why
God acts in misterious ways, devious ways

As. I pen this line
Last night. We lost uAunty
Una Chengetai
Hamba kahle
MaNdazi Maphosakazi
Bako Ndazi, we've seen better days

Remember ubaba
When. He worked e-Bentwood
Way before the industry got political
Every morning. Iphoriji elibilisiweyo
He also needed a packed. Lunch
Isinkwa lekhabitshi

Those were the days
Way before I knew where babies came. From
Its all yesteryear, memories
What about u chago
Ulubilisiweyo

Ekuseni, lantambama, nsuku zonke
LesiNdebele sakhe
Esikokayi
Baba. Miss we baba
Wemiss: u Aleck, Ndogwa, Daba, Nleya
Lala ngokuthula
I, know u stillwatch over us
La okhona

Nkanyezi yami
Uli, luba, lami
Nkanyezi, yami
Nkanyezi, yami
Uli, luba lami
Nkanyezi yami

Baba times are changing
In Zimbabwe
Imbuzi sesa zidla zaphela
Funerals are getting expensive
Imbuzi sezikubo $ 70
Ama coffin, asedura

Kodwa baba abantu, bayabuya ngobunengi
Baba. Your funeral was epic baba
Even, though i missed it
Ntjenjema Ntogwa Daba and Aleck
Lingama luba ami

Luba
Muyi. Natasha
Uliluba lami
Nkanyezi yami
Why did death come for you 
At, so young an age

For years. I was filled with rage
Eventually. I accepted the past
But now at 38
I'mstill at Richard Morris
Crying myself, to sleep
Crying and dying at the back of the 43 stagecoach bus

On paper and on song

Tasha uliluba lami
Inkanyezi yami
When. I need light to shine my way
Victor and Norma
I wish? U were here to see your boy: shine
I fly the Ndazi flag with pride

Proper Ndambeli Ndazi Ndazi
Nomathamsanqa
I have learnt to shine
Ngiyambuluza
Kangi bambeki
Ngiyisitubhu sako fambeki

Nkanyezi yami
Uli luba lami
Nkanyezi yami
Nkanyezi yami
Uli luba lami
Nkanyezi yami
