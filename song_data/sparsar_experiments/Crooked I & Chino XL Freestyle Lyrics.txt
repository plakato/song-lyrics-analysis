Crooked I & Chino XL Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway.

Crooked, I 
I spit impossible rhymes 
Full of philosophical lines, 
My phenomenal shine, 
Leave every one of your opticals blind 
Run you over when it's apocalypse time: 
I'm half-man half-diesel like Optimums Prime 
Cockin', this nine to pop ya 
Permanent disfigurement. Have you rockin' 
Half a mask like the Phantom of the Opera 
Mach three is how fast I'll drop ya 
Walk back to five's the speed they clocked. The 
Hatchet affect deliberately chopped ya. 
You thought you had it win here: 
Like watchin', porno flicks, with six chicks, 
I'm. The hardest one in here 
Straps on the New Year 
We bust, like every night's New Years 
Cerebral hemisphere's, get blew here, 
It's really no need to cuss and fuss. 
Just 
Hop out of the bushes scratched up 
From the brush and bust 
I, make the angriest atheist. Praise me: if not 
He's feelin' the simultaneous pain of a shot 
And, I shake his pancreas 
Maybe. It'S my instantaneous plots. 
The craziest emcee couldn't face me. 
If an alien gave him this thoughts. 
Kamikaze'S regulate, 
I, strap a time bomb under my trench, coat 
And hug. You till it detonates 
I, was brainwashed by NWA and BDP 
I'm the year 2000 version of the DOC 
And. When Crooked I spot these fake cliques, 
They better, be able to dodge bullets like The Matrix or take six 
I'm so ominous in dominant in prominent hip-hop conglomerate. 
On this continent, I'm bombin' it 
When, Icon, ill out, 
I spit out rhymes, so offensive. Even Chino will tell me to chill-out 
 
Chino XL 
I, don't care what nobody spits 
Or, what they kick 
I punch them in the throat 
And watch them choke like the Knicks 
But. Why all these rappers want to rhyme. Like me, 
Your words should be like Jon B worships black ponani 
And. Push me to the point. 
I wan na smack'em yo 
To, try to steal my fans like Chico, did to D'Angelo's 
But. If imitation were an asset, 
There will be nothin' left of me, but jewelry. Fifty-Two, teeth 
And a belt buckle. 
My skills are to die for 
During writers block. I still create this timeless lines of wisdom. 
Like they pass the lips of Buddha 
Who, the sharp shooter, that's claimin' 
That they gon na kill me 
When. They see me 
Wouldn't, aim that remote at a hundred inch color TV 
I'm all for the heezy 
See, that your record company done hired 
Chino XL to come and repossess their deal back. 
I put the fly to your eye: 
Like Ethiopians, starvin', 
Life, tedious task, 
You! No longer have to take pardon 
You shouldn't, have start'em 
You done done it 
Go purchases, a microscope to read the list of rappers names that won it. 
My brain deserve its own infomercial 
For, the how it thinks 
You can't be safe by coppin' 
Tae-Bo with Billy Blanks 
I turn on sinks, 
I rock to rhythm of the water drops that run out 
Then I freestyle continuously 
Til the whole reservoir done run out 
And. I walk with gun out 
For cats that want to start something 
I shine like I control the sun's Off and On button 
Oh. What was that 
You got by hit by Chino electricity 
I'm black when it's convenient, like Mariah's ethnicity, 
Multiplicity, 
I'm, out hunting, my clones 
Rap's? Turning out more sweet, proteges, 
Than, Quincy Jones, 
My style, Pendergrass shoes 
Never touch the ground 
Mocked you so high 
You, don't remember it's a sound 
I'm Jim Brown. In his day, 
Toughest cat to tackle 
I'll leave your brain hanging out 
Like Chris Rock's adam's apple 
I'm. So rare 
Battling Chino XL's like Africa 
Yeah they talk about it 
But. They don't really want to go there. 
I'M corrupted 
Here. It comes 
You, better duck quick, 
Yeah, haha
