Before I Start to Cry Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

Before I start to cry.
Just turn and walk on by.
Go away, baby baby, leave today.
Don't make me think about.
What you should have figured out.
Is it true.
Was it always me and you.
So go away.
Don't stay.
Baby baby, listen to me when I say.
Just go on home.
And leave me all alone.
Just turn around and say goodbye.
Before I start to cry.
