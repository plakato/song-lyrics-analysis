Cash On Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


It go down straight up, it go down in here.
All night in the lab, bout 5 in the morning.
Me and my nigga Craig, you know I'm tal'n bout.
Ted Wheel in this motherfucker, that's how we do it.
Know I'm saying feel this, huh.

Noke D - 2X.
Candy coated, wet up out Eddy's.
So you know I'm, pulling out ready.
Grind stay stead on, gotta keep on getting my feddy.
Bitches bopping car hopping, ain't no stopping though.
I'm on the gas yo, I gotta get my cash on.

Dirty $.
Yeah, there ain't no stopping a G.
When he got his mind, focused on his currency.
It's that Dirty $, but you can call me Jerry McGuire.
We ain't swapping gay bout Deniro, fa sho I'm gon holla.
At you much later playa, now I'm grinding to get this paper.
Trying to reep the benefits, from seven years of hard labor.
When I speak please believe, my speech ain't cheap.
Spit for my health fuck that, I spit for the wealth.
My well-being, comes from seeing my baby girl happy.
My T looking sassy, in that new drop top Caddy.
My pappy out there barely, but that only prepare me.
Not to lean on no nigga, cause ain't no nigga can carry me.
Junior hustle to get it, whatever hustle I'm with it.
Make mine whatever custom fitted, in too deep to quit it.
Went from ashy to classy, stay far from flashy.
Got to make enough do', so the bread outlasts me.

Lil' Shay.
I'm candy coated out Eddy's, as I bounce rock steady.
Sitting low with Noke D, got a nigga looking ready.
We ain't tripping fa sho, in a candy Tahoe.
Tag team on a hoe, how the fucking game go.
Fa sho we looking good, in the hood gripping wood.
On some other shit, plus we dropping off the goods.
Here it is Shayzie baby, so don't front.
Candy red looking blooded, like the first of the month.
Pulling up iced up, chain glass on 4's.
For me and will be, to go and fuck with some hoes.
You know, I'm at the dackory bar.
With a bad ass bitch, giving head in the car.
Jump out brush off, cause it's money to make.
Plus I got another Houpe, for that end of the pay.
Young Shay, Chill Will and Noke holding the wheel.
Pulling out on triple see, we rolling candy for real.

D-Reck.
I've been all about the feddy, since titty milk was fed to me.
To them days on the block, when crack rock was leveling.
My Matchbox was stocked, and the knot in my sock was heavy.
With dreams of a drop, and a new spot for betting.
And a college degree, wasn't enough to feed me.
Ain't no small bidness loans, for niggas in these streets.
Saw whipped that flipped that, fuck a job I skipped that.
Start that dipped that, handed equipped gats.
Young entrepre-nigga, with ways to get paid.
Turned crumbs to bricks, Hoo-doo's to Escalades.
From hot heat to shades, try to stop me you getting sprayed.
I'm on feet like J's, the streets paved the way.
For a nigga to get the do', get the feddy get the cheese.
Shot off showroom flo', in a new V.
You gotta hand it to me, cause I'm demanding a G.
And that's respect, cause D-Reck gon collect you see.
