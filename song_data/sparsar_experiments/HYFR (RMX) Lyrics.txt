HYFR (RMX) Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


And you're so sad., It's too bad.. I wish you could've had what I had 
 
All my bitches crave the riches which they THINK I have 
They, don't understand that 
My money comes slowly and steady 
And. Only if everyone throws me some pennies 
For all these recordings. They don't even let me know about 
Until, it's like the day before 
At, like four in the morning.
