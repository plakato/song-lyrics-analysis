Defari Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway.

*after shoutouts*.

Defari.
Yo, I gets busy, throw a cat off me like a frisbee.
He test me, now he's Gillespee, now he's Dizzy.
Tiger strike pants, wear jiggy niggy.
Rather roll wit family like Agony Tha Philly.
Break my bucks for cuts to bucks Billy.
Throw the nice Avirex on when it gets chilly.
Catch the eye for dame holdin hands wit Willie.
When it comes to hands I SLAP Big Willie silly.
He says Yo Defair my man, what da dealy?
I say Cat, you about as fake as Milli Vanilli.
Me? My whole crew we get lifted.
Roll about as deep as the stars of the flag, fifty.
It's like this, it's like that.
Yo Chocolate Tye grab the mic cuz you swing a big bat.
