Kool-Aid Lyrics
by Ruse.

Not trill but I'm top-bill. I got skill and.
Cop will, you're not ill with your drop tops and popped pills.
Stop and watch as my pad fills, mad ill, Pop Rocks.
Track drops and I'm still crackin. Freebase that like crack rocks.
Let it burn. Breathe it in. Heed the words that leave the pen.

Beseechin vermin, keepin em workin, usherin in their recedin curtains.
Searchin, seekin purpose. I'll find a beat, it'll find me. I'm certain.
Don't mind me, I'm high....
Off the fruits of my labor and the paper is life.
If there's a God, Christ, you packed this tight.
I'm packin my bags tonight with Kool-Aid packets to pass me by.
I'm actually laughin like, dude, you know how fast I'd die?
I'll pass on demise and practice my passion. It's asinine.
To pass up on passin the average. Past the sky, my rap'll fly.
I'm out of this world. I maximize skill.
Everytime I practice lines. Yeah, Imma master my craft with time.
Tell the masses what my rhymes are amassin.
Amazin. Pass me the mic or Imma take it. Okay.
Rappin in my basement, makin massive statements.
The aim is that, maybe, they'll place me in a playlist.
Play this, nod your head, forget your placement.
Get lost in the music, okay? Taken away with.
Askin who's in action and rappin? The name is Ruse.
The conclusion of my Kool-Aid song so say.
