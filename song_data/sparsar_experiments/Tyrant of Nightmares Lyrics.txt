Tyrant of Nightmares Lyrics
by Xasthur.

Under full moons waxing lyrically.
Death's poetry floods the soul.
Like the freezing seed of a demon freed.
To curse the stars with vertigo.
And in their dance, in trance I've prised wide.
Slick rifts twist obsidian thighs.
Hymeneal gates to darker sides.
A glimpse of plinths where lies.

Haunted by this portent.
This obsession in my mind.
With a city sunk below.
Tall cedar groves and graves sublime.
Sporting their importance.
Marble wings spread to the skies.
A vale of dreams that it would seem.
The daylights race to leave behind....
