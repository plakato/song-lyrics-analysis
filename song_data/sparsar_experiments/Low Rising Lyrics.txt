Low Rising Lyrics
by The Swell Season.


I wanna sit you down and talk.
I wanna pull back the veils.
And find out what it is I've done wrong.
I wanna tear these curtains down.
I want you to meet me somewhere.
Tonight in this old tourist town.
And we'll go.

Low rising.
Cause we've gotta come up.
We've gotta come up.
Low rising.
Cause there's no further for us to fall.
Low rising.
Cause I fear we've had enough.
Low rising.
Oh, for the love of you.

I wanna take you to the rock.
I wanna jump right in.
And see what that big ocean's got.
I wanna turn this thing around.
I wanna drink with you.
All night, till we both fall down.
Till we go.

Low rising.
Cause we've gotta come up.
We've gotta come up.
Low rising.
Cause there's no further for us to fall.
Low rising.
And I fear we've had enough.
Low rising.
Oh, for the love of you.

Low rising.
Cause we've gotta come up.
We've gotta come up.
Low rising.
Til I fear we've had enough.
Low rising.
Cause there's no further for us to fall.
Low Rising.
Oh, for the love of you.

For the love of you.
Low rising, low rising.
I wanna sit you down and talk.
I wanna sit you down and talk about it now.
