In my Shoes Lyrics
by YUNG ROC.


Music , reality , Sometimes you try do your own best.
While some say you ain't good enough.
Sometimes you try to come out to limelight.
Trying to make things happen, and some say you are not part of it.
Here's the Story ....

RAP 1 :.
Uh, uh.
So try to stay focused.
No matter how they pull u Down.
No matter how dem try they'll always wanna pull u Down.
Outta town  this is the only truth I found.
Them be Fighting , them be hating.
They all wanna take you out.
This is reality I'm putting on paper.
Some are snitching on you.
Go ahead and make your cheddar.
That's the lifeline , No church in the wild.
Them Be opening all'em mouth wide.
N' Spitting all the Sh*t inside.
You's your own fliest.
So pick up all ya parachute and fly highest.
Don't let another hater Shhhhhhh silence.
Make u open up you mouth speak out Loudest.
Cuz I'm the Last Man Grinding.
I'm committed like the life line.
Arty Ready With ma game you should know.
I'm doing all my best its the Tip of the Aizbag.
Still hustling C-pex and the sway Swag.
I show u good loving in track with Harmony.
Still On the Bill Owo Yakpa like IczMoney.
I started Hip-hop when others Do hiccup.
Doing real beats you can call Me Real Playa.
Makachukwu This is Hip hop Aifee.
Iwe N'ewem when I'm spitting damn I feel.
Like Six Play y'all know the Words we say.
Ihe gala Afutawa afutawa Damn We Say !

No dey use Dem say dey judge Me.
No dey use Dem Say dey Fight Me.
Put yourself in my shoes.
Na who wear the shoe know where e dey Pain ooo.

RAP 2:.
Yeah , uh.
You know I might be smiling But I'm 2Shy.
No Alomo but I'm so high.
Dem dey vex cuz I too try.
As ma pocket dey e no dry.
No dey fall cuz I'm so Fly.
You dey feel me cuz I no lie.
Music is the drug if you're sick No Die.
Now Dem confessing , Roc you are Killing'em.
The Rhythm , the Rhymes ,Punchlines Are hitting'em.
They are sick , you are healing'em.
Lost , you are finding'em.
Like Stash you are counting'em.
Hands Never Falling'em.
Ochu nwa okuko Nwe ada.
Okuko Nwe oso , ina Achum I ga-ada.
Munwa akwuru oto.
Chukwu di n'imem agaghim atu ujo.
Gi n'achufu Agu , Mara na Oga Abia ozo.
You wanna get attracted , Go swallow Magnet.
You wanna get high , brother man Go Hynet.
I'm your Highness , no be alomo.
Oluwa don bless me why I no go Shomo.
Hate it or love it , the underdog's on Top.
I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop.
Go ahead and envy me ,I'm the rappers MVP.
And I ain't going Nowhere till you could get to know Me.

Ad Talks And Credits Till Fade.
