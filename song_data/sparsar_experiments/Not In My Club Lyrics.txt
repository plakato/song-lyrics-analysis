Not In My Club Lyrics
by ZMoney.


Bam, bam, bam, bam.
YMCMB, Nigga that's who we are.
We do Shit and Fuck Hoes all Day.
Let's do It again for My Real Bitches.
How long have You been Tryin'.
How long have you been dyin'.
How long has it Been since I Was Fuckin' Around.
Here Comes the Boom.
Here Comes the Niggas.
Someone wanna fight me.
I Bet ya ass No One does.
Tell Em S.M.D.
Boi if I Wasn't your Little Bitchy Bitchy Bitch.
I Would shit All over Ya.

Here comes the Flow.
You better Go, go, go.
Run up on a Ho, ho, ho.
Shoot her In the Head, So, so, so.
My Club is a Place for my Niggas to Dance.
Loud as Hell, Don't Worry Bout It.
I'm Like a Bitch with No Pussy.
I'm Gone.

You Better not Be Doin' That.
In My Club.
Yeah.
Not In My Club.
Not In My Club.
Not In my Muthafuckin' Club.
Bitch Cuz don't Need It.
You only do Shit in My club.
And Not In My Club.

Ah, Yeezy, Yeezy, Wassup Girl.
Who am I.
I Am Your Master.
Your Nigga.
Your Leader.
Your Waiter.
Your Hater.
Mr. West Is Who I Am.
Mr. Kayle Knows How to Do It.
Bride 2x: Kanye West.
