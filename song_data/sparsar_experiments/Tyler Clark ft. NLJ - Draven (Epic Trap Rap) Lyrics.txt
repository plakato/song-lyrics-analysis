Tyler Clark ft. NLJ - Draven (Epic Trap Rap) Lyrics
by Tyler Clark ft NLJ.

Yeah I'm back from the dead.
I was stabbed in the chest.
Thrown past the ledge.
One year later and I'm back for revenge.

In the flat we lived - they crashed it in.
I remember all the murderers she had to give.
A little bit to everybody.
But they got away - like it was an accident.

and they're already dead.
They just don't know it yet.
cause I follow them in.
Explosions, blow their heads.

\- it's the devil's night, while I'm.
watching them walk as I'm ready to fight.
But I stay on my grind.
Cause you know that it.
Can't rain all the time.

Fire it up.

No one will live and nobody will get away.
It's true.

And they heard a tap tap on the door.
\- I'll rap some more -- that's for sure.
And slash your corpse, grab the .44.
A massacre - but i can't die so i.
Pass the torch.

\- fire in your eyes.
And gas on the floor.
A match for my love.
As I laugh at your torture.

You attacked the girl.
\- and.
Now you're trapped in my world.

It ain't no hangman's joke.
I fade through shade and smoke.
-.
The pain you gave was unprovoked.
So I slay the gang in one stroke.

These lyrics that I wrote.
-.
She heard them as I spoke.
So.
I race through the maze.
Of a city to erase the faces.
I was laid to the grave.
With the crow.

And they're already dead.
They just don't know it yet.
cause I follow them in.
Explosions, blow their heads.

\- it's the devil's night, while I'm.
watching them walk as I'm ready to fight.
But I stay on my grind.
Cause you know that it.
Can't rain all the time.

Fire it up!

No one will live and nobody will get away.
It's true.
