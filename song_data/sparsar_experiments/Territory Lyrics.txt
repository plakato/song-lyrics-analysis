Territory Lyrics
by Vizual.


I will never sleep.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.
Time to take the land.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.

Wa-wa-wake up.
This is the battleground.
Sand glass drippin'.
I hear the trumpet sound.
He's coming back.
Like a thief in the night.
Stay in the secret place.
Without relations you'll   die.
Secret life on the line.
Having a good ride.
Just know you're missing the U-Turn.
For your last good-byes.
Evil flowing through your veins.
Devil's bloodline.
Still in my range Paganism.
Breaking this curse.
He doesn't rest.
He'll conjure those that left.
Blood of the Lamb paid the price.
To paid my bills and my debt.
You may be saved but not born again.
Common sense.
Is sin still the affection Yahweh.
Could heal you from those sinuses.

I will never sleep.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.
Time to take the land.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.

Life's about me.
Is it really though.
Last time I checked.
I can't tell the weather zone.
Got so much pride.
That I'm fallin' down slow.
Swimming than I sunk.
I'm drowning into the inner core.
Thought I was so bad.
But I failed sense.
Can't tell what was bad.
Living in sin.
Call me brainwashed.
Can't tell switch is switch.
Bad is good and good is bad.
Mindset corrupted.
Pride comes before the fall.
Yea I fell.
Nobody to get me up.
I call that a fail.
Christ taught me to humble.
And now I stand well.
Now time to take control.
Over my inner cell.

I will never sleep.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.
Time to take the land.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.

I'm in control my body is the spaceship.
My soul is the control station.
I need my boss Yahweh my tour guide.
Without direction I'm lost.
Breaking down suicide.
His Word is direction.
To find myself inside.
Food for my spirit.
My passion multiplies.
Letting this fire burn the seeds.
That got my hands tide.
Look at my face FREEDOM.
All over my whole life.

I will never sleep.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.
Time to take the land.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.

I will never sleep.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.
Time to take the land.
This is God's territory.
It's going down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down, down, down, down.
Down.
