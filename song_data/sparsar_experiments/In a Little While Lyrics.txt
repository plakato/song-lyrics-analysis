In a Little While Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Got a ticket coming home 
Wish, the officer had known 
What a day today has been 
Then. I stumbled through the door 
Dropping junk mail on the floor. 
When will this day end 
 
But? Then your letter caught my eye 
Brought the hope in me to life 
Cause. You know me very well 
And. I bet you wrote me 
Just to tell me 
 
In a little while 
We'll be with the Father.
