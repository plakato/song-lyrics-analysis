In a Little While Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Got a ticket coming home.
Wish the officer had known.
What a day today has been.
Then I stumbled through the door.
Dropping junk mail on the floor.
When will this day end?

But then your letter caught my eye.
Brought the hope in me to life.
Cause you know me very well.
And I bet you wrote me.
Just to tell me.

In a little while.
We'll be with the Father;.
Can't you see Him smile?
In a little while.
We'll be home forever.
In a while.....
We're just here to learn to love Him;.
We'll be home in just a little while.

Boy, that letter hit the spot--.
Made me think of all I've got.
And all that waits for me.
Guess I've known it all day long;.
Wonder where my thoughts went wrong.
When will my heart believe?

Waking half way through the night.
Reaching toward the lamp for light.
Picking up the Word I find;.
Here's another letter.
To remind me.

In a little while.
We'll be with the Father;.
Can't you see Him smile?
In a little while.
We'll be home forever.
In a while.....
We're just here to learn to love Him;.
We'll be home in just a little while.

Days like these are just a test of our will.
Will we walk or will we fall?
Well, I can almost see the top of the hill.
And I believe it's worth it all.

In a little while.
We'll be with the Father;.
Can't you see Him smile?
In a little while.
We'll be home forever.
In a while.....
We're just here to learn to love Him;.
We'll be home in just a little while.

In a little while.
We'll be with the Father;.
Can't you see Him smile?
In a little while.
We'll be home forever.
In a while.....
We're just here to learn to love Him;.
We'll be home in just a little--.

In a little while.
We'll be with the Father;.
Can't you see Him smile?
In a little while.
We'll be home forever.
In a while.....
We're just here to learn to love Him;.
We'll be home in just a little--.

In a little while.
We'll be with the Father;.
Can't you see Him smile?
In a little while.
We'll be home forever.
In a while.....
We're just here to learn to love Him;.
We'll be home in just a little--.

In a little while.
We'll be with the Father;.
Can't you see Him smile?
