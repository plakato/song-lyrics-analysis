The Gift Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


The stars appear along the treetops.
It can't be night until the sun is gone.
Taken from dawn.
So where I'll go is just a secret.
Between the dark and the cold mountaintops.
Dusk is falling.
The trail is old, but the trees are older.
And as I walk, I leave the Earth behind.
Out of my mind.
So off the path my body wanders.
Between the dark and the cold mountaintops.
I am calling.

I drift along just for the journey.
With only stars to tell me where I've been.
How far have i gone?
Like a sickness, it takes me over.
Between the dark and the cold mountaintops.
The Sun is rising.

Look up in awe.
The sky is what I want.
You've seen it all along.
And my heart is.
Burnin' up in stars.
Yeah, it's really not so far.

Although I search, I cannot find it.
An empty space within my memory.
A place of my dreams.
Perhaps someday, I will awaken.
Between the dark and the cold mountaintops.
Where dusk is falling.
