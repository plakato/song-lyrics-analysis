Real One Lyrics
by Quilly.

treat it like its nothin.
Now put ya bottles in the air if you a real one.
I knew I was a real one since a youngin.
She said she met a hitta and never met the real one.
She gon buss it for a real one.
And I ain't leaving out the county till the bills done.
Now who the hottest in the city, Im the real one.
Got everybody fuckin with me im a real one.
Now put ya bottles in the air if you a real one.

She gonn pop it, she gon drop it for a real one.

Streets love me im a real one.
And if she buss it open, throw some real ones.
I got a presidential Rollie its a real one.

Prolly cuz im a real one.
She gon buss it for a real one.
Now put ya bottles in the air if you a real one.
Im a take her to out while she tired of McDonalds.
I grew up in the projects, now look at how im stuntin'.
REAL! Im a real one. REAL!
She said she met a hitta and never met the real one.
She been with a lot of hittas, but never the real one.
Now who the hottest in the city, Im the real one.
Now put ya bottles in the air if you a real one.
Streets love me im a real one.

Got everybody fuckin with me im the real one.

She want a deep boy, she want a real one.

And them bitches they was frontin' now they buggin' cause im buzzin, But i.
