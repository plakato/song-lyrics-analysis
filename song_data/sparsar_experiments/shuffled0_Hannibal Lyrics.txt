Hannibal Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.

Look man, understand that I'm just mechanical.
Slowly crash your row boat on some yo-ho-ho it's me.
With uncanny mechanics so have a xanny and panic.
Shit had cost me almost every single friend I had.
Or any anti-D manics, tell and Annie and Danny daddy has been bad he won't be.
Sucker I been a great, I'll incinerate of up you second guess.
I'm arrogant, godliness is obvious when you notice me.
Heard she's sentimental we'll show her some gentle tenderness.
So take an interest or take it in the chest.
Ripping hosiery, calling out all the posery.
You ain't gotta trip if you can't hit the high notes.
Hit up Fashion late night and try to find a trendy lez.
Hatching a hundred plans while your clan would clamor for Danimals.
Motor boat flows like a fo'fo' rotary.
We could roll different flavors but miss me with that spendiness.
With with more than one ten I see, man I can see why these men are stressed.
Spark the mental ember then bag her quick as a ten of ses.
Gold flows got me up in your old hoe's ovaries.
Unorthodocks.
Ravenous caged animal, naturally savage mammal will.
Life is a game of chess and these suckers succumb to second best.
Hottest rapper in the valley, just look up what Syndee says.
That's that west side baby, catch me on the Indi Rez.
But then again I been a mess with the pen and pad.
Granted he ain't a fan of bull, ride the elephant; Hannibal.
Just jive with the live guys that ride live coyotes.
Some of these sorry showmen are overgrown in diplomacy.

I impose my will on the unskilled that's opposing me.
back....
Unless you bring your friend in that suspender dress.
Had to let it go just so I could bring it back.
Fiending like Jodeci just to flow to a Flying Lotus beat.
I know we ain't got bling or plaques but if you know it, sing the tracks.
Posting Go-Pro vids, hoping promoters notice me.
Damage glands and enamel for an inanimate tangible.
