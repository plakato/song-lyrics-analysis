{Young L}.
Uh, I'm tucked, I'm tucked.
Gotta tuck, I'm tucked.
I'm tucked, I'm tucked.
Tucked, gotta tuck - gotta tuck.

So much money tat I gotta tuck.
When people act funny I gotta tuck.
Shit not to mention I gotta be tucked.

{V-Nasty}.
Shit not to mention I gotta be tucked.
I don't know me, I don't know me no more.
Cuz I got bitches, I got bitches, they all think I'm homo.
I be sippin, had to quit sippin, I ain't off that robo.
Bitches be trippin', nigga I'm trippin', come in with that .44.

I'ma show these muthafucka's what they wanna see.
I be in the hood, I be wit my team.
I be tryna live my dream, nigga wanna funk, then I let it squeeze.
Nigga on the real you know you gone freeze.
Stop playin' wit me cuz you know I get the cheese.
My name's V-Nasty and I be in the streets.

You walk out the house, yo mom wishin' you luck.
The feds pull up, the thing gettin' tucked.
You fuckin' with them, then nigga you duck.
I pull up out the cuts nigga I'm tucked.
Nasty, yeah that's the muhfuckin name.
Don't throw salt on my muhfuckin game.
Why you kickin' dirt on my muhfuckin name.

Now I gotta flame, bullets got you, mane.
Niggas talkin' shit, they didn't know I'm insane.
I ain't gotta brain? Nigga what the fuck.
Posted on the block and I know I'm tucked.
