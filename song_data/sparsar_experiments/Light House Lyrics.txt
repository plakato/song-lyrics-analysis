Light House Lyrics
by The World Alive.


We stand up tall.
Even in the dark.
Never forget we are a light house burning.
They can't hold us back.
Never forget we are a light house burning.
We will shine on.
To bring us back home.

Sometimes I think I don't belong.
I need some words, can't find the song.
We all make a choice in life.
I pray that I'm wrong.

I can search in the endless sky.
For a reason to survive.
We all get lost at times.
In our broken minds.

Rise above the veil of fear.
Let them see your passion clear.
We all have voices.
Its time to be heard.

Wake Up.
Shine On.
This life is ours.

Refrain.
To bring us back home.
To bring us back home.

We will be shining on.
We will be shining on.

Refrain.
