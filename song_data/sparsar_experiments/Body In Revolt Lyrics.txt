Body In Revolt Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

There is something very wrong
With, my body with my soul
I laughed in the face of God
Now. It can't be controlled

I. Think these bones have a mind of their own

There. Is something sinister
Quickly taking hold of me
Misfortune coursing through my veins
Attacking. My anatomy

I think these bones have a mind of their own
I, can feel them shift and feel them. Disown

There is something menacing
Going on beneath my skin
Powerless to fight against
A rebellion. Within

I. Think these bones have a mind of their own

There. Is something terrible
Possessing, my very being
Organs shifting one by one
Planning, their insurgency

I think these bones have a mind of their own
I, can feel them shift and feel them. Disown

Believe me when I say
I'd rather be dead

I, can feel my body slowly tearing apart
I can feel my body slowly. Turning inside out

My eyes, they burn
My flesh it bleeds
My stomach it turns
Then, the darkness proceeds
The end is near
The. Uprising is here
Now. My body's committing mutiny

There is something treacherous
Wreaking havoc with my cells
Sinews, which once held me tight
Begin to bid me farewell

I. Think these bones have a mind of their own

There. Is something merciless
Creeping up my vertebrae
Infecting them all by the score
And? Now my marrow's gone astray

I think these bones have a mind of their own
I, can feel them shift and feel them. Disown

Believe me when I say
I'd rather be dead

I. Can feel my body slowly tearing apart
I can feel my body slowly. Turning inside out

My eyes, they burn
My flesh it bleeds
My stomach it turns
Then the darkness proceeds
The end is near
The. Uprising is here
Now. My body's committing mutiny

A life in disregard
Longs for the graveyard
The walls will run red
Red. With my blood and
I've been taught a lesson
I'll, never forget
Before the day is new
My, life will be, through

I can feel my body in revolt
I can feel my body in revolt
I can feel my body in revolt
I can feel my body in revolt

My eyes. They burn
My flesh it bleeds
My stomach. It turns
Then the darkness proceeds
The end is near
The. Uprising is here
Now. My body's committing mutiny
