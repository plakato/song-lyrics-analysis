Body In Revolt Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

There is something very wrong.
With my body, with my soul.
I laughed in the face of God.
Now it can't be controlled.

I think these bones have a mind of their own.

There is something sinister.
Quickly taking hold of me.
Misfortune coursing through my veins.
Attacking my anatomy.

I think these bones have a mind of their own.
I can feel them shift and feel them disown.

There is something menacing.
Going on beneath my skin.
Powerless to fight against.
A rebellion within.

I think these bones have a mind of their own.

There is something terrible.
Possessing my very being.
Organs shifting one by one.
Planning their insurgency.

I think these bones have a mind of their own.
I can feel them shift and feel them disown.

Believe me when I say.
I'd rather be dead.

I can feel my body slowly tearing apart.
I can feel my body slowly turning inside out.

My eyes, they burn.
My flesh, it bleeds.
My stomach, it turns.
Then the darkness proceeds.
The end is near.
The uprising is here.
Now my body's committing mutiny.

There is something treacherous.
Wreaking havoc with my cells.
Sinews which once held me tight.
Begin to bid me farewell.

I think these bones have a mind of their own.

There is something merciless.
Creeping up my vertebrae.
Infecting them all by the score.
And now my marrow's gone astray.

I think these bones have a mind of their own.
I can feel them shift and feel them disown.

Believe me when I say.
I'd rather be dead.

I can feel my body slowly tearing apart.
I can feel my body slowly turning inside out.

My eyes, they burn.
My flesh, it bleeds.
My stomach, it turns.
Then the darkness proceeds.
The end is near.
The uprising is here.
Now my body's committing mutiny.

A life in disregard.
Longs for the graveyard.
The walls will run red.
Red with my blood and.
I've been taught a lesson.
I'll never forget.
Before the day is new.
My life will be through.

I can feel my body in revolt.
I can feel my body in revolt.
I can feel my body in revolt.
I can feel my body in revolt.

My eyes, they burn.
My flesh, it bleeds.
My stomach, it turns.
Then the darkness proceeds.
The end is near.
The uprising is here.
Now my body's committing mutiny.
