When we had more time to play  .
Hold up, hold up, my nigga jus showed up  .
Im on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty  .

Ignorant mothafuckas  .

Nostalgia hittin major, at the time nothin could faze us  .

Wait a second, wait a minute  .

Im on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty  .
I can't close a dutch no more cause I got too much reefer in it  .
So i guess i miss the days  .
My nigga, here go the j like  .
Know what? roll up, get that L powed up  .
I'm on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty  .
Hold up, hold up, my nigga jus showed up  .
Freestyling causing ruckus  .
A-Z  .
Nobody had no jobs and nobody had no babies  .
  .
  .
My nigga just paid a visit  .
Couldn't stay in my ways  .
The most important things were basketball and ladies  .
My nigga jus paid a visit  .
