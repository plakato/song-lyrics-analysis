187 Yayo Lyrics
by 50 Cent.

{*set to Dr. Dre &amp; Snoop's Deep Cover instrumental*}.

50 Cent.
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
50 Cent nigga, Tony Yayo.
{WHOOOOOO... KID}.

Yeah! And you don't stop.
I do a 187 on your motherfuckin block.
Yeah! And it don't quit.
It's G-Unit in your motherfuckin ass bitch~!

Tony Yayo.
They say good things should happen to those who wait.
But I'm stuck in the game still slingin weight.
For that eggshell white, that tan and the brown.
For a XL-6 or a seven four pound.
Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better.
And with cameras in the mirror, nigga cars costs cheddar.
I'm on first class flights, with flyin cooks.

Now I'm blowin weed yo, in Beverly Hills.
With some bad freak hoes in the Montreal.
Next year it's the new Hummer, stash box with the llama.
I drive through in the blue data bomber.
Heaven or hell'll prevail when I'm a goner.
Cause I eat up tracks, like Hannibal and Dahmer.
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner.
Cause life is a hustle, any day you be a goner.
P89 Ruger with the silencer.
Let off a clip it sound like spitballs goin through straws.
We got, plenty of ratchets but not on sale.
We even got villagers that hold shotgun shells.
These rappers is talkin 'bout bricks in they rhymes.
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes.
I don't respect it, my work is never watered down.
So on the first I get mo' checks than Nike Town.
Sling in thirty-one hundreds, I been on the block.
Since niggas did the snake, running man and the wop.
When I was 15, I ain't want no workin papers.
I played the strip all night, servin niggas.
Listen nigga, we live like Italians in jail.
I got C.O.'s bringin cell phones to my cell.
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you.
Fill your ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil.
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid-fire.
I had you on the run like Omar on The Wire.
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run.
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun.
I'm a hustler, O.G.'s love to hate.
Cause I got old school money put away in the safe.
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at.
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback.
I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper.
Fuck Judge Wong, he won't catch me on the corner.
Nigga pay poor tax, homey you owe me.
You wanna rap we can battle for your see through Roley.
I be in M mansion, strippin them models.
His bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle.
There's too many indians and not enough chiefs.
Why you buy all the guns if you ain't got enough beef.
The shit I spit'll cause an all out riot.
And my new four-fifth'll cause a hollow-tip diet.
I'm the type to tie up your lady, and gun butt your baby.
I'm like the mob nigga, fuck you pay me~!
I'mma hide my assets, and disappear.
Make a quick twenty mill' and vanish in thin air.
I've finished my work now its time to cop.
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggage spot.
I need twelve 12's, and fifty-eight 58's.
Cause I got eight sales and they all gon' wait motherfucker!

YEAH!
{Ha ha... WHOOOOO KID!!}.
