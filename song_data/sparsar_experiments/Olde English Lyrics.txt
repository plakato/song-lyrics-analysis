Olde English Lyrics
by Uno Hype.


The lavish life.
Livin wrong hopin that the path is right.
Ye and hov told us this can't be life.
Getting all I want hopin that I had it twice.
A lot a livin to do before I die they on my fire.
That burns and pass the mike.
Ye and hov told us this can't be life.
Livin wrong hopin that the path is right, the path is right.

Don't give up nigga just keep goin.
That's what they told me so now I gotta show em.
When I'm tokin blow holes in they chest like what they totin.
What they smoking homie just don't provoke him.
He crazy wit dat I murdered they best shit.
They gon hate me for dat tryna get on my job they too lazy for dat.

Apologizing now too late for that.
This rap shit I was made for that.
Like who else was.
Killin everything like who else does.
Got different color broads like 3Ldub.
But we headed from the start getting everything.
So love don't lose yo heart you might well due to the mic skills.
Hype will put these niggas to bed like Nyquil.
Give all these niggas girlfriends slight chills mutha fucka.

The lavish life.
Livin wrong hopin that the path is right.
Ye and hov told us this can't be life.
Getting all I want hopin that I had it twice.
A lot a livin to do before I die they on my fire.
That burns and pass the mike.
Ye and hov told us this can't be life.
Livin wrong hopin that the path is right, the path is right.

Stuntin, frontin till the cold metal barrel.
Reach contact and gun clap the stuntin and the smile.
Which you got on my four t homie.
Once they put the work on the czp.
It'll be all you got now all you coped.
It's hard to stumble metal tearin through all you rock.
Shouldn't treat your self with the dollars you be stackin.
And packin a 9-5 you been workin since the nineties.
All this coke out here you workin yo ass off.
To buy some name brand shit you smarter than that dog.
Been in the hood like 20 years at least.
And still tryna keep peace wit niggas dat keep piece.
Niggas ain't tryna hear you sobbin chief.
I need to eat run up on son and rob his lease.
Jack boys rob meals from a slum dog.
Smarten up just the hood that I'm from dog.

The lavish life.
Livin wrong hopin that the path is right.
Ye and hov told us this can't be life.
Getting all I want hopin that I had it twice.
A lot a livin to do before I die they on my fire.
That burns and pass the mike.
Ye and hov told us this can't be life.
Livin wrong hopin that the path is right, the path is right.
