Ain't Gonna Be Treated This Way Lyrics
by Woody Guthrie.

I'm a-going down this old dusty road.
I'm a-going down this old dusty road.
O Lord God.
And I ain't gonna be treated this way.

I'm a-going where the dust storms never blow.
I'm a-going where the dust storms never blow.
O Lord God.
And I ain't gonna be treated this way.

My children need three square meals a day.
My children need three square meals a day.
O Lord God.
And I ain't gonna be treated this way.

I'm a-looking for a job and honest pay.
I'm a-looking for a job and honest pay.
O Lord God.
And I ain't gonna be treated this way.
