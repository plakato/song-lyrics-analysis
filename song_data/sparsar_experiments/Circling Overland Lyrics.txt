Circling Overland Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

1-1-2029, the stars are shining bright.

Nerves connected to the center, we are tied to the machine.
Invisible and silent, circling overland.
The plane makers designed us to out-turn and outmaneuver.
Intruders in our skies, intruders in our skies.

1-1-2029, tonight the stars are shining bright.

Backbone of the fighter force, of the defense industry.
Devoted tools of the power, warrants of the order.

1-1-2029, tonight the stars are shining bright.

Invisible and silent, we are circling overland.
Circling overland, circling overland.

Silicon advisors lead the way.
We reach our cruising altitude.

1-1-2029, West Europe, midnight.
Invisible and silent, circling overland.
Scanning, taping, filing, instantly checking.
Every human, car, and plane of the quarters we survey.

1-1-2029, circling overland, circling overland.
