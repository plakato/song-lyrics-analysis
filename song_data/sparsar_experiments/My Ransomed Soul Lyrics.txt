My Ransomed Soul Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

Buried in the heart of the earth.
Blood was shed for.
There for three days bearing my shame.
A world of men.
This man of sorrows despised for His love.
The blood at Calvary ransomed now oh my soul.

I deserve the cross I deserve a death for I am fallen.
Blood was shed for this world of men.
I deserve the cross I deserve a death for I am fallen.
Blood was shed for this world of men.

Something was deeply wrong if God had to die.
His body broken His blood was spilled.
Even after all we've done You still justify.
And Your words were spoken a life fulfilled.

I deserve the cross I deserve a death for I am fallen.
A Savior for the lost for I can't pay the debt of all of my sin.

Who is a God like you who pardons sin and forgives the transgressions of the.
remnant of His inheritance?
This understanding of a God who can save us for we deserve a debt that we.
could not pay.

Jesus paid it all.
All to Him I owe.
Sin had left a crimson stain.
He washed it white as snow.

A God who will save us.
A God who will love us even after all we've done.
To deserve a death of.
That of a traitor who speaks with the most treasonous lips.
