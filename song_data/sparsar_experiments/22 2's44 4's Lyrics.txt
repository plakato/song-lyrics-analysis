22 2's44 4's Lyrics
by QuayChronicles.


For anyone that thinks I wasn't meant for 
Or to anyone that hasn't heard me before 
Pissed at my 22'2s and 44'4's 
Must've forgot that Jay Z's, just an estranged mentor, 
It's a foreshadow for more of a raw battle, 
Slaughter time and guess who's selected to round up The
Cattle 
Cause, since I was 14, it was foreseen 
That I would forge morphene for fiends 
That codeine was designed to keep'em on lean 
That's, my fuel for my esteem, to succeed. 
For too many years I wrote rhymes and just hoard
'em 
I'm ready for showtime welcome to the forum, 
Too good for the pantheon, more of Warhol for y'all 
Piece together words, makin' murals for walls 
Now who dare come challenge; mines, 
None, step up with every four lines: 
 
In, my 4 cornered room plottin' to the et cetera, 
A vendetta, to heist the game for all the lettuce 
For, the getaway and I'll hideaway forever. 
In Cuba with 2pac, 4 Glocks and Assata Shakur ain't forget ya 
Forgive. My fortitude meant for it to be heard. 
Realize that I could put forth only four words 
And be able to force the culture forward, 

Welcome to Oklahoma's, mind Glad it could reach ya 
Cause. They don't look for us when lookin for a feature. 
Probably forgot that anywhere can be able to breed a 
Monster. That looks to demolish any sorta creature 
Oh. Now you for it pointin' askin', who he 
The, rap's reincarnation of the 2-3 
Led my mind to crazy shit. So you can relate 
And watch it fornicate with forbidden fruit for 4 minutes
straight
