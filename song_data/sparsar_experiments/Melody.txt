Melody
by Worthwhile.

Ground is always there to catch my fall. I get up.
Try to hold my own, but feeling all alone.
I sank at such a quiet and young age. Innocence was stripped away.
As a kid, I was forced to grow up in a single day.
Hoping. Praying. Wishing. Dreaming of something to save me.
I lose my fear in the sound of the melody. How sweet the sound.
I wanna live. I wanna breathe. I want my chin up not down on my knees.
The longer the shore, the greater the awe.
Oceans belong to those who dream.
And we find, you and I, in this balance above sea, below sky.
Never could I tell you what music means to my life.
It's like trying to describe a sunrise.
As words bleed to skin, it shows it makes a difference.
I feel alive in the sound of the melody.
My hope, is that the best is still ahead.
Cause there's so much more road to pave.
My love, the selfless plunge I take through your gracious wave.
I want it to be all I gave.
My life, good and bad, is all I have. I'll take it to my grave.
