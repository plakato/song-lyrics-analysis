Free Lyrics
by Virtue.

Rip the pages from the book of lies.
Never will we ever fall to compromise.
Now we're back to set the record straight.
Fueled by anger, our pain has turned to hate.

Symptoms of stagnation are coming to an end.
Solitude's frustration has been our only friend.
Now we must break free.

Mercy is no virtue when the mercyful is betrayed.
There must be some kind of justice before it's too late.

Right at you straight between the eyes.
This relentless attack will be no disguise.
Things have been said that just are not true.
Hear what I say when I say this to you.

Symptoms of stagnation are coming to an end.
Solitude's frustration has been our only friend.
Now we must break free.

Mercy is no virtue, that's what the merciless say.
When justice is lost, the system fails, and all we do is pay.

Take a look around, cause the band is back in town.
And vengeance and revenge is what they seek.
If you see them coming you better step aside.
Because now they'll show no mercy.
You can see it in their eyes.

Because mercy is no virtue.
