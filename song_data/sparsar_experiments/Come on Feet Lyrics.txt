Come on Feet Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Sample of Melvin Van Peebles.
Come on feet x5.

Come on feet, cruise for me.
Trouble ain't no place to be!
Come on feet, do ya thang, aw nah.
Come on legs, come on run ).
Come on knees, don't be mean.
Come on knees, cause that ain't the first red you've ever seen.
Come on feet, do ya thang.
Don't cop out on me.
Don't give in on me.
Come on legs, come on cruise for me.

Come on feet, cruise for me.
Come on run!
Anyway the way, I pick them up and put them down.
Even if they got my name on it, won't catch me now.
Never put us in some cold ass ground.
Sure was dark, never been out this late.
Anyway, safe and sound but we broke the olympic two twenty.
Cross country or something.
Whatever happened to the sun? Sure gone away.
Sure blacker than a landlords soul.
Must have run all day.
Must've run all day.

Come on feet, cruise for me.
Come on feet, come on run.
Come on feet.
Come on feet, come on run.

I played few tunes yesterday to sponsor.
Real cool, they digged it.
And the new album came in, it's at your local store, it's Quasimoto: The.
Unseen.
I'mma play another tune for y'all ?
If y'all sleep, you know, we're gonna have tears about this.
This is WCET 88.1 FM, midnight hour.
