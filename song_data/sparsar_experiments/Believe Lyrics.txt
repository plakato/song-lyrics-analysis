Believe Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

It's for the ones I miss.
And for those who believe.
For those unheard.
And for the ones unseen.

It's for those who're close.
And for those who're away.
For those who talk.
And for those who don't.

Each of you has got the thing.
That makes you stand above them all.
Each of you has got the thing.
That makes you strong.

It's so simple anyway.
There ain't no stronger.
There ain't no weaker.
There ain't no better.
And there ain't no worse.
There are people and people.
Don't tell me who you are.
Who you were.
Who you'll be.
Don't talk as someone that you'll never be.
Show me your real face.
Show me the real face.
It's for those who believe.
For you and me.

...We want to thank all those.
Who stood by us, helped us and.
Believed in us. We wouldn't make.
It without you. We want to thank.
Our families, friends and the.
Whole crew workin' for us. You.
Know who you are. Special thanks.
Go to our fans and people who.
Come to our gigs, the ones we met.
And the ones we'll meet. Sweet.
Noise's got a lot of respect for.
You. Be yourselves friends!

It's for those who believe.
For you and me.
