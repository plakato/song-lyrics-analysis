Writers block Lyrics
by Vivekverma.

Aight look at the fake friends shaking hands talking softly.
Mostly back standing to stab it yo.
Walk in to see you crying and sobbing.
Smilin back and faking faces.
But in the end wish you goodbye bro.
And the next day of morning with the friends calling then.
She walked up with a scent of rose.
Like a foxy model she make her body waddle.
Heard you story then mock and rattle.
Would you ever gonna stop or not?

Now i wonder what is the perfection in the relationship attraction.
Appearance ,money to keep run it.
Soft nature or a sex for resurrection strongly infatuation.
Like the way married on it.
Sometimes even its a big joke a crack for soft folk.
And they got locked and seek the last hope on it.
Days goes and goes with a puntured relationshit.
And worse then ever before with this shit.
And stuck between the wrong and right and beat the night with a fight.
And we gotta our feelin in handsome suicide.
Call me wiered or whatever when i tear.
The fact over the fake statement when i can't bear.
And i dont wanna battle for the medal.
Plus i can handle every problem like my role model.
Probably the problem seems to be clobber at every corner.
So we need a obama to osama as a bomber pop.

Everything goes down when goes up.
And either most of us frozed up and goes non stop for.
Here's i am jottin the writer block in the dark.
Of the pen of handicapped thought that jerkin off.
We work hard but the luck hurt as a rock.
Left the scar with a smart work to you.
M cockin my head talkin the fact that.
M freakin and thinkin haters are gettin kick by my fat leg.
Oh i think you get that you know where i am at ,writers block....
