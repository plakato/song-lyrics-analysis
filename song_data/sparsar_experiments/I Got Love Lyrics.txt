I Got Love Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


Huh huh, this goes out to all the real niggas.
Locked up, niggas in the street hustling to feed they family.
Know I'm tal'n bout, it's real Noke D.

I got love, for niggas hustling the streets.
Trying to stay up on they feet, trying to make they ends meet.
I got love, for my niggas doing time.
Locked down but they can find, with so much up on they mind.

Noke D.
I got love, for all my niggas in the street.
Packing the heat, maintaining staying on feet.
I'm number one in the ratings, that nigga from BMT.
And all those that hate me, I've been praying for you lately.

D-Reck.
I got L-O-V-E, for young and O.G.'s.
Who run in controlled streets, sell dope just to eat.
Born misunderstood, torn between bad and good.
Raised up in the hood, trying to get paid like they should.

Noke D.
You can't fade me with reality shit, I live I love it.
I push it I shove it, I grip it I hug it.
It's tug of war, with this Southern superstar.
About to let the whole wide world, know who we are.

D-Reck.
Dirty 3rd movie stars, country boys making noise.
On a mission with a cause, what you hear came from God.
You can hear it in my heart, see a soldier play his part.
Each one teach one what he's taught, keep his son from getting caught.

Noke D.
Man it's a movement, we choose to use music to do it.
And if that's too confusing, show love and gon Screw it.

I got love, for niggas hustling the streets.
Trying to stay up on they feet, trying to make they ends meet.
I got love, for my niggas doing time.
Locked down but they can find, with so much up on they mind.
I got love, for my niggas on the block.
Where the hustle never stop, ducking dodging the cops.
I got love, for my niggas in the hood.
My niggas doing bad, and my niggas doing good.

D-Reck.
I'm bout to reveal to you motherfuckers, the definition of real.
It's when a nigga refuse to face defeat, no matter how steep the hill.
When a nigga deal with responsibility, it come with getting older.
Like carrying his friends his family, and the community on his shoulders.
Cause he who get the paper, but never forget from where he came.
That leave a lil' something behind, for his kids not just his name.
It's he who learn to love, even the ones that hate.
And he who knows to forgive, is to be forgiven for his mistakes.

A3.
For niggas up on the cut, hustling hard to make a buck.
Jackers bust real niggas do duck, not trying to see they life destruct.
Some of these boys don't give a fuck, some of these niggas out here is stuck.
I'm grabbing the green and holding it up, inhale the smoke then dump the but.
For all my niggas who up in the Penn, twirling they life in 5 to 10.
No need to pretend I'm pouring up Gin, when niggas turn fake I blunted they.
chin.
9 to 5 be on that job, 24/7 he praising the Lord.
A lot of these niggas is scan'lous and fraud, but fuck what they say up on the.
teflon.
Who is you to judge a G, where were you at when we needed to eat.
Where were you when we were scared to sleep, but now you come trick beat your.
feet.
I put my faith in G-O-D, and cats that put they faith in me.
See lately the world is changing, prophecy's told and falsly claiming.
Lyrically aiming for my dogs, I'm the light up in the fog.
Up in this game I be's a hog, no time to stall they bound to fall.
I'm moving a round that's made of brick, I told you this that shit that stick.
I love my niggas my niggas is it, I got the ball so set the pick.

Yeah mayn, this for my niggas that had it hard.
Them boys holding down a job, know I'm saying.
Niggas in the gutter living like the mob man.
We still getting it man, Wreckshop to the G-R-A-V-E baby.
This Young Gott-O man, come on with it baby.

For real mayn, this your boy A3 baby up in here mayn.
We putting it down for all my niggas locked up behind them bars.
You know I'm saying, my niggas on the corner.
Trying to put food on the table, know I'm saying.

Them fathers that do what they gotta do, keep ya head up baby.
We got love for all y'all, get your bread.
