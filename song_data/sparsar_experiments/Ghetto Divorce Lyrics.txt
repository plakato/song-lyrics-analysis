Ghetto Divorce Lyrics
by Queen Pen.

Yeah, so I guess by the time you get this kite, I'll be ghost, right?
Yup, check it.

For too many years, I had yo back.
And for too many years, you gave me slack.
Tell me, what did you think.
That I was a idiot?
Or, how many years you thought i'd take yo shit.
I'm out, I'm leavin you wit the whips and the cribs.
In exchange for the kids, and my happiness.
Ghetto divorce, how real is this?
And oh yeah, tell you side bitch she _In Like Flint_.
I left enough food to last until the weekends.
And when its all gone, go eat wit your friends.
Since thats, who you cherish, more then me.
The one who carried every last one of your seeds.
The one who did a bid for you when you copped one and three.
The one who was on yo side when you copped yo first ki.
Me and you kid, we was meant to be.
Who'd think that the streets will make you flip on Queen.

I'm doin my thang, I'm movin on.
You won't appreciate a real bitch till shes gone.
Never mind the drama and don't bother callin me.
You'll never find a woman that looked out like me.

For, many years concentrated on you.
Lost focus on myself, seperated from my crew.
Allowed you to drain down, my soul slowly.
I'd rather be in the projects.
Then stress and luxeries.
So they're for I'm leavin you wit all yo ice.
That shit wasn't worth bein alone at night.
That shit wasn't worth worryin if you was alright.
So ignorant, you never knew your wrongs from your rights.
Never understood it was always about the respect.
Not about bein yo main chick wit begettes on my neck.
Not about bein me bein the baddest bitch in the hottest whip.
It was about you bein a real man to me and yo kids, yo heard.

I'm doin my thang, I'm movin on.
You won't appreciate a real bitch till shes gone.
Never mind the drama and don't bother callin me.
You'll never find a woman who looked out like me.
I'm doin my thang, I'm movin on.
You won't appreciate a real bitch till shes gone.
Never mind the drama hang yo lame apology.
You'll never find a woman who looked out like me.

True I, made the choice to a wife to a thug.
But you gotta understand, at first it was about the love.
But now, I don't know who the fuck you are.
I thought I never say I misswhen the times was hard.
When all I had was you, and you had me.
Instead of pushin big boys, we was pushin our feets.
I never shitted on you, stricly loyalty.
I lived how you lived, by the codes of the streets.
But you broke that son, when you flipped out on me.
You'll never find another chick that'll hold you down like Queen.
Never, another chick that'll help you grip yo bricks.
Never, another chick will love you without yo chips.
Tha'll ride up in a hooptie, as well as a six.
You gon miss me when I'm gone.
P.S. it was real kid.

Uh huh, Miss Jones break it down.
How you feel about this.
