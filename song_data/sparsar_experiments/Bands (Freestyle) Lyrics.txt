Bands (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Quilly.

.
Fish Scale on the Block we Goin Fishing.
Ain't nothin on it though the work skinny-dippin.
Put it in the pot call it synchronizing swimming.
Next Day 20k bussin out My Linen.
I ain't got this Glock for nothin Nigga I Send dem.
All these bad Bitches get curved after i bend dem.
Niggas think they fuckin wit Quilly it ain't there though.
These niggas you think thurl they all weirdos.
I get a baldy kill you let my hair grow.
I stand in the Field by myself like A Scarecrow.
I used to fronted stack packs bringin nickel packs.
Now I send niggas Outta town bring me triple back.
Yea! I made myself a boss.
I used to want lo but i settled for lacoste.
Doctor give me lean, I make myself cough.
I ain't know how to pitch I made myself tall.
If I get the drop you get sent to the sky.
I send niggas in ya crib Xfinity Live.
Fake trap niggas talkin bout flippin dem pies.
They ain't even touch pastries Im sicker than lies.
I gotcha bitch at the loft slidin dick up her thighs.
These bitches givin up the puss They shoulda listened to Piles.
Nigga you Rue Paul I can see the bitch in ya eyes.
Remind me of Bruce Jenner Just A bitch in Disguise.
I make a smoker wipe my wheel off, give em advice a .20 piece then i Peel off.
If I'on owe my publishing I cut the whole deal off.
Just left Phlipe's and i Knocked my whole Meal off.
Quilly Eatin good no more PB&amp;J'S.
Them labels knockin on my door cuz they Seee the Wave.
Im gettin paid for the walkthrough.
My shooter gettin paid for the drive by.
I told this bitch jump she said  how high ?.
My niggas smokin on Ivory like How High.
My face on the bus see me every time you look up.
.
Read between the lines nigga scared to pick a book up.
Coke so good you get high from the cook up.
Nigga we can go to war like Afghanistan.
Ciroc lifestyle but I came from Amsterdam.
I carry tools like a handyman, Spin ya block with all my cousins in a family.
van.
