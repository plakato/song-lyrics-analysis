INSIDE BOY Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Inside boy, yeah.
Inside boy, yeah.

She gets me woozy.
Chasing for that coochie.
Give her the Hitchcock when we're making a home movie.
Yeah, she my cutie.
Can put the blow in Hootie.
This shit is Disney.
I'm the beast and she's the booty.
Met her when she was a freshman.
My friends were like, you hitting?
I was like, yes man..
But it was more than that.
Had me poppin' off the top, I lose my starter cap.
Blood was rushing down, and I don't mean a heart attack.
I mean all of that.
Reading Braille off her garter strap.
Oh I got it bad.
I can draw her body with a pen and pad.
She got me thrusting like a rocket off of Cape Canav.
And there ain't nothing wrong with that.

That's that new new rich, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
Like a ru-rude bitch.
Steal that shit out your Gucci.
I'm do, do this.
Poppin' off like an Uzi.
And hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy.

Coming off as kind of weirdo.
She said that she liked my beard though.
Imma get her to speak in binary.
By the end of the night.
Barring a fight of a possible blackout.
We could sneak out at the back door.
And kiss like Spiderman pulling his mask down.
Am I speaking too fast now?
I see you poking that ass out.
Fold 'em or hold 'em.
Fuck it, I should just go and cash out.
But I got no doubt, no Stefani that you want me.
Gonna hold it out, till you blow like kamikaze.

Inside boy, yeah.
I ?
Inside boy, yeah.
You don't know me.

That's that new new rich, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
Like a ru-rude bitch.
Steal that shit out your Gucci.
I'm do, do this.
Poppin' off like an Uzi.
And hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy.

Inside boy, use my inside voice.
Here to make some noise.
Pissing on your boyfriend's Rolls Royce.
Like I had a choice.
Making sacrificial offerings to annoy the demon that's been bursting from my.
dreams like every night.
Like give me something to believe in.
Oh I fucking need it.
I've been drinking on the weekend.
Diving in the pool and waking in the deep end.
Raging while you're sleeping.
Call me Scottie Pippen, cause I've been steady pimping ever since I started.
breathing.

That's that new new rich, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
Like a ru-rude bitch.
Steal that shit out your Gucci.
I'm do, do this.
Poppin' off like an Uzi.
And hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Till we get woozy.

Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy.
