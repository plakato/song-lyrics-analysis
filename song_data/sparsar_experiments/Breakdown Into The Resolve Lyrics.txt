Breakdown Into The Resolve Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Hi, hello, its me again, don't worry ill talk slow.
Wow, you probably heard I went away.
Where do we start from?
I know.
From the breakdown, into the fold.
The breakdown, another black hole.
Like a shadow in the light, stand up and be counted.
I was born to be betrayed, it's clear that I'm clearly afraid of.
So its one for every year.
Its pitiful what I hold dear, I throw away.
And so, it still comes and goes.
It's better now, that I get these bad ideas, I get my dreams.
confused....wishes.
Bad ideas, bad ideas to lie me down and get into the resolve.
I forgot, how long it was since I had a thought that wasn't.
Dark yet I know I hate myself a lot.
The breakdown into the fold.
Breakdown, another black hole.

Like a shadow in the night.
The shows over shows over.
I was born to be afraid, alright.
And so, its one for every year its pitiful what I hold dear, I throw away.
No, it still comes and goes.
It's better but I get these bad ideas.
I get my dreams confused with my wishes.
Bad ideas.
Bad ideas.
To lie me down and get into the resolve.
Do the resolve, do the resolve.
Do the resolve, do the resolve.
Do the resolve, do the resolve.
