ME Lyrics
by Rumor.


I'm in a room full of people yet I feel lonely.
I'm a kid named Rumor but yet nobody knows me.
No buddies no homey everybody is ghostly.
Shuffling my thoughts, hoping somebody owes me.
No groceries, I'm a hungry boy.
Looking for greener pastures, herbivore.
Nevertheless I didn't mean that for the metaphor.
These painful rhymes I'm pouring out my heavy heart.
I've been there before, I still hear'em.
Voices laughing at my passion when they hear'em.
Still look above at the stars and leer'em.
How could I not be closer to my dream when I'm near'em.
Its been a few years down the line.
I could tell you, I been patiently waiting to get signed.
The sky is your limit heaven is mine.
Here's the blueprint of the new rap design.

My life, My life.
I've been longing for this time.
My life, My life.
I've been waiting for this moment.
To tell you my story.
My ups and downs, I've been around.
Now I'm back in full glory.
Victory, Victory.

Kicked off 2G9 with a bad disorder.
Got weirder towards the end of the last of the quarters.
When I met a lovely lady a preacher's daughter.
It got a little ugly when her parents discovered.
The relationship said it was best we quit.
That the family's too conservative for rap music.
Maybe I never told her that she was my muse.
And I relish every single moment the rendezvous.
I had fallen so much in love and then you cut me loose.
How could I expect to fall and not get bruised.
But, It's all good.
At the end of it all I found Jesus who through you made me a believer.
Its like my life's a song and you a feature.
Well here it is can you hear it through your speakers.
Now all I have is my pen and my pad.
I'm in my own class and life's my teacher.

Story of my life a bit of it is gross.
Mary Mary said we need a little dirt to grow.
I know I have a lot to be thankful for.
Coz I vividly remember sometime before.
Daddy fell from Grace to grass.
And even though grass is green I tell you ironically we never had cash.
It happened in a flash his business collapsed, how sad.
Me and daddy skipped breakfast and lunch.
So we could eat at night coz there wasn't much to munch.
To feed that hunger I gotta to be the hunter.
This game's the only thing left to hunt.
And now we're shooting stars, no homicide.
I've come thus far from the other side.
The devil may try hard to pulverize.
But I'm a child of the Lord its bona fide.

I've come thus far from the other side.
It's bona fide.
Maybe I never told her that she was my muse.
And I relish every single moment the rendezvous.
These painful rhymes I'm pouring out my heavy heart.
