Doomed by Howling Winds Lyrics
by Xasthur.

The wind cast a ruin upon my soul.
The night is dying, yet we cursed the dawn.
Each mourning, upon a festering grave.
The moonlight has no shine through the doom.
The burning corpse of god shall keep us warm.
In the doom of howling winds.
For we are a race from beyond the wanderers of night.
