All Alone Lyrics
by Swelo.


I'm all alone in my house.
Ain't nobody to save me.
Ain't nobody to hold me through the night.
Through the night.

And I know you wanted this to happen.
Cause I see you boogie steppin'.
So go on and keep on dancing.
Through the night.
Night.
Night....

Dance like nobody's home.
Like you're all alone.
Grab your microphone.
And dance, dance, dance, dance.

Dance if you wanna feel outta control.
And dance like you never ever danced before.
And go on, shake what your mama made you for.
You know you gotta make moves you never made before.

Ok now hands on your knees then hands in the sky.
Bump to your left and bump to the right.
Now down to the floor 'till it feels just right.
Now do it again, 'till you meet your wife.

Ok now hands on your knees then hands in the sky.
Bump to your left and bump to the right.
Now down to the floor 'till it feels just right.
Now do it again, 'till you meet your wife.

Reprise.
I'm all alone in my house.
Ain't nobody to save me.
Ain't nobody to hold me through the night.
Through the night.

And I know you wanted this to happen.
Cause I see you broke a step in ?
So go on and keep on dancing.
Through the night.
