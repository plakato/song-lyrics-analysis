Am i safe - live at the village Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

All these things keep running through my mind.
Everyone and everything I left behind.
Standing in the cold great dark.
Watching cars go by.
And all these things keep running.
Through my mind.
Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe?
If I don't wanna be with you.
Every day my heart seems like a stone.
Carries me away into the undertone.
At the bottom, there's no air, there's no sound, no light.
And all these things keep running.
Through my mind.
Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe?
If I don't wanna be with you.
Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe?
If I don't wanna be with you.
On my way back on my sea of heart over.
Close my eyes, but if it wasn't mine.
It's complicated, I just don't love you anymore.
I just wanna sit here and watch it burn.
Sit and watch it burn.
Sitting look at someone through the world.
Running from myself like when I was ejected.
Pictures in on the wall, when we used to smile.
All these things keep running.
Through my mind.
Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe?
If I don't wanna be with you.
Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe?
If I don't wanna be with you.
If I don't wanna be with you.
