Common Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.

F/ Common 
, 
Common 
Yeah, I act like heroin. I prepare lines 
For those who never knew about the flow up on this 
Common Sense. Evolution right up on the mix, 
The revolution will not be televised. 
This is what I do. I tell the guys 
I, never tell no lies, I'm the truth. 
Sittin' across the table from corporate lies. 
I said that in the sixth sense 
Yo I go on and on like a run-on sentence, 
Common Sense is searchin' for repentance 
From a lot of wach brothers 
It's. Like this, I used to love her 
I. Remember the brother who had his mother on the record cover 
The last album one day it made sense. 
Common Sense is comin' like ths for the present 
What. Can I do when I see these pretty? Ladies 
If, I see one good enough. I'M stab like Jay-Z 
Ah man. I got ta chill with that. 
That ain't. What went down Common Sense sense sounds around 
Come on now got ta chill. 
You can't tell that I'm down with K-Mell 
Or flip it. You know how we gel 
Common leader check it out. Common Sense will feed ya 
A little bit of rhymes people know the times 
I'm rhymin' great, my album's comin' on the 28th of March 
Y'all. It'S like that baby. What 
 
Talking 
Yeah he's still in there he's still in there 
I wan na hear something written 
Ok. Ok, ok check it: 
 
Common, 
Women cry children laugh men, dance, 
I, refuse to lose self tryin' to win fans over 
Weight on my should fluctuates like Oprah 
My, refridgerator poetry magnetic like Ultra 
You. Couldn'T hang if you was a poster 
 
Talking, 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Alright. What'S next on the mic: 
 
Common 
Yo bust it Denzi, Benz, jeep, ten freaks behind em', 
M P's and rhymin' M 3's and dimin' 
Empty ya. Nine! If you attempting to rob them stars 
While, they getin' money from Mr. Long Island. 
Give me that paper dog. I got ta, have it 
Might lift a pocket, so money is automatic. 
We, the fourth of carats 
And, you still lookin' sort of savage 
It's a whole lot of money out there, you aught to grab it 
Alright rippin' on the mic. 
All night put my nigga Sway on the mic
