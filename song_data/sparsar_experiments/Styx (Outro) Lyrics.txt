Styx (Outro) Lyrics
by XamVolo.

Running fast, the river rhythm drags along their bodies.
I feel sorry for their fathers if they work it out.

Gotta go.
These pots of gold have gone to waste so I gotta go.
Oh these stories that I've told; gotta go.
Gotta go, gotta go.
Just put it all on my shoulders.
These souls are so cold, they're.
In need of water.
Take a look at what you see in front of you.
Take a look at what you see in front of you and-.
Notice that you can't understand where I'm coming from.
Don't think that you can understand where I'm coming from...
