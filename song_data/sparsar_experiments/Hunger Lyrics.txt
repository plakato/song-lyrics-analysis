Hunger Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.


Oh, I got the hunger.
It moves but won't lose it.
I'm not gettin' younger.
I use it, abusively.

I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
It's takin' me under till it takes me away.
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
I won't surrender, till it takes me away.

It's been five years waiting for the unfold.
Throat sore on swallowed gold.
Sick of being sick ,tired of these wired ways.
It won't save me,it won't replace me no.
I got the hunger it will not let go.
I got too many worlds to know.

I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
It's takin' me under till it takes me away.
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
I won't surrender, till it takes me away.

It's been too many times, I've tested cells.
Waiting on point Nemo, absolute Zero.
Mother Lung, gimme a hard shake.
Self-abuse maze i gotta break.
It won't let up, it won't save me, no.
I got a hunger that will not let go.
I got too many worlds to know.

I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
It's takin' me under till it takes me away.
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
I won't surrender, till it takes me away.

And it's all that I want.
All that I want.
All that i need.
And it's all that I want.
All that I want.
All that i need.

I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
It's takin' me under till it takes me away.
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
I won't surrender, till it takes me away.
