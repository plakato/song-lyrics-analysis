Surface Lyrics
by 3 Shades of Blue.


Standing at the corner.
Nobody can see her.
The beginning of a life.
Mistakes become a blur.
Driving on her way.
Trying just to leave it.
Running and-a hiding.
Trying to stop the crying.

Believe it.
Believe it.
That's not the right way.
That's not the purpose.
This isn't worth it.
Tryin' to rise up.
To the Surface.

Tryin' to rise up.

Ten feet away.
He has to make a break.
He's lookin' at his life as a big mistake.
Will he drive home?
Will he turn back?
Road signs show him where he's at.

He's leaving.
He's leaving.
That's not the right way.
That's not the purpose.
This isn't worth it.
Tryin' to rise up.
To the Surface.

Tryin' to rise up.

Don't give it up.
Life's not what you see.
There's a greater love.
That will always be.

Open up your eyes.
Try to realize the truth.
'Cuz love is in the air.
And its burning everywhere for you.

Don't give it up.
Life's not what you see.
There's a greater love.
That will always be.
