Check Out Time Lyrics
by 50/50 Twin.


Say, can I holla at ya.
Come here mayn.

50/50 Twin.
Vibrate like a vibrator, you vibrant thang.
Back it up on my brain, so you can see how I hang.
Once you give me the green light, ain't no stopping my game.
I hid my necklace in my pocket, ain't no bopping my chain.
Let's go post up by the bar, drink Grey Goose and waste time.
So many curves, girl you need a slippery when wet sign.
Hoping after this your mine, I'm trying to spit my best line.
A million kids on your spine, I'm busting like a tech nine.
Now one...two...three...four.
When it's time to exit, meet me by the front door.
Five...six...seven...eight.
If you don't, another dime piece will fill in ya space.
You searching for a trick, then go find Whodini.
Don't get me wrong if you hungry, I'll go buy you Denny's.
You wanna see money in hand, I'll provide you pennies.
Andrew Jackson plus two, under my ride is spinning.

If you know why you going, then hop right in.
In other words, be prepared for a one night stand.
After I nut, my kindness gon stop right then.
think it ain't, get your clock right then.

50/50 Twin.
We at the room, now I'ma tell your pretty ass nicely.
There will be no sleeping, I can lay up with wifey.
I ain't tripping on the cost, I can pay what the price be.
Hotels are for teenagers, I got us a tight suite.
Call someone to rob me, I'll pop you and them too.
Me and my gun fin to shower, you get in when we through.
I come out it's on the flick channel, you a freak too.
Think I ain't packing cause I'm short, I'ma teach you.
We doing it and doing it, and doing it well.
Don't lick my lips like LL, but mami good as hell.
Sometime it take me ten minutes, but my wood stood well.
If I was a simp, I'd probably let you push V-12.
I enjoyed your time, and yes I do have a number.
But I think its best, if we keep bumping into one another.
Now be a good woman, and go home to your husband.
Oh yeah don't be stalking me, when you see me out clubbing.

50/50 Twin.
My reason for this rhyme, is I have no love at all.
Men use to be dogs, now women have em come to dogs.
A lot of you dudes get some ass, once and offer cars.
I call a bitch bitch so much, she think I'm Too Short.
You wonder why I call ya bitch, come on I bet ya.
Stop wondering and go suck dick, don't lift your head up.
You want your boy to spark your wrist, and get your nails done.
I'll take ya money and tell ya get, some'ing like a bails bond.
Handcuffed , spend bucks.
Me in a tux , please don't leave me.
The mink arm rest hug your waist, while you sit on glass.
I'm gon cheat and make your day great, like the weather bad.
I'ma cap and cap a slap her, go 'head hoe press charges.
I never touch jail, I sell blow to the sergeant.
My past experiences, make me treat hoes harshly.
It's like it's ice on my heart, cause I'm so cold hearted what.
