Omnivore Lyrics
by Volcanoes.


Bury our faces in the ground, cause our hands won't stand.
We'll close our eyes just to hide, but we'll find it's even worse inside.
I can't move my body but my mind is runnin'. It's runnin'!
Bury our faces in the ground; here she comes, here she comes!

Let's talk about the things we shouldn't do, lets talk about the things we've.
done.

Tag.
Take! A! Seat! Let's! Just! Breathe.

How can you talk with my heart in your mouth? Oh!
I don't even know what your sayin'.
All I see now is your eyes and my reflection, distorted.
Your words form hands around my neck and chew up my heart.

Take! A! Seat! Let's! Just! Breathe!
Lay! By! Me! Let's! Just! Sleep/.
