Soulhunter Lyrics
by Voice.

The day has lost his innocence.
And the night spreads her winds across the sky.
The shapes of the darkness creep from her caves.
And extending her claws toward us.

Cold floats by my body.
And clasps my heart with icy hands.
I feel the magic.
Its power as it dances with me.
One thousand hands start to reach for me.
One thousand voices arise.
Broken hopes remembering.
To long forgotten times.

Lies and feelings sold.
It's prisoners of the misery.
Tormented souls, betrayed faith.
On the flight with the pain of the eternity.
Who's destroyed their dreams?
Till the end of all times.
Who can still heko them now?
Who stands by their side?

The memory of stories long forgotten.
Slowly cuts its way through my mind.
I don't want to pay for the cruelty of these sins.
Because their souls were blind.

Blind with the hope of redemption.
And the faith in the eternal bliss.
They followed insanity.
And its sacred leader up to death.
Hot blood flows thorugh my veins.
The lights of the town they are still so far.
I feel anger.
Like it surrounds me.
With its icy embrace.

Lies and feelings sold.
It's prisoners of the misery.
Tormented souls, betrayed faith.
On the flight with the pain of the eternity.
Who's destroyed their dreams?
Till the end of all times.
Who can still heko them now?
Who stands by their side?

Lies and feelings sold....
Lies and feelings sold....
Who's destroyed their dreams?
