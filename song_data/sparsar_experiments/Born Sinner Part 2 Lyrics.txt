Born Sinner Part 2 Lyrics
by Wordplay.


I am a sinner, who's guaranteed to sin again.
I ain't a Christian, I ain't no Christian.
But that shouldn't determine your hate.
Listening to music on the track.
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe.
I can feel your hatred from to light years away.
I got my spikes and my inhaler, I'm usually laughing but right now I'm saying.
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe.
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe.

Ask me why and I'll tell you the reason why I wanna make it in track.
Money and fame is nice and all, but it's not it and that's a fact.
Grandmama always wanted to see me run, when she was on this planet.
Left the Earth in 2011, hurt me so bad but I ain't let nobody see that.
Since then, to myself, imma take track more seriously for her sake.
No God-fearing nigga, so all that shit that happened to me, it's fate.
Looking at the 2012 State vid, I am leaning on that 2 hard.
Yessir I am black and yeah I run track, but nigga don't pull the race card.
Don't be racist, I ain't going to college just for some athletic gain.
Gonna figure out ways for Blacks in society to have less pain.
And when a hater critiques my track skills, it goes through one ear and out.
the other.
We two different people, you run for the fame while I run for my late.
grandmother.
After this track, when you see me at a track meet, you know what's on my mind.
So be courteous homie and not ignorant and bitch don't kill my vibe.
Mi-Mi this's for you, Word.

I'm a sinner, and imma sin again.
I'm a loser, but imma win again.
And I'm a loner, don't fuck with people's trends.
And I am a viber, so bitch don't kill it.

I stay prayed up, we stay dreamed up.
Shout out t my fam, me and Word Play we done teamed up.
Fuck all these haters nigga y'all know I stay schemed up.
Keep your head above water like fuck Bush and FEMA.
I just wanna gold pager and a Beamer.
Or some fresh ass Dunks that cost a guap.
I never really had it but spend like I got a lot.
I be wasting time like I don't own a fucking clock.
My life is like a movie tell me who about to watch.
They arrested me for killing bars but I will never stop.
I go to the fucking top, I climb rocks I don't do 'em.
RIP to my fam, I know you prolly knew 'em.
We don't understand the picture cause the way that they construe them.
They love to cloud our vision with these chains and these gangs.
We barely off the slave ship, now they're corporate planes.
We all vanity slaves, we carry these slave names.
Vibe life I get it, vibe like the realest.
All up in the sky cause we don't know the fucking ceiling.
We just know these leaky roofs, we are the broken youth.
But I swear if I don't make it, I'd change my name to living proof.
