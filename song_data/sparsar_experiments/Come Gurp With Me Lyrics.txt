Come Gurp With Me Lyrics
by Z-Man.


I crawl outta bed about 8 in the mornin' 
Start gurpin' 8:30. Today is my birthday 
It's august 14th and I'm guzzling Rossi. 
I got me a 40 ain't, nothin' gon'. Stop me 
I'm awfully faded made it to a new year. In my life, 
And everything's fine 
My, mind is altered at all. 
The party must start 
When, ending I'm pushing rewind 
 
Now come on and gurp wit' me 
Getcha boogie on 
And come on and gurp wit' me 
Little sister now 
And come on and gurp wit' me. 
Bring, your momma too 
And come on and gurp wit' me 
We can all get down 
 
There's more on the grill, as we blazin' 
I puff on the dust and you takin' 
Your eyes are swelling with blood and I love it. 
We done it with juice and goose on her stomach 
I need you to come and take shots of this lager. 
Don'T bother with chases you'll. Thank me. Come swallow. The Hypnotic tonic 
Your chest is burning from drinkin' okro 
The kitchen is snow. 
 
Wear tuxedos 
Push bleached through needles 
So, I don't catch nothin come holla. Man 
We drank our last dollar to dream about nothin, but livin and lovin 
No trippin, just kissin and humpin 
You suckin that nose candy, 
For, o's Brandy, man. She needs weed 
She's crawlin, the wall, 
Breakin' her nails and heels 
Throwin' her crank man, I'm off to the banquet 
I'm hungry as fuck 
 
Gurp-ology 
Got me following 
Crowds, who smile and swallow'em down 
So, proud to mix the clear with brown 
Into grey. Now sip grapes hit lace, 
An eighth, to the face. While I chase the drag 
Splash and askin' your momma for dank 
I pour a drank for PBF1 
Will of fiti 
My boy, Jon Jon 
Its on the keg is full of Heineken. 
Brew r.i.p goes out to D 
My girl's a problem. The other girls hate her 
They hate. When I bring her to parties like this 
Cuz, she don't know shit about drankin' 
Can't relate I shouldn't've brung her at all 
Hallucinating 
Mushrooms. In my tea 
Addicted to 40's 
Good times, good weed,
