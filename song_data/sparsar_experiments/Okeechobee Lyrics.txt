Okeechobee Lyrics
by Wrinkle Neck Mules.

Looks like it's time to trim the fat.
Digging a hole right through the glades.
And by the time we get through.
Well, I'll have no use for you.
Won't you be so proud of the mess I made?

With my sweet, sweet, sweet Okeechobee.
Runnin' through the shallows.
With cottonmouth cypress knees.
Yeah my sweet, sweet, sweet Okeechobee's.
Calling me, with a forearm tan.
And a bottle that's where I'll be.

One time I brought a woman friend home with me.
For too damn long she couldn't stand the heat.
Damn mosquitoes.
She said I had to choose.
But she never thought she'd lose.
But when it comes to the one I love.
It's plain to see.

It's my sweet, sweet, sweet Okeechobee.
Runnin' through the shallows.
With cottonmouth cypress knees.
Yeah my sweet, sweet, sweet Okeechobee's.
Calling me, with a forearm tan.
And a bottle that's where I'll be.

A four-wheel drive and a three-gun rack.
Two-eyed stove in a one-room shack.
Yeah my paint job's starting to peel.
And there's a crack in my windshield.
But you can bet each time I leave.
I'll be looking back.
To my sweet, sweet, sweet Okeechobee.
Holy black water with sawgrass citrus trees.

Yeah my sweet, sweet, sweet Okeechobee's.
Calling me, with a forearm tan.
And a bottle that's where I'll be.
Yeah, you can find me with a forearm tan.
And a bottle, that's where I'll be.
