No Vices Lyrics
by The Undead.


No vices.
How boring it would be if we had.
No vices.
What a drag to be straight all day and night.
No drinks, no drugs, no sex, nothing!
No vices.
How boring it would be if we had.
No vices.
I'm down on my kness.
Give me a drink, pill, a smoke, anything, I'm bored to death.
No vices.
How boring it would be if we had.
No vices.
I'm down on my kness.
Give me a drink, pill, a smoke, anything, I'm bored to death.
