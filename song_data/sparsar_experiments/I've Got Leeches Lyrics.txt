I've Got Leeches Lyrics
by The Zolas.

I am a crab from the sea of black.
And you're the barnacle on my back.
Yeah you're the tooth that I can't extract.

I am the crow from the building juts.
And you're the tinfoil in my guts.
Yeah no one struts like a blackbird struts.

I've got leeches under my clothes.
And I can't reach them.
I've got leeches under my clothes.
Nobody can see them.
I've got leeches under my clothes.
And ooh, they're achin'.
As they suck the blood from our conversation.

I used to go to school on Saturdays.
The ladies told us God was in everything.
But one of those ladies had to wear a wig.
And then one day she was gone, and she didn't come back.

Bottle depot man with thalidomide hands.
Tells me that I'm looking like a right gentleman.
He walked like a ghost in the halls up and down.
In the hospital where they wear their paper gowns.

Well my hands are strong and 10 keys wide.
But in my mother's body I was lying on my side.
My face came squished like my father's pride.
I came squished like a cartoon cat.
