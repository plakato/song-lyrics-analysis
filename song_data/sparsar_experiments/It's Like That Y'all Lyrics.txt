It's Like That Y'all Lyrics
by Sweet Tee.


Hurby, my headphones are not loud enough.
Yeah, let's do this.

Sweet Tee's in the groove, yes, I'm back on the move.
It's the thriller to kill, cause I got nothin' to lose.
I'm at the top of the heap, Hurby was lookin at me.
And oh, how they screamed.
Just wanted nothin but fun, cause I'm second to none.
And I'm here in the flesh to show how it's to be done.
So turn your speakers way up, until your ears start to pop.
And if your mom starts beefin', say, Mom, do the Whop.
Hop on the dance floor, dance to the music.
Toe-slam to my jam, you can do it.
I write rhymes, and to the world I'm given.
That's the way I'm livin'.
Leather or lace as I step in the place.
People come to say hi cause they know my face.
And you know I'm stylin, nails I'm filin'.
Standin' on stage, smilin', profilin'.
Lean, mean, breakin' out on the scene.
Me and the girls steppin' fresh outta Queens.
So if you wanna have a ball, give me a call.
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all.

Nonchalant as I flaunt the style I know you want.
Like a ghost in your mind, it's your conscience I haunt.
When I rap I bring joy to every girl, every boy.
Some think I play games cause my name is Toi.
Back to raise hell, I got records to sell.
I'm still on the top, don't you think I fell.
Never takin' a loss, weak rappers I toss.
Make no mistake, Sweet Tee is the boss.
Janet Jackson's nasty, but I'm in control.
Aretha Franklin, bow down to the new queen of soul.
Never settle for less, god is my witness.
Jog every day for physical fitness.
Climbin' higher, I'll never retire.
Rap so hot, they start three-alarm fires.
But don't be alarmed, it's just my grace and my charm.
I'm here for the good, I'll never do you no harm.
Sweet Tee's on the money, you know I'm makin' it.
I do it live, so you know I ain't fakin' it.
Five foot eight, standin' ten feet tall.
And if you ask me why, it's like that y'all.

Slam on the jam just as hard as you can.
While I rock the mic with my all-girl band.
And you know I'm clever, taken down never.
Give me a beat, and I'm a cold-blooded terror.
My voice is on wax, now you know I'm set.
Cause the better the rhyme, the more money I get.
And I hope I'm told, when my record's old.
That they all got sold, and my jam went gold.
I give it all I got, and all I got I give.
I take no shorts, that's the way I live.
Tee's on the move, and I never get moved on.
Well, I'ma live real long.
I'm the people's choice, so all the people choose me.
Keep my beeper beepin', so the fellas don't lose me.
Sly as a fox, sippin' juice on the rocks.
When I get on the roll, I can never be stopped.
When I'm good I'm good, and when I'm bad I'm better.
Keep that in mind and don't you forget-a.
I write the rhymes that make you jump off the wall.
And you wanna know why? It's like that y'all.

Cruisin' down the street in my jett-black Volvo.
Rockin to the radio playin'.
Heads all turn as I drive by.
As I wave to the fellas, all the fellas say.
Stepped on the gas, and I went to the disco.
The music's pumpin and the people screamin'.
The place is packed and people shakin their bodies.
The crowd outside is screamin'.
Jump on the stage, knuckleheads began to rampage.
They stopped short when my girl pulled the 12-guage.
Rocked anyway, cause I'm bad, and I'm bold.
Another rapper couldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole.
If you know what it is, then you know I'm a whiz.
Toes are tappin' while I'm rappin' cause I'm in showbiz.
Autographs I sign while they stand in line.
I remain number one till I'm a hundred and nine.
I play no games, and you know I ain't frontin'.
Let me know if you wanna start a little somethin'.
Why? Cause I'm a heavyweight, I go for it all.
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all.
