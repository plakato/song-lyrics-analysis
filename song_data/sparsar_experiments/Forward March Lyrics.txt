Forward March Lyrics
by Viza.

Go! Go! Go! Hit ‘em right from the start!
Go! Go! Go! Take ‘em out forward march!
Go! Go! Go! Straight aim for the heart.
Go! Go! Go! Take ‘em out forward march!

Lace ‘em up, round ‘em up, line ‘em up. Check!
Smoke ‘em up, drink ‘em up, turn it up. Check!

They wanna hate on me.
They wanna mess with me.

Help me reason.
Help me settle up the score.
Help me strengthen.
Help me break down the door.

Turn around, drive around, triple crown. Check!
Boss around, slosh around, hit the ground. Check!

They wanna hate on me.
They wanna fuck with me.

Help me reason.
Help me settle up the damn score.
Help me strengthen.
Help me break down the damn door.

Go! Go! Go! Hit ‘em right from the start!
Go! Go! Go! Take ‘em out forward march!

Go! Go! Go! Straight aim for the heart.
Go! Go! Go! Take ‘em out forward march!

Check!
