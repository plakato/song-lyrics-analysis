Alaskans Lyrics
by Volcano Choir.

Last time that I saw you.
You had me housed up on your red red rum.
Stranded in the housing.
Of our moving house and ....

We were gonna hit every port.
And every cape town.
We were gonna give a full report, of sorts.
To your mother up in kabo and her new cohort.

Damn!
Can't believe your father left his land.
The creed.
To cry:.
Rely, rely, rely, rely.
Behave, behave, behave, behave ....
Spend all of that time not wanting to.

Climbed up on your carpet.

There's a car pit in our minds were in.
Shameless and humming.
Like a violent strumming.

We were gonna hit every mark, in stark.
But the sutra didn't suit ya that long day in the park.
I'm talking about it.
Talking real love.
I wanna re-up.
On that love.

Damn.
Can't believe you left me on the lam.
To be seen.
To be scribed.
I'll tell you now that you.
Rely, rely, rely, rely.
Behave, behave, behave, behave.
Spend all of that time not wanting to.

Rely, rely, rely, rely.
Behave, behave, behave, behave.
Decide, decide, decide, decide.
Repave, repave, repave, repave.

Inside, inside, inside.
The lathe, the lathe, the lathe.

Lover won't you talk to me about the long red war.
