Beatdown (Feat. Jedi Mind Tricks & T-Ruckus) Lyrics
by Virtuoso.

Virtuoso.
Yo, I be attestin' bad you soon discover I'm the best around.
Virtuoso omnipotent medulla rule the extra crowds.
Step in battles weapon-rals give ya chest a pound.
'til ya breast is ground meat.
Pharaohs Army sound fleet.
Snatch ahold of half ya soul make, casserole.
Crack a pole on ya back and roll you in the blackest hole.
The winter brewed, enter nude Amazonian jungle warfare.
Silver back guerilla I'm covered in more hair.
Than four chairs in a barber shop.
Vocals hard as rocks and the beat's on smash.
Make ya veto, jigga weak foe.
Cause my machete unique flow fuckin' beat yo ass.
I got the key to sense or hear a deer sharp as fox.
Sound as when carver chop, galaxies and stars'll drop.
You know Virt, run with ogres who throw dirt.
Stomp ya ass 'til ya bones squirt like yogurt.
T-Ruckus.
Aiyyo rush extreme pervert, I'm undercover covert.
You need to put in work, and get ya games out my face.
Let the flames in the place, you fuckin' wid Ruck's a fatal move.
You stand in disgrace yo my brain's in outerspace.
Taste the toxic, improved reflexes like shadowboxin'.
Sternum crack, extreme force applied to ya back.
Pick ya torture that's the rack.
I'll scortch ya with the lift.
And word style I clash like,  with full clips.
Guerilla war I killed ya core.
Atilla the Hun don't want none.
I rap shit, into the floors.
Spittin' shots through ya door, and kick that bitch down.
From the bowel, where Ruck throws the mic to the ground.
In discussin' Ruck you trust, word to us.
You spittin' the shit we flush time to bust.
And crack the earth's crust with one thrust.
Nasty as shit, toxic the hazardous, analyst.

I got it locked from the 2-1 pound to.
