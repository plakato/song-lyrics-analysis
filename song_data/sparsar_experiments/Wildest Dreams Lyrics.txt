Wildest Dreams Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.


She said, Let's get out of this town.
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds.
I thought, heaven can't help me now.
Nothing lasts forever.
But this is gonna take me down.

She's so tall and handsome as hell.
She's so bad, but she does it so well.
I can see the end as it begins.
My one condition is.

Say you'll remember me.
Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset.
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again.
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams.
Your wildest dreams.

I said, No one has to know what we do.
Her hands are in my hair, her clothes are in my room.
Her voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever.
But this is getting good now.

She's so tall and handsome as hell.
She's so bad, but she does it so well.
And when we've had our very last kiss.
My last request is.

Say you'll remember me.
Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset, baby.
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again.
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams.
Your wildest dreams.

You see me in hindsight.
Tangled up with you all night.
Burning it down.
Someday when you leave me.
Bet all these memories will follow you around.
Will follow you around, 'round.

Say you'll remember me.
Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again.
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams.
Your wildest dreams.
Say you'll remember me.
Say you'll remember me.
