Higher Power Lyrics
by Boston.

Yeah, give me the power  .
And the power to change the things I can  .
I cannot change  .
Yeah, my higher power  .
Ooh, let me love you  .
God, grant me the courage to accept the things  .
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid  .
And the wisdom to know the difference  .
Turn the pages  .
Hey, my higher power  .
Hey, my higher power.
  .
It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day  .
  .
Take me back into the secrets of my mind  .
  .
Come and save me Lord  .
.
  .
Yeah, my Higher Power  .
My captain's on his way  .
Teach me how to see your vision through my eyes  .
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid  .
  .
Ooh, let me love you  .
Yeah, give me the power  .
It's the beginnin', the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day  .
Hey, my higher power  .
Hey, my higher power  .
Hey, my higher power  .
Safe embraces, I feel it comin' now  .
  .
Tell my story, let me face another day  .
Take me home to your religion for the night  .
Yeah, give me the power  .
  .
  .
  .
Hey, my Higher Power  .
Yeah, give me the power It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day  .
Let me hold you  .
Yeah!!  .
Yeah, my Higher Power  .
  .
It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day  .
Let me touch you  .
Hey, my Higher Power  .
Let me know you  .
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid  .
It's the beginning of another day  .
  .
Let me love you  .
Hey, my higher power  .
  .
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid  .
Don't let me cross the line  .
  .
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid  .
