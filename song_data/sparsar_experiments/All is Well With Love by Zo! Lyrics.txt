All is Well With Love by Zo! Lyrics
by Zo!.

The moon sits high 
As, we lay low 
Under, the sky, 
We watch it glow 
And. It feels good tonight, 
Cause, I'm by your side, 
And you're lying next me 
I feel your skin and taste. Your wine 
Cause - I am yours and you are mine. 
Everything is love. Everything is love, 
Everything is love. When I'm with you 
The moon, sits high 
As, we lay low 
Under, the sky, 
We watch it glow 
And. It feels good tonight, 
Cause, I'm by your side, 
And you're lying next me 
I, feel your skin and taste your wine 
Cause. I am yours, and you are mine, 
Everything is love, everything is love, 
Everything is love when I'm with you 
Tell me that you want me Baby 
Tell me that you need me Baby 
Tell me that you love me Baby 

Tell me that you want me Baby 
Cause. All is well with loving you 
\ -- .
