Ask Me Lyrics
by Tyler Gary.


If you ask me.
Jay STEEZ keep it bumping like acne.
You know the team.
We run it like athletes at track meets.
And ain't nobody coming pass me.
She said never let these niggas catch you slippin'.
And never give your all to the cold hearted bitches as an infant.
You've always been gifted with the rightest touch.
Might as well use them gold caps as your protection.

Life is getting real.
Things are getting crazy.
Half the girls I went to high school with are having babies.
I'm still smoking weed and trynna save for a Mercedes.
And maybe date somebody who isn't shady....
Never gave a fuck about politics.
Probably cause I'm part of a generation that's hard to fix.
White collar pricks trynna hoard all the mula Momma.
Then they ask what's wrong with my medulla oblongata, fucked up.
The only way I manage to forge a grin on my face is when I'm getting sucked up.
And when that nut busts its back to reality.
Fuck everybody on the news spittin' travesties.
The King of Dope Sofas, bow to your majesty.
Judge a man by his mind not his salary.
You can count on me like a calorie.
To lay them facts while filtering the fallacies.

If you ask me.
TG keep it bumping like acne.
You know the team.
We run it like athletes at track meets.
And ain't nobody gon' pass me.
She said never let these niggas catch you slippin'.
And never give your all to the cold hearted bitches as an infant.
You've always been gifted with a mighty touch.
Might as well use them gold guts as protection.

Have you ever thought about the future?
The kids of today are half man half computers.
I don't know what to say.
If I ever have a son.
He will play out in the sun.
Cause this new generations full of losers.
Instagram, Tumblr, Facebook abusers.
Who believe everything that they read on these screens.
How super for the media.
They just gotta type it and you'll eat it up.
Breaking news the grass is not green enough.
The sky is not blue enough.
You aren't being you enough.
When it comes to brainwaves you don't want to use too much.
You should let us think for you.
Pop ideas in your head like peek-a-boos.
That the real American thing to do.
Fuck that. I am not a Pikachu.
You cannot train me.
I do the unthinkable.
And if your really think you will... alter my beliefs.
You would have a better time sniffing queefs muhfuckaaa.

If you ask me.
Jay Steeze keep it bumping like acne.
You know the team.
We run it like athletes at track meets.
And ain't nobody coming pass me.
She said never let these niggas catch you slippin'.
And never give your all to the cold hearted bitches as an infant.
You've always been gifted with the rightest touch.
Might as well use them gold caps as your protection.

Rip STEEZ, if you ask me.
TG keep it bumping like acne.
You know the team.
We run it like athletes at track meets.
And ain't nobody gon' pass me.
She said never let these niggas catch you slippin'.
And never give your all to the cold hearted bitches as an infant.
You've always been gifted with a mighty touch.
Might as well use them gold guts as protection.
