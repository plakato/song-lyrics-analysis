Ask Me Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

I see her as a little girl hiding in her room.
She takes another bath and she sprays her momma's perfume.
To try to wipe away the scent he left behind.
But it haunts her mind.

You see she's his little rag, nothing more than just a waif.
And he's mopping up his need, she is tired and afraid.
Maybe she'll find a way through these awful years to disappear.

Ask me if I think there's a God up in the heaven.
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the heavens.
I see no mercy and no one down here's naming names.
Nobody's naming names.

Now she's looking in the mirror at a lovely woman face.
No more frightened little girl, like she's gone without a trace.
Still she leaves the light burning in the hall.
It's hard to sleep at all.

Still she crawls up in her bed acting quiet as a mouse.
Deep inside she's listening for a creaking in the house.
But noone's left to harm her, she's finally safe and sound.
There's a peace she's found.

Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the heaven.
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the heavens.
She said His mercy is bringing her life again.

Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heaven.

Where did He go in the middle of her shame.

Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heavens.

She said his mercy is bringing her life again.
She's coming to life again.

He's in the middle of her pain.
In the middle of her shame.
Mercy brings life.
He's in the middle.
Mercy in the middle.

So ask me how I know.
Ask me how I know, yeah.
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heaven.

Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heavens.

Yeah, ask me how I know.

Ask me.
Ask me.
Ask me how I know.

There's a God up in the heavens.
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the heavens.
