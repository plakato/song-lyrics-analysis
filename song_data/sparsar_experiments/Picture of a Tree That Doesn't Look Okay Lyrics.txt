Picture of a Tree That Doesn't Look Okay Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

Do you think the landlord's pissed?
We left a car parked on the lawn again.
He's looking.

The porch is still and empty.
We wrote our friends' names on the walls inside.
They're laughing.

And we know that this isn't home for long.
The posters in your bedroom speak softly.
They tell stories.

So while the weather's getting worse.
We take shelter in these walls again.
And tell stories.

So where did you live and what did you learn there?
We watch the fallen leaves turn to frozen trees.
It's been another year.
Where do the echoes from the echoes go?
Where does the water flow once it leaves our homes?

I've been searching for this.
Something that I can run away with.
It's a life changing decision.
Should I leave or try to beat this?

Where do the echoes from the echoes go?
Where does the water flow when it leaves our homes?

Live wires are like this.
They hit the streets and form a beacon.
It's a danger we've been warned.

Watching our planet grow on screens.
I spoke into the window sill.
And still forgot everything that it spoke back.

A thousand.
Frozen trees.
But still there's.
Something burning.

They are filled with everything.

Where do the pieces of our dreams recede?
Into eyes shut that are opening.

I never have ever decided what to think of all the years I spent in.
Connecticut.

I'll apologize for all the things I should have said).
So beat on the bass drum, make all the spiders run.
We threw rocks at the house and it looked back.
