Synergy Lyrics
by Russ Moshavi Chara.

I'm a motherfucking millionaire you doof.
Going city to city inside of this spoof.
Got millions of dollars and Bill Gates on my side.
I could take away your business and leave you all to die.

I got a mercedes Benz.
Got plenty damn lady friends.
It's from buying the United States out.
I got a hell of a life.
I bought my buddy his wife.
I got everything.
You know my company is the best fest.

I play Gulf with Abdullah.
I do his wife Rania.
Then i pay the mac daddy of Amman off.
Politics is what it is to ya.

I bought the whitehouse yesterday.
I left Obama on his ass.
Now he's begging in the street.
He ain't got no class.

I guess I really am a jerk, but that's how business all works.

I'm making monopoly empire boardwalks.
That hurts.
I pay Curt his insurance.
Pay Matt his assistance.
I pay Syria the cash for the fucking resistance.

Ima be watching you.
Got you in my sight.
If i decide to buy you out, there's no place to hide.
I own the media, wikipedia and every damn American pop diva.
Me and Maria have you and Wiz Khalifa.

I'll admit guys I'm cheap as hell.
But you'll only see this rapper hitting on the females.
Oh that's how it be.
Man! me and, MC.

Yo Abdullah you can keep your queen.
After all there's no animosity between you and me.
Yeah ima buy Sony and California's flowers and tree sap.
Drop you in Iraq.
Let Al Qaeda kick your ass for two hours while I take a nap.

That's how it be, taking tree sap.
Keep going all this time.
Freestyling and spitting the rhyme.
Watch me go.

Freestyle.
I feel like these companies keep buying us out.
Selling things to other countries without a doubt.
Taking oil from Iraq, all dead because of lies.
Can't believe this, can't believe my eyes.

Yeah, all these trusts and entrustment.
I can't believe this, we're going bustment.
Yeah I'm making up words now just to keep the rap going.
For all of you without a doubt.

No clout.
No pressure.
Just keep going.
And never stop ever.
I can't believe this.
South side of LA is full of fucking shit and piss.

Damn, they took the business away.
Sent them to China, for people to work on the assembly lines.
Until the end of their time.
Without a doubt, feeding them nothing but fucking shit and brine.

I was born in Chicago, that's a village in Africa.
All they had to eat was dog shit and paprika.
That's a lie I was from palistan.
Next to lebanonistan.
Blew up Paskistan with a gas can.

Yeah, you know how it be.
I'm the fucking rad ranter.
That's how it be.
Yeah, I keep saying this shit.
It's getting shitty.
Should end this rap right now.
But it ain't gonna be pretty.

While I go at it I'm gonna say.
Synergy is a bad thing for you and me today.
Why the hell it gotta be that way?
Can't we just tell them to go away for another day?

Yesterday is gone, yesterday is over.
Telling them is like fucking Red Rover.
Let Clifford come over.
Who knows who he be?
Just another stranger out in the fucking dark streets.

Going at it all of the time.
Going around spitting my fucking rhymes.
Down at clubs in Detroit and Mt. Clemens.
Where I grew up.
Damn, everything was always getting fucked.

Drive my pickup truck.
Over a tramp.
Inside of fucking Los Angeles.
Get a postage stamp.
From the president.
Like damn I want you to be my Whitehouse resident.
Playing basketball with the president.
Dumping on his delegates.
Gotta be careful, the whitehouse is delicate.

Millionaire.
Slumdog.
Whatever you call me.
I ain't got that shit anymore.
It ain't pretty.

I could say the same words again and again.
But I don't care I'm making you my fucking hen.
I make you my bitch.
I buy you out, make you my slave.
Even thought the 13th amendment says I can't, that's gay.

Oh wait, I shouldn't say that.
I shouldn't offend my own friends.
That's crap.
