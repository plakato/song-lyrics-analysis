Somebody Stole My Dog Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Somebody stole my dog.
Somebody stole my dog.
Somebody stole my dog.
You know they did.

Last night while I lay sleeping.
In my house they came a-creeping.
Somebody, somebody stole my dog.

Somebody stole my dog.
I wonder who could've stole my dog.
I wonder who could've stole my dog.
I wonder why.

I told you over and over again.
That that dog's my best friend.
Somebody, somebody stole my dog.
Yes, they did.

Somebody stole my dog.
Please, you know who could've stole my dog.
Somebody please bring my dog back to me.
I'd give anything, anything if you just, if you just.
If you, if you can, if you just, if you get get get get get get.
Get get get get get get get get, bring my dog again.

Please, please, please, I love that dog so much.
So much, so much, so much.
Please, please, please, please, please, please.
