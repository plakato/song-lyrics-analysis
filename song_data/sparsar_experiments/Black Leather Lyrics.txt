Black Leather Lyrics
by The Runaways.


Ooh.
Well, he's all geared up, walkin' down the street.
I can see the slime, drippin' down his sleeve.
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do.
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do.

Ooh.
Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone.
I can hear the boots gettin' near her home.
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do.
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do.

Scratch, scratch, he's clawing at the door.
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore.
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore.
I never should have asked for black leather.
Black leather, black leather, black leather.

You can try to hide, you know you won't get far.
You let him in, and you'll start again.
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do.
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what he's gonna do.

Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door.
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore.
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore.
I never should asked for black leather.
Black leather, black leather, black leather.
