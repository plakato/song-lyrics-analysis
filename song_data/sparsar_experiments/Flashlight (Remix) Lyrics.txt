Flashlight (Remix) Lyrics
by Syd tha Kyd.

Ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh baby.
Ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh.

My heart, it's with you now.
But do you know how to love me?
Your heart it beats for me.
I'm the only thing you got to hold onto.
My mind tells me to let you go.
But my heart said no.

My mind tells me that this is wrong.
But your love's too strong.
And now I'm caught in the middle.
You took away my flashlight.
Now I'm walking in the dark.
Thinking why'd I even stop to think.
That this could be love.
Is it too late to turn back now?
Now that I've given you my heart.
Before this whole thing falls apart.
But could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?

Slow flow.
Uh, come home with a attitude, cuz your day was stressful.
I calm your body down, and fold your legs like a pretzel.
WWF in the bed like I'm wrestle.
Cinnamon sugar sweet, Girl I just wanna get it wet so.
Submarine shift, baby you can ride my vessel.
Nipple on your nipple, can I come and get a breastful?
Honestly, I like the way you feed me.
Looking at me like a book, I like the way you read me.
Niggas wanna be me, but they can't even.
I'm committed seven days, out the week, no cheating.
I feel like Steven Spielberg, the way we film our movie.
Sit back on the chair, and watch little momma do me.
12 inches, no ruling, we share 50-50.
She tell me I'm the one, every time we gettin' busy.

Three times out the day, and we're on our second session.
Yes.

You took away my flashlight.
Now I'm walking in the dark.
Thinking why'd I even stop to think.
That this could be love.
Is it too late to turn back now?
Now that I've given you my heart.
Before this whole thing falls apart.
But could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
I'm no longer safe when you look my way.
You've become my everything.
Is this a mistake?

Baby, when you put, put that thing on me.
I just can't explain.
This is a mistake.

And I hate to be selfish, baby.
But what about me?
If you leave you take it all.

Nah, You know I wouldn't leave you, baby.
So say you'll be mine.
Maybe together we'll find.
The words that describe love.
If what we both feel inside is love.

You took away my flashlight.
Now I'm walking in the dark.
Thinking why'd I even stop.
To think that this could be love.
Is it too late to turn back?
Now that I've given you my heart.
Before this whole thing falls apart.
But could this be love, love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love, love?
Could this be love? Love, yeah.
