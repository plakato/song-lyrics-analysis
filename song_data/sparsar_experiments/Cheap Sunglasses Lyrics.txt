Cheap Sunglasses Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

When you get up in the morning and the light is hurt your head.
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed.
Is hit that streets a-runnin' and try to beat the m√°sses.
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

Spied a little thing and I followed her all night.
In a funky fine Levis and her sweater's kind of tight.
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molasses.
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

Now go out and get yourself some big black frames.
With the glass so dark they won't even know your name.
And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes.
Rhinestone shades or cheap sunglasses.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
