50 Cent &amp; Chris Brown.
Ayo, quit Captain Savin', serenadin' them hoes.
She no Juliet for no Romeo with no dough.
She report to pimpin', now back to trickin'.
She report to pimpin', nigga back to trickin'.

Hey hoe, get back to twerkin', back to workin'.
Get back to strippin', they back to tippin'.
Them stacks is fallin', they back to ballin'.
Them bottles poppin', bitch the mall is callin' us.
Quit fuckin' around, not playin' around bitch, shit is for real.
Quick makin' a stack, back makin' some mill, I mean, get us a deal.
Bitch fix us a meal, tell me how does it feel?
On the social network when they said a nigga really ain't got no chill.

50 Cent &amp; _Chris Brown_.
He think he fuckin' my bitch, nigga that bitch for rent.
He know how to treat a hoe, I mean all that money spent.
_She __says__ you a sweetheart, a sweetheart_.
Things tend to go a little different round here, we pimpin' nigga.

Had the homies come through, 400, that be the block.
Take yo shit, we going up on the Instagram.
Higher than a ceiling fan, I'm whippin' bricks in the kitchen.
I'm flying shit out the window like I was Peter Pan.
I handle my own shit, I own shit.
Alone shit, middle finger to the middle man.
Anybody that can get it when they want it.
Finger fuck bitches, she gon tell me when she cummin'.
50 in this bitch and I ain't asking him for nothin'.
That's my OG, if a nigga trippin', get to bustin'.
Mo money mean mo problems.
If your nigga got the money, we gon' rob him.
Boy I'm simply, a P.I.M.P.
And I'mma let it go 'til the clip go empty.

50 Cent &amp; Chris Brown.
He think he fuckin' my bitch, nigga that bitch for rent.
He know how to treat a hoe, I mean all that money spent.
She say you a sweetheart, a sweetheart.
Things tend to go a little different round here, we pimpin' nigga.

I'm getting big money, started going hard keep a nigga from hatin'.
Remove the white bitch, nigga Google this shit we interracial dating.
This is a new wave, I'm a.
new Wraith, my nigga sit on suede.
Like I'm Special Ed, but I ain't Special Ed, bitch I got it made.
We here to make the paper, hope you niggas on the same page.
You know boy in the hood'll have you running like Ricky from a 12 gauge.
You know my bottom bitch, I done told her how to break a nigga 12 ways.
A few tricks a day, that there keep the bill collectors away.
You hear my name on the street, circulating, you heard I'm cakin'.
These niggas try to compete, perpetratin', what's percolating?
I got game for days, ask around, they tell you I put it down.
So a hoe feel like I'm right next to her when a nigga way up town.
