This Song Lyrics
by Quarashi.

Nothing left in me to fight for.
Go with all the rest.
You know what it is inside me.
Carry me back.

This song is all I have to give now.
Nothing more to say.
Words are running out, there's no more.
Carry me back.

I, I'm tired, torn, but trying.
Now all hope lies with you.
Carry me back home again.
A new world built on all the good parts.
Words are what we are, and words are where it starts.

Nothing ever brings me home. x8.
