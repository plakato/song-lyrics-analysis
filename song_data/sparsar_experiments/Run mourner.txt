by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

Run Mourner Run.
Run Mourner Run.
Theres singing here.
Theres singing there.
I believe down in my soul.
Theres singing everywhere.
Run, mourner, run!
Lo! Says the bible.
Run, mourner, run.
Lo! Is the way.
Theres preaching here.
Theres preaching there.
I believe down in my soul.
Theres preaching everywhere.
Theres praying here.
Theres praying there.
I believe down in my soul.
Theres praying everywhere.
I know de udder world is not like dis.
