Arsenio Verse Lyrics
by Rx.

Pointin my erection in your direction.
White basil, hazel eye complexion.
Can't keep up with my unbearable detection.
Im makin money like the church collection.

These vasectomy rappers, are shootin me with blanks.
Makin these traitors, walk them planks.
Takin over rap game with iron tanks.
We comin on all sides, surround the flanks.

Im coppin my own mixtape before you buy it.
Bitch these rules, I just defy it.
Stealin money, brinks heist riot.
Play you out, at home dont try it.

A2K is blazin the track, im just a piece, like a mac.
Wield it quick, no more to gain.
Im burnin these bitches left to right like acid rain.
Your ears are scarred from lyrical pain.

Sniff the beat, like the caine.
Caught off track, lack of brain.
Fuck a bitch, call it a train.
She gettin off topic, slut gettin slain.

Im a well known product, household name.
People get killed, im to blame.
Lyrics I spit, got no shame.
Day to day, dame to dame.

Sick shit is my claim to fame.
Smack a bitch, call it cliche.
If I get famous, ill do cliche all the way.
Everyday ill make my way, seein colors, never grey.

You in trouble cause you been actin a fool.
Actin like you still in school.
I ain't your buddy, watch and drool.
Ill show you up, your wack im cruel.

Enough bars yet? I dont think so.
Campin on the beat, spittin eskimo.
Rx talkin, off his rock you know.
5degreesOff is a growin crop so...

I dont spit on this track, I chew beats.
Call me the TRx of Song Ft.â€˜s.
Featuring me, im elite.
Space them syllables out, And take a quick seat.
