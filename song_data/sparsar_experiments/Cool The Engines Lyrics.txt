Cool The Engines Lyrics
by Boston.


Now I like taking off.
Don't like burning out.
Every time you turn it on.
Makes me want to shout.
We keep getting hotter.
Moving way too fast.
If we don't slow this fire down.
We're not going to last.

Cool the engines.
Red line's getting near.
Cool the engines.
Better take it out of gear.

I'm no fool.
I'm going to keep it cool.
And take it day by day.
We won't know where we might go.
Until we take it all the way.

Take me for a ride.
Take me all the way.
Take me where I've never been.
Someplace I can stay.
Don't get yourself too hot.
Don't get yourself too high.
If we don't take it easy now.
We can kiss it all goodbye.

Cool the engines.
Slow this rocket down.
Cool the engines.
Why don't you take a look around.

I'm no fool, going to keep it cool.
Take it day by day.
We won't know where we might go.
Until we take it all the way.

Cool the engines.
Cool the engines.
Going over the line.
Going off the dial.
Running out of time.
And it's getting wild.
Got flashing lights.
Going round and round.
Until we get it right.
Better cool it down.
Better cool it down.

Cool the engines.

And now we're on our way.
No need to hurry just to get from day to day.
And I, oooh, I know.
We don't have to run that hard to get where we can go.

Cool the engines.
Cool the engines down.
Cool the engines.
Cool the engines down.
