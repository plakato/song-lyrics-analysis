Academic Probation Freestyle (Prod. KaoticJourney) Lyrics
by TyAnak.


Academic Probation.
Academic Probation.
We coming to yo' location.
And making our mark quotation.
And ma just want me to turn right No GPS navigation.
And quit with all the rapping and focus on education.
But aye I rap mama.
It ain't no need to debate.
Girls heard she love me.
Now they racing like a relay.
And for all my orginal fans I'm sorry for the delay.
I was busy making moves living my life like its a screenplay.
Shout Out Destiny Essence Lanye Jabria and Derrick.
Trevon Reggie and Kayla get love and most of the Credit.

Stacking cheese bread and lettuce and sandwiches ain't our preference.
Okay i go macadamians.
Weighin' money like Damian.
Going straight at yo' cranium.
So stay out of my Radius.
All work no play this is not a gymnasium.
Boy i ball hard welcome to my stadium.
LC &amp; Yung Ty.
V-neck and some Levis.
She be blowin' up my phone but she dont get no reply.
Kickin' it like FIFA.
Cheese and Lettuce no caesar.
Cause all i need is cheese and bread and i ain't making pizza.
