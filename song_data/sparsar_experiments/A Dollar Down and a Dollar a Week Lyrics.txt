A Dollar Down and a Dollar a Week Lyrics
by Woody Guthrie.

Ade Olay E-E.
Ade Olay E-E.
E-E-E-E-E.

A friend of mine bought an automobile.
At a dollar down and a dollar a week.
Every time he turned the wheel.
It was a dollar down and a dollar a week.

He went riding down the road.
Pinched this girl upon her cheek.
Speed cop took him to the judge.
He got a dollar down and a dollar a week.

Sixty days he laid in jail.
At a dollar down and a dollar a week.
Another man was a lovin' his gal.
At a dollar down and a dollar a week.

When he got out he shot the man.
And laid him in the graveyard six feet deep.
And when he bought the graveyard spot.
It was a dollar down and a dollar a week.

Ade olay E-E.
Ade olay E-E.
Ade olay E-E.
E-E-E-E-E.
