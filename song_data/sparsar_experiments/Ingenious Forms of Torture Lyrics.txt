Ingenious Forms of Torture Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

What ingenious forms of torture does Beezlebub have for me?
Pierced and punctured?
Poked and prodded?
By the swords of several armies?
Drag me screaming to the guillotine.
Hold my breath till it's severed clean.

Dulled and quartered?
Sliced and severed?
Cut my heart out?
Make me eat it?
Tar and feathered?
Burnt to crisp or drowned then strapped down to the garret?

Sharpen Objects.
Deep Incisions.
Strangled by snakes.
Choked by serpents.
Blood will boil.
Cooked in oil.
Until supple flesh falls from bone.

Sharpen Objects.
Deep Incisions.
Strangled by snakes.
Choked by serpents.
Blood will boil.
Cooked in oil.
Until supple flesh falls from bone.

Water torture?
Locked in darkness?
Let the rats feed on my body?
Prick my finger?
Pin my eyelids?
Stretch me on the rack 'till i snap?
Drag me screaming to the hanging tree.
Blindfold on so i dont have to see.

Set on fire?
In a pyre?
Burn me for thy sins committed?
Dastardly deeds.
Wicked workings.
Will always come back to haunt me.

Sharpen Objects.
Deep Incisions.
Strangled by snakes.
Choked by serpents.
Blood will boil.
Cooked in oil.
Until supple flesh falls from bone.

Sharpen Objects.
Deep Incisions.
Strangled by snakes.
Choked by serpents.
Blood will boil.
Cooked in oil.
Until supple flesh falls from bone.
