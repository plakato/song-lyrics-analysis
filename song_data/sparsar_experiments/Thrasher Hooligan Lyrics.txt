Thrasher Hooligan Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


I'm all fucked up, Thrasher Hooligan causing ruckus.
On ya street smoking weed, yelling at whores and skateboarding.
With Cory lurking, see the police, we murking.
Cause some bitch called the pigs again, I'm getting addicted to this.
So I'ma be a dick, take a piss.
Piss all over these shits in my toilet.
My shit list, my wick is almost dismissed.
Wicked on this diss when I spit it like I'm pissed.
Serious when I say I'll leave you delirious like conspiracies on these.
pyramids.
You hearing this? This is only the first damn period that I appeared in this.
Picture with all these leary kids all mysterious.
'Till I pry them apart with maniacal art.
Trying to start a riot so I can fuck you fuckers up with bare palms.
I don't need to bear arms, I swear dog.

On the loose.
Tie the noose.
Fuck it up.
Don't give a fuck.

All you motherfuckers out of luck, I'm bout to buck.
I've gone nuts, it's come.
Insanity finally finding me.
Ty-ing me down, I'm down for the count.
My old self at least, he's gone to hell in peace and pieces.
That I feasted on like I've been cannibalized and beasted.
A savage ravaging, attacking pacifists like a pathogen.
So pass them in so I can pack them in my pack then drag them in.
I'm the genocide of many lives on a petty try.
So say goodbye, it's beddy-bye time.
Motherfucker I am Ty and I'm a Thrasher Hooligan.

Woah.
Oh.

If there's an afterlife, I wonder what it's like time and time again.
Time and time again these questions pop into my mind.
And then I wonder about if this is all lie time and time again.
Time and time again this question pops into my mind.
