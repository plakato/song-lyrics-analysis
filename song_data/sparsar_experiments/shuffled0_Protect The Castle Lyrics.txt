Protect The Castle Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.

But I think that was the first chance at understanding myself.
I was barely getting meals and my parents borrowed from me.
Manage writing mechanics to my advantage and stay poised.
The way I tie lines together superbly with perfect timing.
Rebuttals for the battle, you better dead it on the double.
I would say and engrave and pen as I'd rave and rant to myself.
I would lay awake in bed and would ponder sorrowfully.
Stranded and unbranded with a couple grand and my health.
Others are underhanded I'm outright demanding my wealth.
I would have given anything to just not replay it again.
I'm heroin in a pill, Deniro when in a film.
Unorthodocks.
But still keep a place to bail in Mesa and Scottsdale.
While slaying these hot beats and praying he got bail.
We just keep on bubbling while you wonder whats under us?
Ain't no man for no manners romantic fanatic playboy.
Or better yet, every second and that's why this time it's printed.
Like what you expect? Hit the deck and protect the castle.
Hustle from sun to dusk, buster blunders met with a Blunderbuss.
Manic from organic, allegory and grammar's play toys.
Not chasing no hot tail, I'm lacing these pot scales.
Ain't here to win or appeal or in inherently get a mil'.
If they saying he not real, I don't hear em and never will.
The last gram bandit standing, hand to hand with the stealth.
Docks is back in effect, catching wreck with no hassle.
You ain't ready for a tussle buddy, let alone a struggle.
I'm such a wondrous wordsmith when I'm rhyming.
Unearth a diamond a minute every time that I'm in it.
In your nose-bleed seats when you shout and cuss at my shows.
About what tomorrow would be and what today had just been.
Rhyme styles infinite, invented to bust your nose.

You're just dust and it blows, while I'm blazing a trail.
