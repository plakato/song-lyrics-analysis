All The Money Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


I got all the fuckin' money in the world right now.
So I'm all up on yo girl right now.
All this fuckin' money don't know how to spend it.
Fuck it my team winnin' so I throw a couple millions.

X2.
Said that Maybach I'm in it.
Credit card no limit.
Bad bitches be grinnin'.
Fuck yo ho, we winnin'.

Rolex on my wrist, 40 on my hip.
50 round my neck, 60 hoes on my dick.
We all got Benz, you ain't fuckin' with my clique.

12 our flights so you know I'm takin' trips.
Rich forever like I ain't never goin' broke.
Billion dollar bitch that you'll never get to know.
Came from nothin', straigt up out the O.

Million on my mind, man you know this kid go.
Maybach I'm in it, you could call that livin'.
Credit card no limit, I just bought out True Religion.
My whole team winnin' so you know we all on.
Just bought a whole street, my money still on.

Bought a new ? gave the keys to moms.
G5 jets, takin' trips to Mars.
What I'mma do with all these cars?
I don't know, I'm on one.

Get money on deck.
B-bitch I'm only 21.
You better ask about me.
Don't fuck with too many fake hoes.
So bitch get the fuck from 'round me.

I parked the all black Phantom, at the all white Mansion.
Your hoes stay be active.
All them hoes is ratchet.
Fuck the law enforcement!
I'm looking for endorcement!

Brand new Lamborghini, bitch I'm ridin' in them horses.
Money talk to the ceiling, your must have a shortage.
Shoes $1500, and yo ass can't afford it!

I'm always countin' money, said I always got a profit.
If I ever went broke, I'd be runnin' through your pockets.
I'm a millionaire, you could call me a rich kid.
Buy new whip every month cos bitch I'm on my rich shit.
Girl you can not fuck with me unless you is a rich chick.
I'm on my Dave Chapelle shit.
I'm rich bitch!
