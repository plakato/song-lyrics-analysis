Beautifully Wonderful Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


Life is so beautiful.
But death is so wonderful.

But I sit with a brain full of sick.
Knowin' death comin', not runnin', this shit is tough as it gets.
I could just sit back and pass, my life is just movin' too fast.
And before you know it I'll be dead and gone, better follow it.
They said I wouldn't make it to twenty.
Said I wouldn't have bitches but bitch, I got plenty.
They sayin' quit fuckin' hoes, you got too many.
Kids but I'm lovin' to run in a bitch with no jimmy.
Finna hit 'em when impossible, I could be the one on Mars.
I feel like I do belong up in the stars.
Always been livin' my life on the edge.
But I promise this ain't the end, do not break out the cigars.
I'm mentally scarred like I was ?
Don't get caught up with 'he said she said'.
But I keep an eye out for the police and bitch niggas.
Put 'em up on a list to eradicate, I can just fuckin' decapitate.
Most of you feel like you had to hate this nigga.
Sick nigga, but I'm off in a different zone.
I be on levels you only see up in your dreams.
I can get mad at you, come back, call homies and clack at you, thought you was.
gon' make it home till we came and put two in your spleen.
Know what I mean?
Death is so beautiful, life is so easy.
Spend half my life full of alcohol feelin' so queasy.
Pull up and fill up the Pinto with gas, I'm really not thinkin' you'll last.
It's time for the livin' like George and Weezie, believe me!

Wonderful by the way that we die.
But I'm lost with a vision, just wishin' that we multiply.
But I'm knowin' my wishes will fall on deaf ears, my fear.
Is nobody up in my funeral, tears fallin' out of their eye.
Sunshine.
But nigga, they might take you up under the moonlight.
It's funny how I can sit back and make one rhyme.
And all of a sudden I'm havin' a good night.
You niggas is trippin', I'm 5150.
But if I don't hit you with words, nigga....
Then I'mma be forced to hit you with some other shit.
It's nothin' for me to sit back and get perv' with ya.
Smile in your face, kill you off then you're up in a gutter ditch.
I'm on a mothership, pushin' through different dimensions.
Repentance my binges, malicious, so vicious I was on the daily.
Makin' me take my time, fall back on shit that would.
Get you hemmed up, I don't get how you go when you.
Knowin' I'm sicker than rabies.
And for the niggas that be thinkin' they be with it.
And they really wanna be around the wicked.
Don't be kiddin' when I tell 'em I'mma hit 'em.
With the Voodoo....
Obvious I'm sicker than the people that you listen to.
I hit it with the venom, I be givin' you.
A pushin' to a limit, nigga, they ain't never been to.
How do you do?
Death is so beautiful, life is so easy.
Spend half my life full of alcohol feelin' so queasy.
Pull up and fill up the Pinto with gas, I'm really not thinkin' you'll last.
It's time for the livin' like George and Weezie, believe me!
