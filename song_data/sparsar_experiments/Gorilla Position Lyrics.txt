Gorilla Position Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.

I ain't even gon' wait on this one.

None.
Got this habit quite as impeccable.
With the incredible dexterous I'm flexin on these lexin hoes.
So let them know they time is getting closer.
They should go and plaxico they selves before I let em go.
They asking where his lettuce go.
I needed to get some head.
Niggas been tryna get some blow.
But a nigga had to move that to get some bread.
Them local niggas ain't fuckin wit me better go get the Feds.
2012 B.C. check the timeline all I'm really tryna do is get a check.
I'mma get respect for my one twos.
Anybody disrespects get a one two.
I ain't lost a battle yet you ain't won two.
But you wanna come and check nigga you get one too.
Mayweather counter punch but I ain't running from shit.
I'm runnin this shit 300 throwin one at ya kliq.
Drop hits web sling em peter park it.
Been did it for the money.
Now I do it to get Olivia Munn knees on my carpet.
What you you talkin.
My swagger out the orbit.
Word to martian gang the spartan gang is gon retarded.
They talkin bout pound 4 pound bar 4 bar I'm the hardest.
They talkin bout songs I paint portraits I'm an artist.
I say Beauty on the beat, the tracks a beauty from the beast.
On active duty pack the tooly blast a whoodie at the beat.
Sharpshooter I be ret on them ciggas smoke em.
Hope is all but gone I'm a T-Rex to you tiggers.
Corvette to siclists, cyclists.
Kratos flow Rap god of war but the flow is righteous.
Bite this and fuck around and chip a tooth.
Paint the track red but the pictures blue.
What?
You forgot you was fuckin with the militious crew.
Split ya chick in two and bring you back half.
Try to front and catch a backlash.
I'm a boss y'all lucky y'all don't get fired for that back sass.
Ol' sassy nigga wanna act like you charged up but you a gassy nigga.
I'm classy nigga, smooth as a baby ass.
What I look fuckin with a ashy nigga.
Y'all antsy niggas, I'm chillin hard.
My fancy is tom clancy nigga.
Rainbow 6 my aim don't slip.
I bang at yo dynasty nigga.
Franchise I am that, flow flame throw spit anthrax.
Steve Francis couldn't slam this know the fuck who I am jack.
YM you tried him yo story need a violin.
Ma cryin fam flying in and I ain't dialed in.
Line em up I make corpses then I pile them.
Annilhated red spotted pavements the street got psoriasis.
Probably shouldn't aim at a prodigy.
I aim at em And dot the T make him cross his eyes.
Whenever I drop this shit its apocalypse you shoulda bought supplies.
Filet the whole block a nigga shoulda brought some fries.
Now they wonder why the hell he even make this beat.
When we just turn around and say he ate this beat.
Bar 6 rappers said man he gon rape this beat.
46 them niggas probably finna hate this beat.
The focus of niggas tryna make ends meet.
Mothafuckas whose families ain't even ate this week.
Even niggas who yap about how I ain't this street.
My hunger to lyrically puncture niggas makes this street boy.
This moth to the flame I'm hotter then a furnace.
My destiny in this nation is based in what I determine.
Face to face with some coke or something laced with a burning mace.
I'm burning ya place and replacing your crib with a bird estates.
You heard the great more hustle than Charlie in his prime.
300 horses on my brain stricken with audi at the mind.
Sick and retarded on the rhyme loud addict on 4/4 time.
Yours homage a recorded slumber party thats full of mimes.
And even with that last line being a bit off.
This song by your favorite rappers gonna get bit off.
Hope he don't bite off too much more than he can chew.
But shit if this his competition ain't much more that he can do.
