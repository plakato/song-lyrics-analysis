How country feels - the voice performance Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

You were raised on an asphalt farm.
Ain't never heard a rooster crow.
Never walked barefoot by a river.
Felt the mud up between your toes.

You never rolled in the hay.
You never thrown it in four wheel.
Climb up on here girl.
Let me show you how country feels.

Let your hair down, hair down.
Get you some of this laid on back.
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off.
Get you some of this slow down fast.
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills.
Let me show you how country feels.

You ever watched the sun go down.
From the bed of a pickup truck.
Ever been so into somebody.
You're still lying there when it comes back up.

Girl what do you say?
Cut a path through that cornfield.
Park down by the water.
Let me show you how country feels.

Let your hair down, hair down.
Get you some of this laid on back.
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off.
Get you some of this slow down fast.
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills.
Let me show you how country feels.

Let your hair down.
Get you some of this laid on back.
Kick your shoes off.

Let your hair down, hair down.
Get you some of this laid on back.
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off.
Get you some of this slow down fast.
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills.
Let me show you how country feels.
Country feels.
