36 oz Lyrics
by Yung La.


36 O's.
28's Whoa.
Neck On Froze.
Wrists On Cold.
Swag Like Damn.
Straight Drop Yams.
Pockets On Ham.
Meatball Lamb.

Pull Up 08 Meatball Lamb.
Offsets Inside Sunset Tan.
Big Stupid Bank Rolls Pockets On Ham.
Yung LA Got Them Hoes Like God Damn.
It's Them Straight Drop Boys, Bitch We Got Yams.
Put Some Extra On It For You, Boy We Got Grams.
What It Do Dog, What It Do Dog.
Made 10 Grand At My Show And Blew It At The Mall.
Yung LA Ball, Yung LA Stunting.
Shawty Getting To The Money Nigga Like What.
Whips Like Uh, Tips Like Uh.
50.Cal Extended Clip Nigga Like Uh.

36 O's 36 O's.
All White All White, Like Some Tip Toes.
Foreign Cars My Boy, That's How We Roll.
I'm Sub-Zero, My Whole Body Froze.
Choppin O's In The Kitchen.
Know What I'm Talking About.
My Niggas Pop Bottles, Make Girls Swallow.
My Niggas Tote Choppers When It's Crunch Time.
Come Out The Pot Straight Drop, Lunch Time.
Wrist On Froze, Think It's A Game.
The Biggest Bracelet In The Game.
Put That On Everything.
Mama Taught Me But I Never Heard A Word, Serving Them Birds.
But No More Stalling, We Balling.

Yung L.A.:.
36 O's, Thats A Damn Whole.
Northpole Diamonds, Got My Neck Froze.
Swag Like Oh, Plus My Wrists Cold.
28's Got Them Groupie Ho's Like Whoa.
Brand New Clothes, Brand New Dro.
Straight Drop Yams, Brand New Shows.
It's A New Year, It's A New Day.
Same Old Haters, Brand New Cake.
Louie Got Next, Pockets Like Yes.
Ears On Flex, Yea We On X.
Boy U Geeked Up, Bitch I Might Be.
100,000 Worth Of Jewelry, I'm So Icy.
