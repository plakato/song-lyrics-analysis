ColourBlind Lyrics
by Queen of Hearts.


Colourblind, I only see you.
Black and white.
My heart is see-through.
Shimmering in my cocoon.
I look through damaged eyes.
At streets and faces.
Memories I have erased.
And time goes by, away, from you.

Walk through the night in search of ?
Lost in the place, no words to say.
Each time it starts to melt away.
I'm scared to feel again.
Is there a light out off the ?
A remedy that could ease my pain.
Each time it starts to melt away.
You're near and darkness fades.

Monochrome that I was used to.
Colours change when I'm beneath you.
My skin glows, my veins turn blue.
Like a kaleidoscope.
I walk the darkness.
Float away into the distance.
Catch my breath, but not too soon.

I'm drowning, I'm drowning.
I'm drowning in you.
Drowning in you, oh.

This love is my shelter, I'm colourblind.
I'm searching for answers I'll never find.
