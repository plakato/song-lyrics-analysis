Damn Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


Tyler, this is your conscious speaking 
This is your conscious speaking 
Your mind taking over 
Ready 
 
Green light, then I'm ashing, blunts 
As. I pull out the ass then bust, crack nuts 
Without a nutcracker or the cracker on the front 
Anal. I am and have been since day one 
I get excited for blood. I salivate at the sight of it. 
Katrina caused the flood and yeah. I mean a bitch 
So, don't take it as a pun, 
And, I'm on some so run. The ruckus has begun 
I'm running with full clips and hatchets on the belt. 
Attacking like I'm hell, taking ratchets out then bail 
For, the genocide of faggots like cigarette smell 
, No red everywhere, wouldn't dare leave it pale. 
Mama fuck you! You lost your son as soon as Robert fucked, you 
, And if that's not his name, I don't know what the fuck is 
But. If I see him I'ma kill him, you know where I live. You punk, bitch, 
Come, see me and I mean it. I'M evil looks can be deceiving 
Until. You see me closing in at full speed with a meat cleaver 
Breathing Ether cause these fucking dealers 
Keep on sprinkling speed up in my reefer 
Wow. What the fuck Try me again and show me your four-leaf-luck 
, You fucking leprechaun. Getting stomped on 
Got a cocked one in my palm 
Ready to pop pop, like Islamics on Americans, 
With AK-47's, sending them to Heaven or Hell 
Whatever, you repping, you going to end in 
So hope on no one, you, depending 
God dammit. Why is this room spinning? I'M off some Angry Orchard: 
Got, some more mushrooms, kicking in like SWAT Team, 
I win the lottery, Infinite cop, green 
No, copped pleas, so cop, please 
Motherfuck the Five-O Fuzz 
Give, my dick back before I bust in your cunt 
Now. Go ahead, latch the restraints again 
I'm in a room with pads, lock, ankle chains to bed damn
