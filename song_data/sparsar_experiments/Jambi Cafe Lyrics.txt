Jambi Cafe Lyrics
by The Uncluded.

Kimya Dawson 
I wish that your headaches would subside my friend 
And that your healing isn't just a case of double contact. Lens 
I've got my name down for table at the Jambi Cafe 
So I can Meka Leka Hiney Ho all of your pain away, 
And. I am outside D's Variety.
