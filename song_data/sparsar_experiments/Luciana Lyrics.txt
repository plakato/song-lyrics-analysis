Luciana Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Oh lord is it what we really want?
I fear the bones inside your body.
I feel them grow.

Oh lord there's a terror in the dark.
I fear there's nothing in our love.
I feel it grow.

In your limbs and arms and bones.
I know that we're strong.
Thinking What's the harm?

There's a fire in my chest.
It will extinguish when you're dead.
It's you I love to hold.
Before the bones they slowly grow.

Oh lord is it what we really want?
I fear the bones inside your body.
I feel them grow.

Oh lord there's a terror in the dark.
I fear there's nothing in our love.
I feel it grow.

In your limbs and arms and bones.
I know that we're strong.
Thinking What's the harm?

And I heard you'll grow old.
Your muscles turn to bones.
Trapped in a pretty pose.
And in your family home.
I dreamt of our love alone.
And singing to just one.
It's you I love to hold.
Before the bones crush your throat.
