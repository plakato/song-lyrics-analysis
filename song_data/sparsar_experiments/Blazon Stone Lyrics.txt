Blazon Stone Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Like an hawk-eyed eagle, we're cruising on our raid.
Our dogged pride will never fade.
Born-free we're still sailing the seven stormy seas.
No-one will force us to our knees.

Stand tight, we'll fight the fear and pain.
United force.
Blazon stone, power and hope to the slave.
Blazon stone, a mascot to the tortured.
Blazon stone.

Break the chains of torment.
Madness causing pain.
Can't be the fate that rules the game.
Corruption, hate and treason the evil we must fight.
United we will stand the night.

Stand tight, we'll fight the fear and pain.
United force.
Blazon stone, power and hope to the slave.
Blazon stone, suppression, we'll send to the grave.
Blazon stone, we spit into the face of death.
Blazon stone, a mascot to the tortured.
Blazon stone.

They demonize our pride, blood on blood, we can't submit.
We battle side by side, like a pounding ram that hit their head.
Their man-o-war shall burn.
Mr. Mortis reaps his seed the point of no return.
Slanderous lies we will defeat.

Stand tight we'll fight the fear and pain.
United force.
Blazon stone, power and hope to the slave.
Blazon stone, suppression we send to it's grave.
Blazon stone, we spit in the face of death.
Blazon stone, a mascot to the tortured.
Blazon stone.
