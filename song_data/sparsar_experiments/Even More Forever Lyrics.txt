Even More Forever Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

Are you awake yet?
Cause if there's a part of you that's working.
There's a part of you that hasn't sobered up.
In someone's living room.
I've only heard the coffee maker.
Someone's car starting out there on the lawn.
We haven't seen the sunrise in twenty seven years.
We've been waiting; cornered, like we're animals.
In abandoned living rooms.
We don't know what we can have.
And what is saved for someone else who has a key.

Are you asleep yet?
You can tell my ears aren't burning all the quiet names made up to make us.
laugh.
Find us an apartment with enough outlets for all of us.
Where we won't wake up your kid or pets or dad.
This isn't eating.
We count dollar menu hunger as something that isn't cold that we can eat.
We aren't broke yet.
But have to find a space between our bodies.
Find our minds and walk in off the street.

We're building our own caskets while our homes fall apart.
Tires tracking on your back.
Can't go home long enough.

Can I come home yet?
The jokes are only jokes, and every liar wants his own set of new eyes.
Can I just leave again?
I kept my promises and all I did was read about the end of it on the news.
