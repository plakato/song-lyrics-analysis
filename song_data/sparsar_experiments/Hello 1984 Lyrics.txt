Hello 1984 Lyrics
by ZSK.

Welcome to a life where you got nothing to hide.
Count the hours; tell your nightmares -good bye-.
It is just to help those innocent people.
So scared of everything unknown.
A place so sterile, fancy walls and shiny windows.
The surfcase is clean, but rotten to the core.
This is the price you pay.
For your own liberty.
And we will trust in what you say.
But we can't be locked away.
Dumb and bound, you won't silence us.
Fuck your brilliant achievements.
We will never be safe behind those faceless gates.

You can take away our rights, but not erase the thougts inside.

Welcome to the world of a thousand eyes watching you.
Just show us your plastic card and step right through.
Hear the sound of justice for the supremacist race.
No matter who the fuck yor are you cannot escape.
Don't you see the terrorist? Burning down the place you live at.
It is just us or them. Now we end like this.
This is the price you pay.
For your own liberty.
And we will trust in what you say.
But we can't be locked away.
Dumb and bound, you won't silence us.
Fuck your brilliant achievements.
We will never be safe behind those faceless gates.

You can take away our rights, but not erase the thougts inside.
