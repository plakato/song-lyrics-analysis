Act a Fool Lyrics
by Yung Ralph.


I act a fool when it come to you, baby.
Baby bring out the tool Imma let.
it loose, baby.
Tryna rob you get smoked.
For the ganja, I choke.
Murder she wrote.
Put his name on a shirt.

Yung Ralph.
I'm still lookin like money.
They know I stay fresh to death.
So many bags when I walk out to the mall.
I might just need some help.
Staring at your body.
Looking at your body.
Baby you the hottest.
Baby girl you got it.

I'm about to be straight up on you baby.
These bitches just be hating.
But they don't have jewel baby.
Keep designer on you.
Versace, Jimmy Chu.
Christian Lou be the shoe.
These bitches can't fuck with you.
Jugging a jug with my nigga ?
Car fifity bands I was barely awaiting.
I called my bitch told her I'm on the way.
Look up to the top told her I'm on my way.
We finna fuck up some commas today.
We finna fuck up some ?
Listen to what my nigga Fetty Wap got to say.

I act a fool when it come to you, baby.
Aye bring out the tool Imma let.
it loose, baby.
Tryna rob get smoked.
For the ganja, I choke.
Murder she wrote.
Put his name on a shirt.

Fetty Wap.
I act a foot.
Only for you.
Buy chanel bag and shoes.
Yeah, buy you a coupe.
Baby, Imma keep it true.
A lot of bitches on me, but they ain't you, baby.
You know how I do, baby.
Welcome to the zoo, baby.
I want you to my self.
Know nothing, not even my crew, baby.
Tell nobody else, you know how we do, baby.
You the one that I want.
Girl, you're perfect.
And every time I come 'round, it's perfect.
And if that nigga act up.
He can get it.
Tell him Get his racks up, his pockets skinny.
My money hitting front flips.
I get plenty.
If I'm a baby.
I'll hit him with the semi.

I act a fool when it come to you, baby.
Baby, I'm a zoo, Imma let it loose, baby.
Tryna rob get smoked.
For the ganja, I choke.
Murder she wrote.
Put his name on a shirt.
