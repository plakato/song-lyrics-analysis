Bust Ya Gunz Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


WHOO! Yeah yeah.
It's showtime! Yeah.
Y'all know who it is!
I'mma get it poppin like I'm used to.

Do y'all niggas bust ya guns?
Do y'all fuck 'em 'til they cum?
Do y'all niggas bust ya guns?
Do y'all fuck 'em 'til they cum?
I make 'em all say.
OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH.
OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH.

Be in the scene, I'm makin that cream.
Them haters always say What the hell does that mean?
I'm comin through your block, got somethin mean.
The Ferrari pink, it blings.
Yep, I got suede in my dash.
I got your chick ready to kiss my ass.
I go to the club man, it's no cash.
That black card make them chicks move FAHST.
Can you hear me now? Can you see me now?
I throw on my jeans tucked then it's out now.
T.I. made them suckas +Bring it Out+ now.
The Ruff Ryders start it, now just shout it!

Man... now engine engine, number 9.
You talkin crazy, you lose your mind.
And if that chucker wanna throw that stack.
Well pick it up, HEY, pick it up - you don't know me.
But Kanye know my name; Timbo, know my name.
Pharrell, know my name; Scotty, know my name.
Came in the game at 16 and changed the game up.
C-Came in the game at 16 and changed the game up.
Kicks, snares, change the beat game.
C-Cali like Big said, and Big did.
I hope nobody got offended what I said.
You wanna act crazy I aim for your head {*BLAM*}.

Swizz Beatz.
I got a special guest for y'all.
He go by the name of Drag dash, get 'em man!

Guess who's back in your buildin ya big pimpin.
Drag-dash-On, now come on, look two childrens.
It's Drag dash BITCH, Mr. Backdraft BITCH.
Bust a slug like I blub, blap-blap BITCH.
Bitches know, niggas love the way my flow SWITCH.
Scratch my twinkles, tingle make a nigga ITCH.
I ain't gotta tell you how I spit propane.
I'm at the gun range cause I ain't got no aim.
Get at you rappers spit the stank in yo' lane.
My shit been clappin since Don did The Soul Train.
I'm back like when baking soda do cocaine.
Drag to the dash, I'm in the hood like lo mein.
