Bust Ya Gunz Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


Whoo Yeah yeah, 
It's, showtime, Yeah 
Y'all, know who it is 
I'mma get it poppin like I'm used to 
 
Do y'all niggas bust ya, guns, 
Do y'all fuck'em'til. They cum 
Do, y'all, niggas, bust ya, guns, 
Do y'all fuck'em'til, they cum 
I, make'em, all say: 
OH-OHH OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH, 
OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH, 
 
Be in the scene. I'M makin that cream 
Them haters always say What the hell does that mean. 
I'M comin through your block, got somethin mean 
The Ferrari, pink it blings 
Yep. I got suede in my dash. 
I got your chick ready to kiss my ass 
I go to the club man. It'S no cash 
That black card make them chicks, move FAHST! 
Can! You hear me now. Can you see me now 
I throw on my jeans tucked then it's out now 
T.I. made them suckas, Bring it Out now: 
The, Ruff Ryders start it now, just shout it !
 
Man ... now engine engine number 9, 
You talkin crazy. You lose your mind 
And. If that chucker wan na throw that stack, 
Well pick it up, HEY pick it up. You don't know me. 
But Kanye know my name.
