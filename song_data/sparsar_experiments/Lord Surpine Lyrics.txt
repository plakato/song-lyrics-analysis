Lord Surpine Lyrics
by Yung Neptune (AKA YUNG JZ7).

The Plaid Alladin.
Wish girls didn't beat me in madden.
Wish the beaten memories were recedin into.
Satin, and satan's cushions, kushin.
Lovin mcluvin mcgangbang her.
Belch her up for air.

I'm not aware, I'm the tortoise.
Slow down, buddhist.
Kid cudi: cutest.
SHut up Im stupid.

Ruthless; chew tits.
Pulpy pie carver.
Call me aaron carter.
She hand me herself in garters.
I beckon to come and slaughter.

Laughter is my medicine.
Drugs , acetaminophen.
Fully loaded leanin then.

Popping drugs, i'm a soul to demon them.

Demonize, recognize my biggie will hypnotize.
The lady's thighs.
Spread wide and dive.

Tutorial she touch the tip.
In overalls un-snap snip.
Rice krispies catch site.
Of nip slip titties. rhyme's.
Grit witty. brain bent.
Silly. I embrace faces to chase them.

But really wanna kill me.
