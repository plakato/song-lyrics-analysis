Breathe (Sha La La) Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


Three bedroom house, six live inside it.
Queueing up for the bathroom is a hype ting.
Che, staring out the window.
All you see is rain, what's a little bit of lightning?
Chilling in the ends till police show up.
If one makes a joke then they get shown up.
And round here your friends are your family.
If Dad ain't around then the ends grow dust.
These are the times that you feel most neglected.
Cause Mum just sends you to the shock to get electric.
And deep down you didn't wanna go.
But if you ever let her know, you'll be living on your own.
And right now you're living on the road.
But it's nice to know that you've got the choice of going home.
It's weird cause it's busy in the pitch.
But we still can't catch who's pissing in the lift.

I'm like just give it a rest man, I know best man, please.

The police are still scattered, preaching, I've had it like please.

Cause all the words I'm hearing got my eardrums burning like please.

If you've got nothing good to say then just keep quiet, breathe.

Living paranoid, that's what the game does.
Sitting there talking, now the world is against ya.
And now you're scared of what changed us.
Why would we leave the estate? It created us.
Mum keeps saying I should go and get a job.
So that's the reason that we don't get along.
Saying she's gonna send me to live with my dad.
Everyone's an influence and they're leading me on.
But she don't understand that I'm my own man.
I can make me a grand or make her a gran.
Only thing changed is the number of the day.
So without sellotape I'mma stick to the plan.
Cause it's the only way I know how to live.
And don't claim that you know how it is.
Cause if you ever walked one mile in my shoes.
You'd be slipping in the ends like you need better grip.

Growing up we were ever so skint.
That made it so hard tryna be the Fresh Prince.
I stopped combing my hair on purpose.
Just so my mum would make me get a fresh trim.
Looking in the mirror while I'm getting out the chair.
Mumbling to myself what the fuck you done here?
But I didn't even say it cause I know I've gotta pay him.
Cuh when you're growing up I know nothing makes sense.
Odd trim, hoodie up, tryna chat up girls.
She said I've chatted up the rest of the world.
Said I'd sent texts when I never had credit.
The truth is I'd done it on free voicemail.
I ain't saying that I never had a good life.
But every other night I had to watch Brookside.
The soaps are getting boring and it's lonely at the bottom.
One day I'm gonna make it out the hood life.
