The Scientist Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

Tyler Ward and Kina Grannis.
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry.
You don't know how lovely you are.
I had to find you, tell you I need you.
Tell you I set you apart.
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions.
Oh let's go back to the start.
Running in circles, coming up tails.
Heads on a science apart.

Nobody said it was easy.
It's such a shame for us to part.
Nobody said it was easy.
No one ever said it would be this hard.
Oh take me back to the start.

Tyler Ward and Kina Grannis.
I was just guessing at numbers and figures.
Pulling your puzzles apart.
Questions of science, science and progress.
Do not speak as loud as my heart.
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me.
Oh and I rush to the start.
Running in circles, chasing our tails.
Coming back as we are.

Tyler Ward and Kina Grannis.
Nobody said it was easy.
It's such a shame for us to part.
Nobody said it was easy.
No one ever said it would be this hard.
Oh take me back to the start.
