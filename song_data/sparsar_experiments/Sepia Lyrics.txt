Sepia Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.

I'm coming in hot like a helicopter drop zone with the pilot drunk off Patron.

Little bitch like, This tequila's no joke!
Ho I take the whole bottle and also throw shrooms down the hole!
I'm imposing while you just posing.
so homie listen close.
Don't go sniffing where you shouldn't stick your nose in.
Now you defaced like you tied down and somebody let the crows in.
Then your body's left for decomposing.
Yeah, yeah, leave a motherfucker missing.
Like me, from this game cause damn I been gone a minute I just been.
Busy with that and this switching from Gizmo to Infinite and spitting.
different shit constantly.
But now I'm in this bitch and on full attack.
But I think I've lost it, been tryna pull it back.
And I am a rubber band man in fact, where you at?
Come get your drugs, homie, and give me my cash.
Ty Infinite, learn the name.
It's officially been placed in this game and it's here to stay.
Like present day corruption in the state.
But I am the exact opposite, a rebel sent to confederate.
I'm far from distant, it's like I'm right in your face.
And any attempt to stay away is feeble to my skate.
In other words you complete it like a stoner copped dank and got baked.
watching a cop spray the cause of a robbed bank.
People taking lives like they nothing.
Fuck it, this is hell and I'm escaping from it.
Music, my only outlet.
No friends, and no down bitch.
So I'm living my life, I'm living my life.
I don't give a fuck about what you think motherfucker.
It's Ty Infinite in this bitch, and I don't give a motherfucking shit.
