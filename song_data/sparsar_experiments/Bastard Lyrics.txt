Bastard Lyrics
by Ruthless Bastards.

Ruthless Bastards.

Check it, these cold days got me in a physical rage.
Walking through the dark path in this invisible maze.
My individual is criminal but lyrical plays.
A big part in my life in this critical state.
Apocolypse, twist up the bamboo.
Swine life I can't handle.
Cock the mack candle, pop the Jack Daniels.
Im a shine like candles in a blackout.
Your guaranteed to fall before the last bout.
Fuckin wit Ruthless you assed out.
The size of these guns a make you pass out.
Im like hollow tips the way I blast out.
Its all revolving, too much problems, no solving.
Ask me what Im involved in, Im a say robbin and mobbin.
Im runnin this shit nigga joggin.
No thanks for livin on Thanksgiving Im still starvin.

Yo, Im not new to this, Im true to this.
What you gonna do to lips?
Man if I tell you one more time Ive been doin this, mound u loopbp.
Ruthless be wettin these clowns up.
Yo partner turn that sound up.

And this one, new on the block just like a rookie.
Frontin like he hard dunn he mustve ate some thug cookies.
No evidence plus I heard his clique be on that tellin shit.
You let him sell a bit so bustin hims irrelevant.
Just get these presidents, the reallest thing man lust.
Once the papers in my hand its like I got a roush.
Ain't gainin trust, cause man I ain't tryina get bust.
Run for cover, pull a trigger, watch em all turn to dust.
A ribbon in the sky, I watched his mom dukes cry.
Too bad her son had to die for startin up the two four five.
Guns never lie, chains like slaves go but heavy.
Down in my belly, attatched to my waist is a celly.
For plannin funerals and gettin niggas buried.
I wanna lead this life but I can hear it callin me like R. Kelly.

Shoeless shine like sunny days.
My style on the loose like runaways.
Its crazed in the battle get you open like a bag of purple haze.
When hell get fucked up.
Can't hang slow the fuck up, I represent Staten.
Push my buttons you get stuck up.
I love thick bitches so ooh keep your ass shakin.
I be money makin, In nive seven I like em taken.
Fuck fakin wilden and breaken, in the club gettin my groove on.
The gat in my Tims just incase you wanna move on.
Been off the Bacardi to Moe.
Slayin this chick off that keeps sweatin my body so.

Sagoddi, swingin tux wit wallys.
Yall niggas dont wanna try me.
For them presidents by now Ill leave you dead.
Filled up wit hot lead, hollow heads for you thug breds.
Its the righteous, life is trifeless, challenges and sacrifices.
Ruthless cause we flip tracks, pack gats, and give slices.
A poor heistess, you think your nice now meet the nicest.
Son a actress, stick him like a cactus, bouce like a matress.
Teflon fatigues if you try to wack this.
You ain't know it was cold on these streets.
Only time its warm dunn when I got the heat.
Drag my knicks and five eights, I need a gimick to compete.
Triggas, Im squeazin em at the crossroad Im leavin em.
They got the guard locked I got knocked so I could be wit them.

Attack wit tactics, thats fantastic that for realah.
Throw me cuts to chop the beat wit your five claws.
Create tracks that blow the hinges off the doors.
Thats all I can stands and I can't stands no more.
Whirlwind mind spins off Seagrams gin.
Started all over and dont know where to begin.
Extreme measures got my thoughts on gettin pleasure.
These cats know that I clap holes through they leather.
Statens sick and we can't get no better.
Police trap, we get away too clever.
Lyrics jotted down on paper causes terror-.
Ism, now im gone hit em.
Give em what we been givin em, thats the rythem.
Staight up, all you crab niggas sleepin need to wake up.
Im like peroxide cause I stay bubblin in the cut.
Nigga please, Im thirsty for this cheese.
I run up in your lab and make your anti freeze.
Its like that, from the Stat where I live at.
The bees are snakes and they just feed off the fuckin rats.

All.
If im a bastard then your a bastard.
Everybodys a bastard.
Get the gats cause shit is drastic.
x5.
