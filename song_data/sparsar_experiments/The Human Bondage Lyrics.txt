The Human Bondage Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Out of my darkness it's rising in me.
Discover s the feelings hidden so deep.
I lose myself.
Affection for sadness and longing for pain.
I is dividing - deciphers the madness.
I loose myself.
Oh - The human bondage.
No way to control it.
I have to obey.
Just can't deny it - so deep inside me.
I lose myself.
My personal demon is linking the shades.
I could never see.
Now I know who I am.
I see myself.
Oh - The human bondage.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I am you.
Oh - The human bondage.
