Sun Lyrics
by Rusty.

Her feet hit the ground.
There's people all around.
She never wears makeup.
It never does her proud.
She works radio, late night radio.
She don't like the shit she's playing.
She does it for you kids.
The sun no favour.
The sun no favour.
She says lets have a drink.
I need some time to think.
We go down to dinner.
Sunday beer is cheap.
She works radio, modern rock and roll.
She don't like the shit she's playing.
She does it for the kids.
The sun no favour.
The sun no favour.
We go down to her place.
She has a real cool space.
She got it down in Parkdale.
The rent is great.
She works radio, oldies rock and roll.
She don't like the shit she's playing.
She does it for you kids.
The sun no favour.
The sun no favour.
