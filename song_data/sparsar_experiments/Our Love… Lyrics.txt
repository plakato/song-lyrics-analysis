Our Loveâ€¦ Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Our love love love, Love'll bring you down.
Our love love love, Love'll burn it down.
In the summer on.
the run, I slowed it down.
By the fire we were young, our heart knows it pounds.
Swear to God a million ought ta make it right now.
And I can still bring us down right now and then.
Somewhere in the dust I know we'll find it out.
A pulpit a mile high won't help.
Our love, love, love.
Love'll bring you down.
In the days when we were young.
Your body repaired.
Getting close to cryin' love.
Your heart, it was scared.
Swear to God Amelia, now we had it right there.
I'll pick you up, let you down in the end.
Somewhere in the dust I know we'll find it out.
A pulpit a mile high won't help us now.
And all we really want is to slow it down.
And all we really want is to let this go now.
And all we really want is to slow it down.
And all we really want is to let this go now.
Our love, love, love; love'll bring you down Our love, love, love; love'll.
bring you down.
Love, love; love'll bring us down.
