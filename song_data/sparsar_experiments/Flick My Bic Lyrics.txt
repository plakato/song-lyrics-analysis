Flick My Bic Lyrics
by Tyler Tracey.


Fuck rapping, I'm a professional baller.
Make a milli off a track and blow every last dollar.
I'm not a bartender but I'm a fucking shot caller.
Your bitch a groupie tonight and damn right I saw her.
Hoes on this dick, I rock a mic like Vick.
This bitch wanna ride but she don't even drive stick.
She wanna show me a trick, Look! No hands!
I see her magic box when I disappear her pants.
Been rhyming since I was just nine.
And now I'm killing rappers one beat at a time.
Speeding through this game no stop sign.
Imma take all your jewels and flash them like they mine.
Snapbacks and zig zags.
Backpacks and black flags.
Feeling gone off this ice blue bong.
On the green mile, no Tom Hanks.
Feeling fresh like a Tic Tac.
Riding around wearing all black.
I'm fly like a sparrow, call me Jack.
No dick riders, get off my nutsac.
Back to back to back hits, people.
I'm a player like a dog but never a beagle.
More like a pitbull without the shitty music.
Tear you limb from limb if you acting foolish.
NeoJock creates monster instrumentals.
I spit enough venom to depaint the walls.
Bars so cold your car stalls.
Lines so sick your doctor calls.
I'm a Lacrosse player and rap slayer.
Hip-Hop is the city and I'm the fucking mayor.
Fuck that, I'm the President of this industry.
You're lucky I don't dictate and have ya'll bow to me.
It's the bottom of the inning and bases are loaded.
They expect a homerun, the ceiling has opened.
I got a hundred thousand fans all watching in the stands.
Just hit the pitch, bitch, grand slam.
Sports metaphors so ya'll understand.
Don't want it to complicate your minds.
Listening to wack music with weak lines.
About fabricated crimes and whisper war cries.
This generation don't know true rhyme skills.
Rappers will say anything to stack them Benjamin bills.
Pac would've murdered you all if he could hear this.
If he was alive none of ya'll would have hits.
Then people wonder why albums don't sell.
Because the real lyricists are either dead or in jail.
The other ones like Nas and Em are trying to save rap.
But they gotta market to these kids listening to crap.
So here we go, kick this track.
Time to bring real rap back.
I gotta save this generation of rap fans.
And put my team on the map.
Jesus pieces aren't what make a man.
Setting goals and pushing forward is the plan.
To success, ya'll gotta understand.
Being the best doesn't just hop out of the pan.
This is an art so show some respect.
Don't just do it for the cheque.
Look at yourself in the mirror and check.
Before you wind up in a wreck.
I'm sick of all these fake ass bitches.
Only in this game for the money and the riches.
Ya'll motherfuckers ain't even worth to suck my dick.
So you pussy bitches can just flick my bic.
