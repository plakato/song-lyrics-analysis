Rapture Lyrics
by Antonym.

RAPTURE.
.
Welcome to the exposition.
I will be your guide this afternoon I'll walk you through the exhibition.
Appall at the gallery, take pictures no flash.
Sorry buddy you're gonna have to put that MP3 right in the trash.
Uh, Antonym who I be.
And theres two things you gotta learn about me.
Thats I make beats, and.
I rap like a muthafucka slap all you muthafuckas.
Hit that with a click-clack.
Better get back Imma bounce back unannounced thats.
No invitation, I'm an innovation, doctor for the nation.
Patience what a virtue, time'll tick tock then hurt you.
Get your self a curfew, you too late.
You'll never find a rapper this great.
Fate, man I do this for ya'll.
And I do this for me to but by tomorrow I'll fall.
And if I don't do nothing Imma ball.
And I'm counting all day like the clock on the wall.
.
I keep it more than a hundred.
I got enemies coming like its church on a sunday.
Keep em all on they toes like gymnastics backflips.
And I capture my rapture through this rap shit rap shit.
Go, go.
This that rolling happy down the street.
Doing doughnuts in the road skeet skeet.
Right on that ass party party.
Tomorrow morning sorry mommy.
Imma keep on rappin til I pull up in that Rari.
.
Interlude.

Welcome.
Welcome to the.
Nytra Exposition.
