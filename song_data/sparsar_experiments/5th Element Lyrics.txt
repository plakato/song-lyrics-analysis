5th Element Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Up in the club and I see 5 elements.
Bitch I'm Bruce Willis so you know I'm time Travellin.

Fuckin with these hoes then I slang rock.
Gamecube everyday super smash.
bros melee.
Fuck an xbox high tech cassios high tech.
Glock stacks increase.
Crack stick sneeze.
Relax make peace.
Tax for this piece.
Racks add the cheese.
Yung Leandoer only smack bitches.
You can't grease make forty keys fuck with these.
Imma throw some white cocaine keys.
Lean only fuck a bitch if she obese and Vietnamese.
Hoverboards and all up and we snort.
Teleport to a new timezone with an escort smoking newports.
Yung Lean AKA Neil Young.
Come in the club and I look like Obi-Wan.
I'm offical, J look like a missile.
Nah fuck that my chain be artificial.

Violator blood bitch.
Gangbang bruh it's four dicks.
Pepsi and that codeine.
Champange yeah that's luxury.
Super mario everyday.
500 stacks up on a suitcase.
Super mario everyday.
500 grams, yeah it get paid.
I move stacks and I pop drugs.
Posted up his face.
Mercury blaze ??? they're like.
Nicholas Cage.
I'm cuming in your face.
Live my life through a fisheye.
Put the razorblades back on stage.
Lacing up my Louis sneaks.
Then we finna have a race.
I got honey I got hunnids and I.
move them by the case.

Polar bears and dolphins.
Lean will put you in a coffin.
You already know what I'm puffin'.
Chronic in my system it's straight up morphine.
Lean will put you in a coffin.
Chronic in my system it's.
straight up morphine.
