DJ Unk.
I hit the club fresh, my stunna shades on.
2 Steppin gettin jiggy wit my J's on.
Don't get yo steps wroooong, don't try to bite mine.
2 Steppin, yea I'm back, Unk, one mo' time.
See we gon form a liiiine, and we gon step it right.
Now step it to the left, girl you know you dynomite.
Now have some good tiiiiimes, I see you got it right.
Beat my wrist ice, colder than a Bud Light.
Now I'ma take my tiiiiime, where the gangstaz at.
And you can still post the wall, nigga holla back.
Grey Goose and 'Yak, blunt filled wit kush.
I'm gettin jiggy wit it, smokin on that Gaw'rge Bush \- step.

DJ Unk.
Now take two steeeeeeps - to the left.
Now take two steeeeeeps - to the right.
Now bring it back, bring it back - yeah I made y'all Walk it Out.
Ev'rybody 2 Steppin, now we finna turn it out.
Now here we go agaiiiin - you already slow.
If you ain't 2 Steppin, get yer shit and hit the do'.
I'm shootin at ya toeeeees - like a West-urn.
I see you baby girl, sweatin outcha lil' perm.
They call me Big Wooooorm - where my money at?
2 Steppin wit my stacks, BITCH holla back.
The O.C. is back, y'all besta deal wit it.
And don't be steppin on my shoes when I get jiggy wit it.

A-2 Steeeeeeep....

A-gon' n 2 Step.
