Freestyle Friday 2 (Blue Sky) Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.

Talking to a cloud ozone ichat.
Processed is what Im spitting if u need drugs buy crack.

If u challenge me thats like you lookin for a hearst.
SOS we need to save our selves.
Cuz YM came in and just raped our shelves.
Digg in the crates it won't be no help.
We thought we was kings and he keyed our belts.
Aye buff it out if it hurts u.
Cuz me and this beats more than u can work thru.
Hurt murked put em in the dirt he be earth food.
Put him on a wave turn him to a surf dude.
Im unnecessary all my secondary uses of beats become legendary.
All my primarys uses become library sections.
Out of a binary session make violence.
Silent on a track and still reck it.
Damn I mighta overstepped it.
I gotta yoda presence sensai to them niggas to learn the force.
And of course im more crucial than mcilroy on the course.
Tiger Woods so the niggas can catch up.
I mustered up this talent and relish my chance to catch up.
And I ain't tryna be the next I'm tryna be the best of the best is what u dont.
get son.
Nigga I'm George Jetson and you George Jefferson.
Im in the future and you happy that you getting some.
I won't be happy til im passing em out.
Think I'm passin em now wait until im gassing out.
Cuz this is murder to excellence.
I murder tracks now so I can chill off exelan.
And peel off a bunch of niggas im better than.
Yeah them boys sick this they motherfucking medicine.
