I Do It Lyrics
by XO (Producer).


Its, my time its my time, 
, 
This soul, you cannot borrow 
The coupe, look like its hollow 
These, guys all up on my gonads Boy. Why don't you go swallow 
Red and blue jordans? Looking like I'm 5-0 
But, I'm 5'7 on sum, canibus 
And, I'm standing for that money till' they cannot stand us 
I'll do ya'! Dirty Ask me is your time I say it's skin thirty 
Nigga. What 
I said it's skin thirty And I'm full of it man? I swear im full of it. 
Pullin' your leg and im, pulling a ligament Fresher than mint, And I mean it
when, I say: im killing you, kids, 
Im, doin', it big Corporate 

of. The finish line. I finish: mine 
Fatality 
Academy flow, I'm on honor roll haters get peter-rolled 
At the bestest 
My niggas stay throwed, I tend to catch it, 
My fire out a mantel, not a candle 
Suggest. You clear, my knob cause. You can't handle 
Pull the ratchet boy. I'M screaming! Go! Go gadget 
On these faggots bums and douche bags 
Kill tracks. I do that 
I'm bout' bout', it Man, you be salty bout'. It 
And, I'm laughin' at you And imma' laugh off till' my mazel tov 
They tryna', bezzle dog. I knock it off. 
Like, jordan, heels Baby. 
The last call Got drive in my car son daily 
Get it I do it And do it big, 
These girls just want this bread, 
I'm clucking at you, chicken heads 
I just want this brain I'mma brainiac a maniac 
Where pinky at 
Anita, like baker, 
Cliche Nigga sue Me
