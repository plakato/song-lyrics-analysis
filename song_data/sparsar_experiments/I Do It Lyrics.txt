I Do It Lyrics
by XO (Producer).


Its my time, its my time.

This soul you cannot borrow.
The coupe look like its hollow.
These guys all up on my gonads, Boy why don't you go swallow.
Red and blue jordans looking like I'm 5-0.
But I'm 5'7 on sum canibus.
And I'm standing for that money till' they cannot stand us.
I'll do ya' dirty, Ask me is your time I say it's skin thirty.
Nigga, what?
I said it's skin thirty, And I'm full of it man I swear im full of it.
Pullin' your leg and im pulling a ligament, Fresher than mint, And I mean it.
when I say im killing you kids.
Im doin' it big, Corporate.

of the finish line I finish mine.
Fatality.
Academy flow, I'm on honor roll haters get peter-rolled.
At the bestest.
My niggas stay throwed I tend to catch it.
My fire out a mantel not a candle.
Suggest you clear my knob cause you can't handle.
Pull the ratchet boy I'm screaming go go gadget.
On these faggots, bums, and douche bags.
Kill tracks? I do that.
I'm bout' bout' it , Man you be salty bout' it.
And I'm laughin' at you , And imma' laugh off till' my mazel tov.
They tryna' bezzle dog, I knock it off.
Like jordan heels, Baby.
The last call , Got drive in my car son daily.
Get it? I do it, And do it big.
These girls just want this bread.
I'm clucking at you chicken heads.
I just want this brain I'mma brainiac a maniac.
Where pinky at?
Anita like baker.
Cliche? Nigga sue me!
