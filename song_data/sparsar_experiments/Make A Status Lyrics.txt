Make A Status Lyrics

Check it.
What do you do when you get really mad??
What do you do when something goes real bad??
What do you do when you're really really happy??
What do you do when you're day is going crappy??
What do you do when you're day is going great??
What do you do when you're filled with hate??
What do you do when you're the gladdest??
I'll tell you what to do, make a fucking status!!

Got off of work?? Make a status.
Boyfriends a jerk?? Make a status.
Miley Cyrus twerked?? Make a status.
This town is hurt?? Make a status.

Just took a shit?? Make a status.
Lit a bong and took a hit?? Make a status.
Punched a little kid?? Make a status.
Just got a new wig?? Make a status.

Ate some ice cream?? Make status.
Had a nice dream?? Make a status.
Made your girlfriend scream?? Make a status.
Life isn't what it seems?? Make a status.

Long hair don't care?? Make a status.
Got some new underwear?? Make a status.
Need some fresh air?? Make a status.
Life's not fair?? Make a status.

A status cures it all.
Make a status when you're walking in the mall.
Wondering who wants to play baseball??
Make a status and you might get a call.

Yaaaa, that's what I do all day.
People must think I've got a lot to say.
Maybe they think my life is plain.
Or maybe I just need to get laid.

Cause if I did, you know what I would do.
Make a status, and tell each and every one of you.
Tell the whole world how she rode my cock.
And how her legs spread wide like the hands of Spock.

Just kiddin', I'm not that mean.
Girls look at everyone, just not at me.
Maybe its because I still have acne.
I'll just make a status so you can laugh at me.

Just watched porn?? Make a status.
Ate some damn corn?? Make a status.
Met a guy named Bjorn?? Make a status.
Someone honked their horn?? Make a status.

Had a glass of wine?? Make a status.
Finished your homework on time?? Gotta make a status.
Gonna go commit a crime?? Make a status.
Seen a girl lookin' fine?? Make a status.

Got too drunk?? Make a status.
Last night you got jumped?? Make a status.
Just did a bump?? Make a status.
Like to take it in the rump?? Make a status.

Need to sell kush?? Make a status.
Growing out your bush?? Make a status.
That girls kind of butch?? Make a status.
Go smack her on the tush and make a status.

This shit ain't no joke.
I even make a status when I'm having a smoke.
But man, don't get it twisted.
Cause if you're not careful, you will get addicted.

Do you know what that's like??
Social media's more addictive than the crack pipe.
It has an everlasting half life.
Post so many statuses people call you an asswhipe.

Its like when you first learned to ride a bike.
Or when you're bowling and you finally get a strike.
No words can really explain the hype.
Of your post getting over 20 likes.

That's what you do man.
Make a status while you can.
And if they don't like it, well that's too bad.

Fuck 'em.
