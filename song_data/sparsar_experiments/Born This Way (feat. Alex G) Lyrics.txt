Born This Way (feat. Alex G) Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

My mama told me when I was young 
We are all born superstars 
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on 
In, the glass of her budoir 
There´s, nothing wrong. Lovin´, who you are 
She, said Cause he made you perfect. Babe 
So hold your head up. Girl and you´ll go far 
Listen to me when i say 
, 
I´m beautiful in my way, 
Cause god makes no mistakes 
I´m on the right track. Baby 
I was born this way. 
Don´T hide yourself in regret. 
Just love, youself and you´re, set 
I´m on the right track. Baby
