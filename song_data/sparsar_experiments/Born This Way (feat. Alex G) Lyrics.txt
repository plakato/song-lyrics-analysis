Born This Way (feat. Alex G) Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

My mama told me,when I was young.
We are all born superstars.
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on.
In the glass of her budoir.
There´s nothing wrong lovin´ who you are.
She said, Cause he made you perfect babe.
So hold your head up girl and you´ll go far.
Listen to me when i say.

I´m beautiful in my way.
Cause god makes no mistakes.
I´m on the right track baby.
I was born this way.
Don´t hide yourself in regret.
Just love youself and you´re set.
I´m on the right track baby.
I was born this way.
Ooo there ain't no other way.
Baby i was born this way.
Baby i was born this way.
Ooo there ain't no other way.
Baby i was born-.
I´m on the right track baby.
I was born this way.
Don´t be a drag -just be a queen.
Don´t be a drag -just be a queen.
Don´t be a drag -just be a queen.
Don´t be!
Give yourself prudence.
And Love your friends.
Subway kid, rejoice your truth.
In the religion of the insecure.
I must be myself, respect my youth.
A different lover is not a sin.
Belive capital H-I-M.
I love my life i love this record and.
Mi amore vole fe yah.

I´m beautiful in my way.
Cause god makes no mistakes.
I´m on the right track baby.
I was born this way.
Don´t hide yourself in regret.
Just love youself and you´re set.
I´m on the right track baby.
I was born this way.
Ooo there ain't no other way.
Baby i was born this way.
Baby i was born this way.
Ooo there ain't no other way.
Baby i was born-.
I´m on the right track baby.
I was born this way.
Don´t be a drag -just be a queen.
Wheter youŕe broke a evergreen.
You´re black,white,beige,chola descent.
