Please Lyrics
by Yung Gleesh.

You don't want work for me.
Got something for that ass boy.
Think ya work for free.
I got pounds and bags with that cash boy.
You ain't my cup of tea.
I got pounds of that boof batch.
Trash bags zipped down to my last boy.
Instagram this weed.
I just sold 3 Qp's.
I need four whole oz's.
When im sippin that lean.
An im smokin Irene, if ya know what I mean.
Its yung gleesh, yung gleetchie.
An I fuck wit BD's.
Im from DC , but shouts out pee wee.
Im from northeast? but I fuck wit GD's.

Nigga, pleaaasee.
Serve me some lean.
Pleaaasee! I need some leaaan.
Pleaaasee! serve me some weed!
Pleaaaseee! im so gleetchie.
Its like pleaaaseee! Serve me some lean!

Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up.
Turn up it all gon' turn up.
Yung gleesh gon get burnt up.

Work wit da work.
Bitch ya know yung gleesh was booked up.
And i serve that boof bag plus i got it gook'd up.
Serving drugs ya time got looked up.
Shortie want da work wit da work.
