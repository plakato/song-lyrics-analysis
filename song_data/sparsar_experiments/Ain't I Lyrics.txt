Ain't I Lyrics
by Yung La.


Ya got to know the boy futuristic, ain't it?
My work can make the J's do the jump, man can't it?
You got to know this the remix right here.
Grand Hustle baby it's the kings right here.
You got to know we guappin' pockets extra sloppy.
Don't I love my vegetables extra cheese and broccoli?
Don't Yung L.A. like to kick it like karate?
Don't I be with J-money serving everybody?
Ain't we up in magic city throwing up the broccoli?
Ain't me and Tip taking off like a rocket?
Ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my money long?
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I still putting on?

Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I?
Ain't I smoking strong? Ain't I putting on?
Ain't I rocking yays? Ain't my money.
long?
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I?
Ain't I in the ville? Ain't I on the.
hill?
Ain't I on a pill? Ain't I, ain't I.
real?

Okay, my rims so big I'm at the tip top, ain't I?
Choppers in the trunk will make you do the Macarena.
Pull up to the flo', yeah mothafucka ain't I?
All black coupe, I can buy a Benz, can't I?
Remix Yung L.A. and T.I., this a banger.
Dro, you on that thang? You don't hear me Trick, ain't I?
Big Rolls Royces, ain't I got 'em nauseous?
We be in Ferraris, the cars with the horses.
Ain't I on a pill riding down Bentley.
Iced 30 below minus the wind chill.
Ain't I packing chrome? Ain't I blowing strong?
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I got it going on?
Young Dro.

Ralph Lauren, purple label, ain't I fresh as I could be?
Made it through my situation, ain't I blessed as I could be?
Ain't I laughing at these haters tryna take a shot at me.
They don't know which way to go, I make it easy, follow me.
Honestly, ain't I insane? I think that's the way I gotta be.
Ain't I so so super fly? Boy ain't nobody hot as me.
Ain't T.I. all on TV when he wake up and go to sleep?
Everywhere they notice me, ay for yourself just go and see.
My community I'm serving though they.
hope I don't succeed.
Hear me speak they so intrigued, a-ain't he snitching? No indeed.
You come with that common flow, yo show I have to commander.
Since I see you can't take over I'll just have to volunteer.
A-ain't I yo superior? Listen here bruh you not up here.
I'm so zone 1 till it ain't funny twice the G that I appear.
Rep Bankhead so loud and clear, go be.
gone for 'bout a year.
So Paper Trail you gotta hear but ain't.
that Ain't I outta here? Ay!
