Idky Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


I, don't know, I don't know, 
I, don't know, I don't know, 
 
I, don't know, I don't know 
I, don't know, I don't know 
 
I, don't know, I don't know 
I, don't know, I don't know. 
 
I, don't know, I don't know 
Why you bitch niggas. Hatin' on the low 
I, don't know, I don't know 
In the backseat of the Ford sippin 
 
The Glock move forward. Ain'T got time to waste 
And. If you got a problem name a time and place 
I'll catch a body don't got time to play. 
Knock a nigga off and beat that murder case 
 
Bitch its V-Nasty and I be wit that bullshit 
Knock a nigga off when I slide wit them full clips 
I, be in my hood gettin' wit, my niggas 
While, you sittin in the house bein fake wit, the Niggas 
 
In, the foreign gettin', so high 
Why, yo bitch think I'm so fine 
Shit. I don't really know why 
 
If you fuckin' wit them niggas. Then you gone die 
 
Last night. I got so high 
Mix the sev with the lean. I don't know why. 
All these bitches still callin. I don't know why 
 
I, don't know, I don't know why 
I don't know, I don't know why 
 
I be ballin on them niggas. I don't know why 
I'll run up on a nigga with my whole squad. 
 
I be gettin money with my whole squad. 
Lil mama snortin powder call that nose job 
She, get it out her trick. That'S a hoes job 
 
2 litre watch the 4-5 
Hop in the zonin and sleepin 
Bitch popped a molly legs open. She tweekin' 
5 star dinin two days every weekend: 
My bitch, hella bad and your's, just decent 
 
I'm, a Oakland bitch. I grew up in the kitchen 
Posted on the block and my daddy really
whippin 
Nigga wan na talk, then that nigga get to missin 
2-2-3. I'M jumpin out the ditches
