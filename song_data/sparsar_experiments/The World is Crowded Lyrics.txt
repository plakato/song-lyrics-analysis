The World is Crowded Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


The world is crowded.
Did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
The world is crowded.
Did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?
Yes you did.

She made me buy her a chameleon.
With each eye on a different sun.
She made me watch Evangelion.
In another life did she blow my brains out?

The world is crowded.
Did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
The world is crowded.
Did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?
Yes you did.

She found me in Robot Restaurant.
Now I'll give her whatever she want.
Would she listen to a recording of my silly voice.
On the last day of her life?

The world is crowded.
Did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
The world is crowded.
Did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?
Yes you did.
