Friends Lyrics
by Rusty.

Conversations take to long.
All you say is wrong.
Your paranoid and shit.
I'll take no more of it.
Maybe I'm the same.
I could be me to blame.
You justify your need.
With every lie you bleed.
All my friends are lying.
All my friends are dying.
Your theories make me ill.
I wish you'd just sit still.
You satisfy your need.
With every lie you bleed.
I gave you a hit.
We share more of it.
Maybe I will drown.
It's me who brought you down.
All my friends are lying.
All my friends are dying.
You used to be my friend.
I think that's gonna end.
How long can I try.
I'm scared your gonna die.
Maybe I will drown.
It's me who brought you down.
All my friends are lying down.
All my friends are dying.
