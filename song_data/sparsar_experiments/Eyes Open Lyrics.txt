Eyes Open Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

Sister can you tell me, what you've been waiting for?
All along did you see someone wanting more?
And all elaborate plans you've made all fall away, fall away.
Anytime you wonder, you wonder where to begin.
All along did you see something more within?
And now the time has come to take what is yours, what is yours.
Somehow, somewhere.
Somehow, somewhere.
Take your opinions and go.
And all elaborate plans and desert nights are far away, far away.
Somehow, somewhere.
Somehow, somewhere.
These are the things they can never take away, take away.
And I've been looking for so long and now my eyes are open.
And I've been looking for so long and now my truth is showing.
And I've been looking for so long and now my eyes are open.
And I've been looking for so long and now my hands are broken.
And all elaborate plans are written in the hands we have, oh.
