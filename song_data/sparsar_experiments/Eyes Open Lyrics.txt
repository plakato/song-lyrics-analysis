Eyes Open Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

Sister, can you tell me what you've been waiting for 
All along? Did you see someone wanting more 
And all elaborate plans? You'Ve made all fall away, fall away. 
Anytime. You wonder you wonder where to begin 
All along? Did you see something more within 
And now? The time has come to take what is yours, what is yours, 
Somehow, somewhere 
Somehow somewhere 
Take your opinions and go 
And all elaborate plans and desert nights are far away far away 
Somehow somewhere 
Somehow somewhere 
These are the things they can never take away. Take away. 
And. I'Ve been looking for so long and now my eyes are open. 
And I've been looking for so long and now my truth is showing 
And I've been looking for so long and now my eyes are open. 
And I've been looking for so long and now my hands are broken. 
And all elaborate plans are written in the hands. We have oh
