Mac Melph Calio Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..

:.

Now everybody's talkin' about they run it and that war shit.
But they never seen a playa tellin' to y'all the real hit.
Brace yourself, protect y'allself.
Cuz I'ma take a journey to that three and I'ma start in the Melph.

From the Mac to the Melph to the Calio.....
I carry six guns, three eighties and K's, Glock forty-fives.
From the Mac to the Melph to the Calio....
I'ma shoot'cha in your head, makin' sure your dead.

Now as I raise up, it is a must I put my chrome K up.
Straight playa from Uptown, where everything goes down.
From up in the skinny smokin' puff, you feel I'm bustin'.
Twelve years strong in the Melphanine.
Nothin' but a Juvey growin' up around dopefiends.
I remember when we all used to just play ball.
But as time when by, my ball partners they started to fall.
But I was taught by the G from that old school.
As I got older, the old school seemed cool.
But back then you didn't need to pack no grip.
If you ain't got no strap, then you just got that ass whipped.
And it was cool with the Mac and the Calliope.
They came together and controlled nothin' but the dope.
This shit is real, I ain't gone bullshit at all bro.
The real story about the Mac, Melph, and Calio.

Now I'm headed to the muthafuckin' Mac.
Stop at the Black Gate so I could get a fat sack.
Roll up a Swisher now it's time to get blowed.
Creepin' round the Mac peepin' out them dog ho's.
Saw my nigga Slim, in a Torry bumpin' Ivan.
Got them tinted windows so them hoes don't see who drivin'.
With a loaded uzi, Tec-9, ak, I'm packin' down more.
Drivin' down real low, tryin' to get to circle.
Picked up my dope out the Mac.
That's when I headed down to the fiend.
Tryin' to get to the Melphenine.
Cuz in the Melph there's a hoe that I gotta see.
Shout real fine, and plus I heard she likes a G.
Met her creeped back there, and you know I fucked the hoe.
I fucked her so good, she gave me more to score.
Now my pockets are full, I got my gat.
I'm headed to the Calliope where the fuckin' dope at.
Saw my nigga Levi, with a nitro wearin' Levis.
We chillin' in a coke, smokin' blunts, gettin' high.
Five-oh pulled up, and at once I started to stash.
I had to break because I had the automatic.
I had to break to my shop, so I could sell all my dope.
I'm at the end of my journey, from the Mac, Melph, Calio.

Alright, they got a lot of my fuckin' homies, best believe they bout that.
Drama.
Shit, packin' them lugers and K's, ready to carry all my gangsta hits.
People are sayin' this, and people are sayin' that.
But I'm the nigga that's out the third and best believe I bring my gat.
I got psycho, up, lead and you heard I'm bout to pluck.
Broad, came to here and all in the studio they got pumped.
Don't try to trap me nigga cuz you know my heart is bigger.
I'm bound to pop 'em up, and you know we bring them triggers.
Rock and roll 'em up and best believe we pullin' shit.
Say you hard but I just don't feel because that third we never quit.
Just bounce 'em back and feel 'em, saw 'em go down and now they pay.
Just bring back your head cuz you've made your major play.
Now why you causin' gangsta shit? If you know you ain't bout no drama.
Your Daddy probably a coward, bitch go bow to your fuckin' Mama.

Now I done came up, and become a true soldier.
Kickin' it with this new bitch in the wild Magnolia.
Soon to be a soldier, soon as I get straight.
I'm sowin' nickel bags from out there, right by the Black Gate.
And it's the fire provider til' I get back to Mac.
Dub sack after the dub sack, my lungs is turnin' black.
Gettin' it with my nigga, soon as night fall we all got.
Money to make.
So we makin' it shake.
Movin' all night flights just to keep everythang.
But I'm short on the game in the funny style.
Start fuckin' around, with a juvenile.
You see the bitch was tryin' to sink a nigga, G.
Talkin' all my business in the muthafuckin' streets.
She said, What more do I got.
That bitch be naggin' a lot.
And what she failed to realize, is it's your own house.
And you don't have to tell a nigga what to do.
Gimme my shit, because you know that I'm leavin' you.
I got myself another connection in the Calliope.
These bitches strung out here, I gotta sell my dope.
And they are good and watch my back.
Because they see me ballin'.
But rather see a nigga fallin'.
And I got raps like that, from the snaps of the gat.
And if you touch'em I'm gone have to buck you down.
You stupid clown.
Momma should have told ya.
Never fuck around with a Uptown soldier.

Deep in the nineties and you know we gotta play it raw.
Jump in the ride, and voodoo tense you know we rep it so.
Say why you walkin' you too cute I know you got a car.
She say I wish and you too cute now where you goin'.
They call me Yella and what's your name, she say they call me Twin.
She started to grin I said get in and started a sharp spin.
Went to my house before I knew it I was fuckin' this hoe.
The skin is loose I'm hearin' $lu somebody's at the door.
And it's that nigga who's pussy whipped and kinda out of control.
I didn't have my shit, I hit the floor I ran and drove this hoe.
He with his friend, shout throughout my house SAY TWIN.
I left my car, stretched out the back and now you caught slippin'.
About a mile from the rip of the Calliope.
I say that now, buck 'em down.
Say up now yo!
I kick it to him, he say What I'm down I got a Mac.
As a matter of fact let's hit the Mac now where the braids at?
I said I need to help the girl.
He said What's up, what's happenin'?
I say You strapped?, He said Fa sho, I'm always bout that action.
And he went because he's juvey yes just like myself.
Talkin' bout lil' yo-yo cruise the scene because he's out the Melph.
Back to the scene, open the ridge, yeah he cost a broad.
He leaves the scene reppin' it down reppin' for his ward.
We hit the light and started bangin'killed the hoe.
Just for two mills.
One they killed, yo I think it was a set-up.

From the Mac to the Melph to the Calio.
