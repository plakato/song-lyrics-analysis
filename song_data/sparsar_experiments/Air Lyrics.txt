Air Lyrics
by Wretch 32.

Link Wretch 32 
Everybody's, not alike, 
Some got a wallet full of pride 
But. Even Ian isn't right. 
Cuh even Peter had a price 
 
I couldn't breathe down here. 
We make paper from the trees down here. 
Insomnia. Couldn'T sleep down here, 
Cuh everybody's tryna, wake up in their dreams down here! 
The birdies are mad for my rhyme flute 
Return of the mack. They like iTunes, 
They press, my buttons. When they tell me iChat 
Cause, I am Alfie to cats, got the gift of the gats fact 
 
When I come up for air 
What. Do the people say Yeah 
Boy? Have you heard that sound 
Coming out the stereos round, my town, 
Oh yeah boy? Have you heard that sound 
Coming out the stereos round my town, 
 
Link, Wretch 32 
 
A price? He had, I guess unfortunate. 
I'Ve started to spring I'm quite important. 
Spend summer with me. I might leave autumn 
I might MC the Pisces walked in 
I need precautions for Cindy Crawfords 
Don't need a foursome. I need divorcing 
Why Cuh, I'm Mr. Flirtatious 
Tryna put Alesha's name on my playlist 
This ain't like back in the day, I'm now famous 
Snap snap papping away. They might chase us 
Yeah and what's popping up in here, 
Call me Mr. Asthmatic, when I'm popping up for air 
 
Hey boy. What'S that sound coming out my stereo 
Hey boy? What'S that sound coming out my stereo
