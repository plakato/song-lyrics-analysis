Bad Boys (Of Rock N Roll) Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

All right.

So we look kind of weird to you.
Well, how do you look to me?
How cool you sit there, and sneer all through.
The night don't you like what you see?

What are you thinking? What will you do?
When you get your chance to display.
All the hang ups inside of you.
Well, we don't care what you say.

We're the bad boys of rock and roll.
Mad boys out of control.
Bad boys of rock and roll.
How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?

So you say we're offending you.
What's wrong is it something we said?
Look at you squirm, hey, you're sweating too.
At least now i know you ain't dead.

You're always trying to be so hard.
Tearing down all that we do.
We're just having a good time so let down your guard.
We'll prove to you it ain't true.

We're the bad boys of rock and roll.
Mad boys out of control.
Bad boys of rock and roll.
How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?

Now us boys we're annoying too.
Well, we're sorry to be in your way.
You can't stand anything we do.
Well, what would you like us to say?

We just want to enjoy our lives.
And have fun with all that we do.
Still you poison the good thing with all of your lies.
Well, we're sick of listening to you.

We're the bad boys of rock and roll.
Mad boys out of control.
Bad boys of rock and roll.
How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?

Bad boys of rock and roll.
Mad boys out of control.
Bad boys of rock and roll.
How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?

How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?

How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?

How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?

How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?

How bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free?
