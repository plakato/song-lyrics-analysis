Black River Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Black River.

You're bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter is sweet.
So give in, give in, give in, give me more.
Your figure, figure, figure, figure of speech.
Someone will face the fire if you fall.
And when you fall.

Staring down the barrel of a gun.
I knew that you would be the one.
Raise a glass, looking at the sun.
Mimic life you've seen and spun.

Well you told me last night that you think.
About how you and I met in the spring of our lives.
You've regressed to the sting.
Chasing your shadow in the mirror of the king.

Hearing you sing.

Raise me from the living I've come again.
Raise me to the limits you gave me then.
Save me from the river of sin again, again, again.
Black River.

Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger than me.
Waiting to face the barrel when you call.
Wither, wither, wither, wither in me.
Ready to face the fire if you fall.
And when you fall.

Staring down the barrel of a gun.
I knew that you would be the one.
Raise a glass looking at the sun.
Mimic life you've seen then spun.

Well you told me last night that you think.
About how you and I met in the spring of our lives.
You've regressed to the sting.
Chasing your shadow in the mirror of the king.

Hearing you sing.

Raise me from the living I've come again.
Raise me to the limits you gave me then.
Save me from the river of sin again, again, again.
Black River.
Black River.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.
And when you fall.

Staring down the barrel of a gun.
I knew that you would be the one.
Raise a glass looking at the sun.
Mimic life you've seen then spun.

Well you told me last night that you think.
About how you and I met in the spring of our lives.
You've regressed to the sting.
Chasing your shadow in the mirror of the king.

Hearing you sing.

Raise me from the living I've come again.
Raise me to the limits you gave me then.
Save me from the river of sin again, again, again.
Black River.
Black River.

You'll chase, you'll wither, your sin, black river!
You'll chase, you'll wither, your sin, black river!
You'll chase, you'll wither, your sin, black river!
You'll chase, you'll wither, your sin, black river!
