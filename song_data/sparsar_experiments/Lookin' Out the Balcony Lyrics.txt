Lookin' Out the Balcony Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


Lookin' out the balcony, all I see is targets. 
I could pop a nigga in Albany ..., all the way from here, 
Supposedly shorty's doubtin' me like I ain't the hardest 
But. He knows what I'm about and he's not trying to get smeared 
All across his kitchen counter. While he's rounding up a meal 
For, his dandy f*cking family. Make their candy-asses peel 
2 ni√±as, holding ninas. Mandy's ass is real 
But I'll toss the gun to her prima and let Sandy blast the steel. 
Cause she's never been arrested. No criminal record 
I'll have shorty out by breakfast, bless her with a diamond necklace 
That's just for keeping her flappers closed.. That'S my dapper ho 
I'm, her dapper don and we're gon' clap you bro 
That's calicoes, all up in your cabbage, bro, 
And I'll, think nothing of it after a plate of platanos 
She knows eventually we'll live large down south 
With brown stones on her finger. The price of a town-house 
What up 
My gangsta broad, is harder than you. Wankstas are 
She'll shank your heart all for just a Thank you, ma'. 
And. She can throw them hands: ..., 
 ..., but she's, a serial killer, known to rob, kicks lucky charms and golden
grams. 
But, that's all in the past, 
Now she'll get all in that ass 
Due. To no reason more than just for a laugh, 
I see you're still sleeping on her ... Snorlax 
'Til she's pistol-whipping, your momma for more racks 
So, don't make my chick Rosa, slash your sofa 
For them grams of coca. Pass'em over Casanova 
You're, either going to cooperate or Get shot today, 
And don't try to reason with her
