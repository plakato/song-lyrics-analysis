Lookin' Out the Balcony Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


Lookin' out the balcony, all I see is targets.
I could pop a nigga in Albany... all the way from here.
Supposedly, shorty's doubtin' me, like I ain't the hardest.
But, he knows what I'm about and he's not trying to get smeared.
All across his kitchen counter while he's rounding up a meal.
For his dandy f*cking family. Make their candy-asses peel.
2 ni√±as holding ninas. Mandy's ass is real.
But I'll toss the gun to her prima and let Sandy blast the steel.
Cause she's never been arrested - no criminal record.
I'll have shorty out by breakfast, bless her with a diamond necklace.
That's just for keeping her flappers closed. That's my dapper ho.
I'm her dapper don, and we're gon' clap you, bro.
That's calicoes all up in your cabbage, bro.
And I'll think nothing of it after a plate of platanos.
She knows, eventually, we'll live large, down south.
With brown stones on her finger the price of a town-house.
What up?
My gangsta broad is harder than you wankstas are.
She'll shank your heart, all for just a Thank you, ma'..
And she can throw them hands....
... but she's a serial killer, known to rob kicks, lucky charms and golden.
grams.
But, that's all in the past.
Now, she'll get all in that ass.
Due to no reason more than just for a laugh.
I see you're still sleeping on her... Snorlax.
'Til she's pistol-whipping your momma for more racks.
So, don't make my chick, Rosa slash your sofa.
For them grams of coca. Pass'em over, Casanova.
You're either going to cooperate, or get shot today.
And don't try to reason with her; she won't have a lot to say.
That's my half-breed Brazilian sponsor.
Other half: Sicilian mobster.
And she will kill for this Domini-Colombian.
So, trust me when I say we're in the building.
Now, buzz me in.
