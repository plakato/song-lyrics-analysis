Already Dead Lyrics
by The Virus.

See the death on the horizon - We're already dead.
Don't open up yours eyes- We're already dead.
You know the end is coming soon- We're already dead.
Destruction and demise- We're already dead.

So take a look around.
The world has fallen.
Problems everywhere.
Your life is stolen.

We're already dead.

See the rubble on the city streets- We're already dead.
Can't escape the aftermath- We're already dead.
Monuments of power at our feet- We're already dead.
A world torn in half- We're already dead.

Leaders get what they want in vain-We're already dead.
A country torn by war-We're already dead.
And the children feel the pain-We're already dead.
So many victims of this horror-We're already dead.

We're already dead, dead, dead.
We're already dead.
