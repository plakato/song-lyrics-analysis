RG Round 0 Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

Vita Et Mors.

You hear that?
Homie It's crunch time.
Yo I'm a boxer fighting a stick figure.
Cause all I do is punch lines.
These rhymes that I write can cause barbarian fights.
You're looking at batman in the stars.
Homie you're staring at a Dark Knight.
It's only right that I be grabbing this gold.
Taking your life then after you die I come back and start stabbing your soul.
Yo these voices scream in my head keep getting louder.
I'll dead you, rip out your organs, crush your bones and snort the powder.
I need more respect homie, my name should be truly known.
Your bitch sucked my dick at last Mardi Gras.
She gives Superdome.
These poems I show you are so evil and crude.
They'll leave you confused.
You'll need more than a rap genius my dude.
Yo Tunes.
You're not borrowing you biting.
So next time you find yourself chewing while writing.
Remember this piece of advice it goes like this.
Everything you eat comes out as shit.
