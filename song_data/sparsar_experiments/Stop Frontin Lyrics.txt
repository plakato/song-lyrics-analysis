Stop Frontin Lyrics
by The Undergods.


When you swing it, make sure you mean it.
Swift knee kick to the penis, that can happen real quick genius.
Satisfaction through an action, old fashioned.
Close caption ain't looking at it, that's when it trap you.
The Art of War's the war of art.
Two emcees going in, going off, look how the vocals come off.

Perfect, you are learning to worship the serpent.
At first to servants what we spit seem worthless.
But if you give it urgent, you will witness purpose.
This style of language we challenged, exiled and banished.
They gave it to Keith Murray and Canibus.
I write 'til the ink pen ends.
Yet again, leather hands being held together by rubber bands.
The metaphor approaches, agoraphobic poets protest.
Crush, kill, destroy, stress.
Parabolic electronics.
Listen to far off objects that are more interesting to talk with.
I stock market crash it then park it.
Tax order in my rap office, pays cash on the province.
Soon now very soon, we are going to see the king.
Take off your watch and your rings.
Let me see the floor touch your chin.
You will never touch another microphone again.

So beware, camouflage is the colour of fear.
Undergods been underground for a billion years.
See we make fresh rhymes daily.
We the Burnout Brothers, nigga, really?
Things just stink and we made a billion rhymes.
Just imagine if you did this a trillion times.
Lines on the paper look like a grid locator.
But at first there is always no data.
Better to die for this than to live for yourself.
What the fuck type of way is that to say we need help.

It costs a round trip flight and thirty days and nights.
Let me give you some advice.
Never in life try to emulate the things you see us doing on the mic.
Just sign this roster and line up over there with ya mamma.
And wait till we bring out your father.
STOP FRONTIN.
