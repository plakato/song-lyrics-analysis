Imaginary Friends Lyrics
by Yung God.


I play hide and seek with my shadow.
My princess waiting in her castle.
Be the Ocean Gang nigga, you a tadpole.
Your girl came up commando.
And she gonna let me play with her asshole.
You can run with me or get trampled.
Yung God pull your bitch at the chapel.
You can put my swag in a capsule.
My head need a motherfuckin axle.
Cuz my vision be spinnin, when I'm in your bitch.
Young nigga goin deeper than a paddle.
These niggas don't wanna go to battle.
I'll take your grandmother hostage, in a rocking chair and get it poppin.
'.

All my friends imaginary.
Ho open up I'm the tooth fairy.
I'm in that water like Huckleberry on an expedition for narcotics.
Yung God you know me, I'mma do this till I O.D.
I'm a walking dead, you're a human being.
I smoke green like nicotine.
Ocean Gang, Amanda Todd.

Someone call Charles Ramsey.
Has twenty hoes in this house and they all patrolled by Yung God.
I'm on my job, so high can't even speak English.
I don't give a fuck nigga.

That nigga that you dream about.
Yung God bring the demons out.
She gon' bring the semen out, out of our penis.
Pluto, Venus, ????, I am nothing like Magic.
Or a magnum in that bitch.
I been blowin on that kush, so I look like Jeremy Lin.
Tell that ho I don't ever wanna see her face again.
After she give me head, I'mma chill with my imaginary friends.
I'm a light skinned nigga.

I just can't stop laughing though.
My nigga E-Boy in the booth with me right now.
He came over to sell me some motherfuckin, some drugs and shit.
I ain't gonna say his government name cuz that nigga.
A bonified motherfuckin dope dealer.
