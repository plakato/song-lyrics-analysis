Dark Corners Lyrics
by Akala.

Say they wouldn't come to the wedding  .
On his deathbed  .
.
Ye they demanded better  .
She ain't never missed a week  .
For those underground  .
  .
My blood was exchange  .
Products that can't resembles his age  .
He had struggling with a sickness ever since 14  .
The scientist to offer the report disappeared  .
That something they did prosper  .
But had strange dreams of justice and helping the poor  .
Going to wealth  .
And we let it give us chase  .
Billions couldn't find him another day, another pain  .
Of what he accomplished  .
That made it worth pursuing his dreams  .
No, cannot run  .
Everything you yapping for been, cut never raw, like all users  .
And of course, there was that was that we're fighting  .
But when they found out he was addicted to drugs  .
They were slightly annoyed  .
Drug addicted politician  .
No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that's right  .
All he could see is images of death reaching him  .
When they throw back those release  .
We live on borrowed time  .
Dark corners  .
Dark corners  .
But despite all the wealth and the things that he owned  .
Viictims of mercenaries that this government betrayed  .
When he remembered the hand that touched him finally understood what it means  .
It was a rainy night  .
.
But it always gets away  .
Even his father was slightly jealous  .
She couldn't denied it, it was true  .
Finally got clean  .
Message is clear, as power is old  .
Michelle left the house in the storm  .
It was two people  .
So when they found that he was english  .
  .
Off the evil, on the struggle  .
And they say there is no difference  .
Energy ain't created or destroyed if this changes form  .
As the needles plunge into the vein  .
And it was the only time my life, my mind felt so clear  .
The dark corners are the place  .
Power changes reality  .
Parents from Nigeria  .
Was a slave labour  .
Both of them doctors  .
She was in it  .
His whole body went into shock  .
Her parents wanted for her a nice young looking boy  .
He didn't know he was so conventional  .
Church every sunday  .
Afghan something was strange  .
No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that's right  .
But dark corners  .
When them dark corners come  .
In his life with himself  .
Didn't know what in her mind  .
  .
Ran straight back to the same block where he use to cop it  .
Her parents had decided that they would apologise  .
Death always catches up  .
Once we play the songs  .
All that come back is scrutiny  .
No, cannot run  .
Where we look death in the faces  .
Nice house in the states  .
And we cannot back it up  .
  .
The great creator  .
Colours changed  .
Whatever I was self, a wordy a definition  .
.
Fighted the cold sweat  .
This time the substance, the injected was pure  .
His brains forget to tell the lungs that they needed to breathe  .
She never saw the truck before it ended her life  .
And this CEO  .
Whatever convention it was  .
They had plans to start a family  .
But they never got the chance in the end  .
The was an innovator  .
A good girl, a normal girl that was everybody's view  .
Should have seen him with a craze  .
Maybe that's part of why she chose him  .
Can't see  .
Find them accident  .
But he was clever  .
But ye it was true  .
Became an icon  .
To keep, the man that was throwing from the acapella public  .
It's blood  .
Dark corners  .
His old connect came up in the road, new supplier  .
Each time it was released  .
Thanks to the revolutionary, great victim  .
Dark corners  .
So when the news came about Michelle, he just lost it  .
When we running our alarms  .
Calling all money ye  .
Always spiritualizing  .
I'm a kind of nigga who is troubled inside  .
And met a girl  .
Now wish to show you  .
In which powerful grows  .
Had a off leverage with the media only painted him as gold  .
Grow up with both parents  .
Dark corners are the place  .
Studying law  .
And though this annoyed her  .
And fell asleep  .
When we hit them dark corners  .
But how well did he play with the cards that were dealt  .
They use to make the pain disappear  .
The sound just travels on  .
When dark corners come  .
When he hit straight fire  .
Everest school she was top of the class  .
But beneath all the shine and the sheen  .
Some characterize it as the judgement of the sinners  .
It was totally shameful  .
Triple the family coffins  .
He couldn't find comfort for his soul  .
Though, the ain't never be rich  .
Brave much higher  .
Now he's in the dark corners  .
With a wedding in June  .
