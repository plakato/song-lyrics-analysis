PreLude Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


I'm tryna get to the top.
But they want me to flop.
Blacks folks wanna wish you well.
Turn around they wish you fail.
Never been the one to kiss and tell.
Damn, these girls don't play fair.
Like Push, I'm on a beach chair.
Looking around I see no love here.
Seems like everybody pretending.
Thats why we gonna have a bad ending.
Turn a main chick into a side chick.
All niggas treating girl like Billie Jean.
Me? I just can't do it.
So I just beat it.
Cause my Ma was Billie Jean.

As a little boy I?
As a little boy I.
