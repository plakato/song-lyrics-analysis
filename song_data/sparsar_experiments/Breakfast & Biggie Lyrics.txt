Breakfast & Biggie Lyrics
by WordPlay T.JAY.


Woke this morning Biggie Smalls was on the speakers.
Just one of those days like nothing can defeat us.
Put Proffit on the drums so you fools can't beat us.
We stay making hits, yes, something like Jeter.
And looking for some Franklins nothing like Aretha.
And feeling real nice eating breakfast from my diva.
Before I hit the door I lace my high top Adidas.
Say hello to the world like Wal-Mart greeters.
And I just got paid pockets fatter than Peter Griffin.
Bass lower than a creeper so.
Ha, Ha, Ha Ha Ha check out this bizarre.
Bumping nothing but the classics from the trunk of my car.
There is no reasonable doubt I'm about to blow the speakers out.
And you can't knock my hustle we gone always be on route.
On the road to success and once again it's nothing less.
My day just doesn't start without Chris Wallace on the deck yes.

I don't need no Beamer, Benz, or the Bentley.
That kind of stuff isn't in me I live my life simply.
Commercial dudes are funny comic like Ziggy.
All I need is breakfast while I'm listening to Biggie.
Cause all they do is party and bull SHHHH.
I'm like man can we listen to some music.
I ain't hating I just take it to the pulpit.
It's been a long time and I've been praying for some newness.

I'm reciting figure speech cause these other poets weak.
And it didn't take them long cause they hating what I'm doing.
I see the way they roam and they hate that they've been ruined.
You can go to KEV and record you're little single.
But I make the booth numb and you're trying to make it tingle.
What's beef? I'm a ask you to proceed.
In a man I fear not because everybody bleeds.
You couldn't match our grind if you had tracing paper.
We've gotten this far along ain't asking for no favors.
Last time I checked we're on the rise like vapors.
Boys be swag surfing when they needing life savers.
Ain't making songs no more they're just tryna chase a dollar.
Do not disturb because these cats just shouldn't bother.
Nothing like the U of A but I take these fools to college.
I prefer your study guide to be the late Chris Wallace, Holler.

By the end of the night I lace my high top Nikes.
And while I'm getting fresh I'm listening to the Frank White.
I said on Chris Farley that we'd be a little tardy.
But now that we're here we gone move some girl's bodies.
Cause my ladies in the Rock love to sip on some Ciroc.
And the chicks up on the hill keep the Goose on chill.
And why they can't listen to your junk it's so apparent.
How you get so incoherent, she keeps my CD blaring.
And this is what happens to MC's when they work at Mickey D's.
And spend their whole check on a set of 23's.
You might want to save up because rapping ain't gone pay ya.
Cause if I rhymed like that then I prolly been done gave up.
Sitting at the top my Lord keeps pressing page up.
And watching rhymers backspace we insert our flavor.
We're getting our return and your numbers on lock.
Shifting Big SHHH, putting classics on the box, YUP.
