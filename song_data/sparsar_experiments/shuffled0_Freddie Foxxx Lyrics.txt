Freddie Foxxx Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.

Get ready I'm coming jetti with the medi on my socks.
But, talent flops even if your boy's styling hot.


Or try to quarrel in court or this war'll be short.
Your whore has 'em, like full body with even more spasms.
It's Unorthodocks, opposite of Freddie Foxxx.

I'm wilding with violent thoughts more vile than Stalingrads.
Tongue and fingers in your broad's heart performing cunnilingus.
To be a bandcamp billionaire soon as my album drops.

Stupid ass, shooting back at the Lord with mortal retorts.
So cats of soft consistancy are falling off consistnantly.
Never freezing even when the cops steady many Glocks.
Make her soul cum, heard of a full atman orgasm?
He said he turn the petty into confetti when he rocks.
But I just smile and nod cuz meenwhile I'm piling wads.
Invest in my penny stocks, use them as building blocks.
Dope beats with a dome piece deep as Alan Watts.
Don't be a poor sport cuz I store more in the shorts.
Your whore'll report she's at my fort for oral support.
It's the youngest lynguists coming with the stunning english.
