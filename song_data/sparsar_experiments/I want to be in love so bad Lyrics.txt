I want to be in love so bad Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Remember when you drew that heart on the back of my car in the dust that.
settled from the fire fly drive down the riverside.
That's a memory still burning in my mind after all this time.
Even though the spring rains came and washed it dry.
And i know that we were young But I haven't felt that in so long.
And I want to be in love so bad.
I want to find that thing that we had.
I want to make it last forever.
This time I'm not holding back.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad.
Like Hepburn fell for Tracy.
That star crossed kind of crazy.
No one else can understand.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad.
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad.
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na.
Well this time I won't settle for anything less.
Than firework kisses and midnight making love.
All the things that my heart misses about us.
And it's tough, cause everyone else seems to have it.
That cinematic, movie magic.
I want to be happy for them but it's tragic.
Cause I want to be in love so bad.
I want to find that thing that we had.
I want to make it last forever.
This time I'm not holding back.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad.
Like hepburn fell for Tracy.
That star crossed kind of crazy.
No one else can undderstand.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad.
I can dream, I won't quit, I believe it exists.
I want passion, I want fire, undeniable desire.
Cause you showed me what it could be.
And I want to be in love so bad.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na.
When it finally comes along.
This time I'll hold on.
Cause I want to be in love so bad.
I want to find that thing that we had.
I want to make it last forever.
This time I'm not holding back.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad.
Like Hepburn fell for Tracy.
That star crossed kind of crazy.
No one else can understand.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad.
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad.
Na, Na, Na, Yeah yeah.
I want to be in love so bad.
Na, Na, Na, Bad, Bad.
Yeah, I want to be in love so bad, bad, bad.
