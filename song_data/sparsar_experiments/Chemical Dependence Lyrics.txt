Chemical Dependence Lyrics
by Wrinkle Neck Mules.

Spiritual desperation and a chemical dependence.
It's been a long, long road.
Rasters and vectors keep switching.
I'm sitting here wishing.
This paper would burn.

Today was the first day I haven't been thirsty.
In two days and three months before.
Learning to speak it.
But they just can't make me believe.
I've a use for these words.

And I don't like to go out on the weekends.
Those Baptists got nothing on me.
Send my regards to your boyfriend.
You know just where you can find me.
Spiritual desperation and chemical dependence.

It's been a long, long road.
One day I'll be leaving, you better believe.
I'll go running like hell through that door.
Because I can't wait to go out on the weekends.
And those Baptists going to see me in church.

Say your goodbyes to your boyfriend.
Or he's entering a new world of hurt.
Entering a new world of hurt.
New world of hurt.
