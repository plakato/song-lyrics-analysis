Supreme Lyrics
by Wrathmatics.


This beat takes me back to the days when i was a teenager, 
Sellin' weed to the strangers at the bus station. 
Never really was patient, 
Lookin' sideways 
 
Fuck minimum wage cuz crime pays 
In the ze 
And in a major way e40. Had my mind
goin 
Thats a rhyme omen. 
Let me try flowin 
 
Open for the crowd. Look around 
Is it worth it. 
My homie's, steady illen and I'm always puttin' work in 
Either, death or jail is certain 
So im buildin until the curtain closes on me, 
 
Believe that I'm anomalous 
Could fight a trojan army, 
Steady listening to Hiero 
Started on my high road 
Elevate my mind, 
To, the Highs from the lows: 
 
Just, another episode, 
Smokin blunt after blunt 
I - must have stunted my growth 
Cuz. I was ready to erupt 
And, everybody was corrupt, 
 
But, it ain't, always what it seems. 
Another couple years, 
And we'll be reigning supreme, 
 
When, the halo's fly and the rain coats dry 
I feel like i could be a king
 
I brainstorm. These waveforms 
Its, like the .wavs form a stom in my brain 
Feel, the pain 
Now. My food is organic. 
My muse is organic, 
My roots all planted 
In. The truths of the planets 
And motherfuckers can't stand it 
 
Cuz, I'm clever with the words 
And better with the work 
Brother set me to the side. 
Said we're movin off of bird ave 
cool where to 
He said the burbs 
It sounded so absurd man. He couldn't have 
 
But, he did and then it worked out. 
A year later, i was down south 
In 6-1-9 San, Diego 
Just movin', hella fuego 
Sharpened up my pen game 
With, my homie from Encanto 
 
Fucked, around recorded in some studio, centers 
Where, the walls filled with plaques 
Remember turn around and look back, 
 
Cuz. It ain't. Always what it seems 
Another couple years, 
And we'll be reigning supreme, 
 
When, the halo's fly and the rain coats dry 
I feel like i could be a king, 
 
See. I was finally getting weight in 
When. My brothers home was raided 
Man. He got like 900 days when incarcerated, 
Feeling heavy faded with this baby on the way 
The world is on my shoulders. 
Everyday I'm gettin older 
 
Had to fall back on the kushion 
Some padding in my pattern. 
Slow off all the pushin 
Get my mind over the matter, 
Word to that rare thang 
She got me on the latter 
Or up in the stairway 
Where. Nobody who wears hate 
 
See, i i had my know how 
But then i understood it 
Added in some wisdom, 
And everything is fluent 
Embedded. In my music 
A foundation for a kingdom 
Everything, i went through 
Man. It liberated freedom to my soul, 
 
Now, I'm refined, 
I'm, refreshed, 
Progressed 
With every step, 
Thats momentum 
And this tracks, my memento, 
 
Cuz. It ain't always what it seems. 
We'Ll be reigning supreme, 
, 
When, the halo's fly and the rain coats dry. 
I feel like. I could be a king, 
,
