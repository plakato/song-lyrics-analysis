Marie Celeste Lyrics
by The Union.


The very own Marie Celeste.
Never was an easy ride.
She stood somebody so proud.
Couldn't trust no more if he tried.
Right now the hatches in the twilight.
Strike a flag of dignity.
Now the captain wants to lead me to the gallo.
Or find me for mutiny.

What's the use, man, I ain't got a dime.
I ain't got money on your name.
Say ain't got none of mine.

No one said it would be easy.
But my God, how we tried.
Some of them cruel and crazy.
Some of them just dead inside.
You drove some good men to the bottom.
For some of them tore a hole in their pride.

So what's the use, man, you know we ain't got a dime.
I ain't got money on your name.
Say ain't got none of mine.
No, I ain't got no money into your name.
Say I ain't got none of mine.

Sailing on these earned waters.
The longer than I can recall.
We set sail believing.
You was all for one and one for all.
This time I jump ship and here for drowling.
Unless you want to drown us all.

So what's the use, man, you know I ain't got a dime.
I ain't got money in your name.
Say I ain't got none of mine.
No, I ain't got money into your name.
Said I ain't got none of mine.
No, I ain't got no money into your name.
Say I ain't got nones of mine.
