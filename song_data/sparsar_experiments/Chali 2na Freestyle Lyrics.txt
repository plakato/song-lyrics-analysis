Chali 2na Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway.

Chali 2na.
Like that like that ya don't stop, check it.
One mo' time for the people out there.
It goes peace -- if you come to see me rebel.
2na-Fish'll come ready like I was Edie Brickell.
I'm everlasting, never will my head expand.
This Publisher is Clearinghouse like I'm Ed McMahon.
I getcha -- open like a bullet wound, test the repoitoire.
And I'll connect a right cross to your upper jaw.
I'm on my toes, all my foes beware.
Cause 2na-Fish'll tackle flows like I'm Rosie Grier, yeah.
Forgot to tell you the response is choice.
Comin to smother the brother with the monster voice.
It's gonna -- wipe slow specimen I got the hype.
So listen in lyrical nitro-glycerin.
We pack a punch like a earthquake set.
Comin through your {fuckin} tapedeck is how we shake {shit}.
So all you {bitch-ass} brothers take shelter.
Or you'll be on my conveyor belt when I melt ya.
It's like that, one two for J-5.
Let me tell you that we, make it live, gray-la-hey.
Breathin in and out lung style, huh.
Mr. Canibus, won'tcha funk it up for a while.
