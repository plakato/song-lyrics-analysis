Delilah Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


Cut you off.
You know I gotta cut you off girl.
You know I gotta.
Baby I gotta.

Delilah.
Baby you got that fire.
Answer to my desires.
Baby you take me higher.
But I know you a liar Delilah.
Delilah.
Sent to me from Messiah.
Answer to my desires.
Baby you take me higher.
But I know you a liar Delilah.

Stolen morals.
I'm baptized, swimming in your Holy Water.
It feels so good, stays on my mind like Georgia.
I'm Ray Charles when you take them thangs off, I'm so loyal.
I'm lusting for your flesh.
I want your mouth, your ass, your breasts.
Anything you ask me, I'll say yes.
I'm singing you the fucking best.
Baby I'm so obsessed.

I gotta cut you off.
You know I gotta cut you off girl.
Baby I gotta cut you off.
Just when I try to cut you off.
Damn your body so soft, got me saying-.

You, you make me weak.
Girl I can't eat, girl I can't sleep.
Can't think, can't breathe.
This just ain't me.
This just can't be.
Fucked my bread up, you really fucked my head up.
Just when I think I'm fed up, we go and fuck the bed up.
And by the time I get up, my whole stomach wet up.
I don't know how to let up; I think I'm being set up.

Got me going in circles baby.
The things you doing is hurtful baby.
And when we do it, it hurts more baby.
And then you do it again, and then we do it again.
Got me going in circles baby.
The things you doing is hurtful baby.
And when we do it, it hurts more baby.
And then you do it again, and then we do it again.
