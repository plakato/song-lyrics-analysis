Ice Man Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.


Ice man.
I got the best ice on the streets.
Ice man.
Other brothers Ice Can't stand the heat.

Dread to the head to the schoolboy.
Skinny jean wearing I'm a new boy.
Find a paw print get a clue boy.
We the hottest on the block chewing cubes boy.
These tracks is ice to the new boys.
We dogs y'all chew toys.
Picked to be the best yes by choice.
Here to cause chaos y'all make noise.
Drama Kid splendid splenda in my palmer.
Chugging down my brothers pills that'll make me calmer.
Pretty soon making bills I'm a shot caller.
Under twenty one and yeah I'm a shot caller.
Sarcasm.
Lyric Spasm.
I'm a Take the game and I'm a ask for ransom.
Won't give it back don't even ask him.
The things I will do will be totally random.
Oh yeah it's over.
Oh yeah you need closure.
Need a little exposure.
To the ice men of the game come closer.
Oh yeah it's over.
Take another look right over your shoulder.
Wave hi when I'm high.
While you still high.
No goodbyes when I'm gone and you still high, I'm a.

Ice man.
You think we cold but we hot hot.
Top notch.
Devil crotch hot.
Got that off of Mall Cop.
Don't stop.
When You make it this hot.
But up here it snow a lot.
But we melting up the blocks X2.

D to the A to the V-I-N.
Chilling in my own thoughts with my pen.
Promise we'll make it and they say when.
Say I'm ice cold but I'm heating up.
Chilling in the Yo and my feet is up.
Ain't doing nothing but the beat is up.
Ain't trying nothing but they cheating us.
Copy our flow then copy our swag.
Then it's on to the next man we off of that.
Ice cold Minneapolis north side that's bad.
Say it's too much can't come that's sad.
Originated from there they say who that.
Me that's where my mom met dad.
Same place that I met Dread.
In a room in the city they laugh at that.
But at the end of everything we snatch the maps.
Indecent words from a decent man.
Back when Andre held Alisha hand.
Three kids later now where he staying.
Heaven only knows can't see that man.
Probably chilling all day on the free cement.
Come around once awhile leave Lil Dre sad.
That's when Lil Dre said I wish you was my dad.
So I'm A Make it for that little lad, so.

Somebody told me they ask you Willie Have you ever lickety split.
You say what?
