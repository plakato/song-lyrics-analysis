Rap Prime Minister.
Some say sinister.

What set you from?

Who's the man represetin'?
Sinister.
You try to duplicate.
But you can't get it straight.
You try to duplicate.
You get extremely.
Cut, cut, cut.
Cut the fuck up.

Now who's testin'?
Rap Prime Minister.
Some say sinister.

What set you from?

Rap Prime Minister.
Some say sinister.

Some say sinister.

Rap Prime Minister.
Some say sinister.

What set you from?

Competitors will.
Wanna go up against me.
Competitors will.
Wanna go up against me.
But it don't make sense.
I'm just too nice.
Dont provoke and getcha team smoke.
Dont provoke and getcha team smoke.
Dont provoke and getcha team smoke.
You just a boy you not bad enough.
To compete wit challengers.
Break it down.
Break it down like this.

Rap Prime Minister.
Some say sinister.

What set you from?
