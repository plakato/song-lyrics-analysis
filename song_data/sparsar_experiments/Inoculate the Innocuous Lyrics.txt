Inoculate the Innocuous Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

Small doses, daily.
Absorbed and collected in the glands of fatty tissues over time.

Somewhere in the asshole of my eye.
There's a muscle which relaxes when you cry.
Somewhere in the eye of my brain.
There's a muscle which makes me go.

Storage cells for hidden substance.
But new flavours and aromas go on.

Reflect on your absence.
Genuflect in my presence.
Remove your absess, they said it's cancer.

Bananas help me unwind.
Watermelon makes it awesome.
