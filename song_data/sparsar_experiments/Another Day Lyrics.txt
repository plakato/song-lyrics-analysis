Another Day Lyrics
by The Zombies.

Another day.
Nothing has changed.
Look from my window.
What do I see.
Just a shadow over me.

I don't want to waste my time.
Watching every crime.
Why don't you do the things you say.
Instead of promises.
Instead of your excess.
Why don't you ever think about.
The love you throw away.
It's just another day.

Another day.
To celebrate.
You got your reasons.
I cannot see.
For the shadow over me.

I don't want to waste my time.
Fixing every crime.
Why don't you do the things you say.
You give me promises.
You give me your excess.
The very words you throw to me.
You take my breath away.
It's just another day.

I don't want to waste my time.
Watching every crime.
Why don't you do the things you say.
Instead of promises.
Instead of your excess.
Why don't you ever think about.
The love you throw away.
Into another day.

It's just another day.

Just another day.
