Zenith Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


It was cold that day.
With a cloudless sky.
As I felt your hand.
Making peace with mine.
Your image blurred.
In a distant view.
Yeah, your back was turned.
But I thought you knew.

Even though you're near.
I'm light-years from your dreams.
But I feel no fear.
It's the loneliness I need.

It was cold that night.
While the moon did fly.
But the darkness fell.
Like a fog inside.
Given up on hope.
As I looked up high.
Yeah my heart it spoke.
And the stars replied.
