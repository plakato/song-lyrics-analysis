Adventure Highway Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Headless they're turning circles.
They're losing attitude.
They stagger in confusion.
Disoriented move.

You're in the game - see the pawn on the chessboard.
Recall your name and do your own move.

C'mon take a ride on Adventure Highway.
Take a look inside what's hiding in your soul.
Check out the mirror 'n' say I'll do it my way.
Yes I will be true to the roots of Rock 'n' Roll.

The dance attendance on you.
They're knitting at a plight.
Indoctrinating Mantra.
Convolution parasite.

You're in the game - see the pawn on the chessboard.
Recall your name and do your own move.

C'mon take a ride on Adventure Highway.
Take a look inside what's hiding in your soul.
Check out the mirror 'n' say I'll do it my way.
Yes I will be true to the roots of Rock 'n' Roll.

Decline of independence.
The game is on the board.
They're bending rules all over.
Just guess who's their lord?

You're in the game - see the pawn on the chessboard.
Recall your name and do your own move.

C'mon take a ride on Adventure Highway.
Take a look inside what's hiding in your soul.
Check out the mirror 'n' say I'll do it my way.
Yes I will be true to the roots of Rock 'n' Roll.

C'mon take a ride on Adventure Highway.
Take a look inside what's hiding in your soul.
Check out the mirror 'n' say I'll do it my way.
Yes I will be true to the roots of Rock 'n' Roll.
