Thanks To My Father Lyrics
by Quan.

James' Dodgers Yo.
, growing up sucked ass thanks.
to my damn dad/ kid born with.
cancer and no damn dad how sad/.
tried being in my life but you is just a bother/ looked in the mirror I look like my fucking father.
/ my friends ask and I try to.
just hide you/ I'm pass hate.
nigga yo two son's just despise you/ I try to comprehend the lies you tell me/ but my hatred.
is what ties you/ our.
relationship is shit on a chop stick a pic with me and you in it nigga just crop it/ stop it I love you like racist love chocolate/ you left more scars then this knife in my.
pocket/ fuck you no excuses.
for your actions all you do is.
smoke I fucking hate you with a passion/ hate to see you smile and I hate to see you laughing.
/ can't wait to see you in.
that fucking coffin that you passed in.

Quan Hey dad what the fuck what you really do to me/ you got my.
mind fucked up jagged off brutally/ blowing loud in my face and told me not to fucking smoke/.
I inhale it now guess who's smoking then/ seriously speaking on a high fact.
the day you wasn't there I put the world on it's damn back/ you think you.
strong you think you can really see/ i'll make you go blind Stevie/ dumb.
enough to think moving was a good choice/ aye dad man you ain't really do shit.
for me/ I can name what you gave me in my whole life/ less then three fingers.
counting down from two hands.

James' Dodgers Dad.
as my logo, a picking up promo/ I'll come and see you net week yo ass is.
just a no show/ smoke weed get.
drunk with fake promises/ i'll.
beat you to the ground with rhymes and my dominance/ talk a lot of shit and stay cocky like cutter.
/ didn't have a dad just.
depended on my brother/ James'.
is the second born won't ever be another/ wrap it up and fuck this game I call it burning rubber.

Quan When I was born my dad played a little game called/ 'ding dong.
ditch'/ my mom was a living bell/ my dad tried to play her wrong/ till she.
caught him like she caught me playing with my other arm/ when I was young my.
thought he was the ruler/ until he had a dream that I was frozen in a cooler/.
no emotions lost new emotions gain/ because the sadness of a boy became the.
madness of a man/ no man in my life to tell me what its really like/ just burn.
shit kick cats to relax/ like bad breath with tic-tacs that don't match that.
come in really small packs like/ don't cry now when I cut yo dick off and feed.
it to you on the slide on the playground/ aye dad I thought you had my fucking.
back/ I'm ya son now here comes the side effect.

James' Dodgers I'm.
back on the track with a ax that goes smack/ attack with pro-bats and wack my dad's cat/ a man with burnt stacks could bring.
yo hurt back/ it's like.
Whitney and Bobby split the dirt crack/ uh, my dad will say but not mention/ he bought himself a phone but can't afford to pay attention/ just listen its truth its not dissing you.
can take it personal but I just need my distance/ hey what's that? its dad with no since its/ time to be.
a man and stop yo ho bitching/.
stop quieting just stand and stop sitting/ you claim that you a dog but you resemble from a kitten.
/ Quan taught me to grow from.
my mistakes its no shit I'mma.
take/ from you for heavens sake's/ you'll probably over wait for me to come and say/ that I.
will conversant with you/ to fucking late uh/ I hope you die with blades in ya eye and wings that.
make you fly get ripped like tore nigh/ yous a bitch don't care what I tend to/ the shit that.
I've done don't even care what I been through/ wanna help us out now don't even bother/ I'mma say it one time I don't fucking have.
a father... Bitch.
