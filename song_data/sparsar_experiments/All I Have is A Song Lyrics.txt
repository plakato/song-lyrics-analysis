All I Have is A Song Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

.
These ol' white lines on the highway.
Lord its all I know.
Seems like I've been out all my life.
But I just can't let it go.
.
Oh you know I ain't complaining.
Cause I can tell, Lord its just your plan.
So I thank you for what I have.
And that's a song.
All I have is a song.
.
I keep thinking about the friends I've had.
And all the meories we've shared.
They keep coming back, time and time again.
Sometimes I wonder was it worth the cost.
And all I've lost.
.
So I play this song one more time, cause Lord its all I know.
I'll be standing at your door following along.
Cause all I have is a song.
And this song will live on.
.
All I have is a song.
A piece of me to live on.
.
