My story is not my destiny Lyrics
by Two Fates.

Falling, drowning.
Lights are fading.
Close my eyes and try to sleep.

They come and go.
They stare and whisper.
Close my eyes and snob them all.

Today I'm gonna rid myself.
Of guilt sense by facing my mistakes.

Two sides fighting.
Inside of me.
Close my eyes and try to breath.

I'm loosing my mind.
On reasons to be found.
Close my eyes and realize.

That today I'm gonna rid myself.
Of guilt sense by facing my mistakes.
‘cause I learnt that my story is not my destiny.

Today I'll try to rid myself.
Of pain by facing my mistakes.
‘cause I learnt that my story is not my destiny.
