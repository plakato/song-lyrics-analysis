Space Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

I made space for you.
In my tiny room.
Made myself small enough.
So you'd fit in my bed.
And that space waits for you.
Not to come but to return.
A monument to absence.
And a heart that never learns.

I knew how to prepare for you.
And I knew just how to wait.
When you finally came to me.
I don't know.
I guess I just thought that you'd stay.
