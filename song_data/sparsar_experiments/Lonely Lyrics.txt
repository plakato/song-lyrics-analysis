Lonely Lyrics
by 3 Shades of Blue.


Please wait, wait a minute.
I thought you had something important.
Going on, but it took so long.
I think you forgot about me.

And I heard, you've been chilling.
With some guy, cuz he makes ?
And I love you, but you love ? to me.
I'm lonely.

I said, Take what you want..
You took everything from me.
She said it wasn't enough.
It wasn't enough for me.
Oooh.
I know, I know, I know.
Oooh.
It wasn't meant to be.

I know, I got a problem.
I'm makin' a wish for a genie in a bottle.
He said, Impossible., I guess she doesn't wanna leave.

Hands up!
Your lonely.
Making me feel like an explosive.
I know I'm gonna loose my feet.
I'm lonely.

I said, Take what you want..
You took everything from me.
She said it wasn't enough.
It wasn't enough for me.
Oooh.
I know, I know, I know.
Oooh.
It wasn't meant to be.

She wrote me along.
Needing me like a siren's call.
She wrote me along.

I said, Take what you want..
You took everything from me.
She said it wasn't enough.
It wasn't enough for me.
Oooh.
I know, I know, I know.
Oooh.
It wasn't meant to be.
Lonely.
