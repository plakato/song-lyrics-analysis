Mars Lyrics
by Wrathschild.


There is no atmosphere for us here, 
We're in a dark place and starting to disappear. 
 
The fire burnt down long ago 
You can't make ashes into a pretty snow 
 
It's hard to hear your heart 
But. The radio goes dark, 
So far away 
Why. Are we letting our love 
Drift into space, 
 
It's like life on mars, 
This life of ours, 
This life of ours out here, 
 
You're, so blue cause the world is red, 
But baby? Why be human when we could be green instead? 
Besides we're so good in bed? 
Open up your eyes. This is paradise 
When I die I'mma fly and this kingdom is ours to colonize 
Planet of sin in the skies. 
 
Run with me, 
Far away from the sun with me. 
We could be the discovery. 
I'Ll lead the way, 
What a disaster 
Might as well end it all 
If. This is my fucked up ever after 
Then beam me up-p-p-p, ..., 
,
