Caller #10 Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.

DJ:Hey, hey, hey, this is D.D. Deda, hello your caller ten.

Tajuana Screams.

Tajuana: I won, I won, I won!

Yells in background.

Tajuana:Y'all shut the hell up!
DJ:Hey, what's your name?
Tajuana:Tajuana from Brentwood! What I won?
DJ:Well, you just won that sixty-nine splat pack.
Tajuana:For real?
DJ:Oh yeah, this includes first class round trip train fare.
And two tickets to Ding-A-Ling Land.
Tajuana:For real?
DJ:Where they have all kind of rides and fun, fun, fun.
Such as the Totem Pole, the Back-Breaker, and the Long Stroker.
Roller Coaster!
Tajuana:Hey!
DJ:And guess what?
Tajuana:What?
DJ:They got three dollars off coupons at Thicken Wangs, Chicken.
Wangs.
And Thangs. Thang it ain't, mayn.
Tajuana:Them thangs sho' be good!
DJ:You and your guests will be staying at the Peek-A-Boo Motel.
On the corner of 69th and West Ding-A-Long Boulevard.
So, baby, don't miss that train!
Tajuana:What the hell? Hey, wrinkle it baby.
