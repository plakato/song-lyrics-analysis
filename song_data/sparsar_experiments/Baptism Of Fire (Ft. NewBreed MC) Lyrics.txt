Baptism Of Fire (Ft. NewBreed MC) Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


My peers been buggin' out ever since I touched mics/.
Call them Mc Disneys' yup, Bug's Life/ what's up doc? /.
Elmer Fudd finally got his shot/ see how deep the.
Rabbit's Hole go, when Seaguls on the block/.
Eat dead pigeons, cannibalistic, sicker than Avian flu/.
It what happens when your friends start aiming at you/.
They say every friend you have was once a stranger/.

Cut each other out our lives, enemies,we create those/.
Awkward, that was easy, Staples/.
Rumours coming at you like 3D pornography/.
Killed the track but no Morgue's autopsy/.
I'm jealous they won't include me now the truth's told/.
The Sun won't set on my anger Satan won't get a foot hold/.
Won't drop names, ain't taking attendance/.
Hope you're in the Book of Life, even just the appendix/.

Listening to ‘Me Against the World', shedding Pac's tears/.
Don't have many peers/ gunned down, except one, Eric/.
I remember how we had fun wow, and I cherish/.
The time you spent at my house, and my aunt kept caring/.
You were 18 and so angry and I was like ten/.
But like friends/ we played Gamecube, double O 7/ Then/.
All this happened just below heaven/ but didn't know.
That you did get your life together, oh splendid/ When.
You moved out of Jane and Finch/ and had two kids/.
Til' it was in the paper, that a cop shot you dead and shit/.
Told to respect the police and may be I would/.
If they didn't kill you just when you're life was getting good/.
Man, what happened to innocent until proven guilty? /.
I know the judge of all the earth will do right, but still, please/.
This wasn't Rodney King or Sean Bell or Trayvon Martin/.
This was someone I knew, now they gone, dearly departed /.

So heres the deal God/.
I'm just tryna survive and keep it real God/.
I'm just tryna provide my son a meal God/.
But its real hard i feel robbed i think i need a real job/.
3 straight summers laid off its no wonder/.
That I'm close to the edge and I feel I'm going under/.
Sugar hills become mountains and mountains are to climb/.
I'm counting on seeking wreasons but answers are hard to find/.
If u ain't looking but I'm cooking up plan of attack/.
Perseverance and endurance build my stamina back/.
Thrown into the fire but his hand is on the thermostat/.
Purging my pride my insides are burning black/.
As black tar as far as tests/.
My sin is east As far as west/.
And this is just another grey hair bout to pop out of my chest/.
I'm still blessed cuz staying under's how my faiths perfected/.
And i count it all count it joy cuz persecution is expected/.

E'lo-i E'lo-i, la'ma sabachtha'ni/.
Sitting in the office, wondering did God forgot me? /.
In the hospital lobby/ so teary, my eyes are soggy/.
Inflicted with intrusive illusions that are refusing/.
So would it be better if the cop would pop me? / In truth it's/.
It's confusing and stupid, cause these thoughts are not me/.
Truths become ‘probably's/ the demonic ruse just taunts me/.
I'll just have to assume that if I fell that God had caught me/.
Went from top scholar, straight to the psychiatric ward/.
Was suicidal, I don't know what the fuck exactly for/.
For all of those with mental illnesses or handicapped/.
If they call you a retard, you got the right to smack'em back/.
My first word was happy, I hope my last will be blessed/.
But now, it's like I take these pills just to get up to depressed/.
My soul's sole goal is to be a righteous saint/.
Baptism of fire is terrifying when God tells ya to wait/.
