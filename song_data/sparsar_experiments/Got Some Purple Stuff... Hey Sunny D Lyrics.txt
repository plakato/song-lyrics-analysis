Got Some Purple Stuff... Hey Sunny D Lyrics
by Sydney.

I've got this trigger finger locked in.
Compressed to kill sound and.
You're running through my sites.
I know I'm always on your mind.
So simple everyone is watching and.
Every second is another chance to turn this all around.
I can say goodbye.

Fight all the pain that brings you down.
I've got a lot of things to tell you now.
It's just pathetic cause I try to make sense.
You're not getting it.

Such a sad sound, such a sad sound tonight.
Don't you dare put up a fight.
Such a sad sound, such a sad sound tonight.
You know the worst part was your right.

I've got this trigger finger locked in.
Compressed to kill sound and.
Your running through my sites.
I know I'm always on your mind.
So simple everyone is watching and.
Every second is another chance to turn this all around.
I can say goodbye.

She took me outside.
Led me to the alley.
Spouted some shit I never really could understand.
I just swear that i never wanna see you again.
It's alright, I'm alright.

I take it back now.
You know i wanna see you again.
I'm so sorry, said I'm so sorry.
It's too late because we're never gonna feel it again.
But you haunt me like a bad dream.

I've got this trigger finger locked in.
Compressed to kill sound and.
Your running through my sites.
I know I'm always on your mind.
So simple everyone is watching and.
Every second is another chance to turn this all around.
I can say goodbye.

It's the final chance, final vision.
I heard she said she's got her problems.
But she's only 17.
It's that final glance towards perdition.
And I know she's got her problems.

I've got this trigger finger locked in.
Compressed to kill sound and.
Your running through my sites.
I know I'm always on your mind.
So simple everyone is watching and.
Every second is another chance to turn this all around.
I can say goodbye. GOODBYE.
