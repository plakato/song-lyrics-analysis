1 Night Lyrics
by Z-Ro.

Sped up sample.
Ay-aiyyyy, if only for one.
Nah, niiight, niiight, niiight, niiiiiight.
Ahh one night, if only for one... niiiiiiiiight.

Z-Ro + Trae.
Z-Ro.
I wish I could have my loved ones back.
Cause I'd love to have my loved ones back.
Trae.
We don't have to feel it like that.
Cause I hate to see the pain comin back.
Z-Ro.
Nobody get killed on the block.
No reason to pack the steel on the block.
Trae.
We can get to make it to the top.
And see my dawgs make it out the cell block.

Maintaininnnnn, there'll be no mo' complaininnnnn.
It's alright, if only for one niiiight.
Maintaininnnnn, tryin to keep it from raininnnnn.
It's alright.

Trae.
I swear, deep down I be sinkin.
The same things over and over they never get better.
I miss my niggas, rain fallin.
9 times out of 10 it don't miss my nigga.
Damn, I hope this state of mind'll never leave again.
I wanna see my nigga Screw get to breathe again.
And wanna see Dinky and my nigga Donny break free again.
On the block, never thinkin 'bout Plix.
Twenty-fo' years of mine I've been blitzed.
Dawg, don't you get it twisted.
Cause 19 years of those have been stress.
Never thought that I'd see this time.
And it ain't no way that I'mma let it get by.
Ain't no lie, deep down inside.
Just to hold it close it wanna make me cry.
No mo' drama, likin no laws.
No mo' jail, no more collect calls.
No mo' hate from these roach-ass niggas.
And my dawgs on the block'll ball 'til we fall.
Plus Peewee woulda never got locked.
Plus Greedo woulda never got shot.
Plus Mello woulda still been here.
With a white Kangol about to body rock the pen.
Misty, then the rest of the click like.
Full speed then runnin without a red light.
Whole life I'll be one of a kind.
Go deep in the wind I promise I got my head right.
And I hate it's gon' be like this.
I wonder why everything come to me like this.
And if only fo' one night I finally get my smile.
Lord, I don't wanna leave like this.

Z-Ro.
It'll be nice to have Emo and Jody and LL back.
My nigga Best and his big brother E. Roy Love.
Dem people ain't never comin back.
But if only for one night.
My nigga could make a decision he shoulda made.
Make it where the situation turned out another way.
And ain't a day go by.
I don't wish I didn't have to miss my momma.
This ain't livin my nigga this just drama.
If only for the night when the storm'll live calmer.
Cause seem like they wanna give a lifetime sentence.
To a nigga with a pistol and a pound of marijuana.
Wish it was legal to be in public wit'cha eyes red.
I've seen a lot of B.I. cases go fed.
Got pulled over, no seatbelt on the shoulder.
Let to a 70 year stand and coda.
If only for the dead nigga.
Didn't have to wait to make a safe walk to the sto'.
Just to get his niggas and a six-pack {?}.
But there never been a cakewalk to the sto'.
Fuck around and see the head concussion.
If the hood decide you gotta fake walk to the sto'.
They fully fronted to everybody with animosity.
Bitches'll take 'em 'fore they walk to the sto'.
A nigga from the Southside, and a nigga from the Northside.
And a nigga from the Eastside.
Could all get along with each other, like we knew each other mother.
No reason to wanna take our own lives.
By losin a son, losin a daughter, losin a child.
I'm battered by life, too rude to smile.
I liked it better when I used to smile.
If only fo' one mo' night.
