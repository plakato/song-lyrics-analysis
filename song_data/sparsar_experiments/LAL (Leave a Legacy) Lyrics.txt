LAL (Leave a Legacy) Lyrics
by Yung Illie.

I've had highs.
I've had lows.
Grey clouds.
Dark skies.
Bright moons and sunshine.
I don't eat no fish.
But stupid trick you can get.
Fish fryed.
I'm outta this world like Syfy.
So what if they left me out to dry.
Lucky for me my sign a fish trick.
So I come out that water fine in silence how a G move yeah you know just we do.
I'll swim around if I ever drowned.
Rest in peace to Steve Jobs.
Rest in peace to Einstein.
I just wonder how life would be if they both were still alive.
What if they had met up.
And you know what they say about.
Great minds I'm let that theory sit on ya mind.
I pouring up they was talking down.
Heard it all thru the great vine.
Yeah I heard it all thru the great vine.
Catch me in the lab like I'm Dexter, Jimmy Neutron or Bill Nye.
I'm bout mines I'm throwing up them 4's.
For my niggas in that south side.
Got my Nikes on already.
Who the hell you tryna check?
I'm take em back in time.
Like the butterfly effect.
She like the way I word it like that.
I been pulling plenty women.
I'm smooth like stealth.
Hit you with my right and left now you blind and now you deaf.
In the booth I never left.
On my feet ain't. Miss no step.
They skippin yo songs no wonder cuz.
They bumping me cuz I kept it real.
From the jump like a trampoline.
Talking that triple H.
Hip Hop History.
Cuz when I go I hope that they remember me.
Cuz when I go I plan to Leave A Legacy.
Yeah!
