In The End Lyrics
by Vision.

You laugh at me for the choices I've made, but you're ridicule won't make me
go away. 
You'Ve brought me to the point where I don't even care 
Time will show you never mattered at all. 
 
In the end we'll see ... in the end, 
In the end we'll see ... in the end, ... ... 
In, the end we'll see who has the last laugh
