In The End Lyrics
by Tycho.

Jason Robards.
Mistakes like this, you don't make.
Sometimes, you make some, and ok.
This is the regret that you make.
This is the regret that you make.
I let my love go.
What did I do?
Oh, and I'll die.
Now I'll die, and I'll tell you what.

John C. Reilly.
What can we forgive?
