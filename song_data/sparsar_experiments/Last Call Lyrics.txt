Last Call Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


I was young and dumb 
Thought. I was going HAM 
Creeping on Instagram 
My heart was so numb 
And I met Lil Shawty from the South. 
She was good with her brain and her mouth 
And I easily fell in love and she did too. 
I was feeling like Sinatra: 
She was like my Barbara 
Boy meets girl, girl, perfect woman, 
Ah, Ah 
 
When girls become hoes, 
Hoes will be hoes 
After. Our last call 
I was drowning in alcohol 4 Times 
 
Phone Call 
Its, not you its me 
I think we should just take a break. 
They is a difference. You know 
Aah Its, not you its really me 
 
Since. Then I don't trust hoes 
Since. Then I'm scared to love 
Cause whats. The point 
In me opening up 

Boo-Hoo 
Getting, so attached 
If we gon na deattach 
And. Starting wishing we never touched 
And start trying to get over. You 
Even, though I will find myself missing. You 
I dont, really want you back HA 
, 
Phone, Call
,
