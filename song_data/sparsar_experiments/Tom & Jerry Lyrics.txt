Tom & Jerry Lyrics
by NuLOVE.

Let me say some shit right quick.
Let me talk right quick. Yo.
.
Smooveness, let me hit you with some smoove shit.
Wrote this in a couple of minutes so let me do this.
Black and white nigga like blues music and cool whip.
Who this dude with no crew acting foolish?.
Y'all clueless. Hitting on ya broad like a Louisville.
Left field, homerun, I just dont know who to feel.
Pay the bills, haters still want to keep a gun concealed.
For the fun of it we run it and keep it three hundred mill.
'Til I make a hundred mill. Imma push the limits see.
Chillin drinking pina colladas out in the Philippine's.
Who real as me? Hennessy, you the only ten I see.
No benefits of living in this city where them niggas be.
Dumping. But they ain't in relationships.
They go and fuck your sister then make an attempt to take to your bitch.
Take your pic, print it on a shirt, nigga rest in peace.
Your sister and her fatherless baby gon' read eulogies.
.
Mike Wallace.
You don't have that problem..
.
You get rolled up like windows in the winter.
Im the center of attention trying not to be a sinner so.
I won't fuck your girl I'll just take her out to dinner nigga.
Who said Boycott ain't a winner?.
They'll prolly be the same one scared to say the N-word.
Look at my wrist and see a blizzard.
I'm sippin on some sizzurp, girl tell me whats for dessert.
I'm tryna be the one that niggas pay to see.
Cater to your table with this waitor flow, making cheese.
Smokey the bear would be really pissed cause we blazing trees.
Tell me what you know about Pine Street, making beats.
4th street, writing rhymes, hope to see some dollar signs.
Yeah I'm acting out of line, balling like I'm out of time.
Oh, you thought new school ran 2K-12?.
Well heres 2 AK's in your face nigga, Columbine.
