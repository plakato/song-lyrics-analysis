Cursed Revelations Lyrics
by Xasthur.

And the weak degenerated for centuries.
To come without the strength to triumph.
Over written prophecies.
For it is you who will die for the bastard's sins.

His curse was the revelations he cast into their minds.
His light brings death, let them die for their belief.
Who is the liar? The deceiver.
Who is the weaker? The believer.
Faith lies in a God never to be seen, as I'm slashing your throat.
Will you believe in me?
