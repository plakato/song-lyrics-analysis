Down This Road Lyrics
by Bizarre.

What a mystic man I am with this art flow.

Buddy, it's all in the family, and I mean family by cousins.
Car started out I need that push.

Take a left motherfucker.
Hammerton tuxedo, home of HKiller raised by lions, tigers, gorrilla's.
20/20 vision make the wrong decision.
And reach under the rug and pull out a sack of bud.
crack addicts, lots of white boys, but ain't no B-Rabbit.
She let her boyfriend see it and we never got it back.
You ain't ever seen a J running with no clothes.
Fuck it, it's a bucket.
Told her I'll give her the stick for a carton of marlboro's.
The home of the purple gang and.
Got a 30 pack of Bud in this Monte Carlo.
Like creek water we harder than a drunk trying to dart throw.
Detroit, Michigan great place not to come.
Chrysler and Ford plant they ain't there no more.
Sold a sack in the culdasack down that road.
And hit my buddy up for a nugget.
Gave my mama keys to a 1980 lac'.
You ain't ever been down this road before.
Blue chevy's big body Regal's.
75 north an hour from Toledo.
Get 5 to 10 and Jackson Prison.
Catfish Billy, ain't it Bizarre tho?
Chevy's in the back barretta's click clack.
the home of Coleman Young.
Abandoned homes, drug dealers,.



Country motherfuckers yup. I got a carload.
And I'm macking this slut who got an ass like a barn door.
Detroit, Michigan where people dont care no more.
Grandmama beat the switches where the air wind rolls.
A bullet's in budget, I'll just go back to cookie cutting.
Mullets in the Starter Jacket your babies in the bed.
And we sitting in a fucking beanbag, on the front porch swinging lean back.
When I gotta have it, blowing that kush.
My boy said I'm tripping, but she looked at it its charm tho.

Red Magnum, Helicopter doors. Big potholes will fuck up your 24's.
Big truck riding never clean that, buckshot signs you ain't ever seen that.
