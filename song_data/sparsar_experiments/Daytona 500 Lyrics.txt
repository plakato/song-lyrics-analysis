Daytona 500 Lyrics
by Black Kray.


Yeah.

Swervin' in a Nascar.
28's on a Nascar.
Got me swervin' bout to blast off.
In my Nascar.
Do the 28's on a Nascar.

In my Nascar.
28's on a Nascar.

Catch me swervin' in a fast car.
Young Russel Wallace in a Nascar.
Trigger with the money like fast fall.
Do the 28's on a Nascar.
Catch me swervin' in a fast car.
Young Russel Wallace in a Nascar.
Trigger with the money like fast fall.
Do the 28's on a Nascar.

Lightin' us up it's a blast off.
It's a blast off, It's a blast off.
Lightin' us up it's a blast off.
Boost Mobile sponsorship on my Nascar.
Raceway Daytona going faster.
Hoppin' out the sunroof in a blast off.
Smoke up in the water finna' blast off.
Icey, Icey, pull up like I'm outside.
40k, passports, Alaska downtown.
Young nigga smoke the purple pass on down town.
In my Nascar.
500 hunna ? in my Nascar.
Young nigga, trigger, trigger with a fast car.
Young nigga count money like fast fall.
Schoo, schoo in my Nascar.
Floatin' round, 28's on my Nascar.
Young nigga, trigger, with a  fast car.
Count money like fast fall.
Got me swervin' in a fast car.
Young Russel Wallace in a Nascar.
Daytona 500 bitch bout to blast off.
Hangin' out the sunroof in a blast off.
