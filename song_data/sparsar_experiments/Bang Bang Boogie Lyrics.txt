Bang Bang Boogie Lyrics
by SwizZz.


Yo, now everybody kept their mouth closed.
Stayed on the down low.
While you was blabbering all your bullshit rapping 'bout hoes.
Now I'mma hit you with the foul flow.
How so? I'll show.
So niggas now know that my sounds dope.
How low, can I go? Lower than you.
I'm bouldering boos, your homework is due.
You posers are doomed, got post at your room.
We coming up quick to cause some misery, headaches and injuries.
The minute we own the facility.

Yo, it's my turn to put it down for the team.
With a glorious lean, stunting, when I walk on the scene.
I might do a handstand, spin 1080 degrees.
Whatever it be.
Hop can you throw me a, G!
I'm focused, no adderall.
Equipped with a bigger sack than Santa Clause.
Yeah, I have to ball.
You're not a writer you're a tag along, loner.
Push me and I'll put you in a box.
Leftovers! Bam.

Ayo, We keep on listening to the same damn rookies.
I hit 'em with the bang bang boogie.
Ayo, We keep on listening to the same damn rookies.
So I hit 'em with the bang bang boogie.
They go!  They go!
They go!  They go!
Ayo, We keep on listening to the same damn rookies.
So I hit 'em with the.
Chk! chk! Boom!

Ay, I'll pass bars but I didn't go to law school.
You'll be long at home depot, you're all tools.
I'll break it down like the swishers in my console.
Lick your drinking water, Imma smack you out that bar stool.
Now everybody here, throw your hands up like a volunteer.
Grab a hairy nigga by his fucking beard, shotgun a beer.
Get up off the wall, See us at the top you're at the bottom like bubble balls.
Tell ‘em Hop.

Yeah, you can tell I'm hot.
When my new shit drop I should sell a lot.
I'm always thinking some type of selfish plot.
My flow is sharper than propellers on a helicop.
Who wanna rumble with the egg that's what the hell I thought.
You dang pussies, get hit with the bang boogie, when you ain't looking, and.

With your brains gushing!
We love stirring up problems, we cause ‘em.
Rappers we boss ‘em, it's fucking awesome.

When you rolling with the misfits proud, you getting hit with the click click.
blaow!
It's a senseless style, nigga its just how.
We get down where we come from!
Hit us up!
If you want some, w-with the dumb dumbs!
Shit about that 818 homie we going hard though.
Only ones who repping the fucking valley who are dope.
We the reasons the planet turns and the stars glow.
It's FV welcome to our show!
SwizZz go!

Damn Hop! Watchu wanna rush a little nigga for.
I know you don't drink but I'm tryna finish Jack and Coke.
The A1A is waiting patiently for us to blow.
Cuz on the low we've been killing since 2004.
F-U-N-K.
V-O-L-U-M-E.
The people love it,.
So we keep it funky!
Here comes the thunder no Kevin Durant.
The Bang Bang Boogie just might leave you right where you stand!

SwizZz.
You know I hit ‘em with that chk! chk! boom!

Hopsin.
