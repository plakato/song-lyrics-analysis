Banana Clipper Lyrics
by Run the Jewels.


I move with the elegance of an African elephant.
I presented the evidence.
eloquent as the president.
Evident is the emphasis,.
I deserve me a championship.
But before I banana clip.
I'mma chill so my man can rip.

Little man against Hellion with the heart of an orphan.
I got the words of a murderer and an eye for distortion.
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit.
I drive at illegal speeds, Keep an O.Z in my pocket.

We run the jewels in.
your town, a quarter.
pound on my person.
I'm known for pounding the stage, I'm talking burning and cursing.
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year.
I said El-P didn't do it so get the fuck outta here!

You wanna hang, bring your throat, I got stools and a rope.
I'mma slang pope,.
haranguing the land with a man's flow.
A new edition to the art of the old code.
That's fully retarded.
and put a part in your bold dome.

Ay El.
We the villains, we.
antagonist bad guys.
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes.
It's time for Skywalker talk cause meet the true Darth Vader.
I hit your mom in '03,.
but a G ain't ate her.
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect.
Before I Melvin on you Jody, put my arm on your neck.
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce.
Be at your crib with your kids saying fuck your fort.
Lil' nigga!

The style is radiation leak at Mile Island.
Also known as Chernobyl talk, listen for the sirens.
For the green I'm a hoarder, you're the poor distorter.
Sorta morbid sonnin' these fuckin' whoredome explorers, I'm bored.
Enough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure.
You suck a good dick for the fame and couldn't resist getting played.
I fuck like I'm headed to war, I'm really not playing no games.
But tag me god damn it.
I'll kill the carrier mentions my name.

Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat.
I'm merciless, I'll torture emcees, tie up both of they feet.
If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet.
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth.
Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap.
Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet.
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter.
Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys, next time do better.
Bitch.

We the old Atlanta, new.
Atlanta, future of the city.
Daddy Fat Saxx don't.
give a damn cause can't nann new niggas get with me.
Now it's true, niggas are simply simple minded simple Simons.
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing.
But what I be rhyming, no payola is required.
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet.
Nigga your lease is up, you're fired.
Quiet, that's how the boss talk.
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought.
And paid for, no neighbors cause I'm sitting on acres.
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom cause I wasn't trippin' on papers.
Or no prenuptual agreement for mama.
If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas.
Eight figures nigga.
