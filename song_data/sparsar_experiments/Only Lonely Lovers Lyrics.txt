Only Lonely Lovers Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.

Emerald'S green between us
Envied ivyed, overgrown
crystalizes
Lonely lovers, left below

Two peaks, deeply distant
We came crimson, crying overgrown
as, we go
Leading lonely lovers. Home

I, remember feathered lashes, hiding eyes wise, fateful no more
Homesick. My heart beats black
Hopeless hollow no for the one i adore

The green ghosted vision
Scales in the isle storms that blow
crystalizes
Lonely lovers left below

I, remember: feathered lashes, hiding eyes wise, fateful no more
Homesick. My heart beats black
Hopeless hollow no for the one i adore

Love me tender. I remember fading lights. Last lit from the door
Homesick, my heart beats: black
Only lonely lovers know what the hopeless adore
Only lonely lovers: know
