Make It Happen Lyrics
by Antonym.

MAKE IT HAPPEN.

This a meeting with myself we gonna talk about pressure.
When everybody around you makes you feel lesser.
Well extra, extra, news flash I'm fed up.
I need to follow the breadcrumbs to get my bread up.
Disappointment stings I need some ointment.
Doctor doctor expectations make me nauseous.
Its like fuck all this, pop a triple coin flip.
Decide that life is pointless or find hope and say i got it.
Well this is awkward.
Our little kid wants to be a rapper and.
We got all this money up for Harvard.
We shouldn't've even bothered it doesn't even matter.
For what he'll do after, general laughter at me.
Mostly from my self cuz when you got parents like Gatsby.
And you wanna be the next Nas or even half as nasty.
You shouldn't dare complain about not being happy.
No, no, I had the art and got crafty.
American in Paris who raps now thats classy.
But its a foggy route to the end.
And Imma keep swerving tryna make the road bend.

Until they stand.
In the stands.
They applaud.
They yelling and clapping.
Imma make it happen.
Oh you.
Don't you ever think that I.
Don't know what I'm doing.
It's this music I'm pursuing.

Imma make it, Imma make it, Imma make it.
Imma make it happen.
Imma make it, Imma make it, Imma make it.
Imma make it happen yeah.

Lost you.
Over time.
Thought I could.
Make you mine, gotta.
Try, not to wait for you.
Maybe, summer will bring something new.

Until she stands.
In the stands.
She applauds.
She yelling she clapping.
Imma make it happen.
Oh you.
Don't you ever think that I.
Don't know what Im doing.
Its this music Im pursuing.

Imma make it, Imma make it, Imma make it.
Imma make it happen.
