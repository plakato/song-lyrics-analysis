Yukon Lyrics
by PUP (band).

In the Yukon valley
Where I spent my summer, past
I was alone in the bush, where
The tide's, slow and the river moves fast
And, oh, that golden temptress
That golden witch
We were on the tundra
In, a land where the sun don't set

In the Yukon valley
Where. You left me
You left me on my knees

On. The Athabasca Delta
We retraced our tracks
All through the woods where we found
A compass and a prospector's mound
And. I pushed off in my boat
With the gold prospector's ghost
Search forever
But. You won't ever find your gold
The river, swallowed. It whole

In the Yukon valley
Where. You left me
You left me on my knees

On, the great slave river
To, the West
To, the West, I'm headed East

In, the Yukon Valley
To, the West

I watched you dying
As. The temperature was rising

In, the Yukon Valley
Where. You left me
You left me on my knees

On, the great slave river
To, the West
To, the West, but I'm heading East
,
