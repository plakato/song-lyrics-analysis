I Remember
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

I don?t know how my mother walked her trouble down.
I don?t know how my father stood his ground.
I don?t know how my people survive slavery.
I do remember, that?s why I believe.

I don?t know how the rivers overflow their banks.
I don?t know how the snow falls and covers the ground.
I don?t know how the hurricane sweeps through the land.
Every now and then.
Standing in a rainstorm, I believe.

I don?t know how the angels woke me up this morning soon.

I don?t know how the blood still runs thru my veins.
I don?t know how I rate to run another day.
Standing in a rainstorm I believe.

My God calls to me in the morning dew.

Gave me a song to sing and sent me on my way.
I raise my voice for justice I believe.
