Alexander Wulf Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.

Me and my niggas pulling up sittin low.
I told ya now it's time to show ya.
Pull up smoking heavy shit.
Hit my blunt now she say hold her.
I said no sir stand back I'm finna pick her up and throw her.
Hollow Squad the coffin fleet will never see a closure.
Boy I get so high I end up lower.
You should hit my line.
She be like Wulf will you come over here.
I said maybe if you call a Uber or a chauffeur.

I'm feeling rather excellent.
I do whatever the fuck I want.
I give no fuck about nuthin' now.
I walk up to decisions now.
Don't know which car I'm driving now.
It's clich√© but it's truer now.
I raise up on anyone.
These rappers don't amount to nuthin'.
He look like he strugglin'.
I pulled up with my friends and em.
Just to come and get rid of 'em.
I'm sick and tired of looking at 'em.
I pulled off I'm ready to start shit.
Aye I crank my engine up.
Now they thought I was god speed.
I pulled off they think I'm God Feet.
Aye okay I'm on my way.
I'm in my coffin like it's Hellsing.
I'm Alexander from the.
movie.
But I don't preach bitch.
I skewer his ass up and keep it moving.
Boy I create my own conclusions.
And amusement and leave confusion with you losers.
You bitch.
