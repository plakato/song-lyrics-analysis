Bang Your Head Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Yeah.
Well, I'm an axegrinder, piledriver.
Mother says that I never, never mind her.
Got no brains, I'm insane.
The teacher says that I'm one big pain.
I'm like a laser, six-streamin' razor.
I got a mouth like an alligator.
I want it louder, more power.
I'm gonna rock ya till it strikes the hour.
Bang your head! Metal health'll drive you mad.
Bang your head! Metal health'll drive you mad.
Alright.
Well, I'm remonstrated, outdated.
I really want to be over-rated.
I'm a finder and I'm a keeper.
I'm not a loser and I ain't no weeper.
I got the boys to make the noise.
Won't ever let up.
Hope it annoys you.
Join the pack, fill the crack.
Well, now you're here, there's no way back.
Bang your head! Metal health'll drive you mad.
Bang your head! Metal health'll drive you mad.
Metal health'll cure you, crazy.
Metal health'll cure you, mad.
Metal health is what we all need.
It's what you have to have.
Bang your head, wake the dead.
We're all metal mad, it's all you have.
So bang your head and raise the dead.
Oh yeah, Metal health, it's not too bad, bad, bad, bad.
Bang your head! Metal health'll drive you mad.
Bang your head! Metal health'll drive you mad.
Oh, get your straight-jackets on tonight.
Oh, the bad boys are gonna set you right.
Oh, rock on, rock on, rock on!
Bang your head!
