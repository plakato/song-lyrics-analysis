Be Like That Lyrics
by 3LW.

Be like that.
Why can't we, you and me, we just.
Be like that.
More than friends, more than we've ever been.
Be like that.
Stop!

Been feelin' this feelin'.
Since we've been healin', I won't lie.
Caught up in good, as it should.
As blessed all of my pride.
Keep up the heads and the moment be there.
I won't blush.
Can't keep this secret much longer.
When it's you that I want.
Can't keep my eyes off ya.
Can't keep my mind off of ya.
I can't keep this love all to myself.
Can this be right?
Can it be all night?
Tell me what you wanna do.
Cause I'm trying to deal with you.

Be like that.
Why can't we, you and me, we just.
Be like that.
More than friends, more than we've ever been.
Be like that.
Stop the shyness, the frontin' and it's all about lovin' you.
Be like that.
Why can't we, you and me, be like that.

You act like you don't know.
What's going on.
To thinkin' of a girl could be.
Cause that's where you're wrong.
It's me, it's me.
Oh, it's always been me.
I've been feelin' you from the dark.
I just want us to be more.
Can't keep my eyes off ya.
Can't keep my mind off of ya.
I can't keep this love all to myself.
Can this be right?
Can it be all night?
Tell me what you wanna do.
Cause I'm trying to get with you.

Maybe you're wrong.
For comin' on so strong.
But the love we had as friends has really grown.
Everything I can want you.
Bring to my life.
Happiness, peacefulness, joyfulness.
