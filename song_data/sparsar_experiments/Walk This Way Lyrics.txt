Walk This Way Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

{*Joe Perry plays guitar riff*}.

Run.
Now there's a backseat lover,.
that's always undercover.
And we talk 'til my daddy say.
Said you ain't seen nothing, 'til you're down on a muffin.
And there's sure to be a change in ways.
Now there's a cheerleader, that's a real big breeder.
As far as I can reminisce.
But the best thing of loving, was her sister and her cousin.
And it started with a little kiss, like this!

{*Joe Perry plays guitar riff*}.

D.M.C. w/ Steven Tyler in background.
See-saw swinging, with the boys in school.
And her feet are just fly up in the air.
Singing, Hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle.
And they swinging like it just didn't care.
So I took a big chance, At the high school dance.
With a lady who was ready to play.
It wasn't me, she was foolin'.
Cause she knew what was she was doin'.
When she told me how to walk this way!

Walk this way.
Talk this way.
Walk this way.
Talk this way.
Walk this way.
Talk this way.
Walk this way.
Talk this way.
Well just gimme a kiss.

{*Joe Perry plays guitar riff*}.
Oooh, like this!

Run w/ Steven Tyler in background.
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy.
Little skirt climbing way up her knee.
It was three young ladies, in the school gym locker.
And they find they were looking at D.
I was high school loser, never made it with a lady.
'Til a boy told me something I missed.
That my next door neighbor, had a daughter had a favor.
So I gave the girl a little kiss, like this.

Run-D.M.C., Steven Tyler, and Rick Rubin.
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school.
With her feet flying up in the air.
Singing, Hey diddle diddle, with a kitty in the middle.
I was swinging like I didn't care.
So I took a big chance at the high school dance.
With a lady who was ready to play.
Wasn't me she was foolin'.
When she knew what she was doin'.
When she told me how to walk this way.
