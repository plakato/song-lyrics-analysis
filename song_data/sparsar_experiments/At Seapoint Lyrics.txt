At Seapoint Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

Swept from home to a place that doesn't call me one of its own.
Time, just like the river, never flows the other way.
Life is just a breath, it'll take everything it gave.
Finding out this isn't you, I went 10,000 miles in another's shoes.
This current has me scared wide-eyed, wasting in the tide.
I'm a healing scar. I have a heart.
But it's beating inside a chest I keep locked.
But the same blood runs through me.
As every other man whose done great things.
I grew when I saw every dream wouldn't come true.
But for some reason I can't just sit by. I shoot for the sky.
I live as if I'll never die, but I can feel that open water calling for me.
The ice-cold current carries us to sea.
