Back To Back Lyrics
by Underdog.

Trapped.
Encircled.
You feel the threat.
You're tired.
You're down.
But you're not beaten yet.
They've got you backed up against a wall.
But you know I'll be there.
To catch your fall.
You're the underdog.
You're down but you'll be back.
In times of trouble in my way.
I've got your back.
You're the underdog.
You're just like me.
There's something deep inside.
That tells you to be free.
We stand and fight.
Back to back.
We take no shit.
We stay tight.
We stick together.
And deal with it.
We use our heads and not our fists.
Unless we're pushed.
As one we fight.
And we win.
Caught and cornered.
You feel the threat.
You're tired.
You're down.
But you're not beaten yet.
They're clawing at your heels.
They're trying to drag you down.
But you have faith.
You know I'll come around.
You're the underdog.
You're down but you'll be back.
Just let yourself go.
And I'll pick up the slack.
You're the underdog.
You're just like me.
There's something deep inside.
That tells you to be free.
