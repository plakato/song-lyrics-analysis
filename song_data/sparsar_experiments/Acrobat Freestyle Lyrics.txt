Acrobat Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


Smoke purp ain't no passing that x3.
Top flip back like an acrobat.

Bow.
Bow bow bow bow.
Top flip back like an acrobat.
Took your bitch you can have her back.
Smoke purp ain't no passing that.
Red bone and her ass is fat.
I can never love her.
cause I am a mack.
All these niggas lame and thats a fact.
Switching it up, I'm rolling it up, hit the bong, fuck yo bitch while she.
rolling a blunt.
Ill be cool and never losing I'm addicted to winning, rapstar in the car back seat for the winning.

Dark tint sitting low can't see who in it but the top flip back like Olympic winning.
And I'm a good guy but I hang with villans.
I just make the call and they make the killings.
Building up my flows cause we in the building.
I gone take your girl you can have the children.
I the only one don't act like you know me.
I'm a bad ass I ain't talking Joey.
I'm a real nigga i could never be fake.
Work for myself i can never be late.
Do a drive by in an ice cream truck.
Cold ass nigga you could never be us.
Man I'm smoking purp you can keep the dust.
Man I'm rolling papers you can keep your dutch.
