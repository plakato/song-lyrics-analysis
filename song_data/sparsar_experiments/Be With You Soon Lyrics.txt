Be With You Soon Lyrics
by Sweet.

I smell a perfume.
Of the talk.
I feel you near me.
Then you're gone.
The gentle warming.
Of the sun.
I hear you laughing.
The day is done.

I know I hear you call in the night.
In dreams I come to you every night.

This venom brainy.
Of the moon.
This time I'm coming.
Be with you soon.
Soft wind is blowing.
Through the trees.
Your hair is shaken.
By the breeze.

I know I hear you call in the night.
In dreams I come to you every night.
