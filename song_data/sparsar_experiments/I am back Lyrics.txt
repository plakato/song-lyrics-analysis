I am back Lyrics
by Vivekverma.

Aiyo ready to put a jack and.
Sit back ,relax and hear something fresh within a flash.
Here zigzag back in a map within a snap to take off these jack.
, to sketch up my best so get up ,here goes the quick knack.
Look m austere and plain so mystique the way i work out theme they critique.
Regardless whatever they say i take it off and inadvertnely i go freak when i.
speak.
But chuck it.
Look at me now nickin minaj ,drake and sick wayne u wanna get a menage.
I apreciate lyrically nas and to the gayb shove u in two car garage.
Here i gotta an eye socket in my loose pocket.
And i am lookin for next rhyme to cock it.
But funny bunny singh ain't no thing u make it sence so stop it.
Fingersnap it.
Abrakakadabra and here i am back to neck and neck on em' wack.
Its slick i can asphyxiate ya within a flash so get back sniff a teabag.
Ur confidence is stiff so u gotta feedback? oh u r a fleabag.
Haters are deat beat and ,i am busy as bee imma savage beast.
Not a faded leaf.
This is VIVK when i boggle my mind, its back and fro.
Look when i get on the mic streches the flow.
Better left alone , standoffish to hoes ,wenches come and they goes.
Standin in a line dissin my foes.
Satan dance on my lips the way i let my mind yack then trips.
Oh jessica back to hop in a streets,get my eyes more than double and flips.
Half of you man get up on the cramp when i gotten my tongue awfully slip.
It just tongue in cheek when i speak ; and i am not a weak.
