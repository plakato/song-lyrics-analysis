L.A.M.M. Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Molly Mary, Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Lucy Lucy Lucy.

Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
In that drag going H.A.M.
I wake up in the fast land, tryna find a tropical oasis.
Holograms in the sand, no vajin to make shift.
Canvass spam this coast.
We bandits, blam this toast.
With a chalice make the most out of callous moments.
When I opened up the whirlwind zone, see my song.
Get back the words but these stars untold.
Na ah we ain't far from those.
Close to home but my dreams oppose.
Yea, androids on my privial throws.
Poison's inimitable.
Moisten my pilot with alist.
To the galaxy, apply that sabitical.
Leisure Gang, yall not knowing.
High off the kush, got my mind all open.
And ionite floating on caramel coastin with a smile unbroken, ain't no jokin.
Ain't no stopping, ain't no problems.
They show up, they could just keep walkin.
They show up, they could just keep walkin.
They show up, they could just keep walkin.
Yea, that's how we run it.
Don't fear anything, so high we're above it.
Please not a bitch, never would say fuck up.
Reason why we stay high? ‘Cause of how we lovin.
Reason why we stay high? ‘Cause of how we lovin.
How we lovin, how we lovin.
No time to fuck around.
That's definitely another reason.
Reason why we stay high? ‘Cause of how we lovin.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Molly Mary, Molly Mary.

Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
In that drag going H.A.M.
Live fast, supernovas.
Zooming on as high.
I just told er say my sayonara.
See you when the ride is over.

Rewrite the moment.
They rose in tonight, I know that's my life.
Standing in the lights like I fuckin own this.
God knows this, what's the prognosis?
I recognize it's real.
Life it ain't broken, won't fix, no shit.
Went from the lamb to the blowfish.
The gold dust down to discuss for my soul fish.
Smoke stick, fuckin shit, that's high as a roach cliff.
Leisure Gang bitch, come and get your woke spliff.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Molly Mary, Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Alice Molly Mary.
Lucy Lucy Lucy Lucy.

Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
Bitch I'm on that L.A.M.M.
In that drag going H.A.M.
Lucy, she's the light bringer.
They call her the morning sun.
Alice took me by the hand.
We went past where the boarders run.
Molly gave me wings and Mary made me sing.
I'm in love with four women but they're all the same thing.
