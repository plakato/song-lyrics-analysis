Broke Her Lyrics
by Yuna.


Tell me.
Is this alright with you?

Not having me in your life.
I always thought.
That maybe I could be your wife.
And I wouldn't mind living a lie.
And still, I keep my hopes up.
While you're out there.
Out there alight in the dark.

Your words, they come so easy.
Girl I just wanna be me.
All the sudden I'm not on your team.
Replaced by the prettier things.
When I see you with all these girls.
I just don't understand.

I guess I'm not like the rest of them.

So is this my.
Punishment x3.
Cause baby.
I'm in pain x3.

I'm just tryna overcome.
The fact that maybe I was not enough.
That the only thing that I could think of.
Is whether I should give up, babe.

So you can be with any girl you like.

Singer, model, fashionista, socialite.
Buy them all the things your money can buy.
You don't owe nobody an alibi.
Go ahead and leave me out of your life.
No one's gonna ask you where you are tonight.
You can tell your friends while you're all high.
x2.
Yeah, I broke her.
But she'll be alright.

I broke her but she'll be alright.

I'm broken but I'll be alright.
