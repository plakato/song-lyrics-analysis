No Feelings Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Don't get too close, you never have to.
To tell it's dead, and decomposing.
Don't slow your roll, cause you're not.
So indisposed by the bulkhead.

You've got a tendency to move slow.
I'm tellin' everybody I know.
No feelings I'm fucked up and cold.
There's nothing to see anyway.

And I'm late for what is gonna happen.
Don't tie me up with stupefaction.
Cause you've got a heart, a really big one.
I've got one too, , it never helped me.

You've got a tendency to move slow.
I'm tellin' everybody I know.
No feelings I'm fucked up and cold.
There's nothing to see anyway.

Cause if you saw it once before.
You don't need to see it anymore.
You've got to stop to watch it.
Cause if I heard it once before.
You don't need to say it anymore.
I got this tendency but.
I'm so sick of just waiting around.
And I'm so sick of just living it down.
