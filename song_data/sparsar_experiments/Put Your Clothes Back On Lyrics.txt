Put Your Clothes Back On Lyrics
by The Undead.


You said that if I gave you the chance.
You'd change my mind about romance.
But even though we kissed all night.
Nothing seemed to come out right.
So put your clothes back on.
Don't you think you should be gone.
Put your clothes back on.
This is turning out all wrong.
So put your clothes back on.
You said you'd make me see.
That true love was even meant for me.
But as you started getting romantic.
I just started getting more frantic.
So put your clothes back on.
Don't you think you should be gone.
So put your clothes back on.
This is turning out all wrong.
So put your clothes back on.
No!
My social life's a total mess.
I don't know why I bother to get dressed.
After all these years of living alone.
Am I just another middle class clone.
Put your clothes back on.
You said you'd make me believe that silly stuff.
That I don't really have to act so tough.
But now the morning light is here.
And I just want you to disappear.
So put your clothes back on.
Don't you think you should be gone.
So put your clothes back on.
This is turning out all wrong.
So put your clothes back on.
Don't you think you should be gone.
So put your clothes back on.
This is turning out all wrong.
So put your clothes back on.
Don't you think you should be gone.
So put your clothes back on.
This is turning out all wrong.
So put your clothes back on.
Don't you think you should be gone.
