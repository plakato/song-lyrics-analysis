Brothers Can't See Me Lyrics
by Quasimoto.


Brothers can't see me 
Brother Madlib invasion. 
Check it out. 
Brothers can't see me. 
 
My style hit you all in your auditory, 
Now adays. When I buy a tape. Yo that shit be boring. Me 
I be paying good money to hear some whack shit 
Take it back to the warehouse and tracked it 
We be moving on you. We up on the night wait 
Stepping over this way. You just might find fate 
We on it. Like a witch hunt, I recommend Astro black 
When you're talk about trying stitch stunts, 
Told to motivate the Digga of the crates. 
Invest ya, loot, Digga, be heard. Every state, molested 
 
I be getting high, keeping it fat. 
 
Brothers can't see me 
Check it out. 
 
Madlib the bad kid I'm, the one that'll hit you with the total bliss
 
Whether extra crisp or mad dirty poppin', hiss 
My shit sound better than yours. I got the force 
Why you going off course like you're, given them drawers 
Yo its the beat conductor ya. I went on tour 
The only thing different is that you see a lot more 
Niggas frontin', bitches, stuntin', 
, 
 Cuz, most ya'll niggas is about bluffin' 
While. We just trying to keep it on A-Stac 
Because the static. What ya, huffin' 
Word to ASAP ya'll need to bring it back. 
Cause in'97 a lot of niggas lack 
 
Album out June 18th. 2013.
