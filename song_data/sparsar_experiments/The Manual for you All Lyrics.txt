The Manual for you All Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


This be ill, you don't know how sour the milk be/.
It time for me to write some lines that just filthy/.
Use poetic devices like.
onomatopoeia/.
All y'all little kids saying â€˜I gotta gotta pee ma!'/.
Then drop intellectual reference on me mind/.
This talking The Shock Doctrine like Naomi Klein/.
Then be dropping classic lines that's legendary Hiphop/.
You can get with this or you can get with that /.
Then make'em laugh and show-off some street cred hardcore/.
I beat up my imaginary friends for more/.
Then I will give a personal experience lesson/.
Alcohol and drugs, I stay clear of it when I'm stressing/.
You wanna write good lines, don't type or touch a spliff/.
Just follow my lead and please, do it just like this/.
The fire in my bones will not be quenched you so stupid/.
So you King of the Dot uh?
Time for French Revolution/.

This is the writing, the pen and the paper/.
This is the fighting, Godsend and a favour/.
Stop with the biting, when it's a lot safer/.
To follow the manual, for you all/.

Then drop names of people you think are the nicest/.
I went to the Drake Hotel, I met D-Sisive/.
I got a Children's book called The Beautiful Oops/.
Warmed my soul like a bowl of Chicken Noodle soup/.
It taught me to learn from my mistakes, failures, and errors/.
But to have learn from someone's else's is even rarer/.
But you gotta get your own voice, King George the Sixth/.
And just know you closest friends are your therapist/.
You'll no longer stutter when you utter get really pissed/.
Get on the radio, declare war on this silly shit/.
What you wanna do? I'm going crazy like Daffy duck/.
I'm going crazy like Muammar Gaddafi better duck/.
Internet cowardly critics, I've had enough of you/.
I'm a student, so I don't listen to the substitute/.
So trace the trail and.
never get cheesy and stale/.
Like two week old KD in the.
garbage pale Fail!/.
