Narcissistic Lyrics
by Woodrowgerber.

Narcissistic.

This is sickening.
All the bickering.
Do they control us all.

Let the world ignite.
Whether wrong or right.
Doesn't matter we can all.

Be so sickening.
All the bickering.
Do they control us all.

Tell me what to hear.
I want to make it clear.
Fear is hope turned by them all.

We could let it burn.
Let it all.

It's all about you.
And what you don't do.
It's a fact this is all your fault.

Narcissistic be realistic.
We're in flames just admit your fault.

It's all about you.
And what you don't do.
It's a fact this is all your fault.

Narcissistic be realistic.
Fear is hope turned by them all.
