Hotter Than Chipotle Lyrics
by [UNDEFINED].


I'm unexpected like Ebola\- rap's new soldier\- I'll have the blood fizzing out your nose like soda.

If you don't step to me I'll bowl you over\- I can mosey over a rhyme so you can't call me a phoney.

I kill these lines so don't phone me.
UNDEFINED emcee I am the one and only.
Take this opportunity to.
Keep moving with the.
Beat cruisin all the way speak fluent &amp; I'm.
Gone by the time that it's blown up in your face.
I make haste while ya try keep up with the paceâ€¦
And you could stop me and try to top me- which would be impossibility when.
I'm dropping these lines hotly.

Hotter, cooler, smarter, wiser.
Hotter than chipotle, cooler than a penguin.
I am better, you are lesser.
Me, myself and I, we are enough henchmen.

If you care to enquire about my raps.
I'd tip my cap cos I'd admire that.
It seems there are a lot of buyers into this down to the wire competition.
But I'm the new addition.
Fresher than a newly renovated kitchen.
Happier than a drinker at the end of prohibition.
Listen you ain't got the required skills.
I'm the Call Of Duty player you Hired for kills.
You better hide the till.
With all kinds of bills.
Cos I've got an empty wallet that I'm.
Tryin to fulfil.

2 bar break.

Bust it, bust it.
