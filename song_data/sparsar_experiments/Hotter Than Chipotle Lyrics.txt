Hotter Than Chipotle Lyrics
by [UNDEFINED].


I'M unexpected, like Ebola\- rap's, new soldier\- I'll, have the blood fizzing out your nose like soda
 
If. You don't step to me I'll bowl, you over\-, I can mosey over a rhyme, so you can't call me a phoney
 
I kill these lines. So don't phone me 
UNDEFINED! Emcee, I am the one and only 
Take this opportunity to 
Keep moving with the 
Beat cruisin. All the way speak fluent
