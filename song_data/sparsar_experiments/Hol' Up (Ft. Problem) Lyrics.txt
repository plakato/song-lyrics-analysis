Hol' Up (Ft. Problem) Lyrics
by Bad Lucc.


Can't check me.
Money on my mind can't stress me.
I stop everything, AP.
Riding through the city blowing AC.
Feeling like a nigga can't catch me.
Ball hard yeah when they ask me.
Bottoms in the sky like an.
Diamond lane nigga so HD.

Hol' up.
Hol' up.
Hol' up.
Ain't nobody gonna tell me shiiit.
X2.
