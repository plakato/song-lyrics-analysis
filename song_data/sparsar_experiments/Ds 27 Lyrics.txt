Ds 27 Lyrics
by Rusty.

I saw you yesterday on the corner of Davie.
You were looking pretty white of skin.
Too jacked up on that Shanghai shit.
To enquire about the shape i'm in.
I was out smokin on a nickel bag.
You were head bangin on a dime.
You say being addicted to heroin.
Was everything but a crime.
I want you back.
I want you back.
I'm going to El Paso.
I guess your staying here by the sea.
Hangin out with your so called friends.
They don't seem so good to me.
Ain't nothin like a phone call.
Three thousand miles apart.
Bad news travels fast.
Just like bad junk travels to your heart.
I want you back.
I want you back.
I want you back.
I want you back.
