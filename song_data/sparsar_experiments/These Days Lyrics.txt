These Days Lyrics
by SwaVay.

These Days i'm too focused nigga.
These days I'm too focued.

My momma don't know that I'm banging.
She don't know what set I'm claiming.
They don't know where I be staying.
They just know my vibe Is amazing.

I know that you listening.
I just know that you don't know what i'm saying.

But This wasn't the plan.

These days I'm so focused.
These days i'm still sober.
These days I came over.
And these days the game over.
These days we on oprah.
These days I'm still fresh.
Lord keeping me blessed.
Still the world keep me stressed.
I ain't even really finna flex.
Lord knows I just finesse.
Up and down on my block.
Big Terrell just got shot.
Now all the pirus is hot.
My girl is all that I got.
Microphone and lap top.
Still harassed by the cops.
Still keep dimes in my sock.
Still investing my stock.
Haha yeah.
Still be growing my locks.
Gold watch as my clock.
These days it don't stop.
And these days I'm lowkey.
But everybody know me.
And every one in my team.
On my back like Kobe.
But my number 23.
And these days I'm with Dyani.
These days I'm iconic.
Coming for rings like I'm sonic.
With that all white like yo gotti.
These days I'm so popping.
These days i'm so popping.
She don't mind calling me papi.
Name somebody that's gon stop me.
And these days so fly.
Looking through my third eye.
And these days I'm still shy.
Big tymers still fly.
Thankful im still alive.
Yeah.

These Days I'm So Focused.
These Days.

These days I'm so focused.
These days still making beats.
These days with no charging fees.
But these days I gotta eat.
These days still on the streets.
These days still gotta dream.
These days I hold the rock.
And These days gotta carry the team.
These days I don't want the fame.
Cause these days I just need some change.
These days on my worst behavior.
But that's all me.
Nothing was the same.
These days still getting played.
These days still flipping jays.
These days still moving weight.
Tryna schoolboy and break the bank.

Used to really wanna play basketball.
Then I heard muddy swim trunks by Asher Roth.
Back then I ain't really have cash at all.
And if I could go back.
I would smash it all.
These days I don't wanna rap.
Cause these days it ain't paying off.
These days I just sit the bench.
Cause These days ion think I'll play at all.

These days still drug free.
But these days they don't love me.
These days I be going crazy.
But these days that's luckily.

These days I'm wide eyed.
Doing drive bys.
Through my third eye.
And these days all my friends is dying.
Thank the Lord that I'm still alive.

Word to Soul.
These days I'm so focused.
I'm just tryna eat.
Like TDE meets Copelands.
My girl keeps on complaining.
She really want me to open.
Up.
Like that's wassup.
But I'm still looking for something to cope with.
And these days I'm focused.
No replay just in motion.
My DJ is Jehovah.
So Jesus tell them fuck over.
No blasphemy.
But quit asking me about all these comparisons.
So I'm gon throw my headphones on.
Cause I ain't hearing it.
And these days I'm so focused.
I'm really hoping.
I really get on this year.
Mr. rookie of the year.
And speaking lyrically.
I guess I'm the only rookie here.
So what's a freshmen class?
Kiss my ass.
If you ain't book me there.
And these days I'm so focused.
I'm really hoping.
Kendrick pass me the rock.
Like Mr. Bryant! Man I'm open!
I know these listeners not listening.
But man I'm such a gifted kid.
And God gave me my gift.
I'm a reflection of what a Christian is.
And these days I'm so focused.
I know they napping.
I'm the only one from Atlanta that really made it happen.
And these days I'm so focused.
Put it to action.
Ff you can't offer me nothing Musically then why the hell are you rapping?
