Sitting In The Park ft. Rex Molly Lyrics
by 4AM.


We'll do it live, Fucking thing.
We'll do it live, Fuck it.
We'll do it live, Don't write it and we'll do it live.

Sampled from Billy Stewart's Sitting In The Park.
Sitting In The Park.
Waiting For You.

Growing up on the block.
Using green chalk to vandalize the sidewalk.
Playing hopscotch one rock.
Elders walk by saying hello to your pops.
Rocking low tops while they're jogging in their Reeboks.
Knock, knock, it's the kid at the walk way.
Speaking bullshit, I don't care what the jock say.
Fucked the girl good but she chooses to not say.
Sipping Tecate, get ready to party.
You know Mom surely raised me incredibly.
She's coming off heavily about using amphetamines.
People will do it but I won't let it get to me.
I'll stick to fucking girls during school pep assemblies.
She tries to prevent it, but in matter of time.
Smoking good weed sipping on corona and lime.
Kids act like being who you are is a crime.
Keep in mind I'm a dime.
And I'm on top of my grind.

Do it all for the ol' sport Gatsby.
Catch me if you can.
Gingerbread man.
If her boyfriend ask we did nothing.
I just nutted.
She push me to the edge, but she don't push my buttons.
Man this four in the morning kid is really something.
He's gonna change the world and he'll still be runnin.
Forest Gumpin.
Beard long as fuck, hair still nice.
Time is money tell me how you're spendin.
ADHD.
Pay me?
Man I can barley pay attention.
I be benchin.
Player and a coach, Jackie Moon shit.
So wild so feral.
This is gonna be a classic like a Christmas Carol.
Ebeneezer.
Blasting Weezer.
Eat this pussy like it's pork and beans.
And then she go down no hands like a soccer team.
Oh shit bro, this bow tie kid can really rap.
He's got these lines on tap.
Food for thought no expiration.
Say it again broken record.
And she's on this wood like a woodpecker.
And she's on the other team, my girl's a heckler.
