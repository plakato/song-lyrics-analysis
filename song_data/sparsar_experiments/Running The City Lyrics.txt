Running The City Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


We run the city.

I'm shaving like a banker with a lisp.
And my chips always crisp.
Credit card the color of Hakeem Nicks.
Oh shit they thought Thought was playing.
I'm just saying when the case come son I ain't paying.
He just relaying.
Post up, fake pass, now I'm jaying.
Be impressed.
Your girl undressed.
But let the kid unimpress with the coldness.
He makes it rain I can make it splash.
Step back with the backpack.
Political raps don't mean crap if you ain't got racks.
Tan maestro give your bank account lipo.
After bones like fido.
Killer for the scrilla.
Cabbage kids patching up your facts.
Jack and Dexter in the lab.
Drop a hot one six make you wanna crash.
Like a RV hardly that's me.
Sick like Raleigh or UNC.
I'm nice with it.
You might get it.
Tell your girl hide she might get bit like a zombie.
My heart black like the jacket on Fonzi.
Chimpanzee business done wrongly.
Watching your funds decay like a donkey.

Heightened existence.
Sky is no limit.
Reap money and bitches.
Running the city.

It's Spiz on the track.
I'm a beast yes in fact.
Mad girls I attract.
Just bring them in the back.
Got them rolling up weed.
4-pack how many homies do I need.
I got Mac with the addys and the tree.
And my attitude feeling free.
Well I'm boutta spit a freestyle.
And I don't even need crowds.
Dunk right off the rebound.
Hey now I'm not mad you hate it.
Or you wanna.
Only drive high on marijuana.
And I'm on them.
Like hair on gorillas.
Like records on killers.
Like B-No-Illa I see more clearer.
As the lights get dimmer.
Serving up that's dinner.
You know I run the city.
So don't get silly.
Triple T Mac with me.
I told you all listen to the shit that I'm dishing.
I ain't even on a mission.
Well my lab is exquisite.
And my raps is explicit.
I'm sorry you missed it.
How up and that's distance.
Get packed like it's Christmas.
And heightened existence.
It's Spiz and I'm finished.
