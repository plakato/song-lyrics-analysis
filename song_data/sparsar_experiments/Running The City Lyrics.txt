Running The City Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


We run the city 
 
I'm shaving, like a banker with a lisp 
And. My chips always crisp 
Credit card, the color of Hakeem Nicks, 
Oh shit. They thought Thought was playing 
I'm just saying when the case come son, I ain't paying 
He just relaying 
Post up fake pass. Now I'm jaying 
Be impressed 
Your girl, undressed 
But. Let the kid unimpress, with the coldness 
He, makes it rain. I can make it splash 
Step back with the backpack 
Political raps, don't mean crap. If you ain't, got racks 
Tan maestro, give your bank account lipo 
After bones like fido 
Killer for the scrilla 
Cabbage kids, patching up your facts, 
Jack and Dexter in the lab 
Drop a hot one. Six make you wan na crash 
Like a RV. Hardly that's me: 
Sick, like Raleigh or UNC 
I'm nice with it 
You might get it 
Tell. Your girl hide. She might get bit like a zombie 
My heart black, like the jacket on Fonzi 
Chimpanzee business done wrongly 
Watching. Your funds decay like a donkey 
 
Heightened existence. 
Sky is no limit: 
Reap money and bitches 
Running, the city 
 
It's Spiz on the track, 
I'm a beast. Yes, in fact, 
Mad girls - I attract 
Just, bring them in the back 
Got them rolling up weed 
4-pack. How many homies do I need 
I got Mac with the addys and the tree 
And my attitude feeling free 
Well, I'm boutta spit a freestyle 
And. I don't even need crowds 
Dunk right off the rebound 
Hey. Now I'm not mad. You hate it. 
Or you wan na 
Only drive high on marijuana 
And, I'm on them, 
Like hair on gorillas, 
Like records on killers, 
Like B-No-Illa, I see more clearer 
As the lights get dimmer 
Serving up, that's dinner. 
You know I run the city: 
So, don't get silly 
Triple T Mac with me. 
I told you all listen to the shit that I'm dishing 
I ain't even on a mission 
Well. My lab is exquisite 
And. My raps is explicit. 
I'M. Sorry, you missed it 
How up and that's distance 
Get, packed like it's Christmas 
And heightened existence, 
It's Spiz and I'm finished
