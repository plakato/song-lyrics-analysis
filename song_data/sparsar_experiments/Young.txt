Is this thing on? Word.

So what we tease hair.
So we wear skinnies.
Were just having fun.
We don't care who sees.
So what we go out.
That's how its supposed to be.
Living Young, and Wild, and Scene.

So what I keep my hair teased up.
Standing out like my skinny jeans, you could tell that I'm scene.
Keep it real with my kings.
Keep it player with my queens.
And we all look scene don't we?
We some real scenes, and yous some real phonies.
I grab my phoney, text your girlfriend, and she jumped up on me.
Confidence too high, I love what I look like.
Now I'm done with your girlfriend.
I'm told your girl goodbye.
This the good life.
Living Young, Wild, and Scene.
Till' we all die.

Till we all die.
Living the scene life.
Just like my jeans, I keep my flow tight.
The shirt white.
The neck ''V''.
A pair of skinny jeans.
Man I'm looking so scene.
Reppin' my team.
And we don't give a damn what you think.

And I don't even care.
Cause if me and my team in there.
Except some scene kids everywhere.
Tell em K-oZZ.

Staying fly everywhere I go.
Ask me for my name but they already know.
Staying scene from head to toe.

X Blake Freeman X.
That's how it should be done.
Soon as I leave my house.
I get my picture taken by everyone.
Scene kids having fun.

We see them hate but we don't care though.
We'll see your girlfriend at our next show.

X Blake Freeman X.
Now I'm chillin'.
Fashion show feeling.
My colors make you dizzy like a fan on a ceiling.
Around your girlfriend, you should feel threatened.
Your a beginner, were some old school legends.

B-L-A-K-E and the K-O-Z-Z.
Living it up staying so scene.
Wearing the hi-tops and the skinny jeans.
And if your a scene kid you should know what I mean.

Scene Boys, Scene girls.
This one is for my scenes around the world.
If your a scene kid and your listening to this song.
I want you to put your hands up and sing along.
