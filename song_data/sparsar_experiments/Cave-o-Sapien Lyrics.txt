Cave-o-Sapien Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Cave-o-sapien -.
You were made for breaking of my back.
As I carried you past quiet houses.
Kicking through the roses in the yard, I spied.
The wildflower kisses on your neck â€“ saw the garden.
Had been trampled past repair.

Oh, Cave-o-sapien.

You look like the sunrise!
\- purple, lemon, baby-blue and gold -.
But I knew it sounded bad when you said NO REGRETS.
And then said nothing more.
And while you're leaning deep into the smoke.
Of those two sticks.
You keep rubbing together.
I keep thinking about how bad it's gonna burn.
And all the people I loved, back home.
Who I loved, and love.
That you turned on.
People just offering shelter from the wind.
So bow your head into the wind.
My Cave-o-sapien.

I had a vision of a gorilla.
And he was a killer.
A killer!

Alone.
In fields of stone.
You're not the sunrise.
You're just alone.

But I've got you, until you're gone.
