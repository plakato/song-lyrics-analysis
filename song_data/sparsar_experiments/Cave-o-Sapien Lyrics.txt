Cave-o-Sapien Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Cave-O-Sapien 
You were made for breaking of my back 
As. I carried you past quiet houses 
Kicking through the roses in the yard. I spied 
The wildflower kisses on your neck â€“ saw the garden 
Had been trampled past repair, 
, 
Oh, Cave-o-sapien, 
 
You, look like the sunrise. 
\- purple lemon baby-blue and gold 
But. I knew it sounded bad when you said NO REGRETS 
And then said nothing more 
And, while you're leaning, deep into the smoke 
Of. Those two sticks: 
You keep rubbing together. 
I keep thinking about how bad it's gon na burn. 
And. All the people I loved back home 
Who, I loved and love 
That. You turned on 
People just offering shelter from the wind 
So bow your head into the wind 
My Cave-o-sapien 
 
I had a vision of a gorilla 
And. He was a killer, 
A killer, 
, 
Alone, 
In fields of stone; 
You're, not the sunrise, 
You're, just alone 
 
But. I'Ve got you until you're gone
