Creepy Lyrics
by Rusty.

Sunday mornin bring it down.
It's creepy here as hell.
You jumped right in.
And held right on.
It took a lot for you to say.
What happened in New York.
I'm not jealous I'm not mad.
I'm comin back.
I'm comin back.
I feel alright.
I feel alive.
Things they change and others grow.
The reaper shows his lies.
I will go when it's my time.
We'll stay friends until the end.
On that you can rely.
You didn't really break my heart.
I'm comin back.
I'm comin back.
I feel alright.
I feel alive.
