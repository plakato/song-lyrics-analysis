Get Dark Lyrics
by The Zolas.


Down on King street.
Kelly's getting dark at the pharmacy.
Who knows when he comes home tonight.
Hot breath, Toronto.
Let's get lost again underneath the glow.
High heels hopscotch the streetcar lines.

Hear the delay decaying.
Text threads fraying.
Home feels so far away.
And it makes me.

Down for getting dark cause the dark gets me.
And all the other lovers make it so heavy.
Takes a little emptiness to feel complete.
When crowds come ever-thicker and liquor it comes free.

Drums loop in my head.
Feel most alive when my phone is dead.
All my true friends are within reach.
Cold breath, Toronto.
We go bar to bar through underground tunnels.
Meet up at breakfast for the autopsy.
