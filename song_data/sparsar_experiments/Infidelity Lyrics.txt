Infidelity Lyrics
by Big Season Muzik.


There was two lovers in a relationship/A very faithful relationship.
They were in love like never before/No matter what, for the riches or the poor.
They said they'll never betray their hearts/Or they'll tear their love apart.

She loved him, he loved her/Act like they lived happily ever after.
The man promised the woman that he'll never lie/Or do something that'll make.
her cry.
He also promised that he'll be loyal to her/He said It's all about us.
forever.
She accept it like it was no joke/They make sure their love will never get.
broken.

friend.

She had a cute face and a nice body/The man said Good lordy, lordy.
She had long hair and pretty eyes/She was the type of woman who hypnotize your.
mind.
She liked him, he liked her/They think about sleeping with each other.
They kept on making love in his bed/Until this love triangle caught in his.
head.
He was like this is gonna make her sad/but, her best friend is bad.
He think about the promises that he made/Her heart gonna exploded like a.
grenade.
He keep on coming home like at 4 in the morning/She be like Where you been,.
what's happening.
He lies and says Everything is alright/But, something goes down in a Friday.
night.

The man and the woman's best friend in a hotel lobby/Things about to get.
naughty.
He said I love the smell of your perfume/They started kissing and go up to a.
hotel room.
In the bed, they did a lot of love making/They felt like they in heaven.

They kept on doing it, acting like it was fun/Until the woman kicks the door.
open, comes with a gun.
She aimed the gun at both of them/She think about killing them.
The man said Please don't aim that gun at me/Her best friend said Look, I'm.
so sorry.
They was scared and she was speechless/In the look of her eyes, she was.
furious.
She cock the gun, point at them/Then, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, at both of them.

So people, here's a tip/Never mess around in the middle of a relationship.

That's the end of the story/It's called Infidelity.
