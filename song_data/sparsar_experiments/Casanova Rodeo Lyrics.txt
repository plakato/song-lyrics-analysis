Casanova Rodeo Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

You're heading south for the border.
This is the site of the murder.
This is the end, this is the end.

Cause this is the day your life is gonna change.
There's no escape, apology would be too late.
Cause you're heading south for the border.
This is the site of the murder.
Cause you're armed with hate and a handgun.
Girl get in the car, I'm riding shotgun.
You're armed with hate and a handgun.
Girl get in the car, I'm riding shotgun.

Dead men tell no lies.
Oh, it wasn't me.
Dead men tell no lies.
Oh, it wasn't me.

But this is not your last forgiveness.
I'm not the one who holds the key.
To lock it up, lock it up, lock it up.

Hearts will break tonight.
Hearts will break tonight.

Cause you're heading south for the border.
This is the site of the murder.

Grab the handgun, I'm riding shotgun.
Grab the handgun, I'm riding shotgun.
We're abandoned, I feel abandoned.
We'll avenge them, we will avenge our.

Dead men tell no lies.
Oh, it wasn't me.
Dead men tell no lies.
Oh, it wasn't me.

But this is not your last forgiveness.
I'm not the one who holds the key.
To lock it up, lock it up, lock it up.
