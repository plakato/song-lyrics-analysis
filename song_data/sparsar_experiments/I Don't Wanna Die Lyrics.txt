I Don't Wanna Die Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

I spotted the glow over the mountain, tonight.
My turn to turn in just when the weather's getting nice.
I predict: I die in a plane crash.
I see it now, I die in a car on tour.
And there's no one to stop this.
Nobody to loosen death's firm grip on me.

Doo doo doo doo I die.
It's true.
Doo doo doo doo I die.
And so do you.

My prophecy is almost complete.
My finger's on the pulse.

We don't wanna die in the ocean.

We don't want to die in our sleep.

DEATH buckle up boys, we're going for a little ride.

Death! I just want one more breath!
Can you grant me one more please?
