Blastin' Fast And Loud Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

We're on a roll, won't be denied.
We've been to hell with back up metal as we tried.
We're drivin' hard the diamond class.
This is our final road to work will be the last.

We're blastin', fast and loud.
Blastin', fast and loud.
And we're gonna sing it loud, yeah, we're gonna sing it proud.
Blastin', fast and loud.

Some things in life you got to choose.
Like are you born to win or are you born to lose.
You've got one chance, don't let it go.
Let total combination be your final core.

Well, we're on a roll, won't be denied.
We've been to hell with back up metal as we tried.
We're drivin' hard the diamond class.
This is our final road to work will be the last.

We're blastin', fast and loud.
Blastin', fast and loud.
Yeah, we're gonna sing it loud, yeah, we're gonna scream it proud.
Blastin', fast and loud.
Yeah, we're gonna sing it loud, yeah, we're gonna scream it proud.
Blastin', fast and loud.
