Live Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

Clear out your mind.
Look to your past and see what you can find.
Stole soul afraid.
Of the prophets perfect picture falls away.

Is this the life that we choose to live.
Or is this the life that has been giving.
Now is the time to see what my life should be.
What is mine!?

We live in Shangri La now!
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now.
We live in!
We live in!

It's a timeless rage.
For many people praying to be saved.
Truth is so strong.
It needs lights to guide it so it can carry on.
I've seen blood on my hands.
Am I dead or is this where it begins.
I feel the shame.
For my friend who put a bullet in his brain!

We live in Shangri La now!
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now.
We live in!
We live in!

I've got.
You've got.
We've got.
Something to die for.
I've got.
You've got.
We've got.
Something to die for.
I've got.
You've got.
We've got.
Something to die for.
I've got.
You've got.
We've got.
Something to die for.

We live in Shangri La now!
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now.
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now!
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now.
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now!
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now.
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now!
We live in!
We live in!
We live in Shangri La now.
We live in!
We live in!
