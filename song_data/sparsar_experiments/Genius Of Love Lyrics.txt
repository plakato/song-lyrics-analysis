Genius Of Love Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.


BizMarkie.

Hey Hey!
This is Diabolical BizMarkie.
And we gonna do it like this.
Rhymin' to the B-I-Z-M-A-Z-A.
And give ya R-I-C-K.
And I'll break ya day.
Super educator in-human or destruct.
I'm here with the X-Ecutioners.

Female Voice.
I'm in heaven.
Who you wit' baby?
With my boyfriend my laughing boyfriend.
There's no beginning and there is no end.
Time isn't present in that dimension.
He'll take my arm.
When we're walking, rolling and rocking.
It's one time I'm glad I'm not a man.
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping.

Who needs a beat when your feet just go?

Who needs a beat when your feet just go?

The Biz the Biz the Biz.
Its the Biz the Biz the Biz.

Whatcha gonna do when ya get a chick?
I'm gonna have some sex baby!
What do you consider fun?
Like some safe sex!
Whatcha gonna do when ya get a chick?
I'm gonna have some sex!
What do you consider fun?
Lotta good sex!

I'm in heaven.
Who you wit' baby?
With the mavin' of funk-u-tation.
Cleansance musicians such as Bootsy Collins.
Raise expectations to a new intention.
No one can sing.
Quite like Smokey, Smokey Robinson.
Wavin' and skankin' to Bob Marley.
Reggae's expanding with Sly and Robby.

Rob Swift is down with me.
Rhymin Rock Raider is down with me.
My man Eclipse is down with me.
Sinister is down with me'.
So come on everybody and party!

Whatcha gonna do when ya get a chick?
I'm gonna have some sex baby!
What do you consider fun?
Like some safe sex!
Whatcha gonna do when ya get a chick?

Lotta good sex!

x3.

Check it out y'all.
Ya don't stop.
Keep on.
The way we get the old school soundin' goin'.
And everybody say.
The original man.
With the master plan.
...Fade.
