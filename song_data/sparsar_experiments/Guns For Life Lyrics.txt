Guns For Life Lyrics
by Wu Block.

Ghostface killah.

I love my heat.
Yeah.
Yall know what it is.
You know it stay hot.
It's a little tale about my gun.
Feel the neck on that nigga.
That's my homie.
UH.

Yo.
A yo I kept the same gun for nine years.
Navy blue Glock in the blue safe right upstairs.
I made sure that little nigga stayed warm.
Tucked him under my pillow.
In case the robbers come I gotta perform.
Kiss him night night muah read him bedtime stories.
Times I just stared at him.
The Glock forty.
His belly stay full and he on a strict diet.
I feed him lead he good he at ease when fired.
Go to sleep mr gat.
I had to do a double for two days.
And this the only way I get back.
Besides changing your diaper meaning your clip.
Got niggas deficating in shit bags.
They're full of shit.

Sheik louch.

Yeah.
That's still my nigga though son.
I can't live without him.
Special relationship with that mother fucker.
You feel me right ?
You feel me ghost ?
WU BLOCK.

I knew him ever since he was nine.
Now he twenty two thinking he's forty five.
That nigga is live.
Like to come with me everywhere when I drive.
Trouble maker same time keep you alive.
His ego too big he be getting pumped.
I told him chill.
He said it's better when you're getting jumped.
No matter how you face me.
No matter where you place me.
Since the day that I was born I ain't have safety.
He went from Y O to staten that's real talk.
He hung with puff he was with shine in club new york.
Now he with me.
He hurt em like angela jolie with them babies.
I raised him up from 380's.
I raised him up from 380's.
I raised him up from 380's.

Styles P.

That WU BLOCK shit nigga.
Yeah.

I still pour liquor after I pop bottles.
Got a friend named deuce nickel the cops got him.
Back then when the coke price was rock bottom.
I robbed a lot of spots with him and im not lying.
Then I got knocked with him and the cops kept him.
I reminisce and get high over a lot of weapons.
Got a friend named nine.
Caught up in the murder one.
I ain't seen him since.
Cause my man had to murder something.
Homie named 38 he popped with me.
And it ain't to often that he's not with me.
You call him your guns.
I call him my friends.
Pop it off or keep it tucked.
Guess it all will depend yeah.
