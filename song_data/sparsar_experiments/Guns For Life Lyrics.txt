Guns For Life Lyrics
by Wu Block.

Ghostface killah 
, 
I love, my heat, 
Yeah 
Yall know what it is. 
You know it stay hot 
It's, a little tale about my gun, 
Feel the neck. On that nigga 
That's, my homie 
UH 
 
Yo, 
A yo. I kept the same gun for nine years. 
Navy blue Glock in the blue, safe right, upstairs 
I made sure that little nigga stayed warm 
Tucked him. Under my pillow 
In case the robbers come I got. Ta perform 
Kiss him night night. Muah read him bedtime stories 
Times. I just stared at him: 
The Glock, forty 
His belly stay full and he on a strict diet. 
I feed him lead he good. He at ease when fired 
Go to sleep. Mr gat 
I had to do a double for two days. 
And this the only way I get back 
Besides changing your diaper, meaning your clip 
Got niggas deficating in shit bags, 
They're full of shit, 

Sheik, louch, 
 
Yeah 
That's. Still, my nigga, though son 
I can't live without him. 
Special relationship with that mother, fucker 
You feel me right. 
You feel me, ghost 
WU BLOCK, 
 
I knew him ever since he was nine 
Now. He twenty two thinking he's forty five 
That nigga is live 
Like to come with me everywhere. When I drive 
Trouble maker same time, keep you alive, 
His ego too big. He be getting pumped 
I told him chill. 
He said it's better when you're getting jumped 
No matter. How you face me 
No matter where you place me 
Since the day that I was born. I ain't have safety. 
He went from Y O to staten, that's real talk, 
He hung with puff. He was with shine in club new york 
Now. He with me 
He hurt em like angela jolie with them. Babies 
I raised him up from 380's 
I raised him up from 380's 
I raised him up from 380's 
 
Styles P 

That WU BLOCK shit, nigga, 
Yeah 
 
I still pour liquor after I pop bottles 
Got a friend named deuce nickel. The cops got him 
Back then, when the coke price was rock bottom 
I robbed a lot of spots with him and im, not lying 
Then. I got knocked with him and the cops kept him 
I reminisce and get high over a lot of weapons. 
Got, a friend named nine 
Caught up in the murder. One 
I ain't seen him since 
Cause. My man had to murder something 
Homie named 38. He popped with me 
And it ain't to often that he's not with me 
You call him your guns, 
I call him. My friends 
Pop it off or keep it tucked 
Guess. It all will depend yeah.
