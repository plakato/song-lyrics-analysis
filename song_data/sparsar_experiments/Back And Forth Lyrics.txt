Back And Forth Lyrics
by UNKLE.

I don't like to be back.
You see things in life.
And you're bit surprised what you see.
Life, your whole life is changes.
You go through changes in your life.
One second you've got it made.
Next second you're down in the dumps.
And it goes back and forth.
Throughout your whole life.
One second you've got the most beautiful girl in the world.
Next second you don't even have a girlfriend no more.
And it goes back and forth and back and forth, you know.
And this is life man, it changes.
This is what you gotta go through throughout your whole lifetime.
I'm going through changes.
I'm going through changes.
I'm going through changes.
And it goes back and forth.
And back and forth, you know.
Never.
Never.
Land.
