DTTM (Don't Talk To Me) Lyrics
by XOV.


I admit it, I'm a freak of nature.
We don't fit in in with your kings and queens.
Now tell me, who made you the teacher?
Oh darling, that's an old dream.

It's so stupid, what you think you're made of?
It's so silly how you look at yourself.
It's so shady, those you've chosen to love.
Forget you, yeah all of y'all.
All of y'all.

Don't talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, nah nah nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, nah nah nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, eh eh eh eh.
Heh.

I'm proud of being an outsider.
We want no part of your shallow dream.
Oh honey, we are, we are survivors.
Our kind don't follow the stream.

It's so stupid, what you think you made of.
It's so silly, how you look at yourself.
It's so shady, those you've chosen to love.
Forget you, yeah all of y'all.
All of y'all.

Don't talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, nah nah nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, nah nah nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, eh eh eh eh.
Heh.
Ah ah ....

It's so stupid, what you think you made of.
It's so silly, how you look at yourself.
It's so shady, those you've chosen to love.
Forget you, yeah all of y'all.
All of y'all.

Don't talk to me.

Don't talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, nah nah nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, nah nah nah nah.
Don't talk to me, talk to me, eh eh eh eh.
Heh....
