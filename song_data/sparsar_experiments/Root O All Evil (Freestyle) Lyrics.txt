Root O All Evil (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Yung Gleesh.

This right here gon get a couple niggas robbed.
Two-Two-Three Ballistic AR standin' in your yard.
Got photos of your broad and your kids do all the job.
And that scoop, I'm a fool I know a lot about you.
This right here gon get everybody killed.
Talkin' all that bullshit like Yung Gleesh signed to a deal.
You must be off the 'yac or the goop or a pill.
But for real boy I still dont give a fuck bout how you feel.
This right here is why everybody broke.
Robbin' all the drugs it look like everybody smoke.
Gooped up to the top fuck up everybody's throat.
What you know, less you got some dope so let's go buy some mo.
That right there is the root of all evil.
Desert Eagle snitchin' clips man chicken to my people.
I'm not tryna rob you boy I'm just tryna leave you.
Ask the shit on my demo man my shit that's street legal.
