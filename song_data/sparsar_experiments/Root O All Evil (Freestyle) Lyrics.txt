Root O All Evil (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Yung Gleesh.

This right here, gon get a couple: niggas robbed, 
Two-Two-Three Ballistic AR standin' in your yard, 
Got photos of your broad and your kids do all the job 
And that scoop. I'M a fool. I know a lot about you, 
This right here. Gon get everybody killed, 
Talkin'! All that bullshit, like Yung Gleesh, signed to a deal 
You, must be off the'yac or the goop or a pill 
But for real boy. I still dont give a fuck bout. How you feel 
This right here is why everybody broke 
Robbin' all the drugs. It look like everybody smoke 
Gooped up to the top fuck up everybody's throat 
What, you know less. You got some dope, so let's go buy some mo 
That right. There is the root of all evil. 
Desert Eagle snitchin' clips man, chicken to my people, 
I'm, not tryna, rob you boy, I'm just tryna. Leave you 
Ask the shit on my demo, man, my shit, that's street legal
