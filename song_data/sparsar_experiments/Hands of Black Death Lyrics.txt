Hands of Black Death Lyrics
by VON.

Hands of Black Death.
Venomous traits re born.
Fear death awaits his call.
War with in mind.
Bloody finger tips destroy.
Murder in my eyes.
Destroy the devils child.
Only in deaths calm.
Hands of Black Death.
Insanity.
What have i become?
Innocence lost darkness reclaimed.
Evil flows through my veins.
Victims are my only friends.
The eyes condemn my soul to sin.
I've lost my way I wait in black.
The hands of death guide my path.
Hands of Black Death.
