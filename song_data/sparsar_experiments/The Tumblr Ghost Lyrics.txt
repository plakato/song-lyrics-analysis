40THOUSAND.
AND I WAS LIKE A POP TO YOU NIGGAS.

ADOPTED YOU NIGGAS.
I DID A LOT FOR YOU NIGGAS.
AND THIS THE FUCKIN THANKS I GET.

YOU TAKE MY SHIT FLIP IT AROUND AND NOW YOU THINK YOU SICK.

YOU WOULDNT EVEN RAP LIKE THAT IF IT WASNT FOR ME.

I GAVE YOU A FLOW ADOPTED YOU NIGGAS.

FUCK A MILLION DOLLARS A NIGGA TRYNNA STACK INFINITY.
OUT IN TENNESSEE.
WHERE SOME NIGGAS GET IT TEN A KEY.
SMOKE BLUNTS.
DRINK HENNESSEY.
EVERY BULLET HIT A CASUALTY.
MIDDLE FINGER TO THE COPS ON THE BLOCK SIX KEYS IN THE CAMRY.
BLACKED OUT TWO TOYOTAS.
SHOTGUN BULLETPROOF THE COROLLAS.
SIX PACK OF CORONAS AND A BITCH IN SOME ROLLERS.
AND THE KUSH THE AROMA.
AND IT SMELL LIKE AMONIA.
WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.
LOAD THE BONG AND IM ON IT.

IN SAINT-TROPEZ.
MY DRAWZ IS BAPE.
UNDERSHIRT IS BBC.
GETTING INTERVIEWED ON BBC.

NIGGA.
CUZ I COME THROUGH LIKE A NEW ROOKIE.
SMOKING BLUNTS.
BAPED OUT.
SWEATBAND.
WITH A SHARK HOODY.

IM LIKE D-BO COMING UP THE BLOCK.
SMACK THE BITCH.
HOP ON THE SCHWINN.
BIG BOX OF ORANGE JUICE TO CHASE THE GIN.

YOU WAS HOT.
WHEN YOU DROPPED.
NOW YOU POPPED.
NOW YOU FLOPPED.
AND A GOD YOU ARE NOT.

EVEN TO THE THOT.
ON THE BLOCK.
GIVING TOP.
YOU ARE NOT.

I RIDE AROUND IN THE DROP.
12 SHOTS.
IN THE GLOCK.
AND THE REST IN THE BOX.

STUFFING ROCKS.
IN HUF SOCKS.
NIGGA I'LL HIT THE COPS.
WITH THE OX.

GOTTA GO CUT THE GRASS JUST TO SEE THESE SNAKES.
GOTTA GO.
GOTTA GO CUT THE GRASS JUST TO SEE THESE SNAKES.

GOTTA GO.
GOTTA GO CUT THE GRASS JUST TO SEE THESE SNAKES.

GOTTA GO.
GOTTA GO CUT THE GRASS JUST TO SEE THESE SNAKES.
