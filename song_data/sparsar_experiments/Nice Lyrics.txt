Nice Lyrics
by Antonym.


These little kids at the gas station.
It impressed me that these little kids was like 14.
And they pumping people's gas.
Instead of taking the money like I would be, that's the easy way.
They pumping people's gas and you know people is cruel.
They'll give you a quarter after watching you inhale vapors and everything.
They give you a quarter for pumping gas.
And I gave the little kids like 50 bucks they was like Ohh! Ohh! Thank you!
But that teaches them the worst.
That teaches them that when you work hard and be responsible, there's a reward.
for that.
And I think that, just like I did that, corporations can do that.
And on a big level you know.
Just like imagine if a corporation just sent a representative and said.
Go hang out in that playground, and when you tell me you see the one.
Whatever kid is the coolest and shares the ball or lets the most people play.
basketball.
We gon give him a scholarship.
You know how many things - you know - cause that would bring hope.
You know what I'm saying? There's no hope.
And there's not going to be too many more Christmases, without hope.
You know what I'm saying? Not to make it just about Christmas.
There's not going to be too many more days, without hope.

I used to be nicer than everybody.
But that was back when everybody was on that playground.
Singing around, I don't know what.
happened to me but look at me now.
I've evolved from innocence to Brenda's tits like wow.
Yeah, you jealous? I would be too.
You're disgusted, I'm disgusted if they compare me to you.
I feel like I see everything and ya'll are blind people blindfolded.
Ignorant Syltherin slice your kidneys out have you crying for them back.
I felt that feeling of making that first rack.
Felt that feeling of making that first track.
Scared for you're chain? No you worried bout getting your purse snatched.
Kidnap the jewlery get that pearl cashed, oof.
Shots, shots, bang bitch I'm coming.
Let's sign Antonym, nah that thing can't get summoned.
Omnipresent narrator editor this a one man show.
I walk a tight one Philipe Petit, but walk as far as man can go.

Yeah I'm that dude who raps.
Couldn't care less for the judge like I'm innocent.
Couldn't care less for the grudge not an inch for it.
Couldn't care less for the drugs pass me some dap.
And show a homie that you got him.
Hid in some shadows made beats looks like Batman's back in Gotham.
Posse possum, got some weasels that drive crazy like drunk vin diesel.
Nevertheless, evil, Evil Knievel.
I got so litterary it's scary.
So many books in the bag it's hard to carry.
What happened? What happened?

\-- Tribe Sounds --.

Somebody messed up the test tubes.
She got them pressed-up laminated plastic.
Just for sex boobs, I ain't about just making out in the restroom.
I ain't shaving shit this girl deserves my fucking best pubes.
Confess to who, dress up like the preist I know all your secrets.
Check yourself, your history, and who sees it.
I read it, I read it.
I read it, I read it.
