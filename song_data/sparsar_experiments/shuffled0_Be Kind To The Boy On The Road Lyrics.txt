Be Kind To The Boy On The Road Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

Your policeman discourages that boy on the highway.
Are the men who gave up their homes!

Ain't the bee that hands around the hive.
Don't point your finger at that boy on the highway.
You might think he's wrong standing there on that highway.
Cause he's got all the trouble that he wants!
Remember the men that wrote your Bible.
Why does he roam alone?
If you'd had his troubles on your hands.
O' what a foolish young lad!
But the best way to help that boy on the highway.
I've heard it said 'bout rolling stone boys.
Oh be kind to that boy on that white winding highway.
But you yourself might be standing on that highway.
Either give him your help or pass him with kindness.

They gather no moss in their life?
Is he looking for life on that white winding highway?
Is to fix all your troubles there at home!

For his parents dealt him trouble at home.
As you travel on there alone.
As you travel down this road!



Who is that boy on the white winding highway?
It's heard everywhere that he goes!
I'll tell you the bee that gets the honey.
