The Verb Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

What's the verb to.
Cut it off to.
Take a knife and hack away at it.
You keep saying.
Well that's the last time.
You'll pretend to.
Stand aside no matter what we did.
I'm not playing.
All in all they're.
Just enough to.
Keep us sliding back to where we were.
I'm not waiting.
That's the last time.
You get friends who.
Will tell you that you walked away with it.
And you barely scrape through.

I'm tired of fighting she said.
Your words just rattle my head.
All joy escapes in the dark.
And I can't make this make sense.
Your words are lost to me now.
I cannot take it, I'm out.
I'm stuck here kidding myself.
Cause you're out there caring somewhere.

So what's the verb to.
Kick it over.
Take the time and walk away from it.
I'm not playing.
That'll never.
Sit with us well.
We're far too pious to get out of it.
And we're on our way.

I'm tired of fighting you said.
Your words just rattle my head.
All joy's escaped in the dark.
And I can't make this make sense.
Your thoughts are lost to me now.
I cannot take it, I'm out.
I'm stuck here kidding myself.
You're out there drinking somewhere.

I'm sorry I've lost all my hope.
I cannot take it no more.
I'm stuck here kidding myself.
You're out there laughing somewhere.
I tore my heart out, no more.

I'm stuck here kidding myself.
And you're out there laughing somewhere.
This joy is lost to me now.
I cannot take it, I'm out.
I'm stuck here kidding myself.
And you're out there drinking somewhere.

I'm stuck here kidding myself.
