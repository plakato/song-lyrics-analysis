{*breathing like Darth Vader*}.
The next selection is.. bass filled...
Musical compisition, entitled...
Microphone Techniques...
Please check it out...

Greg Nice.
Get up everybody, it's time to sway OK.
Greg Nice is on the mic with no delay.
Get up everybody, it's time to sway OK.
Greg Nice is on the mic with no delay.
She, said, her name was Lola.
I, said, yo Lola, swolla.
Suave bola, Ayatollah.
Saudi Arabia, Coca-Cola.
My Rolex watch is ran by solar.
Get down, peep my mic technique.
Let's freak let's freak let's freak to the beat.
Checks get cashed, at the end of the weak.
C'mon, Deck the Halls with skins and party.
Gainin weight cause I do eat hearty.
When I wanna get tipsy I drink Bacardi.
Greg Nice, I'm outta here, ghost!

I'm on the microphone...

Pete Nice.
Uncle Fester, the baldhead jester.
Not me, the Minister, the mic molestor.
Five-oh arrest a G, doin ill deeds.
Took a ho to pull out the weeds.
Droppin G, the case court is to hobos.
Kickin the bobo, chewin on a Rolo.
Ain't a Volvo with no paid promos.
Sippin cocoa and rollin up momos.
Fee fie foe fum I need awake drums.
The buns ain't mack cause your breath hums.
No Funky Drummer loser pass summons.
But you can't stop the +Humrush+ hummings.
Like Roto Rooter layin pipes like a plumber.
Nice and Smooth cause Three's a prime number.
I go brick church buildin when I'm sleepin.
So flip off my tip, I rip the mic techniquein.

I'm on the microphone...

Smooth B.
I praise the Lord that I'm no longer a vandal.
Kiss my daughter goodnight, then I light a white candle.
And sit back and meditate.
Evaluate, appreciate.
Cause I didn't have to be here, on wax.
Unveling a truth with proof of all facts.
Cause in my life I see the life of many others.
Various shades of colors, sisters brothers.
And once my soul leaves my bodily shell.
I believe to receive a new vail.
Of some concious subconcious abode.
Chose by few on the positive road.
A man is judged by the goodness of his heart.
So who's to say who's dumb and who's smart?
Aiyyo Serch  I came to hear you speak.
Get on the mic and flaunt your microphone technique.

I'm on the microphone...

MC Serch.
Watch me shine til it's time for sundown.
I had a scuffle with a kid it only went one round.
I got a girl so there's no need to sex a ho.
But I gas em up just like they're at Texaco.
Ring goes my phone, so I pick it up and say, Whattup?
Somebody's flippin, so I tell him to shut up.
We'd use a F word, but Ice Cube got the copyright.
So I'll make it +Funky For You+ with Greg Nice.
And his partner Smooth B.
Watch the Superbowl, just for Bud Bowl III.
Then I watch Living Colour, cause Homey don't play dat.
Money like my honey in my crib and it'll stay that way.
The equality variety.
You don't like it then you're gonna join the Dead Poet's Society.
Try to flip on what this quartet speaks.
And Serch will disperse, the microphone techniques.

* discussion by the crew over the beat until the end *.
