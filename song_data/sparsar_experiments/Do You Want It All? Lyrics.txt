Do You Want It All? Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

We're low in our hearts.
We're low in our heads.
All in good time.

Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?

We're low in our hearts.
We're low in our heads.
All in good time.

All will take charge.
We'll all take our chances.
All in good time.

Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?

Break.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
