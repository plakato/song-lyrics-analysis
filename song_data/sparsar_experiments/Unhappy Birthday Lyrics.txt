Unhappy Birthday Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.

Go Mody, It's your birthday.
Tena Jones is the only girl I want.
We have a son he looks just like me.
She's so fly she don't have to flaunt.
From the south she cooks just right, see.
Last night she got upset, she left.
From the way it looks she might be gone.
I love her though, I love her though, I love her though, I love her so.

Baby with you gone.
I won't enjoy the food.
I won't enjoy the music or the songs.
I need you home.
I'm just not in the mood.
I won't enjoy my party all alone.

Happy birthday to ya.
To me it's just another day.
If my baby ain't with me singing.
Happy birthday to ya.
It's really just another day.

She walked out I was so surprised.
With my son who looks just like me.
Very upset at me rolled her eyes.

I'm so wrong she is so divine.
Apologized but she still might be gone.
I love her though, I love her though, I love her though, I love her so.

Baby with you gone.
I won't enjoy the food.
I won't enjoy the music or the songs.
I need you home.
I'm just not in the mood.
I won't enjoy my party all alone.

Happy birthday to ya.
To me it's just another day.
If my baby ain't with me singing.
Happy birthday to ya.
It's really just another day.

Everyday sunshine since we got together.
Partners like John and Pauncherella.
You sweet like chocolate dipped in vanilla.
Cold when I'm alone but we hot forever.

Wait bro.
Really do appreciate it but it's late though.
Still upset at how you treated me don't make no sense.
You got me tense.
I'm princess you prince or I'm out the fence.

Baby with you gone.
I won't enjoy the food.
I won't enjoy the music or the songs.
I need you home.
I'm just not in the mood.
I won't enjoy my party all alone.

Happy birthday to ya.
To me it's just another day.
If my baby ain't with me singing.
Happy birthday to ya.
It's really just another day.

Don't even care.
I love you but you do me wrong.
So what if it's your birthday.
Boy you better treat me right.
Love you shouldn't do me wrong.
That's why I missed your birthday.

Happy birthday.
