All Night Long Lyrics
by SWV.


Baby.
You can call on me.
Anytime that you feel the need.
And I'll be there in a hurry.
Givin you the best of me.
And baby, you know.
I keep it nice and warm to satisfy.

Baby, you know that.
I am always hot for you.
And if there's any kinda love.
That will exemplify.
My sweetie.
I have got that kinda love times two.

Boy.
I'll do you all night long.
Do you anyway you want.
I will do you all night long.

I wanna please you.
Don't wanna tease you.
You can melt in my body.
And I will slowly melt onto you.

Caress your face in my valley.
Let me feel the sweetness of you.
And baby, you know.
I keep it special each and every time.
I never do nothing once.
And never quite the same.

And baby, you know.
If there is anything you want from me.
I will supply.
So you can have it your way.

Here's the vibe.
There's candlelight.
As I undress for you, baby.

A sip of wine.
We take our time.
Then I undress you too.

I look at you.
You look at me.
And then we both embrace.
And then we just let nature take its place.
