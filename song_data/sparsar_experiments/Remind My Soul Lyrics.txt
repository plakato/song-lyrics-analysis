Remind My Soul Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


Remind me why my passion's still worth it 
It starts to seem like it's not working 
And, I'm not certain that I've put enough work in 
Thoughts lurking hit me in my person. 

You could never be for certain if I'm hurting 
I could never let you close enough to scratch the surface 
Cause. I'M observing that this jungle's full of serpents 
Just searching steady, hissing 
Wish. It was different 
But once reality wraps around your neck 
And. You feel your last breath 
You begin to second guess. If you made the right steps in the grass 
I'm blessed that I pass through 
Life like knifes ain't attached to my back dude 
And lately that Wu been telling me that cash rules 
And. If that's true, then we doomed til the last moon, 
It's, sad dude. When I hear that click clack boom 
He, probably wasn't even a bad dude. Sad news, 
And that news tryna tell me how to view things. 
Gang hits and school
shootings are not new things. 
Tryna show the people what you bring 
But. If they got your minds in shoe strings, I got a loose string 
Cause. Nowadays, that's just how you got ta. Do things 
When they using that eye in the sky to view things 
And, the ones who think are the ones to sink slowly, 
I try to appear holy 
But, the devil scopes me and tries to provoke me 
Hopefully. He never gets too close to me. 
Because. I'Ve got the dopest dreams and need Jehovah holding me 
And. Lately a couple people been approaching me 
Saying that they heard my voice and there's still hope for me 
Sulk when I see chains, so my soul will not be tamed. 
Hip Hop call it what you want, but it's not a game. 
We all tryna make it, but our goals are not the same 
Soulless world remind my soul that I'm not the same 
I know I'm not the same. I swear I'm not the same. 
At least, I hope I'm the same, because if I'm the same 
Then nothing's stopping this world from driving my mind insane 
It drives my mom insane 
Riding in that driving lane 
Crowding my mind and now I'm swerving 
My, God has got ta. Save 
God has got a way of guiding those who got the faith 
But. I ain't sure I got the faith, that's why I got ta pray. 
I got ta find a way to survive until my final day 
So, you can sleep, but no, I'm not I'm staying wide awake 
Until that scythe swing I'mma keep fighting 
And. Keep writing. All I need is the right guiding 
That light's shining 
,
