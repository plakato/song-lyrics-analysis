Used To Love You Lyrics
by Yuna.


I wonder if you think about me.
Now that you're out there on your own.
You made it seem so easy.
I wanna be just like you.
I wonder if your heart is healing.
You're going out so often now.
I see the boys are helping you out.
Are they just like you?

No regrets, no looking back now.
Never left, you let me back down, no, no, no.

Used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I'm better than before.

I can never understand why.
I'm depending on a guy.
To make me feel like I was special.
I am special when I'm mine.
Keep running on in circles.
I was such a slave for love.
Now that I know better, I know better of my worth.
I was young and I was foolish.
Giving up my heart so easy to someone who didn't love me like I do.
I was young and I was foolish.
All I needed was my spirit and someone will come and love me like I do.

No regrets, no looking back now.
Never left, you let me back down, no, no, no.

Used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I'm better than before.

Used to love you.
I used to love you.
Used to love you.
Used to love you.
Used to love you.

Used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I used to love you, used to care.
But no more.
I'm better than before.
