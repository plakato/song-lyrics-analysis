Hourglass (Prod. by MetaMorph) Lyrics
by Ry.


I speak for the people, so I speak for liberty.
But still try to speak for versatility.
Trying to bring the clique down with all the negativity.
But i'mma take the game out like a bad cavity.
And make you feel it like a kick to your chest cavity.
Everybody overlook me part of a tragedy.
But I rule like the British majesty.
On my high horse like Polo &amp; just so you know so.
Guarantee i'll capture the picture like a Polaroid.
Ya'll raps is Corduroy.
Simultaneously they softer than Corduroy.
Ambition strong like Arnie Schwarz on ster-i-oids.
Stereo knocker, animal like Chubaka.
With these letters scar face like the brother of Mufasa.
But I'm the big brother, ironically ya'll watching me.
Eleven minute green light, there ain't no stopping me.

As time just pasts it's feeling like an hourglass.
Swear on my soul that it's moving fast.
If life's a game, I hope I do not crash.
Just want perfect timing like an hourglass.
Looking at the time drop, where's it going?
Painful as the brain with the beauty like it's snowing.
But I'm knowing, time is running thin - I can't claim it.
So I better take it now before it's too late to save it.
Oh where are we going? Where are we going?
Where are we going?

Over the last year music's taking over my life.
Completely reciprocal, I'm giving back life.
When I direct these rhymes like Hype.
I start to get excited like an abusive hype.
I'm over them but I'm never over-hyped.
But drastically under-rated.
Still have a few who fell in love with this capturing cadence.
Feeling like Dougie Howser, eventually running out of patience.
And maybe that's when others minds will embrace this.
Flow like an island cause I live behind these San Quentin Bars.
Galactica when I shoot for these stars.
Never resting when ya'll were pressing bitches.
I was bench pressing, working out on the mic.
Up late each and every night.
For the opportunity to sleep at night.
And if I'm lying, Wesley Snipes was born half white.

As time just pasts it's feeling like an hourglass.
Swear on my soul that it's moving fast.
If life's a game, I hope I do not crash.
Just want perfect timing like an hourglass.
Looking at the time drop, where's it going?
Painful as the brain with the beauty like it's snowing.
But I'm knowing, time is running thin - I can't claim it.
So I better take it now before it's too late to save it.
Oh where are we going? Where are we going?
Where are we going?

Everybody got bars.
But the difference is that my bars got bars.
And those bars got bars.
And the children of those bars are hard.
Do I gotta spell it for you retards?
Who couldn't smoke a lit cigar.
I been grinding hard so I'm coming soon like hard grinding.
Never going back, no time for rewinding.
Good things come in 3's like sides on an island.
So it's me, Steve, and Jae The Dream.
Make sure they score like they beat a double team.
Young and learning life ain't exactly what it seems.
Time just flying and things steady changing.
Like a confused youth who don't know what gang he banging.

As time just pasts it's feeling like an hourglass.
Swear on my soul that it's moving fast.
If life's a game, I hope I do not crash.
Just want perfect timing like an hourglass.
Looking at the time drop, where's it going?
Painful as the brain with the beauty like it's snowing.
But I'm knowing, time is running thin - I can't claim it.
So I better take it now before it's too late to save it.
Oh where are we going? Where are we going?
Where are we going?
