Analogue (All I Want) Lyrics
by A-ha.

Come back, my darling one.
I'm calling on you.
The road ahead is long.
And I must warn you.

I wonder.
Where did she go?
If I failed you.
I tell you right now.

All I want you to know.
I love you.
All I need is the time.
To show you.

Come back, my fallen son.
Don't let them fool you.
Cause when the day is done.
They never move you.

Lay down your sense of pride.
Got more than you.
Put out your mournful tones.
I tell you right now.

All I want you to know.
I love you.
All I need is the time.
To show you how I feel, feel.

Lay down your sense of pride.
Trampled once too often.
I tell you right now.

All I want you to know.
I love you.
All I need is the time.
To show you.

Oh yeah.
You know I love you.
All I need is the time.
To show you how I feel.
