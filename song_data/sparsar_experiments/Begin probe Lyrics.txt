Begin probe Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Caught our first fish, just to watch it wriggle.
Guts and gills and dollar bills to catch all of the useless parts.
Fifth high school reunion, we had a chance to catch up.
Glad to see you're doin' well still can't wash off that smell.

Begin probe.
Where's it go?
You should know.
Up the rear.
You're on a roll.
And it feels so good, yeah.

Just dropped by to see if your resolve is as weak as mine.
No surprise, first class got the ticket away from me.
We get better but you know it's a trick.
No contestant when you don't give a shit about it.
I'll make it one more minute if it's the last thing I do.
Who said there would be no harm in saying that to you.
