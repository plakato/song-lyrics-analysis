Danger Zone Lyrics
by Zion I.


Ain't nothing been changed, killer.
Hands still gripping on grains, killer.
Fast life too strange, killer.
Had to slow down to maintain, killer.
Got dreams, we the same, killer.
Saying everybody need change, killer.
Think smart, use your brains, killer.
They're doing everything, use your skrill to kill you.
Sit down and get thanks, filler.
Conquering line like a seller.
Monday, case break, filler.
Tryin' to spread love all day, hiller.
Straight out that gate, filler.
Been the whole day on faith, riller.
Waste too much time with the bassline.
G.O.D., yeah, I need face time.
Skype me in.
Opportunity strike like lightning and.
At it again, let me go in.
And I'm high off chi and oxygen.
Where the G's at? Where the queens at?
It's for the people, please believe that.
Straight up blessed, heart on my sleeve, I tore it out my chest.

When you're in the danger zone.
And light will lead you on.
You're in the danger zone.
Their light will lead you on.

You're in the danger zone.
I gotta take us home.
We're in the danger zone.
You'll never lead us on.

Still the same OG.
Fellas, sun still shine on me!
Fella, tattoo on lane, fella.
Is she putting on my team? Fella.
Shorty look fly, bella.
Zion-I tell no lie, ella.
Can't say I'm about to eat ten.
Feel good put the verbs on the imprint.
Hit ten, call them pops.
I'm a real cool guy, I don't like the law though.
Make them, I'mma break 'em in.
I'd rather live my life many causes in.
Meditate and elate the light then.
Pretty soon you be taking flight in.
And that's all of y'all.
To the irie heights we call Heaven's ball.
