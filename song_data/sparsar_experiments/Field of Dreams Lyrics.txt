Field of Dreams Lyrics
by Sweetness.


Uh yea.. 
Come take a ride with me, 
To a place that I call paradise 
My field of dreams. 
It goes a little likeâ€¦ 
Penthouse dreams of looking out from inside the tallest tower. 
I'Ve always been about grinding hard like Rocket Power. 
The lifestyle. That'S perfect! I think my people and I deserve it: 
Custom suits to exclusive shoes. 
Stayin fly like Howard Hughes, 
Look into the closet, and it never ends 
The story of Mr. Best Dressed and all his friends 
Tonight we're going out, and tomorrow we gon na. Do it again, 
Eatin' Filet, Mignon and poppin' bottles of Dom 
Leave the waitress our number cause she's a bomb 
But by the time she reads it. We will be long gone 
Like that basketball team from Harlem travellin' across the Earth, 
To different societies that see a man by his values and not by his worth 
Never worry about the weather. I can change it 
Hop up in this car. I can show you why I call it my spaceship 
European for the week and muscle for the weekends 
Going as fast as we want. No cops waitin at the street ends 
No more wrecks. No more. I wished, I could have said goodbyes 
No, drunk drivers to take lives, 
Just me and my boys, settling down with the most beautiful of wives, 
A love that grows old and gets gray with us, 
And, no sickness to take them away from us. 
And. The only Cancer known is the Zodiac sign 
So, let's dine
