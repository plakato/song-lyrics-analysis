Battles Lyrics
by The Virus.

Choices that we make.
And paths that we choose.
Define just what we are.
The battles that we won.
And the battles we've fought so far.
These will remember.
Whether they are memories or scars.
Cause no matter what we've won.
And no matter what we've lost.
It' won't change what we are.

Cause even through the worst times.
Even through the bad times.
We survived the battles that we fought.
And it's f**ked up thing but it isn't everything.
We survived the battles that we fought.

All the fights all the losses all the wins.
It don't really matter.
All the highs and all the lows, all the shit.
It don't f**king matter.
Just the fact that we fight through thick and thin.
Is what really matters.
Just the fact that we fight and don't give in.
Is what f**king matters.

Cause even through the worst times.
Even through the bad times.
We survived the battles that we fought.
And it's f**ked up thing but it isn't everything.
We survived the battles that we fought.

Choices that we make.
And paths that we choose.
Define just what we are.
The battles that we won.
And the battles we've fought so far.
These will remember.
Whether they are memories or scars.
Cause no matter what we've won.
And no matter what we've lost.
It' won't change what we are.

Cause even through the worst times.
Even through the bad times.
We survived the battles that we fought.
And it's f**ked up thing but it isn't everything.
We survived the battles that we fought.
