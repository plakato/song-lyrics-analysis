GTA 5 Eminem Berzerk Parody Lyrics
by Xpertthief.


Trevor's getting pissed off but we're used to that.
And Franklin is the driver got Chop in the back.
Michael's aim you can't match up his shots do not lack.
That's why your dead on the ground won't get up after tha-aat.
Yes i just robbed an old lady because I'm crooked.
Equipped my grenades it's time to cook it.
They here the sirens &amp; shots so they be looking.
Couldn't give back the wallet instead I took it.
Time to make like a novel you see me book it.

Let's bring back to the crib and stack it.
Free roaming all night.
&amp; Doing whatever we like.
&amp; I don't mean that song by T.I. bish.
We been playing GTA since the view was bird's eye bish.

Bike ridding, mountain climbing, sky diving in GTA.
Pistol Popping, bodies dropping, strip club hopping, in GTA.
We're gonna play this game until we go insane.
&amp; that will never change, all night 'til the A.M.
Driving, crazy gang violence, here we go, here we go.
Stick 'em up, get money or handcuffed.
Robbing stores so I'm never broke.
Everybody, in the game, go berezerk, let go your vinyles.

See the girls like the way that I'm dressed up.
Button pressed punch to the face now you messed up, now what.
Poppin in to your store i be like guess what.
I'm breaking into the registor gimme cash punk.
This is just a game but we ain't playing.
We 'bout our buisness &amp; buying ourselves dang planes.
Copped a cargo bomb my homie did the same thang.
So if you in the air you'll get shot quick like bang bang.
In theÂ  strip Club like bow chicka wow wow.
In the country hitting cow ca-ca cow cows.
Is that a bike i want it now na-na now now.
Got a problem then it's pow pa-pa pow pow.
Are you stupid or dumb bro.
I just hijacked a lambo.
If you gotta problem i got some ammo.
Bam ho.

Stupid kids and their Grand Theft Auto.
Whatever.
Alright, time to go kill some people.
Fades until video is over.
