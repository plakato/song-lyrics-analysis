Ridin Down The Block Lyrics
by Yung Nate.

Riding down the block like what else should a brother do.
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might … you.
Rolling down my window G I have an air conditioner.
What I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to.
Riding down the block like what else should a brother do.
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might … you.
Rolling down my window G I have an air conditioner.
What I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to.

Homie, I'm fine, I'm goodie good.
Packet full of dreams, I'm still in the hood.
Shawty you fine, fine, I'm feeling the love.
Smoke in here, rose in the cups.
Oh, news that will make daily word to my mom.
So never have to hold my tongue … worst than the.
Money over everything the words of my all.
Come to big slice speakers, they be bumping in cars.
Caught a bit for my dog, it's got away from the charge.
No more maggots, fuck the … babies now it's just …
Don't confuse my confidence with arrogance, dawg.
Middle finger to the law, got my stereo won.
I heard they killed Vince but I'ma carry them on.
Dog eat, dog word but I'ma share him a bone.
My … on my sleep and I'm wearing it home.
But I hope the beat not here in the zone.

Riding down the block like what else should a brother do.
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might … you.
Rolling down my window G I have an air conditioner.
What I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to.
Riding down the block like what else should a brother do.
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might … you.
Rolling down my window G I have an air conditioner.
What I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to.

Homie, I'm fine, I'm goodie good.
Packet full of dreams, I'm still in the hood.
Shawty you fine, fine, I'm feeling the love.
Smoke in here, rose in the cups.
It ain't the play you ...unless you play in the truck.
Get some myself and nothing ain't making enough.
Shawty make that ass … you ain't shaking it enough.
Yeah you got a nigger rock but you ain't making it come.
Tell a role whether when I like it favorite duck.
It's in the hood no fire I was blazing it up.
Already put work now I'm double enough.
They ain't fucking with us, they just fucking it up.
I'm with a couple of bros, they accompany us.
For a couple of hours, but don't get confi with us.
I just came for your guts, I ain't keeping in love.
And if it ain't trust funds, I ain't keeping the trust.

Riding down the block like what else should a brother do.
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might … you.
Rolling down my window G I have an air conditioner.
What I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to.
Riding down the block like what else should a brother do.
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might … you.
Rolling down my window G I have an air conditioner.
What I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to.
Riding down the block, then let me see you put your hands up, up, up, up, up.
Riding down the block, then let me see you put your hands up, up, up, up, up.
Riding down the block, then let me see you put your hands up, up, up, up, up.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, then let me see you put your hands up, up, up, up,.
up, up, up, up, up.
