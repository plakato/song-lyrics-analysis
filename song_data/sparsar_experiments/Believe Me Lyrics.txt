Packing that haze,

Think I'm playing 
Nobody in the game should step in 
My lane. When I drop 16s

Running through rookies

Only, good behind screens 
Why. I go so hard soon enough I'll answer. All of your how comes/ 
Yeah, partly for the income 
More so for the outcome, think Martin think malcolm 
I'm trynna help? U out son 
So, even when we tired, exhausted feeling outdone 
I know for sure
