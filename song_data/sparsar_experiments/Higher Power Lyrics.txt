Higher Power Lyrics
by Boston.

Hey, my higher power.
Yeah, give me the power.
.
Let me love you.
Take me home to your religion for the night.
Let me touch you.
Teach me how to see your vision through my eyes.
Turn the pages.
Tell my story, let me face another day.
Safe embraces, I feel it comin' now.
My captain's on his way.
.
Hey, my higher power.
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.
Yeah, give me the power.
It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
.
Yeah!!.
.
Let me hold you.
Take me back into the secrets of my mind.
Let me know you.
Come and save me Lord.
Don't let me cross the line.
.
Hey, my higher power.
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.
Yeah, give me the power.
It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
.
God, grant me the courage to accept the things.
I cannot change.
And the power to change the things I can.
And the wisdom to know the difference.
.
Hey, my higher power.
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.
Yeah, give me the power It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
.
Ooh, let me love you.
Ooh, let me love you.
.
Hey, my Higher Power.
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.
.
Yeah, my Higher Power.
It's the beginning of another day.
.
Hey, my Higher Power.
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.
.
Yeah, my Higher Power.
It's the beginnin', the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
.
Hey, my higher power.
Yeah, my higher power.
Hey, my higher power.
