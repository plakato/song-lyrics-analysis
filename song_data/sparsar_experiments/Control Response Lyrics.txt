Control Response Lyrics
by Bizarre.

Yeah, Bizarre.
Weird out.
Bout to give these niggas some bars right quick.
In the studio live.
Yeah.
Let me get ready man.
Turn my headphones up man.
Bout to get busy on these niggas man.
Yeah.
Let these niggas know what time it is.
Yeah.
I'm ready.
Hold on, Hold on.
Hold on.
Yo yo.
Yo.
Alright here I go.
Y'all niggas ready?
Check it out.
Man turn this shit off.
Hahahaha.

Shoutout to Kendrick Lamar and the Black Hippies.
This is my diss.
Ayo Doug.. Got anymore Xanax left?
My muhfucking back is killing me.
