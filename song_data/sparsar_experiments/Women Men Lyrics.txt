Women Men Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


Women men.
Women, women, women, women men.
Women men.
Women, women, women, women men.
I'm gon' lose my mind Dear Lord.
Cause Mama Dorothy can't cry no more.
Have mercy on my soul.
For not having mercy on my foes.

If success is a 10 foot wall, they give you a 5 foot ladder.
Niggas wishing death on me, hoping I lose my bladder.
Or my pockets on malnutrition but they keep getting fatter.
That's why they mad at me but actually, I never been no rapper.
The fuck is a royalty check? J gave a couple advances.
But to pay bills I was taking penitentiary chances.
He wanted to borrow money but I ain't give it to him.
So now he like, when we see Z-Ro, let's run up on him and give it to him, shit.
I wish a motherfucker would.
Kidnap you, kill you, drop you off in the motherfucking woods.
You talentless, I can't help that I'm this motherfucking good.
You regular weed to a kush smoker, not that motherfucking good.
Fuck feeding these niggas fish, I'd rather show' em how to catch they own.
And that's when they get mad, where they at now? I guess they gone.
Hate that I'm here for a real reason.
But no offence to no broke bitch, I'm on my seventeenth season.

Women men.
Women, women, women, women men.
Women men.
Women, women, women, women men.
I'm gon' lose my mind Dear Lord.
Cause Mama Dorothy can't cry no more.
Have mercy on my soul.
For not having mercy on my foes.

First off, fuck the world, when the shit gon' change?
Soutside where we ride, Hoover Crippin mane.
Fucking right I'm a player but never touched your wife.
Really tryna do you a favour, don't fuck up your life.
Got niggas watching me like they undercovers and spies.
And I can tell which ones cause they can't look me in my eyes.
Wonder why you ain't heard from them and they can't be found.
I betcha you can find 'em if you look in the ground.
Bitch I know you, you rap about the shit you ain't go through.
Always telling people you did shit you saw Ro do.
I'm a gangster, capital murder, that's what I am.
You's a state jail felony, less than a gram.

Women men.
Women, women, women, women men.
Women men.
Women, women, women, women men.
I'm gon' lose my mind Dear Lord.
Cause Mama Dorothy can't cry no more.
Have mercy on my soul.
For not having mercy on my foes.

My brotha you on Facebook all the time liking brother fights.
You a modern day slave, no fucks given about your brother's life.
You'd rather see us kill each other, won't even stand up for your brother.
rights.
Ole Ku Klux Klan ass with a tan ass nigga.
Always beggin everybody for money when you ain't got none.
Be actin like you don't know nobody when you got some.
I don't owe you nothing cuz you just came home.
Like yo name be on the same check that my name on.
Matter fact, I ain't get shit from y'all when I came home.
They be like Ro, I ain't no rapper tho, my change ain't long.
I could save these niggas lives but they still would complain.
Appreciate ya, but what took so motherfuckin long mane?
Then they wonder why my attitude is Fuck 'em all.
If I'm real and y'all fake, that mean it ain't nothing we can discuss at all.
I didn't hear about it I was right there when that man got down.
Shouldn't have been havin' so many conversations downtown.

Women men.
Women, women, women, women men.
Women men.
Women, women, women, women men.
I'm gon' lose my mind Dear Lord.
Cause Mama Dorothy can't cry no more.
Have mercy on my soul.
For not having mercy on my foes.
