New York
by Ryan Adams.

Well, I shuffled through the city on the 4th of July.
I had a firecracker waiting to blow.
Breakin' like a robber who makin' its way.
To the cities of Mexico.
Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A.
I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th.
Had myself a lover who was finer than gold.
But I've broken up and busted up since.

And love don't play any games with me.
Anymore like she did before.
The world won't wait, so I better shake.
That thing right out there through the door.
Hell, I still love you, New York.

Found myself a picture that would fit in the folds.
Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good.
Still amazed I didn't lose it on the roof of the place.
When I was drunk and I was thinking of you.
Every day the children they were singing their tune.
Out on the streets and you could hear from inside.
Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd.
I would wait for you and I'd try to hide.

And love won't play any games with me.
Anymore if you don't want it to.
The world won't wait and I watched you shake.
But honey, I don't blame you.
Hell, I still love you, New York.
Hell, I still love you, New York.
New York.

I remember Christmas in the blistering cold.
In a church on the upper west side.
Babe, I stood their singing, I was holding your arm.
You were holding my trust like a child.
Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue B.
But I tried to keep the overhead low.
Farewell to the city and the love of my life.
At least we left before we had to go.

And love won't play any games with you.
Anymore if you want 'em to.
So we better shake this old thing out the door.
I'll always be thinkin' of you.
I'll always love you though New York.
I'll always love you though New York, New York, New York.
