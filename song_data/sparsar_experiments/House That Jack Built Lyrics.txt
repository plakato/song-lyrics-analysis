House That Jack Built Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

I ain't never loved nobody, nobody ever gonna love me.
And I never understood why he's so good, I gotta kill a case of jealousy.
Why would any woman ever really wanna love another.
Just a drifter, gonna kiss her, first I gotta kill her mister.
I'm in the house that Jack built, up on the hill.
More than time for this man to kill.
Yeah there's a gun on the floor, an empty bottle of pills.
In the house that Jack built, waiting for Jill.
Come on baby I'm gonna light you a candle, pour you a glass of wine.
We both know ol' Jack wasn't much of the sweet romantic kind.
So come on over baby, maybe I'll make you the lady of the.
House that Jack built, up on the hill.
More than time for this man to kill.
Yeah there's a gun on the floor, an empty bottle of pills.
In the house that Jack built, waiting for Jill.
So come on over baby, maybe I'll make you the lady of the.
House that Jack built, up on the hill.
More than time for this man to kill.
Yeah there's a gun on the floor, an empty bottle of pills.
In the house that Jack built, waiting for Jill.
