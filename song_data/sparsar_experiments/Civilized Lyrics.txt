Civilized Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

Fear grows.
Just like a tree it grows.
The roots tear apart the soul.
Suck the nerves.
Suck the core.
You' re eyes.
I fear.
You' re words.
I fear.
Dehumanized.
Destructiv.
Poisonous.

I hear the rhythm.
The rhythm ofrage, death and panic.
Millions of hearts.
Bit the rhythm.
It is nervous.
Unsteady.

Bloodthirst.
Here come the wheels of the hate machine.
Man distroyes what man built.
Monuments are falling down.
Cruel gods.
Greedy gods.
False gods.
Here comes a man.
Civilized.

Nature's scream.
Mothers' moan.
Old man's tears.
A child is weeping.
It's we who are our worst, deadly enemies.
We had the holocaust.
The Vietnam.
We had the world wars.
We killed in the name of God.
We burnt the land.
We burried alive.
We made men slaves.
We killed their pride.
We are a rascist's song.
The black rain.
The starve of the starving.
The tortured man's pain.
We are the lier's tongue.
The brothers war.
The broken hope.
We are civilized.
