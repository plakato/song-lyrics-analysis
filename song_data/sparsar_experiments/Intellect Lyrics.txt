Intellect Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


Please listen when it's me spittin'. You don't wanna be.
Missing these lyrics. 16 hitting 16s.
Sick Schemes from the kid teen.
And if it isn't glistening I'm just polishing, wiping it clean.
Aye yo, it's I.I partna. Smooth.
as.
Bachata. Mount-IiMZ drips this hot.
lava.
Since I was a gaga: Kaka in the pampa.
Born to be a monsta and hit them with the bonkers.
I'm kinda, no, I'm absolutely whooping.
Rappers who seem to be cruising for bruisings.
I'm parachuting. The iiiUth be loopy.
When beats be looping, I do be shooting. Shoot.
Who's eluding the crews grasp. We too vast to pass.
And whoever stands in the crews path.
Is getting blasted. Get em in a casket.
Rap contrasting from the average rappers.

Lyrics is Legitimate. Hit 'em with the literate.
Hit 'em where it's sensitive. Spit it for the spit of it.
Admit it. We be killin' it.

Do you believe in dreams?
Cause we surpassed all the chattering guys.
Cause to be completely honest I'd rather be high.
Chilling with a tenderoni with some flattering eyes.
And we fly. Yeah we fly.

Mr. Newport, but cigarettes are not my preference.
The Hip Hop veteran. Tell them stay higher than heaven.
Sent. Stomp mud-holes into a puddle.
Niggas know my rhymes stay tougher than 6 o' clock stubble.
Chasing green faces. Cheesing with clean braces.
That nigga ain't never gon' fall like leaves raking.
I leave 'em shaking. We are pork. And you.
Niggas turkey bacon.
Like we're in Georgia with these hits we're makin'.
Niggas will get to fakin', but it's all good.
Where the lighters at? I got a sack and some backwoods.
Why you lying nigga? Bett' not come into these tiger woods.
These trees is Meagan Good, and we.
getting faded like you.
Wish you could. Hit 'em the good. Lit it in the woods.
And the spliff was good. Spitta with a hood. Al is hostile.
I'm Mr. Newport. I kick when I spit like I hit the.
Shoe store. James Bond. Lay songs 'til my days gone.
OG like Nate Dogg. With my J's on I get my blaze on.
2 yellow xannies is my preference.
A couple drink, and ounce of weed, and a bitch to have sex with.
Yea.

I'm chill upon contact, Immortal when I combat.
We be stacked like, Steeler's D within a dime pack.
Behind that mainstream vale, legend prevailed.
The Big Ls we're handing out to pig tails.
And goatees, the road leads.
Right to the roti, no hoes be.
In our quadrant, so stay in your margin or you'll owe me.
We in it through the rough routes, you not with it then get the fuck out.
It's 3rdiiiUth, strong willed niggas, this our rough house.
No buffouts needed, fall outs? I don't see it.
In this wasteland, you're just waste man, not needed.
Trap rapping is wack, get your mic jacked, now beat it.
Beasts of the east, yeah, we breathe it.
Legion of leaders is heated.
Best believe it, if I said it, then it'll get done.
We bit none, son, creativity is just into me.
Got the illest build, Matilda skills, no getting rid of me.
Word is bond, the surge is long lasting, we taking action.
Now girls leaving their has-beens for me, they think I'm dashing.
I'm not for getting trapped though, I tap the ho, then I'm dashing.
Relieves me from my thrashing, like Gyarados on aspirin.
I bare my toes, the lair I go, reload for my next action.
