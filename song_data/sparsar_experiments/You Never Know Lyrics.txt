You Never Know Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.


He been texting you all day.
I mean what more could he say.
If it keeps up this way.
I'm A Have some things to say to him.
If we see him don't wave to him.
If he silly don't play with him.
If he say it don't stay with him.
And don't you dare go lay with him.
Because I see the thoughts conjuring.
New guy bothering.
Yall must talk bout everything that's the position I was in.
Say he want to come around well go head and try it then.
Say it's all a lie then tell me why you is nodding then.

You could be playing games but you never know.
Lying to your face but you never never know.
You never know X6.
You may think it's a man but you never know.
It could be her best friend but you never Know.
You never know X6.

Your not being your.
Your Not being yourself and it's scaring me.
Put down the Phone.
Put down the phone continue to look up and stare at me.
With the gilt in your eyes.
They lower in size.
I know very well your comparing me.
There's some other guy.
Who's better than I.
You said that your self don't you glare at me.
I tried to give you everything all the things that come to mind.
That's him i know the number and all you say is never mind.
Don't walk away Because i know the lie.
You was caught in the act girl don't you cry.
I'm the one who's hurt don't swirl your eyes.
Your the one in the wrong but i never realized.
