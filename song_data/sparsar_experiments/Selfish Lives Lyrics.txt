Selfish Lives Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.


Silence once that you speak.
Reform the rights till they're tired and weak.

Strangers passing by.
Turn our vision under the eye in the sky.
Who do you trust that's on the currency, man?
Why's it so hard, don't you understand?

Selfish lies.
Cover the things that forbid your smile.
Will we ever find our way?

Do you wanna be a slave to the system?
For men are jagged, the only position.
Pick em' off as easy as one, two , three.
?

Selfish lies.
Cover the things that forbid your smile.
Will we ever find our way?
Selfish types.
Are born outside of the satellites.
Are we better off today?

Come to life.
Reach inside yourself.
Now.

Selfish lies.
Cover the things that forbid your smile.
Will we ever find our way?
Selfish types.
Are born outside of the satellites.

Selfish lies.
Selfish types.
