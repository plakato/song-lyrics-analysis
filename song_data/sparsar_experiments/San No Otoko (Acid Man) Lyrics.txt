San No Otoko (Acid Man) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


LSD on me.
You know I got the acid and its all on me.
I be in the party and these girls on me.
Because they know I got it on me and its all on me.
Boy, that LSD got these girls on me.
And they see me smoking weed so they all on me.
And they want that LSD so they all on me.
I'm the acid man shawty and I still got weed.
If you need it holla at me if you wanna get it good.
Man, I got the hottest sack riding 'round the hood.
Everybody call me all day for the goods.
Girls all on me for that LSD plug.
I be like, damn baby girl showing love.
Twerkin' in the club as soon as I walk up.
I never get told, no, they just bendin' over and they go.
They twerk it so good, I be like whoa whoa.
Shes so damn thick, I can't even see shit.
Around that fuckin' booty, so I'm just staring at it.
Everytime I hit the club, I'm smoking weed.
In the fuckin' back, with my mo'fucking team.
I got 9 real niggas that'll beat your ass quick.
And a hundred thousand more if it gets hella serious.
Everytime I swing around the corner I'm high as fuck.
I don't give a fuck, when I see the cops I don't duck.
A nigga play on me, and you know I'm getting up.
I beat his ass quick, then I'm back on the blunts.
Bitch.

Hundred tabs on my tongue.
All my bitches grown, but I'm young, and I'm dumb.
Switchblade on, please don't step up to me wrong.
You don't want a problem, Bones came with the thugs.
Drugs in my blood, backwoods in my lungs.
Ash on my shirt, dead bitches on my rug.
Young Jerry Springer, pimpin' all the baddest bitches.
Don't you pass me a swisher if you don't wanna issue.
Guttin' all your pre-rolls, dump 'em in my wood.
Steppin' on the scene, razor blade on my nuts.
Creepin' in the cut, now I'm trippin' in the club.
Fuck your boyfriend, don't you tell me you're in love.
I know what you want, you can best believe I got it.
High as fuck , and a sock full of profit.
Bones, sesh.
