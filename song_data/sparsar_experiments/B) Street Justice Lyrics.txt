B) Street Justice Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Twisted Sister.
Stay Hungry.
B) Street Justice.
IT HAPPENED.
IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT.
SO UNEXPECTED CAME THE KNIFE.
A CHILD'S SCREAM.
SLICED THROUGH THE AIR.
BUT NO ONE CAME.
OR SEEMED TO CARE.
NO!
THE MAN'S DESCRIPTION.
DID LITTLE GOOD.
A LOCAL STRANGER.
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THOSE LITTLE KIDS.
OHH, HE LEFT BEHIND.
WITH THEIR MANGLED LIVES.
AND THEIR TORTURED MINDS.
SINCE HE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE.
THEN DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR?
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
LET NO MERCY SHOW.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
DON'T LET HIM GO.
THE MAN WAS CAUGHT.
AND BROUGHT BEFORE A JUDGE.
WHO HAD JUST RETURNED.
FROM A THREE DRINK LUNCH.
HIS LAWYER SCREAMED YOU MUST SET HIM FREE.
AND OFF HE WENT.
ON A TECHNICALITY.
SINCE THE LAW DON'T SEEM TO CARE.
THEN DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR?
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
WHY SHOULD PARENTS CRY?
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
HOW MANY HAVE TO DIE?
THE MOB ASSEMBLED.
SMOKE FILLED THE AIR.
AND MARCHED IN ANGER.
TO DO WHAT'S FAIR.
TO BRING TO JUSTICE.
THIS SOULESS THING.
AND SHOW THE OTHERS.
WHAT EVIL BRINGS.
NOW BEFORE YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD.
THINK IF IT WAS YOUR CHILD INSTEAD.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
TELL ME WHAT YOU'D DO.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
PRAY THIS ISN'T TRUE.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
WHY SHOULD PARENTS CRY.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
HOW MANY HAVE TO DIE.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
WHEN SLIME ESCAPES THE LAW.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
WE'LL EVEN UP THE SCORE.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
LET NO MERCY SHOW.
CALL FOR STREET JUSTICE.
GET HIM, GET HIM, GET HIM....
