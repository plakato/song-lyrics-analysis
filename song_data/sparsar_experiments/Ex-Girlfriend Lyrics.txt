Ex-Girlfriend Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


I guess it's my fault.
That I got caught up.
Knowing damn well that you and her just broke up.

You say it's about me and not the last.
She's the past.
Did I ask you about who she was?
No, I didn't.
Soooo.

What would make you I wanna know about all.
Ya'll did and felt before?
Tell me what the hell you even got with me for?
Tell me what the hell you even got with me for?

No matter how you front it'll always show.
That you ain't never ever let her go.
Tell me what the hell you even got with me for?
Yo, I'm out the door.
Don't tell me.
Don't go cause.

How can we work it out.
When all I hear about your ex girlfriend, huh?

Cause if we so in love.
Why am I jealous of your ex girlfriend, huh?

Always talking 'bout.
What I don't do or.
What she would do.

Baby, would you.
Could you stop, dissing me.
Comparing me to her just pisses me off.
Cause if shes what you need.
Then why you steady hanging round with me?

Boy, you better off letting me leave.
Cause I'm a walk the fuck on out.
If I gotta hear one more thing about her.
Oooooo oooooo.

Now lemme tell you something.
See, you kinda always talking of your ex girlfriend.

I kinda always think you still love you ex girlfriend.

See, you always talkin of your ex girlfriend.

I kinda always think you still love your ex girlfriend.

Boy, don't tell me girl, you can't go.
Save your breath cause baby I know.
You don't feel how did before.
You ain't ready to let her go.

I can't waste no more time with you.
Knowing that I'll be number two.
You don't feel how did before.
You ain't ready to let her go.
Soooooo whoooaaaa.

How can we work it out.
When all I hear about's your ex girlfriend huh?

Cause if we so in love.
Why am I jealous of your ex girlfriend huh?

See, you kinda always talkin of your ex girlfriend.

I kinda always think you still love your ex girlfriend.
