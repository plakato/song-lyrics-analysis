Real Love Is Rare Lyrics
by Yung mazi.


Your heart fragile be careful cuz real love is rare.
They show me love outta fear.
My rep can get me da chair.
I never shoot in da air.
Cuz thats like bussin at god.
Repent for all of my sins on my knees i need god.

Hold up, po up, I've been loosin all my life.
So alot knows i know better.
Broke as fuck,hurt did it wrong i feel better.
My girl felt in love wit da cheddar.
I felt in love with berettas.
I came up bossed up now im pull da trigga like a coogi sweater.
Michael jackson jackin 36 zips, dats a brick.
Fans i dont do follower so stop takin pics.
What street dirty gotta a fm wit da extra 30.
Yoppa pull dis crib ?
100it gang lip zipped.
Murda gang in foreign whips dont get flip.
Rap da 5, iphone5, my trap phone still flipping.
They claimin love u but they strip u.
Im in love wit money not a stripper.
This robitussin sippers yall ain't leaning' nigga. stop lying.

Your heart fragile be careful cuz real love is rare.
They show me love outta fear.
My rap can get me da chair.
I never shoot in da air.
Cuz thats like bussin at god.
Repent for all of my sins on my knees i need god.

Imma change my life on everything i learn.
Mucho you my everything, can't take it. geeked up rick james im on everything.
Nobody hold me down,or da pistol im on everything.
I been too hell i accept the pain with maryjane.
I ain't see shit i ain't heard shit,i ain't gon say shit, ion know no name.
Its only rite to remain silence.
If u snitch result to violence.
I finally ran up da sack.
Niggas shot me 6 times.
In da head in da back.
Cuz if u live by u gon die by.
Ran off wit bout 500 racks.
Took 3 years in rehab nigga my ? and my dawg sendin on drugs.
