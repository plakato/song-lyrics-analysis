Cheers! Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


It's my time.
Cheers! Toast to crime.
It's my time.
Cheers! Toast to crime.

We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!

Hey!

I'm hard, dick. You a pussy-hole.
I might lean back, but you do the Tootsie Roll.
And the Butterfly, but the slug'll fly.
And put an end to all that. No time to wonder why.
I feed my bitch mad bread... thunder thighs.
Your ho' lookin' hon'gry... humble pie.
My girl's 5'4 - a size 4.
Mine's eye-candy. Yours - an eyesore.
How're you faithful to that known slut-bucket, yo?

I got an AIDS-ridden dime-piece from Tuckahoe.
That'll leave you wing niggas burnin'... buffalo.
Jadakiss Raping you! Raping you... Jadakiss.
You hard? Grab your gat. Aim for Mister Zeta - miss....
Now, it's my turn. Bullets in your sideburns.
Bring the heat to your girl's nigger-naps... nice perm.

I tried to tell that b*tch, it's my time.
Cheers! Toast to crime.
I tried to tell you niggas, it's my time.
Cheers! Toast to crime.

We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!

Hey!

Now, I know I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back with a bigger dick.
Looking for a clitoris to smack with this ligament.
Chicks don't even call it dick.
They call it The Smash-Pipe. It takes an alcoholic trick to swallow all of.
it.
Like Monica, my psychotic, Gothic bitch with bionic tits.
On my solid, brollic dick, downing my demonic tonic, kid.
She gotta be drunk at the time to have a ball with it.
I'll dunk my junk in her trunk 'til I'm f*cking a ball o' sh*t!
The b*tch is bad, looking like Diane Kruger.
She had an Asian friend, perfect for my man, Junior.
Too bad she only knew Mandarin.
I'm looking at Grav' like, Damn, you should've been watching 'Nihao Kailan'.
sooner!
He told me, As long as her mouth opens....
That's all I'm hopin' for, is a new throat to be chokin'..
So, we got it on and poppin', knockin' moccasins off of these hot chicks.
Until the time came for them to wop again.

That's when I told them bitches:.

It's my time.
Cheers! Toast to crime.
I tried to tell you niggas, it's my time.
Cheers! Toast to crime.

We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!
We in the how-how-house!

Hey!
