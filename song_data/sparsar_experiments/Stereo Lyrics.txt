Stereo Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.


What'S happenin' y'all, 
This particular song. This is I'm dedicating this for my to my stereo 
She's always been there for me, 
 
We're, too material minded too materialistic 
But one possession I prize is just my stereo 
I got her when I was five after I wished it. 
Now all I need to survive's a simple stereo, 
 
She's with me. When I'm feeling low 
And. No one else knows 
I take her everywhere. I go 
Uh uh, oh 
 
The only girl in my life when other chicks, dis' 
Nobody there to confide in, but my stereo 
She sang Marley. We vibe Natural Mystic 
Until the day that I die. Gon' love my stereo 
 
She's with me. When I have no dough 
Totally broke 
I take her everywhere. I go 
Uh uh, oh 
 
Well. My mother met her at a mall 
I, believe she had emigrated from Japan, c'mon 
On display, but they ain't. Never let her music play 
Because. Her boss was a mean old man 
And. He didn't like kid's dancing and rapping all around her bumpin' that hip-
hop 
But everybody love her in the ghetto and they start to groove 
Whenever. She be on the block to rock 
C'mon 
 
We're too material minded too materialistic 
But one possession I prize is just my stereo 
I got her when I was five after I wished it 
Now all. I need to survive's a simple stereo, 
 
She's with me. When I'm feeling low 
And, no one else knows 
I take her everywhere. I go 
Uh uh oh
