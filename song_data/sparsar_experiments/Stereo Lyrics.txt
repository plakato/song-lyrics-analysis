Stereo Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.


What's happenin' y'all.
This particular song, this is, I'm dedicating this for my, to my stereo.
She's always been there for me.

We're too material minded, too materialistic.
But one possession I prize is just my stereo.
I got her when I was five, after I wished it.
Now all I need to survive's a simple stereo.

She's with me when I'm feeling low.
And no one else knows.
I take her everywhere I go.
Uh uh oh.

The only girl in my life when other chicks dis'.
Nobody there to confide in but my stereo.
She sang Marley we vibe Natural Mystic.
Until the day that I die gon' love my stereo.

She's with me when I have no dough.
Totally broke.
I take her everywhere I go.
Uh uh oh.

Well my mother met her at a mall.
I believe she had emigrated from Japan, c'mon.
On display but they ain't never let her music play.
Because her boss was a mean old man.
And he didn't like kid's dancing and rapping all around her bumpin' that hip-.
hop.
But everybody love her in the ghetto and they start to groove.
Whenever she be on the block to rock!
C'mon.

We're too material minded, too materialistic.
But one possession I prize is just my stereo.
I got her when I was five, after I wished it.
Now all I need to survive's a simple stereo.

She's with me when I'm feeling low.
And no one else knows.
I take her everywhere I go.
Uh uh oh.
