Love Will Tear Us Apart Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

When routine bites hard.
And ambition go low.
And resentments ride high.
But emotions won't go.
And we're changing our ways.
Taking different roads.

But love.
Love will tear us apart.
Again.

Love.
Love will tear us apart.
Again.

Why is the bedroom so cold?
You turned away on your side.
Is my timing that flawed.
Or respect run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal.
That we kept through our lives.

But love.
Love will tear us apart.
Again.

Love.
Love will tear us apart.
Again.

You cry out in your sleep.
All my failings exposed.
There's a taste in my mouth.
As desperation takes hold.
It's something so good.
Just can't function no more.

But love.
Love will tear us apart.
Again.

Love.
Love will tear us apart.
Again.
