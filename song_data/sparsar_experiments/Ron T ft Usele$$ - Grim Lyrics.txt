Ron T ft Usele$$ - Grim Lyrics
by Rusty.

Usele$$.

She's tellin me, parking lot garage.
I dumped a fire horse, and she came.
In my mouth.
I wear designer jeans, Fendi Gucci jeans.
Mayweathers on my team.
Justin Bieber can't sing.
Now I'm in a Cadillac, smoking with Jack Black.
Don't stop, I got a few more bars from the top.
I know what I wanna see, I'm depressed hiding.
Yo girlfriend told me she got...

Ron T.

Grim Reaper.
Ah, Grim Reaper.
Grim Reaper x3.
Dry your tears.
Grim Reaper x3.
Baby, Grim Reaper.

Ron T.

Yeah, we was hoppin' in the chimes.
Going to the cookies, well I got the protein.
Tell McGirl, what's your middle name?
I don't want Stacy, I want Bethany &amp; Katy.
We went to High School, old bar in Texas.
And Bangleton, is where we stayed.
We never fucked around, all we got is laid.
We always got paid, well checked &amp; respected.
Me &amp; My girl look like Mr. Kennah did.
Besecet, Recipe on my cheese.
Your cheese looks like beans, eatin'.
Jelly cookies, and I'm eatin' jolly ranchers.
You a rancher, you at the ranch, you serve.
Cowboy haystacks, your horse is nothin'.
But some cardstacks. Damn, that's some.
Real hammer shit yo, your ladder?
Is like a painting of my dick yo.
I'm like yeah, you look like a Wendy's.
Man, but you work at Whataburger yo..

Ron T.

Grim Reaper x4.
Now I'm flippin' stacks, you can't.
Tell me who I really am at that.
Yeah.
Grim Reaper x7.
No baby, no, the Grim Reaper's.
Coming, fly and fly, Ima fly.
Into Kirby land, pikachu lend us.
A hand.
