Here to Stay Lyrics
by Zomboy.

Yeah.
Zomboy.
Alongside your girl.
Lady Chann.

-chuh.
Come on-.
I said, voila!
-chuh.
Yo yo yo yo yo yo!
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo!
Yeh!
Me 'n my soldiers are here to stay!
We're here to stay.
You can't move my army no no noway way way.
Noway noway!
Ready for the laws, on the test line hey.
Raised in the bayou, oh, oh, now pay!
I am muscle and I am here to stay-ay-ay.
-!come on!
