GAMER Lyrics
by Xpertthief.


G-A-M-E-R.
Spell it out bitch, that's who we are.
Locked and loaded my controller out the holster yes you know it's time to go.
to war.
Sniper rifle ready one shot and your head is confetti.
Semi auto burst it's the worst when your whole team ain't even ready get ready.

Now drop back in your zone, charging my moves like cellular phones.

Well guess what you about to get owned.
Play all day every day sorry if you call me you get voice mail baby.
Only two away from getting dogs and my dawgs in the game with AK's going crazy.
That's how we do it though, chopper gunner man ima need two of those.
Semtex get wrecked get stuck reflex like a freak control hit the peak.
Snipe game so lethal pro so grizz like a bear send chills through your bones.
get killed.
My game is on top see my name at the top.
You gonna need to get a shield when you see me.
When you on the battlefield better fear me.
The steel from my gun right on your heel be.
Stacking them banana clips no peel please.
Throw your body in the marsh like Randy.
Your team gonna get crushed like candy.
Shotgun on your cheeks like sandy.
Things looking real grim Billy and Mandy.

G-A-M-E-R spell it out bitch that's who we are.
Locked and loaded my controller out the holster yes you know it's time to go.
to war.
Sniper rifle ready one shot and your head is confetti.
Semi auto burst it's the worst when your whole team ain't even ready get ready.
