Adrenaline Lyrics
by RuPaul.


And to the ones I love.
Know that you're the reason why.
I dare to live my life.
I dare to liberate my mind.
You're running through my veins.
Make me come alive.

RuPaul &amp; Myah Marie.
I think about the world.
Like a dream within a dream.
Anything you want.
Things are never what they seem.
But the rush is worth the ride.
Make me come alive.

RuPaul &amp; Myah Marie.
Gimme one shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline.
One shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline!
Gimme one shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline.
One shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline....

&amp; Myah Marie.

Can I get it to go?

Can I get, can I get it to go?
Can I get, can I get it to go?  x4.

RuPaul &amp; Myah Marie.
And to the ones I love.
Know that you're the reason why.
I dare to live my life.
I dare to liberate my mind.
You're running through my veins.
Make me come alive.

Think about, think about the world you're in.
Like a dream, like a dream you're living in.
Anything, anything you want you find.
But it's never gonna be what's on your mind.
But the rush, but the rush is worth the ride.
Make me come alive.

RuPaul &amp; Myah Marie.
Gimme one shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline.
One shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline!
Gimme one shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline.
One shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline....

&amp; Myah Marie.

Can I get it to go?

Can I get, can I get it to go?
Can I get, can I get it to go?  x4.

Breakdown.

RuPaul &amp; Myah Marie.
Gimme one shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline.
One shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline!
Gimme one shot, one shot.
Of adrenaline, adrenaline.
Adrenaline, adrenaline.
Adrenaline, adrenaline-drenaline-drenaline-drenaline.

&amp; Myah Marie.

Can I get it to go?

Can I get, can I get it to go?
Can I get, can I get it to go?  x4.
