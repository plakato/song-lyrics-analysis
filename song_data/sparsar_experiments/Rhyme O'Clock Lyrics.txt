Rhyme O'Clock Lyrics
by Wordburglar.

More Or Les and Wordburglar.
It's More Or Les and Wordburg up in the spot.
With the speakers turned on and the mics are hot.
We got people in the place who came to rock.
Yo Burg!
What's the time on your watch?
Rhyme o'clock.
We all up in the spot.
With the speakers turned on and the mics are hot.
We got people in the place who came to rock.

What's the time on your watch?

Rhyme o'clock.
We meld minds like Spock.
Bubbling like Corona when a lime is dropped.
In the wild making noise like when pines get chopped.
Moving heads like ladies who's behinds are hot.
Designed to rock.
Co-sign with props.
In an affidavit state and we define the spots.
So, why not?
Bring on the next hype bringer.
We take him out the ring like your ex-wife's finger.

More Or Les.
Pick your pain in the ass I'm having bed bugs.
I'm itching to get in the track, so can't forget some.
Lukewarm radio.
Pet that's taking your.
Cat for a thinking.
As I fly the the steps in.
Shallow.
Proceed with showtime at the Gallow.
To Gallow.
We roast like pig on park battle.
Metallo.
Can't keep your comics 'round me.
True reader for real.
Ask Wordburgy.

More Or Les and Wordburglar.

More Or Les.
Rhyme o'clock.
Greenwich mean top-noch digital.
When you kids talk sweet, slop songs pitiful.
Gag me with spoon.
Barf not minimal.
Plaque, it sticks to all your syllables.
Staying simple for the safest, civilian Syllabubs.
For the simian serious.
Motherfuck.
That I rhyme.
Keep it pumping like a big bilge in this building.
With the Burg in the business, you bridesmaids aren't brides.
We're lyric to the flow.

Wordburglar.
Halifax to Orlando.
Run the Millennium like Han or Lando.

Yeah, you know it's fam.
And I'm down with Sharon/sharing like Lois and Bram.
God damn!
Spread new dope rhymes.
All over the streets like ED-209.

And eat all the food in your grand fridge.

Rhyme o'clock.
Are you hurting? stressed?
Cause Burg and Les.
Will make you burden-less.

More Or Les.
For sure with Fresh Kils.
It's likely not broken.
Beat Hammer Time.
Like the son of Odin.

Wordburglar.
The super-villains.
Forget Loki and Red Skull.
We'll leave you more blue.
Than a depressed Brett Hull.

More Or Les.

Tia Eagle.
See no evil.
Peanuts.
Like bald people feeding beagles.

Wordburglar.
Yo we needn't needles.
To get DJ's to scratch this.

More Or Les.
Never sell out.

Wordburglar.
But we always on the backlist.

More Or Les.
Gotta re-up.

Wordburglar.
Before we get torrented.

More Or Les.
Haters gonna hate.

Wordburglar.
But it's really unwarranted.

More Or Les.
Yo, you want some more of this.

Wordburglar and More Or Les.
Good.
We knew there was a reason we came up to your hood.

More Or Les.
To rock it non-stop.

Wordburglar.
Keep it hot on stage.

Wordburglar and More Or Les.
And we doing big time.
Like the clock on Flav.
