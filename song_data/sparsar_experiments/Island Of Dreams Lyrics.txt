Island Of Dreams Lyrics
by Xperience.

Here is my innocence.
Island of dreams.
Back to the simple roots.
Back to extremes.
Live, live your life.
You, you have to leave or to survive.
If you feel weak - don't give up.
Don't, don't give up.
Here is my innocence.
Island of dreams.
Back to the simple roots.
Back to extremes, island of dreams.
Don't get me wrong.
We are growing up and getting strong.
If you feel weak - don't give up.
Don't, don't give up.
Here is my innocence.
Island of dreams.
Back to the simple roots.
Back to extremes, island of dreams.
