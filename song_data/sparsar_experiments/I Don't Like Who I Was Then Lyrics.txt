I Don't Like Who I Was Then Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

Tossed around like sea glass.
And you rounded out my edges.
I'll feel better when the headaches go away.
I've got a scar across my forehead.
Turning purple in the cold.
From a night at Shore Memorial.
I was sixteen and afraid.
Turned away.
And I'm working babyface.
Out of Mid-South in the eighties.
I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape.

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust.
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks.
I want to run till my lungs give up.
If I could manage not to fuck this up.
If I could manage not to fuck this up.
I think enough is enough.

Hidden in the tall grass.
In the naked light of day.
Put my past self in the ground.
I've been dancing on the grave.
I'm not the person that I was then.
You're standing in the way.
I was bitter, I was careless.
I was nineteen and afraid.

But you deserve more from me.
I don't know why I would say those things.
But you deserve more than me.
And I'm trying every day.

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust.
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks.
I want to run till my lungs give up.
If I could manage not to fuck this up.
If I could manage not to fuck this up.
I think enough is enough.

You left me walking in circles.
You were a shot in the dark.
You were the baby teeth I buried.
You were the sounds of distant cars.

You left me walking in circles.
You were a shot in the dark.
You were the banner that says no one.
That I tattooed across my heart.

You left me walking in circles.
You were a shot in the dark.
You scattered like ashes across every song that I write.
You are the light pollution stars.

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust.
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks.
I want to run till my lungs give up.
If I could manage not to fuck this up.
If I could manage not to fuck this up.
Enough is enough.
