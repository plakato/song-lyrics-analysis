No Teleportation Lyrics
by Swordplay.


Faucets make medicine for madmen.
Deliver me dilemma with generous lessons.
Offer the message but the message is often.
Not complicit with the manner in which it's delivered.

Sipping on that lithium battery, flatter me after the fact with an epitaph or.

I'll be singing up in heaven in a hotel lounge.
