It Might Rain Lyrics
by Two-9.

Damien.
For some odd reason, the top seems like the spot but not.
At the same time, for the Average.
Joe thinks that with the excess of money and the presence of a bad bitch.
signifies they grind.
Shine, keep the jeweler on speed dial meanwhile I'm.
Always keeping heat.
Is that really the life?
South of France is cool, but not when you can't shop in peace, nigga damn is.
that really the price?
I really love Atlanta but I feel i gotta move.
It's the only way that operations will run smooth.
And ooh, how ima miss this shit, Ill visit i promise.
Just don't change up.
I'm thinking west coast, Cali don't rain much.
Plus I heard that's the spot to be if you're famous.
But with that said.
I take that back cuz I really like the rain.
It goes better with the ?, better with some brain.
I just wanna kick it fuck the flashing lights.

Key!
All this money pocket what the fuck am I gon' do with it?
Bitches everywhere and the fact is that I'm super rich.
Hit the club with super grips and throw em at a stupid bitch.
Walk on stage and I'm getting mauled by a group of bitches.
Take her home and I take her ?, I take her night, and start a pipe, then say.
goodbye.
Break is done, all is fun.
But, all I need is one.
Maybe have some kids, preferably a son, but now all I got is drugs, women and.
the rest of gun.
All the smiles fake.
And I made a wrong turn on the way to fate.
Stuffin' hundreds in my pocket, but I misplaced the faith.
Makin' it easy for me to die like every day.
I try to talk to God but I don't know just what to say.
Say my momma and my daddy are good even though don't nobody love me.
I know Sally would, Sally is just a single ?

Pusuit of happiness but now I'm on a daily hunt.
Pound goes to sorrow.
I'll see you all tomorrow.
