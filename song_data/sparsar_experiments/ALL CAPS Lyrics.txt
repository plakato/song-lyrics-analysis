ALL CAPS Lyrics
by Ry.

F beating them, I rather leave them comatose.
Then take another dose.
Walking on stars like Los Angeles.
Lyrical Michelangelos, showing my all like.
David.
Running ravid like I'm trying to crack the Da Vinci Code.
Pen filled with contraband, mind flooded.
with the deception.
You flat like the surface of a vaginal contraception.
I'm the making of a legend like Hinton directed me.
I'm the shit, this food for thought - what a disgusting recipe.
Armed with a repertoire more versatile than The Fantastic Four.
Step to me, get cut like nets at The Final Four.
My repetition equals this killer fantastic flow.
Like Warren Buffet feet on it, Aids patients bleed on it.
Your punchlines, throw them at me - bob &amp; weave on them.
I can do this from the head and ya'll wearing weave on them.
Call me when you wanna hang like Nathan Hale with sleeves on him.
If you trying to sleep on him bet your girl gonna sleep with him.
Take out sleep and you know Ry add creep with them.
And by the way, I'm bout my money like Crete.
Flow like smacking your head off of Satan's gate - SHEESH.
Admit it, I'm on of the best rappers out at least.
I'm the Juggernaut meets Atlas mixed with a beast.
And ya'll steal flows as if you pulled it underneath my feet.
Never defeat me, but when I spit feet start dancing.
Doubters quit asking and other Emcees pop a ton of aspirins.
Cause these fat raps luxurious like Rick Ross in an Aston.
Astonishing, demolishing, fuck your apologies.
I'll sacrifice my Queen like Stepan Levitsky.
Equipped with the talent of four ones like Dirk Nowitzki.
