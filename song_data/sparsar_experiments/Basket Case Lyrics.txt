Basket Case Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Do you have the time?
To listen to me whine?
About nothing and everything.
All at once?
I am one of those.
Melodramatic fools.
Neurotic to the bone.
No doubt about it.

Sometimes i give myself the creeps.
Sometimes my mind sneaks up on me.
It all keeps adding up.
I think im cracking up.
Am I just paranoid or am I jsut stoned?

I went to a shrink.
To analyze my dreams.
She says its lack of sex.
Thats bringing me down.
I went to a whore.
He said my life's a bore.
So quit my whining.
Cause its bringing her down.

Sometimes i give myself the creeps.
Sometimes my mind sneaks up on me.
It all keeps adding up.
I think im cracking up.
Am I just paranoid or am I jsut stoned?

Grasping to control.
So I better hold on.

Sometimes i give myself the creeps.
Sometimes my mind sneaks up on me.
It all keeps adding up.
I think im cracking up.
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?
