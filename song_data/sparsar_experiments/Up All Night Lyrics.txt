Up All Night Lyrics
by Volumes.

I tried a thousand times to make you feel it.
Like the days when we had first met.
But I feel I never moved you.
What the fuck how did we forget?

And in another life would it be different.
Would we do it all again?
And at that would you tell me that you loved me?
All alone why should I pretend?

Gagged and bound.
You told me you broke down.
And I believed everything.
My love for you was logic drowned.
Round and round.
I came all the way down.
To tell you that I'm really here.
And I don't wanna waste my time.

Without you without me.
And I'm not being honest.
I get it back to get me off.
She did me dirty once before.
But now that's over.
I had it all in my hands.
Until you ripped it out again.

Let it go there's nothing left.
Underneath the masquerade.

You got me up all night.
I wake up in another room.
You wake up, you're never next to me.
Oh no, no, no.
And I'm coming home tonight.
But this house wasn't built for two.
If I let you have the rest of me.
Would you tell me the truth?

I tried a thousand times to make you feel it.
Like the days when we had first met.
But I feel I never moved you.
What the fuck how did we forget?

And in another life would it be different.
Would we do it all again?
And at that would you tell me that you loved me?
All alone, why should I pretend?

I put my trust in you like I had nothing to lose.
Now I'm all confused.
Tell me what to do.
Tell me what to do.
Tell me what to do.

I had enough I'm through.
I put my trust in you.
I had nothing to lose.
Tell me what to do with that said.
I never wanna see you again.

It feels so flawless.
The summer in august when we fell in love.
Looking back remember when we first met.
The morning dove into my soul made of gold. No.
How could you be so thoughtless?
My lover my goddess I was so in love with.
How could you be so faithless?
Ignore dedication.
I showed her through.

Without you without me.
And I'm not being honest.
I get it back to get me off.
She did me dirty once before.
But now that's over.
I had it all in my hands.
Until you ripped it out again.

2x.
Let it go there's nothing left.
Underneath the masquerade, death.
