Everything's Love Lyrics
by Questionmark Asylum.


Ever, since back in the days things changed, 
We got a record deal now. Things rearrange 
Rearrange. How true 
Cause everything I wear is design. 
I sit back in my leather seats pop in my tape and recline. 
Baby is pumping in my system. 
Love we getting jiggy by the way my name is Digge 
The Mistafiss, be I 
I'm fly 
You, try 
Denied to me, but tonight I'll be the one who keeps on passing you by 
Step into my sec. Give me a second or two 
Give me, your number 
Here's. My number in case ya, wonder 
You know I'm living large check me out 
I'm chill 
I guess you didn't know that I'm that Bamma from the Ville 
 
No she didn't 
So. Let'S forget the kitten 
No time to stumble all over a line. That'S already been bitten. 
Man, forget it 
I! Guess she wasn't down with the Q 
So. Then we swing to another scene. To start the rendezvous. 
 
Everything is love. 
 
We stepped outside 
Chilling, with this groupie type, chick 
With lots of gold resembling my man Slick, Rick, 
Where you at Right. 
Where ya been Right: 
Where you at Right, 
Tell me how it is right: 
, 
I slap palms with Digge Doms 
Disarming. The alarm 
Mistafiss is in bliss within the cellular phone 
See I'ma swing by tell Ding I'll, maybe even bring my 
Black custom made double deuce slang. Cruiser 
Moola 
Who makes the moola 
Stoned in a trance like a glace from Medusa 
Through. The rear view paranoia got me, peaking 
Smoke like Uncle Ben, for no reason 
Never shall, I wonder, never shall I need 
Caught up in the game. While I'm trying to succeed. 
 video now the whole city know 
Everything's love 
Yo. It'S the poor in swole 
Dollars. I fold 
I'm in front of your building. Let'S be ready to roll 
Ayo, my man who's, ready to scoop me in the black Land' 
Is, you foul boy, 
But, no 
See, everything's, love 
But, not so fast, cuz 
Not. Until I get myself to finish the job, 
Then peace to the 8 Square Mob and yo, we outtie 
Rosta bust. A U and head straight for the fucking party, 
 
Everything's love 
 
Now back to the party 
 
Love from wall to wall. 
 
Hey DJ put us on display 
While, I'm freaking on love, every which way 
Now you're, sweating our gear and ah sweating. Our grammar 
Now-a-days everyone they wants to be a bammer 
Now Fee. Is our manager cause Cat Mandu 
He hit me on the hip about a gig in Honolulu, 
, 
Niggas, you's tripping.. You know what I'm saying this party is weak.. Hahaha.
You know what I'm saying: Nigga like me: gots to be worldwide., You know money
in, my pocket trying to rocket. Niggas is trying to flow.. Let'S go., Take us to
the airport
