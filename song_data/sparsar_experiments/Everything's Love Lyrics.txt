Everything's Love Lyrics
by Questionmark Asylum.


Ever since back in the days things changed.
We got a record deal now things rearrange.
Rearrange how true.
Cause everything I wear is design.
I sit back in my leather seats pop in my tape and recline.
Baby is pumping in my system.
Love we getting jiggy by the way my name is Digge.
The Mistafiss be I.
I'm fly.
You try.
Denied to me but tonight I'll be the one who keeps on passing you by.
Step into my sec give me a second or two.
Give me your number.
Here's my number in case ya wonder.
You know I'm living large, check me out.
I'm chill.
I guess you didn't know that I'm that Bamma from the Ville.

No she didn't.
So let's forget the kitten.
No time to stumble all over a line that's already been bitten.
Man forget it.
I guess she wasn't down with the Q.
So then we swing to another scene to start the rendezvous.

Everything is love.

We stepped outside.
Chilling with this groupie type chick.
With lots of gold, resembling my man Slick Rick.
Where you at? Right.
Where ya been? Right.
Where you at? Right.
Tell me how it is right.

I slap palms with Digge Doms.
Disarming the alarm.
Mistafiss is in bliss within the cellular phone.
See, I'ma swing by tell Ding I'll maybe even bring my.
Black custom made double deuce slang cruiser.
Moola.
Who makes the moola?
Stoned in a trance like a glace from Medusa.
Through the rear view paranoia got me peaking.
Smoke ? like Uncle Ben for no reason.
Never shall I wonder, never shall I need.
Caught up in the game while I'm trying to succeed.
? video, now the whole city know.
Everything's love.
Yo it's the poor in swole.
Dollars I fold.
I'm in front of your building let's be ready to roll.
Ayo my man who's ready to scoop me in the black Land'.
Is you foul boy?
But no ?
See everything's love.
But not so fast cuz.
Not until I get myself ? to finish the job.
Then peace to the 8 Square Mob and yo we outtie.
Rosta bust a U and head straight for the fucking party.

Everything's love.

Now back to the party.

Love from wall to wall.

Hey DJ put us on display.
While I'm freaking on love every which way.
Now you're sweating our gear and ah sweating our grammar.
Now-a-days everyone they wants to be a bammer.
Now Fee is our manager cause Cat Mandu.
He hit me on the hip about a gig in Honolulu.

Niggas you's tripping. You know what I'm saying, this party is weak. Hahaha..
You know what I'm saying? Nigga like me gots to be worldwide. You know, money.
in my pocket, trying to rocket. Niggas is trying to flow. Let's go. Take us to.
the airport.
