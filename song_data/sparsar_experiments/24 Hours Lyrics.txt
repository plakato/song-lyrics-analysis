24 Hours Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


I said “no, I'm tired”; they say “yes you can.
Push me to the fire, they say that you're the man.
I said no I'm tired”; they say “yes you can.
Push me to the fire, they say that you're the man.

Toast to the new age supermen.
And fly around the globe.
And leave home, to do shows.
Our 24 hours is a week for most.
Toast to the new age supermen.
And fly around the globe.
And leave home, to do shows.
Aw, 24 hours is a week for most.

I gotta smile even when I feel let down.
I just gotta live ready.
I put the world on my shoulders before I left out.
Shit, way too heavy....
How dare you be tired, let alone stressed out?
Man, you're on the telly..
And how can you moan about rollin' around?
Ain't you got a Bentley?
Let me show you where I get lost.
When I get picked up and I jet off.
And I get picked up when I get off.
Straight to hotel like Get washed.
Do interviews and press shots,.
Then I hit the venue get my Wretch on.
Feelin' hungry lookin' at the restaurant.
But we gotta rush for our flight.
Gotta get gone.

And I get picked up when I get off.
And I do a few photos with some new press.
Trying to sound alive when I feel like death.
Don't know what I need more, food or rest?
Bein' rude ain't Wretch so I've gotta take a picture.
I'm with y'all when I ain't even with ya.
Said follow me back my only problem with that.
Is that my battery's flat, there's no twitter.
No twitter, no BB.
In the back of car the new ET.
I wanna phone home, believe me.
But I can hear in your tone that you need me.
It's ironic that I spoke to the sun.
Before I spoke to my son.
Looks like I'm gettin scared of familiar voices.
And that's somethin that I'm really annoyed with.
It's like the things that seem to mean most.
Just end up one of my a million choices.
So how do I how avoid this?
Without hearing your pointers?

You're the man.

That sleep in the car felt like a few hours.
It was just a few minutes.
And I reach for my Red Bull to get some power.
But I forgot it was finished.
Went straight into makeup to get that powder.
For that fake star image.
Now go look alive, then they throw me my mic.
And I'mma straight up kill it.
Ladies say I got gorgeous cheeks.
Smile for the pictures before I leave.
My head's been spinning since 4 or 3.
So after the flash I see four of me.
The whole team's spirits like a cord I see.
Just find the first place and it's soon on me.
One more PA, then we all can sleep.
That 24 hours was an awesome week.

That 24 hours was an awesome week.

That 24 hours was an awesome week.

Welcome to the darkest alley.
Happiness seems so saddenin'.
How are you standing?

Welcome to the darkest alley.
Happiness seems so saddenin'.
How are you standing?
The hunger's gonna feed you action.
