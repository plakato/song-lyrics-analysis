24 Hours Lyrics
by Gucci Mane.


I'M up 24 hours money and the power
Stunting on the hoes and I'm shitting on the cowards
I'm up 24 hours, I'm 24 hours, I'm up 24 hours
No shit, shave or shower
Until. I get my money. Back
I got ta, get my money up
I'm up 24 hours

Its Gucci Nigga 
How that sound Cori

Damn, its a good day., Damn its a good day
Call, Drumma Boy and told him lets go make a hood. Tape
First thang Ima do pull out my 7'4
Candy coated black things sittin on them. Forgios
24 towers 8 bricks of powder
 10 bales of dro
What. I payed for the flour
Don't talk about my Lambo talk about my Rarri
Talk about my Phantom talk about my Harley
Brick Squad. Biker boy angel named Charlie
Dudes, going psycho white boy, gnarly
Every 24 seconds. Passin me, the marley
Lames tryna diss dont effect me hardly

Its, Gucci, 

Im goin to the bank again make another deposit
Its gettin kinda chilly, bring my minks up out. Tha closet
Gettin kinda warm get my jewerly out the safe
If. It be a problem, put the hater in his place
Im slicker than a oil spill
Sharper than a razor
Im screamin. Anybody get it like my nigga Magor
Finna cop, a condo and fill it up with ammo
Brick Squad Bandana on, I think Im, fuckin, Rambo
Its, Gucci
I'm a killer, so don't push me
Brick Squad, ain't, no pussy, niggas
Runnin, wit, dem wig, splittas
Niggas, screamin roll one
Gucci. Let me hold some
But. I can't let you hold none
I hit, you wit, the whole drum

Im fuckin wit, a white girl. You can call me Ice-T
Cause, I got my crystals on. You can call em Spike. Lee
Robbin me unlikely last try I drop em
Hollow tip stopped. Em
I ain't have time to box him
Stuntin like an actor
Runnin like an athlete
Strait to the money like a sprinter at a track meet
First signed Waka, then I signed
Gucci
Then, I sign Brick Squad. Tell em come sue. Me
