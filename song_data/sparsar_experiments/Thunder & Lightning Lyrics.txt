Thunder & Lightning Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

I don't care, I don't care.
Leave their corpses in my underwear.
I don't care.
Leave their corpses in my underwear.

Smoke plumes become clouds.
You just blend in.
Tu vas et tu.
Et tu viens.

I don't care, I don't care.
Leave their corpses in my underwear.
I don't care, I don't care.
Leave their corpses in my underwear.
