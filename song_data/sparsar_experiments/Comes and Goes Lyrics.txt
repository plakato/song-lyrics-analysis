Comes and Goes Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

People keep talking about me.
I don't ever hear what they're sayin'.
You best move on without me.
All I'm gonna do is keep delayin'.
My strength my confidence, my common sense, my money's gone.
My soul I sing my songs, we've moved along now something's wrong.
I got a problem with the daylight.

He told me follow with a straight right.
It ain't right but it ain't like I ain't tryin'.
Hard to be a star in the sunshine.
I need the night lines in the night time.
Found when she left me lost was my right mind.
So I write rhymes reaching for my lifeline.
Who wants to be a millionaire anyway?
I'm a penny away from making pennies a day.
So lend me your ear and I'mma take it away.
Never pay you back with the shit that I say.
I'll get it by tomorrow give me something today.

It comes and goes.
I heat it up and it froze.
I need the sun when it snows.
Don't ask me why I don't know.
I know it comes and goes.
I build it up and it falls.
I tear it down when it grows.
Don't ask me why I don't know.

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

Now there's a church and a mosque and a temple.
Had faith but it ain't that simple.
They use a symbol to get us assembled.
Does fear in a God make us trust a devil?
I'mma get well sitting by the citadel.
Sip a bottle of Jack and wish on the wishing well.
Then I catch a tale, everyone a fairy tale.
I'm feeling alright, yeah motherfucker read the grail.
Cause they blind to the fact that the fact is the mind ain't aligned.
With the nature in divine.
Only I can define what is yours what is mine.
What is God made of hate? got mad at mankind.
Cause mankind ain't made of kind man.
Yet I'll come in lookin for the next day back, yo.
But all my money's on the table can I have another hit?

I ain't myself at all, can't save myself at all.
From fantasy to reality my dreams are nightmares I believe.
I ain't myself at all, can't save myself at all.
From fantasy to reality my dreams are nightmares I believe.
I ain't myself at all, can't save myself at all.
From fantasy to reality my dreams are nightmares I believe.
I ain't myself at all, can't save myself at all.
From fantasy to reality my dreams are nightmares I believe.

I don't know, I don't know.
I ain't myself at all, can't save myself at all.

I don't know, I don't know.
I ain't myself at all, can't save myself at all.

I don't know, I don't know.
I ain't myself at all, can't save myself at all.

I don't know, I don't know.
I ain't myself at all,.
