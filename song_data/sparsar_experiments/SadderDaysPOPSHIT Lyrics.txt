SadderDaysPOPSHIT Lyrics
by Zippo Hebs.


Girl, I see you with my eyes closed.
And go to sleep with em open.
Remember when I tried to overdose?
On benzos and quetiapine?

Remember when you said my music sucked?
Now I'm banging shit that's better than those fucking rocks you bought.
Lines are cut with chalk, chop em and snort em off of the countertop.
We're all alone molly's in my nose and it's getting hot.

Subtract your clothing from your body you're a goddess, I'ma eat that pussy.
like it's royal, or oval office.
Sweating steady progress, I'm aiming to make you fall off, the bed and yell my.
name at the loudest that you can call it.

Interlude:.
After fuckin we ain't nothing but friends....
Come again.

Sellin some drugs, run up in the club, start shootin it up like montana.
Coked up, soon as I'm outta my mind, pop in a full clip a banana, totin a.
hammer.
Like fuck all the rules, we gotta be dangerous that's how we do.
Lookin for molly, don't think she'll come through, cause all my connects.
locked up like the soo.
13 bugatti, roll on 22's, that's chrome, just like that heat to your dome.
, go home.
If you can't fuck with my crew than you better stay sly like stone, this is.
my.
Fam this shit is my jam,.
i am exactly where i feel at home, I got my bammer.
Mylanta and xan for when I be missin my Nana, for sales of the wax and the hash.
Lean and the beans, plus an ounce in the trunk, bout to get my velveeta.
Strapped with the bands and strapped with the heater, first make her dance,.
then I'ma eat her.
Hop in the crowd and scream out the lyrics, promise you'll follow along when.
you hear it.
I'm askin the mirror who's fairest, me, I ain't been this Bueller since Paris.

Pop somethin if you ain't feelin love.
Pop somethin if you ain't feelin love.
Whether drugs or a gun, whether drugs or a gun, just.
Pop somethin if you ain't feelin love.
