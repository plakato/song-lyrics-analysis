Fire and Water Lyrics
by Ace Frehley.

Every single day I got a heartache coming my way.
I don't wanna say goodbye baby.
But look at the tears in my eyes.
I don't wanna say goodbye mama.
But look at the way you made me cry.
Every way that's nice you show.
You've got a heart that's made of ice.
And I know.

Fire and water.
Must have made you there daughter.
You've got what it takes.
To make a poor man's heart break.
A poor man's heart break.

Lover you turn me on.
But quick as a flash your love is gone.
Baby I'm gonna leave you now.
But I'm gonna try and make you grieve somehow.

Fire and water.
Must have made you there daughter.
You've got what it takes.
To make a poor man's heart break.
A poor man's heart break.
And my heart is breaking....

I don't wanna say goodbye baby.
But look at the tears you made me cry.
Every way that's nice you show.
You've got a heart that's made of ice.
And I know.

Fire and water.
Must have made you there daughter.
You've got what it takes.
To make a poor man's heart break.
Fire fire and water.
Must have made you there daughter.
You've got what it takes.
To make a poor man's heart break.
