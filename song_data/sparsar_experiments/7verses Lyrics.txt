7verses Lyrics
by Rx.

Im goin in on this, some would say ham.
Im blazed for the golory, hallelujah, goddamn.
Im takin this rap game, takin money like scams.
Ready your cameras, I got big plans.

Im on a race to be the best, call it armstrong.
Im on top of the empire, call me king kong.
I am perfect, can do no wrong.

The beat, I attack that, you just a wack rap.
Ridin in a hatchback, sportin my fuckin snapback.
Stickin to the damn back.
You want a piece of me, heres my motherfuckin sack.

A2K All day, no way.
Sportin 5degreesOff all day.
This rap is just the foreplay.
Demo tapes keep me healthy, SoBe.

You keep me on your mind like a bad thought.
All those scribbles you wrote, theyre shot.
Take it from me, im all you got.
You been exposed as wack, you been caught.

Rappin been old, im too cold.
My sick flow, will end it yo.
Keep playin as if you dont know.
Yall actin, you so slow.

On the topic of spittin.
I still got a dick that needs a little ticklin.
Ill fry you on a track, mcdonlds chicken.
My words are tasty, like finger lickin.
