Its Sad Boy Lyrics
by Yung Gleesh.


Hya.
Ayo what you staring at.
Hya.
Look back sometime.

Lean.
Lean by the bottle.
Goop by the bottle.
Who go full throttle.
Boof by the bag boy, it's sad.
boy.
It's Sad Boy.
SWITZERLAND BANK ACCOUNT.
Take 10 of my bitches out, five Benzes now, one Jag boy, it's sad boy.
We in the mansion now.
Got all of my bands is out.
Bad bitch be dancing now.
No friends allowed.
It's Sad Boy, Sad Boy.
Woke up this morning.
Got myself together.
Can't pick which car I'm using boy.
Its Sad boy, sad boy.

Woke up in Sweden.
Pushed a button to the Trump Towers.
Chicago.
The presidential suite.
Trap house at Waldorf, but.
ain't shit sweet.
I'm geechy than a motherfucker, come fuck Gleesh.
For a nigga the situation off.
the lean.
Hopped off the plane in Sweden touch down.
And I pictured the swisher to Yung Lean.
She so pretty she switchin; she so mean.
I'm in Sweden with swishers and codeine.
I'm in vogue but i'm shooting boudeen.
Holdin' on to the lexus truck leave the whole thing.
Bought my intention to switch it to caffeine.
Block it to work it cocaine.
Figity my nigga wanna pick up the trigger.
Another blocks with the bitches.
This shit is bigger.
A lot of work.
A lot of a work.
I had to work it in the kitchen.
I had a black ski mask with a black mad chicken.
Goin' through these bitches doe I can run away zoe.
Black in the pits um oh.
I get whatever I want.
I can never like it.
I can't fantasize.
I can't never lie.
Haha ha aha.
West side every side.
I got everybody.
One time two time three time that's right.

Cloud Smoke, Yellow Diamonds.
Its up in the sky where you can't find me.
Outback.
Knight Rider.
Bitch I'm masterful you can't deny me.
Neo-knife.
Bright shining.
Alone in this world.
Please don't remind me.
When the lighting strikes.
Papers flying.
I'm youngin with my team.
fuckin' don't remind me.
Lights out.
Iced Out.
Somewhere up in space.
Can't tell what time is.
Bright lights.
Night grinding.
Death already behind me.
I mean I'mma sad boy.
Got a SWITZERLAND BANK ACCOUNT.
See me up errywhere.
Throwing money.
Flying out.
Different state.
Different day.
Sad boys up on errything.
Tell it to my bank account.
You know we up on errything.
Couple hundred on my teeth.
Bapesters on my feet.
I wake up and my mind is too deep.

YUNG LEAN BITCH.
