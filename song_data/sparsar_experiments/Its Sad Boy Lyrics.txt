Its Sad Boy Lyrics
by Yung Gleesh.


Hya 
Ayo, what you staring at 
Hya, 
Look back sometime, 
, 
Lean 
Lean by the bottle 
Goop by the bottle. 
Who go full throttle 
Boof by the bag boy, it's sad

It's, Sad Boy. 
Switzerland BANK ACCOUNT 
Take 10 of my bitches out five Benzes. Now one Jag boy. It'S sad boy 
We in the mansion now 
Got, all of my bands is out 
Bad bitch be dancing now. 
No friends allowed 
It's Sad Boy, Sad Boy, 
Woke up this morning, 
Got myself together, 
Can't pick which car I'm using boy; 
Its, Sad boy, sad boy, 
, 
Woke up in Sweden, 
Pushed a button to the Trump Towers; 
Chicago 
The presidential, suite 
Trap house at Waldorf, but
ain't shit, Sweet 
I'm geechy than a motherfucker come fuck Gleesh 
For a nigga. The situation, off
the lean 
Hopped off the plane in Sweden, touch down 
And. I pictured the swisher to Yung Lean 
She, so pretty she switchin
