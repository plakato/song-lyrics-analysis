415 Lyrics
by 415.


Richie Rich is a factor, a mack, not an actor.
Who lounges in the cut and waits just to jack the.
Punks who superficially write.
Procrastinate, perpetrate, they just bite.
I don't really give it much thought, just wax em.
Page the posse, grease the Uzis, tax em.
And lift up out of there, casualties to rest.
Get in the Cutlass, drop the gat and the vest.
Have you ever seen a Vogue tire smoke?
Straight on a mission, man, I ain't no joke.
See, this is a hype tip, cause in the O that's how we do this.
Handlin boys and punks, I thought you knew this.
Gangster's bread on a day-to-day basis.
And then the punk police, they try to face this.
Form of high rollers just walkin the street.
Ain't pumped in a year and just because of the heat.
The money still long, just livin lavish.
Cause see, the boys in the Oak, they gotta have this.
Cause it takes money to survive.
And the hustlers are a product of the 415.

The 4, the 1, the 5.
-- Bootsy Collins.
The 4, the 1, the 5.

Now see, the 415 is a district.
Should I break it down? Man, I'll get specific.
First of all we'll hit turfs.
I'll explain, then you can take for what it's worth.
Down in the Nineties, 96 to be exact.
Lips, Disco, Big Ren and the pack.
Big Tim, Ice Tee and Chuck D and the crew.
They're all from the school, yes the old and new.
But 99th yeah, the big rock.
Plymouth, boy, the old narc spot.
A lot of brothers now high rollers with fame.
The Dirt Road is the block they taught on the game.
Now this shot's for the Village and Big Fee.
Rest in peace and be strong, Young D.
They can take you from the game but not the game from you.
And peace to my homies from the 69 Crew.
On 85th we got Genie and Big E.
Big Nate and F.r.o.g.
Straight old schoolers, pioneers to the game.
And in the day 85 Vets was the name.
Now 77, Big B and the click.
The storefront, beatin brothers with sticks.
Ty-Ty, E, the Twins and Long Tone.
Damn, it feels good to talk about home.
Now Rosedale, this is a street to me.
Unknown in the Town, come through, you gettin beat.
Cause Shan ain't trippin and neither is Prince.
You don't believe me, come through - you'll be convinced.
Now let's take a stroll through the park.
Sobrante, man yeah, just before dark.
Hustlers hustle and everybody O.G.
You ain't family, it ain't the place to be.
I got my top down ridin through.
I see my partners, Frog, Ron and Boo.
We're in a Cougar tryin to get with the hoes.
Twice blue, white insides, gold Zeniths and Vogues.
And the girls we were jockin were live.
But man, that's how we do it in the 415.

To me gettin with a girl means givin up the digits.
And maybe tomorrow I come over for a visit.
And if you ain't with it, then I'll just forget it.
I threw you the line and baby girl, I thought you bit it.
So if you weren't choosin, they why were you jockin?
Kenwood system and the Zeus keeps knockin.
Yeah, the paint's candy, yeah, Mico sprayed it.
Gold ones and Vogues, admit it, you been persuaded.
Just another hot one to add to the chart.
To the spot to get some Endo, hit the room before dark.
Man, she threw it on me, I started to like her.
And never thought that down the line that I'd have to strike her.
See, the 415 hoes will make you get ruthless.
Bumpin their gums and now the hoes come up toothless.
Cause in the O only the strong survive.
And Richie Riche is a factor in the 415.

You see, Rich is a mack man, I'm flowin off the top now.
It's like this, I'm gonna bust a freestyle.
The J, the e, the d, the man that's producin me.
It's like this, I'm in the place to be.
I got Daryl in the back, spinnin tables, not wack.

You see, the Oakland Town brothers keep poppin.
And MC Richie Rich is rappin, cold hip-hopppin.
I'm not sweatin it, man, I'm just flowin.
Just to let the people know that I'll keep goin.
Oakland, California, that's where I'm based.
And the brothers out here say this is the place.
You see, the crew gets the 'Stangs, the Zeniths, the Daytons.
A brother like me, man, I'm just debatin.
On why they're shootin questions at a player.
Why do people say that Rich ain't a rhyme sayer.
Any sucker muthafucka willin to jock.
Then Richie Rich'll run his ass straight up off the block.
Back in the days, man, I used to spit lyrics.
And people used to come close, cause they liked to hear it.
Anbd now I spend em in cold '89.
Because a brother like me, I'm tryin to leave the grind.
So on this note I'm out, only this will decide.
Peace to the world from the 415.

Believe that shit.
