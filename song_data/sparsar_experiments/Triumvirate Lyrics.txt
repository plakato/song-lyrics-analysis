Triumvirate Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


She was like/ summer nights/ ridiculously hot/.
But I wonder, did she miss me or miss me not? /.
I returned/ I learned/ she yearned/ for another man/.
Truth/ she's a prostitute/ burning for summer camp/.
Type love, puppy love/ I thought I was lucky but/.
She rejected me cause I was white, ugly slut! /.
Can't you see I'm the one committed to you dear?! /.
I was drunk with love yeah like sipping a new beer/.
Writing in notebooks love, I don't text sweet nothings/.
Orgasmic/ reaction/ cause yeah the beat's coming/.
But whenever we tried to create something/ Beautiful/.
You knew to go/ my art's pain hurts to.
show/.
If artists want greatness they must take risks/.
If you don't, it's like being celibate but wanting kids/.
Yes Hiphop/ it got/ my wrist locked/ in my journal/.
Cause she's Beautiful and I hope she's eternal/.

I dance this dance/ I dance this dance/.
But I'm really taking quite a big chance/.
I dance this dance/ I dance this dance/.
But she really had me at her first glance/.
I dance this dance/ I dance this dance/.
But this is really more than a romance/.
I dance this dance/ I dance this dance/.
Three partners but only one set of hands/.

Tell all my boys “I wanna get on top of this!” /.
Then I look in her eyes like an optometrist/.
Knowledge comes quick but you wanna stay put/.
Oh lady Wisdom, she makes saints wait too, while she say ‘shush!'/.
Talking about her I have all this adrenaline/.
But when my mouth opens, speech impediment/.
Man! she's more beautiful than all the glass sculptures/.
She more beautiful than all the world's cultures/.
Yo she's not just nice, smart and pretty/.
She's more designed than the art of Leonardo Da vinci/.
Lyrics I can control, you I can't handle/.
Seeing you, like seeing the Discovery channel/.
Cause I can't look away I'm fascinated/.
They can try but eh the moment can't be narrated/.
Seeing you is like seeing a half-crescent moon/.
I like what I've seen but I want to see more, soon/.

Seven things God hates: an arrogant look, a lying tongue/.
Two wicked hands that shed innocent blood/.
With a gun/ an evil heart that devises wicked schemes /.
And runs /quickly down evil paths with ease/.
For fun/ lies under oath as a witness/.
Someone/ who breaks friends apart for business/ yes this shit is/.
Not beautiful/ I hope it's soon to go/.
Redemption is gorgeous, and I'm in tune with her new glow/.
I finally got rid of these demons they're shunned/.
Now I stand in light of “A Thousand Splendid Suns”/.
But now watching the news channel man, is like all of life! /.
Something good comes on after all the strife/.
This ain't no soap opera/ drama/ But the revelation.
Of resurrection after death's comma/.
Cause after is hits you/ the story continues/.
After the slippery slope/ you're surprised by hope/.
It's beautiful!
