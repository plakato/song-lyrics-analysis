All About You Lyrics
by SWV.

Hey, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, it's all about you.
Oh yeah, aw yeah, yeah.

Yesterday changed my mind.
Now I see you as one of a kind.
How I really need you.
Hope you feel the same way too.
Cause if you look, you'll find.
It's me ya need in your life.

It's really not about me.
It's really all about you.

It's driving me crazy, can't figure you out.
How to keep you steady going this route.
Tell me that you feel the same.
The thought has crossed, you won't remain.
Just to think that I, could bring joy in your life.

It's really not about me.
It's really all about you.

I know what you're going through.
Every girl expects from you.
They just want to take control.
You never have to figure out.
I'm one woman who's not with that crowd.
You gotta believe me.

It's really not about me.
It's really all about you.

So I'll give you time.
To let go of what's hurting inside.

It's really not about me.
It's really all about you.
