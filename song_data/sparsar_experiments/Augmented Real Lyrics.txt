Augmented Real Lyrics
by Yung Jake.


I'm so real... but only on a screen.
I'm doing me. I'm on your scene.
Take a look around. you can see it.
It's hard to believe it.

I'm an Internet, digital entity.
That's why I'm blowing up, these hoes in to me.
These hoes so real. they just wanna feel me.
But the they can't touch me. It's not the Real D.

Get this money. digital pape- uh.
They just tryna hate bruh.
They tryna take my swag, they can have it.
And I make 'em feel like its magic.

Just open up the app mane.
I'm on your screen cause I'm a app mane.
That's what I turnt into.
I'm too turnt up..

All this lean got me feeling augmented.
Bands came in, now they all spented.
All dis green got me feeling so digital.
I'm just making nigga feel so physical.

I'm real a-a-augmented real.
I'm real a-a-augmented real.
I keep it one hundred. authentic feel.
I'm so real, augmented real.

I'm a app now. They just scan me in.
Tryna get fucked up off this Ambien.
Close your eyes, go to sleep, hoe.
She on top of me; she a freak hoe.

All this lean got me feeling all crooked.
Got me open like this book is.
Yeah, this is my zone.
My money long. like the iPhone.

I get paper man, I'm making dollars man.
And this is not a hologram.
I'm so geeked up, I can't stand straight.
This molly got me feeling on my damn face.

So dance, son, dance.
I'm with a freak bitch, she using no hands.
She back it up like she meant it.
I'm just so augmented.

I'm on my new shit updated.
And that's why niggas hate it.
I'm so gone. faded.
So if you feel me you should rate it.
