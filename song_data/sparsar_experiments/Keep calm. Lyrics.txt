Keep calm. Lyrics
by Zodiac Lyslyie.

Just be who you are ... and keep trust in yourself. Do not turn yourself into.
a person that you are not. Do not pretending like you will be okay, but.
actually you are not. Just be honest about what you're thinking about.
something or someone. Think about what will happen but do not just think about.
yourself.
