Opportunist Lyrics
by Sworn In.

You can't always change the world around you to fit your selfish needs.
I won't try to reach out to your gluttony and endless greed.
I don't need to change the fucking world.
To change you I don't need to change the fucking world.

To remain true.
I can say that I heard you loud and clear.
Every single fucking lie that you screamed in my ears.
Were you telling the truth, while you were living a lie?
Were you even aware, that I was wasting my time?

I can say I heard you loud and clear.
I hear you loud and clear.
I hate the way you cling to ignorance.
And pass it off as innocence.

You're just a worthless opportunist.
I hate the way you cling to ignorance.
And pass it off as innocence.

You're just scum like all the rest.
I'll take this opportunity to be the person I should be.
And I hope that one day you'll grow up and see.
The cold hearted truth that.

We are all alone at heart.
Just trying to find our way out of the dark.
Maybe were meant to be this way from the start.

But I know one thing and it's that I don't have to be an opportunist like you.
To climb to the top of this worthless earth.
I will never be an opportunist like you.
