All Wound Up Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Kevin DuBrow -- Carlos Cavazo -- Frankie Banali - Bob Pavao.

Got an active imagination.
Just one look, I've got it bad.
Got a dose of your inspiration.
Hang 'em high, salute the flag.

Come on babe, don't I know you.
Come on girl, lend a hand.
'Cos I'm all wound up, down on your knees.

Losing all your inhibitions.
Looks to me like heavens gate, all right.
You can see by my condition.
Hold on tight, we got it made, made, made.

Get down, assume the position.
Look out before I lose control.
'Cos I'm all wound up, down on your knees.
'Cos I'm all wound up, got what you need.

Looks to me like we're in business.
Close the deal, it's time to go - get on home.
Seems to me by your reaction.
You must have already loved the show oh no.

Come on babe, don't I know you.
Come on girl, lend a hand.
'Cos I'm all wound up, down on your knees.
'Cos I'm all wound up, got what you need.
Got what you need look out baby!

'Cos I'm all wound up.
'Cos I'm wound up tight feeling alright.
Do with, do with, do with right all right.
