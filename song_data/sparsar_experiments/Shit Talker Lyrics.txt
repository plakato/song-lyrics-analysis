Shit Talker Lyrics
by Un-Ez.


My name Un-EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ.

Yo fucking your bitch is ez.
I mean ez.
I'm trynna feature Chris Brown.
To get closer to RiRi.
Haters be like ha ha.
My ex's be like he he.
My pockets look like.
They posing for a picture.
Cheesy.
Look I'm contemplating.
How many rappers I'm slaying.
My life has been a battle with.
Satan like pastor mason.
Test my patience.
Your career.
Gone on a permanent vacation.
Ninja smoke.
Assholes poof.
Y'all can't see me.
I'm Andrea Bocelli nigga Ray charles Stevie.
Kinda like them.
Couldn't picture myself on T.V.
But y'all deserve to see me.
I came from the bottom nothing like Drake.
More like Weezy push some shhhhhh not quite Jeezy.
Had to drop outta school like Kanyeezzy.
So middle finger to the world.
That made me so Un-Ez.
After all I been through man.
This rap shit is EZ.

My name Un-EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ.
My name Un-EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ.

Anticipating my come up.
Y'all can tell them labels I'm anticipating some commas.
Cause I know that they able.
I swear to God.
I'm getting I'm getting my point across.
I know some niggas who will snatch a.
Chain if I point a cross.
And all i need a.
A few shots to get me sauce.
And a bad bitch who'll roll on a philly.
Like a bad eagles loss.
There's levels to this shit man.
Levels to this shit.
If these niggas hot I'm devil in this bitch.
Like magic in the all star game back.
In 96.
With HIV.
And still have the whole world on his dick.
Behind the back pass to myself.
I don't need your assist.
After my first LP I'll sample my own shit.
Yo I'm dumb wit it.
I am I am so hung wit it.
Leave your ass sprung wit it.
Until my lungs quitting.
Till my heart collapse.
Until until I'm done winning.
Tie my laces kinda of attitude.
If not get hung wit it.

My name Un-EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ.
My name Un-EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ.

Trynna make up for losses.
Don't judge me by my past.
We all gotta carry our crosses.
So you can kiss my ass.
Like jesus did.
He's proof that you don't gotta do wrong.
And still could serve a bid, still can serve a bid.
If not through your life through modern slavery.
Services the names Un-ez like nerviness.
A twitch inside of your heart the first time you hear me.
Murder shit.
The imperfect preciseness of michealangelo.
When i paint 16's.
Chapels my tabanaco a jungle west from the rotten apple.

If they hassle my hustle I'm ready for battle I'm leaving them baffled when we.
blitz.
Yo.
Guards are getting tackled.
Kings are getting shackled.
Bosses dictators and pharaohs.
Getting picked like an afro.
I'm coming like shots if i run.
Out of bullets I'm airing like.
Like poisonous arrows.
Aimed at they Gucci Versaci Louis apparel.
Your 60 frames per second.
Are too slow for my limitless.
Catalog arsenal rolodex.
Yes i am in control of this.
I eat Mc's.
In any order fuck a menu order all of it.

Switching lanes like a motorist in bad traffic.
All i think is dope like a fucking crack addict.
As far as this rap shit goes I'm a fucking animal.
I'll eat your face up go home and watch hannibal.
Ez.

My name Un-EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ.
My name Un-EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ EZ.
