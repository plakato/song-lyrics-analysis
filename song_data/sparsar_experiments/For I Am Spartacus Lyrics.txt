For I Am Spartacus Lyrics
by Sydney.

If I could kill with words at will.
Then in this song I'll stage your final breath.
With something soft and quiet.
And you know I'll be there till your end.

And what's with all these little things.
Always coming back around to haunt me.
You know I'll take back everything.
So why'd you waste your time.

She screams loud as her subtle words rest deep inside me.
Nothing could ever stop you, nothing would ever stop you.
So I'll sing loud hope the subtle words rest deep inside you.
Because that's what you wanted, that's what you wanted.

End this silence don't even think its bad for you.
Lets take this violence and turn it into something we can use.
Don't you hate the way it hurts to say my name?
And don't you love the way I hate to play this game?
If everything that's good is bad for you then why'd you waste your time.

She screams loud as her subtle words rest deep inside me.
Nothing could ever stop you, nothing would ever stop you.
So I'll sing loud hope the subtle words rest deep inside you.
Because that's what you wanted, that's what you wanted.

She screams loud as her subtle words rest deep inside me.
Nothing could ever stop you, nothing would ever stop you.
So I'll sing loud hope the subtle words rest deep inside you.
Because that's what you wanted, that's what you wanted.
