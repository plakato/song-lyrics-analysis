Check 1
by Sycosis.

Check 1, 2.

Call me S-Y mind right music/.
I'm that dude man, cool as a blue fan/.
Check 1, 2.

I've been slept on too long/.
Like your cheeks with the sheet marks in it/.
Cape off feeling I could be Clark Kent if/.
Nobody notice, didn't have a vision now I'm Lasik focused/.
Third eye closing, flow wet soaking/.
Crowd in control like I hit ‘em with a potion/.
Spitting with a venom that's potent/.
Doors of the church is open, it's devotion/.
Our father, Sergeant Slaughter/.
Jake the Snake Roberts, hate the fake prophets/.
Easy bake pockets, that mean I get cake/.
Dick let me dictate, how much she can dick take/.
I switch gears, never did breaks, move forward/.
Try to live great, die better, who for it/.
All against it get crushed in the process/.
Coupes like girls gone wild, all topless.

Gotta stop one day but not right now/.
Don't ask me who I think is hot right now/.
Cuz if I see him, probably getting shot right now/.
Erase his name from the top I want his spot right now/.
Raise your cups in the air like the Blackhawks/.
All these niggas fronting like someone ripped they back off/.
It's all good though I keep it 100/.
Like an ‘A' in gym class, nigga, we the ones who run it/.
S-y-cosis power of suggestion/.
Give ‘em lethal doses, all an injection/.
Land mine rhymes, too explosive/.
Needle for a pen, don't get poked, bitch/.
Cuz I ain't playing, not the least homie/.
Get a wooden bed box if you sleep on me/.
And watch your mouth if you speak on me/.
Talking to the young God, so preach on me.

I brought it back for the people/.
Real Rap part two starring in the sequel/.
My headphones is on fire, Siegal, Jada/.
Haters all around but I keep cool/.
Like I'm laced in nitrous oxide/.
Chilling in the cut, real clean like peroxide/.
Can't touch me like hammer, I'mma nail you.
Hard to act hard when your heart start to fail you/.
What can I tell you, just a shorty from the Chi/.
Been playing with the pen before Live ‘95/.
I had a Dreamcast, music made my dreams last/.
Pops locked up, somehow it never seemed bad/.
Still get it in today though/.
Catch me in the streets or online like Halo/.
Just thank God for the day/.
And I'mma keep pushing like a baby on the way.
