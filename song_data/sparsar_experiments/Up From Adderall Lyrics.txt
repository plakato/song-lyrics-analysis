Up From Adderall Lyrics
by Wordplay.

It's a lifestyle man, y'all don't understand me yet.
Young Word Play, young Word Play!

Up from Adderall, geeked.
like Santa Claus.
Living life on pause, you.
don't want these paws.
Niggas talking shit? All I say is aw.
Screaming fuck the law, cause Word Play set the law.

My dick in her jaw, sloppy like coleslaw.
Fucking my girl raw, no.
point in a bra.
Drugs from Bogota, snorting with a straw.
Drink like I'm from Ireland, George Bernard Shaw.
I don't have no flaws, swear I'm oh so raw.
Favorite number Sammy Baugh.

Your bitch is bourgeois, boozhie like macaws.
Flow like Jabber-Jaw, cause I'm off Adderall.

Come on bruh withdraw, cause you can't hang with us.
Sleeping off a blunt, wanna smoke with me? Hell naw!
Colder than Black Hawks, hotter than God Ra.
Wanna do some shrooms? Insha' Allah.
Snort that adderall, now I sing like Tim McGraw.
Man I love them Schedule 1's that's my tragic flaw.
Homework got me busy so I'll meet with you tomorrow.
Word Play oh so cold I'm in the sink so I can thaw.
