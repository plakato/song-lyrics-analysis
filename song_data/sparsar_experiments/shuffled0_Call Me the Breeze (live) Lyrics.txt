Call Me the Breeze (live) Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

But I don't love me no one woman.
Might go down to Georgia, I don't know.
Ain't no change in the weather.
Ain't no changes in me.
So, I can't stay in Georgia long.
Nobody's hidin' from me.
Well, I got that green light baby.
Well, I got that green light baby.
I keep blowin' down the road.
Well, now they call me the breeze.

Ooh Mr. Breeze.
I got to keep movin' on.


Well, now they call me the breeze.
I keep blowin' down the road.

I got to keep movin' on.
I don't carry me no load.
Well, there ain't no change in the weather.
Makes me feel right at home.
Well, I might go out to California.
Ain't no changes in me.
Call me the breeze.
I ain't got me nobody.
And I ain't hidin' from nobody.
Oh, and that's the way it's supposed to be.
I don't carry me no load.
Well, now I dig you Georgia peaches.
I keep blowin' down the road.
I keep blowin' down the road.
Well, I dig you Georgia peaches.
Makes me feel right at home.
Well, now they call me the breeze.

I ain't got me nobody.
