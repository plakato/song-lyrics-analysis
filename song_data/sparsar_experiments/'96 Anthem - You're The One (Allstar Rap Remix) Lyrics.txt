'96 Anthem - You're The One (Allstar Rap Remix) Lyrics
by SWV.

You're the one, I know.
That you're the one for me.
When in need, you know.
That you can call on me.
Baby, I know that you're the one for me.
You're the one.
You're the one for me.
You want me but she needs you.

Besides this ma, come out the V-2.
Keep it on the R-Kel's.
Cos my girls the type who like a fight in the club.
Go home and make love.
Though I like the way you sex somethin'.
Baby girl will wreck something.
If she knew you and I were in the Lex fronting.
A bottle of Cru, the crews about to make moves.
Rendezvousing, hotel debuting.
Lover forget then fled the scene.
Smelling like wet dreams, lipstick around the collar.
Thinking about bed-screams and the way you holla.
Boo, you make a nigga rise like tax on the dollar.
No, you ain't no trick.
Can't play you like a zero.
Gave you a couple of chips for spending time with the hero.
To the next time baby girl, never forget.
You can't be with the one you love, love the one you with.
I'm knowing....

You're the one, I know.
That you're the one for me.
When in need, you know.
That you can call on me.
Baby, I know that you're the one for me.
You're the one.
You're the one for me.

Now I know it seems strange because I just met ya.
But on the low, before we spoke, I was out to get ya.
Matter of fact I heard you had a man, but that I understand.
Now if you seperate, now dig this, I'm your biggest fan.
Besides, everything you said is stuck in my head.
So come inside my spa room and lay me close to bed.
And let me bless you with the butters that's from the gutters.
Don't let anybody blow the spot up, we got others.
That's on the low, the home that we there for.
You know that sparks turn to flames girl so therefore.
We must creep and keep it tight, and do it right.
My chick would die if she knew how we screw at night.
So let's keep it on the low, so no-one else can know.
And you could wreck them in the swerve game, fast low.
And even though we creeping, I've begun to see.
That I'm the one for you and shorty, your the one for me.

You're the one, I know.
That you're the one for me.
When in need, you know.
That you can call on me.
Baby, I know that you're the one for me.
You're the one.
You're the one for me.

Yo, and if you ain't the bangest chick I ever saw.
Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya.
From the ceiling to the floor.
I look from top to bottom.
Analyse the middle with your little cleavage and your drawers.
Everything remains raw baby.
I love the way you strut.
When you walk by got a wide angle lens focused on your butt.
Complection looks mixed with black and polish.
Caramel, city, stacking bone naked walking tippy toe-ish.
Amazing Leanne got my heart pumping.
Whole entire body cocked on diesel like we running track or something.
I knew that you were the one for me.
Word is bond on Flipmode and S.W.V.
Got the opportunity.
To see how sutible and beautiful you is when you do your nails and your.
cuticles.
Just stay sharp love, word on my son.
Let it manifest for sure that you're the one.

You're the one, I know.
That you're the one for me.
When in need, you know.
That you can call on me.
Baby, I know that you're the one for me.
You're the one.
You're the one for me.

Smoothe Da Hustler + Trigger Tha Gamber.

Let the sex tell, join me cause I ain't waiting for no exhale.
I move on, stay fly to keep my groove on.
It's hard to walk over me so you wonder why your shoes gone.
For me to leave her? Your kidding.
But it was times when you had be down with the fo-pound that she didn't.
You saw me hittin, that's why you eying me.
I know you love me thuggin' it.
I peeped it written it in your diary.
In red, God bless my soul regardless, the heartless and cold.
She gonna be the one.
I ain't lyin'.
I told you, when my girl ain't around I mould you.
Shape you into my queen, just to hold you.
We won't expose you, keep it D.L like R.Kelly.
With Smoothe Da Huster, a Nexx Level G across ya belly.
Nexx Level, Brooklyn Brown Ville - Mr Trigger.
Aced, lost, like vigga, that same dime-pieced getter.
You're The One - Allstar Remix.
With Lelee, Coko and Taj.
My three gold card international enterage.

You're the one, I know.
That you're the one for me.
When in need, you know.
That you can call on me.
Baby, I know that you're the one for me.
You're the one.
You're the one for me.
