'96 Anthem - You're The One (Allstar Rap Remix) Lyrics
by SWV.

You'Re, the one I know - 
That you're, the one for me 
When in need. You know 
That, you can call on me 
Baby. I know that you're, the one for me 
You're, the one 
You're, the one for me, 
You want me, but she needs you. 
 
Besides. This ma come out the V-2 
Keep it on the R-Kel's 
Cos my girls, the type who like a fight in the club, 
Go home, and make love 
Though. I like the way you sex, somethin', 
Baby girl, will wreck something 
If. She knew you and I were in the Lex fronting 
A bottle of Cru. The crews about to make moves. 
Rendezvousing, hotel, debuting 
Lover, forget then fled the scene 
Smelling like wet dreams, lipstick around the collar 
Thinking about bed-screams and the way you holla 
Boo. You make a nigga rise like tax on the dollar. 
No. You ain't no trick. 
Can'T play you like a zero 
Gave. You a couple of chips for spending time with the hero 
To, the next time, baby girl, never forget, 
You can't be with the one. You love love the one you with 
I'm, knowing ... 
 
You're, the one I know 
That you're, the one for me 
When in need. You know 
That, you can call on me 
Baby. I know that you're, the one for me 
You're, the one 
You're the one. For me, 
 
Now, I know it seems strange because I just met ya 
But on the low before we spoke, I was out to get ya 
Matter of fact. I heard you had a man but that I understand 
Now. If you seperate now dig this, I'm your biggest fan, 
Besides, everything you said is stuck in my head: 
So come inside my spa room and lay me close to bed 
And. Let me bless you with the butters, that's from the gutters 
Don't. Let anybody blow the spot up. We got others 
That's on the low the home that we there for 
You know that sparks turn to flames girl. So therefore 
We must creep and keep it tight and do it right, 
My chick would die if she knew how we screw at night 
So. Let'S keep it on the low, so no-one else can know 
And. You could wreck them in the swerve game, fast, low, 
And. Even though we creeping I've begun to see 
That, I'm the one for you and shorty your the one for me, 
 
You're, the one I know 
That you're, the one for me 
When in need. You know 
That, you can call on me 
Baby. I know that you're, the one for me 
You're, the one 
You're, the one for me, 
 
Yo, and if you ain't the bangest chick, I ever saw 
Ya Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, 
From, the ceiling to the floor. 
I, look from top to bottom 
Analyse, the middle with your little cleavage and your drawers 
Everything remains raw baby 
I love the way you strut 
When, you walk by got a wide angle. Lens focused on your butt. 
Complection looks mixed with black and polish 
Caramel city stacking bone naked, walking, tippy toe-ish 
Amazing Leanne got my heart pumping 
Whole entire body cocked on diesel like we running track or something 
I knew that you were the one for me. 
Word is bond on Flipmode and S.W.V. 
Got the opportunity 
To see how sutible and beautiful you is when you do your nails and your
cuticles 
Just stay sharp love word on my son 
Let. It manifest for sure that you're, the one 
 
You're, the one I know 
That you're the one for me 
When in need. You know 
That, you can call on me 
Baby. I know that you're, the one for me 
You're, the one 
You're, the one for me -
