Wait, wait. What did you say about minimum wage 
-That's? That'S the money. I need.. That'S It., 
Minimum wage

I'm, really trying to understand. Why would you aspire to just earning minimum
wage 
-Why? Should I aspire for more 
I know why you should aspire to more trust, me. There's a lot out there. You
Can do with money., But I'm trying to understand why anyone would aspire to
minimum wage minimum-, 
-It's, not aspiring I'm taking it.. I can do more. I know I can get more 
Okay, so why wouldn't you get more 
-Cause? I don't want to cause. I don't need it.
