Kryptonite Lyrics
by The Uncluded.

Kimya Dawson.
Just got to the airport and I don't know where to go.
Can you show me the way to Humphrey terminal?
Keep the kryptonite in your pocket, okay, bro.
Cause the doctor don't know why my heart rate won't slow.
And I'm spinning in slow motion like a ballerina.
On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to stop.

Aesop Rock.
Bought a kryptonite baggie.
And a science magazine with a yeti on the cover.
Mitigating insecurity before the worry.
Turn the skin a pretty guava color.
Water bottle gum; bobbleheaded.
Waiting for a code from the television.
Wrong terminal, wrong concourse.
Wrong gate, wrong A-27.

Overlapping Audio.
I'm spinning in fast motion like a motorcycle inside.
Of a cage sphere of death when it's about to shred.

And I'm spinning in slow motion like a ballerina.
On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to stop.
