Kryptonite Lyrics
by The Uncluded.

Kimya Dawson 
Just got to the airport and I don't know where to go 
Can. You show me the way to Humphrey terminal 
Keep, the kryptonite in your pocket, okay, bro 
Cause, the doctor. Don'T know why my heart rate won't slow, 
And. I'M spinning in slow motion like a ballerina 
On top of a kid's jewelry box when it's about to stop 
 
Aesop Rock 
Bought, a kryptonite baggie 
And, a science magazine with a yeti on the cover, 
Mitigating insecurity before the worry 
Turn, the skin, a pretty guava color 
Water bottle gum,
