It's Going Down Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

).

I knew I was being threatened.
Do you think it's worth holding out'.
I mean I've heard some pretty ugly things about those guys.
Ugly stories.

electric guitar starts.
Watch them flee.. watch them flee scratches.
Rap up scratches.
Watch them flee scratches.
Hip-Hop hits scratches.
And you do it like this.

Mike Shinoda.

It's going down.
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound.
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now.
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down.
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style.
The combination of a vocal caress.
With lungs that gasp for breath.
From emotional stress.
With special effects.
And a distorted collage.
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage.

It's going down.
The logical progression on a the timeline.
The separation narrowed down to a fine line.
To blur the edges so they blend together properly.
Take you on an audible odyssey.
Now it's going down.

Put put.. put it up scratches.
I said it goes like this scratches.
And you do it like this scratches.
It's going down.

Mike Shinoda.

Once again it is.
Composed sentences all together venomous.
The four elements of natural force.
Projected daily through the sound of the source.
Everybody on board with this blend.
The sword with the pen.
The mightiest is the weapons.
Swinging right from the chin.
The elevate of mental states.
Long gone with the wind.
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends.
It's going down.
Stalence emulation readily.
Trekking through the weaponry.
Of the pure pedigree.
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me.
Whatever the weather be.
We invent the steadily.
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high.
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots.
Execution of collaborative plots.
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop.

It's going down.
The logical progression on a the timeline.
The separation narrowed down to a fine line.
To blur the edges so they blend together properly.
Take you on an audible odyssey.
Now it's going down.

Put put.. put it up scratches.
I said it goes like this scratches.
And you do it like this scratches.
It's going down.

X-Ecutioners.
X-men 'bout to blast of world wide scratches.
Yo it's request only scratches.
X-men 'bout to blast of world wide scratches.
It's built from scratch.
Album in stores soon.
'Bout to blast off world wide scratches.
And you do it like this.

It's going down.

Put put.. put it up scratches.
I said it goes like this scratches.
And you do it like this scratches.
It's going down.

Like this....
