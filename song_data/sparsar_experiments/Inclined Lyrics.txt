Inclined Lyrics
by XFlo.


Just spitting what I know...

I'm rumbling, we get it jumping like we're bubbling.
The grounds shaking, you feel me stomping, the truth is coming.
This is ground-breaking news the Richter scale might even plummet.
You can't even sum-it, degrading ass DOWN with the dumbing.

....Dumbing, these niggas dumbing down.
This is mental intelligence, shut the ignorance down.
You lost all power, I'm dissecting the chords.
Made my own router now I'm collecting all the awards.
I'm rising! that spiral Nine, I'm gliding, just climbing.
Spreading knowledge with my peace of mind.
Cloud kicking on cloud Nine, chilly chill might freeze time...
Really real, my breeze fly and I'm THAT HIGH.

No need for me to speak about the pyramids, bitch.
Already planted the seed, FUCKED the game UP like I'm impregnating this bitch.

They say, Life's a Bitch they must be right, cus I'm losing TRACK of it.
But i keep 'her' on my chain cus I'm so immaculate.
I don't see NO competition, 'NObody' is NOnexistent....
...Just like their resistance, I'm dramatic. spi-spi-spi-spitting like I'm.
spazzing just a habit.
Twisting verbs cus i got the action, shit HAPPENS, i understand it but now I'm.
demanding.
Forceful with my tactics, we can get to clapping.
Checkmate, I'm King! throw you over BOARD, bitch I'm the captain.

I'm rumbling, we get it jumping like we're bubbling.
The grounds shaking, you feel me stomping the truth is coming.
This is ground-breaking news the Richter scale might even plummet.
You can't even sum-it, degrading ass DOWN with the dumbing.

Riddle me that, these niggas fiddle with facts.
It's a new day, a new age; Real information in rap.
My brain's thinking, ATTACK, this is no play, this 'Ole!'.
The bull's way, inclination through wordplay.
You and I are not the same, you cloning, Go figure cus this is a game.
Got that HDM3rdEye, I AM the silent assassin.
You can't assassinate, the prophecy holds my fate so I'm gonna make it happen.
bitch, i do not play.
