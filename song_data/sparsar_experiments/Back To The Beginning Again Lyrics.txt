Back To The Beginning Again Lyrics
by Switchfoot.


I can feel it building up inside.
Images that play inside my mind.
Dreams that I've been dreaming all my life.
The colors that live outside of the lines.

But dreams aren't all I hide beneath this skin.
The chord is cut, the fear, and doubts begin.
My hope is anchored on the other side.
With the colors that live outside of the lines.

And the oceans roar.
And the wheels, they spin.
And the old promises.
Bring me back, bring me back to the beginning again.

But the cold again at harbor stacks.
With the weight of these machines across my back.
I know a mountain road where time unwinds.
But I've visited it in a single fall I had.

And it all just sounds like poison on my ears.
The background noise makes your voice so hard to hear.
So I grit my teeth and straighten up my spine.
I'm stuck in traffic on the dotted yellow line.

And my heart is yours.
And what a broken place it's in.
But you're running far.
And I want to feel the wind at my back again.

Back to the beginning again.
Back to the beginning again.
I want to feel the wind at my back again.
Back to the beginning again.
Back to the beginning again.
I want to feel the wind at my back again.

And my heart is yours.
And what a broken place it's in.
But you're running far.
And I want to feel the wind at my back again.

Back to the beginning again.
Back to the beginning again.
I want to feel the wind at my back again.
Back to the beginning again.
Back to the beginning again.
I want to feel the wind.
I want to feel the wind.
I want to feel the wind at my back again.
