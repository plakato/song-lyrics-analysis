I'm Cocky Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


Woo!
Okay!
Bitches get money can't live without it.
I'm 'bout that life, heard you ain't 'bout it.
You don't know me? Bitch I doubt it!
You ain't seen my shows, them hoes be crowded.
You think you the shit, Well, you don't matter.
? its with us since I'm no actor.
I bleed this shit, ho I'm a factor.
The man above making me a rapper.

? is where I'm ?
I'ma get it!
I'm on the toilet ?
Bitch I'm shittin'!
Make a number two in the industry.
Make sure you hoes remember me.
You ain't feelin' me?
I ain't feelin' you!
Bill Gates made it, I'll make a billion, too.
Fuck a million, I'll make a billion, too.

I'm cocky.
Well not really.
But I won't stop.
Till I get a billion.
Just watch me.

You could feel it.
I got bigger dreams.
I don't need a million.
I'm cocky, I'm cocky.
Just watch me, can't stop me.
I'm cocky, I'm cocky.
Just watch me, you can't stop me.
I'm cocky, I'm cocky, I'm cocky.
Well not really.

I'm cocky, I'm cocky.
Well not really.
Top is where I'm going I'm all the way.
My money come fast like Andal√©.
Watch your mouth, your life a call away.
I'm serious, like all the way.

I ain't cocky, I just know I'm straight.
Don't gotta lie that's why they hate.
They come last I'm in first place.
Oakland raised, my birth place.
Its the jungle, its the struggle.
Pit bulls with no muscles.
I made it out, I made a mill.
I'm on now, I made a deal.

I need a billion, I need a lot.
My haters hate cause they need a spot.
Don't look at the house look at the lot.
My name ring bells, bitch I'm hot, my name ring bells, bitch I'm hot.
