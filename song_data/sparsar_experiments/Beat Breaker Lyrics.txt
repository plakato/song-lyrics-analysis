Beat Breaker Lyrics
by Zo!.

The late nite beatbraker.
Wants to look for it's own salvation.
Don't care about the outside.
Don't care if you live or die tonite.
You just wanna dance.

You just wanna dance.

The late nite beatbraker.
Wants to look for it's own salvation.
Don't care about the outside.
Don't care if you live or die tonite.
You just wanna dance.

Oh, I've lost my head again.
Oh, I've lost my head again.
Oh, I've lost my head again.

The late nite beatbraker.
Wants to look for it's own salvation.
Don't care about the outside.
Don't care if you live or die.

Oh, I've lost my head again.
Oh, I've lost my head again.
Oh, I've lost my head again.
Oh, I've lost my head again.

I don't know why you lost your mind.
I don't know what you're looking for.
I don't know why you lost your mind.
I don't know what you're looking for.

I don't know why you lost your mind.
I don't know what you're looking for.

I've lost my head.
I've lost my head.
But I keep my feet down on the ground.

I've lost my head.
I've lost my head.
But I keep my feet down on the ground.

You just wanna dance.
You just wanna dance.
You just wanna dance.
You just wanna dance.
You just wanna dance.
