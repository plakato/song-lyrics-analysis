I Call Your Name Lyrics
by Switch.


I used to think about immature things.
You know like, do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gonna call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?
But you know I'm a man now, baby, a grown man.
And I came a long way, he-he.
And experience taught me one thing.
Taught me to hold on to my love.

Sometimes.
I just can't help thinkin' livin' without you, baby.
See, sometimes, I just can't live cryin' about you, baby.

I'm not worried 'bout a doggone thing.
I'll take anything you bring.
Although I love the sunshine.
I'll still accept rain.
Cause when I'm in my lonely mood.
And I just can't be with you.
I tried everything to occupy my mind.
And there was no substitute.

Thinking all that life would be.
When you're not around.
I just could not find my way.
I wouldn't even know up from down.
But since I've had you in my life.
All thing can be found.
So strong and true, baby.
All comin' from you.

You, I call your name, girl.
I call your name.
I think of you, and it eases the pain.
Take away the strain.

Cause I don't worry what my people say.
In my life today.
Although they try to say you're not the one for me.
I'll love you anyway.
Cause their intentions might be cool.
If what they say was true.
But there's more to you than they could ever see.
And they don't even know you.

Thinking all that life would be.
When you're not around.
I just could not find a way.
I wouldn't even know up from down.
But since I've had you in my life.
All things can be found.
So strong and true, baby.
Comin' from you, you, you, you, you.

You, I call your name, girl.
I call your name.
I think of you and it eases the pain.
Take away the strain.

You, I call your name, girl.
I call your name.

I think of you and it eases the pain.

Take away the strain.

Instrumental Break.

I do, you do.
Birds and bees do too.
I love you, you love me.
And I know.
Whoa oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
I call your name and it eases the pain.

See, I just don't feel all by myself tonight.
It seems like someone else is out there.
Oh, thinkin' of holding someone else tight.
So you will know where I'm comin' from.
Oh, when I'm lonely, when I'm discouraged.
Oh, I call your name, baby.

There is no substitute for you.
No one could take your place.
You're more than they can ever receive.
That's why I call your name.

Oh, baby, when I am lonely.
When I am discouraged.
I call your name, girl.
I think of you and it eases the pain.
Take away the strain.

You, I call your name, girl.
I call your name.
I think of you and it eases the pain.
Take away the strain.

Da da di la la la la la la.
Da da di la da di da la la la la.
Da da di la da di la la la la la.
Da da di la da di da di da di da.

Da da di la da di da la la la la.
Da da da la da di da la la la la.
Da da la da di da la da la da.
Da da la da di da la da la da.

I call you, it's you, baby.
And you, baby, and you, whoa oh.
You you you you you you you you you you you.

I call your name.

I do, you do.
Birds and bees do too.
I love you, you love me.
And I know.
Whoa oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
I call your name and it eases the pain.

I call your name.
