India Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

India, India, India.
India, India, clarified butter from the holy cow.
India, India, India.
I'm a pauper bereft of spiritual vision.
Looking for a guru such a decision.
India, India, India.
Clarified butter from the holy cow.
India, India, India.
I'm a conscious consumer.
But there's nothing to consume.
Lotus flowers are still in bloom in.
India, India, India.
India, India, clarified butter from the holy cow.
India, India, India.
India, India.
India, India.
