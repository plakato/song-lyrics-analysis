Serve Somebody Lyrics
by Wolfman D.

Who wants to step to me? 
I'Ve got a secret recipe, 
To battle, anybody in the crowd, 
Trying to heckle me 
Step, away from the mike 
Lest ye, be cursed with leprosy, 
And, start cleaning, toilets, 
In the barracks for some extra cheese 
I'm, an artist 
Who's known to scar, folks 
When. I get into detail 
And, stop speaking in broad strokes, 
Chops that ass 
Like karate 
If. You keep hating on me, 
That's all right, but I'm gon na have to serve somebody. 
 
Serve somebody 
Walk up in my place: 
And, I'm dressed kind of classy 
Step up in my face, 
You get served something nasty, 
 
You, don't want to battle me 
Mc, booty,
