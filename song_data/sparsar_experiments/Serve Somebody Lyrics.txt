Serve Somebody Lyrics
by Wolfman D.

Who wants to step to me?
I've got a secret recipe.
To battle anybody in the crowd.
Trying to heckle me.
Step away from the mike.
Lest ye be cursed with leprosy.
And start cleaning toilets.
In the barracks for some extra cheese.
I'm an artist.
Who's known to scar folks.
When I get into detail.
And stop speaking in broad strokes.
Chops that ass.
Like karate.
If you keep hating on me.
That's all right but I'm gonna have to serve somebody.

Serve somebody.
Walk up in my place.
And I'm dressed kind of classy.
Step up in my face.
You get served something nasty.

You don't want to battle me.
Mc booty; I bust that.
Don't touch that.
My rhymes have rabies like lyrical muskrats.
Think you're a rebel?
I leave rappers disheveled.
Dazed in the basement.
While I'm on the top level.
They revel and sulk.
I heavily pedal my hulk-.
Esque ego, keeping MCs.

Got crooks in every little cranny and knook.

Make sure they heard how.
I'm gonna have to serve somebody.

You don't want beef.
You're a vegetarian... Really.
You'll get sliced, diced and served.
In vegetarian chilly.
I got carnivorous flows.
You're out the chopped liver bin.
I eat MCs on beats  in these streets.
I'm out to kill again.
Confidence will disapear.
So mysterious.
Rhymes so weird, you won't believe your eyes.
Cause I'm the eeriest.
Not the type to be jaded.
Because I'm hated on.
But the next dude I find hating.
Is getting waited on.
An I'mma serve somebody.
