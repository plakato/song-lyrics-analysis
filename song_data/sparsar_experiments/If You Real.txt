If You Real
by 504 Boys.

Soldiers.
Be all you can be.
This No Limit shit tho....
We in this for life.
This not just a job baby.
This an adventure, ya heard me?

Now if you real, keep it real.
But if you fake, then you phony.
Nigga.
Go join the navy.
You can't fuck with this army.

Master P.
I gave a couple niggas some tanks and I want 'em back.
Nigga sent me some beats...But I don't want that.
In '89 I had a Benz, you ain't had a buck.
I bought your only fuckin house, and your first fuckin truck.
You pawn your rolley boy?
Oh...you doin' bad?
Stop trickin' to them hoes, and you wouldn't be on your ass.
Now when times got hard.
You ran your mouth like a bitch.
Sold your soul to the devil, when you ran with other cliques.
You ain't no soldier boy.
Take that tat off your stomach.
Nigga talkin' bout he love me.
But bitch you love my money.
Now if greed come between me and my niggas.
May god bless his soul.
And I hope he forgive me.

Silkk The Shocker.
These fake niggas gon' fall off.
We gonna be around for a minute.
Thats why niggas, shoot shots and run.
We stick around and finish.
Now...see me dogg?
I'm around to win it.
And I don't fuck around with you niggas.
Stop step the fuck away from around my Bentley.
I'm bought to blow off these fake niggas head.
Sayin' whats wrong with Slim?
Them niggas fake P.
That's why theres no fuckin' songs with them.
We put our money together.
Just like we started with crack.
We let a couple niggas shine.
We bought to take it back.
You know its mic's now nigga.
We started with gats.
Let a nigga play me on the streets.
So dogg, I ain't gonna start with this rap.
Gonna let them fake niggas go.
Thats how we gonna settle down.
If we hustle we stil be rich bitch...if we never rap.

P talking till the end of the song.
