99 Lyrics

They try and look me in the eyes and tell me.
There ain't no prize to be won, no, no.
No, I've been fighting for the top, I'm ready.
All I know is I want it all, all.

Yeah, it's time to pack.
Luggage full of dreams with the tags still intact.
But the plastic's still wrapped, I haven't opened it.
With my feet up on a top floor screaming Jesus.
But I want more, it's all good, though.
This feel like that blow a pound with my dawgs on my Suge flow.
They love me in the hood, so.
Shout out Macivan spreading CD's round the discount mall like a virus.
Bosses choking, hope your employees know how to do the heimlich.
Left the bullshit way behind like Kirk Hinrich.
I'm the first of my kind, ain't no doubt about it.
Slightly schizophrenic, I'm in the studio with myself.
There's still a crowd around.
Think I finally found the youth, it's in the truth.
Since 50 rocked the vest, I had the jukes.
With my feet up on a top floor screaming Jesus.
But I want more.

I won't stop until I hear the world scream my name out, name out.
Who you are is what you do, not what you say.
I bring the bang out, bang out.
Oooo, I'm popping, oooo, I'm popping.
Oooo, I'm popping, oooo, I'm popping.

I made a promise to myself in '99.
Not to shoot for the sky would've been my biggest crime.
Sifted through my teens, growing now, I got a dream going.
People said you sick for believing so I sneezed on 'em.
Spent the rest nights focused on the lights.
Aim for the stars, cock back, open flight.
Then I got caught, hot fingerprints on the shotgun.
List of success suspects and I'm the top one.
You could see me ?, getting ?
You could call my momma, if you ask, she'd admit that.
Climbing from the bottom, got grit ?
But the shooter in the pit cause she fit.
So please don't pity me, you see me holding keys.
I always like to tease, won't be the bitch to appease.
Soon the hoes come running and the checks start coming.
But I'm in it for the height, not the summit.

I won't stop until I hear the world scream my name out, name out.
Who you are is what you do, not what you say.
I bring the bang out, bang out.
Oooo, I'm popping, oooo, I'm popping.
Oooo, I'm popping, oooo, I'm popping.

I made a promise to myself in '99.
I was gonna shine.
I made a promise to myself in '99.
I was gonna shine.
I made a promise to myself in '99.
I was gonna shine.
I made a promise to myself in '99.
I was gonna shine.
I made a promise to myself in '99.
That I'd get real big, open up a few minds.
I made a promise to myself in '99.
I was gonna shine.
