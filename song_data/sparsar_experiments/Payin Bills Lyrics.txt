“Paying Bills” by Unified Giants.

I'm feeling better main.
I hope so.
A whole lot better.
You better start tweeting.
I'm feeling like I'm on a whole other level main.
You better step your game up.
KEI-SHON-SON… KEI-SHON-SON.
Worldwide.
And still you got to say, you got to say.
Wo wo wo worldwide.
Yeah.

I'm steady hanging with them squares and them nerds.
So disregard every single thing you heard.
They holler run away slave how did you get away?
How did you get away run away slave?
Well me and master clashed.
I grabbed that whip back.
That's how I did that… certified beast mode.
Down many dirt roads.
Where sneakers lose souls.
Never to return just to be thrown away.
And yet and still I bare the cross.
To live to see another day… hey.
That's how I'm feeling now.
I need them bills paid.
To go and get it now.
Yet I've been at it… that's how I'm living now.
And some how the piles of money might elude me.
And having things while being broke.
Just don't sooth me.
So get real and live your life like a movie.

I'm working hard ya'll.
Trynna' stack it up.
Spend that, eat that, pour it up.
Its good money and I'll never ever get enough.
Until we got enough… I'm never giving up.

And yet and still we paying bills.
On bills, on bills, on top of bills.
More bills, on bills on top of bills.
With some other bills, I'm talking big bills.

I keep my eyes wide open.
I'd rather see than be seen while good with everybody.
We got to get along, cannot mess the money up.
A great sense of humor, rarely on that funny stuff.
Moronic oxy, break it down and roll it up.
The key to hard work is really just showing up.
I sound smart but I really don't know enough.
I'm headed to that new world follow us.
Where them blunts are shared and models swallow us.
So why lie when it really is the truth though.
And then I feel it every time I hit the both yo.
I'm sporting old cloths coming with some new flows.
And then I cook that, on a Viking stove.
Pan seared and I'm talking life… life.
While them angels stand right here…
I showing love for the world but I lack fear.

I'm working hard ya'll.
Trynna' stack it up.
Spend that, eat that, pour it up.
Its good money and I'll never ever get enough.
Until we got enough… I'm never giving up.

And yet and still we paying bills.
On bills, on bills, on top of bills.
More bills, on bills on top of bills.
With some other bills, I'm talking big bills.

I'm working hard ya'll.
Trynna' stack it up.
Spend that, eat that, pour it up.
Its good money and I'll never ever get enough.
Until we got enough… I'm never giving up.

And yet and still we paying bills.
On bills, on bills, on top of bills.
More bills, on bills on top of bills.
With some other bills, I'm talking big bills.

Stack it up.
Pour it up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh…
Uh-huh, yeah.
