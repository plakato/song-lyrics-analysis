Lucid Poetry Lyrics
by Unholy Homies.

Rapping off activis niggas this is poetry they know it's me.
Unholy nigga smokin potently.
But focus b.
Feel them vibrations and ya soul will leave.
Supposedly the young boys praise me like rosary.
Got the ladies all stripped down to they hosiery.
Im in her guts dicking down her ovaries.

Dark lord throwing ninja stars wielding sharp swords.
Blowin dank and elude the cops using parkourrrrr.

Stomp her pussy she gon have to peel it off the floooor.
Can't fuck wit me this wicked rhymes galore.
How much false flags can the masses ignore.

Before I could exhale the herb.
Jordan 2s left the curb.
You niggass is absurd.
If you think we ain't living in the matrix for sure.
Terrorist plots they fake that's my word.
An axis of Families they control the world.
Ain't that some shit ?
Don't drag my name in the mud Unless it's actavis.
This is Unholy reek the young activist.
Don't talk shit just pass me shit.
Acid hits herb to the lung get me blasted kid.
Trip the fuck out the visuals I mastered it.
Prison planet full of lies.
My nigga open ya eyes.
Don't just sit here and wait for ya demise.
Rebel against control, And Crack open the sky's.
All my favorites gettin old, We be them new guys.
Favorite color gold , The pallets of my insides.
You ignore ya intuition my nigga I grip mines.
Foolish niggas grip nines.
Send threats.
To shift minds.
Fuck it.
The crime rate high nd so am I.
Im from the darkside something like the sith kind.
Moving wit the force like a fuckin jedeye.
Fuck the FBI.
Fuck bein a patsy you'll never catch me I'm Leonardo decapri.
Ya lies only work on ppl that don't like asking.
Tre-flip my hover board while you in a taxi.
Dabs on the Marley nigga call me young waxy.
Dabs on my marley nigga call me young waxyyy.
...... fuck the government nigga tax me.
