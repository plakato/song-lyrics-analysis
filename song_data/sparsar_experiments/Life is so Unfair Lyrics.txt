Life is so Unfair Lyrics
by 50/50 Twin.

50/50 Twin.
I penetrate eliminate, eat beef like dinner plate.
Disintegrate cakes stem that hate, know I was fin to say.
Roy Jones Jr. imitate, then release what's in the K.
Ride off on a spin a day, plus fo' that's 28's.
Provoke or stimulate, cause Twin is thinner weight.
Kick your face with my Gucci Air Force, I'm pimping snakes.
Run like you in a race, see the effect of the mistakes.
Skin or face get a grip, you sliding on winter skates.
50/50 is pissed off, just leave him alone.
If he come to rob your house, just leave him your home.
Until his brother get out, not for any reason he come.
His gun case got every gun, swords and 53 bombs.
It would be way too late, when bullets sleep in your lungs.
Your heartbeat decreased completely, now your breathing is gone.
Your Pastor sitting by your bedside, reading you psalms.
I told you 50/50 was pissed, now just leave him alone.

I feel like life is so unfair.

50/50 Twin.
Fellas try and fellas die, bullets fly in fellas eye.
Fellas end up in a wheelchair, hollows fly in fellas thigh.
Hello hi tell your guy, don't pedal by metal fly.
You got kids to live for, you better take your tail inside.
Catch my enemy while they sleeping, give 'em pillow shots.
This anger I issue out, reflects I've been through a lot.
Am I on mute, does anybody hear me yelling out.
Very loud I'm way too rough, in this rap game spare me now.
If thug shit is your type of high, then inhale me now.
I have so much tension, I probably could push or pet you down.
Toe to toe in every round, I'm flawless I carry crowns.
I'm the Paul Bearer for the circus, because I buried clowns.
Look don't even jam 50/50, if you gon turn it down.
Think I'm a joke, I'll put a lighter to your lip and burn your smile.
I'll put a lighter to your lip, and burn your smile.
I'll put a lighter to your lip, and burn your smile.

This ain't me writing this rap, I can't control my pen.
The words are coming from, another soul within.
Now I'm punching on myself, like where you go with Twin.
A 'Vard street block, I'm saying things Twin was holding in.
Here you have the red pill, and this is the blue.
Reality or dream world, whichever you choose.
I'm the Neo of this rap game, possessing the juice.
Download the beef stain, see what I'm fixing to do.
My name ain't Santa Clause, but I chill on your roof.
Put a stain on your shirt, like you spilling your juice.
I'm the snake that bit your foot, when you slid in your boots.
Take a murder case to trial, lose appealing and move.
I got a Tech called Mr. T, that don't pity the fool.
I slide down the vent in your room, and get rid of you dude.
Leave your body floating about, in the shivering pool.
I'm too dangerous for myself, see what I'm living will do.
