High Up Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


I come through finessing shit, he mad that I finessed his bitch.
Im smoked out my blunt is lit, Im sipping drink, cup full with gin.
I told the coach to put me in, cause I hate losing, I just win.
So where should I begin, I drop the top, dreads in the wind.
Im cruising on your block, came for the guap and your girlfriend.
And nigga it won't stop, Im on the top ain't gotta have no friends.
And you will just get shot with sniper rifles I got hit men.
And Im just getting hot, I burn a nigga like a suntan.
The whole world against me, Im a army but Im one man.
So if you ever touch me, razor blades Imma cut your hand.
I gotta sit em down, cause I swear these dudes don't understand.
I keep a four pound, I lay him down now he hella dead.
I bust ya head, a pilgrim couldn't touch my bread.
Fuck the feds, I told my trap niggas break a leg, good luck.
Fuck it still whip it cook it up.
Its funny how they wanna eat but they ain't cook with us.
Now look at us, I heard you biting dust.
Before I ever walk, man Im gon' catch the bus.
Before I ever catch the bus yo bitch gon' pick me up.
Before I drop yo bitch off, I bet she lick me up.
Im rolling sticky stuff, while niggas plotting, tryna hit me up.
Cause they can't sit with us, we counting up, Im getting paper cuts.
Got RÃ©my out the bottle, regular niggas get the plastic cups.
Why you acting tough, your chest out nigga you ain't buff.
I bring the vest out, and tecs out and nigga you get touched.
So send that text out and tell yo niggas that they better rush.
I let yo girl know, that I'm finna murk her man crush.
So nigga keep it real or you will get yo head bust.
