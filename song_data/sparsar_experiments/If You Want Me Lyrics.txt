If You Want Me Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Are you really here, or am I dreamin'?
I can't tell dreams from truth.
For it's been so long since I have seen you.
I can hardly remember your face anymore.

When I get really lonely.
And the distance causes only silence.
I think of you smiling.
With pride in your eyes.
A lover that sighs.

If you want me.
Satisfy me.
If you want me.
Satisfy me.

Are you really sure that you'd believe me?
When others say I lie.
I wonder if you could ever despise me.
When you know I really try.
To be a better one to satisfy you.
For you're everything to me.
And I'll do what you ask me.
If you'll let me be free.

If you want me.
Satisfy me.
If you want me.
Satisfy me.

If you want me.
Satisfy me.
If you want me.
Satisfy me.
