Familiar Patterns Lyrics
by Pup.

This business ain't for the faint of heart
I fell for the bullshit
Then. I started falling apart
And by the end of the summer
I let'em get the best of me
What, a god, damn bummer
What a waste of my energy

So. I spent a long time down in the basement
Instead of rolling with the riff-raff
Cause. I know better. I know better than that
Yeah. I spent a lifetime trying to make it
And when I finally faced the facts
I never felt so. Shitty before
I never felt so miserable

Following familiar patterns
I'm falling back into ruin
I'm, getting serious douche chills
Just being in this room
I couldn't even see the humour
With the situation. I was in
Knocking back, jell-o shooters
Till, I puked in the kitchen

So. I spent a long time down in the basement
Instead of rolling with the riff-raff
Cause. I know better. I know better than that
Yeah. I spent a lifetime trying to make it
And when I finally faced the facts
I never felt so. Shitty before
I never felt so miserable

They used to all talk down to me
Now they're biting their tongues
Used to say: Don't quit your day, job
Well guess what I never had. One

I never felt so shitty before
I never felt so. Miserable

I spent a long time down in the basement
Instead of rolling with the riff-raff
Cause. I am no better, I'm no better than that
Yeah. I spent a long time trying to make it
Well I've. Finally, faced the facts
I never felt so shitty before
I never felt so miserable
