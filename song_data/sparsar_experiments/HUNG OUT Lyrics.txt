HUNG OUT Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.


Kickin down the do.
No smokin fuck it.
I'm blowin O's.
Now suck it ho gimme mo.
Stacks, fore i flip out.
An attack.
Whoever got the sass.
To come at pat.
Look at that, that's me.
Load up.
The three fiddy seventy.
Reverend make the sign of god.
Insteada lettin me.
In.
Ta heaven.
All us 1-8-7's.
Ain't missin out, big told me.
That's faggot steppin.
Brother bredren.
Feel the presence.
Of death.
And disease no easy pease.
Misfortune.
Lemonies snickets.
Still out sleepin wit the crickets.
In the underpass.
Sleepin bag campfire.
The whole department on my ass.
Laugh.
Spark it.
Fuck the car.
Didn't even park it.
Blowin up once they start it.
Already the target market.
Motherfucker tryd to start shit.
Now he's a carcass in the schukyll.
R-I-P MARCUS.

Hang me out to dry.
You wrang me out too many times.
Hang me out to dry.
I'm pearly like the whites of ya eyes.

Lay em deep.
All black.
I'm creepin.
All silent.
Even though the joints quiet.
Saint mary jay and joe simon.
Managed to sneak the nine in.
Know they ain't gonna find it.
Till they cryin.
Layin on the floor dyin.
Go ahead kid you can try it.
Just know i'm out when i'm all outta violence.
Try an stop this.
Rage.
Peep the obituary page.
Higher body count than my age.
Crazy eights.
Couselling aids fuck em.
I'm my own doc.
With my own Glock.
And a bad bitch on my cock.
Stop.
This madness.
Fore i stand up and do some bad ish.
Hung out to dry.
But not to die.
That's why.
I'm still commin.
Fuck the guitar man i'm beat drummin.
Deep in hunneds.
And green.
Still the only one on my fuckin team.
Now you wanna know me?
See?
Everyone wants the cream.
But i ain't have it.
Only a smokey barrel mavrick.
And a couple dead black pricks.
Only stoppin when the track kicks.
Go ahead gimme the bread bitch.
Leavin you for dead in the ditch.

Never gettin hitched.

The jawn still ain't switched.
