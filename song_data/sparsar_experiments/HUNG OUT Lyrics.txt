HUNG OUT Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.


Kickin down the do 
No smokin fuck it 
I'm blowin, O's, 
Now, suck it ho gim me mo 
Stacks fore. I flip out 
An attack 
Whoever got the sass 
To come at pat 
Look at that. That'S me: 
Load up 
The three fiddy. Seventy 
Reverend make the sign of god: 
Insteada lettin me 
In 
Ta, heaven 
All us 1-8-7's 
Ain't missin out big, told me: 
That's faggot, steppin, 
Brother, bredren 
Feel, the presence, 
Of death, 
And disease, no easy pease, 
Misfortune, 
Lemonies, snickets 
Still out sleepin wit, the crickets 
In, the underpass 
Sleepin bag, campfire 
The whole department on my ass 
Laugh 
Spark, it 
Fuck the car 
Didn't even park it 
Blowin up once they start it. 
Already the target market 
Motherfucker tryd to start shit, 
Now he's a carcass in the schukyll 
R-I-P MARCUS 
 
Hang me out to dry 
You wrang me out too many times. 
Hang me out to dry 
I'm pearly, like the whites of ya eyes, 
 
Lay, em, deep 
All, black 
I'm creepin 
All, silent 
Even, though the joints quiet, 
Saint, mary jay and joe simon 
Managed, to sneak the nine in 
Know. They ain't gon na find it 
Till. They cryin 
Layin on the floor. Dyin 
Go ahead kid you can try, it 
Just know i'm out when i'm all outta violence, 
Try an stop. This 
Rage 
Peep, the obituary page 
Higher body count than my age: 
Crazy, eights, 
Couselling, aids, fuck, em, 
I'm, my own doc 
With. My own Glock 
And, a bad bitch on my cock, 
Stop 
This madness 
Fore. I stand up and do some bad ish 
Hung out to dry 
But, not to die 
That's. Why 
I'm still commin 
Fuck the guitar man? I'M beat drummin 
Deep in hunneds, 
And green 
Still. The only one on my fuckin team 
Now, you wan na know me 
See 
Everyone wants the cream 
But. I ain't. Have it 
Only a smokey barrel, mavrick 
And a couple dead: black pricks, 
Only stoppin when the track kicks 
Go ahead. Gim me: the bread, bitch 
Leavin you for dead in the ditch 
 
Never gettin, hitched, 
, 
The, jawn, still, ain't switched
,
