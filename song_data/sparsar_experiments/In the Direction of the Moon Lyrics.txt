In the Direction of the Moon Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

I.
Am a wall of sand and stone.
And you.
You're some kind of ivy.
I'm trying to hold.
As best as I can.
As best as I can.

But I'm a disaster.
I could not be burning faster.
I stick my arms into webs.
I take my meals with weirdos.
And play with my rocket ships.
And all the while you.

You.
Are so composed.
So composed.
So composed.
You are the most gracious thing I know.
Touched by licking fires.
Touched by snow.

And I.
I think your fantastic.
And I.
I know that you care.
I'll put my rockets away.
If you.
Are a house of skin and air.

I've been running off of fumes again.
I've been running off my mouth.
I've been running in the hours.
Between midnight and dawn.
In the direction of the moon.
With the impression that's the way.
The way to find your house.

So hey.
I will build your bastion.
And hey.
How long.
Can you put up with these questions?
When you've got.
Nowhere to go.
Except into the terrible air.

And I.
I think you're fantastic.
And I.
I know that you care.
I'll put my rockets away.
If you.
Are a house of skin and.

Erring on the side of caution.
Apparently has.
Come down from the rim of that crystal glass.
Cause I.
I'm a wall of sand and stone.
And you.
You're some kind of ivy.
I'm trying to hold.
As best as I can.
