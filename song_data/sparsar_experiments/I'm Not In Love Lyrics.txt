I'm Not In Love Lyrics
by Yung Joey.


See, I could tell you something that you already know.
I don't, well, shit, we don't love these hoes.
Fuck 'em pass 'em, fuck 'em pass 'em.
That's my homies, yeah we fuck 'em, pass 'em, fuck 'em pass 'em, yeah.
Bitch that's the word around town, and bitch this is dog eat dog world.

Bitch your booty look fat, let a nigga hit it from the back.
I say aye girl what the fuck is your name, cause I ain't really trying to play.
games.
Can ? when you can't?
Yeah, right up out the front.
Bout to blaze a blunt, get up in the car.
See what she want, hopefully the front.
Let her come through, dive into lust.
Still no love, in god we trust.
Hand on the rug, hand in the truck.
Hand is a must, send her to the bus.
Yeah it's fucked up, but my heart she never touched.
Yeah it's fucked up, but on the real the brain sucked.

I'm not in love, so don't forget it.
It's just a silly phase, I'm going through.
And just because, I call you up.
Don't get me wrong, don't think you got it made.
I'm not in love.
No, no.

Nothing but sex is on my mind, what's your name girl you so fine.
Wanna take you to the W, but I don't really want no wine and dine.
I'mma keep this shit always G, ? like a MP3.
What I look like? Pay you for the pussy.
What I'm giving you is still free.
No money for calamari, I'm so sorry dolly.
I can't lie, you got game like Amari but play me like Atari.
I got big dreams and ambition, you can call me Wale.
If you think that I'mma kiss your lotus flower bomb, uh uh that's Wale.
How the fuck I'mma fall in love with you, when I'm in love with myself.
Bitch you think I'm cuffing you bugging, wait let me get you some help.
Make sure my presence is felt, ? down in my undergarments.
