Stop Lying to Us Lyrics
by Swordplay.

Stop lying to us.
We are no fools.
We had recognized Superman before he had removed his glasses.
Do you really think we can swallow anything?
This drunk bearded guy with Nike trainers is definitely not Santa Clause.
The truth started propagating.
We all know that Tony Michelli is a fake housekeeper.
Do you really think we can swallow anything?
In real life Tony Danza's boxers are lying about on the floor.

Please excuse the maniacal laugh.
My man just said the Earth's not flat.
A rat-a-tat-tat.
Hit the crash like a dummy on the wheel.
I bleed so funny I feel it's unreal.
Is this really happening or is it a daydream with a bit of pitter-patter.
perhaps?
I'm hanging in a half suspension.
The tension of a thread tied to balloons to relax.
I've been running for years.
I've been crawling for longer.
Think I got enough fuel to burn a few more days.
Running out of helium gas.
It's no laughing matter when your matter goes gray.
There won't be sunshine every day.
It's just the only way I'll ever feel safe.
Oh well, well I'll never safe OK.
I don't want to startle any carbon-based forms in the place with the facts of.
our fabrication.
Statistics are made up or sad or suffer bad habits of manipulation.
I'm made up from duct tape a little silly putty.
I got battery acid and a bolt in the brain…

Stop lying to us.
We are no fools.
We all know that Ronald McDonald is a fucking fake clown.
Do you really think we can swallow anything?
A guy eating burgers everyday would be twice as big as this man.
The truth started propagating.
No one will ever trust a white guy with a red afro haircut.
Do you really think we can swallow anything?
Ronald McFreakyDonald I'm not scared of you anymore.

You best believe that the best emcee in the world's had to force feed an ego.
A San Pellegrino or a cappuccino in her last favorite casino.
As for me, always been a fan of risk.
I really really can't resist it.
If there's something to the prophecy of Nostradamus then I missed it.
I insist that this apocalyptic event you think is about to happen.
Is only gonna happen if you let it happen so don't let it happen don't let it.
happen.
Tell me can you count past two? I can count past seven.
My calendar continues past the weekend.
Nevertheless I've elected Monday my favorite day to sleep in cause I am that.
A.M.
Crackle and hum transistor in the back of the lung.
My antenna broke off in momentous pain.
At the same moment that it landed it stung.
And I'm trapped in the seat between the bus driver and the bums babbling…

Stop lying to us.
We are no fools.
We all know that Mitch from Baywatch is a fake swimming instructor.
Do you really think we can swallow anything?
In real life he's not successful with women under sixty.
The truth started propagating.
Mitch stop holding your breath.
Let you belly live for the day.
Do you really think we can swallow anything?
Accept accept accept accept being old is not a shame.

I got a test tube and I got a shot glass.
Now which one do you want to put the world in?

I got the perfect version of the true story and the worst environment that I.
could ever tell it in.
They got six packs of Bibles at 7-11.
I like the packaging that they sell em in.
I'm gambling on being gullible as I am dreamless in a deep sleep.
Listen to the beep beep beep beep beep beep beep of your alarm clock.
Well I've been building a super computer from the common household object I've.
found.
Down in a bomb shelter with investors that didn't ever want to be underground.
Put us in a Western, put us in a Wal-Mart.
I'll try to be a better consumer.
It's always been up for grabs now but I'm the market for a better future.

Stop lying to us.
We are no fools.
We all know that Ronald McDonald is a fucking fake clown.
Do you really think we can swallow anything?
A guy eating burgers everyday would be twice as big as this man.
The truth started propagating.
No one will ever trust a white guy with a red afro haircut.
Do you really think we can swallow anything?
Ronald McFreakyDonald I'm not scared of you anymore.
