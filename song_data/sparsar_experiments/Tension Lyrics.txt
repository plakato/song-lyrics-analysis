Tension Lyrics
by VK.

I prefer the lights out, even though its just for you.
And now theres nothing I can hide from you.
But I'll do it for you.

Its so wrong together.
Its so wrong forever.
Its so wrong together.
Its so wrong.

In my dreams for so long.
I can barely contain this flash of lightning.
And I know I was blinded.
It had barely begun.
And already over.

Its so wrong together.
Its so wrong forever.
Its so wrong together.
Its so wrong.

Its so wrong together.
Its so wrong forever.
Its so wrong together.
Its so wrong.
