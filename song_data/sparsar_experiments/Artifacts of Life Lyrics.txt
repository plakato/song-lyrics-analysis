Artifacts of Life Lyrics
by Rufus Blaq.


Is you doing the sticking or is you getting stuck.
Is you doing the fucking, or is you getting fucked.
And that's REAL.

It ain't a game no more its a sport.
If you ain't got heart to play then stay off da court 3x.

It's the life shit, raised in a crisis.
Love is priceless, respect tightness.
React on the night shift.
If it wasn't for the flow, I'd probably have to double back.
Bubble crack, see my niggas floating in the bubble ac.

That's logical, psychological, diabolical.
Leave you in the hospital, remarkable.
When you write the Butta they be mocking you.
Clocking you, rocking jewels they think of poppin you.
Think of poppin them, ask young bloods and pop and them.
I be watching them, rocking them.
With the Butta bars, it's the LOx and them.

We touch judges and tease DA's to be beat cases.
And squash beef with erasers, change paces.
Back and forth for bad urine, it's getting boring.
It's especially when I'm blowing before court in the morning.
The Jew lawyer, the true employeer.
That will destroy ya defense like the Hoyas.
Linen suit with a mean goya.
Who stand by my side while the bailiff screams out Court in Order.

Nigga, move your feet, lose your seat.
We in it for the cream of wheat and everybody's gotta eat.
You on chow line, we got the last piece of meat.
Getting bailed about twelve, right back up on the street.
Crushed rocks on my neck, plush under my feet.
I be on some life shit, til God put me to sleep.

Huh, we on some life shit.
Niggas on the right shift.
My whole camp keep it tightness with vice grips.
And I ain't going out God with the light switch.
Cause when I'm gone I ain't going out like this.

Who me? I never wanted to be a doctor or an architech.
Fuck a lawyer, since 8 I wanted to be a drug connect.
With fast dough, for teen, I push the palm green Milano.
Rocking top designos, hitting chicks but never loving.
A Willie, what made me.
like this?
I feel in love with cuban icesis.
Taking my pops advice, stacking dough from doing heists.
Flossing bubbles, my shorty, she keep the Marquis.
At the Garden drinking beer next to Spike Lee.
My staff holding, we out here trying to lock it.
No doubt I keep a grave yard in my fatigue pocket.
Of dead presidencies, my.
street game is thorough.
Ask the Willies in the borough, LOX getting that Deniro.
For real.

I know how it is, every sec you gotta show up to court.
Robbing every spot you see to make child support.
Eating every meal slow, cherishing every bite.
Putting pelish on your Nikes cause your shit ain't tight.
We be running scams just to see your mobs in some minks.
We don't care what society thinks.
And I ain't trying to do time cause prison ain't good for my health.
But if I got 25, fuck hanging myself.
Nuff respect to the niggas making money however.
Cause it's hard trying to live without the mozzeralla.
Cheddar, cheese, that's what that bes.
Certain things you need, necessities to slang kis.
Accumulate a hundred Gs, keep your eyes on your stash.
Cause you could miss something important from watching ass.
And you ain't hitting to it, never front like you hard.
Niggas will strip that ass naked, have you fucking a dog.
Is you doing the sticking or is you getting stuck.
Is you doing the fucking, or is you getting fucked.
And that's REAL.

It ain't a game no more its a sport.
If you ain't got heart to play then stay off da court 4x.

Stay off the court, stop balling, retire nigga.
