Sunset
by Swimming With Dolphins.

You never heard me knocking on the door.
I found you balled up on your bathroom floor.
You told me everything in your defense.
And never understood the consequence.
I won't console, when you have control.
Every time's the last time, but I know you'll go and do it again.
Yeah, you'll do it again.

There was a halo resting above your head then it slid down.
Around your neck and I bet you thought I'd never find out cause.
You think you're so clever.

Again and again and again.
You'll do it again and again and again.

So, now we're all grown up and settled down.
And you're the only one thats livin' in this ghost town.
Try to keep in touch; at least pretend.
I know we'll always be fair-weather friends, 'til the end.

If there's a cause, it's already lost.
Cause I tried the last time and you tossed me aside again.
But it won't happen again.
