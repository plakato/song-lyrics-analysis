Bomb Drop Lyrics
by The Virus.

Life will be different when the doomsday is here.
The button is pushed and the missiles are near.
Innocence suddenly replaced with fear.
So soon it won't matter about church or career.
Cause all that we be left are the roaches and dust.
This is the thanks for misplacing your trust.

No one survives at the bomb drop.
We're heading for global destruction.
No one survives at the bomb drop.
Because of the world's corporation.

The children you love will soon disappear.
Some way to grow up living in fear.
Things getting worse day by f**king day.
Nothing is left but to be blown away.
Starving for food you will eat your own hand.
Thank all the leader you put in command.

No one survives at the bomb drop.
We're heading for global destruction.
No one survives at the bomb drop.
Because of the world's corporation.

Rubble and debris, once a city stood here.
I saw it coming for all these years.
We choose to ignore it and focus on sh*t.
Well the greatest crime of all has just been commit.
Now there's nothing left that you can do.
Blown apart to bits will be you.
Say goodbye to family that's all I can say.
Kiss your ass goodbye it's you last f**king day.

No one survives at the bomb drop.
We're heading for global destruction.
No one survives at the bomb drop.
Because of the world's corruption.
