After This Lyrics
by 3LW.

Mmmmm mmm mmm mm mmm.
Oooohh.

Kiely:.
I was just about to walk away.
When I felt your gravity.
Pulling me closer.
There was no breakin' free.
It had a hold on me.
So what was I suppossed to do.
When it's getting so hot.
Was it your or the lemon drop.
Like a shot straight to my head.
Think I better catch my breath.

I can't let you get away.
So I'll just make a move.
Step to you and then say.

What you doin' after this?
Got me thinkin' bout doin' them thangs I ain't never did.
And I might wanna roll with you.
But before we hit the lot.
Tell me what you wanna do.

Adrienne:.
Thinkin' you know the deal.
So baby come and grab the wheel.
What you gon say now.
Tell me are you down tonight.
Cuz I'm in for the long ride.
Cuz you're a hot boy.
And even if the clock strikes one, two.
Ain't no way we gon move cuz.
I came to get my party on.
Wasn't lookin' but I think that you're the one.

I can't let you get away.
So I'll just make a move.
Step to you and then say.

What you doin' after this?
Got me thinkin' bout doin' them thangs I ain't never did.
And I might wanna roll with you.
But before we hit the lot.
Tell me what you wanna do.

What you doin' after this?
Got me thinkin' bout doin' them thangs I ain't never did.
And I might wanna roll with you.
But before we hit the lot.
Tell me what you wanna do.

Say I don't care, where we go.
As long as I'm with you around.
Even in a crowd, we're all alone.
Cuz all I'm thinkin' about is You.

What you doin' after this?
Got me thinkin' bout doin' them thangs I ain't never did.
And I might wanna roll with you.
But before we hit the lot.
Tell me what you wanna do.

What you doin' after this?
Got me thinkin' bout doin' them thangs I ain't never did.
And I might wanna roll with you.
But before we hit the lot.
Tell me what you wanna do.

Oooh ohh ohh oh.
Tell me what you wanna do.
Oooh ohh ohh oh.
Ohh tell me what you wanna do oohh laugh.

Ooooh ooh ohh oooh.
Ohh yeaaah.
Wanna know what you wanna do oooh.

What you doin after this?

Got me doin' things I ain't never did.

Ooooh.
