Kalopsia Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.

I never lie.
To myself.
Tonight.

Rose tinted eyes.
Colour my sorrow.
A shade of wine.

Bye bye black balloon.
See you real soon.
Wave bye bye.

Oh why you so sad.
What have they done?
Forget those mindless baboons.
They're off playing god.

Copy cats in cheap suits.
Are playing it safe.
While cannibals of bad news.
Consume a parade.

Is it wonderful?

Far, far from shore.
Land of nightmares.
Gone forever more.

I love you more.
Than I can control.
I don't even try.
Why would I?

Oh why the long face?
You've got it all wrong.
Forget the rat in the race.
We'll choke chain them all.

Fates favour the ones.
Who help themselves.
The rest feel the sting of the lash.
As they row....
The boat to hell.
