Caught Up Lyrics
by Vivian Green.

Caught up in life.
Caught in a mess.
Caught up in time.
Caught up in less than.

Caught up in the things.
You only want me to do.
Caught up in not doing.
Things that I like to.

I'm caught up in this house.
I need to get out.
Caught up suffocating deadly.
No wonder how.

Caught up.
In a situation that's nothing but stressful.
Caught up thinking this time.
I was being careful.

How do we get ourselves.
So caught up?
Cause when we look back it was.
Never enough.

To put up with the foolishness.
Never worth much.
Crazy situations just.
Wreck Heaven.

Never what you thought it was.
When you were so caught up.
Never what you thought it was.
When you were so caught up.

Caught up in my head.
Caught up in lies.
Caught up in telling myself.
He's still a good guy.

Caught up in the way.
The way things looked.
Caught up in the holidays.
When we were good, yeah.

Caught up.
In my issues.
Caught up.
Tryna really love this dude.
Caught up in love.
When I was the only one loving.

Caught up telling myself.
Everything's okay.
Caught up in this selfishness.
Like every single day.

How do we get ourselves.
So caught up?
Cause when we look back it was.
Never enough.

To put up with the foolishness.
Never worth much.
Crazy situations.
Wreck Heaven.

Never what you thought it was.
When you were so caught up.
Never what you thought it was.
When you were so caught up.

Caught up.
I'm already used to him.
Caught up.
Who wants to start again?
Caught up.
Accepting in the end.
Caught up.
Maybe I'll get a ring.

Caught up.
Cause he pacified me.
With the things he said.
Caught up.
Being left up, oh.
When he slept in my bed.

How do we get ourselves.
So caught up?
Cause when we look back it was.
Never enough.

To put up with the foolishness.
Never worth much.
Crazy situations just.
Wreck Heaven.

How do we get ourselves.
So caught up?
Cause when we look back it was.
Never enough.

To put up with the foolishness.
Never worth much.
Crazy situations just.
Wreck Heaven.

Never what you thought it was.
When you were so caught up.
Never what you thought it was.
When you were so caught up.
