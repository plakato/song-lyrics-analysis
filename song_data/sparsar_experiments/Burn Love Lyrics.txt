Burn Love Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

When I`m alone I think about this.
All of my friends and brothers I miss.
I miss the days and the open hearts.
Oh am I asking for too much.
Broken and bruised no hope in eyes.
When those you loved left far behind.
The wind blows.
The earth shakes.
High water kills.
The pyre burns.

Burn, burn my love.
Love is all we got.
Burn bring us back to life again.

Burn, burn my love.
Love is all we got.
Burn bring us back to life again.

One day my world went.
Went mad.
That day my world went.
Went black.
I saw the nations.
Nations dying.
Men, children, women.
Mothers crying.

Begging for mercy.

Burn my love.

When I`m alone I think about this.
All of my friends and brothers I miss.
I miss the days and the open hearts.
Oh am I asking for too much.

Burn, burn my love.
Love is all we got.
Burn bring us back to life again.

When I'm alone I think about you...
