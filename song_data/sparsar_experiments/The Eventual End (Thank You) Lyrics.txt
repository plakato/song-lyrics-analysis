The Eventual End (Thank You) Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

They had a modest plan to write a song or two.
And play together a couple of times for a few.
They never dreamed about what followed.
As they won second place in 1998.
Let's sing this song together.
And reunite once more.
Let's sing this song together.
And reunite once more.
For the last, for the last.
For the last show on earth.
For the last, for the last.
For the last show on earth.
As the years progressed the songs stacked up.
Electron John, I hope we can dance today.
And from time to time, they travelled the world.
They were thankful they were blessed.
Thank you, thank you.
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake.
Let's sing this song together.
And reunite once more.
Let's sing this song together.
And reunite once more.
For the last, for the last.
For the last show on earth.
For the last, for the last.
For the last show on earth.
Let's sing this song together.
And reunite once more.
Let's sing this song together.
And reunite once more.
For the last, for the last.
For the last show on earth.
For the last, for the last.
For the last show on earth.
