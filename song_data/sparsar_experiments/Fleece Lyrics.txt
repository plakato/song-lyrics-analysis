Fleece Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


Yeah. Three. TA3, yeah. HT-HTA,.
haha.

Fleece on fleek, she on fleek, yeah.
She on me, what y'all think, yeah.
ATL in my speech, LA streets.
Shit is epic, no L.A. Reed.

It's getting hectic, niggas want to compete, they getting reckless.
All the energy directed at me has been pretty negative.
I'm checked up no matter where I'm in.
Even when I had to purchase from the clearance rack.
Just kicking fat, first {?} fleece, no more jeans, yeah.
Chris Nolan the {?} when he on scene, yeah.
Flow on, interstellar, I'm with whatever.
You getting jealous, I'm getting better, I'm lit as ever.

Check fleece on fleek, she on fleek, yeah.
ATL in my speech, LA streets, yeah.
Salva back on my beat, back on my-wait, uh, wait.

Oh, we're talking rap and stuff.
I hit the track and bring it back to the Saint Valentines Day Massacre.
Damn, trigger finger on fleek, I'm gonna squeeze it.
A situation with me, you don't need, yeah.
Tell fill in the blank to drop a bomb on it.
Which ever DJ's name, you all should be on it.
I ball yearly on it, like Paul Pierce or something.
Instead of dissing someone, go out and get you something.
When keeping it real goes wrong, that's what some of y'all careers been on.
Damn homie, a few month ago you was the man homie.
The fuck happened to you?, aw man.

Check fleece on fleek, she on fleek, yeah.
She on me, what y'all think, yeah.
ATL in my speech, LA streets, yeah.
Salva on the beat, HTA3, yeah.
Haha, yeah!
