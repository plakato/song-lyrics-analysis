Fleece Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


Yeah. Three. TA3 yeah. HT-HTA, 
haha, 
 
Fleece on fleek. She on fleek, yeah 
She on me. What y'all think yeah 
ATL in my speech LA streets 
Shit is epic, no L.A., Reed, 
 
It's getting hectic niggas want to compete. They getting reckless 
All, the energy directed at me has been pretty negative. 
I'M checked up no matter where I'm in 
Even, when I had to purchase from the clearance rack, 
Just kicking fat first {, } fleece, no more jeans, yeah 
Chris Nolan, the { } when he on scene, yeah, 
Flow on interstellar, I'm with whatever 
You getting jealous. I'M getting better, I'm lit as ever: 
 
Check fleece on fleek she on fleek yeah 
ATL. In my speech, LA streets, yeah 
Salva back on my beat back on my-wait uh, wait: 
 
Oh, we're talking rap and stuff 
I hit the track and bring it back to the Saint Valentines Day. Massacre 
Damn trigger finger on fleek, I'm gon na squeeze it 
A situation with me. You don't need yeah 
Tell fill in the blank to drop a bomb on it, 
Which ever DJ's name, you all should be on it. 
I ball yearly on it like Paul Pierce or something 
Instead of dissing. Someone go out and get you something 
When keeping it real goes wrong. That'S what some of y'all careers been on 
Damn homie. A few month ago you was the man homie 
The fuck happened to you, aw man, 
 
Check fleece, on fleek. She on fleek, yeah 
She on me. What y'all think yeah 
ATL in my speech LA streets, yeah 
Salva on the beat HTA3 yeah 
Haha yeah ?
