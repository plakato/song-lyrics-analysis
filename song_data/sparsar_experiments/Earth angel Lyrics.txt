Earth angel Lyrics
by Swiss (DE).

Earth angel.
Earth angel.
Will you be mine.
My darling dear.
Love you all the time.
I'm just a fool.
A fool in love, with you.

Earth Angel.
Earth angel.
The one I adore.
Love you forever.
And ever more.
I'm just a fool.
A fool in-love with you.

I fell for you.
And I knew.
The vision of your love's loveliness.
I hope and I pray.
That someday.
I'll be the vision of your.
Hap-happiness.

Earth angel.
Earth angel.
Please be mine.
My darling dear.
Love you all the time.
I'm just a fool.
A fool in love, with you.

I fell for you.
And I knew.
The vision of your love's loveliness.
I hope and I pray.
That someday.
I'll be the vision.
The vision of your happiness.

Earth angel.
Earth angel.
Please be mine.
My darling dear.
Love you all the time.
I'm just a fool.
A fool in love, with you.
