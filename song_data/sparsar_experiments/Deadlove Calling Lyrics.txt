Deadlove Calling Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Lost souls seek for a way.
....
One half chosen to stay.
....
Time can't seem to erase.
....
Just a million faces....

It's all about you - It's all about me.
It's all about oneness - Eternally.
...Deadlove calling me.
....

Living life as a lie.
....
Visions through blinded eyes.
....
Yesterday was alive -I'm alive-.
....
The only face I wanna' see......

Don't you hear me calling you!? -Deadlove-.
Don't you hear me calling you!? -Deadlove-.
....

I can't leave me* - I can't leave you*.
I can't leave this* - Alone.

...-Deadlove calling me-.

-This voice said, Don't let them break you-.
-And I remembered thinking...-.
-It's too late, I'm already broken-.
