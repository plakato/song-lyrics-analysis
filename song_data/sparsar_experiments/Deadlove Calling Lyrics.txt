Deadlove Calling Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Lost souls seek for a way 
 ... 
One half chosen to stay 
, ... 
Time can't seem to erase 
 ... 
Just a million faces ... 
 
It's. All about you. It'S all about me, 
It's all about oneness, Eternally 
, ... Deadlove, calling me 
 ... 
 
Living life as a lie: 
 ... 
Visions through blinded eyes, 
 ... 
Yesterday was alive. -I'M alive-, 
, ... 
The only face I wan na' see ... .. 
 
Don't. You hear me calling you -Deadlove- 
Don't, you hear me calling you -Deadlove- 
 ..., 
 
I can't leave me*. I can't leave you* 
I can't leave this* Alone. 
 
 ... -Deadlove calling me- 
 
-This voice said, Don't let them break you- 
-And. I remembered thinking ... 
-It's too late, I'm already broken-
