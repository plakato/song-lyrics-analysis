No Closer To Heaven Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

I'm digging up the bones of the failures I've buried.
I'm pulling out my white flags in varying stages.
Of sun bleached in gray.
Gonna sew them all together.
Gonna fashion their bones into a frame.
Tie the flags on a string.
Stretched across until they're wings.
I'm no closer to heaven.

I clipped a bird with my car on the freeway.
He won't see a burial.
And all week long I kept thinking of death.
How me and Hemingway share forehead scars.
I won't meet the same fate that he did.
In a world that I can't fix.
With a hammer in my grip.
I'm no closer to heaven.

It feels like the day before something important.
It feels like the first snow of the season that sticks.
It's how I'll always feel like a failure.
In the back of my head.
No matter where I've been.
The future feels bright.
The glow of the city.
Out across the great plains.
With the closer I get.
The further I feel away.
I can stay here in the darkness.
Feels like I'm wandering in circles for days.
I may never reach the gates.
I'll keep walking anyway.
I'm no closer to heaven.
