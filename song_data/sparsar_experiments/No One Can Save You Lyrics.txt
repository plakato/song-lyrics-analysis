No One Can Save You Lyrics
by The Virus.

You never seem to see the light of day.
With open eyes you had to have your way.

You don't know what to do.
No one can save you.
You don't know what to do.
No one can save you.

No one can save you.

Where have those selfish choices got you now?
Your life just fell apart it's all around you.

You don't know What to do.
No one can save you.
You don't know what to do.
No one can save you.

No one can save you.

No it's up to you now.

You don't know What to do.
No one can save you.
You don't know what to do.
No one can save you.

No one can save you.
