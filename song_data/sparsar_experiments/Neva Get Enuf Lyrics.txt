Neva Get Enuf Lyrics
by 3LW.

3L and Wayne, what up.

Listen, I'm way better than that chump.
Sorry cause I let her get her stuff.
Cause she shiftin' with a brother who could never get enough of her.
I'd go tough for her, could never do enough for her.
Mad love for her, mad thoughts of her.
Days and days again.
And I'm like Rocky, where's my Adrian.
Now holler back.
Sweethearts bounce if you feel me.
Little women love, little me never get enough.

Why every time I meet a guy who wants to try.
To get my mathematics I deny.
He wants to take me home, he's out of his mind.
Will I ever meet someone for me.

He's gotta be the one.
That I'm daydreaming to spend my time with.
He's gotta be the one.
With no chicks attached and that's my man.

To all my girls that dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
The ones that makes us cling to the thoughts of love.
He's so fresh, he's so clean, yes, I call and he calls me too.
That's why he's bad, my place, his pad, I could never get enough.

I, I'm so glad I came across this kind of guy.
He didn't ask me for my number, I thought why.
Then when I got the chance and now he's gentle inside.
Now he's the one that's got me open wide.

He's gotta be the one.
That I'm daydreaming to spend my time with.
He's gotta be the one.
With no chicks attached and that's my man.

To all my girls that dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
The ones that makes us cling to the thoughts of love.
He's so fresh, he's so clean, yes, I call and he calls me too.
That's why he's bad, my place, his pad, I could never get enough.

Mom, I stop to holler, not to bother.
If you busy I'll wait out for hours.
I'mma stick my wait out all the way out for hours.
What you know 'bout bein' hot for hours and not from showers, shh....
Not yet though, how 'bout some flowers.
How 'bout we hop the wild one, knock out some lobster.
I could make your problems easy , stop jabbin' and slabbin'.
Weezy never get enough.

To all my girls that dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
The ones that makes us cling to the thoughts of love.
He's so fresh, he's so clean, yes, I call and he calls me too.
That's why he's bad, my place, his pad, I could never get enough.

To all my girls that dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
The ones that makes us cling to the thoughts of love.
He's so fresh, he's so clean, when I call him he calls me too.
That's why he's bad, my place, his pad, I could never get enough.
