Christmas Ain't Christmas (Without the One You Love) Lyrics
by SWV.

Christmas just ain't christmas.
Without the one you love.
New Years just ain't new years.
With the one you love.

Underneath the missletoe.
I saw his face all aglow.
Last year this time.
Now I stand all alone.
And my house is not a home.
Without that man of mine.

Christmas just ain't christmas.
Without the one you love.
New Years just ain't new years.
With the one you love.

Twelve O' clock and all is well.
And I was doing O' so swell.
Last year this time.
Going shopping for presents together.
Making vows to leave each other-never.
It was a waiste of time.

Christmas just ain't christmas.
Without the one you love.
New Years just ain't new years.
With the one you love.

Oh, and now I stand all alone.
And my house is not home.
Without that man of mine, OOOOH.

Christmas just ain't christmas.
Without the one you love.
New Years just ain't new years.
With the one you love.
