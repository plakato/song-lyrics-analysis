Get Mine Lyrics
by Yung Redd.


Yeah, I'ma get mine.
You know, that I'ma get mine.
You know, that I'ma get mine.
You know, that I'ma get mine.

Now get your's partna, I'ma get mine.
It was a long time coming, no mistakes this time.
And I know, you can't name one nigga like me.
Loved by many, no respect for the police.

Yung Redd.
Naw this ain't pretend, I'm back at it again.
Tell your friends to change, I got money to spend.
Ay my grandaddy, grandaddy was a hustler.
So this year, it's grand hustle.
You mo'fuckers understand struggle, move on the block with the same shuffle.
Like I ain't noticed, that them hoes had a thang for us.
I got a watch for every country, every time zone.
Even in the dark you see my stones, through a blindfold.
Nigga please, ery'body work a d block.
Or weed spot, 7-1-3 you think that we not.
Even when somebody call the laws, or the streets hot.
I'm just saying though, I'm back when they leave out.
Texas raised, I was born for this.
For the bread, hardships get torn for this.
Listen as the plot thickens, get this Glock I'm gripping.
Leave red on your blue, like a Detroit Piston nigga.

Yung Redd.
These niggas ain't real, let me make this clear.
We them niggas you fear, round here.
These niggas ain't real, that's the way that I feel.
Check the price of my deal, check the size of my wheels.

Lil' Ron.
Any situation, paper making's a must.
I get paid, cause I'm slanging that white stuff.
You niggas ain't like us, I could show you what I mean.
Between the niggas in your squad, you couldn't move a thing.
My mind on money, ain't shit funny.
You one of them lames, out would like to serve a dummy and think nothing of it.
I give in no observation, because my occupation.
Is to run the operation, with no cooperation.
From a snake, or a snitch.
I would advise you, to quit thinking for your bitch.
Can't get no cash, if ya sitting on your ass.
And you wondering why, niggas always blow right past.
Take a lot, of mind and muscle.
No broke at stacks, that's why I grind and hustle.
I'm focused on my stacks, me and Yung Redd we the next in line.
I don't know what you doing, but partna I'm get mine.

Yung Redd.
Every song, that I sing.
I still got a dollar for every stone in my chain, let me explain.
Three hundred dollar shoes, no suits included.
See them 22's sliding, no roof I lose it.
Ay real talk, partna this ain't music.
It ain't no secret, I'm the hardest in Houston.
So far so good, so star so hood.
Yeah them haters gon hate, but if they could they would good.
Get mine, no rules apply.
My wrist lit like the sky, on the 4th of July.
I'm a menace to society, a boy in the hood.
Chrome shoes, under every color toy in the hood nigga.
