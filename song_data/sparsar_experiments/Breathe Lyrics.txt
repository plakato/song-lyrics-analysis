Breathe Lyrics
by The Wow.

And this is how it feels when I ignore the words you spoke to me.
And this is where I lose myself when I keep running away from you!
And this is who I am when, when I don't know myself anymore.
And this is what I choose when it's all left up to me.

Breathe your life into me!
I can't feel you!
I'm falling, falling faster!
Breathe your life into me!
I still need you!
I'm falling, falling!
Breathe into me!
Breathe into me!

And this is how it looks when I am standing on the edge.
And this is how I break apart when I finally hit the ground!
And this is how it hurts when I pretend I don't feel any pain.
And this is how I disappear when I throw myself away!

Breathe your life into me!
I can't feel you!
I'm falling, falling faster!
Breathe your life into me!
I still need you!
I'm falling, falling!
Breathe into me!
Breathe into me!
Breathe into me!
Breathe into me!

Breathe your life into me!
Carry me home to you!
Breathe your life into me!
I can't feel you!
I'm falling, falling faster!
Breathe your life into me!
I still need you!
I'm falling, falling!
Breathe into me!

Breathe your life into me!
I'm falling, falling faster!
Breathe your life into me!
Falling, falling, falling, falling!
Breathe into me!
Breathe into me!
Breathe into me!
Breathe into me!!
