Out of It Lyrics
by Ruslan.

Produced by Curtiss King.

Yea, I'm so out of it, out of it.
Thought I made it really clear.
I do not belong here.
I'm so out of it, out of it.
They just want the same thing.
We just wanna change things.
I'm so out of it, out of it.

Let's go.
I'm gliding through the wind, spread high.
Yea, sorta close.
Peaks and valleys, know my limits.
I don't know no borders though.
No concept of county lines, no concept of altitude.
Freedom move about the country, the air here's kinda cool.
Ask 'em 'bout dinosaurs.
I tend to think we kinda new.
Ask 'em 'bout carnivores.
Yea bro that's my kind of food.
Tryna trip a ?, up.
I think it's kinda rude.
Like me cause I'm like them but I'm not.
So I'm just kinda cool.
Plus I know this climate too, well.
Just to sort of miss it.
Know to listen, fail to act.
Perhaps cause I feel sorta distant.
Still close, I rhyme different.
And still boast, tell 'em what time is it.
Be on jetlag, with no spacecraft.
Gravity don't exist so you pissed we replaced that?
Flowing open over oceans.
Outer space with no emotion.
Hoping if we get 'em open.
They could be moved by our devotion.

They keep tryna figure me out little me now.
Some punks start little me now, feeling me out.
They don't know.
Went in a match, went in a drought.
We still grow.
Let's reexamine, what is it now.
You really found new info.
With or without, living it out.
We been dope.
?, figure it out.
So simple.
In it but not of it.
They love, they wanna see it.
They ?, they wanna be it.
They covering ?, human beings.
I'm killing with the emceeing.
I'm running the whole show and expecting you ?
To do it the way I did it, I did it the way I loved it.
Moved I how we did and did it with no grudges.
Oh, we don't fit.
The labels won't touch us.
We started our own and did it with no budget.
Wait.
I don't know if that's something I should brag about.
On second I thought I don't know if I should've ever taken this rapper out.
I'm a dreamer I admit.
Maybe I should close my eyelids and go back to clouds.
Cause I'm outta this world.
Even up I still see clear like that's my house.
And that's the way, bread.
Even as a castaway said.
Even if I pass away, led on my feet with my God.
I sin, so I'm cool.
Outta this world, may face ridicule.
Imma keep flying high as we flying by.
Only way we know how to move, truth.
