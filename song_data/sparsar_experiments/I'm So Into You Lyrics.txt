I'm So Into You Lyrics
by SWV.

Boy there you go.
You're tellin me that you love me.
But boy you know.
That you belong to another girl who loves you.

You are so fine.

You blow my mind.
With the things you do to me.
She's not blind.
She's not blind.
Things you do for me.
All I know.

I'm so into you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Boy you got me so confused.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Friends ask how could.
I give myself to one who belongs to someone else.
They just don't know.
Your love's so good.
That they would want for themselves.

You are so fine.

You blow my mind.
With the things you do to me.
She's not blind.
She's not blind.
Things you do for me.
All I know.
I'm so into you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Boy you got me so confused.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm so into you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Boy you got me so confused.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

You're not, you're not mine.
You're not, you're not mine.
You're not, you're not mine.

You're not.
Ooh, what am I supposed to do.

I'm so into you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Boy you got me so confused.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
