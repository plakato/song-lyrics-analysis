Sugar Lips Lyrics
by Sworn In.


Drain me out.
Leave me to dry.
All I ever did was try, try, try.
Why, why, why?
Nights spent crying to a blank stare.
You don't care.

Now why don't you tell me the truth.
So sweet you hurt my tooth.
Now you tell me that you don't wanna hear it anymore.
Because what?
Life's a bore.
Life's a bore, bore, bore.

Sugar lips, sugar lips they make me weak.
Take back every bitter word I speak.
Sugar lips, dirty kiss is this the peak?
Cause things are still looking bleak darling.

You're so sweet, so fucking sweet.
Take my fill until I can't eat.
So take me in and use me up.
If it makes you feel alright I won't put up a fight.

Sugar lips, sugar lips they make me weak.
Take back every bitter word I speak.
Sugar lips, dirty kiss is this the peak?
Cause things are still looking bleak darling.

Let me lick the dust off your lips.
Bring me in with your hips.
Tell me to take just one more sip.
My minds about to fucking slip.

Have I had too much this time?
Drunk off of the blood red wine.
Tell me you love me.
Say it, say it, say it.
You owe me that so pay it, pay it, pay it.

Can't you hear me screaming that I love you to death.
And I don't really care if my name is on your breath.

Say my, say my name what?

Say my name.
Say my name.
You're my favorite little game.
And it's such a shame.
Things will never be the same.
Say my name.
Say my fucking name.
You're my favorite little game.
Fuck.

Say it, say it, say it.
Say it, say it, say it.
