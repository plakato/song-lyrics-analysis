A New Age Lyrics
by Xandria.

Ll Bells ringing, it's my wake-up shout.
I know the way out.
It's five past twelve, we'd better run.
A new age has begun.
Hush, little darling, don't you cry.
I am your favour.
I am your answer, I'm your light.
I'm your saviour.
Oh, I know where we're going, I hold the key to our fate.
Let's face a new morning before it's too late.
See! A new age has begun.
I will get you.
To a time of brightest light.
Empty is my name and I am right.
You think your life will bring you down.
Just clean up your mind.
I am enlightened, I have come.
Just to lead the blind.
Oh, no tar and no feathers with answers so close at hand.
I'll drive you to madness, but that's what you want!
See! A new age has begun....
I am the insect inside your mind.
The buzzing noise that you can't find.
Over your shoulder, inside your head.
I turn the switch from good to bad.
Material saviour with bank account.
Glad for the bliss that you have found.
A VISA-master, cards up my sleeve.
Appreciate what you leave.
See! A new age has begun.
