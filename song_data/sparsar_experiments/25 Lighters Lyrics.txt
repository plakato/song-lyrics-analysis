25 Lighters Lyrics
by Z-Ro.

Hold up Z-Ro the crooked AKA king of the ghetto 
Screwed Up Click soldier, for
life, 
You, know what I'm talking about. 
Mo' City stand up in this motherfucker 
You know what I'm saying: 
My nigga Grady in this bitch.. What'S up my nigga 
Huh inside out that boy Harv done
touch ground, 
Hold up man., You know what I'm saying: Ridgemond for life, 
Ridgemond riders, nigga, Ridgemond, hard heads, 
Huh y'all, feel me: man rest in peace to that nigga, Jody 
That, nigga, LL man.! You know what I'm saying: 
Shit man, it's fucked up, man 
Rest in peace to to that nigga, E-mo, 
We gon' hold it down.. You know what I'm talking about 
And! That'S real talk, 
 
25 Lighters on my dresser. Yes, sir 
Got a bad black bitch that drives a black Kompressor 
You know I'm smoking on that herb 
Every damn day just to calm my damn nerves, 
Screwed Up Click, ain't, never gon' switch 
Nigga build a ditch for a motherfucker snitch 
Talking to the laws given up Info 
Catch me at the pad black lamp or smoking indo 
Sipping on drank on a whole liter 
This for nigga moe. I got a 9 millimeter 
And a .45, I'm a keep. It live, 
In 08', like I did in 95', 
That was the year. I made it clear 
Wrecking on the microphone to get away from here: 
I'm reppin' for the south, with diamonds in my mouth 
And diamonds, on my hands.
