Guardian Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.


Man down.
Into the darkness they hunt you.
Tracking blood upon the streets.
Security is breached.
Political Elite.
Who's the savior when the martyr knows your name?

Guardian....

Pixels of light.
Infrared from the sights.
That shed upon you.
Facing the enemy.
Fascist supremacy.
Fight to live another day.

It's time to rise up.
United, we stand.
Divided, we fall.
Evolution calling.

Rise up.
United, we stand.
Divided, we fall.
Evolution calling.

Insurrection.
This time we're playing for keeps.
Arming police like the military, it's obscene.
And they're stalking the streets.

Rise up.
United, we stand.
Divided, we fall.
Evolution calling.

Rise up.
United, we stand.
Divided, we fall.
Evolution calling.

Torn inside.
We've fallen to another world.
Are we so cold.
And out of love?

Keep on trying.
Hold the child.
Face is crying.
Changing Times.

Rise up.
United, we stand.
Divided, we fall.
Evolution calling.

Rise up.
We stand.
We fall.
Evolution calling.

Rise up.
We stand.
We fall.
Evolution calling.
