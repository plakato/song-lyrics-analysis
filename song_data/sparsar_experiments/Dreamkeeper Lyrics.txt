Dreamkeeper Lyrics
by Xandria.

I've been dreaming all those years.
I've been sleeping for so long.
In a diamond sky of lonely worlds.

All your eyes stare up at me.
As if I was wide awake.
And I only can live my own curse.

I will keep your dream.
Make it live for real.
Only just for a moment.

I will send a dying rose.
For you all to be close.
To its scent that has never been.

All the colours to unfold.
All the magic we behold.
In the life we share in fantasy.

I will keep your dream.
Make it live for real.
Only just for a moment.

Say these words again.
Don't leave me alone.
When my own dreams have finally died.

Keep my dreams now.
I keep yours forever.
Save my hope now.
I save yours forever.

Hold me, help me.
Carry me upon your wings.
To save my soul with your love.

I will keep your dream.
Make it live for real.
Only just for a moment.

Say these words again.
Don't leave me alone.
When my own dreams have finally died.

Keep my dreams now.
I keep yours forever.
Save my hope now.
I save yours forever.

Hold me, help me.
Will you be my dreamkeeper?
