California Dreamer Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

California dreamer.
Tell me why did you go.
I carved your ever fading figure.
Into the ever dying snow.

I'll be around, I'll be around, I'll be around.
Like a teenager in town.
Where all the other young lovers are found.

And I think I might have heard you on the radio.
But the radio waves were like snow.

And you were dreaming of Los Angeles.
While I was singing songs you know.
You quietly gave away the winter clothes I made for you.
While I made angels in the snow.

I never would have looked if you just asked me to.
Or come to me before the preacher.
Now you're a survivor....

And I just thought I might have heard you on the radio.
But the radio waves were like snow.
I just thought I might have heard you on the radio.
But the radio waves were like snow.

Do the young stay pretty, do the pretty stay quick?
You know but you never surrender.
The city doesn't belong to you anymore.
California dreamer.

You dream of seasons that never die.
And you're the oceans that never touch the ice.

You dream of seasons that never die.
And you're the oceans that never touch the ice.
Surrender, the city asunder.
Pictures, getting younger and younger....

And I think I might have heard you on the radio.
But the radio waves were like snow.

Do the young stay pretty, do the pretty stay quick?
You know but you never surrender.
The city doesn't belong to you anymore.
California dreamer.

I'll be around, I'll be around, I'll be around.
Like a teenager in town.
With all the other young lovers.
Their mothers been found.
California dreamer.
