No More (Remix) Lyrics
by 3LW.

Nas.
Everyday she walk by.
See me on the same block.
Same crew, like she never seen rocks.
Chain watch, rims blue.
Different color boots on, park Yukon.
You predicates ex-cons, rip arms, bettin' chips.
Puff medicine play my gangsta beats.
Tunnel bangers, Flex, Clue tapes bang in the streets.
I'm just a fly, thuggish baller shorty anxious to meet.
Till I die keep wanting to head mink to the feet.
But shorty jail bait, might get me five to life.
Maybe in time you can be Nas's wife.
Place school, study law.
I'mma pay your tuition.
Come on campus, buy you books.
Do your babysitting.
My unusual style make your future unwild.
When you get older I'mma bless you with a child.
See now you was unaware that this thug had affection.
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection.

1 - 3LW.
It's either you will.
Either you won't.
Sometimes you do.
Sometimes you don't.
Sometimes it's yes.
Other times it's no.
But I can't take it no more.
Take your wrong and make it right.
Just say you can make up your mind.
Is it serious or isn't it?
Cause I can't take it no more.

Make 'em clap to this....

Baby, baby you keep.
Putting things before me.
But I was there for you when you had nothing.
So baby, baby.
Basically it's them or me.
Now or never.
Give me all or nothing.

Make 'em clap to this....

Baby, baby.
You keep telling me you're changing.
You promise you will be a better man.
But no soon as you see your peeps.
There you go switching out on me.
And we're back at square one again.

Nas.
Don 3, can't get with me.
Y'all just a child-child.
Maybe I can get you with little Sammie and Bow Wow.
Please girls try to understand me now-now.
Like my little sisters I'mma hold you down-down.
Got the whole world in your hands.
Three little woman got these young.
boys tryna be their man.
Do your thing shorty but if they get disrespectful.
Get on your cell phone call big brother Esco.
Now let's go.

3LW.
Cause all this back and forth.
In and out, ups and downs.
Is beginning to wear me out.
See you gotta tell me now.
Tell me now.
Don't wait till the end.
It's either me or your friends.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Trackmasters.
Remix, Trackmasters, Remix.
Remix, Precision, Remix.
We about to make ya clap to this.
Remix, uh.
