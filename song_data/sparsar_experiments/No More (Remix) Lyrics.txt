No More (Remix) Lyrics
by 3LW.

Nas 
Everyday she walk by 
See me on the same block: 
Same crew like she never seen, rocks 
Chain watch, rims blue 
Different color boots on park, Yukon 
You, predicates, ex-cons, rip, arms, bettin' chips, 
Puff medicine play my gangsta beats 
Tunnel bangers Flex, Clue, tapes, bang in the Streets 
I'm, just a fly, thuggish baller, shorty, anxious to meet 
Till. I die. Keep wanting to head mink to the feet: 
But shorty jail bait might get me five to life 
Maybe in time you can be Nas's, wife, 
Place school study, law, 
I'mma pay your tuition 
Come on campus, buy you books, 
Do. Your babysitting 
My unusual style make your future unwild 
When you get older I'mma bless you with a child 
See. Now you was unaware that this thug had affection. 
Let me be your angel and I'll. Be your protection.

It's! Either you will 
Either, you won't 
Sometimes, you do 
Sometimes, you don't 
Sometimes, it's yes! 
Other times it's no 
But! I can't take it. No more 
Take your wrong and make it right. 
Just say you can make up your mind, 
Is it serious or isn't it 
Cause? I can't take it no more 
 
Make'em, clap to this ... 
 
Baby baby. You keep 
Putting things before me, 
But. I was there for you when you had nothing 
So, baby, baby, 
Basically, it's them or me, 
Now or never. 
Give me all or nothing 
, 
Make'em, clap to this ... 
 
Baby baby 
You, keep telling me you're changing 
You promise. You will be a better man 
But! No soon, as you see your peeps 
There, you go switching out on me. 
And we're back at square one again: 
 
Nas, 
Don 3 can't get with me 
Y'all, just a child-child 
Maybe. I can get you with little Sammie and Bow Wow 
Please girls. Try to understand me. Now-Now 
Like, my little sisters, I'mma hold you down-down 
Got the whole world. In your hands, 
Three little woman got these young
boys tryna, be their man 
Do your thing shorty, but if they get disrespectful 
Get on your cell phone call big brother, Esco 
Now, let's go 
 
3LW 
Cause, all this back and forth 
In and out ups and downs 
Is, Beginning to wear me out 
See you got ta. Tell me now 
Tell me now: 
Don't wait till the end 
It's either me or your friends: 
Yeah yeah yeah
