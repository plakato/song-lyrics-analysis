Since Lyrics
by Zinc.

Whenever i leave you i can't wait to get back to you you're like the link.
that's mising boy i miss your cherry kisses. whatever  i'll be there good.
like a feather one smile is all i needed.

matter how high i fly i think of you to me the sky seems to be falling and the.
sun don't want to be shining anymore since i last saw you.

I didn't imagine how my life would be without you you always embrace me boy i.
thank you for your honesty and i'll be ever thankful overjoyed cuz i'm lucky.

I can't believe that it was only yesterday when i last saw your face and i'm.
not ashamed that i want you with me today back in my arms, with me is where.
