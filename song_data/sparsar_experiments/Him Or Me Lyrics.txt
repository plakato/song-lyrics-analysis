Him Or Me Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man 
You have got me thinking, 
Something's going down 
Cause lately here you ain't been much around 
You've, been hanging out, 
 
Jay-R 
Baby! What'S on your mind, 
Maybe some other guy 
Girl. It ain't really about no mystery 
Now. It'S really not hard to tell 
It's just something that I can feel 
And my honey ain't being straight with me: 
Oh. Is it ... 
 
3rd, Storee 
Is it him or is it me 
Tell me? What'S it gon na be 
Think? It'S time you deal straight up. 
Get real it's now girl or never 
, 
Lil'Man 
You say that I'm tripping 
Play me like I'm wrong 
Keep this up and I might be gone 
Before. We end this song 
 
Jay-R 
Baby. What'S up with you 
Was you thinking that I'm your fool! 
Girl! We got ta clear up this mystery 
If, you're gon na be down with me. 
Then you got ta, be âÂЂËœround. Just me 
Ain't about to just let you dis on me 
Oh. Is it ... 
 
3rd, Storee 
Is it him or is it me 
Tell me? What'S it gon na be 
Think, it's time you deal straight up, 
Get real, it's now girl or never 
, 
Is it him or is it me 
Tell me? What'S it gon na be 
Think? It'S time you deal straight up, 
Get, real, it's now girl or never .
 
D-Smoove 
Now, it's now or never, I'm much too clever, 
Taking trips around the world. It don't matter whatever 
The price may be. It'S either him or me. 
It dress fresh at the toe in my latest Tommy 
Laugh with you. He don't even walk with you 
Talk with you. He don't do the things I do 
Are for you. You know that my love is true 
And. I do anything you want me to come on. 
 
3rd, Storee, 
Is it him or is it me 
Tell me? What'S it gon na be 
Think? It'S time you deal straight up, 
Get real. It'S now girl or never 
, 
D-Smoove 
What. He got that. I don't have 
Do, he do his thing. Do he ever make you laugh 
Do he ever make you smile make. You feel proud. 
Make you wan na put yo hands up scream loud 
Why. You wan na keep a brotha like D waiting, anticipating 
While he out on the street, mad playa, hatin' 
He, steady, stating that you and him will be together. 
I guarantee you go with him. You'Ll fall like a feather 
 
3rd, Storee 
Is it him or is it me 
Tell me? What'S it gon na be 
Think? It'S time you deal straight up, 
Get real, it's now girl or never.
