Him Or Me Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man.
You have got me thinking.
Something's going down.
Cause lately here you ain't been much around.
You've been hanging out.

Jay-R.
Baby what's on your mind.
Maybe some other guy.
Girl it ain't really about no mystery.
Now it's really not hard to tell.
It's just something that I can feel.
And my honey ain't being straight with me.
Oh is it....

3rd Storee.
Is it him or is it me.
Tell me what's it gonna be.
Think it's time you deal straight up.
Get real, it's now girl or never.

Lil'Man.
You say that I'm tripping.
Play me like I'm wrong.
Keep this up and I might be gone.
Before we end this song.

Jay-R.
Baby what's up with you.
Was you thinking that I'm your fool.
Girl we gotta clear up this mystery.
If you're gonna be down with me.
Then you gotta be âÂЂËœround just me.
Ain't about to just let you dis on me.
Oh is it....

3rd Storee.
Is it him or is it me.
Tell me what's it gonna be.
Think it's time you deal straight up.
Get real, it's now girl or never.

Is it him or is it me.
Tell me what's it gonna be.
Think it's time you deal straight up.
Get real, it's now girl or never.

D-Smoove.
Now it's now or never, I'm much too clever.
Taking trips around the world it don't matter, whatever.
The price may be, it's either him or me.
It dress fresh at the toe in my latest Tommy.
Laugh with you, he don't even walk with you.
Talk with you, he don't do the things I do.
Are for you, you know that my love is true.
And I do anything you want me to come on.

3rd Storee.
Is it him or is it me.
Tell me what's it gonna be.
Think it's time you deal straight up.
Get real, it's now girl or never.

D-Smoove.
What he got that I don't have.
Do he do his thing do he ever make you laugh.
Do he ever make you smile make you feel proud.
Make you wanna put yo hands up scream loud.
Why you wanna keep a brotha like D waiting, anticipating.
While he out on the street mad playa hatin'.
He steady stating, that you and him will be together.
I guarantee you go with him you'll fall like a feather.

3rd Storee.
Is it him or is it me.
Tell me what's it gonna be.
Think it's time you deal straight up.
Get real, it's now girl or never.
