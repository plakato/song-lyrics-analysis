Ace in the Hole Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

Pete Nice.
Ace is the place with the helpful hardware.
Prime's got a spare, it's truth or dare.

MC Serch.
Stare into the face of a kid who is a hypocrite.
Take all that hate -- why don't you try flippin it?

Pete Nice.
I never went out out drinkin Pepsi sips.
And never laced up my boots in fruity bits.
I ain't British so my fetish ain't knighthood.
Cause no one wears sequins in my neighborhood.

MC Serch.
Cause my feet are firmly planted on the concrete.
High-top fade, with no need for a blonde streak.
Now let me chill, it's a sign of maturity.
And I would never steal a chant from a Black Greek fraternity.

Elvis Elvis baby, too bold, too bold.
Ice Ice baby, no soul, no soul.

Pete Last year we +Gassed+ ya up.
Serch Now herbals fill your pastures.
Pete Masters of movement and mayhem.
Serch while last year record shows stopped for a racist.
Pete Countin cards and blackjacks, throwin aces.
Serch Places I've seen and I've seen all types of grills.
Pete It's the K.M.D. ?? G fills.
Serch Which builds up the fence for the fibs you're sprayin.
Pete My ace is in the hole.
Serch So whatcha playin?

* Daddy Rich scratches Zev Love X saying.
K.M.D. and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole, I mean soul.. *.

Zev Love X.
That's it right? Check it.
Humm goes the kick, check out how I flick it.
As the thumb presses quick, suckers on the mix.
And yeah the Birthstone Kid, Zev Love X.
And Mr. X took a lickin, so Onyx what's the time it is?

Onyx.
Time is to get my cocka-doodle rooster yappin.
Wakin devil heads with my poor style rappin.
Time is a quarter shorter that in order be sorta.
Tap in my line and just Knowledge me.

Zev Love X.
Eats the baby food with no bib.
And ad-lib from the Reverand Rib's crib.
The lesson is.. YEAHHH, some ?? true and fix.
Yeah all garbage no fib.
I'm talkin bout the Nubians  the black man.
No sugar sweet snacks for the sour sap.
To see home, why should I have to check the maps?
The haps, is negative I give many many caps.
For a heavy heavy gun, about a, ton it weighs.
That keep you, bustin off for days as sure as every sucker pays.
In time, tis mine.
The cause is a hole where the bass is ace for rhymes.

Onyx.
Evils in my midst bound to get crushed, rushed.
Helps to manage, we're Kausin Much Damage.
So we go on and on, word bond.
Mics they got torn by the Kause long as Jimmy Cracks Corn bores.
Hamhand gets no support.
By the God Squad, God Body, for short call me God Born.
Headnod to this like a King of Swing, thing and.

Is an ace in the hole.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh a ace in the hole!
Yeahh.. ace in the hole?
Uh-huh, uh-huh, a ace in the hole!
