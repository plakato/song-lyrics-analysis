Do You Want It
by 69 Boyz.


Lady in the club on Friday night.
In the V.I.P. underneath the light.
Saw a real fine cutie with some hazel eye.
Sitting with her friends eating shrimp and fries.
So I walk over to her and shout some game.
And say Hey there baby whats ya name.
You say Michelle my bell and I'm from the A-T-L.
Nice to meet you cutie pie.
You new in town and I be's the guy.
To take you out and do things you like.
Matter of fact we start tonight.
Going to have a little private party.
Spreading oil all over your body.
She said if you ain't friend.
Before we go let me ask you a little something.

2x.
Do you want it baby?
Yeah I want you.
So get on it baby.
Yeah true.
Do you need it baby?
You know I do.
Wanna eat it baby?
If you want me to.

My grandmamma sent me to the grocery store.
To get some type of foods and aerosol.
But when I got the aisle with the milk and cheese.
Saw this cute girl and tig ol bitties.
Why here with the big old thigh.
So I hid behind the moon pies.
Took a quick second think I found my word.
Then slid my finger right next to her.
Say hey girl watcha got cooking.
I was working so hard in the grocery store.
That I forgot what my grandmamma sent me for.
Went home and got bus stop.
But these girls were so fine it was working cussed out.
Because the very next day.
He be the one that I heard say.

2x.

Girls 3 at the carwash.
Getting my trizz-up shiz-ine bizz-up.
A girl pulls up don't stank a lane.
And got out her car looking like Tyra Banks.
Now believe you and me she was a cutie.
With a big round bread with a booty.
Got out the seat parked up the car.
Payed for the wash and the armorall.
Went back to em switched the paint.
Say I paid for the wash and armorall.
And the wax guess the wax job did it.
Cuz she fit it and broke down them deala's.
Went over to her crib.
Later on that evening.

Just so I can hear her say.

2x.
