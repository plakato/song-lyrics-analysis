Do You Want It
by 69 Boyz.


Lady in the club on Friday night 
In, the V.I.P. underneath the light 
Saw a real fine cutie, with some hazel eye 
Sitting with her friends, eating shrimp and fries 
So. I walk over to her and shout some game. 
And say: Hey there, baby whats, ya, name, 
You, say Michelle my bell and I'm from the A-T-L 
Nice to meet you cutie pie, 
You new in town and I be's the guy 
To. Take you out and do things you like 
Matter of fact. We start tonight 
Going to have a little private party, 
Spreading oil, all over your body. 
She said: if you ain't friend 
Before we go. Let me ask you a little something: 
 
 2x 
Do. You want it baby 
Yeah! I want you 
So get on it. Baby! 
Yeah, true 
Do, you need it baby. 
You know I do 
 Wan na eat it baby 
If. You want me to 
 
My grandmamma, sent me to the grocery store, 
To get some type of foods and aerosol 
But. When I got the aisle with the milk and cheese 
Saw, this cute girl and tig ol bitties 
Why here with the big old thigh 
So, I hid behind the moon, pies 
Took. A quick second think I found my word. 
Then slid my finger right next to her 
Say, hey girl, watcha got cooking, 
I was working so hard in the grocery store 
That. I forgot what my grandmamma sent me for 
Went home and got bus stop 
But. These girls were so fine. It was working cussed out. 
Because, the very next day, 
He be the one that I heard say: 
 
 2x 
 
Girls 3 at the carwash 
Getting, my trizz-up shiz-ine bizz-up 
A girl pulls up, don't stank a lane. 
And got out her car. Looking like Tyra Banks, 
Now. Believe you and me she was a cutie 
With, a big round bread with a booty 
Got out the seat parked up the car 
Payed for the wash and the armorall 
Went back to em switched the paint 
Say I paid for the wash and armorall 
And the wax Guess the wax job did it 
Cuz she fit it and broke down them. Deala'S 
Went over to her crib 
Later on that evening 

Just. So I can hear her say: 
 
, 2x
