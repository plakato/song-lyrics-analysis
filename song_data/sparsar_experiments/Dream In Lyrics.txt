Dream In Lyrics
by Virtuoso.


Dreams! things aren't all that they.
seem.
Dreams! life's not all about cream.
Dreams! please say it all was a dream.
Cause the fight for real life's.
Like a horrible scene.

The enemy's here.
They trying ta' take us.
Let 'em see how the weaponry.
Makes their frame break up.
It seems threads of life.
Make up our stitch in time.
After the bomb dropped.
Dawn got a different shine.
I find that it burns.
Like a fire on the hearth.
I learned this day would come.
They were liars from the start.
My pride is in my heart.
So you'll never know.
How far Miguel will go.
Until they digging up your skeletal.
Remains I see change.
On the horizon.
Or is it just the next bomber as it flies in.
Wise men once let me know.
If it's not worth it then let it go.
Or pop first and dead your foe.
Now it seems like the options are dropping.
There's no more talking.
Smart bombs are locked in.
And more often than not.
Innocent people gotta get dropped.
For their leaders horrible plot.
While the one calling the shots.
Fly free as a bird.
Words they speak are absurd.
Though they're frequently heard.
Cause they control the radio.
It's crazy though.
The dj's won't play me though.
Unless I line their bank account.
With crazy dough.
And even corporate labels.
Deep into debt, through spending in deficit.
Bootlegging and internet.
Meet the new me see a brain that's been cloned.
Silicone flesh meshed with titanium bones.
I'm aiming my poems, at dictators.
Reigning on thrones.
Who raised their seeds cold.
In a cradle of stone.
Then cast them in the street.
Never gave them a home.
The ones who shun the path.
That our saviors have shown.
We stole all of the crops.
That the natives have grown.
We must stick together.
No one made it alone.
Cause radiation give you cancer.
In your face from your phone.
Or your throat from the smoke.
When you blazing a bone.
When you don't agree with leaders.
And behavior they've shown.
Speak out there's no effect.
If your state is unknownI got sick of talking.
And caught aids in my poem.
Now I spit from a coffin.
And a grave is my dome.
I grown by own body.
From dirt and grime.
It blows my damn mind.
Like my brain was a landmine.
And I can't find.
A path out this nightmare.
Does it end right here.
Or extend for light years?!

Dreams...etc.
