Deuce (Live) Lyrics
by Ace Frehley.

Get up.
And get your grandma outta here.
Pick up.
Old Jim is workin' hard this year.
Baby.
Do the things I says to do.
Baby, if you're feeling good.
Baby, if you're feeling nice.
You know your man is workin' hard.
He's worth a deuce.
Honey.
Don't push your man behind his years.
Baby.
Stop cryin' all your tears.
Baby.
Do the things I says to do, do it.
Baby, if you're feeling good.
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice.
You know your man is workin' hard.
He's worth a deuce.
Baby, if you're feeling good.
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice.
You know your man is workin' hard.
I wanna hear you, yeah.
