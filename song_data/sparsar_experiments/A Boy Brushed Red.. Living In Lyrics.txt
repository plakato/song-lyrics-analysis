A Boy Brushed Red.. Living In Lyrics
by Underoath.

Can you feel your heart beat racing?
Can you taste the fear in her sweat?
You've done this wrong, it's too far gone.
These sheets tell of regret.
I admit that I'm just a fool for you, I'm just a fool for you.
Here is where we both go wrong.
Tonight's your last chance to do exactly what you want to do.
And this could be my night, this is what makes me feel alive.
Makes you feel alive.
Here is where we both go wrong.
So tie me up and toss this key cause for now we're living.
In this moment that we both ignore the truth.
It's all over, it's all over.
I feel your heart against mine.
So take a breath and close your eyes, eyes.
Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing.
My heart is dead, it's way past beating.
Something has gone terribly wrong.
I'm scared, you're scared, we're scared of this.
I never thought we'd make it out alive.
I never told you but it's all in your goodbyes.

Well, look who's dying now.
Slit wrists sleeping with the girl next door.
I always knew you were such a sucker for that.
It doesn't matter what you say.
You never mattered anyway, I never mattered anyway.
In this moment that we both ignore the truth.
It's all over, it's all over.
I feel your heart against mine.
So take a breath and close your eyes, eyes.
Your lungs have failed and they're both stopped breathing.
My heart is dead, it's way past beating.
Something has gone terribly wrong.
I'm scared, you're scared, we're scared of this.
I never thought we'd make it out alive.
I never told you but it's all in your goodbyes.

Don't shake, I hate to see you tremble, trembling.
You've lost your touch, haven't you?
And I'm so addicted, so addicted.
Your lungs have failed and they're both stopped breathing.
My heart is dead, it's way past beating.
Something has gone terribly wrong.
Go wrong!
Your lungs have failed and they're both stopped breathing.
My heart is dead, it's way past beating.
Something has gone terribly wrong.
I'm scared, you're scared, we're scared of this.
I never thought we'd make it out alive.
I never told you but it's all in your goodbyes.

I never thought we'd make it out alive.
I never thought we'd make it out alive.
I never thought we'd make it out alive.
It's all in your goodbyes.
