The Worst (Remix) Lyrics
by Unkown.

Uhh whats ups? You say you doing fine.
I see your doing great, smiling, laughing all the time.
Because the fucked up part is you used to be mine.
Thats right. We would love each other, cry,and smile.
And now i haven't seen that in a while.
This hurt is kind of wild because everywhere i go i see you.
Everywhere i go i swear your there.
Your kind of like a ghost, i wouldn't name you casper though.
Everytime i see you. i swear i ain't happy though.
Because the thought of you is just the rain to the storm.
One thought, goes from cloudy days to a hurricane.
All i have to say is you better hurry, mane.
Not alot of time till i finally break. and let me tell you now.
Maybe then i won't have to strength to wake, up. no i can't get up.
Out of bed, out of this haze, or out of my head.
Swear you placed cuffs of me and you just tryna fuck with me.
Opened up my heart, and accidentally forgot to re-buckle me.
Because now i let too much bullshit in, kind of wish i didn't let you in. mane.
Uhh they say i dont need you, i dont need you, i dont need you. but i want you.
How the fuck could you want people that hurt you?
Take a bullet for them, but they left you shot in the lungs.
They say i dont mean to, i dont mean to, i dont mean to. but i love you.
How can you love someone who puts themselve above you?
How can you love someone who doesn't care about you?
And says just to forget all the time they spent with you?
Yeah thats right. We living in a fucked up reality.
With confused people and their fucked up mentality.
