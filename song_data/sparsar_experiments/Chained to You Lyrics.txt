Chained to You Lyrics
by Von Grey.

I am not your keeper.
Ill break my back carrying you around.
Why should I be your savior.
When you burry yourself in the ground.
Your pain knows its way.
Around the maze of my veins.
Hits my heart, even though I pray.
That my strength will not be slain.
Youre going down, Im going too.
Can't walk away, Im chained to you.
What am I supposed to do.
If you go my heart goes too.
Your tears awoke my thirst.
Instilled the fear in my bones.
Our love is like a curse.
Your fears became my own.
Your love turned into chains.
This is insane.
Youre going down, Im going too.
Can't walk away, Im chained to you.
What am I supposed to do.
If you go my heart goes too.
Youre going down Im going too.
Can't walk away, Im chained to you.
What am I supposed to do.
If you go my heart goes too.
Youre going down, Im going too.
Youre going down, Im going too.
Youre going down, Im going too.
