Mids Lyrics
by Zippo Hebs.


This is some somber shit though, don't get fucking pumped about it.

I admit the crew if we got shit to do, but don't allow no takin photos.
Roach burns, blunt residue, on my sheets and my hoodies, and my fingers too.
Days are blue, my arizona's too, I.
bought an O on the low, now my brain is stew, bitch.
Oh, the flow, it's a miracle, sub-frozone, get the Theraflu, underdog, then i.
carried you, when your heart stop beating then I buried you.
Under the trees, down by the lake.
Wind blew your hair in my face.
Can't believe in havin any other way cause you're really everything to me.
You're special like K to me, got these.
funny little things that you did, and the.
Words that you said, and they did for me... whatever segue, next scene.
Music: putting my two cents on my chest like a broke ass rapper.
Video's hard cause I never know what I might do when i'm on that camera.

Roll out with the one-two bruisers, nooses I'ma name you after.
Take all the radio addicts out cause I've motherfucking had it.
I'ma master with this magic, bitch I'm elastic with this tongue.
Got a masters putting you bitches on blast with a bachelors purchasing guns.
I'ma disaster, 911, six people, I bag them up.
The ripper, I am, the bullets, they jam, up in the barrel of the gun.
The scoreboards one to none, I'm weeded and now I'm gone.
I'm blunted and outta my lyrics so now I'm done, fuck it.
