Mmmm since I met you.
I knew what time it was.
I even told you that.
You still need convincing?
Why you holding back?
I even showed you where my mama lived.
I even showed you who my mama is.
Yeeaaah mmmm.
Baaabe come truuee.

So you can.
Pop shit, turn up.
Make me turn up.
But you're gonna'.
Just come back around.
Just come back around.
So baby.
Kiss me, fuck me.
Miss me, love me.
Cause you're gonna'.
Just come back around.
Just come back around.

Cause you're my boomerang.
Yeaahh, you're my boomerang.

You know I got that come back.
So girl you know you gon' come back.
Talking all that shit.
You know I got some comebacks.
Oh you pregnant?
Girl I want my cum back.
Oh you in love?
Bitch I want my love back.
Tell me where the loves at.
Tell me where the cuffs at.
Tell me where the blunts at.
Let's get faded.
Show me that you need it.
Show me you believe it.
Show me that you don't need to.
See me get famous, woa-ooh.
You know, you know, you know, oohhh.
Yeaahh.

So you can.
Pop shit, turn up.
Make me turn up.
Cause you're gonna'.
Just come back around.
Just come back around.
So baby.
Kiss me, fuck me.
Miss me, love me.
Cause you're gonna'.
Just come back around.
Just come back around.

Cause you're my boomerang.
Yeaahh, you're my boomerang.

I could grind with you.
Relax my mind.
Take my time with you.
Even spend.
My whole life with you.
