Never Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


So, they told me that I could never be that nigga.
Never be no rapper, never get no bigger.
I guess them niggas wrong ‘cause I'm all grown up.
As soon as my shit drop I'll be all blown up, whaat.

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane.
I be fly to the face can't say that.
I feel your pain.
‘Cause I'm too damn young, I'm too damn cool.
I'm colder than ice flakes and sharper than ice skates.
Post up with my nigga she saying I like you.
Baby give me sugar tell a nigga Type 2.
Say she coming over she gon' be here like 2.
Got a girl with her I'm hoping I like too.
Loving how I'm living I ain't picking nothing different.
If the sky holds the ribbon I'm ripping right through my gifts and.
Showing ‘em off lately I'm blowing ‘em off.

Mic checky why you defending the bullshit.
Gas niggas up throw my finger now I pull it.
Numero Uno, you don't get too close, the fake niggas drop from my world,.
Pluto.

Hope I never be that nigga that you never heard.
It would crush me ‘til my bones I ain't never scurrred.
Weed keep me suspended but I ain't never nerd.
You the type to claim a city but ain't never thurrr, nigga.
This 20 shit kicking in.
Came a long way and I started this shit in 2010.
‘Member when I first started rapping got some funny grins.
Now I'm backstage conversatin' with some funny twins.
Yea, ladies put your hands up, uh uh, uh uh, fellas put your hands up.
Shouts to all the women that can hold they man up.
If that nigga busy his lady can roll his gram up, uh.
Check the grammar I'm blowing like Santa Ana.
Throwing tantrums like I'm fucking up a Pamper.
Stretch your vocab boy your style so cramped up.
Wanna be cool lil nigga getcha fans up, what?
