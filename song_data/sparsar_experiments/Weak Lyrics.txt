Weak Lyrics
by SWV.


I don't know what it is that you've done to me.
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way.
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing.
It's a feeling that I want to stay.

Cause my heart starts beating triple time.
With thoughts of loving you on my mind.
I can't figure out just what to do.
When the cause and cure is you.

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak.
I lose all control and something takes over me.
In a daze and it's so amazing.
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me.
By my side, I swallow my pride.
Your love is so sweet.
It knocks me right off of my feet.
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak.

Time after time, after time I try to fight it.
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on.
Resistance is down.
When you're around, cries fading.
In my condition, I don't want to be alone.

I try hard to fight it.
No way can I deny it.
You're love's so sweet.
Knocks me off my feet.

Blood starts racing through my veins.

Boy, it's something I can't explain.

Something 'bout the way you do.
The things you do-ooo-ooo, it.

Ohh, off my feet.
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak.
