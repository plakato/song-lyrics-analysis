PoisonIvy2 Lyrics
by Xali.


My frustration is high.
My patience died.
Ya'll don't really know my hate inside.
I'm like an ape on the vine.
With an AK and a 9mm.
With my mind off the reefer.
Give you lines full of ether.
Right through the speaker.
The righteous speaker is finally fed up.
They told me preach, I'm in the streets protected with my lead tucked.
Not the aggressor but niggas push the pressure up.
Try to fuck the method up.
Like this life wasn't meant for us.
Slow down.
It's hard living on my own now.
Since Pop passed.
I drop knowledge and blow clouds.
Of dope, loud.
So potent, your soul open.
With no doubts.
Cops coming the chrome focused.
On minorities.
We are not the priorities to these Government authorities.
Birth certificate in all caps.
Now what you call that.
Capital ownership.
Call you chattel, now know this shit.

What you gon' do when they inject your ID.
Through your IV.
By mind, like Poison Ivy. Huh?

See the pineal gland inside me.
Help me see through the evil you define peace.

I'm like.
Pigs show hatred for pigmentation.
Niggas didn't pick these races.
Like they tryn'a rid the nation.
Of all the melanin.
Cause they know the second that it settles, the God's gon' rebel.
Send these devils to hell again.
Get my conscious up the levels.
Prevalent to relevant.
Come to this dimension.
No comfort, get demented.
Truth, did I mention.
Will make you question if living is worth it.
Cause corruption is so clean and their system is perfect.
American working.
The terror is certain.
The predator lurking.
Check your purpose.
Before they double check your persons.
The mark of the beast.
The harboring feast.
And if you don't comply it's harder to eat.
Cause they gon' cut you off.

Now tell me what's the cost.
