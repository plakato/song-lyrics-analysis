Badass Lyrics
by Yungstar.

Uhhhhhhhhh badass lil' boy.

He's a badass, badass little boy.
Throwed yung playa slangin candy red toy.
He's a badass, badass little boy.
Throwed yung playa slangin candy red toy.
He's a badass, badass little boy.
Throwed yung playa slangin candy red toy.
He's a badass, badass little boy.
Throwed yung playa slangin candy red toy.

Haha ain't nobody as bad as me man.
I'm a badass little boy haha.

Lil Flex.
Post it up on the corner with more cheese than Ritz.
Eatin scrambled eggs and grits.
Watchin hoes do splits.
Fly bitch with tits, try to fit in my mix.
Shit you think I'm bad now you should have seen me at 6.
At the age of 11, I was breakin into houses.
Stealin games, pocket change, stickin dick in yo spouses.
Sellin crack, smokin sacks on a day to day basis.
About failed junior high and got kicked out of Hastings.
Serve places on the cool, I'm a goddamn fool.
Inquiring minds wanna know why you treat us so cruel.
Cause I'm bad to the bone, I act young but I'm grown.
18 with my own home, I'm the king on the throne.
Me and Fee blown tree in the back of the lobby.
3 strikes, 2 assults, and a third degree robbery.
You heard what they said I'm a badass boy.
Southwest in Houton Texas you gotta feel that boy.

Lil Flex.
I walk the halls like malls, I role cigars like stars.
When the bell ring for lunch I return to my car.
Beep beep goes my pager, 911 must be major.
Check my wallet for a condom, that's my bitch, maybe later.
Should I go and smash her stuff or shoot some hoops at the gym.
Go report to the principle's office That wasn't me that was him.
All lunches I'm there, shiny pieces that glare.
My shoes be Nike Air, I gotta get me a pair.
Positioned boppers by lockers, just can't keep comin with them choppers.
I rip my dockers, they look gay huh, but I'm the young Betty Crocker.
Who's bad with 2 pistols? got a mouth full of crystal.
Runnin from the security guards while they are blowin their whistle.
Skipped a week of detention and got 3 days suspension.
Referal read failure to comply, Flex would not pay attention.
A lot of people say I'm good but I look very sneaky.
Come here little girl, you seem like the type that'd be freaky.

Cookie.
Oh girl look at him, he's a badass boy.
Watch him slang in the lane with his candy red toy.
I bet you've never seen a throwed playa like him.
When we together we like Biggie and that girl Lil' Kim.
For every badass boy, there's a badass girl.
Hop in and let me take you on a trip to my world.
My name is Cookie, I've never been a rookie.

Lil' James.
UH OH Think fast here come Lil' James' badass.
Smashin the gas, smokin grass, playin on the Dreamcast.
Playin music to confuse but don't choose to blow my fuse.
Unless you want bad news cause I refuse to loose.
When I make my own rules, I'm grabbin my tools.
Wreckin crews with no clues, I'm a fool on the cool.
They stay on the mash, quick to tip right past.
Leave a splash, break them off showin nothin but ass.

I'm a badass nigga that's why they call me Big Tetta.
That's why I'm shakin up every puck, cause my Benz is better.
Man! I'm slidin past as I go.
Sippin on 40's, women tarin off my clothes.
Man! Lil' Flex, why they wanna plex?
Standin on the corner and holdin two tits.
Badass, badass little boy.
Badass, badass little boy.
Badass, badass little boy.
Who's bad?
