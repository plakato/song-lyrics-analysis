Bring It on Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.



Always had an eye for the boys.
Uhh Huh That's right.
Just about the time I thought I had it made.
I felt a slap on my shoulder.
Searching for her fortune and fame.
Don't you pretend you don't know.
Man she's got a way about her.
Man I always wanted to book that girl.
Don't you pretend you don't know.
Bring it on.
I said oh no Lord here we go.
Missy was a real fine looker.
Bring it on.

Bring it on, you can bring it on.
He said little man you best think this over.
I said, my my, oh can you look at them eyes.
Rumor says she from the bayou.
I've been waiting for it all night long.
Yeah baby.


Give it to me baby.
Bring it on.
She's driving all us poor boys insane.
Play around with some of her toys.
I said, my my, oh can you look at them eyes.
I said oh no Lord here we go.
To your rock n roll beat.
I know you got it in you to shake my sheets.
I turned around and had to stare up at him.
