All We Do Lyrics
by Yung Ralph.


Yeah.
Uh huh.
You know them boys by now.
Had to go get my juug brother on this one.
Yeah.
Le' go.

Yung Ralph w/ Young Scooter ad libs.
I be on the block, with them syrup sippers.
Them weed sellers, and them bird flippers.
I be on the block, with them syrup sippers.
Them weed sellers, and them bird flippers.
All we do is hustle, get that money, make it double.
All we do is hustle, get that money, make it double.
All we do is hustle, get that money, make it double.
All we do is hustle, get that money, make it double.

A thousand to two thousand grams, I doubled it.
You ain't talking money, that's irrelevant.
On Tuesday whip my dope up in the frying pan.
Just got a truck in, me and Juug Man.
I'm a paper chaser, he a money maker.
Really ain't no difference, we both 'bout that paper.
Ten toes down for them free bands.
Buy a brick you know you get two hundred extra grams.
Now every day I wake up, I see dollar signs.
You say you wanna shine, then stay on your grind.
Don't take a day off, hustle all the time.
I put wings on them bricks and let them birds fly.

I blowed a couple mil' on my last deal.
A hundred cash 'xact, I spent that on my last wheels.
I'm on the block serving half-a-pounds on the scooter.
Told my label I need an extra budget for my shooter.
Yeah, I fuck with Scooter, Black Amigo got them packs.
Walk in with the money, walk out with a sack.
VVS's on my body, yeah - free bands.
And all my bitches got cribs, a.k.a. free land.
Word on the street?  Juug Man back.
Got them pints of the lean, green, and the crack.
All this work, and I still ain't hiring?
All I do is juug, juug, juug, I'm thinking 'bout retiring, Ralph.
