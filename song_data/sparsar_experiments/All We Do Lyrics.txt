All We Do Lyrics
by Yung Ralph.


Yeah 
Uh, huh 
You, know them boys by now 
Had to go. Get my juug brother on this one 
Yeah 
Le' go 
 
, Yung, Ralph, w/, Young Scooter, ad libs 
I be on the block with them syrup, sippers, 
Them, weed sellers and them bird flippers 
I be on the block with them syrup, sippers, 
Them, weed sellers and them Bird flippers 
All we do is hustle, get that money make it double 
All we do is hustle. Get that money make it double 
All we do is hustle. Get that money make it double 
All we do is hustle get that money, make it double .
 
A thousand to two thousand grams: I doubled it. 
You ain't talking money, that's irrelevant, 
On, Tuesday whip. My dope up in the frying. Pan 
Just got a truck in me and Juug Man 
I'm a paper chaser. He a money maker, 
Really ain't, no difference. We both'bout that paper 
Ten toes down for them. Free bands, 
Buy a brick. You know you get two hundred extra grams 
Now every day I wake up. I see dollar signs. 
You say you wan na shine then stay on your grind. 
Don'T take a day off hustle. All the time 
I put wings on them bricks and let them birds fly 
, 
I blowed, a couple mil' on my last deal 
A hundred cash'xact. I spent that on my last wheels 
I'm on the block serving half-a-pounds on the scooter 
Told my label. I need an extra budget for my shooter 
Yeah. I fuck with Scooter Black Amigo got them packs 
Walk in with the money walk out with a sack 
VVS's on my body, yeah free bands 
And. All my bitches got cribs a.k.a. free land 
Word on the street, Juug Man back 
Got them pints of the lean green and the crack 
All. This work - and I still ain't hiring 
All I do - is juug juug juug, I'm thinking'bout retiring Ralph,
