Drinking & Driving (D.U.I) Lyrics
by Swazi Jive Entertainment.


Trust me, ain't nothing about.
That you don't know.
That you can't see.
Must be, everything about.
But you just want.
What I can't be.

I just been drinking and driving like crazy.
One day she love me the next day she hate me.
You tired of these girls that you hear from.
These boys have said anything.
You tired of these games they been playing but real is the only thing.
I'm just better than them.
Which is better than this.
Swear I don't like?

I just been drinking and driving like crazy.
One day she love me the next day she hate me.

You tired of these girls that you hear from.
These boys have said anything.
You tired of these games they been playing but real is the only thing.
I'm just better than them.
Which is better than this.
Swear I don't like?
