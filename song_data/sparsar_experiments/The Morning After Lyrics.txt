The Morning After Lyrics
by Zinc.


Well there's this feeling I get.
When i'm not feeling my best.
And there's nothing that can make it go away.
As I can't do just a little I get.
Stuck in the middle.
Of my own private groundhog day.

Even though i know that i'm gonna regret it all tomorrow.
I will let the sorrow fall where it may.
At least until.....

The morning after, the night before.
When I don't think that I could hate myself anymore.
Such a simple thing, yet I can't comprehend.
Why I keep making the same mistakes, over and over again.

Well this cell that I built.
For myself and my guilt.
Keeps me safe until my next escape.
And there's no use denying.
I'm in need of supplying.
I gotta get my hands on something I can take.

Even though I know I'm gonna regret it all tomorrow.
I will let the sorrow fall where it may.
At least until....

The morning after, the night before.
When I don't think I could hate myself anymore.
Such a simple thing, yet I can't comprehend.
Why I keep making the same mistakes,.
I will let the sorrow fall where it may.

All my sincere intent.
Ends up turning to lament.
Cause I don't know when it's time to stop.
At least until....

The morning after, the night before.
When I don't think I could hate myself anymore.
Such a simple thing, yet I can't comprehend.
Why I keep making the same mistakes, over and over again.

The morning after, the night before.
Why I keep making the same mistakes, over and over again.
The morning after, the night before.
