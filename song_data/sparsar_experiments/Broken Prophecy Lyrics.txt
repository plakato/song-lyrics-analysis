Broken Prophecy Lyrics
by Xavier.


It's been a long day, it's been a long day, it's been a long day.
And I'm blessed so I gotta thank God that I'm still alive.
I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid.
Of the steps that I gotta take to get to where I want in life.
Look inside the X you don't know.
Come into my home and see the seed that I had been sown, I want it to grow.
I want it to grow.
I want it to grow.

Damn it's so crazy.
I want it so bad as of lately.
Real life is hitting me.
Time will not wait for me.
I gotta make it work for myself.
It's good for my health.
These seeds are like greens to my diet and something I do not guard lightly.
whenever the drought is arriving.
Wanna be like the stars in the sky or something so big and so high.
Keep seeing some glimpses of my life late at night.
I won't stop short of the prize.
I won't stop short of the prize.
It's right in front of my eyes.
Lord tell me what I should do.
If you give me the gun imma shoot.
I won't stop short of the prize.
It's right in front of my eyes.
Imma go bust through the roof.
That's exactly what Imma go do.
That's exactly what Imma do.

I hope I was never told a Broken Prophecy.
