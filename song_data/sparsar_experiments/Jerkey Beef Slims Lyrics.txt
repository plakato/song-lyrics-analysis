Jerkey Beef Slims Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


Man, you all some mannequins dressed by society in a land of sin.
And everyone who's tapping in controls your fucking habits man.
Playing a mandolin or a piano man.
Impaled on a javelin through your ass and out your abdomen.
It's like The Happening but you still alive.
So over it to the point that I just wanted to die.
Until I got in a wreck and no one survived.
I'm pathogenic, don't you see that swirling in my eye?
My last amendment of this world is to be the man.
But what is the man with everybody thinking that they him?
You got to beat the man to be the man and we past the prelims.
I'll chew you fucks up, I love Jerkey Beef Slims.
Grab you by the face, grunt, and slam.
Facepalm to faceplant, damn.
Kidnap the Stans, concrete to feet.

Never to be found at the bottom of the lake.
Full throttle, what's a brake?
Kill doppels, one take, then bang bottles on your face.
Cause you watched it take place.
You a fraudulent fake, nothing more to say.
I'm going all out in this shit.
So give me crown, lick a dick.
Rip a pound, sniff a brick.
He's the hottest around, get with it.
He's sickened but slickened.
So he's pitching the bitches and he's afflicting your children.
He's a menace to your village, Agent Orange coming to pillage.
Leaving the blood splatters on the ceiling.
He's your classic fucking villain.
Making sure you know his face so everyone will try to kill him.
Infection spreading too quick for your petty amoxicillin.
Do you get it? I'ma jam it in your head bitch.
Like Mortal Kombat meeting Tekken.

I'm not to be messed with and can't be bested.
Cause I'm the best, kid.
Ty Infinite.
