Mike Jones Lyrics
by Swych.


I put on 
I said: We don't need no stinking badges, 
They know who we are and what we got in our bags's 
And. I just left the bank, so I come through laughing 
Shine so bright. I could cut through traffic now 
Everybody wan na talk about what he make 
But my iPhone got Flappy Bird, that's 3K on that eBay, 
3 Stacks of Benjamins, nickname, Andre 
So keep your pair of J's. I got me a pair of Beyonces 
All on my mouth like liquor, uh 
The whip lean like it's sipping on sizzurp 
I'm, A-Town, tizzurnt, H-Town, trizzill
, 
100 dollar, bizzills, 100 broads from Brazil. I'M a killa 
I turn heads snap, necks, baby, 
Young Peter Parker;
