Killin' Em' Off Lyrics
by Vizzi.


V-Raw check my whole kick game 
Vans on when you see out courtside at a Knicks game, 
Slice gang coming at your neck, like switchblade 
Legends on the rise. Your demise will be your mistake: 
YL young niggas, coming if you're fugay 
To your toupee banging on your neck. While we're in 2K 
So calm down you fucked up, you better hope. You luck up. 
Never need a yes man, but all these bitches suck up 
Young boy, never in no drama 
My hits go a couple. Commas. Your death or dishonor 
Young Stacks co-signer, loving my shit designer 
Jason Voorhees. I'M cutting your ass for nothing, 
Short-tempered flame, spitter, all ether, 
Smoking gun RIP, meet the reaper 
6 feet deep. That'S where your future lies inside 
The pyramid of lost souls, the all seeing eye 
 
Dope, all my shit dope 
All. My shit dope 
It be that 1-8-7, how I'm Killin Em Off 
All my shit dope. All my shit dope 
It be that 1-8-7, how I'm Killin Em Off 
 
Uhmmm uhmmm rum in the shrine
 
Pun in his prime. I runs in with
time 
I'm uhmm, something on other 
Never snuff, snuff, ya', bitch, booty, cuff cuff, a 
What's the wage, I'm on a different page, 
Plain folding different grade grain raw, a different age 
Not, intended for any sales to minors, 
You're looking too frail to sign a Plus 
The hot, I forgot to remind ya' 
It's, looking to bleak, to line up 
Look shoot. You lose 
Nah, nigga I'll shoot you snooze you'll, lose your life. 
Two rights, don't make a wrong. 
But you'll lose your whole face when it's gone. That'S a stake of knife
 
I'm hot: they not they cop or they rot. 
They, rot
