Killin' Em' Off Lyrics
by Vizzi.


V-Raw, check my whole kick game.
Vans on when you see out courtside at a Knicks game.
Slice gang, coming at your neck like switchblade.
Legends on the rise, your demise will be your mistake.
YL, young niggas coming if you're fugay.
To your toupee, banging on your neck while we're in 2K.
So calm down, you fucked up, you better hope you luck up.
Never need a yes man but all these bitches suck up.
Young boy, never in no drama.
My hits go a couple commas, your death or dishonor.
Young Stacks co-signer, loving my shit designer.
Jason Voorhees, I'm cutting your ass for nothing.
Short-tempered, flame spitter, all ether.
Smoking gun, RIP, meet the reaper.
6 feet deep, that's where your future lies inside.
The pyramid of lost souls, the all seeing eye.

Dope, all my shit dope.
All my shit dope.
It be that 1-8-7 how I'm Killin Em Off.
All my shit dope, all my shit dope.
It be that 1-8-7 how I'm Killin Em Off.

Uhmmm, uhmmm,, rum in the shrine.

Pun in his prime,, I runs in with.
time.
I'm, uhmm, something on other.
Never snuff, snuff ya' bitch, booty cuff, cuff a.
What's the wage? I'm on a different page.
Plain folding, different grade, grain, raw, a different age.
Not intended for any sales to minors.
You're looking too frail to sign a plus.
The  hot, I forgot to remind ya'.
It's looking to bleak to line up.
Look, shoot, you lose.
Nah nigga, I'll shoot, you snooze, you'll lose your life.
Two rights don't make a wrong.
But you'll lose your whole face when it's gone, that's a stake of knife.

I'm hot, they not, they cop, or they rot.
They rot!!
