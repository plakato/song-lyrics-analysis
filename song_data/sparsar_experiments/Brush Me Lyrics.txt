Yeah ya know.
Nah nah no.

I'm not about to, do round two but I found you.
You move with the moon, I make you howl too.

Romantic man girl despite what you heard.
Pop the champagne, girl your body a murder.

Wickedest kind of loving you forget what you deserve I got the sweet spot for.

Yeah, maybe the timing is off.
Maybe a new watch ain't it.
Maybe I need to buy me a clock.
So I can rewind.
