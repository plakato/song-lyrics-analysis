Winter Walls Lyrics
by XamVolo.


Got that peripheral vision on.
Watching the roads that I've ridden on.
Gotta watch my back, If I don't see who follows.
I won't see tomorrow - It's just like that.
Gotta watch out for the cracks, and the wolf packs.
Black-on-black, Kings and the Jacks, with the spades and the clubs.
Guns and the bats, all on blast.
And they're high off lies; Fireflies; full-on ignorant.
Why do we bother with these idiots?
Too many Herod's up in here.
They've been hating since I's a baby now.
I don't need a warning about this danger I was born in.
Now why is my soul roaring?
And why's it so important?

It's not like you weren't told.
It gets mighty, mighty cold.
Past those winter walls...

I know, I know, I know.
I've seen this before.
This ain't de-ja-vu, days are.
Getting short, no lie.
And there's so much you can do in a lifetime.
And there's no such thing as a right time, so I move.
In a full white suit, like I'm finna fly to the moon.
Fully ignorant, lying with belligerents, oh.
Too many Herod's up in here.
They've been hating since I's a baby now.
I don't need a warning about this soul I was born with.
Why is my soul roaring?
And why's it so important?

It's not like you weren't told.
It gets mighty, mighty cold.
Past those winter walls...

Everyday people they come and go.
Everyday people they wanna go where there's solid gold.
Everyday people you better know I'm not one-o-those.
Looking at life through tinted rose.
Looking at life like it decides:.
Right, this is as far as you're gonna go.
Stuck in a job on the pay role.
Of some A-hole, with a worse chance of advance than licking your elbow.
Like hell no, Like they'll know what you could do if you're exposed...
If I were you, I'd grab a coat.

It's not like you weren't told.
It gets mighty, mighty cold.
Past those winter walls...
