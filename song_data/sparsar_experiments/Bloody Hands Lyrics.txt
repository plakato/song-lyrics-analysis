Bloody Hands Lyrics
by X Blake Freeman X.


You're so damn famous to all of my fans.
I've bragged about you as much I can.
On Facebook,.
Twitter, and Omegle.
webcams.
I wanted the world to know that's always been my plan.
You're perfect and that can't be left a secret.
And everything misses you if you decide to leave it.
Those cat eyes and that red hair I used to love seein'.
And people seein' us in every buildin' we'd be in.

We were so dang perfect in my honest opinion.
Almost a year later still haven't lost them feelins'.
Time for me has never healed, healed are secret dealins'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.

I still stop by that coffee shop whenever I'm around.
I still look for those red locks whenever I'm in town.
I still listen for that sweet voice, that only perfect sound.
I been lookin' for you baby but you're nowhere to be found.
I was told time heals all wounds and it always gets better.
Well why am I still heart broken wishing we could be together.
I love you, you love me, and soon age won't mean a thing.
I'm still countin' down the days until I see you're 18.

We were so dang perfect in my honest opinion.
Almost a year later still haven't lost them feelins'.
Time for me has never healed, healed are secret dealins'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.

Break Down.
Oh my God.
Oh my God how.
Oh my God.
Oh my God how.
Could they keep me away from you.
Could they keep you away from me.

We were so dang perfect in my honest opinion.
Almost a year later still haven't lost them feelins'.
Time for me has never healed, healed are secret dealins'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
From the hearts that we were stealin'.
We must have bloody hands from the hearts that we were stealin'.
