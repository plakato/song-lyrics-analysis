Lachesis Lyrics
by Bodi.


You rise, then you fall 
You fly till you crawl 
And. You can't stand on your own two 
Unless somebody holds you up. 
So, give up 
So, give up 
 
Think of jumping overboard cause life, has given no accord 
Sink and slice and cut the cord and sever ties with what you stored. 
And you adored and move on toward the edge is just a little more 
What you holding on there for the waves can take you from the shore 
Say, no more, let the gray overtake you 
You always knew one day. This would break you 
What you waiting for a thank you Move on 
No one ever cared and no one will when you're gone. 
This is long overdue. 
Said you'd always be here, but who you trying to fool. 
You can see the writing on the wall. Speaking tongues. 
How much longer, can you go with those old creaking lungs 
Walk toward the sun evaporate with the wind 
Your work here is done. Stubborn little emo kid 
The world will go on without you, it'll be lighter. 
And have one less preacher to the choir 
Blowing smoke from your funeral pyre 
Maybe that'll, finally, lift some wings. A little higher 
The end is here to stay, maybe not what you desired. 
But shh…close, your eyes.. You look a little tired, 
 
And. What have you done? 
What kind of man have you become 
What? Have you done 
What kind of man? Have you become 
And? You can try to run away 
But. The devils that you face won't fade. Yeah 
You can try to run away. 
But they'll all catch up with you. Some way. 
You'Ve got to make a change
