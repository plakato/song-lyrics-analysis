Lachesis Lyrics
by Bodi.


You rise then you fall.
You fly till you crawl.
And you can't stand on your own two.
Unless somebody holds you up.
So give up.
So give up.

Think of jumping overboard cause life has given no accord.
Sink and slice and cut the cord and sever ties with what you stored.
And you adored and move on toward the edge is just a little more.
What you holding on there for the waves can take you from the shore.
Say no more, let the gray overtake you.
You always knew one day this would break you.
What you waiting for, a thank you? Move on.
No one ever cared, and no one will when you're gone.
This is long overdue.
Said you'd always be here, but who you trying to fool?
You can see the writing on the wall speaking tongues.
How much longer can you go with those old creaking lungs?
Walk toward the sun, evaporate with the wind.
Your work here is done stubborn little emo kid.
The world will go on, without you, it'll be lighter.
And have one less preacher to the choir.
Blowing smoke from your funeral pyre.
Maybe that'll finally lift some wings a little higher.
The end is here to stay, maybe not what you desired.
But shh…close your eyes. You look a little tired.

And what have you done?
What kind of man have you become?
What have you done?
What kind of man have you become?
And you can try to run away.
But the devils that you face won't fade, yeah.
You can try to run away.
But they'll all catch up with you some way.
You've got to make a change.
