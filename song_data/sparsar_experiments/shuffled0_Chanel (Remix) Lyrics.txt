Chanel (Remix) Lyrics
by NuLOVE.

I know you're better that.
And when I see you at school.
See I'm not looking for love, I just want to give some advice.
Instead I hit a party, they smoking, drinking for certain.
And turn the music up, cause she only wants to dance.
You get it in or get it on, you getting left, you get it right?
Thinking that I'm in love, that'll prolly change in the AM.
But I guess its true, only time can change ya.
Everybody hold your drinks up.
Damn, that's not how your momma raised ya.
Procrastinating on essays I got to turn in.
This little tie we have, I'm severing that.
You fall in love with all the ones, you never thought you'd ever like.
By the end of the night, she'll probably throw her drink up.
Just another sloppy teen, but hey.
Do it cause there's tension all throughout your life and now.
You just want to get away, so come here and take these shots with me.
How could I blame them? Your body's banging, you look amazing.
Do you do it for attention? You tried to tell them that you only.
Nah, thought you would be better than that.
Sitting with this girl, she's confessing that she's a virgin.
These niggas would do anything to get you out your pants.
Thought you would be better than that.
You drowning in the alcohol you snoozing with the fishes.
And you don't remember shit, how could your heart forget?
You just putting up them walls like an architect.
They don't know how your life is behind the scenes.
All that crying, they saying that you're a drama queen.
Spill enough emotions to probably fill your sink up.
If you're in so much pain, why continue living that life?
And she just wants to drink up, somebody fill her drink up.
Swallowing all that pink stuff, puffing on all that green stuff.
Well I don't really know, but I thought you would be better than that.
Cupid got precision, he shooting where he wishes.
You gon' be looking at me like everything is so cool.
Cause I don't want to make your life worse than it is.
