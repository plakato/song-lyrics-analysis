Belly of the Beast Lyrics
by Sway.

Woman's voice.
Bobby.. Bobby.. Bobby.. Digital.. Digital.. Digital...
Bobby.. Bobby.. Bobby.. Digital.. Digital.. Digital...

Bobby Digital.
{*makes that DOODOODOODOO noise over woman's voice*}.
Bobby Bobby.. yo...
Belly of the beast, belly of the beast.
Yo, yo.

The murderous assault catapault lyrics from the vault.
The exalted chief annointed, flows double jointed.
Ointment of disappointment, opponents can't pinpoint it.
The moment of microphone mystics, merciless meticulous.

Expose those who real and whose nervous.
I'm killin your urges, I'm determined.
To inject my serum, to your eardrums.
Then swell them up, it's the merciless.
Galactic tactics, of microphone harassment.
Impregnates your brain to give your head piece contractions.
Rebirth the thought, Wu-Tang can't be played short.
We import and export, uncut dope from New York.
Like Nate who sold weight, between Monroe and Gates.
Half-ounce to big cake slice to his lowest price rate.
Had a deathcase at the weekend when his cousin used to freebase.
A high speed chase and Gods waved in his face.

B-O-B-B-Y.
Trapped up inside the belly of the beast got to break loose.
Bobby unleashes, the craziest shit.
Fuck the world fuck the peace it's...
B-O-B-B-Y.
Trapped up in the belly of beast, we gotta break loose.
Bobby unleashes, fuck the bloodshed.
Yo slugs to your head, you won't make it past me.

Hell.. I'm gettin sick.
I bugged the fuck out when DMX fucked Taral Hicks.
Make me wanna jerk my dick, jerk jerk jerk...
Jerk jerk, and bust the fuck off on the next ho's skirt.
E.M.I., I'm wild like G.I., Joe - Magnum P.I.
Or niggas from C.I., on the B drinkin Knee-High.
Alpha Phi, Sigma guy, NeoGeo, fuck the C.O. or the P.O.
I'm wild like the Lion Leo.
It's a K.O. fuck a J-O.. B.
I'm an emcee, D-M-D, W-T-C, B-C, G-P, REC posse's all in me.
Live on TV.. you see the B.. O-B-B.. Y.. D-I.. G-I.. T.. A-L.
Can never go to jail by NY..PD.
F.I.C, try to hold my money hostage.
From my last deposit was one mill'.
Bobby Steels gettin ill.

Still, trapped up in the belly of the beast.
Fuck the world, fuck the beast.
Bobby unleashes, masterpieces.
When I'm trapped in the belly of the beast.
And bring the war, and say fuck the beast!
What should I do?
{*makes that DOODOODOODOO noise*}.
