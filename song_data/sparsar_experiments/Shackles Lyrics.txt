Shackles Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

I hear Shackles.
Coming through the door.
I hear Shackles.
Draggin cross the floor.
I'm in the kitchen.
But I ain't gonna run.
Lookout Shackles.
I got a gun.
I got a fun.
I hear Shackles.
Creepin down the halls.
I hear Shackles.
Rattling the walls.
Well I lay here.
No I don't make a peep, no.
Good luck Shackles.
Latching on to me.
Latching on to me.
Cause I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man.
Well I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man.
I hate those Shackles.
Gonna kill em off tonight.
Gonna cut those Shackles.
Gonna cut em with my knife.
Well it's time, time to say goodbye.
Cause tonight Shackles.
You're gonna die.
