Against All Odds Lyrics
by Swollen Members.

Against all odds I worship galvanized gods.
Saturn sends serpents hatch from underworld cause.
Disguised as associates but I can recognise fraud.
Head and nose Brewing brutal hesitant to applaud.
I been known to fall flat in my face covered in mud.
As the sun turns to darkness the moon turns to blood.
Love turns to hate  revenge turns to guilt.
I thrive on complements as my confidence is built.
Feel the need to abort as assassins extort.
My mind frame contort tryin to hold down the fort.
Fort knocks despise clocks heart bleeds I plant seeds.
Guaranteed my first son, a descendent of a legend.
I'm edging towards falling off the face of this earth.
Chemical in valets of anger at planted at birth.
Hereditary faults more mans complex assaults.
And battery and flattery feeds the flame catapults.

The odds are against me.
The odds are against me.
The odds are against me.
There's no chance for this champ.

Cold-blooded carnivore.
Crush skulls like rancour.
Thanks tarnish red.
Northwest extraterrestrial.
Endangered species.
Stole the rams head from skellitore.
Predator in a powerful assault stand and manse.
A pain from conformity drink from the jugular.
Emasculate brain cells bomb loads of regular.
Equipped with the hatchet attachment I slay.
Break bones and like snap necks like Chun Li with a krumatie.
Full contact tracks cracks and amplified cramps.
Furious fists flown by the welterweight champ.
Vampire and hell fire fuck around and get burned.
I'm a deputised regulator courts adjourned.
Surrealism laced with enthusiasm.
My molecular structure separates your cytoplasm.
Muscle spasms increase into uncontrollable knots.
Bandits ambushes you and rides my train of thought.
Discipline disciples militant massacre.
Molesting mediocrity.
That's what were down for.
Brainstorm then transformed into an abnormal down fall.
Psychopathic psychlone an F-5 twister.
Call me mr heat minor I charge the energiser.
Run by solar power deviants I devour.

The odds are against me.
The odds are against me.
Definitely against me.
No fuckin chance.

Mad miraculous.
Dominate potency.
It's wonderful smashing impotent mutants.
Shootin junk into your veins painful poisonous venom.
In every drug body shrugs and laughs when I get in em.
Special effects flashbacks are beneficial.
Crystal mad deep breath is artificial.
Fate intension it releases your species decreases.
I lost my marbles, my brains a puzzle with missin pieces.
The light is flickerin up stares die alone no one cares.
A couple sandwiches short of a picnic.
I'm just kickin it.
Sickening kinetically chaotic feel the poetic mastermind blastin by.
Barbarian's barricades artillery ambushed.
Awkward ammunition trembling trolls.

Golden fish wish as they once surrounded by piranhas on a mission.
Enter the vicious circle a mind-bending action.
A magnificent tournament passing out obvious obstacles.
That hangs like ornaments.
Then brainwashing and reconstructing thoughts like psychology.
Articulate aggression, technical terminology.
Suffer the consequences of excruciating pain.
Absorb ten thousand volts of madness to your brain.
Combat the crusader annihilate violators.
I'm a strategic and dangerous catapulting culprit.

The odds are against me.
The odds are against me.
His chances are slim.
The odds are against me.
Hey what's the fuck wrong with him?
