Black and yellow diamonds Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Black and yellow diamonds around my wrists be shining bright when i walk the.
streets of nyc trap partys stay live at night day time makes moves so quick u.
dont even see right im so computer smart no edcation needed over here i open.
them up they see me lovely we murder for fun stay fly to death never rich stay.
poor rich gets robbed everyday time is nonstop over here books and trees stay.
new like sneakers money stay dirty for life club full of hot girls they stay.
pretty for us.
