Bear Cat Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

You know what you said about me, don't you woman....
Well, you ain't nothin' but a bear cat.
Been scratchin' at my door.
You ain't nothin' but a bear cat.
Been scratchin' at my door.
You can purr pretty kitty.
But I ain't gonna rub you no more.
You said you was a long-hair.
But I can see through that.
You said you was a long-hair.
But I can see through that.
And mama I know.
You're just an old bear cat.
You ain't nothin' but a bear cat.
Been scratchin' at my door.
Ain't nothin' but a bear cat.
You been scratchin' at my door.
You can purr pretty kitty.
But I ain't gonna rub you no more.
Whoa, rub you!
Whoa, git with it now.
Git it, git it, git it, git it!
Oh, listen to that old cat.

Oh, tip it miss kitty.
Tip it honey, tip it!
Hey!
I'm tellin' you honey....
You made me feel so mean.
Made me moan and groan.
You made me feel so mean.
You made me moan and groan.
You ain't wantin' no man.
You're just lookin' for an old soup bone.
You ain't nothin' but a bear cat.
Been scratchin' at my door.
You're just an old bear cat.
Been scratchin' at my door.
You can purr pretty kitty.
But I ain't gonna rub you no more.
Meow, meow.
