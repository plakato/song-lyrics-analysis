Bear Cat Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

You know what you said about me: don't you, woman, ... 
Well, you ain't nothin', but a bear cat
Been scratchin' at my door
You ain't nothin', but a bear cat
Been scratchin' at my door
You can purr pretty kitty
But. I ain't gon na rub you no more
You said you was a long-hair
But I can see through that
You said you was a long-hair
But I can see through that
And mama. I know
You're just an old bear: cat
You ain't nothin', but a bear cat
Been scratchin' at my door
Ain't nothin', but a bear cat
You been scratchin' at my door
You. Can purr pretty kitty
But. I ain't gon na rub you no more
Whoa, rub you 
Whoa git with it now
Git it git it git it git it 
Oh! Listen to that old, cat

Oh tip it miss kitty
Tip, it honey tip it 
Hey, 
I'm tellin', you, honey, ..., 
You made me feel so. Mean
Made me, moan and groan
You made me feel so. Mean
You made me moan and groan
You ain't wantin', no man
You're, just lookin' for an old soup. Bone
You ain't nothin', but a bear cat
Been scratchin' at my door
You're, just an old bear. Cat
Been scratchin' at my door
You can purr pretty kitty
But. I ain't gon na rub you no more
Meow meow
