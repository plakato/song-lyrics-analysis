Acquisitions Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


Just tryin' get it just tryin', get it 
Nigga. What up tho Chicago, ATL, 
You already know 
 
Ridin' round tryin' get it. I'M just tryin', get it 
If ya: ain't tryin' get it! I ain't fuckin' witcha 
I got ta, keep it trill, that's just how I'm livin' 
If you ain't fuck wit me then I'ont feel no different. 
I'M ridin' in the latest feelin' like the greatest 
I'm ridin' in my city, feelin' like the mayor, 
I'm ridin' on you niggas. If I catch you, hatin' 
I'm ridin' on you niggas. If you try to play me, 
 
Quentin Miller, switchin' flow up, make it different. 
Labels turn their back on me. It didn't make a difference. 
I'M bout, peace but nigga I be tryin', make a killin' 
No. One gave a shit for me so fuck these haters feelings, 
Damn its a cruel world, 
Bands a get me that new benz and a new girl 
Shit. Let get it then damn how you do it to em' 
They ain't think I stood a chance. I had to prove it to em' 
Okay lets get it then 
Big bank over owl tank lil bank sip, drank 
Till. I fall, then we sip again 
Quentin Miller, I'ma ball. Just like Reggie did 
Quentin Miller bitch, I'm everything you never been 
 
Ridin' round, tryin' get it. I'M just tryin', get it 
If ya ain't tryin' get it! I ain't fuckin' witcha 
I got ta, keep it trill, that's just how I'm livin' 
If you ain't fuck wit. Me then I'ont feel no different 
I'm ridin' in the latest feelin' like the greatest 
I'm ridin' in my city, feelin' like the mayor, 
I'm ridin' on you niggas. If I catch you, hatin' 
I'm ridin' on you niggas. If you try to play me
