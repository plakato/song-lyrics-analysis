Acquisitions Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


Just tryin' get it, just tryin' get it.
Nigga what up tho? Chicago, ATL.
You already know.

Ridin' round tryin' get it, I'm just tryin' get it.
If ya ain't tryin' get it, I ain't fuckin' witcha.
I gotta keep it trill, that's just how I'm livin'.
If you ain't fuck wit me then I'ont feel no different.
I'm ridin' in the latest feelin' like the greatest.
I'm ridin' in my city feelin' like the mayor.
I'm ridin' on you niggas if I catch you hatin'.
I'm ridin' on you niggas if you try to play me.

Quentin Miller, switchin' flow up make it different.
Labels turn their back on me it didn't make a difference.
I'm bout peace but nigga I be tryin' make a killin'.
No one gave a shit for me so fuck these haters feelings.
Damn, its a cruel world.
Bands a get me that new benz and a new girl.
Shit let get it then, damn how you do it to em'.
They ain't think I stood a chance I had to prove it to em'.
Okay lets get it then.
Big bank over owl tank, lil bank sip drank.
Till I fall then we sip again.
Quentin Miller, I'ma ball just like Reggie did.
Quentin Miller, bitch I'm everything you never been.

Ridin' round tryin' get it, I'm just tryin' get it.
If ya ain't tryin' get it, I ain't fuckin' witcha.
I gotta keep it trill, that's just how I'm livin'.
If you ain't fuck wit me then I'ont feel no different.
I'm ridin' in the latest feelin' like the greatest.
I'm ridin' in my city feelin' like the mayor.
I'm ridin' on you niggas if I catch you hatin'.
I'm ridin' on you niggas if you try to play me.
