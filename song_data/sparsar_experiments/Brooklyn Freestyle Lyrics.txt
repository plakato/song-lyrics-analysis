Brooklyn Freestyle Lyrics

Yea.
C'mon.
Yea.
Got some shit on my chest.
Yea.
Alright.

I been livin off delusion.
Cuz I heard its healthy.
Pockets growing.
Labels talkin.
Hoes been far from stealthy.
I'm still slightly flyin under radars.
I practice like its playoffs.
I lay brick a day I'm out here tryna build the Great Wall of yours truly.
I need more groupies.
And less people tryna get a cut.
Put your fuckin hands back in your pockets.
Man you said enough.
Conversation over.
Lately I've been celebrating.
Hardly ever sober.
True squad generals.
No room for soldiers.
I gotta classic debut right here chillin in my holster.
My shoulders got the weight of my world on them.
And her world.
And his world.
And your world on them.
I need a Venezuelan.
Or my Afghani chick from dc.
To come fuck with my campaign.
And treat me presidential.
Leave the politics at home, strictly Lewinsky.
Then it's back to trying to get a buzz like 50.
Cup full of whisky just to level out.
I only keep kings around me sacramento style.
You need to elevate your life, you've been living lateral.
Get you a passion put some dream in a catapult.
Being broke in America is unnatural.
I'm just giving you facts.
You start giving ideas.
They start giving you cash.
You start popping a little.
They start giving you daps.

But I'm not mad at the slightest, the public praises you for what you practice.
in private.
You've been cordially invited.
To my showing out party.
Reminds me of LA when we had cases of Bacardi, jars of marijuana.
Rooftop was the lobby, too young for that money so the girls got wobbly.
They want the whole crew like motley.
That was right before 21.
I've been fucking the world I'm 'bout to make the money come.
Fuck what y'all got.
And y'all squares time is up.
Because I watched you let the ball drop.
1 too many times.
I've been hiding out in Brooklyn.
I got too comfortable, I had to re arrange the cushions.
Get in touch with my chakras.
Papa just died, I feel in love with some vodka.
Fell out with the ex, then back in love with some vodka.
My half brother Jimmy showed up at the wake.
Haven't seen him since '97 what the fuck do I say!
He's got some baby mama issues.
Shit's been ugly.
She's trying to take him down, raising money with Go Fund Me.
Damn, on top of that, heroin that took my best friend.
He hits me up to blow L's.
But I'm just trying to catch M's.
Hoes coming out the wood works, they see ya boy building so they trying to get.
this wood work.
And if you tan with an accent, uhhhhhhhh.

Yup!
