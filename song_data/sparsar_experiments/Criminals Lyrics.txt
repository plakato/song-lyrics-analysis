Criminals Lyrics
by Annie Mell Monroe.

Criminals; they say that's who we are.
We get shot on the block just for spitting some rhymes.
Nigga, words really do have a meaning.
And drugs have a way to evoke a new feeling.
.
So judge me for being who I want to be.
Right from Manhattan, dressed in Supreme.
So yeah I got purp haze and I got cream.
So please shut the fuck up, get off my dick.
.
Perez said Get them so I got them.
And now I got steeze and they're all aplauding.
Put me on a stage I re position all my rage.
Liberating every single note been ever caged.
.
Can not handle half of me.
.
Wishing for a day I'm finding bigger checks.
So come between me and my future and you're absurd.
I'm the biggest motherfucker since Pharrell to hit the page.
And I am never going to hold my tongue for shit.
.
Cause I don't talk shit.
And I spit fresh.
And I blow dank.
Color the canvas in my mind with beautiful pictures.
Who dropped a new beat nigga that's mine.
.
Dressing the haze in a french cigar.
Don't want to stay here so I'm flying off.
Phisycs is phisycs but fuck gravity.
Got a blunt and a label and I'm taking lead.
.
And I'm doing me while you sit on your ass.
With Luanne by my side sitting in the first class.
Land in New York, drink syrup get throwed.
Call my dudes up, but I'm moving kind of slow.
.
And it's no problem how I rock that stage.
Set a record better flip the yellow page.
Everybody on the street who knows me wants to fuck me so they can all have my.
last name.
Goddamn.
.
Chill motherfucker.
The ladies on the streets know I'm trill motherfucker.
And I work for the money, get bills motherfucker.
Hip hop is dead but I'm real motherfucker.
.
