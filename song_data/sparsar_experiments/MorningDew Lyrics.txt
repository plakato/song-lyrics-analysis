MorningDew Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


They see me doin' me and they get so inspirated.
Bitch you know me, I ain't worried 'bout who hatin'.
Smokin' seaweed, man, now I sit adjacent.
Fallin' jewels jinglin' hanging from me while a ranger.
Posted, no clip, just peace in my holster.
Plan B, pull the blade on him, now he hold up.
Grow up, I ain't Sosa but I still made her glow up.
Thunder man, tundra boy, cold like Dakota.

Young and I'm gorgeous, the flow fuckin' flawless.
I know that talk is cheap, but from me you can't afford it.
Drugs in my cauldron, mixin' up the potion.
Young white witch in the Styx, just flowin'.
Creepin' like I'm Voldo, posted in the corridor.
Gimme the light like Sean Paul, smokin' like I'm on parole.
I said, Stop, you lyin', you actin' like you grind.
You flexin' in them Benzes, but them bitches still parked.
Hope your momma ain't around to see her son be nothin'.
Hope you know nobody 'round when you say you stuntin'.
No mask, no axe, just a blade on my lap.
Birdbaths in the back let you know it's like that.
Green grass, white stone, got a pool in my room.
Diving board made of diamonds, shining while I'm in my tomb.
No Rolex, no, give a fuck about the time.
Cause no matter what they say, I know I'll always be mine.
