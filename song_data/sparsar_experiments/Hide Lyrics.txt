Hide Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.

We're in a room full of people.
And you're talking to yourself again.
'Til you find your closest friend, the door.

Let's take a walk out in the sun.
You said, Why? The clouds will come.
Just like all the times before.

Well, how can you survive.
On whiskey and goodbyes.
Does it satisfy?

Baby, don't go off and hide.
So scared of what the world will find.
I can help you if you need it.

You may not care for love.
You made it clear, you're mind's made up.
I can make your heart believe it.

It will take your breath away.
Just try, you'll be amazed.
It'll bring new life to the dead.

You just know without any proof.
It can turn lies into truth.
It's the best medicine you can get.

Won't you take my hand.
Before you slip back there.
And get nowhere?

Baby, don't go off and hide.
So scared of what the world will find.
I can help you if you need it.

You may not care for love.
You made it clear, you're mind's made up.
I can make your heart believe it.
Oh, make your heart believe it.

I can't watch you drown, drown.
Sink to the bottom like a stone.
So unaware that you're even going down, down.
You do it oh so naturally.

Don't go off and hide.
So scared of what the world will find.
I can help you if you need it.

Oh, you may not care for love.
You made it clear, you're mind's made up.
I can make your heart believe it.
I can help you if you need it.

Let's take a walk out in the sun.
I know the clouds will come.
But not like before.
