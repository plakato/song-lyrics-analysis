Journey Lyrics
by Woodie.

A-Wax.
Yo feel my flury.
Feel my fury.
Middle finger to the world.
Till I'm burried.
Heaven or hell.
Choose one or be a treat.
By seven I'm in a spell, bumpin' a beat.
Somethin' comes from deep within me.
Talkin' sickly, stictly, talkin' to me.
So possibly I could be goin' insane.
Snortin' this cane.
Stressed out like a muthafucka flowin' his pain.
Misunderstood by most.
Few people considered close.
It's a very thin line between foes and folks.
Slide up ? and spokes, bangin' the curb.
Stumblin' out the driver side tamin' the Burg.
Mumblin' words, ready to reach.
Dawg I'm deadly wit heat.
Hold it steady I'll be.
A fuckin' nut, patna what.
Run up and get touched.
Sent him on a journey stretched out on a gurney.
I'm turnin' more savage as the days go by.
Think I'm headed for the flames.
Dawg, I ain't gon' lie.
It's a cold world full a sin.
What the fuck, what the fuck.
What the fuck are you supposed to do.
They after you and they want yo soul.
But it ain't nothin' you can do.
Wit that chrome 44.
All the love in the world couldn't kill this rage.
And I simply love nothin' but this kill I blaze.

Let me take you on a journey.
Heaven to the depths of hell burning.
Westcoast to eastcoast where we makin' earnings.
America, we ain't scared of ya we darin' ya.
Better be prepared when you hit the Bay Area.
Journey, heaven to the depths of hell burning.
Westcoast to eastcoast where we makin' earnings.
America, we ain't scared of ya we darin' ya.
Better be prepared when you hit the Bay Area.

Woodie.
That's the point ya existance.
I could feel these haters in a distance.
Plottin', schemin', dreamin' that they can get wit this.
Witness through the eyes of a survivor.
From these battlefields in the streets.
I was born a fighter.
And unlike many others.
I've been through this shit.
I've held a homie's hand.
Till he died and lost grip.
Homie rip, rest in peace.
Things we used to say but fuck that!
That ain't enough I'm gonna ride to my grave.
Think I'm gonna pay for the actions that you make.
I'm way beyond the point of wonder why I'm ? trait.
This goes to all my enemies.
Big or small, your up in the fault.
I got nothin' to loose.
I die or win it all.
Look my mind is like a brick wall.
Hard to penetrate.
This stuborn muthafucka that I am is ready to demonstrate.
You tend to fake.
Sucka you'll be the first to go.
Cuz I'm a lay it down, right now.
Woodie let ya know.
