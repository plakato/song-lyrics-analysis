The Truth (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Yung F.L.Y.


*JaySo mimics the sample*.
They call me Jayso.
Be like, Yung Fly, Ebe like we made Tasha Proud.
Ugh Yeah.
YÎµ ma rap music Akwaaba.

I just dropped a bomb, you lighting stoves?
Let your lines out while I explode.
My steeze mad heavy like Iron chains.
I heard the truth hurts. I'm in pain.
Skills legit, no federal issues.
Just did a hit, you committed a miscue.
Skillions folk just went official.
I heard your clique's broke, let me fix you.
It ain't nothing to me, delivering new beats.
Chilling on cloud nine, haters wan push me.
I'm too busy to look, change coming in.
Counting papers, greens, I'm turning a new leaf.
Your lyrics is too weak, mine's Goliath.
Call me RL Stein, a ghost writer.
Flow rider like surfers.
Bring the Fire Service.
When I speak to the beat, ya heard this?
Money ain't a thing.
My wealth is in Heaven, so said the Reverend.
The Oldest Lesson; You reap what you planted.
Eat cos you earned it, or face the fire from the furnace.
Don't hate, I'm just proving a point.
Doing the very joints that wouldn't coin.
But it's ok, we taking it out of here.
GH international rap pioneers.
So don't be surprised when you see me one day.
Cutting greens like doing lawns.
E no be say I do sakawa.
God wey e bless me give me Sharp head like Unicorns.
I'm just an operator, God-First.
My word's mathematical, verbally drop motivational, hot verbs.
I swerve you non-dreamers, sleep killers.
Call me sub-woofer, I'm a deep speaker.
O My!

We did this for the love rap music.
Watch out for the second single.
Watch out for the Album.
Jayso! Peace!
