Care Of Cell Lyrics
by The Zombies.

Good morning to you, I hope your feeling better baby.
Thinkin of me while you are far away.
Counting the days until they set you free again.
Writing this letter, hoping your okay.
Sent to the room you used to stay in every Sunday.
The one that is warmed by sunshine everyday.
And we'll get to know each other for a second time.
Then you can tell me about your prison stay.

Feels so good your coming home soon.

Its gonna be good to have you back again with me.
Watching the laughter play around your eyes.
Come up and getcha, saved up for the train fare money.
Kiss and make-up and it will be so nice.

Feels so good your coming home soon.

Walkin the way we used to walk.
And it could be so nice.
Talkin the way we used to talk.
And it could be so nice.

Its gonna be nice to have you back again with me.
Watching the laughter play around your eyes.
Come up and getcha, saved up for the train fare money.
Kiss and make-up and it will be so nice.

Feels so good your coming home soon.

Feels so good your coming home soon.
