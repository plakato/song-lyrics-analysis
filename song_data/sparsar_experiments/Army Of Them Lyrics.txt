Army Of Them Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

He starts collecting.
Memories.
His mind develops.
Strategies.

The path is set.
It's time for their revenge.
He leads the army of them.
Towards the end of all, of all.

Irresistable force.
Irresistable beauty.

He can't help it.
He's infected by us.
He can't help it.
His life begins right now.
