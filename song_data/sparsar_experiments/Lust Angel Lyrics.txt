Lust Angel Lyrics
by NuLOVE.


I heard your momma barely ever let you out the house.
But now that you're finally of age theres no more round-a-bouts.
You swore you'd make up for every single party you missed.
Sip Bacardi, throwing dollars, you gon' probably strip.
Damn, thats how that shit go. Girl you walk around this bitch.
Acting like a misfit looking for a strip pole.
We play Russian Roulette with sex pistols.
You about to call up your ex and get thrizzowed.
You can have whatever you want, I won't tell nobody if you won't.
I promise you a substitute will do the kama sutra that you don't.
Are you down to go? Its up to you.
Lying that we loving you, but lord knows that you bluffin too.
And we puffin too. My memory prolly won't be restored.
Throw back a couple of shots but  really there's no need to keep a score.
I thought you had a halo but I can see your horns.
The moment that you take'em off is when you'll be ignored.
Damn, thats how that shit go. Girl you walk around this bitch.
Acting like a misfit looking for a strip hole..
You play Russian Roulette with sex pistols.
Whenever you through with that sex you get disowned.

Seventeen, lit candles on that birthday cake.
From your parents, but instead you drinking liquor with niggas.
And that's cool, I'm just hoping that they're using protection.
For your sake, just think; Do you know who the F that they're F'ing?
But whatever, cause I'm having a goodtime, listen.
I don't know about that train shit, that pussy is wreckage.

With that blue dream inside it, but you ain't touching my weed.
Girl you a Vixen, Santa deer on Christmas.
Every time that come around, you on a niggas wishlist I'm serious.
But  you're delusional. Thinking you, the wifey type.
Nevermind, just give me top while I'm getting high as a satellite.
