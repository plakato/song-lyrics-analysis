Scottie 2 Hottie Lyrics
by Two-9.


NAACP, can't no bitch excite.
me.
I need a Rolex, no Breitling,.
if them people spot me.
I call for god for lightning,.
I'm going hard and your pockets hurt.
I see why you don't like me, I see why you don't, uh.
Clicquot, Enrico, I'm all.
about them C-notes.
Your main ho a fall-see-toe, Falsetto, Falsetto.
All my work correct though, shout out my connect though.
I swear I breathe the best smoke, some my tree from the deck though.
Can't cop no weed at Texaco,.
some of these niggas still stressing though.
I'mma teach them my lesson though, I teach them my lesson.
though.
Popped a bean, popped, popped, a bean.
Aye, popped a bean, popped, popped, a bean.
Ho.

I just got a pack, tell my bitch roll it.
Tryna' stack that paper to the point where it's not folding.
Can't no nigga do like me,.
Vodka straight, no chaser.
Only after that paper, but them fuck niggas still hating.
Two-9 to that grave dirt,.
smoked out till my chest hurt.
Good weed in my dutch, red box.
on my t-shirt, uh.
Niggas pocket watching, too much to count.
That checkered flag waving when I come around.
Yeah, it's waving when I come around.
If your bitch ain't at the crib that mean she came around.
Yeah, that mean she came around.
And that checkered flag waving when I come around.
