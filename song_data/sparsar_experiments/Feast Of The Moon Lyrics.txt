Feast Of The Moon Lyrics
by Vivid.

Kanji.

金色闇の深きこの場所で　全て忘れて踊ろうか？.
Everything going throw a way　この世を神が照らすまで.
銀色月の眠るこの場所で　全て忘れて踊ろうか？.
Everything going throw a way　この世を神が包むまで.
重なる鼓動にいつしか誘われ.
差し出すその手に理性は消えていく.

痛みのない安らぎから全てはそう夢になる.
Play back all night　狂ったように.

金色闇の深きこの場所で 　全て忘れて踊ろうか？.
Everything going throw a way　この世を神が照らすまで.
重なる鼓動にいつしか誘われ.
差し出すその手に理性は消えていく.

痛みのない安らぎから全てはそう夢になる.
Dancing all night　狂ったように.

痛みのない安らぎから全てはそう夢になる.
Play back all night 　狂ったように.
痛みのない安らぎから全てはそう夢になる.
Dancing all night　狂ったように.

Romaji.

Konjiki yami no fukaki kono basho de 　subete wasurete odorou ka?
Everything going throw a way 　kono yo wo kami ga terasu made.
Giniro tsuki no nemuru kono basho de 　subete wasurete odorou ka?
Everything going throw a way 　kono yo wo kami ga tsutsumu made.
Kasanaru kodou ni itsushika izanaware.
Sashidasu sono te ni risei ha kiete iku.

Itami no nai yasuragi kara subete ha sou yume ni naru.
Play back all night 　kurutta you ni.

English.

At the place of deep golden darkness 　do you forget everything and dance?
Everything going to throw a way 　until the gods shine down on this world.
At the place where the silver moon sleeps 　do you forget everything and dance?
Everything going to throw a way 　until the gods embrace this world.
Before I realized it I was enticed by beats which overlapped each other.
Reason disappeared with that hand that was held out.

Because of the painless tranquility, everything seemed to become a dream.
Play back all night 　as if to go wild.
