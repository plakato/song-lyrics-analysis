January 14th Lyrics
by Russian Red.

You, you were really sweet that night.
And you, you were dress in vynil style.
When I saw you I could only stop my dance.
You, you were really someone new.
Your pretty face reminded me of Robin Hood's.
And when you stepped in I could only walk straight to you.
Those were the times that we met.
Those were the times: we were there.
You, you were dancing to the beat.
Your pretty eyes where the only thing to see.
And when I walked in I started to believe.
Those were the times that we met.
Those were the times: we were there.
