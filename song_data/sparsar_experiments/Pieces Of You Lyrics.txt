Pieces Of You Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Pieces Of You, 
 
You, run it over 
Straight out the night. 
You come from nowhere and are caught in my life. 
I keep talking, but there's nothing to say. 
It is decided that you will have your way: 
So dance to the beat now honey, yeah 
Oh, you dance to the beat now: hey yeah, 
Just dance to the beat now honey, yeah 
You whisper, something that I cannot hear 
There's too much music going on in my Ears, 
My hearts moving up inside of my head, 
You slam, the breaks, but I'm already dead, 
You think that you understand 
I've got pieces of you in my hands 
And I'm trying to do what I can 
With these pieces of you in my hands: 
So dance to The beat now honey, yeah 
Oh you dance to the beat now: hey yeah 
Just dance to the beat now honey, yeah 
I keep talking 
Just keep talking. 
Just keep talking. 
You! Think that you understand 
I've got pieces of you in my hands. 
And I'm trying to do what I can 
With these pieces of you in my hands: 
So dance to the beat now honey, yeah 
Oh, you dance to the beat now: hey yeah, 
Just dance to the beat now honey, yeah 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Just, keep talking
