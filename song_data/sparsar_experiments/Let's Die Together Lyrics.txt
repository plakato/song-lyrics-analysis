Let's Die Together Lyrics
by Volcanoes.

Every time that we try to pick our heads up.
The weight comes crashing down on, on our shoulders like giants standing over.
us.
OUR HEAVY HEARTS IN OUR HANDS.

Pick through my brain I can't find a memory of when we weren't happy.

Don't let go of my hand this time; I can't tell you that it's alright.
