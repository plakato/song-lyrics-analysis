Orange Soda Lyrics
by XO (Producer).


O.G Kush with a little orange soda 
O.G Kush with a little orange soda 
O.G Kush with a ... O.G Kush with a ... 
O.G Kush with a little orange soda 
 
You can call me plane site chilling cos. I can't afford the jet fare 
Fresh air stepping in a fresh pair 
Spit raw. I guess like I was prepped rare, 
Like fuck heaven. If you can't have sex there, 
I'm trynna stand up shopper at my set there. 
Probably ballin' shit reckon set there 
You know see. I just tell you where my mind goes: 
Cos' honesty is the only way we define flows. 
I am simply just addicted to being an addict 
Riding with that nigga who being a dick 
If. I say that my flow is ill, don't mean that it's matic 
It mean that my glow kill my nigga. It'S tragic 
30,000 views just a nigga from his laptop 
Fucking. More women that look better than your backdrop, 
They, don't know my name till they heard. We met the game. 
I tell'em we made the same I'mma mac. Give me laptop 
Yeah cos'. It'S all. I really need 
Said. It'S all. I really need 
 
Okay. We sippin' on kalesack chubbin', like Keenan 
Only, the finest, if you wonder what I mean and ... 
My team in and I believe the unbelievable 
I summon my inner chi and nothing is unachievable. 
Only doing shows where the checks is receivable. 
I treat rap like a heat fan who don't believe the bull 
54th platoon here and the fleet is full 
We getting so high. We'Ll never need a stool 
Yeah but middle finger to you other guys, 
Smart nigga, never thinking otherwise, 
Yeah see, I'm just trynna, be the manigoat 
Nigga and hard work is life's anecdote 
How, the fuck. You think we on the beaches, eating cantaloupe, 
So motherfuck, your dreams wishes and the hopes 
But. You can take it to a panel vote 
G.O.O.G. It'S the little things that matter most 
Yeah cos'. It'S all. I really need 
Said. It'S all. I really need
