Orange Soda Lyrics
by XO (Producer).


O.G Kush with a little orange soda.
O.G Kush with a little orange soda.
O.G Kush with a... O.G Kush with a....
O.G Kush with a little orange soda.

You can call me plane site chilling cos I can't afford the jet fare.
Fresh air, stepping in a fresh pair.
Spit raw, I guess like I was prepped rare.
Like fuck heaven if you can't have sex there.
I'm trynna stand up shopper at my set there.
Probably ballin' shit, reckon set there.
You know, see I just tell you where my mind goes.
Cos' honesty is the only way we define flows.
I am simply just addicted to being an addict.
Riding with that nigga who being a dick.
If I say that my flow is ill, don't mean that it's matic.
It mean that my glow kill my nigga, it's tragic.
30,000 views, just a nigga from his laptop.
Fucking more women that look better than your backdrop.
They don't know my name till they heard we met the game.
I tell 'em we made the same, I'mma mac give me laptop.
Yeah, cos' it's all I really need.
Said it's all I really need.

Okay, we sippin' on kalesack, chubbin' like Keenan.
Only the finest if you wonder what I mean and....
My team in and I believe the unbelievable.
I summon my inner chi and nothing is unachievable.
Only doing shows where the checks is receivable.
I treat rap like a heat fan who don't believe the bull.
54th platoon here and the fleet is full.
We getting so high, we'll never need a stool.
Yeah, but middle finger to you other guys.
Smart nigga, never thinking otherwise.
Yeah, see I'm just trynna be the manigoat.
Nigga, and hard work is life's anecdote.
How the fuck you think we on the beaches eating cantaloupe.
So motherfuck your dreams, wishes and the hopes.
But you can take it to a panel vote.
G.O.O.G, it's the little things that matter most.
Yeah, cos' it's all I really need.
Said it's all I really need.
