Love Song For The Dead Che Lyrics
by United States of America.

A the dawn of an ordinary Sunday.
I remember the taste of you, sweet in my mouth.
Late in the year.
And in the stillness of the Oriente rainfall.
I remember the warmth of you, still in my arms.
Late, late in the year.

I will bring to you flowers in the night.
Soft as trembling fingers touch you--love.
I can offer you wine and candlelight.
Late in the year.
Late in the year.
