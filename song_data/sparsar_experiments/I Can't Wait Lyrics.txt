I Can't Wait Lyrics
by U-N-I.


I can't wait to get.
I can't wait to get.
I can't wait to get to school each day.

Thank mom for keeping me fresh, been stuntin since a toddler.
Surrounded by them school girl, smilin in my styler.
The bet was to sex her, by the show.
of hands.
How many people put that condom on backwards?
I snuck porno's but was nervous as fuck.
Embarrassed as teen, less than 20 got nut.
She was fakin from the V, yellin names out and such.
Put the rubber in the toilet and that shit wouldn't FLUSH!!!
Aw Fuck, that's another story.
Moms though it was cute so she shared with her employees.
Thanks to Allen ?, the only Sophomore playin Varsity ball.
Which lead to upper class Punany.
I can't wait for Free Dress just to show what Santa got.
Was so excited, I laid my cloths across the futon.
Hallways was crowded, please watch for my sneakers.
Catholic girls give me kisses, couple pounds to my Nigga.

Cubic Zirconias, I'm hidin my boner.
Lookin up Ajya's skirt, I hope she's a nasty girl like Apollonia.
Of Vanity 6, 8 ? 856, to be the admiration of her eye.
Is the golden gist, I wore my white AF-1's and banner.
Hopin she can accommodate advantage this thing.
Trippin in a trans, hopin for a sexual advance.
In first period, thinkin bout the last ?
When I had my Tommy Hil, and she backed it up a lil.
And my hand slipped just to get a feel.
And she accidentally felt on my piece like EEEWW!
Had to calm the bulg in my Girbaud's like CHILL!!!
Off to second period the halls I roam.
Knowin these birds smell my Polo Sport Cologne.
If not that it was Dolce and Gabbana.
Signin off Thurzday it's Curly Tops and Nautica.

I can't wait to get.
I can't wait to get.
I can't wait to get to school each day.

I can't wait to get to school to day.
