Blind Faith Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.


I've been the distance and I've seen it all.
I've been turned around by love and hate.
I have resided in my private hell.
But I love this life and I live to tell.

Blind Faith is the cause of the trouble.
Blind faith what we bleed.

When I was young I didn't realize.
There was hope and fear with no compromise.
And now I testify before myself.
I keep walking on in my innocence.

I know if you follow me- you get what want, you get what you need.
Somebody's got to set you free- you get what want, you get what you need.
Now don't you give it and learn to breathe.
You hear a message now before you leave.
You know the fortune here that you have found.
There ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it.
