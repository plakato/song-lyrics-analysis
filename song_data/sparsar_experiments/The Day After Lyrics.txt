The Day After Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


Woke up in my back car seat fucked up.
And someone jacked my car keys.
Pardon me, ma'am, sir, which one I'm not damn sure.
But are we in New Hampshire? Yeah.
Puzzled, like how the fuck my '99 Corolla make it here, What!?
And frankly it's cold as fuck so I'm escaping here.
That a bakery near? Mosey on over cause my nuts are freezing up.
If I get cup checked they'll probably bust up like a cheap bust.
Now I'll never have kids, oh so tragic.
But the fact is I'm glad that act happened.
Now I'm back in that bitch packing it in raw.
Fuck a rubber band, my dick will stand tall.
Hold up, getting ahead of myself.
I'm in the store knocking off bread on the shelf.
A hungover deadbeat if you can't tell.
Don't give a fuck 'till I'm dead and in hell, woah.
But first I need to find my key, Where is it?
The thief blending in pretending to be Loki fucking around.
But what he doesn't know is me.
I'm on the prowl and going Pro Elite.
A ninja finna bust out the motherfucking nunchuks.
On a motherfucker deserving a coffin that's six in mud.
Man I don't give a fuck, the shotgun slug is looking mighty dub.
I'm finding love in it like Southerners.
I'm twisting it up, I'm fucked.
Ty, my boy, you need to slow down..
Fuck you bitch!, then I swing and knock him out.
Pick my key up, look around, then I'm out.
Thank you!, straighten my back and then I bow.

Any situation I've got in hand.
No persuasion, my thoughts is damned.
Always switching what is not in mind.
Fuck it, I'm moving to Nottingham.
Fuck it.
