All I Need Lyrics
by Unity Klan.


Im sick of the lies.
Im sick of the games.
Im sick of the pain.
All I need is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

Im sick of the flesh.
Can't handle the flesh.
Live and die in the flesh.
All I need is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

Who I need as I plead the blood of Christ on my life.
So open up your eyes, realize, hear the cries, no demize.
Devil, even wickedness dont try lies.
My life, here placed in God's hands I stand.
Im never gonna trip, dont devil stick, on the jes tip tip, we got the grip.
grip.
So I announce pronounce the Holy Script Script.
Check it, in HIM no sin my friend within.
From the top drop, dont stop to rock eternity.
The trinity, infinity, all I need Romans 8 3 9.
Its time to find the line and read.
No hieght not depth no light no death.
Til my very last breath, God's love still left.
I pass that test, give God my best til I find HIS rest.
Yes.

Ain't nobody gonna cry.
Ain't nobody gonna die.
Street of Gold where I reside.
HE'LL wipe the tear drops from my eyes.
Oh what a day, when Jesus cracks the sky.
My eyes will cry no more.
All my clothes be layin on the floor yo.

DG Warrior.
Holy Spirit, come down fill me now, what.
Pray everyday, stay strong.
My wrong make it right.
In my Holy rhymes, give my dad props.
My self wanna rise, gotta put it down.
Underground, gotta drown gotta clown.
Dirty flesh, already test, condemed it.
Gonna buck ya down, gonna buck ya down.
Break it off somethin proper.
Be a devil stomper.
Gotta go and follow.
When I fall my LORD Jesus Christ.
For life is what, when I want to do.
Preach teach and raise.
Preach praise and raise.

Higher Higher Higher.
9x.

DG Warrior.
Fly to the sky wit your wings spread wide.
Were gonna worship God the Most High.
Get on the right route, to the J side.
That be Jesus, the number one.
One begotten son there ever was on a cross.
Devil got tossed, lost, messin wit the boss.
That be sittin on the throne, hittin hard to the devil's dome.
Right to the soul, and flow wit the ghost.
And the KING OF KINGS, LORD OF LORDS.
My savior, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

Gotta put down for my LORD.
4x.

Big J.
Im sick of all this flesh.
Got me caught up in all this mess.
LORD can I handle this test.
Servin you the very best.
Yes I gots to do whats true.
Heaven or Hell what I'm gonna do.
I better pick you, without you my life is through.
I dont need more of me, I need more you.
LORD my flesh is feelin weak.
Cause the devil tryin to pin me tempt me.
Hit me down, keep me down.
I need you round, won't you break him on down.
Tired of all this mess I'm in.
Tryin to do your will, but I end in sin.
Try to do right, but I end in wrong.
I need your strengh to keep pressin on.
Hello fellow mellow tenth flow let me get my flow, here I go.
Wanna praise the Most High, serve you til the day that I die, I cry.
Holy is the Lamb, the Great I AM, the Son of Man and I can.
Grab your hand, and seek your face in a Holy place and follow your plan.

Homies scold me, know me.
Take me take me, break me brake me, shake me shake me.
Reach me reach me, teach me teach me, meet me meet me.

Big J.
I can't help myself, Ive done fell myself.
I gotta die myself, that means no more self.
All I need is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
No one else.
