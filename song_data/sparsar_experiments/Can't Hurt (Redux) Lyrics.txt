Can't Hurt (Redux) Lyrics
by UNKLE.

You can't hurt me now.
You can't hurt me now.
Never is easy.
Never is easy.
Just think what you're sayin'.

You know that I won't bleed.
Just try to cut me.
You know that I won't bruise.
Just try to beat me.
You know that I won't burn.
Just try to light me.
You know that I won't die.
Just try to kill me.

No, I won't let go.
No, I won't let go.
Never is easy.
Never is easy.
Never is easy.
Exist in the shadows.

You can't cut me now.
You can't cut me now.
Never is easy.
Never is easy.
Never is easy.
Exist in the shadows.

You know that I won't bleed.
Just try to cut me.
You know that I won't bruise.
Just try to beat me.
You know that I won't burn.
Just try to light me.
You know that I won't die.
Just try to kill me.

You can't hurt, you can't hurt, you can't hurt me.
You assume all about this, about me.
In a world that consumes me completely.
On a day when I don't trust myself.

You know that I won't bleed.
Just try to cut me.
You know that I won't bruise.
Just try to beat me.
You know that I won't burn.
Just try to light me.
You know that I won't die.
Just try to kill me.

You can't hurt, you can't hurt, you can't hurt me.
You assume all about this, about me.
In a world that consumes me completely.
On a day when I don't trust myself.

You can't hurt, you can't hurt, you can't hurt me.
You assume all about this, about me.
In a world that consumes me completely.
On a day when I don't trust myself.
