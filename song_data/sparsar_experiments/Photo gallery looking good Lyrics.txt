Photo gallery looking good Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

I am recommended by the best suffering to much i need some air in my lungs i.
be a head of time we must continue or we will die in this desert suffering.
from hot degrees blood running through these veins i am gifted not blessed buy.
u a gift trade your ideas for a better one so many groups in the city i am.
hiding in sight press down your brakes u look tight right about now unlock.
these locks with the keys shell cases on the floor shooting from a windows you.
can't survive these bullets running through fast on your skin I am the watcher.
your the movie the bigger the brain the smarter u get I am your answer i be.
solving your problems so easy with a math book numbers and letters be the key.
i gotta keep it low key u never find out what i think I am locked in a cell.
trying to figure out what going on i be the sergeant operating on these people.
director of the movie u watching h d to hard to read clear eyes help out a lot.
penetration through these walls bullets fuck up your body harmony sounds to.
good to be true reading books till I am blind so much support you need apps to.
understand whats going on photos look like a photo gallery from eye sight i.
just started learning other words years ago i can't believe i made history.
