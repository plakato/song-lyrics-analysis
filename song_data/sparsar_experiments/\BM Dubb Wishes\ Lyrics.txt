\BM Dubb Wishes\ Lyrics
by TwonDon.


I got B.M Dubb Wishes, Tryna stack my riches.
But every nigga got his hand out this shits ridiculous.....

I got B.M.Dubb Wishes, tryna stack my riches/.
But every nigga got his hand out this shits ridiculous/.
Same for the bitches so we watch who we kissin'/.
I just count every dollar til them bills stop flippin'/.
Til that shit turn endless, cause this my only way/.
I gotta hustle in any struggle I learned that from Jay/.
And how to hold my own weight, Open these doors for my click/.
Cause AZ told me in '94 dawg that Life Is A Bitch/.
But we still livin', play my position/.
Who competition in my land dog I got tunnel vision/.
And momma need em more then I do, Ima make a million/.
Cop her that coupe said fuck a stoop I move her in them buildings/.
Ya niggas feel em/.
Look, started The Gallery to boost up my salary/.
Niggas mad at me, I'm eating though I ain't miss a calorie haha/.
High as the attic be, The God is finna blow/.
Just for show, shorty gon roll....../.
Cause she know.

I got B.M Dubb Wishes, Tryna stack my riches/.
But every nigga got his hand out this shits ridiculous/.
Yeah, said this shits ridiculous/.
And told my niggas quit the bitchin' cause we still living/ x2.

Since 16, I always had a dream/.
To bring the finer things that my team ain't never seen/.
I swear - my only wishes/.

To change Christmas, and cop new wheels when I feel for lane switching/.
Yeah, on auto-pilot how I move is so quiet/.
Before the storm you was warned all my niggas skipped diets/.
We tryna eat, speaking through these beats/.
Witness our hunger while we starved all ya niggas feast/.
No time to think - we keeping afloat we watch you niggas sink/.
Like Titanic on any planet I could stack these G'z/.
Nigga please - I breeze through this cheese til my mind is at ease/.
Cause with the blessings it's more stressing that shit come in 3's/.
UC... staying golden finding peace in these poems/.
Bible scriptures and rap niggas the shit we be quotin'/.
I just F-F-Flowin', while my empire growing/.
It's in the showing I'm potent - Im running these tracks til my wheels.
goinggggg/.
