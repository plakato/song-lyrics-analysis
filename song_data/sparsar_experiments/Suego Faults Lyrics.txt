Suego Faults Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Suego Faults.

You went so long to find, to find your body by the lights of the circus show.
I tried to understand, but you said logic is a thing that I will never know.
Two can play the games you play.
Where will you go running when the grounds leave?
Traveling all on your own, you say i'm distraught.
But I know everyone needs.

I want to know, if you'll go with me to Suego Faults.

It's hard to draw the line and walk across when you can't see the safety net.
And everywhere I go, everybody living in someone else's debt.
Two can play the games you play.
Where will you go running when the grounds leave?
Traveling out on our own, the world seems small but I have you beside me.

I want to know...
If you'll go with me, to Suego Faults.

Running to Suego Faults.
Running to Suego Faults.

Two can play the games you play.
Where will you go running when the grounds leave?
Traveling all on your own, you say I'm distraught.
But I know everyone needs.

I want to know...
If you'll go with me, to Suego Faults.
