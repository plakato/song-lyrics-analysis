Poor Girl Lyrics
by X.

You sat at home.
The windows tinted black.
It hits you hard.
And you cried so long.
Life turned and wandered.
Never to come back, again.
Take what she gives you.
Don't feel sorry for her.
When you fell out.
Out of the Starlight Inn.
You were too hurt to walk.
Too bad to begin.
I looked at the sign.
But I couldn't feel sad for you.
Take what she gives you.
Don't cry, when you kiss her.
Poor little girl.
Ran away for good.
I try to explain.
Why she won't say a thing.
Sad, sad thing.
I'm so far away now.
How can I say.
Why she won't talk at all.
She holds the deck of cards.
She wants to be alone.
I've been very ill and I tried waking up.
Now, I want to be alone.
When you ran out.
Out of Petes' Hotel.
You didn't look so good.
And you didn't feel so well.
You said, Hold me tight.
But I couldn't get it right.
Take what she gives you.
Don't feel sorry for her.
Poor little girl.
Ran away for good.
I try to explain.
Why she won't say a thing.
Sad, sad thing.
I'm so far away now.
How can I say.
Why she won't talk at all.
She holds the deck of cards.
She wants to be alone.
She still drinks in the dark.
The radio is left on late.
She saw a madman fight.
And break it all.
Cause she hated himself.
And she felt better off.
Cause she was only drunk.
