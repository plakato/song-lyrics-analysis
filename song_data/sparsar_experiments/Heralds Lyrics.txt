Heralds Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

Check my pulse, am I still breathing?
Will You grasp my wrist and hold it dear to, to You heart?
To see if I am beating for You and only You my Father.
How we live and fight is who we are!
Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?
Who you are is all from Me.
I'm leaving behind the things of this world.
Follow me my son and let the dead bury their own.
So test me oh Lord, examine my soul.
Follow me my son for what you reap you will have sown.
Give light to my eyes to see Your glory divine and break through these skies.
Hear me when I cry to see Your grace come down and purge these dead lives.
Have I not given you a spirit of power and love?
I will live to fight for these dead lives.
Have I not given you a spirit of power and love?
How we live and fight is who we are.
And as You dwell inside my heart your burning a fire that's growing.
So when I feel the warmth subside rekindle the embers that's burning.
Check my pulse, am I still breathing?
Will You grasp my wrist and hold it dear to You heart?
To see if I am beating for You.
A herald I am.
A mirror to Me.
For sin is destroyed.
You've been set free.
How we live the fight is who we are.
Who you are is all from Me.
You will suffer but my strength is enough.
Still send me.
Though You will suffer your strength is in Me.
Still send me.
