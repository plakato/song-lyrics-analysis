All You Had To Do Was Stay Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.


People like you always want back.
The love they gave away.
And people like me wanna believe.
When you say that you've changed.
The more I think about it now.
The less I know.
All I know is that you drove us off the road.

All you had to do was stay.
All you had to do was stay.
Had me in the palm of your hands.
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay, hey.
Now you say you want it back.
Now it's just too late.
Well, it could have been easy.
All you had to do was stay.

Here you are now calling me up.
But I don't know what to say.
I've been picking up the pieces.
Of the mess you made.
People like you always want back.
The love they pushed aside.
But, people like me are gone forever.
When you say goodbye.

Stay, all you had to do was stay.
Had me in the palm of your hand.
Why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
Stay, hey.
Now you say you want it back.
It's just too late.
Well, it could have been easy.
All you had to do was stay.
Well, it could have been easy.
All you had to do was stay.
Could've been easy.
All you had to do was stay.
Stay, all you had to do was stay.

All you had to do was stay.
All you had to do was stay.
All you had to do was stay.
All you had to do was stay.
All you had to do was stay.
