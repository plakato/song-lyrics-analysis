1 Line Niggas Lyrics
by 50 Cent.


I'm tryin to tell you but you won't hear me son.
The nigga be right there in front of them buildings.
Yeah nigga, yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah nigga, yeah.
Yeah nigga, yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah nigga, yeah growls.

I line niggas, I do my homework.
I find niggas, the niggas that did that.
They my niggas, you bring that bullshit.
'round my niggas, you die, DIE NIGGA DIE!
50 Cent.
I right 'bout where your man'll stay, my man blew your man away.
Did him dirty and ran away, who's the next candidate?
Get hit with the cannon AY! You lil' niggas wan' play.
We can go back and forth and pour yay.
Let it off, hop in the rental car, pull away smooth.
Put that twerk in that work and we at you with the tools.
Nigga we ain't sellin packs no more so we ain't on the strip.
Get that llama in the 'Llac strapped leanin in the whip.

50 Cent.
First I find your bitch creep, then we found a nail shop.
Now would you looky here, we done found your momma's spot.
It's so easy, damn I'm greasy.
Goons don't use Auto-Tune,.
that's Yeezy.
Yeah, summer now, good time to hunt you down.
Keep the pump around, we catch him we gon' slump him now.
Timin is everything, I plot it out perfect.
Drop a bag off to my nigga just to make it worth it.

Nigga whattup!
These niggas think I'm playin with 'em, yeah.
Niggas smilin and shit, go 'head nigga!
Keep thinkin I'm careful.
I'll shoot the SHIT out of these niggas man.
I let my niggas go, WATCH!
OH MY GOD! Y'all niggas KNOW ME.
Y'all wasn't supposed to let me get this money!
Now what?
