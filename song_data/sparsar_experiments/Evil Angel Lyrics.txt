Evil Angel Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

For to see my depth of sorrow
You are not allowed to follow me
Unto. This town square
And then run away

Evil angel with your cleft tongue
When. You kissed me
On this town, square
All, the lights came on at sunset
Thought, you'd stay

Evil angel, bearin' apples
When, you kissed me

As. The boats do
How was I to know you'd flee

Tear down these monuments
Bury the coat of arms
And build for me, a factory

Evil angel when you're faced with
Hatred's daggers in my honor
You're, no match
No scratching hearts that no longer bleed

Oh evil angel tear down the monuments
Oh evil angel bury the coat Of arms
And rebuild for me these memories
For, to see my depth of sorrow
