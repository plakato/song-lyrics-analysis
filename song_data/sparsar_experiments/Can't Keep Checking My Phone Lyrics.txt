Can't Keep Checking My Phone Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


Aurora Borealis, me for her for real it's lust.
The love can't be heard above.
Everyone acts like a day drinker, yeah.

We eat crickets.
In the future.
Just tastes like.
“Far-from-home”.
Drink chicha.
In the jungle.
That sounds great.
I'm kinda busy, could you call back again?
I'm sure you'll come back.
'Til then, I....

I can't keep checking my phone, no.
I can't keep checking my phone, no.
I can't keep checking my phone, no.
I can't keep checking my phone.

We eat crickets.
In the future.
Just tastes like.
“Far-from-home”.
Drink chicha.
In the jungle.
That sounds great.
I'm kinda busy, could you call back again?
I'm sure you'll come back.
'Til then, I....

I can't keep checking my phone, no.
I can't keep checking my phone, no.
I can't keep checking my phone, no.
I can't keep checking my phone.
