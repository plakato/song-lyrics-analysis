Bottle Poppin' Lyrics
by Yung Joc.


We bottle poppin, we-we bottle poppin, x3.
Say-say u gettin money, we-we ain't seen nuttin.
We bottle poppin, we-we bottle poppin x3.
Say-say u gettin money, we-we ain't seen nuttin.

Yung Joc.
I pull up to the club, jumpin' out of rovers.
Lookin' like a car show, dat's da way we roll up.
Dope bois showin love, all da ho's know of us.
Need extra security, dey know dey can't control us.
I see some niggas hatin, I keep dat supersoaker.
So I V.I.P. my way standin on da sofas.
Now watch me demonstrate da way a playa post up.
I don buried cha weight, u know we throw dem toast up.
Say ya gettin guap, well shawty we ain't heard bout it.
Finna set-up shop, well we ain't even worried bout it.
Word on da block, oh dey say u servin pie.
I think ya need ta stop, I got some killas dat'll get dat work up out 'em.
I dont got luv fa u busta's, unless u my kinfolk.
Yea u smell dat fruity fruit err'time da wind blow.
I throw away dat chump change, I'm all abot dat bigga dough.
Joc a real hood nigga, just like Gorilla Zoe.

Gorilla Zoe.
When da money start droppin, all da ho's start jockin.
When dem ho's start jockin, dem bottles start poppin.
When dem bottles start poppin, know dat we're not stoppin.
Imma keep bringin bottles, den dem models start flockin.
Imma throw a stack, she gon' throw it back.
I pop da rubberband, she gon' pop ha back.
She know dat I ball, she gon' grind da wall.
She gon' bust it open, fo me &amp; my dawgs.
Got boi's in da club comin' fresh from the trap.
Watch dem boi's cuff they gurls, cuz dey know we got dem stacks.
We in da middle of da flo' blowin cush packs.
I got my workers in da bathroom, sellin pill packs.
Now da party don't stop cuz dey we got dat guap.
She gon' make ha booty clap and Imma throw another knot.
When da money still phat, dey know dat its a wrap.
Bottle poppin ova here, tell dat DJ run it back.

Yung Joc.
When my nigga Steve died.
U know we popped dem bottles.
Niggas tried to run &amp; hide.
We went lookin wit dem choppas.
Now it's time to take a ride in dat all black Impala.
If u niggas think im lyin' I put dat on my momma.
And dats why err'time, his birthday come up.
Imma hit da town, from sun down-ta-sun up.
Buy a couple rounds, till dey all get drunk up.
Fo my nigga, I'm a clown.
Like the numba 1 stunna.
Yea we in da club, my niggas on a pill or two.
Throw dat bitch a dub, tell dat ho' I'm feeling you.
Pour ha some of dis bub, yea dat's what I'm finna do.
Den I ask a question, shorty what'chu in to?
Den she started blushing, told me bring a friend or two.
A whole lotta rubba's we gon' cut her like a gin-su.
Flexin bout some money, dat's da shit beginna's do.
She know I'm gettin' money and she wanna be a winna too.
