All I Know Lyrics
by Vizual.


You are tuned in to Vizual redemption E.P.. Now 
 
I swear it's all it's all. It'S all 
The life I'll ever know Know know, 
I swear it's all it's all. It'S all 
The life I'll ever know Know know. 
This life is all I know. 
 
People claiming 
That, they miss the old me 
Why. Would you miss that 
I was acting so phony? 
People love me because 
Of my immaturity? Well 
Now, I'm seventeen 
I'm trying to live holy 
But. Yet 
This battle is a conquest 
Still fighting my flesh, 
Is, so monstrous. 
Trying to fight this alone, 
Got myself, stoned, 
Giants, so high 
My own will can't take control, 
Everyday battles, 
Everyday war 
Enduring, the pressure 
Spotted in the radar 
Desensitized to the culture 
Trying to stay alarmed 
Fools believe fools 
Deceiving to disarmed 
Fo-show 
The world got me so locked Up 
Trapped inside this bondage, 
Heart st-rucked 
I tried to let the world 
Teach me how to live 
Nothing but wickedness Jesus come in 
 
I swear. It'S all it's all. It'S all 
The life I'll ever know Know know, 
I swear it's all it's all. It'S all! 
The life I'll ever know Know know. 
This life is all I know. 
 
People started disappearing. 
Serving the lost 
My life isn't about me 
Talked about my first 
Lover in the building. 
They call me crazy. 
The truth got me craving 
No longer see a lot of faces. 
Time to fish for man, 
Soul saving, 
Sorry coach, but my master called my races 
No longer in the track. 
Treasures now are waitin' 
Telling myself to take up my cross 
Pleasures of this world 
Tried. To put me off the rock 
If, I ruin my rep 
Just know it isn't: God 
My self-got me driven 
I'm trying to kill em 
Uh 
Father. Forgive me for my foolishness. 
Every time I fall. 
I get your forgiveness 
I. Keep asking this! Isn'T fair 
But! You still care 
The cross is so bloody 
That. My sins are not there. 
 
I swear it's all. It'S all. It'S all 
The life I'll ever know Know know, 
I swear it's all it's all. It'S all 
The life I'll ever know Know know. 
This. Life is all I know: 
 
I'm new 
To, a couple of my old friends: 
I love you 
Even thoe. We all end 
Strangers from afar 
I'm on my mission, 
To bring the Glory of God 
To this premises, 
Took His grace for granted. 
Let this truth be stabbin'. 
To people's hearts, 
The void will not be at them. 
I wondered if 
This was really worth it. 
Scales outnumbered 
Finding out my purpose. 
If I'm gone 
Know, I found happiness 
In the risen Lord Jesus 
Get em, while you're at it 
Knocking on the door of your heart. 
Gasp it 
The world is full of bones. 
Carnally got you blacken, 
You, see the light 
In. The power of my words. 
This is my life. In these lines, 
Jesus is my report. 
What I was known, is the final 
Of. My written work 
The world is dead. To me, 
My savoir is all I know. 
 
The world is dead. To me, 
My savoir is all I know. 
The world is dead to me, 
My savoir is all I know.
