All I Know Lyrics
by Vizual.


You are tuned in to Vizual redemption E.P. Now!

I swear it's all it's all it's all.
The life I'll ever know, Know, know.
I swear it's all it's all it's all.
The life I'll ever know, Know, know.
This life is all I know.

People claiming.
That they miss the old me.
Why would you miss that.
I was acting so phony.
People love me because.
Of my immaturity, Well.
Now I'm seventeen.
I'm trying to live holy.
But yet.
This battle is a conquest.
Still fighting my flesh.
Is so monstrous.
Trying to fight this alone.
Got myself stoned.
Giants so high.
My own will can't take control.
Everyday battles.
Everyday war.
Enduring the pressure.
Spotted in the radar.
Desensitized to the culture.
Trying to stay alarmed.
Fools believe fools.
Deceiving to disarmed.
Fo-show.
The world got me so locked up.
Trapped inside this bondage.
Heart st-rucked.
I tried to let the world.
Teach me how to live.
Nothing but wickedness Jesus come in.

I swear it's all it's all it's all.
The life I'll ever know, Know, know.
I swear it's all it's all it's all.
The life I'll ever know, Know, know.
This life is all I know.

People started disappearing.
Serving the lost.
My life isn't about me.
Talked about my first.
Lover in the building.
They call me crazy.
The truth got me craving.
No longer see a lot of faces.
Time to fish for man.
Soul saving.
Sorry coach but my master called my races.
No longer in the track.
Treasures now are waitin'.
Telling myself to take up my cross.
Pleasures of this world.
Tried to put me off the rock.
If I ruin my rep.
Just know it isn't God.
My self-got me driven.
I'm trying to kill em.
Uh.
Father forgive me for my foolishness.
Every time I fall.
I get your forgiveness.
I keep asking this isn't fair.
But you still care.
The cross is so bloody.
That my sins are not there.

I swear it's all it's all it's all.
The life I'll ever know, Know, know.
I swear it's all it's all it's all.
The life I'll ever know, Know, know.
This life is all I know.

I'm new.
To a couple of my old friends.
I love you.
Even thoe we all end.
Strangers from afar.
I'm on my mission.
To bring the Glory of God.
To this premises.
Took His grace for granted.
Let this truth be stabbin'.
To people's hearts.
The void will not be at them.
I wondered if.
This was really worth it.
Scales outnumbered.
Finding out my purpose.
If I'm gone.
Know I found happiness.
In the risen Lord Jesus.
Get em while you're at it.
Knocking on the door of your heart.
Gasp it.
The world is full of bones.
Carnally got you blacken.
You see the light.
In the power of my words.
This is my life in these lines.
Jesus is my report.
What I was known is the final.
Of my written work.
The world is dead to me.
My savoir is all I know.

The world is dead to me.
My savoir is all I know.
The world is dead to me.
My savoir is all I know.
