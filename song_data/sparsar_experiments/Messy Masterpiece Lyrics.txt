Messy Masterpiece Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

Son, you are my song. Let's hear something beautiful.
As you look upon your messy masterpiece.
My heart beats one step ahead of my feet.
No guilt in life, no fear in death from life's first cry to final breath.
No power of hell, no scheme of man can ever pluck me from my Father's hand. *.
Love of the Father is the only hope for a wayward son.
Blood and water paved the painful road home done.
Grace and mercy come with every single morning dawn.
This heavenly heartbeat is the only reason I can carry on.
Kid, see yourself through your Father's eyes.
It's not the same shade as the world cries.
I confess I don't know much about love.
Where it's from is just so high above.
But until my time arrives, love is the reason I'm alive.
Son, you are my song. Let's hear something beautiful.
As you look upon your messy masterpiece.
My heart beats one step ahead of my feet.
