Belong Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

I just want to belong.
I just want to belong.
I just want to belong!

I've been searching for far too long.
When I feel I've reached my destination.
I can't control these feelings.
I just wanna stop reaching.

Illuminate the path before me.
So I can finally find my way.
I've been dying to stop wandering.
I just want to know my place.

Don't we all just want to belong?
I don't know if I'm strong enough.
We'll find a better way.
I just want to belong.
Don't we all just want to belong?
I don't know if I'm strong enough.

Everyday I begin to hate this more.
Clinging on to a world so worn.
I know this feeling is feeling to familiar.
Cary on.

Do you know when you've seen it all.
The world around you doesn't make sense at all?
You got lost in your progress.

Illuminate the path before me.
So I can finally find my way.
I've been dying to stop wandering.
I just want to know my place.

Don't we all just want to belong?
I don't know if I'm strong enough.
We'll find a better way.
I just want to belong.
Don't we all just want to belong?
I don't know if I'm strong enough.

Here we go here we go, let's take this life.
And lets start living.
Here we go here we go, let's take this life.
And lets start living.
Here we go.
Let's take this life, let's start living.
Start living.
Let's take this life, let's start living.
Start living.

Don't we all just want to belong?
I don't know if I'm strong enough.
We'll find a better way.
I just want to belong.
Don't we all just want to belong?
I don't know if I'm strong enough.
We'll find a better way.
I just want to belong.
I've searched for far too long.
I can't control these feelings.
I found my destination.
I need to stop reaching.
Don't we all just want to belong?
I don't know if I'm strong enough.
