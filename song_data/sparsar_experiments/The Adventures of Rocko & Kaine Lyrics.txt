The Adventures of Rocko & Kaine Lyrics
by The 3rd Kind.


And... here... we... go.

Jakk The Rhymer.
I said come get some, ya little bum.
Penmanship warming up, Jakk parallel to 'Nam.
Peep the word play ain't nothin' to be drooled on.
I expunge of weak MC's, brutal vibe.
Rocko Kaine, ya you know it's the movement.
Be the first to shoot it up, soviet union.
Cat's say the comin' close to, come on man.
Hardly enough soul to take us to the homeland, Garvey.
And they wonderin' who are we, solar bright.
Bars that's takin' advantage, sodomite.
No ? type, we gon take off with it.
Known to be amazing, please don't get lost in it, the Rhymer!

I admit it's been fun, playin' the fool.
Waitin' for sideways cats, to make a move.
I use a word play arsenal aimed at tombs.
Make rappers cover they face, Dangerdoom.
I refrain from few, but I won't remain silent.
Deserve a refund, every time I pay hommage.
Bloggers tryna pirate my climate.
Cause Rocko &amp; Kaine warm it up, pyrex.

No lesson plans, should be left like ?
Develope arthritis and articles writin'.
Since Marty there hasn't been a MC as fly as this.
My pencil's like stencils of symmetry.
Resembles perfection, ya feelin' me?
When someone step to me it be , villainy, ventriliquism.
Removin' MC's with the lyrics of my finger tips.

Rocko get em.
Warm it up Kaine.

I believe what doesn't kill you simply makes you.
Stranger.
