Verbal Milk Lyrics
by X-Clan.

Yeuch! Brother J says yeuuch! Hmmhmmhmmhmm...

Professor X.
Ahhhh! Straight from the temple of everlasting.
ME! P.X.O., and the X-Clan.
Chillin, cleaning the pinkie.
Hey Brother J, time for a ride.
Put the key, to the ignition, and then...

Brother J.
Ah yes yes blue, ah come on to go.
We're immortals to the portals til the book folds.
I'm goin Blackwards to the East, tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum.
Fee fi fum to the tribal drum drum.
I'm sittin on my temple, just pluckin silly mortals.
Speakin peace of mind to my many sons and daughters.
Gettin loose, loose, as I release the juice.
I'm more into the  cause a simple Mother Goose.
Could never hang with the words, that ever caused the clamor.
I'm singin Raise the Flag cause I hate the Spangled Banner.
Because you can't get with me, you label me enemy.
Your comments on the mortal side are labelled as blasphemy.
More than I am, puts the taste in the dam.
Puts the X in the Clan that puts the brother on land.
It's like that y'all, ya don't stop.
Because the sight of the Watch is sure to shock.
From the beginning.
From the beginning is it winning, is it ever?
Unearthly, resistance, forever.
You think your thief based system is clever?
It's a simplistic, endeavor.
I checkmate, terminate, never late, contemplate.
Mindstate is never fake, hesitate you lose.
No shoes ever do I kick around in boots.
I simply drop the science that just speaks about the.
In our nature's, flavor, lacking from the coon.
Now our dream for the younger, when will the rover take reign?
Is it a joke or something you can't cope with.
Devils keep avoiding, people keep on hopin.
For the move and groove, put your dead body in a soothin mood.
Don't need no air, no sex, and no food.
The tool, is mine, to use - Blackward row.

Professor X.
Ahhhh.. riding the crossroad!
Brother J on the wheel.
Sugar Shaft in the back with Queen Nefretiti.
Yo J, push it to the full nine.
And let's move.. zoom!

Brother J.
Day two-dark-zero-zero and it circles degree.
Brother one makes up a system bring oppressors to knees.
I speak a language universal, check on how I use it.
Dwellers of this planet, labelled it as music.
I come and I go from where the land where the milk flows.
Earthbound to mortals what they lack the Brother will know.
I'm buildin temples made of MANY dimensions.
Illogic and cosmic, are not an extension.
Now many many gather and they say, Bro J;.
Tell me the direction of the crossroad way.
Up on the down stroke, valley in the middle.
On through the thorns as if you could ever figure.
Nothin is balance unless balance is irregular.
Misplaced, heed chaos to bass.
Some talk to doo-doo, and miss the voodoo.
I'm like the guru, your baby's doin judo.
Why don't you just sit, and contemplate on this.
This is much more than your white boy diss.
Or your fat gold chain, the wash on your brain.
The fleas in your system, what then remains.
But a science that's deeper than deep, nine the odd.
Harder than hard so now the journey to Gods begins.
From the blood to the greenest of earth.

And zeroes who remain in two truth is key.
To release us from the shackles Armageddeon will be.
It's like that y'all, ya don't stop.
Ah Sugar Shaft in the house ya don't stop.
Ah Brother J funkin lesson ya don't stop.
Ah Paradise architect ya don't stop.

X-Clan in the house, you don't stop.
Blackwatch for the justice you don't quit...

Professor X.
Ahhhhhh... listen.
With a diamond in the back, a sunroof top.
A ride called pinkie, and a black boot to the pedal.
Pushin us to the full nine.
We step to you in blackness, with a gangsta lean.
By the way, VANGLORIOUS.
This is protected, by the red, the black, and the green.
With a KEY, in the ignition, SISSYYYYYYY!
