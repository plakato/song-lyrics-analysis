A Guy Walks into a Bar Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Instrumental break.

The joke's on me and it ain't funny.
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming.
A mile away.
I've heard it so many times I can tell it.
To the T, believe me.
I could sell it.
All day.
It goes....

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink.
Sees a girl that catches his eye.
Asks her if she wants another.
They fall for each other and end up lovers.
They laugh, cry, hold on tight.
Make it work for a.
little while.
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark.
And a guy walks into a bar.

I'd laugh too if my heart would let me.
Keeping it light will probably help to get me.
Over you.
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof.
A clich√© in a corner booth.
Ain't nothing new.

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink.
Sees a girl that catches his eye.
Asks her if she wants another.
They fall for each other and end up lovers.
They laugh, cry, hold on tight.
Make it work for a little while.
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark.
And a guy walks into a bar.

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink.
Sees a girl that catches his eye.
Asks her if she wants another.
They fall for each other and end up lovers.
They laugh, cry, hold on tight.
Make it work for a little while.
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark.
And a guy walks into a bar.
