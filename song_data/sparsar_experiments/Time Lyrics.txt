Time Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

We are spend about life.
Get around, oh where in time.
Seems my mind goes like when.
Good times are coming back again.
People say that I'm wrong.
A man can't travel back alone.
I got to travel like life.
What I've done wrong.
I must make right.

Beat my mind.
See my sign.
Help me find, time.

Some things are thing's that I've done.
For no one a reason I will be hung.
I've got to go on the same.
Somewhere or something I clear my name.

Beat my mind.
See my sign.
Help me find time.
Time, time, time, time.
Time, time, time, time.
