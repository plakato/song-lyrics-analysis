Time Lyrics
by 4hero.

It'S time 
It's time little sparkle. In my eye, 
To fly 
It's time little sparkle. In my eye, 
To fly to fly, 
 
Please, Yahweh, 
Many named 
Don't, make go to the other side. 
Why 
Haven't. I been a good child. 
Why 
Haven't. I been a good child. 
 
Angels warn me 
Fallen Angels begging me 
As, Satan thinks to press me into service. 
I don't deserve this 
Curse, his Heavenly betrayal, 
 
Sell, my soul, 
Hold my fate, 
And onmi-hands 
Scatter, my purity like the sands of Twelve Tribes 
While. I hide in this flesh vessel. You given me 
 
Will, she protect me or she neglect me. 
 
Some thing like false security. 
These. These words of love, 
Soft, belly, rubs, 
This, wet warmth, 
This fetal, form, 
, 
My scorn becomes knead, 
And, no condition. 
And innocence seems like years from God's eye, 
To birth's, first cry: 
, 
Alive, 
Alive, 
Alive, 
Alive, 
, 
Alive, 
Alive, alive 
Alive, 
Alive, 
, 
My mortality, realize 
Now human child 
Now miles ahead and miles away. 
Miles ahead and miles away. 
 
I still feel betrayed. 
Mother'S milk, though somewhat hot 
Sweet and loving, but nothing 
No, nothing like mana, 
, 
Scanned the planet for my Earth. Nurse 

Blessed, unheavenly hearth with the gift of me 
I know she wants me 
But Evil's henchmen hunt me 
She'll need an army to keep harm from me. 
 
You're impunity. Depleases me as I grow 
Yet. This unity seizes me 
In time to be. I will cease to be yours, 
Yours 
Yours, 
, 
For, a score and several centuries 
Misery, not even a word 
Blurred by the beam of Eden. 
But circum-scheming made them heathen 
Circum-scheming made us heathens 
 
Fake churches choose renegade 
Resistors to truth. Twisters 
I want those demons screaming 
Underfoot of harken Angels' demise 
Won't be too painful. 
 
I've learned Darwin's Theory 
Well, just an ism 
No, not while my inner schism has me in its grasp 
Threatening to suck me like Cleopatra's asp, 
 
Now, I'm the one with loaded guns, 
Murdering, other mother's sons, 
Making devils swell with pride 
As. I ride Hadie's river-boat 
Choke on the blood of my victim's sin, 
My one desire, 
Stoke, the fires of Hell 
I'm in the belly of the beast, 
 
Peace and anomaly 
Covenance arc and Indiana Jones 
Myth to me. 
I join the rest to spit and pee on your memory. 
Your legacy, 
Your love for me, 
 
Maybe 
You'll, have someone put a bullet in my heart 
Start my journey 
No, not to kill me 
Just. To wake me. 
 
So, I surrender 
So. I remember 
The wealth of my name 
So. I remember 
The wealth of my name. 
 
My names have been 
Jesus, 
And, Moses, 
And, Mohammad 
I, see Heaven 
And, Kanin, 
And Mecca, 
 
My names have been 
Jesus, 
And, Moses, 
And Mohammad 
I, see Heaven 
And, Kanin 
And Mecca. 
I see Heaven 
And Kanin 
And Mecca, 
 
One, my return 
As, I return 
As, I return 
As, I return 
As. I return 
As. I return
