Simple Songs Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

I believe in pop music.
The way I wish I believed in God.
Completely.
And without question.
I wish there was.
Something higher.
That I could subscribe to.
To give my life.
Some direction.

Cuz I don't have.
A life plan.
I just have.
This little band.
Simple songs.
With simple chords.
But simple songs.
Won't save your soul.

The only thing.
That speaks to me.
Are catchy melodies.
The same chords.
All the time.
ECG.
The only damn thing.
That speaks to me.
