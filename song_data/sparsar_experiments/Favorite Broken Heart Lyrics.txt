Favorite Broken Heart Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

I was in my closet digging.
Came across some pictures.
And a couple letters you wrote kinda had me reminiscent.
Back when it was different.
Right before you let me go.
Cause even though we had to finish.

Baby, I admit it.
It was worth my heart getting broke.
Cause I ain't never had those feelings.
I didn't get to say it last time we spoke.

Even though it's goodbye.
Before I run into you.
I just wanted you to know.
You're my favorite broken heart.

Even though I cry.
I don't wanna be fair.
I'm always here for you.
You're my favorite broken heart.

So I ain't gotta blast your name in the streets.
And tell everybody that I regret about you.
And everything we went through.
It's between me and you, baby boy.

We ain't gotta be the clich√©.
Exes with the he say, she say.
Like we ain't grown.
If you ain't got nobody these days.
Maybe you can hit me on my cell phone.

It's been so long since I saw you.
But still I got nothing but love for you.
Tell me that you know.
That I'll always be here.
Whenever, whereever, forever.

Even though it's goodbye.
Before I run into you.
I just wanted you to know.
You're my favorite broken heart.

Even though I cry.
I don't wanna be fair.
I'm a always here for you.
You're my favorite broken heart.

Thank you.
If I could do it all again.
I'd do the very same thing.
Knowing that you would hurt me in the end.

Baby, I would do it all again.
Since I never knew.
Love was for real until I met you.
I know you'll be there whenever I need you.

No matter what.
I'm still your friend.
I know it sounds crazy.
But.

Even though it's goodbye.
Before I run into you.
I just wanted you to know.
You're my favorite broken heart.

Even though I cry.
I don't wanna be fair.
I'm a always here for you.
You're my favorite broken heart.
