Track 2 e Lyrics
by '68.

It doesn't matter what you say.
They could always disappear.
They'll fall asleep and never wake.
No one would hesitate.
Recollection, fact or fiction.
Revolution?
Churches collapsing.
Falling around me.
Revolutionless?

It doesn't matter if you respect or believe.
Because she could eat you like a full-grown disease.
I don't know if I have room to speak but.
You're a six foot man in the middle of a grave.

I'm not scared, I'm just bored.
I don't know if I can help anymore and that's what terrifies all of me.
Resurrect yourself.
Never underestimate the power of change.
