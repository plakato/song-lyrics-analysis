DejÂ¿ vu Lyrics
by 3OH!3.

Hey mister bartender, mix me a drink.
I really need something to tell me it's okay not to think.
Because I've been to all these bars and I've seen all these places.
I've hit on all these girls, I've heard the same conversations.
Cab driver, cab driver, take me away.
Cause I already know all the words that she'll say.
And I'll be creepin' out the window at the first sign of day.
Cause every single night it seems to go the same way.
I think I've been here before, I think I've run into you.
I know the things that you do, cause this is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
I think I've been here before, I think I've run into you.
I know the things that you do, cause this is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
Mister bartender, you will kick me out.
And the blonde girl in the back, you'll put your tongue down my mouth.
And the greaser in the jacket's gonna pick a fight.
And he'll probably kick my ass, cause I'm drunk every night.
Officer, officer, tell me the truth.
How many times can I get in trouble with you.
Before they lock me up for all the bad things I do?
But you don't, and that's why this feels like dja vu.
I think I've been here before, I think I've run into you.
I know the things that you do, cause this is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
I think I've been here before, I think I've run into you.
I know the things that you do, cause this is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
I did it like this, I did it like that.
And it always comes back around.
Cause I don't know how to break this pattern down.
I did it like this, I did it like that.
And it always comes back somehow.
I don't know how to break this pattern down.
I think I've been here before, I think I've run into you.
I know the things that you do, cause this is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
I think I've been here before, I think I've run into you.
I know the things that you do, cause this is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
This is dja vu.
