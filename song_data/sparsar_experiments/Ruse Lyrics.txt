Ruse Lyrics
by Ruse.

Hi, I'm Wyatt, bouncin off the walls. Man, I run riot.
Yall drop the ball like one's privates.
All in all, I rock the boat so call me a pirate.
Lookin for dope? Then I'm supplyin. Often outspoken but I oughtta keep quiet.
Mouth is always open but I'd probably pry it if I sealed it shut. Silence is.
for the calm.
I'm the bomb like a Muslim.
Yeah, I'm awesome. You can ask my mom.
Destroy every single track I'm on.
While havin a blast cause I'm the bomb.
I'm outta this world, ya gotta blast off.
To get to the frickin spacecraft that I'm on.
Sittin in the back with a six-pack.
Cause my friend has abs. Man, I'm fifteen, come on!
Think I'm whack? Well someone's wrong. I'll smack you with the back and then.
the palm.
Of my hand then cock back the other one and whack you with that in the same.
fashion.
Run fast, I'm comin after ya with nunchucks that I jacked from.
Mister Benton, I can't trust him. He pawned my stuff as crack fund.
Awesome when in action, throw caution to the wind when rappin.
You're coughin and I'm laughin. Must be the heat I'm packin.
In this pencil. Instrumentals always fall victim. It isn't incidental.
Give it a minute and I'll convince yall that lyricism isn't what I'm lackin at.
all.
I'm rad, and I'm backin it up. You're bad, cause your rappin sucks.
Same old crap about havin cash when actually, you make like seven and a half.
bucks.
I'm mad and I'm gonna erupt. If that is good, then I'm gonna give up.
Wait, I take that back. That makes me amazing as f***. Listen up.
Take me down now, I'm never givin up.
No way, no how I'm missin out on that much.
Patiently waitin to break new ground.
And if I break a leg, I will take the crutch.
Pound you in the face. Hate makes for a great grudge.
Make no mistake, the radio's full of drudge.
K Dot and Slim Shady raise the bar way up.
Far as I can see it, it remains untouched.
I don't give a dang if you bang sluts.
I could care less if you're caked up.
I hope and pray ya don't get famous.
If you're sayin the same stuff Wayne does.
Why must thou acquaint us with ways of goin about that're dangrous?
Martians, they'd hate us. Some brains need a change-up.
Not mine.
Don't cock nines, no Columbine.
Wolf Haley does, Tyler's fine.
Paradoxal lines, clock the time.
It takes me to make me a crazy buzz while these fakes just.
Watch the incline. I'm sublime and what I got.
Is top notch rhymes. I'm not even in my prime.
Remember that. Lost my mind but Imma get it back.
Just pass me that pen and pad then Imma write crap that'll mend the crack.
Been a minute and I defend the fact that I'm a lyricist with tremendous tracks.
If you're sayin swag in your raps, I'd recommend to put an end to that.
Swag's a fad. Fads change and it happens fast.
It's strange but that's a fact. Your brain flips faster than an acrobat.
Can't stand all this lame crap that's as fake as a Blaine magic act.
Make it rain, I'll make a cataract, a brainstorm to battle that.
I ain't the norm and that's great cause I hate the norm.
We're too great to conform with what's normal. Let's wage war.
And make more than a faint roar. Yeah, let's make em pay for.
Makin us feel strange for bein what's in our nature.
Watch me take the floor. Think I'm strange? Come on, take a tour.
Through my mind. You'll find fine lines beside neural pathways that'd make.
your legs sore.
I'm great, you're a waste of space that's wastin your.
Time trynna call me names when I think it's great to be strange.
So back up or get backup. Anger's stacked up.
Feel free to hate. You lack what makes me great. That's a.
Shame but it ain't bad luck. It's the way you were raised. Mom and dad fucked.
up.
And made you one to judge others instead of lovin on another.
People like you make me real butthurt. Wanna scream cuss words.
Cause you mother f***ers think it's cool and okay to ruin another person's.
whole day.
You won't ruin me. Keep goin, I'm doin fine.
You don't know the potential I hold but I know you will in due time!
I abuse lines. If that's a crime, screw a fine.
I'll do the time. I'll rewind this to remind myself that I'm too sublime.
What I got is gruesome rhymes made my an exuberant mind.
Combine that with my great flow. Now I know my future's fine.
Killin on sight, Medusa's eyes. Overreact like Pewdiepie.
When you hear this track, lose your mind. Hope to God that I blew your mind.
I'm Wyatt, I run riot. Screw that, I'm too devine.
I'm Ruse and I run riots. You can make fun but who's shinin now?
