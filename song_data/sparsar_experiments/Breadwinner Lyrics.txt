Breadwinner Lyrics
by Unknown Artist.

Flow like a river.
Hoping God's a forgiver.
So I don't go to Hell for living life as a sinner.
True breadwinner.
Eat you for dinner.
I didn't mean breakfast.
I'm always on the guest list.
I'm coming up.
Nobody would have guessed this.
Lethal raps coming from a chic that's chestless.
If I was on the bus back then I'd get nexted.
But now I'm so hot that I'm screaming I'm the bestest.
I had to steal this beat that Mr. West did.
Cause when I'm in the booth I get so reckless.
Tell me where my check is.
I get paper.
Say you found your next chic.
You're in danger.
I don't get rejected.
I get savored.
Gone and put your hands up in the ayer.
Get jiggy wit it.
You look like Ms. Piggy get it.
You fat and a fucking midget.
That's why you don't get no digits.
I get the digits on command.
Look at all this money in my muthafucking hand.
This ain't no sad ass song.
Just a sad ass beat.
I live in Westville but you live on a sad ass street.
You got your outfit looking like a tragedy.
My outfit look like it came out a magazine.
I don't be with broke bitches that's raggedy.
I only be with fly bitches, fat ass, tight jeans.
Don't pop my pussy for niggas that ain't earn it.
Rap it up real tight, that nigga could be burnin.
He was blazin, Asain, Jamaican and German.
I'm amzazing at taking it, I don't be squirming.
I just go to my hairdresser to put my perm in.
And the price not high like the top of Mount Vernon.
Yeah, welcome to my life.
I'm cooler than a fan.
I'm sharper than a knife.
