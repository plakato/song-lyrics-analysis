Information First Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

World games.
On the screen.
All eyes on line.
Preset fantasy.
No more romance.

Talking.
Watching.
Modern expression.
Closer we'll find.

Only know you could be beautiful.
We're so near apart.
Touch your TV feeling just the same.
You're my information first.

K.C. ask me why.
Pass me by.
No emotion calls.
Anonymous love.

Talking.
Watching.
Modern expression.
Closer we'll find.

Only know you could be beautiful.
We're so near apart.
Touch your TV feeling just the same.
You're my information first.

Only know you could be beautiful.
We're so near apart.
Touch your TV feeling just the same.
You're my information first.

Talking.
Watching.
Modern expression.
Closer we'll find.

Only know you could be beautiful.
We're so near apart.
Touch your TV feeling just the same.
You're my information first.

Only know you could be beautiful.
Only know you could be beautiful.
