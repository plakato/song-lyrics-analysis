Bad Ass Yella Boy Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..

Words like boy what is you doin' you created that shit.

Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
You crazy because my baby ain't.
Just a Lil' bad Ass yellow boy.
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
You crazy because my baby ain't.
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.

{Yella Boy}.

Causin' my trouble seven days a week.
Mami couldn't find a nice neighbor just to watch me.
Them people round the corner talkin' bout I'm just to wild.
Grownups on my back bout they can never change my style.
Ya said at a young age a nigga couldn't fuck.
I'm peepin' out the girlie's up the block to get my dick sucked.
Now I'm a hit the rope for three days that's the word.
Call my aunti will you watch him he ain't workin' on my nerves.
So I'm stuck with my mama bout to jet straight out of town.
I was waitin' on a greyhound so you know I had to clown.
Yes I'm array array oh it's late time to catch some Z's.
Greyhound number seven all you heard was quiet please.
Just diggin' around the luggage hopin' I can find a gangster gun.
Suck my dick I'm havin' fun.
But all my life I wonder if a nigga just behave they said.

Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
You crazy because my baby ain't.
Just a Lil' bad Ass yellow boy.
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
You crazy because my baby ain't.
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.

{Yella Boy}.

Now I reached double figures and I'm at the age of twelve.
You can never beat my talent so bitch don't tell me to go to hell.
I'm just a young and hard menace drivin' everything in site.
If you got a lil' bet tell that sucker I want a bite.
I went to Cargo Loofa with the polo and the jeans.
Couldn't be no fuckin' hoe you had to strap to see this dick.
Much trouble mo trouble that's all a lil' one know.
It will never ever stop me and that's another thing I know.
For all my life I always wonder what it meant to behave they said.

Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
You crazy because my baby ain't.
Just a Lil' bad Ass yellow boy.
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
You crazy because my baby ain't.
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.

{Yella Boy}.

A nigga is much older they got someone to content me.
But I like just like that while respect you know I'm kickin' it.
It was ruff back in the days I learned my fuckin' lesson.
I went to jail as a juvie I caught with Smith and Wesson.
Now have you heard that sayin' it'll be greater later.
I know that sayin' true because I got Mannie on the turn table.
I had to stop bein' a clown had to turn my life around.
Signed with cash money you know the U is never goin' down.
Still causin' trouble but this time it's done the right way.
Rippin' the fuckin' mic up all you suckers better make way.
I'm mad as a muthafucker in this bitch to win it.
My pockets is gettin' bigger and this only the begin'.
All my life I wonder what it was to behave they said.

Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
You crazy because my baby ain't.
Just a Lil' bad Ass yellow boy.
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
You crazy because my baby ain't.
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy.
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.

When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble.
