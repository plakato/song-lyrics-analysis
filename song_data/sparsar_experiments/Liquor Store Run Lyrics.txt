Liquor Store Run Lyrics
by Volume 10.


It's goin down, liqour store.
Must go down, goin down.

Bouncin to the liquor store.
Bout to purchase me a forty-O.
Liquorice types, bootleg tape.
Hat off the rack, battery for my DAT.
Bill, blowin me up, Holly go and say the limo pickin me up.
Now I got the plans, the freaky fans, finishin up.
The wash, the wax, the chrome on my *?doc-top ride?*.
Oh you know, we just, hangin.
Niggas hit me up, paintin my fingers from all this star bang-in.
Men-tal on the ward, give someone a gun.
Pull out a philly and he can pack himself.
????? ????? and J-Dub shootin dice with the rest of the brothers.
But I'm on TV breakin y'all motherfuckers.
E'rybody gonna get some of that light.
When they mobbin to the liqour store.

Everybody's gotta get some light.

Liquor store run, liqour store run, liqour store run.

Yeah.
But I ain't even there yet.
Cos there's still some more spots I'm gonna hit.
Like that brick house on the corner, I've been lovin it a long time.
????? my son and daughter but the sushi all mine.
And I'm almost to her house and thangs.
Seen em, chasin em, Lil' Jase servin em *?tump?*.
Hey, I know I'm gettin closer.
Peepin the homies, y'all sellin dope.
And all of my pimp and hustlers.
Yeah, waddup?
How bout lettin me hit those skins and then I'm gonna cut.
I'm on my way to your mom's store, I gotta show.
And me and Miss Sushi, 'ock you out about the dizzough.
Sun is beaming, '96 summer.
Aiyo Freeze, you got the beamer and my Camo.
Aight you motherfuckers, everybody, gonna get some of that light.
When they mobbin to the liquor store.

In the liquor store.
Now I done purchased me a forty-O.
Liquorice types, bootleg tapes.
Hat off the rack, battery for my DAT.
Vigo, fill some more, by the bread rack.
My persona out the door, my ????? in Prada wanna grab her a gat.
But e'rybody gonna get some of that light.
When they look in the liqour store.
For the sure dough, double-stitched, sock.
For the real neat team, never forgettin its knots.
Hops, we be on some ol' hacknin, a whole packet of rubbers.
And a video never play me unless it's murder.
You got my skrilla, but shit I want all the shit.
I don't know about my homies, maybe them fools is been.
1-2 all the way out to 10.
We had their back, that doesn't mean no loss.
Somebody bout to set it off again.

Everybody's gotta get some light.

Liquor store run, liqour store run, liqour store run.
