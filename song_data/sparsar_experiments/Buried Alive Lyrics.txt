Buried Alive Lyrics
by Antonym.


Once a name slips and bullshit tips off everybody.
All the ears poke up faster than the police in the lobby.
Rapanese ain't no hobby.
I spoke Japanese until the land of the snobby.
Picked me up softly.
Free my masterful mind like Harry did to Dobby.
If not bomb Abu Dhabi.
Go crazy like Busey.
Two Uzis shoot me and my tapes.
Up the gates of gods face.
So he can whisper me something enlightening.
Give me powers with lighting.
So I can go fighting the people. The evil.
Open jaws and wide eyes to my stunts like I'm the brand new Knievel.

These other stunt doubles stuck in their times.
I'm going back to medieval.
Put the needle from the record player to my vein.
The insane city of love.
Courtney kinda love didn't live up to its name.
Just a place for masked people to hide their pain.
Discretly bidding on how they got it worst.
And years from now they'll all know but I knew first.
I'm the first in the hearse to go.
Barry me quick in the snow I'd be first to blow.
Not like how you or your friends think you know.
How the girls that are around us.
Decided how to go about.
The teenage route to adultery or so, for sho.
But my blow will not be meaningless.
My blow won't be meaningless.
This is oral rape to the apes of the rap jungle.
No homo to the Homo sapiens, that's my uncle.
So get on your knees and say uncle.

Uncle.

Got off track, Torture.
Lock me up in this pine box.
Just make sure I got a spare key for the lock.
Incase what I'm saying doesn't really knock.
The heads off of the critiquing listeners.
An old girl gonna put this antique bliss in her.
It's for sure, don't burry me alive in the coffin.
Not til I'm about to die, through up and stop coughin'.
Look at me in the eyes, for once it's not often.
That a independent rapper doesn't get locked in.

I will try and not get locked in.
