Gotta Leave Lyrics
by 702.

You got me pullin' my hair.
From all your fussin' &amp; fightin'.
&amp; you came into my heart.
&amp; you was not invited.
Boy who you think you are.
With no invitation.
I heard about boys like you.
I just didn't know what I was facin'.
What's your occupation.

Why you ruinin' me.
Why you do, why you do.
These things to me.
Who are you, who are you.
You're bein' mean to me.
I gotta go.
Gotta leave.
Why you do it to me.

Now I'm too young to be stressed out.
But you don't know what I'm feelin'.
Boy I done had it with you.
I had it up to the ceilin'.
Had it up, had it up, had it up.
I tried to work it out.
But I can't deal with a heartache.
I know 'bout boys like you.
&amp; you learn from your mistake.
&amp; you was a mistake.

Why you ruinin' me.
Why you do, why you do.
These things to me.
Who are you, who are you.
You're bein' mean to me.
I gotta go.
Gotta leave.
Why you do it to me.

You must get out.
Hold up.
Wait a minute.
You could prevent it.
I know what you are all about.
I knew from the beginnin'.
So I guess now you're finished.

You must get out.
Hold up.
Wait a minute.
You could prevent it.
I know what you are all about.
I knew from the beginnin'.
So I guess now you're finished.

Why you ruinin' me.
Why you do, why you do.
These things to me.
Who are you, who are you.
You're bein' mean to me.
I gotta go.
Gotta leave.
Why you do it to me.
