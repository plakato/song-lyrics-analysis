Can I Get an Amen? - Season 5 Drag Race Lyrics
by RuPaul.


Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
Say amen.

Coco Montrese.
I lost all hope today:.
My car broke down -.
I'm empty.
So I went to a friendly bar.
There was a show.
This one's different....
Alyssa Edwards.
Lost and confused.
I had to smile from within.
When I realized these women were men!

Jade Jolie.
Your beard grew back again?
Girl, that's ok -.
Just keep shaving!
Ivy Winters.
All your dreams in front of you....
Just don't sashay;.
Jade + Jinkx + Ivy.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Don't let the weight of the world.
Flatten your weave -.
Just tease it, I'll turn Adam to Eve....

Roxxxy.
When life pulls you down.
Put on a shiny sequence gown.
Detox.
If you can get a gig.
Go buy yourself a lace-front wig.
Alaska.
Just tuck your junk and hit that runway.
Roxxy + Detox + Alaska.
It'll get better someday.

Can I get an amen?

Can I get an amen?

If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen?

Can I get an amen?

If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else ?
A-Amen.

Can I get an amen?

If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen?
A-AMEN!
