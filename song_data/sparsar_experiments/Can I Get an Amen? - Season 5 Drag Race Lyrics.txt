Can I Get an Amen? - Season 5 Drag Race Lyrics
by RuPaul.


Can I get an amen 
Can, I get an amen 
If. You can't love yourself 
How in the hell you gon na love, somebody else, 
Say, amen, 
, 
Coco, Montrese, 
I lost all hope. Today, 
My car broke down 
I'm empty 
So. I went to a friendly bar 
There was a show 
This one's different ... 
Alyssa, Edwards 
Lost and confused 
I had to smile from within 
When. I realized these women were men, 
 
Jade, Jolie 
Your beard grew back again: 
Girl. That'S ok, 
Just keep shaving 
Ivy Winters 
All! Your dreams in front of you, ... 
Just, don't sashay
