The Vehicle Is Invisible Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Rabbit we were younger.
We were older.
We were foolishly cool.
But discomposed.

Unsung is the way.
Slowly to disclaim.
I'll stand ready just don't be confused.
Mountain brings forth a mouse.

Much cry and little wool.
Anomalous.
We're not just usual.
It comes in the way i stand.
A stabbing wound.

It stung.
All i do is try to move on and on.
It's tearing the heart out of you.

Rabbit i've become wrong.
See i dwell on, deluded.
Thinking that i'm strong.
