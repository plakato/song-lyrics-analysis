Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing Lyrics
by Queen Kwong.

Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.

You ever love someone so much.
You thought your little heart was gonna break in two?

You ever try with all your heart and soul to get your lover back to you?

You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch me walk away.
?

Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
Baby did a bad bad thing, and I feel like dying, I feel like dying.

You ever toss and turn, you're lying awake and thinking about the one you.
love?

You ever close your eyes, you're making believe you're holding the one you're.
dreaming of?
Well if you say so.
I know it hurts so bad to finally know just how low, low, low, low I'll go.

Baby did a bad bad thing.
