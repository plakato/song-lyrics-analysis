\Stoop Kid\ Lyrics
by TwonDon.


Check it Seen dealers peddling, but I keep on peddling/ 
Cause meddling that'll can get you one in your melon'n/ 
Leave skeletons and bones. Nigga, stick to your own/ 
My step. Pops sat me down said dumb it down, for they domes/ 
But, never holmes. I do it. So the wheels can be chrome/. 
And Momma told me that these 16's, better cop, her a home/ 
Said, nigga name it Crack Coke or Dope. My niggas slanged it/ 
They, know it's two options. You keep the stainless or the pavement/ 
No witnesses said we closed our eyes. Mind our businesses/ 
Cause niggas pump iron and keep it by em like it's fitnesses/ 
Don't, be a victim. Kid stay in your lane/ 
I found mine. Just in time now I'm sharing my pain/ 
A nigga lucked up sip Mo' until Im fucked up/ 
Cause. If I don't coming out your throat, gon get you fucked up, / 
Said nigga, what / 
Jumped off the porch
