\Stoop Kid\ Lyrics
by TwonDon.


Check it - Seen dealers peddling but I keep on peddling/.
Cause meddling, that'll can get you one in your melon'n/.
Leave skeletons and bones, nigga stick to your own/.
My step pops sat me down said dumb it down for they domes/.
But never holmes, I do it so the wheels can be chrome/.
And Momma told me that these 16's better cop her a home/.
Said nigga name it: Crack, Coke, or Dope my niggas slanged it/.
They know it's two options you keep the stainless or the pavement/.
No witnesses, said we closed our eyes mind our businesses/.
Cause niggas pump iron and keep it by em like it's fitnesses/.
Don't be a victim kid stay in your lane/.
I found mine just in time now I'm sharing my pain/.
A nigga lucked up, sip Mo' until Im fucked up/.
Cause if I don't - coming out your throat gon get you fucked up!/.
Said nigga what?/.
Jumped off the porch &amp; I ran them streets/.
A product of my environment homie ain't shit sweet, nigga/.

And if I die, Before I wake make sure my mother paid and ain't cursed by my.
wicked ways/.
And if I die, before I wake make sure my family straight and always got a.
place to stay/ x2.

Said fuck school what I'm going for?/.
Looked up to dealers with skrilla driving beamers with no diploma dog/.
They future felons but to me they excelling/.
Some niggas pray for that dollar, you fold your hands for that blessing/.
I did em both - cause coppin' jesus pieces leave ya broke/.
Brother gave me dice said Roll these when ya pockets gettin' low/.
So we - rolling for rollies but that's out of the reach/.
I had enough for some puff and some all white sneaks/.
And sorry momma, I know that last line gon' be drama/.
Said I kinda dabbled in teen spirit but no Nirvana - haha/.
I thank momma, my hustle it came from ya/.
You let me follow dreams so plead I ain't gonna/.
For this fortune, gotta nigga driving with caution/.
I get it all break it down you get a proportion/.
Cause it's often - niggas like us is left orphans/.
Gotta make you proud cause you skip that abortion, straight up/.

I'm sorry momma for putting you through this shit/.
I should've finished college momma I know that you think I quit/.
But see I never quit on nothin' - I'm living I'm thinking big/.
I'm bigger than big, I figured you dig but you didn't/.
I zigged and I zagged, tryna find my path/.
Weed in a zig zag that grade A shit a make you laugh like Sinbad/.
With no job and no degree I needed to laugh/.
So I lean back like I'm laying in bath and I cleaned up my act/.
What! I hit the stu every night &amp; if I didn't I write/.
I dropped some friends I don't like, I was fresh just despite/.
Started learning and started clicking my girl stop bitchin'/.
I stopped cheatin' dropped the coke now my career is fizzing/.
Dibble dabbles with death while I'm dabbing the best/.
Wax you can find, my homies got it on deck - bottles on deck/.
I got some hits, Like Matty Kemp and I promise you momma/.
This shit'll get me paid I be the man since your daddy left/.
Rest In Peace Pop Pop/.
