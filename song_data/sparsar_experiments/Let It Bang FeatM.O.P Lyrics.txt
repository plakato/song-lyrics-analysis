OH! OH! OH! OH! Yeah.. cheese nigga!
One time, First Family.

Yo, I'm from a hellholee where male role models.
Live in bottles.
And a nigga first love is a drug.
We all fascinated by thug activity, street life.
Liberty.
Whole ghetto remedy, toss 'em a slug.
It's the untameable, nonflammable.
Unrestrainable, nonchangeable M.O.P.!
From the dark side my family provide knowledge.
To determine if niggas like you can live or die.
On the street.

This is recreational wreck to keep y'all illin.
Sound off, pump rounds off rock like Bob Dylan.
Would.
One-million and one guns, one-million and one.
Sons.
Cap pealin put two in your lungs, BLUM! BLUM!
It's the world's most amaaazing.
Blazing  DAMN! DAMN! DAMN!
Critically acclaimed criminals to blame.
Put 'em in critical condition, f**kin with Lil'.
Fame.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! {'Holdin it down'}.
If you wanna be hard rocks, c'mon - LET IT BANG!
{'Holdin it down'}.
If it's hits you want, hit 'em; yeah - LET IT.
BANG!

{'Holdin it down'}.

You see it! Say what? - LET IT BANG!
{'Holdin it down'}.
Step in the ring and I'll break yo' ass off - LET.

OH! OH! OH! oh OH! oh OH! oh OH! oh OH! oh.
OH! oh OH! oh OH! oh OH! oh OH! oh AAAAHHHHHHHHH!

Hey yo this shit is real blown out, allow me to.
Pull my chrome out.
And push pieces of your dome out.
So now  you see +Tomorrow Never Dies+.
Cries.
Yeah, but it's on back blocks, imbedded in some.
Blacktop.
And now, they wonder why we move the way we move.
and whadda we have.
To prove?
Nothin!  we're survivors.
Show me a man that's live, I'll show you Danze is.
Liver.
LET IT BANG!

{*scratches*}.
'You know I bring it to you live'.
'You've heard of us, official  murderous'.

'The X-Men' - 'comes equipped'.
'It ain't no shame in our game, we do our thing'.
LET IT BANG!

Who wanna test me now?
Cops wanna arrest me now, killers wanna stretch.
Me now.
Tear up and crush me now.
I'll bring it to your door, UPS style dressed in.
Brown.
Walt skully hat, cover my eyelashes.
Y-2-K what now? I'ma die blastin.
Open up your back like a wide out.
Spitty spittin the lead until it knock your.
Insides right out.

Roc-o OH! Roc-o, nigga, nigga LET IT BANG.
