Anthony Lyrics
by Russian Red.

And I put my hands up.
A drink from the same bottle that he does.
Just to impress him.
I dress myself in some italian vibe.
And he's still not tempted.
He dressed his head so elegantly now.
And his eyes in wonder.
Trying to find how fast he goes.
Counting down the moments.
Till I find myself in yours.
Youngsters are like monsters.
And we think no tries at all.
Cause we are never fearful.
And we'll live like there's no life.
Just counting down the moments.
Till we find.
And he's closing his eyes.
To over darkness, thus to see.
And closes his arms.
To the adventure, his alter reach.
And he talks sweetly.
Remember he's all carpentry and bees.
And there's nothing, nothing.
That could welcome stay the mind through reach.
Nothing that could welcome stay the mind through reason.
And there's nothing that could welcome stay the mind through reason.
Counting down the moments.
Till I find myself in yours.
Youngsters are like monsters.
And we think no tries at all.
Cause we are never fearful.
And we'll live like there's no life.
Just counting down the moments.
Till we find.
Nothing that couldn't couldn't lies.
And there is nothing that couldn't couldn't lies.
And there is nothing that couldn't couldn't lies.
Nothing.
