Nefarious Lyrics
by X-Raided  (a.k.a. Nefarious).

X-Raided talking.
X-raided locc back in the house.
My nigga Big Country.
Motherfucking mafia...hah, it's going down.

His name is Nefarious...haha.
Fin to break this shit down for you.
My motherfucking nigga Isosolis.
And we do it like this...yeah.

It's the same old shit everywhere I look.
Death and destruction, killing over nothin.
I know I made a contribution.
But in the ghetto ain't no motherfucking constitution.
Niggas be shooting everything that don't look right.
And if you got an attitude you'll catch a ghetto flight.
The jaws of life can't save you when we crush ya.
I can't trust ya cause the homie told me you a busta.
And motherfuckers hate to see a nigga having thangs.
You think I'm jokin, but I don't see nobody laughing kid.
I want to go AWOL like a prison riot.
And if a gaurd try's to stop me then thats his mistake.
Think I'm a fake I'll brake you off somthing serious.
It used to be X-Raided now it's Nefarious.
It's very rough, cause ain't no other way for me to come.
Them AWOL motherfucking niggas on the run.

X-Raided is Nefarious; the D.A. said so.
Told the jury he's crazy, you can't let him go.
And Castro had my back to a certain extent.
But they still didn't find a nigga innocent.

Don't repent now.
Change your ways cause you went to jail.
You say your silent but motherfucker how can I tell.
I ain't following no rules, I'm a rebel y'all.
I didn't come to the pen and stop breaking laws.
I smoke weed with the homie when he first get in.
And in the visiting booth, my mocha give me head.
In the county jail I had a walkman and tape.
Bitches playing with they pussy's in the visit tank.
Rubbin on that clitoris while I'm sitting there staring like a motherfuck.
Thinking bout to bust it.
You niggas knowin it's the truth.
Have the cops on the payroll lettin a nigga do what he wanna do.
Get your door popped if I want to get that ass.
Get in the visiting booth, and then my mocha pass.
Me a bag of the greens.
And I stay high five west three thirteen.

The mornig after.
Sitting in my cell.
The jury found me guilty.
No tears in my eyes, no suprise can you feel me.
It was anticipation.
The media had me guilty with no deliberation.
But only ho's break down when it gets rough.
I lost a bomb bitch, she said she had enough.
My mocha told me baby boy, I got your back.
So far so good , but I can't believe none of that.
Time to tell the story better than I ever could.
I say I wouldn't give a fuck, but I bet I would.
Yet I refuse to beg a bitch to stay with me.
If she want to go, then I'ma let her leave.
In the pen it's kinda hard to keep your girl happy.
My homie lost his lady to a dyke named Betty.
Nappy hair, nappy chin like Ice Cube.
And I refuse to lose.

Yeah....
What....
What....
Yeah...1-8-7 on the D.A.
He ain't tryin to give a young black nigga no leeway.
Yes, yes y'all 1-8-7 on the whole court room motherfuck them all.
1-8-7 on the D.A.
He ain't tryin to give a young motherfucker no leeway.
Yes, yes y'all 1-8-7 on the whole court room motherfuck them all.
The Nefarious...X-Raided in the motherfucking house.
The Nefarious...yeah...bitch.
Big Country whats up locc...yeah, it's going down in a real way.
