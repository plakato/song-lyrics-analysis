Badu Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


Go against the Uth's foolish, don't do this.
Move, don't spit in my presence.
Add up my weapons, got.
Campus' and towns locked down.
Government status, out of habit.
With caskets matted 8 feet for the masses.
Tragic for these ABC rhymers.
Lead up's and punch liners.
I'm finding it ironic with ebonics.
Chronic emcees can't achieve.
Honestly, no competition when I'm mentioned.
It's business.
I'll rectify their minds, in time they're risen.
But they're driven.
To what's hot like Bugatti engines.
Got parties claiming they're thinking sharply with 3rd eye visions.
If it's reigning true, then this ain't aimed at you.
It's for the ones that take that concept and they run.
The Native Tongues should be ashamed of you.
Nothing to the cause, the Zulu Nation is appalled.
Peace to the Gods in charge.
Pull their card, dog, they're frauds.
Sat back, let them rap on my field.
But it's a skill, and missed grapples were the deal.
So now they're playing my squad.

One day, all them bags gon' get in your way 2x.
I said...

Niggas acting like they shouldn't know.
Wouldn't know, delusional.
If they thinking niggas wasn't 'bout to blow.
Now here we go.
For my team I'm Tom Brady mixed with Tracy McGrady.
Keep an eye out, so play shady.
Watch how slim get crazy.
Said it's the 5'9 ill nigga.
Seen vintage Tommy Hilfiger.
Got me feeling oh so comfy.
Understand that women love me.
Telling me they wanna fuck me.
And they say I'm lso lucky.
Cause they usually not this kinda girl.
Never been inside this kinda world.
And I don't want no babies.
So you know I stay wit condoms girl.
Deadly the disease.
Make a instrumental freeze.
You can open doors with keys.
Well the pump busted it with ease, peacefully.
Now bitch don't speak to me.
Groupie bitches infatuated with our higher living.
Doom centered, I'm a cold MF'er.
Middle fingers when I txt her.
Madvillainy.
Wanna kill off my family like the Kennedy's.

King poetic, too much flavor I'm major.
Few gon' get it, too much layers for majors.
Listen to our music on blast.
While sittin in class.
Given we the wickedest clash, since the British band.
Kid isn't average.
Grip steel and get active.
Pealing they caps and flip they duckbills backwards.
Your mind's captive.
Mine's riding the passage, and doin backflips.
Ain't impressed by stacked cabbage.
Sad but it's true.
Baddest crew, had to be Uth.
Don't get embarrassed by the masses cause you had to be cool.
And don't be carried in a casket just for acting a fool.
Passionate so I picked grabbing Macs over grabbing a tool.
I'm out for capitol and advancing the spans of your mind.
Expanding my time, using the only eye that's divine.
Let's murk the Capitol and laugh in they face when they ask why.
I'm surprised we let so many attacks just pass by.
It's sad but you can't cry homie.
I'll be fine, as long as I got my lines on me.
I'll do that time.
If a military draft catch me, imma be locked then.
Uth youngin with locks, rare for me finding cop friends.

So if I toss a Molotov then we start a revolution, right.
Light this bitch up.
Yeah you fuckin' with the Uth tonight.
No more hands outs, you fuckin' with the champs now.
How we stand out is like a group clowns in a bland crowd.
Working since the birth of this.
We sound the way they can't sound.
If we catch them with that ran mouth.
Then it's man down.
So if you planning on talking shit, you should stand down.
Same shit, we been about sounding like fads.
Now we 'bout that.
We down under like outback.
Where your mouth at.
Catch it running, don't get off track.
The Uth coming soon.
So make room for the hottest collective.
Make our own shit, so you gotta respect us.

You are now a witness.
To the Uth's reentrance to the rap game.
So please just listen.
Get ready to hear vengeance.
Took a break, boy, but now I'm back at it.
Dammit I still got it.
Living lavish ,slinging veggies.
Just to increase my cabbage.
My girl cute in the face, and her ass is the fattest.
And when she ready come get it baby I let you have it.
Smoking strains, that'll have your ass on another planet.
And contrary to popular belief.
We refuse to make trap rap to get hot in the streets.
We underground with it.
That shit that will make ya think.
More substance than sound, ya hear me.
You'll miss something if you blink.
Dropping jewels my nigga.
3rdiii be the missing link.
And if you can my nigga.
Don't ever step to the team.
You gon' get yammed my nigga.
Fuck 12, they can catch me if they can my nigga.
I'm the man nigga.
With the plan my nigga!

No subtweeting.
My sleeping is uneven.
Don't preach when the one's speaking.
Or creeping on one's features.
Blunt in between my pointer and thumb.
Can't deny, it's implied.
We the glorious ones.
Got a mountain view.
I'm looking from the shore to the sun.
Smoking dope because the struggle weighing more than a ton.
Medicated, and heavily meditated.
That gold piece on my wrist is a result from hella payment.
If it is important to you.
My nigga, you better say it.
Or get caught in the mist.
Cause the Nimbus is better faded.
This is for all my niggas who hustle.
But never made it.
And all the ones creative, but heavily regulated.
This heavy metal, Megatron.
Hustling 'til I'm dead and gone.
Put it on my soul.
That you haters can't make a better song.
Smooth as ever.
Cause the dude is leather.
Lets get high, and find some shit we can do together.
Uth.
