Crown Royal Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

D.M.C. 
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.. 
 
The king's a ruler, the ruler rules, 
The king's, a ruler, the ruler rules, 
The king-the king's, a ruler, the ruler rules, 
The king's, a ruler, the ruler rules, 
 
Run 
I'm, the epitome of Royalty, you versus me is a joke: 
I'm, a rage and major blaze. You cigarette smoke, 
Your video's number one, and that was part of our plan. 
Went from Rock Box to a whole countdown jam, 
Took rock music switched it and flipped it and made it raw 
Anywhere. You played, we played it before in eighty-four, 
Every show a hundred thousand people or more 
Fame'll still give us tours, and we be tryin not to take'em all 
I bake'em, all quicker than Sara Lee. Come battle me 
Imagine that what a site that'll be 
Front page of the Times I can read the headlines now. 
Rev. Run beat clown down for tryin to take his crown 
 
Run 
I'm, the reason you started: rhymin 
I'm the reason rap sales started: climbin 
That's. Why? I'M still headlinin 
I'm the king and before I stop y'all cats, gon' learn 
Yeah y'all niggas wan na burn. Wait your turn, 
Run, I'm a living legend. My suggestion is: learn your lesson. 
I leave you stressin confessin and strivin for blessing 
And. Whatever your impression it better. Be that we, the top pedigree 
Bringin y'all enegry since eighty-three 
I, run this here since way back when 
I pick up a pair of shells and make y'all wear'em again 
If, you thought it I done. Did it 
Heard it? I done spit it. 
New cats wan na pay their respects, then son, I'm with it 
But, if not I'ma, reclaim the top of the charts. 
Doin shows for dough flows rip'em apart 
Other than that I'll just be holdin. My own 
Crown Royalty up on the throne, f'real 
, 
D.M.C., 
Our father, who art in heaven 
Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy, will be done. Forever..
