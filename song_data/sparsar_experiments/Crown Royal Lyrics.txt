Crown Royal Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

D.M.C..
For thine, is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever...

The king's a ruler, the ruler rules.
The king's a ruler, the ruler rules.
The king-the king's a ruler, the ruler rules.
The king's a ruler, the ruler rules.

Run.
I'm the epitome of royalty, you versus me is a joke.
I'm a rage and major blaze, you cigarette smoke.
Your video's number one and that was part of our plan.
Went from Rock Box to a whole countdown jam.
Took rock music, switched it and flipped it and made it raw.
Anywhere you played, we played it before in eighty-four.
Every show, a hundred thousand people or more.
Fame'll still give us tours and we be tryin not to take 'em all.
I bake 'em all, quicker than Sara Lee, come battle me.
Imagine that, what a site that'll be.
Front page of the Times, I can read the headlines now.
Rev. Run beat clown down for tryin to take his crown.

Run.
I'm the reason you started rhymin.
I'm the reason rap sales started climbin.
That's why I'm still headlinin.
I'm the king and before I stop y'all cats gon' learn.
Yeah y'all niggas wanna burn wait your turn.
Run I'm a living legend, my suggestion is learn your lesson.
I leave you stressin confessin  and strivin for blessing.
And whatever your impression it better be, that we the top pedigree.
Bringin y'all enegry since eighty-three.
I run this here since way back when.
I pick up a pair of shells and make y'all wear 'em again.
If you thought it I done did it.
Heard it I done spit it.
New cats wanna pay their respects then son I'm with it.
But if not, I'ma reclaim the top of the charts.
Doin shows for dough flows rip 'em apart.
Other than that, I'll just be holdin my own.
Crown Royalty, up on the throne, f'real.

D.M.C..
Our father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, forever...
