Phoenix Lyrics
by Wrathschild.


Hide away.
Cause if I ever see your face again.
I won't be shy.
I'll make you watch until you cry.

I'm gonna make you wish you never walked away-ay-ay.
I'm gonna make you, make you, make you.
Make you wish you stayed.
Delete my number cause I'm blocking all your ca-a-alls.
You know, you know, you know we could have had it a-a-all.

Your heart is like a machine.
You pull the plug on me.
You'd thought I'd die, but you set me free.
Like a phoenix arise, make you wish you could fly-y-y-y.
Now watch me go.

Drop.
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

How does it feel.
To know I'm happy when you're not around?
I left your bed.
Now there's nowhere left to hold me down.

I'm gonna go in the dark.
Resurrect my heart.
And so I'm going to.
Dance in the fire.

Hide away, now watch me, watch me.
Hide away, now watch me.
