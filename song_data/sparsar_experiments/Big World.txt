Big World
by WordPlay T.JAY.


I'm sick of being sick, tired of being tired.
But I'm still inspired, to try and be admired.
Small town where nobody ever stops.
I seen a big world, within a Little Rock.

Where nobody understands, see a bigger plot.
Even just to be a man you gotta hug the block.
But you're stuck up in a place where they don't hug a lot.
Facing a big world, holding a little rock.

But you gotta sell it, or either smoke a bit.
Either way you're just staring at a deficit.
Hoping she takes you there just to get you hot.
She in a big world, but wants a little rock.

Daddy's down the street, there ain't enough to eat.
Hate to go to bed hungry but I'm feeling weak.
Maybe this bread will hold me down til it's six o'clock.
I need a big world. He sells a little rock.

A little Rock....
And even if it stood still I'd never stop.
Live in a big world, but still a little rock.

I'm sick of being sick, tired of being tired.
Spent a couple thousand days just to be admired.
Wrote a song a dumbed it down just so I could pop.
Wanted a big world, but on a little rock.

Writing everyday, I'm living through the pain.
No one can do it for me, I got no one to blame.
In my own imagination sitting near the top.
I know a big world, but through a little rock.

On a steady climb, look how far I got.
See me battle through the wounds, see me pick the clots.
To every gatekeeper watch me break the locks.
We're in a big world, but still a little rock.

And as I'm breaking through the door I'm the one to watch.
Only actors need attention I don't look for props.
Know exactly where I'm going ain't no time to stop.
Live in a big world, but from a Little Rock.
