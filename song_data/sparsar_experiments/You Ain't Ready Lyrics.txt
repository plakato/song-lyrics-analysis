You Ain't Ready Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.

Lock and load, let's go nigga....

You ain't ready nigga, you ain't ready nigga.
You ain't ready, you don't know where you headed nigga.
You ain't ready nigga, you ain't ready fool.
You ain't ready nigga, dog we bout to take you.

D-Gotti.
Niggas get killed, over bullshit.
Me I'm riding one deep up on them thangs, so I'ma pull quick dog.
I'm a nigga out the gutter that ain't never had shit.
Baby bounce to the B-I be back move bricks.
Pulling all nighters with the hood hitting licks.
Whether this that man your dog getting rich.
These chicks need they bills paid, so where the ballers at.
I'm just a nigga out the gutter, trying to get off some crack.
This to my strippers and my pussy poppers, get money boo don't let nothing.
stop ya.
Head doctors break a nigga off proper, mixing in like you in a opera.
Papa was a playa fool, inhale crack smoke.

Whoa, the streets bout to see me for real.
I hope you ready for your present, dog the gift is here.

A3.
Niggas jump fly, with that funny bullshit.
But you better hit the deck, when the K start to spit.
Like up the boulevard, I ain't playing no games.
Me and my niggas, bout to bang your brains.
I love these streets, I eat these streets.
When the streets get cold, I heat these streets.
Move out the way, when that thang start to stutter.
Or find yourself sleeping, with the rats in the gutter.
Don't play with me dog, I ain't no toy.
Don't play with me dog, I ain't no boy.
Get me mixed up, in this rap shit what.
I'ma show you, how I cock back and cut.
Burn your ass, to the dirty third degree.
You better ask J.B., nigga leave us be.
I got the homie D-Reck, the boy ain't tripping.

It's like mirror mirror, on the wall.
Who is the gutterest, of them all.
Wreckshop trend setters, and see this how it be.
It's the Tanker slash captain, so niggas follow me.

Craig G.
Y'all motherfucking niggas, ain't ready.
I'm gripping the Glock I lick shots, leave em sizzling hot.
Guard your grill we be rushing em, slugs be busting em.
Picking em off, with the sawed off bucks touching em.
I'm a hood cat, straight from the gutter that's the hood black.
On point precise, bringing the spice with a hood gat.
Leaving em flat, my adrenaline rushing.
Ready to bust back, it continue when busting.
Issue concussions and flesh wounds, bitch niggas get wet fool.
You jump out of line, you gon get hit with that tech fool.
I bet ya, this motherfucking slug'll catch ya.
And heat your ass up, like a black and decker.
Test a young nigga, with that funny bullshit.
Leave you flat on your back, in front of the bull pit.
Full clip, you niggas ain't ready for G.
Get out my zone, cause you bitches ain't better than me.
