Majesty in Misery Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

Though all of us have gone our own way.
Though all of us have left and gone astray.
Left and gone astray.

The Savior restrained.
The King He was chained.
For a people of unclean lips.
With our hands blood stained.
For the sake of His glory and love His power abstained.

No rebellious cries with only love in His eyes.
He knew our sin meant His demise.
And as he walked in such grace.
In grief He fell on His face.
In light of all that He would embrace.

Distressed.
Until it was complete.
Distressed.
Till death had met defeat.

While never calling retreat.
Or even signaled defeat.
This work was not yet complete.
Despite the pain that'd ensue.
And of the torment He knew.
His face was set to see it through.

The Savior restrained.
The King He was chained.
For a people of unclean lips.
With our hands blood stained.
The Savior restrained.
The King He was chained.
For the sake of His glory and love.

Though all of us have gone our own way.
Though all of us have left and gone astray.

Cast down by wicked plans.
Tortured by our own hands.
Despised, deformed, disgraced.
Forgiving all He faced.

He was distressed until it finished.
The pain endured was not diminished.
Until the vict'ry's sound and was won.
“Not My will but Yours be done.”.

He drank it all, the cup of God's wrath.
He drank it down to the end.
He drank it all, the cup of God's wrath.
He drank it down to the bitter end.

You laid our wickedness on His head.
For all we've done and all that we've said.
He was crushed for our transgressions.
He was pierced for all our sins.
How could Your death mean that I live?
When it's my life that brought You death?
Oh God I truly give.
My beating heart and living breath.
