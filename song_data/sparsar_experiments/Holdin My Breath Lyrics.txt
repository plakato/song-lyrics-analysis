Holdin My Breath Lyrics
by 4th25.


I hold my tears till im underwater.
So yall don't never see me cryin.
Holdin my breath till I can resurface.
But I can feel myself dyin.

Too long without oxygen in my lungs.
Maybe im tired.
Maybe its time for me to breathe easy.
But I could never let you see me.

Give in to bein underfire.
No matter how short I breathe I get.
Cause to let it show is to let you know.
At times how weak I really get.

And im trying to be strong for the both of us.
Hold on for the both of us.
But how long can I hold by breathe.
For the both of us.

Its too much on my shoulders here.
And I just can't cope with it.
Knowin deaths round the corner.
And im standin so close to him.

Im supposed to show no emotion.
But its getting harder to focus.
Cause the reality of my life here.
Is that I have no control of it.

Feel the need to come up for air.
But with you there I must hold it.
And yeah I know how close I come everyday.
But I could never let you know it.

Its too much for you to feel my pain.
So I send you all smiles.
Holdin my breathe telling you its alright.
But the truth is im drownin.

Sample:.
“holdin my breath for you”.
“so you never see me crying”.

This is so close to bein over.
But we ain't left here yet.
And its been rainin the whole time.
But I managed to never get wet.

While those around me soaked.
From the moment the first convoy left.
But who knows cause the way things goin.
Any day now I could be next.

And I ain't trying to see yall back home.
With my problems on your chest.
So the truth evolves into what I think you need to hear.
Just to relax.

So for you im always at my best.
I continue to see clearly.
But I could never lie to myself.
And the truth is im more than a little worried.

But that part of my heart.
Stays closed when im on the phone with my family.
How can I expect them to handle something.
Im havin a hard time handling.

And as strong as I may be.
Can carry this weight forever.
Cause im fallin apart underneath it.
Trying to piece myself back together.

Hopin for the best.
But at times the worst seems to get the better of me.
So its everything I got not to let you see.
Whats really troubling me.

Can feel my lungs under pressure.
And they are beggin me to breathe.
But I can't, not with you standin there.
So I hold my breath till you leave.
