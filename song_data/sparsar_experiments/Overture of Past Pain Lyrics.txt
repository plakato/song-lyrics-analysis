Overture of Past Pain.
Produced by Vo-Kal.

Mr. Parker are you sleeping in my class?
Wake up you silly nigga.
Don't let all your dreams get past.
In school you barley passed and.
Staying single seemed to last.
But you keep getting trapped by these boobies.
Don't let your innocence get booby trapped.

That's when I wake up.
To the existence that I call reality.
One meal a day ends barely meet.
That's what I call my salary.
And damn shorty thick.
In that bang bros. gallery.
My mind's racing there faster.
The places getting more vast her.
Past sins on my mind but yet I.
Can't pass them up blinding.
Lights in my rear view.
Missing opportunities that's not new.
Just got through to my confidant.
Embarrassed to tell him new news.
Just got a feature instead.
He told me just to keep up my head.
My minds racing there faster.
The places getting more vast her.
Perfect body still on my mind.
Can I finally just get past her.
Master my feelings and future endeavors.
Both girls on my mind won't do nothing but failures.
That's why we wouldn't work out.
I got a life, deadlines to meet.
Final fantasy.
Just strategy on my mind.
That's just how it has to be.
Stay focused, straight path.
Stay firm in all of my beliefs.
I know when your lying.
But I seem to always just lie to me.
I can't lie to me.
Just don't lie to me.
I can take it.
But only lies lie that deep.
The truth hurts.
But ignorance is poison.
And betrayal is the reason that you lied to me.
But finally.
I'm confident in myself now.
Past those awkward moments.
When I bring myself down.
When I look in the mirror.
And see the man that I've become.
After all those years of self doubt.
My potential out weighted.
The possibilities.
Of they're hate.
Controlling my thoughts.
And now I need.
To free all of my thoughts.
And all of my inner demons.
That deemed my thoughts.
Dirty and out of sync.
Of society.
Maybe some mental dieting.
The deity that guided me.
God, the one that's beside of me.
Inspiration fighting for me.
All my fans that's fighting for me.
All my friends that's fighting for me.
All my family fighting for me.
But I'm the one I need to fight for.
I chose a path.
I hope I'm picking the right door.
I chose production.
I hope the beats on the right score.
And all my free time.
Is telling me I should write more.
It's never too late for now.
I still live it.
That 30 rock episode.
Reason I'm still in it.
A jack of all trades.
And a master of all.
But I can't find growth.
Until I capture my fall.
New girl on my mind.
But she been ignoring all of my calls.
It went so well at first.
But now she won't kiss me at all.
Maybe if I call her once more.
Or even show up at her door.
She'll start acting normal again.
And just fall into my arms.
