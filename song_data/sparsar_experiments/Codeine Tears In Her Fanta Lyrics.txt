Codeine Tears In Her Fanta Lyrics
by Black Kray.


Lean tears in her fanta when I met like why.
Barbie hummer, trap doin' numbers my whoadie, igh.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my soldiers cry.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my whoadie died.
Lean tears in her fanta when I met like why.
Barbie hummer, trap doin' numbers my whoadie, igh.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my soldiers cry.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my whoadie died.
Lean tears in her fanta when I met like why.

Diamonds color lean in the Fanta all in Atlanta.
Rich bitch drop top Beamer, I can't stand her.
Trap phone same color of Kane, still pourin' 4s.
Trap phone same color of Kane, still pourin' 4s.

Rich bitch, yellow Beamer when we ride, ride slow.
Smokin' on thoyoin when we go dumb, oh.
Dancin' with my shooters in the party, we goin' why.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my soldiers cry.

Lean tears in her fanta when I met like why.
Barbie hummer, trap doin' numbers my whoadie, ighh.
Barbie hummer, trap doin' numbers my whoadie, ighh.
Lean tears in her fanta when I met like why.
Lean tears in her fanta when I met like why.
Barbie hummer, trap doin' numbers my whoadie, ighh.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my soldiers cry.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my whoadie died.
Lean tears in her fanta when I met like why.
Barbie hummer, trap doin' numbers my whoadie, ighh.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my soldiers cry.
Throwin' 4s up in the sky, my whoadie died.
