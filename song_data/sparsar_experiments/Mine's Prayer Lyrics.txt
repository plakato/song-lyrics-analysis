Mine's Prayer Lyrics
by TyC // 95 KiD.


Mines Prayer.
Cowards got they heads seized in a nightmare.
Aight, there, dead MC's at times square.
Wondering who got MTVs mind there.
Taking your city like the shadows take light.
24 hours and the world is our night.
Hoping to be standing on stage after the fight.
Miss the crowd, cause they make me feel all-right.

I Turned to a sick, sick teen with lynguistic keen.
This shit mean, now check the method.
I bring madness, the dark art, the precious.
The style, I bring that shaolin flow, Though I Don't know.
How-men could get that low.
No harm though, How-thin you got to go?
No calm soul, How-can you act so cold.
You better go to the poles.
Might better use for you assholes.
I wish we had a world with no flagpoles.
Mad clothes, more soul, no drug addiction.
\- Less hoes, more goals, a young depiction of how it goes.
Cause what you listen to is analyzed.
They wrote the hieroglyphics â€“.
Others said they vandalized.
Coat your ego-physics, they break rules.
With any lies.
Vivid, this beast's in you.
You won't realize..

Mines Prayer.
Cowards got they heads seized in a nightmare.
Aight, there, dead MC's at times square.
Wondering who got MTVs mind there.
Taking your city like the shadows take light.
24 hours and the world is our night.
Hoping to be standing on stage after the fight.
Miss the crowd, cause they make me feel all-right.

Unleashed it will rise to size and prize doom.
It's that very little piece of your heart that is consumed.
In my eyes, life is the search of stability.
In my eyes, we're fools if we lack responsibility.
I really try to school, but nobody is feeling me.
They drool when you try to teach them soul-relativity.
Only cool for material facility, it's killing me.
The stool call earth equals humility.
None the less, still I craft jewels to infinity.
These diamonds shall shine way passed my quest, within-of-me.
Fien-to-be, lyrical master, in my inner me.
Energy got enemies outclassed, so the dinner be.
The trophy, kill the tiger in your vicinity, Or the bear.
No matter the beast, you know who the winner be.
A share, a feast, sacrifice for dignity.
And any price I had to pay is straight off to Italy.
Cold like the winter-be, magnetic like the moon.
Told y'all by the morning you're addicted, By the noon.
Assuming control of all life as such.
I'm just an MC who dun rolled too much.

Mines Prayer.
Cowards got they heads seized in a nightmare.
Aight, there, dead MC's at times square.
Wondering who got MTVs mind there.
Taking your city like the shadows take light.
24 hours and the world is our night.
Hoping to be standing on stage after the fight.
Miss the crowd, cause they make me feel all-right.
