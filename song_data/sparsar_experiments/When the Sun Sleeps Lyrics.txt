When the Sun Sleeps Lyrics
by Underoath.

I thought you'd come back at least I prayed, so I prayed.
The romance has been dead, the romance is dead, the romance is dead.
For years, you come back.
But I've been too afraid to dig the grave, so I prayed.
Relief support never came.

Memories carry me through the day.
Of when we were kids.
And angels came to watch us play.

Close my eyes just for tonight.
The sun still sleeps, and when she wakes.
Close my eyes just for tonight.
The sun still sleeps, and when she wakes.

A movie that plays in my mind.
Remembering you helps me survive.
Every day a re-run of the next.
I promised to stay by your side.
That all would change, I can't complain.
Another victim of the game.

Maybe love will find us again.
For there is always tomorrow.
Sincerely 'til the end.

You'll be a memory, be a memory.
You'll be a memory, be a memory.
You'll be a memory, be a memory.
You'll be a memory, be a memory.
You'll be a memory, memory, memory, memory.
