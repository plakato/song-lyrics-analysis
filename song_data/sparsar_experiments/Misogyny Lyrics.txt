Misogyny Lyrics
by Rusty.

He veers, she fears, he's comin' home to box her ears.

Upside-down.

Welfare, takes care, of all the women in his lair.

Upside-down.

And if you ask the cruellest soul, soul.

You can't expect him to be home, be home.

You'll always ask for one more try, try.

You'll always give him one more...

Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah!

She scrubs, he comes, she holds it in herself for months.

Upside-down.

He's bored, she scored, the blade has got a life that's torn.

Upside-down.

And if you ask the cruellest soul, soul.

You can't expect him to be home, be home.

You'll always ask for one more try, try.

You'll always give him one more.

Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah!

His bad luck, man it sucks, she's been impressed - who gives a fuck.

Upside-down.

She tired, growing tired, he's gonna rip her up inside.

Upside-down.

And if you ask the cruellest souls, soul.

You can't expect him to be home, be home.

You'll always ask for one more try, try.

You'll always give him one more.

Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah!

Upside-down.

And if you ask the cruellest soul, soul.

You can't expect him to be home, be home.

He'll always ask for one more, try, try.

He'll always give you one more try, try.

You'll always give him one more....

Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah.
