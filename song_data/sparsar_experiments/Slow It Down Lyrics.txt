Slow It Down Lyrics
by Tyler.


Ace, The Creator.
Hodgy Beats.
OF.

We come through throbbing like thunder storms.
Make their feets get wet and funky up in they under arms.
I'm too explosive for your ears like I'm throwing bombs.
With the exclusive on the channel, bitch I know it's on.
Niggas get mad like cheerleaders, they throw they pom-poms.
Suck a dick, eat salaam getting they nails done in salons.
Hodgy Beats is like lip balm.
If you talk shit, I'll make you cry and tell your big moms.
I got nice hands, niggas eat out my big palms.
Haters must be starving nowadays I make California Vietnam.
And I'm going to embalm my creativity.
Into a CD-ROM, so you can feel this shit I'm on.

Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, yeah.
Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, oh my God.
Turn it up nigga, where's the bass?
Could you bring the keys? Yeah.
Turn it up, nigga where's the bass?
Drop the drums.

Pink chinchilla,.
something like thrilla.
My t-shirts are bathing, a bathing gorilla.
You niggas all hype like you drink a cup of Splenda.
But I ate the whole plate like a fat bitch dinner.
I'm never the winner, always the loser.
I don't choose to win, but I will choose her.
Her kitty-cat fish loves his tuna.
I never use a fork I always spoon her.
Go nuts, instrumental.
flow much.
European model white bitch is eating donuts.
Fuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch.
Making shit come like I'm go-go gadget.
I'm mental, it's.
instrumental.
Make your bitches' therapist ask for dental records.
And I hope this record have you stabbing niggas with colored pencils.

Yo, bubble gum that.
Reese's Pieces.
You fail at life, I'll mug your teachers.
I've got Muslims calling on Jesus.
I fucked Kelly, where is Regis?
Found Alicia, now she keyless.
Cold as ice, and now I'm creamless.
Murdered every bod from my squad.
So technically, now I'm teamless, O.F. is so prestigious.
