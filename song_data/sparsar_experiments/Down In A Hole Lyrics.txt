Down In A Hole Lyrics
by Ruse.

I'll be the sunlight.
You be the rain in the sky.
I'll be correction.
You be mistakes from old times.
I'll be direction.
You be the broken down sign.
I'll be tomorrow.
But tomorrow we're old and gone.
Down in your hole.
You dig through the ground.
Your eyes like a mole.
You see with sound.
Oh no down in your hole.
You be the morning.
I'll be the night fall at nine.
You be solution.
I'll be distraction and lies.
You are tomorrow.
But tomorrow we're old and gone.
Down in your hole.
You dig through the ground.
Your eyes like a mole.
You see with sound.
Oh no down in your hole.
