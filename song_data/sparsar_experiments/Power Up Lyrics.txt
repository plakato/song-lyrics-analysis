Power Up Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.

Get your ass on the floor, it's going down!

Come on baby power up with me.
I just popped me an ecstasy.
Come on baby power up with me.
We shocking and a rocking to this melody.
One, two, ready or not.
Everybody's about to drop.
Uh huh three, four, five, six.
If you don't know girl work them hips.
Uh huh seven, eight, nine, ten.
If its kicking in well then you spinspin baby.

Um hold up, I'ma peel it, in pilly billy.
When I shoot two shops holla mayday mayday.
Today was payday and Dirty Third went nationwide.
Clover in my light got my jaws real tight.
Now uh, seein shit twice.
Yo it just kicked in I'm.
drinking O-J on ice.
Do-do intensifies the feeling.
And have me willing.
To go to game spitting.
At the baddest ? bitches.
May I mention, I feel like I can fly.
A magic old Southern night.
Trying to bring Sprite to some ho like.
I ain't searching for no broad.
But what it do tonight.
Here's a pill for your troubles.
Uh huh ho's like What up.

You see how a nigga be moving so slow mo.
On a double-stack XO.
About to snatch the next ho.
Don't act like you weren't struck when I entered the do'.
Lit the fuck up, lighted like a light show.
? and cranberry with.
my pilly kicking in.
Bout to hit the dance flo ?
It's on, playa give me ninety feet.
Cause if you give me fifty feet.
You gon still be in my reach.
You feel me peeps?
My mouth be so cold.
Uh, when I'm on XO.

I'm on three blue knights.
I'm on three blue knights.
We wreck this on three tool-as.
We wreck this on three tool-as.
And we fly like a kite.
And we fly like a kite.

Ain't it right tonight's the night.
Me and Derete' fight.
Washed it down with O-J on ice.
Ey yo Easy how you feeling my friend?
I'm feeling like we gotta grab gin and a twin.
D reezie how you feeling my nigga?
I'm explesive want to make a porno flick.
Now get naked.
I let it roll out and I don't pull a stunt.
I hit it from the back while I hit it from the front I give you them things.
What did you say Angela I got stamana.
For her and Pamela.
I ain't greety I ain't needy.
But both of us together make it twice as sleazy.
