An Elegy For Baby Blue Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

Fifteen past Midnight, on the west side.
We're dodging shady blocks like landmines.
Scum hides under streetlights.
And with gun in hand they caught me tonight.
We won't capsize in the meantime.
We won't break down; we'll be all right.
We'll just dust off and head back inside.
He didn't know it yet, man, but Dylan was right.

Because it's all over now Baby Blue.
It's like the world stopped revolving in the absence of you.
We'll stay bone dry despite the red eyes and long nights.
Nothing about you but your wheel's been anything but true.

Come on, man. You've been a good friend.
I had that dream where we found you again.
Come on, man. We didn't stand a chance.
It broke my heart to watch them ride you down Mifflin.
Sometimes, at night, I swear I hear you screaming.
No! No! Don't let me go....

It's all over now Baby Blue.
It's like the world stopped revolving in the absence of you.
We'll stay bone dry and long nights.
Nothing about you but your wheel's been anything but true.

Won't be afraid to walk down my own street forever.
We're never  getting caught again.
So, if you see them tell them.

Man, I just want my bike back..
