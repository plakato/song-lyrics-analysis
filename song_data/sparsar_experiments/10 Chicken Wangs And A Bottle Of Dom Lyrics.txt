Itsty-Bitsy!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey a chicken head.
Bone legged, buckteeth butterfly!

One for the money, two for the show.
Three I want a real big booty to go.
Check it, for the homies, five for the tricks.
And everybody down at the Motel Six.
I had seven girls and they all was tough.
Then I got one more, and now eight is enough.
You know at nine we hit the club and we'll have some fun.
And get ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.

Now the weekend's here, and it's time to have fun.
Ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.
True, up in the club, got love, go ahead and show me.
Holla at a dog baby, you know you know me.
I know you like the sound of the booms so lay the room.
I'm gonna break you off shortly in the hotel room.
I got some tables to serve, uh.
I got ears, you and your friends kick them turn nerds to the curve.
And it ain't no thang, yo.
Cause these wangs the funk, I'm gettin drunk off the pain, so.
Brothers stop sweatin.
I know you want some, but none is what you're gettin.
So, stop standin on the wall, y'all.
I got some greasy old fingers and a belly full of alcohol.
But I'ma hit the floor and have fun.
With ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.

Ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.
Ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.
Ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.
It ain't nothin but a party, let's have some fun.

Ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.
Ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.
Ten chicken wangs and a bottle of dom.
Come over to the table if you want some.

Give me some of them chicken wangs with celery sticks and dip.
A glass of dom, and some hittin songs, and a cute girl on my hip, well come on.
now.
Give me some chicken wangs with celery sticks and dip.
A glass of dom, with some hittin songs, and a cute girl on my hip, well.
alright.

My man was chillin with a girl he met last week.
But let him dance in the corner, he damn near sleep, peep.
Jay's little ho was from Texas.
She was sweatin his gold, layin him back like he just got a Lexus.
My boy, be in black spinnin ends.
In the ends, in the corner with a set of fly ass twins.
And me I'm sittin fat.
Cause I'm the rottweiler and I'm lookin for a kitty cat.
And some high heel pumps and a Doolian-Burke.
Or a fly hairdoo and a teenie skirt.
Fellas lookin angrily.
But don't get mad at me, cause I'm in V.I.P., uh.
My boy, be on a cellular phone.
Hey, yo, wait to hang up cause these wangs are almost gone.
So, keep 'em comin, keep 'em comin hard.
Them buffalo wangs and a bottle of dom.

Sixty-nine chillin in the V.I.P., instead of eatin our wangs away.
Watchin all the girls, with the sister curls steady makin their bootys sway.
Sixty-nine chillin in the V.I.P., instead of eatin our wangs away.
Watchin all the girls, with the sister curls steady makin their bootys sway.
Check it out now.
