Dont let up Lyrics
by Vivekverma.


Probably this job is to fulfill for rags to riches.
And stiches the speeches of every critics which is.
Impeaches my every verdicts then crushed into peices and glitches.
,i coudnt be able to figure when.
Thing started to clutter again and then.
To my fair weather freinds.
I started penin' on them.
But i got the fact.
M mr freakin ,not weakin.
Oh! back to this beat m stickin within.
To make a record to riipin ,creepin and ya hearin.
And spillin every thought like villian m chilin and cheerin.

I am like osama ,obama and dalai lama.
Is just the what way u put me into the drama but i usually go banana like.
saddam uhh.
When someone else lay me into the psychodrama.
And my homie nandan like marihuana and i like rihaana and maddona.
Sometimes i walk around with my head banging that.
Keep bang around and around doesn even know how to escape.
With theses cloud that i am surround.
But imma take ya back in the time when i often defiant.
What was bad happened that pounce my head always when i walk up ahead ,get go.
behind.

Today and tomorow live like a rowdy.
Anybody doubty.
Arbiterate an argument with the past fore it becomes so cloudy.
And mighty ambigious the situation grow into.
Probably ended up makin ur conscious lousy.
And its psychology that makin the things bamboozeled and chaotic.
The heck is goin inside a brain lettin it seems more splenetic or truamatic.
Now rewind it when i became an underdog.
Was like dvelopin anaorexia to people , became stando-.
Ffish my body and soul parted so i bacame psycho.
Now i feel like gettin my confidence back to normal.
From abnormal ,ain't no way imma stop until i become immortal.

Prominently dont back off with the things that makin ya fed up relax sit back.
and rejoice.
Then kick on its face ,opportunity ricochet barely once then get demise.
Probably u r a step behind what u aim it on.
U musta somewhere have had with the things that more usually off than on.
But u gotta get up again ,we are on the same chapter of laughter pain and gain.
How far the same chapter will revise.
One day u will be walk in a fast lane.
I am raising the bar ,tryin to get hell outta this psychological war.
Stomp on the mission what ya aim for until it becomes your cus u invole in war.
