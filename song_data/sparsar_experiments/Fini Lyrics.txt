Fini Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


She like the way the '97 Fini swing.
She like the way the way that '01 Fini swing.
WDNG we with Benny mane.
And it's only the beginning mane.
Drugs in my system I got liquor in my system.
I might swerve on 'em niggas.
Drugs in my system I got liquor in my system.
I might swerve on them niggas.

I know that was him, I'm like I know that was him.
Walk right to the VIP and ain't let you in.
They ain't let you in no they ain't let you in.
Took myself to Follies left with nothing else to spend.
Made myself a topic that just so happened to trend.
I'm just so happy I'm me and you niggas not you niggas.
These hoes fucking with my crew and not you niggas not you niggas.
Swing my Fini on a puddle - wet you up - got you niggas. damn.
I ain't never tripping on my old hoes.
I ain't never slipping I'm on go mode.
Money on my mind like Dre and them.
Skkrt '97 Phoenix swinging and they hate it mane.

She like the way the '97 Fini swing.
She like the way the way that '01 Fini swing.
WDNG we with Benny mane.
And it's only the beginning mane.
Drugs in my system I got liquor in my system.
I might swerve on 'em niggas.
Drugs in my system I got liquor in my system.
I might swerve on them niggas.

I got addys in my system, Jack Daniels in my system.
I'm for sure trying to get her.
Want me to hit ya and I'm finna.
Girlfriend throwing shade I'm coming over when that clear.
Swing on edge we snuck up on her like a hiccup.
By 10 I already know to keep my straw up out my liquor.
One time for my hood mayne. Shout out to the wood grain?
?
I wish that nigga would stay.

She feeling me feeling me off that good cash.
Come on down and ?
She feeling me feeling me off that good cash.
Smokin on some weed nigga that's the way you should act.

She like the way the '97 Fini swing.
She like the way the way that '01 Fini swing.
WDNG we with Benny mane.
And it's only the beginning mane.
Drugs in my system I got liquor in my system.
I might swerve on 'em niggas.
Drugs in my system I got liquor in my system.
I might swerve on them niggas.
