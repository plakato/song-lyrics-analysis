Pull Tha Cars Out Lyrics
by Wu Block.

A lot of guacamole, know a lot of parolees.
Wu-Block, you know we in the buildin.
Get my money off the book like Steve Paul.
This New York rap, I'm on the other side of the map.
Look at me, I'm what these little haters wanna be.
And the people you come up with, they be comin to me.
Your woman starin at us.
Don't get a stain on my Porsche.
The weed in the air.

Wear the tightest dungarees.
She's with Ghostface, yeah a bird on her wrist.
Back to back on the FDR, big cigar.
Yea, we shining. You can tell my niggas is rich.
If I spend a rack today, get that rack back tomorr.
I'm that block on fire, it's like a hundred and three.
Loyal females who can't just give me the twat.
I'm a cash ruler, rulers.
They think like a man, but act like they women.
hundred stacks on the car.
A baby ghost appeared from the blunt smoke.
Light-skined said she a virgo.
They show me like I'm a big stock broker on Wall Street.
Nine nickel plate strap with a bitch on my lap.

zig-zag allah.
Her bag fell, I saw a 38 snub nose.
I only need a few raps when you comin with cheese.
We got the city under siege.
Said she love my roll game and my bird yo.
We gettin money over here.
Rappers come a dime a dozen but they don't come in tha peace.

And live by the code I'mma bust mine.
Pull them cars out.
I said, Nahh, I'm that big drug dealer from 4E!
Them haters ice grillin.

It lingered through her hair and set into her clothes.

Word, tunes, start shorty while I got a tongue in my ear.
Every little spot they know me.
Mask on face, ***********************.
Bust honey on your face,.
Them bottles on the table.
I stole that and still fucked her when the club closed.
I'm your man, 50 grand and I keep it a hundred G.
Where the tightest ladies.
Hey yo.
Slung in front of a lot of these delis eatin cannolis.
I never trust a broad with that in God trust only trust in God.
Staring like they want me to beat.
Everybody try but they can't do it like this.

We make the club jump every time we walk in this bitch.
Rozay and Patron at my throne, women at my feet.

I stayed on the front line like private events in airports.
This Don Donna it starts I bet I won't miss.
You can tell there's a star in one of these cars.
Then fall, act hard, but they livin.
