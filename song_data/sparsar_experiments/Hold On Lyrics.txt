Hold On Lyrics
by Rusko.


Hold on.
I'm coming.
Hold on.
I'm coming.

Oh yeah, I see you baby.
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing.
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute.
Ain't no one here.
And we don't have to talk about it.
I know you'll understand me.
You know how to treat a lady.
You're the only one here.

I know you waited all your life.
And finally you're here with me tonight.
One hand tied behind my back and still your breathless.
Come dance with me.
Come dance with me baby.

Come dance with me baby.

Hold on.
I'm coming, hold on.
I'm coming.
Hold on, hold on.

I know you waited all your life.
And finally you're here with me tonight.
One hand tied behind my back and still your breathless.
Come dance with me.
Come dance with me baby.

Instrumental.

I know you waited all your life.
And finally you're here with me tonight.
One hand tied behind my back and still your breathless.
Come dance with me.
Come dance with me baby.
