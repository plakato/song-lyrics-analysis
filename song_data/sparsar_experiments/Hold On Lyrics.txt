Hold On Lyrics
by Amber Coffman.

Hold on, I'm coming.
Hold on, I'm coming.
Oh, yeah, I see you, baby.
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing.
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute.
.
Ain't no one here.
We don't have to talk about it.
I know you'll understand it.
? a lady.
You're the only one here.
.
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh, yeah, I see you, baby.
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing.
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute.
.
Ain't no one here.
We don't have to talk about it.
I know you'll understand it.
? a lady.
You're the only one here.
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on.
