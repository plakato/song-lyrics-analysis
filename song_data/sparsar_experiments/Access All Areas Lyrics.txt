Access All Areas Lyrics
by Womanly Hips.

We call it Urbex â€“ that's urban exploration, 
A modern manifestation of the primeval need to discover 
Not content to walk on rugs under which the dirt is swept 
Instead. We pull back the cover, 
Wielding handheld flash-lights, with ragged trackie-dacks 
And stacks of fat. Sacks of sandwiches in our backpacks 
We go deep into the drains where the darkness gets colder. 
The water levels rising, but our steps never falter. 
We smile to our sides at the paint on the wall, 
There's artful masterpieces next to meaningless, scrawls, 
Sit and chill under the grill, from which sickly light spills 
Have our fill. What do we feel? I don't want to sit still 
See the drain on the wall? Small. We call it a feeder 
It's, not the main feature radius of half a meter 
One of us climb in so we follow the leader 
Let's, see where this tiny tunnel can lead us, 
 
Both hands on the floor as we crawl under the city, 
Means. No more for the torch
