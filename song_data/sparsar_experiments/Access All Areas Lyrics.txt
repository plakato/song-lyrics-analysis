Access All Areas Lyrics
by Womanly Hips.

We call it Urbex â€“ that's urban exploration.
A modern manifestation of the primeval need to discover.
Not content to walk on rugs under which the dirt is swept.
Instead we pull back the cover.
Wielding handheld flash-lights with ragged trackie-dacks.
And stacks of fat sacks of sandwiches in our backpacks.
We go deep into the drains where the darkness gets colder.
The water levels rising but our steps never falter.
We smile to our sides at the paint on the wall.
There's artful masterpieces next to meaningless scrawls.
Sit and chill under the grill from which sickly light spills.
Have our fill, what do we feel? I don't want to sit still.
See the drain on the wall, small: we call it a feeder.
It's not the main feature radius of half a meter.
One of us climb in so we follow the leader.
Let's see where this tiny tunnel can lead us.

Both hands on the floor as we crawl under the city.
Means no more for the torch; that's a pity.
Surrounded underground hear the sound of cars from the surface.
Of scum-skimmers driving round with no purpose.
Hands start to hurt we've been crawling for ages.
In dank, dirty air you can literally taste it, feeling suffocated.
Face it, we won't make it, my heart's racing, there's no escaping, we'll have.
to turn back.
But as our suffocated spirits start to slip.
We see ahead in the distance the tip.
Of a halo of light, showing us the way out.
It's been a great trip but I wanna see the light of day now.
At the end of the journey, wanna collapse but not yet.
Brace against the concrete, push with all that we've got left.
Climb out onto the grass, scrambling on the morning dew.
Emerging from the dirt in the middle of Northbourne Avenue.
