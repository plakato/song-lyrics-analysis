Advent Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Picture this drinking your Bacardi son/.
50 Cent got 9 shots; you'll get the other 41/.
Picture this, gangsters dealing in coke/.
50 Cent survived his 9 shots but you little Gs just won't/.
Smoking shitty spliffs so swift, my peers think with sausages/.
Then you wonder why they under, they can't think positive/.
So don't call yourself soldier; you're not in an infantry/.
And the word bullshit don't even invoke the imagery/.
Enslaved gangsta rappers, mirror their masters, it'll hurt to show/.

I ain't no white savior, no Sir Christopher Columbus/.
But for me everything is secondary to justice/.
You advertise/ a lie/ cause I know there's a better way/.
Like an aborted fetus, I wasn't born yesterday/.
I don't care what you little pricks go learn to be/.
Just know it's an evil game like the Olympics in Germany/.

I freed my mind like Abe Lincoln's slaves with scripture/.
And my words are missed by the censorship filter/.
Punish billionaires, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet/.
Urban robin hoods roaring, “You can just suck it!” /.
They could save the whole-wide world at the drop of a bucket/.
But like the Iceland Volcano, their heart is Core-rupted/.
Don't tell me to stuff it; I'm not a thanksgiving turkey/.
I ain't giving thanks for the bank winning perky early/.
If politics is the third world, I'm the IMF/.
Intelligent Minister Freedman, gonna leave nothing left/.
How does it feel to be cursed by every religious book? /.
This the cry of Naboth, “Yo look at what those snitches took!” /.
Witnesses look, apokalypsis of steep prescriptions/.
Causing stupid shit riots over Artemis in Ephesus/.
Feeling like John the Baptist standing over the Jordan/.
Repent, God's coming, so don't say I didn't give warning/.

O holy night! The stars are brightly shining/.
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth/.
Long lay the world in sin and error pinning/.
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth/.
Truly He taught us to love one another/.
His law is love and His gospel is peace/.
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother/.
And in His name all oppression shall cease/.
