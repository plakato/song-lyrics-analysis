Make It Wit Chu Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.

You wanna know if I know why?
I can't say that I do.
Don't understand the evil eye.
Or how one becomes two.
I just can't recall what started it all.
Or how to begin in the end.
I ain't here to break it.
Just see how far it will bend.
Again and again, again and again.

I wanna make it.
I wanna make it wit chu.

I wanna make it.
I wanna make it witchu.

Sometimes the same is different.
But mostly it's the same.
These mysteries of life.
That just ain't my thing.
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon.
I'd be untrue.
The only thing I know for sure.
Is what I won't do.
Anytime, anywhere and I say.

I wanna make it.
I wanna make it wit chu.

I wanna make it.

I wanna make it wit chu.

I wanna make it.
I wanna make it wit chu.

I wanna make it.
I wanna make it wit chu.
