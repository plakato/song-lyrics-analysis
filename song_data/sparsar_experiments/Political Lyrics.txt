Political Lyrics
by Rumor.


Ugh!They say your power is in your thumb.
And knowledge is power.
So if it's not in our heads does it make us dumb?
Lets go ahead and ballot, Let's give 'em some.
No no no they can have it all we don't want none.
You can have the good lands leave us in the slums.
You can have all the bread, just give us the crumbs.
Look what our thumbs have made you become.
A couple of years later, a bunch of Donald Trumps.
With swizz bank accounts and multiple Pied-Ã -terre.
Have you seen the villages in the cities rear?
The government school kids scrambling for chairs.
But you'll never know cos your kids don't school here.
Your term of office is coming to an end.
It's time to summon all your family and friends.
Cos the election is approaching again.
Tell us what we wanna hear and we'll make sure you win.

Hear them, I hear them saying.
Money and power make the world go round and round.
They playing all the dirty games.
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
Should we pretend that everything's all right?
And wait for the government to change your life.
Shift the paradigm in your mind.
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?

The nation loves me, I'm like it's hero.
I'll provide the needs of the ordinary people.
That's what I tell them but then again my true goal.
Is to rob you with the help of my government bureau.
But I have no inclination of telling you that.
Democracy's on vacation, hush and pay your taxes.
Motto is forward never, forever backwards.
Appreciate your ex-gratia payments gracias.
But how about a re-up.
You can call it grotesque I'm not giving this seat up.
Go ahead and protest, y'all just gon' get beat up.
This is a lucrative business you'll never get a piece of.
Do you know how many people I imprisoned?
How many more I have killed for no reason?
I'm guilty of treason.
Can't give the power up for the above reasons.

Spoken Word: Rumor.

I'm riding through the city, windows not rolled down.
I can hear the silent chaos of the whole town.
Hawkers selling.
Trotro conductors or mates as we call them down here yelling.
Angry mob lynching a felon.
They said he stole a fowl and that was foul.
So they beat him up until he cried out loud.
But really.
What about the sinister minister who robbed the.
Whole nation of every of it's pesewa and cedi.
