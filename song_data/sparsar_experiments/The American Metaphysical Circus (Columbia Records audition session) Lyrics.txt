The American Metaphysical Circus (Columbia Records audition session) Lyrics
by United States of America.

At precisely 8-0-5.
Doctor Frederick von Meyer.
Will attempt his famous dive.
Through a solid sheet of luminescent fire.

In the center of the ring.
They are torturing a bear.
And although he cannot sing.
They can make him whistle Londonerry Air.

And the price is right.
The cost of one admission is your mind.

We shall shortly institute.
A syncopation of fear.
While it's painful, it will suit.
Many customers whose appetites are queer.

Or for those who wish to pay.
There are children you can bleed.
In a most peculiar way.
We can give you all the instruments you'll need.

And the price is right.
The cost of one admission is your mind.

If you're harder yet to serve.
We have most delightful dreams.
Our recorders will preserve.
The intensity and passion of your screams.

For we only aim to please.
It's our customers who gain.
As their appetites increase.
They must come to us for pleasure and for pain.

And the price is right.
The cost of one admission is your mind.
