Boogie lights Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

They don't even know you're name.
Anonymous blood and carnal gains.

Playing hide and seek for days.
Our love is buried in cocaine.

Spell it out or swallow your pride.
Spell it out or swallow your pride.
Spell it out or say goodbye.
Just look the camera in the eye.

Faces on the corner.
Bodies on the screen.
Films can't keep us younger.
It feels so good  to dream.

Barely old enough to drive.
You're pulling the chord on these boogie lights.

Spreading east past the 405.
To the Valley, lust is life.

Spell it out or swallow your pride.
Spell it out or swallow your pride.
Spell it out or say goodbye.
Just look the camera in the eye.

Faces on the corner.
Bodies on the screen.
Films can't keep us younger.
It feels so good  to dream.

You're gonna be a star.
