Shine a Light Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.


I keep my head up tight, I make my plans at night.
And I don't sleep, I don't sleep, I don't sleep 'til it's light.
Some folks float, some are buried alive.

There is an awful sound, this haunted town.
It will not, it will not, it will not just be quiet.
Some ghosts sink, some will get called to the light.

I spend boring hours in the office tower.
In a bus, on a bus back home to you.
And that's fine I'm barely alive.

It's just a matter of time, no one gets out alive.
And I'm content, I'm content, I'm content to be quiet.
Some will sink, some will get called to the light.

You know our hearts beat time out very slowly.
You know our hearts beat time.
They're waiting for something that'll never arrive.

I keep my head up tight, I make my plans at night.
And I don't sleep, I don't sleep, I don't sleep 'til it's light.
Some folks float, some are buried alive.

With our little boots, we built another world.
Where we're chain, chain, chain, chain, chained to the light.
That's fine, our blood is alive.

You know our hearts beat time out very slowly.
You know our hearts beat time.
They're waiting for something that'll never arrive.
