Her Heart Is Only Human Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


She's one in a million.
I've heard that a million times.
The odds were less than.
Even she'd be mine.
How many times does a dream come true.
Come into your life.
I can't believe the way she makes me feel.
I have to pinch myself to know it's real.

A touch so soft, a smile so sweet.
She's so much like an angel, she's heavenly.
She's as perfect as anyone can be.
But her heart is only human guess that's why she's loving me.

She could've had anyone she wanted.
But still she wanted me.
I do my best to give her what she needs.
I thank my lucky stars above.
That I'm the one she loves.
So many men will never find their way.
To what I wake up looking forward to each day.

God never made a more down to earth girl.
But the love she gives me takes me.
Right out of this world.
She's as perfect as anyone can be.
But her heart is only human, guess that's why she's loving me.
Her heart is only human, guess that's why she's loving me.
