No Stress Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

No fighting, no drama.
Life's too short, we've got no time to squander.
Walking aimless looking down, you gotta wonder.
Is WorldStar our guiding light or road to sight?
It might be simplified, it could be amplified.
But when we're unified, who could divide?
That's why I'm writing for the unexpressed.
Feeling good and living life, feeling no stress.

No fighting, no drama.
Life's too short, we've got no time to squander.
Walking aimless looking down, you gotta wonder.
You gotta wonder....
