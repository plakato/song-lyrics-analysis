Freestyle Friday paragraphs Lyrics
by Ryan Anthony G..

Lately we have been learning about topic sentences, concrete details,.
commentary, and conclusion sentences.Iv been writing essays for the past month.
are so. My paragraph won't be rhyming because i dont think i can rhyme about.
this topic.

For the past month Weve been writing essays about archetypes In the Genesis.
and a Greek myth Comparing and contrasting them It starts with a topic.
Sentence It's kind of like a thesis And I've been writing tall that in In.
world history to get me ready for that gate way. To last a life time Next we use a.
Concrete Detail A fact to support part of our topic sentence I've learned.
the hard way That it has to be An event from the story To support that.
Concrete Detail You use two pieces of commentary They can be your take on.
something from the story Your opinion, analysis It just can't be A fact You.

Concluding Sentence This is another part that's really similar To the essays.
I write in World history You just have to reiterate your Topic Sentence Since.
now you've proved it.
