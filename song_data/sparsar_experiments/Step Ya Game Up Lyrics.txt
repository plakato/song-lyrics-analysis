Step Ya Game Up Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


Know I'm tal'n bout, I'm tired of these old.
Lame ass, lazy ass, don't wanna grind ass.
But they wanna complain all the time ass.
Wish they was me ass, know I'm tal'n bout.
I worked for where I'm at, know I'm tal'n bout.

Step ya game up partna, step ya game up.
Step ya game up partna, step ya game up.
Get on your grind and go get it, get your change up.
You falling off homeboy, you better change up.

Paul Wall.
Have you ever, noticed the people that's lazy and lame.
Be the same ones crying, and always complain.
You on the sidelines partna, better get in this game.
You need to change, if you trying to get change.
You must of fell on your brain, as a little kid.
You wanna shine then you gotta grind homeboy, that's just how it is.
Handle your bis', you wishing on a star.
For money, hoes, clothes and cars, but you walk by far.
You think a Bentley, just gon fall out the sky.
You spending all your money worrying about, being fly and getting high.
Stick to the G-Code, all the rules still apply.
You slacking on your hustle, boy you living a lie.
You run a block a couple hours, then you start getting tired.
So why hating everytime, I pull up on chrome wires.
You need to wake up out your sleep, cause you falling off.
Step ya game up, you getting soft, step it up.

Paul Wall.
Look here hold your nuts cuz, and swallow your fear.
Your future's looking kinda shady, but I see quite clear.
I'm riding in the fast lane, you still in first gear.
You've been driving the same car, for the past five years.
You claim to be a baller, but boy really you broke.
I'm buying bottles, and you barely buying Hennessy and Coke.
Take a good look in the mirror, you a joke.
You was on the ship to success, but I guess you fell off the boat.
You either leave or get left, buy or get bought.
Break or get broke, cause it's teach or get taught.
I'm the age of a student, but I'm teaching a lesson.
Consider it a blessing, for you to be in my presence.
You something like a has-been, you was hot back then.
But now-a-days you ain't nothing, but some dust in the wind.
Get with the time, and quit worrying about mine homie.
Get on your grind, and everything gon turn out fine.

Mike Jones.
I be sick and tired of haters, hating on the fact that I made it.
But it's a funny, a year ago y'all haters said I wouldn't make it.
But now y'all saying I'm overrated, and I got too much hype.
But back then you said I'll flop, cause my flow wasn't tight.
A year ago, the whole world didn't know my name.
So I had to get on my grind, and step up my game.
My name Mike Jones and I'm on the microphone, wrecking tape decks.
Collecting checks, while y'all sitting at home.
A lot of people to this day, be talking down on my flow.
But who you know get five thousand, for a flow or a show.
Who say his name a hundred times, and still get love from his fans.
Who blew up in seven months, and in popular demand.
Who you know that got a movie, and some clothes coming out.
Who spend shit for the ladies, to keep em running out.
Mike Jones nigga, and don't you forget it.
While you at home living po', I'm balling independent.
