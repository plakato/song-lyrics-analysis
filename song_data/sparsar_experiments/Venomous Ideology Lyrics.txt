Venomous Ideology Lyrics
by Wordburglar.


Alright, I used to be a man.
Who tried to play by the rules.
I worked hard, had a wife.
Walked my kid to his.
school.
A simple fool like my brother.
Who fought in their wars.
In exchange for drinking problems.
And a loss of support.
Not anymore-.
They found his body spread across the highway.
Head-on collision with some family who couldn't drive straight.
Irate, I lost the American Dream.
Went from selling used cars to running pyramid schemes.
Hoodwinking investors.
That's where I got my first case.
Recruited like minds.
We met on Thursdays.
Because money buys weapons.
And very good lawyers.
Next thing you know I got an island.
Plus some tank destroyers.
I must be doing something right.
Is what I told myself.
Kidnapping presidents, throw them into holding cells.
See I'm like no one else.
A rattle charmer.
Going to work in helmet,.
hood and battle armor.

I'm a brainwasher.
bleeding hearts and hippies.
Carve my face in the moon.
So you'll never forget me.
Put mind control in everything-.
Perfume to chewing gum.
Psychos and maniacs?
I'm always interviewing some.
New members.
Man haven't you heard?
Ask my accountant.
He's the one dressed like a bird.
I turn your town around.
Until you're living like royalty.
And all I ask is nothing but unquestioning loyalty.

I'm the man, the mask, the myth, the urban legend.
The snake in the grass that you're never sure where I'm headin'.
I'll be the vermin you're frettin'.
Certain you're nervous and sweatin'.
From the way I earn my rep with less conservative weapons.

Duke: Our old enemy called Cobra Commander.
?: Got an appetite for destruction.
?: Five forces that your gravity will fly orders.
?: Operation crush planet nerf right palm.

I got a burning ambition.
And a venomous ideology.
A thing for snakes.
And cutting-edge high technology.
My economy?
Diamonds to ruples.
And my philosophy?
Who needs scruples.
Morality, ethics, those are just a curse to carry.
If I got any problems, got a rolodex of mercenaries.
To hurt and bury, I'm trying to keep the hate alive.
No I'm not crazy-.
Just dangerously destabilized.
It pays to lie.
Truth is, whatever I say to guys.
Anything I don't like-.
I vaporize.
Robots with laser eyes.
Zap your mom while she's baking pies.
I'm Cobra Commander.
Exactly what the name implies.
Take the prize for charismatic, sociopathic.

You're lonely and tragic.
Time to get open to habit.
Running rackets through whatever helps the scope of my ravage.
To cope with the madness-.
You gotta be a bit nutty.
I just want to rule the globe.
I'm not that fussy.
Complete chaos, corporation lay-offs.
Labor from your neighbors doing favors for some pay-offs.
Make you quit your day job.
Stick it to your lame boss.
Aiming for your veins engrave my name in your brain, ha!
Insane plots is what I consider mad fun.
I love ideas.
Especially the bad ones.
