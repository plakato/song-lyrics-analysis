Protect The Castle Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.

Unorthodocks.
Docks is back in effect, catching wreck with no hassle.
Like what you expect? Hit the deck and protect the castle.
You ain't ready for a tussle buddy, let alone a struggle.
Rebuttals for the battle, you better dead it on the double.
We just keep on bubbling while you wonder whats under us?.
Hustle from sun to dusk, buster blunders met with a Blunderbuss.
I'm such a wondrous wordsmith when I'm rhyming.
The way I tie lines together superbly with perfect timing.
Unearth a diamond a minute every time that I'm in it.
Or better yet, every second and that's why this time it's printed.
Rhyme styles infinite, invented to bust your nose.
In your nose-bleed seats when you shout and cuss at my shows.
You're just dust and it blows, while I'm blazing a trail.
But still keep a place to bail in Mesa and Scottsdale.
Not chasing no hot tail, I'm lacing these pot scales.
While slaying these hot beats and praying he got bail.
If they saying he not real, I don't hear em and never will.
I'm heroin in a pill, Deniro when in a film.
Ain't here to win or appeal or in inherently get a mil'.
I was barely getting meals and my parents borrowed from me.
I would lay awake in bed and would ponder sorrowfully.
About what tomorrow would be and what today had just been.
I would have given anything to just not replay it again.
I would say and engrave and pen as I'd rave and rant to myself.
But I think that was the first chance at understanding myself.
Others are underhanded I'm outright demanding my wealth.
Stranded and unbranded with a couple grand and my health.
The last gram bandit standing, hand to hand with the stealth.
Ain't no man for no manners romantic fanatic playboy.
Manic from organic, allegory and grammar's play toys.
Manage writing mechanics to my advantage and stay poised.
