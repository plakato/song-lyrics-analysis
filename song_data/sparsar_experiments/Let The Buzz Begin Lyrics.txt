Let The Buzz Begin Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Yo, you don't know what the hassle brings/.
I'm on fire! But I'm low on gasoline/.
My words sting like killer bees/.
This is epic like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
Like I said, I'm ready to dominate/.
No weak punches, never call it a day/.
All in my way/ just move/.
The problem ain't that I don't give an F, it's that I do/.
Chasing this imaginary crown/.
But the only thing that scares me is my frown/.
Whining how/ I wanna B.B. the King.
I came out new/ with a tongue split in two/.
Otherwords, I came out of the blues/ surprise/.
With sharp words that will bring your demise/.

The problem ain't that I can't kill you but that I could/ look/.
At the direction, the wind is taking/.
Resilience proves I'm vindicated/.
Take it up a notch, buffoons/.
Cause I don't buy the hard disc, anymore, cause ITune/.
Out! Garbage, don't get started kid/.
Black Eyed Peas said ‘Let's get retarded' then they did! /.
They float like a butterfly, sting like a.
Bee/ I'ma bee, I'ma bee, I'ma bee /.
I brought the news/ taught the truths/ while you cop.
The shoes/ my style is caught in a noose/.
You're one track minded, my thoughts in twos/.
Hip-Hop is like Nascar, you stop you lose/ Crash!
Thieves only kill and destroy/.
I'm the owner with skill cause I give life and a voice/.

I'm like mothers whose kids got aborted/.
I hate the ladies with the picket signs/.
That say “Pro-choice” cause I didn't get mine/.
For each child that died in my stomach/.
I'm going to bring that skill times a hundred/.
Cause my fruitful mind is in abundance/.
Cry me a river, I'll cut some onions/.
I wrote these bars like it was nothing/.
This is the come back of the ugly duckling/.
Life handed me lemons, so I made a pie/.
Then lemon juice, then I ate the rinds/.
Even the trash I use is redemptive/.
So your laughter was but a brief second/.
You still lost?/ I'll give my argument a.
Crucifix just to get my point across/.
One man's trash is another treasure/.
Your treasure is my trash, I know it's clever/.
Leave heads severed/ I've never/ been good at.
Math, so I can't calculate forever/.
Hear that I'm sad yet always rejoicing/.
Poor yet I'm made rich through what the noise bring/.
That I have nothing, yet possess all things/.
Gone for the win, with God's strong reach/.
This long speech, shows that I'm tough till the end/.
Now, let the buzz begin/.
