Let The Buzz Begin Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Yo, you don't know what the hassle brings/ 
I'm on fire, But I'm low on gasoline/ 
My words sting like killer bees/. 
This is epic. Like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy 
Like, I said: I'm ready to dominate/ 
No weak punches, never call it a day/ 
All. In my way/ just move/ 
The problem ain't that I don't give an F it's that I do/ 
Chasing, this imaginary crown/ 
But. The only thing that scares me is my frown/ 
Whining how/ I wan na B.B., the King 
I came out new/ with a tongue split in two/ 
Otherwords. I came out of the blues/ surprise/ 
With, sharp words that will bring your demise/ 

The problem, ain't that I can't kill you, but that I could/ look/ 
At the direction the wind is taking/ 
Resilience proves I'm vindicated/ 
Take it up a notch. Buffoons/ 
Cause! I don't buy the hard disc anymore, cause ITune/, 
Out Garbage, don't get started, kid/ 
Black, Eyed Peas said ‘Let's get retarded', then they did. / 
They float like a butterfly sting like a 
Bee/ I'ma bee I'ma bee I'ma bee / 
I brought the news/ taught the truths/. While you cop 
The shoes/, my style is caught in a noose/ 
You're. One track minded. My thoughts in twos/ 
Hip-Hop is like Nascar. You stop you lose/ Crash 
Thieves only kill and destroy/ 
I'm, the owner with skill cause. I give life and a voice/ 

I'm like mothers, whose kids got aborted/ 
I hate. The ladies with the picket signs/ 
That, say “Pro-choice” cause I didn't get mine/ 
For each child that died in my stomach/ 
I'm, going to bring that skill times a hundred/ 
Cause. My fruitful mind is in abundance/ 
Cry me a river I'll cut. Some onions/ 
I wrote, these bars like it was nothing/ 
This is the come back of the ugly duckling/ 
Life handed me lemons, so I made a pie/ 
Then lemon juice. Then I ate the rinds/ 
Even. The trash I use is redemptive/ 
So. Your laughter was but a brief second/ 
You still lost / I'll give my argument a 
Crucifix. Just to get my point. Across/ 
One man's trash is another treasure/. 
Your treasure is my trash. I know it's clever/ 
Leave heads severed/, I've never/ been good at 
Math, so I can't calculate forever/ 
Hear that I'm sad yet always rejoicing/ 
Poor. Yet I'm made rich through what the noise bring/ 
That. I have nothing yet possess all things/ 
Gone for the win. With God's strong reach/ 
This long speech shows that I'm tough till the end/ 
Now let the buzz begin/
