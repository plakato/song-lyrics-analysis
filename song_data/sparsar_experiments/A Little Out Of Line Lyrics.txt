A Little Out Of Line Lyrics
by 4th Pyramid.

Ben Stevenson:.
You got a lot to say all of a sudden.
As the snow flies in your veins.
Oh you cold hearted woman.
Tell me how to feel about it.
When you couldn't tell me why.
No don't tell me ‘bout my manners baby.
When I'm not welcome at your table.

Say I'm a little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.

Ben Stevenson:.
Cause I'd rather tell the truth then save it.
No there's nothing I can do but break it.
I see you standing on a hill staring at the sky.
With flowers in your hair and diamonds in your eye.
So I see you around it tears me up inside.
It's cold you know it's true but I could never lie.

A little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.

4th Pyramid:.
I'm out my mind.
A little outta line.
Sitting at the bar out in Vegas alone.
Faded stumble back trying to make it I'm stoned.
While I mumble to myself man this bitch is so cold.
But she stays up in my mind her whole fragrance perfumed.
Can feel the pain inside the hue of the paint in the room.
Thinking about the girl I knew and now the fakeness exudes.
Riddle of sphinx baby.
let you play with them jewels.
Took a Cruise out the blue let me make you my muse.
Never thought you'd fucking play me try to make me a fool.
You can't crush me trick you can't touch me.
Bitch you can't trust me shit just ran ugly.
She fucks me…she fucks me not.
Smoke blow out the window girl what you need I got.
Yea I need to stop memories of me on top.
In a box with the motherfucking keys its locked.

A little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.
I'm a little out of line.
