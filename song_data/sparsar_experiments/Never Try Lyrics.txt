Never Try Lyrics
by PUP (band).

Every morning I keep sleepin'
Cause in the nighttime, I'm dreamin' of
My childhood schoolyard
I was breathing
Air on the street. Where I grew up

You tell me I should know better
You're, probably right
It's, just a phase
I'll come back 10 years from now
And, nothing will have changed

Cause. I know I never try
Oh. Oh, oh, oh oh
And, I wan na know
If. I leave here alive
Oh. Oh, oh, oh oh

Am. I too old
To be camping. Out
On, my back porch
In, the suburbs
Where. I was born
You, never made me happy

And. I know I never try
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh oh
And! I wan na know
If. I leave here alive
Oh - oh, oh, oh oh

And. Even when I try
I can't recall
Faces of
Anyone at all

And, I dreamt of you
In Montreal
In places. I'Ve
Never been at all

This, isn't what I was hoping for
I. Barely ever dream
About you anymore

When everything you want
Has come and gone. Then you'll know

Oh! I never try
Oh. Oh oh, oh oh
And. I wan na know
If. I leave here alive
Oh! Oh, oh, oh oh
