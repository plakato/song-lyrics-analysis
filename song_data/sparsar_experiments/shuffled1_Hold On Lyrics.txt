Hold On Lyrics
by Amber Coffman.

Hold on, hold on  .
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute  .
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing  .
You're the only one here  .
Hold on.
Hold on, I'm coming  .
Hold on, hold on  .
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute  .
Oh, yeah, I see you, baby  .
Hold on, I'm coming  .
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing  .
? a lady  .
You're the only one here  .
.
Hold on, hold on  .
Ain't no one here  .
Oh, yeah, I see you, baby  .
  .
I know you'll understand it  .
  .
Ain't no one here  .
We don't have to talk about it  .
  .
I know you'll understand it  .
? a lady  .
We don't have to talk about it  .
