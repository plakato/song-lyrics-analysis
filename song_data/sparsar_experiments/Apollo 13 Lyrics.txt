Apollo 13 Lyrics

Yeah.
Had a dream in a Nissan riding with my B on.
Another young kid with an old mind.
Living on a tightrope so he might go psycho but he stay sane for the goldmine.
I don't mind if I die in the process.
Life's short but I long for the Loch Ness Monster.
Sponsor pain and the progress.
Aim for a battle but I land on the conquest.
Got a crown on my head.
Fuck a fitted, got a crown on my head.
I'm the one that did it when you wanted me to quit it.
Admitted I'm bout to get it off the sound of my head.
When you drown in the dread of the hate that you made.
I'mma count bread to replace what I gave to the world.
That's a whole bunch of hits for free.
I'm my own drug dealer my life's for me.

I like the way you talk to me.
Let's roll on, roll on, roll on.

Uh.
Another day goes by.
Another base in this game I slide.
Can't stay home safe, and won't wait.
For the moment when the rain gon' dry.
Waitin' for the minute, I get the recognition.
Gotta get out and get it.
Not a second for decision.
No time to wait, no time to waste.
Give a time and place and I'll kill it.
I've been patiently waiting to take it.
Make no mistake this is real.
Jesus had made me to make it.
Just can't explain how I feel.
Even if caged in steel this pain you feel my name is real.
I'll remain right here, all the lames stay clear.
This lane I made I steer.

I like the way you talk to me.
Let's roll on, roll on, roll on.

Newest member in the game.
We fuckin' around and she screamin' my name.
Beast from the east I'm hard to tame.
You lookin' at us like we in it for the fame.
But when we are just fuckin' soldiers in the game.
Now that I'm a little older, look at my perception.
Lookin' at my life through a different intersection: DIEMON.
Cause I am boppin' and droppin' motherfuckers who fake.
Up in the AM tryin' to wake and I bake.
Step up in my city let me show you what it take.
God is on my side so tell me how I'm gonna lose.
Contemplating life so tell me why we pick and choose.
Tryin' to kill the track when you can barely make a bruise.
Life's a fuckin bitch so now you giving 'em in twos.
Smoke a couple more, let me lighten up the mood.

I like the way you talk to me.
Let's roll on, roll on, roll on.
