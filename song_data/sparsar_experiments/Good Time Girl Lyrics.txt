Good Time Girl Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

I don't wanna be? I don't wanna be.
A good time girl A good time girl.
String you along like I string my pearls.
A typical good time girl.
A good time girl.
A good time girl.
A typical good time girl.
I don't need no diamonds now.
They'd seem like broken glass.
I'd never wear a fur.
Would seem like stepping into anothers skin.
A typical good time girl like me.
A good time girl.
A good time girl.
A typical good time girl.
A typical good time girl.
