Don't Answer Me (Early Rough Mix) Lyrics
by Alan Parsons.

If you believe in.
The power of magic.
I can change your mind.
And if you need to.
Believe in someone.
Turn and look behind.
When we were living.
In a dream world.
Clouds got in the way.
We gave it up in.
A moment of madness.
And threw it all away.
Don't answer me.
Don't break the silence.
Don't let me win.
Don't answer me.
Stay on your island.
Don't let me in.
Run away and.
Hide from everyone.
Can you change the things.
We've said and done?
If you believe in.
The power of magic.
It's all a fantasy.
So if you need to.
Believe in someone.
Just pretend it's me.
It ain't enough that.
We meet as strangers.
I can't set you free.
So will you turn your back forever.
On what you mean to me?
Don't answer me.
Don't break the silence.
Don't let me win.
Don't answer me.
Stay on your island.
Don't let me in.
Run away and.
Hide from everyone.
Can you change the things.
We've said and done?
Don't answer me.
Don't break the silence.
Don't let me win.
Don't answer me.
Stay on your island.
Don't let me in.
Run away and.
Hide from everyone.
Don't answer me.
Don't break the silence.
Don't let me win.
Don't answer me.
Stay on your island.
Don't let me in.
Can you change the things.
We've said and done?
Don't answer me.
Don't break the silence.
Don't let me win.
Don't answer me.
Stay on your island.
Don't let me in.
