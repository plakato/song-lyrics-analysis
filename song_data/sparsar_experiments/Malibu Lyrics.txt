Malibu Lyrics
by Vit p√§ls.

Malibu, oh Malibu where the water is filled with silver, Malibu.
Malibu, oh Malibu where the water is filled with silver, Malibu.

Where I come from, it's cold and dark by winter.
So I tried to sleep the whole day through.
But I woke up at least four times.

Then I spotted a Sean Paul video.
And he was dancing along the shoreline with a lot of girls.
And a milkshake.

Malibu, oh Malibu where the water is filled with silver, Malibu.
Malibu, oh Malibu where the water is filled with silver, Malibu.
