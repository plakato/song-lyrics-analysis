Feels (Official) Lyrics
by WolfTyla.


I have been soul searching lately.
You don't come real to me baby.
Lately it's you who's been switching up on me like ocean waves under a full.
moon.
Can't even look in my eyes.
Always them vs me and mine.
But really you're wasting my time.
I was about you from 9 until 9.
Infatuated with killing my vibe.
You called it love.
I called it no trust.
You called it real.
I called it no us.
Funny how worthless.
You made me feel.
I know where my worth is.
But right now.
I only need me.
I only need me.
I only needâ€¦

Baby girl I wanna drink and waste time.
Either you staying or you not mine.
I don't want no 9 until 9.
I just want to get it, without even trying.

It's so easy for you to drink away problems.
Head in the clouds tryna smoke your way out it.
It's like when summer is over you discard all thoughts of me.
Like you don't remember loving me.
Lets reminisce.
You always told me.
You were ROD.
Day one, a soulmate, a lover, a homie.
When she switch up and start tripping.
Don't call me.
Cause I won't pick up.
I won't pick up.
Say I won't pick up.
I won't pick up.

You adore wasting time.
You only wanna drink.
You're inhaling these clouds to forget about me.
