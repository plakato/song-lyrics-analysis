My love, I will hold on to your touch.
'Til there's nothing left of us.
Save you from this life.

In the cold weight, in the Rockies' touch.
Won't take away our love.
Save you from this life.

And I'll hold, I'll hold on to your touch.
'Til there's nothing left of us.
Save you from this life.

And I'll hold, I'll hold on to your touch.
Till they find the bones of us.
Save you from this life.

And under the rubble.
Of the mountain that tumbled.
I'll hold you forever.
I'll hold you forever.

And under the rubble.
Of the mountain that tumbled.
I'll hold you forever.
I'll hold you forever.

And they'll build up another.
On the bodies of our brothers.
And I'll love you forever.
