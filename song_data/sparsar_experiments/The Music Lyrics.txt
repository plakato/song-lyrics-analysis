The Music Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

They could hear the music playing softly.
From somewhere not that far away.
They were getting closer and closer.
Their feet were moving to the sound of the beat.
And they said.
We just wanna.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
We just wanna.
We just wanna dance.
They could hear the music now all around them.
The night was young and life was easy.
And tomorrow was the last thing on their mind.
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake.
They just wanna.
They just wanna dance.
They just wanna.
They just wanna dance.
They just wanna.
They just wanna dance.
They just wanna.
They just wanna dance....
