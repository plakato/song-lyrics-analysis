Transplant Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


Trickle me down, I am like water.
I'll be your birth, I'll be your slaughter.
But no I don't have much to say.
Yes I am here but I'll decay.
If you don't leave me.

I've heard stories of purgatories.
They rip your soul out of its place.
What you have missed, what you have gained.
And I've forgotten.
That I am rotten.
When I am lost within your space.
My heart feels like its been replaced.
