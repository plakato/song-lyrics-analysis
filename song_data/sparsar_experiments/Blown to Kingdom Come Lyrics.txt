Blown to Kingdom Come Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Out in the world you can watch'em struggling.
For a small piece of luck.
They won't die with a smile on their trace.

For possession they'd kill their mothers.
For some bucks they deny themselves.
And the whole world is right in that trace.

They are Riding Forth.
No time to lose.
Got to alter every place.
They are Riding Forth.
No way to choose.
And the next step's out to space.

With a high hand they watch their buildings.
Self-righteously praise their deeds.
No time for recess on their way.

In a way it is quite amusing.
But it's afake of deepest dye.
Let's hope they'll see it one day.

They are Riding Forth.
No time to lose.
Got to alter every place.
They are Riding Forth.
No way to choose.
And the next step's out to space.

Pay Attention to History.
Look at All the Things They've Done.
No Remains, There's No Thing Left.
It's All Blown to Kingdom Come.
