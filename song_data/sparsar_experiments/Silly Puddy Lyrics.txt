Silly Puddy Lyrics
by Zion I.


Lord gimme what I need gimme what I need.
Gimme what I need gimme what I.
Need. Lord gimme what I need gimme what I need.

Zumbi.
Dear Lord you show me the best of times.
You show me the worst of time.
Confusion all over my mind but still I be bustin' rhymes.
And I fight for what I want, but I die for what I need.
And I watch my people bleed while vultures steady feed.
We proceed with the mic bless.
Crashin' in your likeness.
More deadlier than vipers.
Lyric spirit snipers.
Ignite us.
We'll be candles in the dark.
Solid like Noah's Ark.
I was destined for this part.
In the scheme of thangs.
We kings and queens eatin' chicken wings.
But greasy finger tips can't hold the cepters so it slips.
Now who's equip to come up on a grip.
Abraver with Fraiser Lee I wait for the response.
And I'm locked and loaded missiles ready set to launch.
Eliminated comp-atition they gettin' bombed in the trunk.
Cause we keep 'em chunk in the trunk.
They gettin' bumped in the trunk.

The Grouch.
What can I learn from living life?
What can you learn from what I write?
I study till my lungs are bloody to him I'm just some Silly Puddy.
Who created me to play with, she to.
lay with, us to bust.
So I spend my day programming what...sounds?
How profound to rap into the break of dawn.
So they can hear and know it's on.
If the flow is strong it's smart.
If you're stupid it's not art.
Marks are made so many ways.
You can spin the tires, blaze a sack for everybody dazed.
A chapter is what you're after.

Zumbi: Gimmie what I need gimmie what I need.
Grouch: To help them trace my tracks.
Z: Lord Gimmie what I need gimmie what I need.
G: To stand and face the facts.
Z: Lord Gimmie what I need gimmie what I need.
G: To lead them not astray.
Z: Gimmie what I need gimmie what I need.
G: To say what I got to say.

Grouch.
Now you can faze me with your laughter your smiles or your pain.
I feel your trials when I'm down and out or winning at the game.
No one to claim Creator yet the masses are perplexed.
Cause by life we're so impressed, we all wish we had a next.
And that's no matter how much I complain.
Really couldn't place no blame.
I'll just refrain try stayin' sane and hope you watch your aim.
I scope and got the flame.
To make and knock and sock the same.
Got to use the brain.
So I can lose the chains.

Zion I.
See Grouch you my guru leader.
So I don't need to pack no heater.
Like syrup you make this sweeter.
This ballad is beemer teeter.
I'm tryin' to find myself.
Look at reflections of everyone else.
Some of y'all might find that funny but do not know your wealth.
You make the world turn.
You make the fire burn.
You make the wind breeze.
The sinner fall to his knees.
Now that's some powerful.
And I speak my words truthfully.
As far as I know.
Yo we all got some of God's beauty.

Zumbi.
Let me crack my seventh seal don't.
rush.
Microphone's gotta get crush.
I thrust with the force of a rocket buster.
This ain't what you're use to.
Now we gonna fly high singin this song la la la.
If you don't believe in yourself you best to try.
Ain't nobody said this life is easy.
Everything a test.
Is you gonna do your best?
Hide in the cone of flesh?
You got to stay fresh.
Cause if you stop you stagnated.
Stale thoughts of lack will put you in a jail.
Believe I can and I will.
Set these rhymes to sail.
But will what I really feel pay the bill shit is ill.
I stare off in the distance.
Rhymin' with persistence.
Cause rhymin' is a mission.
Will anybody listen?

The Grouch.
Now if you put me through any time of need.
I'm sure I'll call for help indeed.
Daily I stay silent, thinking thoughts at lightening speed.
Heightened by the feedback and forth reciprocation.
Situation rather unexplained I remain relations.
In laymens it's a vibe I felt.
De ja' vu inside myself.
I speak it verbally.
Made sure all them fools have heard of me.
Believe I'm well connected.
Not a prophet who's been resurrected.
Trust and I expect it.
When I bust it's higher effects to match your spects.
Of my blue prints and the true sense of these words.
God he lives within, all of this he's heard.
Every word.
