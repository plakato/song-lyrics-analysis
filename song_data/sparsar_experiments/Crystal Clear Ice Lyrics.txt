Crystal Clear Ice Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Cr-cr-crystal clear ice, I'm feelin' like the snow, man.
When I came through, everybody seemed so slow, man.
The loud makes me slow, man.
I do this for my snowmen.
I don't want to answer.
I don't like to use my phone, man.
Crystal clear ice, I'm feelin' like the snow, man.
When I came through, everybody seemed so slow, man.
The loud makes me slow, man.
I do this for my snowmen.
I don't want to answer.
I don't like to use my phone, man.

Life through ice, so excite, couldn't refresh my eyes.
Taken by surprise, I'm soo high, I'm in paradise.
Walkin' to the castle, every row, bumpin' section side.
Even though I'm high, all I got on me is loud.
Bitch I got it twice, I'm back for the price.
Starship 'round my ice, I got crystal, crystal ice.
Wet came through, ya know I wanna know the price.
I used to fantasize about this when I was five.
Crystal clear ice, man I'm fellin' like the snowman.
When I walk out, they sit in the front row, man.
Shouts to my team and everybody that I know, man.
They will always try and can't catch me, but they're too slow, man.

Cr-cr-crystal clear ice, I'm feelin' like the snow, man.
When I came through, everybody seemed so slow, man.
The loud makes me slow, man.
I do this for my snowmen.
I don't want to answer.
I don't like to use my phone, man.
Crystal clear ice, feelin' like the snow, man.
When I came through, everybody seemed so slow, man.
The loud makes me slow, man.
I do this for my snowmen.
I don't want to answer.
I don't like to use my phone, man.
