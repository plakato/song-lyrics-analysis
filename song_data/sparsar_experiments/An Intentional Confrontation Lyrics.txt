An Intentional Confrontation Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.

Mary:.
Where are you now?
Nikki: Feeling small..
Can't live without it?
You call this your best?
Nikki: I made my life a mess..
And everyone but you sees it.
Nikki: What a fool..
What are you gonna do.
Make more excuses?
Why don't you tie it off?
Nikki: Hang myself?
End your pathetic little life!

Mary:.
What is your life worth now?
Is this what you pictured for yourself?
Do you understand anything?

Mary:.
You're not there yet.
You're not anywhere yet.
Nikki: Am I closer?
Go back....
Nikki: Am I closer?
Go back to your mountain.
