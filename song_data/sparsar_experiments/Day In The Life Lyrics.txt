Day In The Life Lyrics
by Swift Kirabo.

Swift.
It's just a day in the life.
Let me paint a picture for ya.
For on in tonight.
Hoping it goes down smooth and it turns out right.
Yeah, it's just a day in the life.

It's just a day in the life.
Let me paint a picture for ya.
For on in tonight.
Hoping it goes down smooth and it turns out right.
Yeah, it's just a day in the life.

Strictly.
Can't stand waking up at seven, hearing the alarm ring.
But i gotta get up, working for that cream.
Invested most of what i earned in my lifelong dream.
So i take a quick shower.
Have brekkie all in an hour.
Book studio in the evening,recording some power.
Then i roam, all alone through the city streets zoned.
Plying Nasir Jones on my.
Sony earphones.
Then im up in work.
Bored driving me berserk.
Me and P checking out the girls, the three fine clerks.
And i can't be doing this for the rest of my years.
Gotta get somewhere with this music, not fall into these careers.
Its a process for people to blend in their ears.
And over time it will happen, no matter how many veers.
Meet my lady, low key people are shady.
Now I'm in the studio spitting about life on the daily.

It's just a day in the life.
Let me paint a picture for ya.
For on in tonight.
Hoping it goes down smooth and it turns out right.
Yeah, it's just a day in the life.

Spex.

It's 7:30 in the morning.
Alarm calling.
I'm yawning cause i gotta be up in the morning.
There's no stalling cause i can't be late.
Im trying to out some cake on my plate, no time to waste.
I missed the bus and got splashed by a puddle.
Monday mornings always generate trouble.
The next bus is here, so im sitting at the rear.
With my headphones on, music in my ear.
I let the bass take away the stress.
Cause this nine to five thirty is a pain in the neck.
But i ride it out cause the bank balance is blessed.
And that girl opposite me with the low cut vest.
As i glance at the clock i see that it's that time.
To head home,kick back and work on my mind.
Unwind,sit down and pass the time.
Cause when the sun rise ill be back on the grind.

It's just a day in the life.
Let me paint a picture for ya.
For on in tonight.
Hoping it goes down smooth and it turns out right.
Yeah, it's just a day in the life.

It's just a day in the life.
Let me paint a picture for ya.
For on in tonight.
Hoping it goes down smooth and it turns out right.
Yeah, it's just a day in the life.
