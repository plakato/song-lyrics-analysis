Cul-De-Sac Lyrics
by Zoetic.


Zoetic's gunna kill this one....

Only trust a few friends, try to make a tight circle, cause a secret they can.
keep boy.
No rest for the wicked gotta always watch my back i hold my pistol when i.
sleep boy.
These rocks on my neck be like the asteroid belt, black diamonds ain't cheap.
boy.
Beef in the pot.
Just to thicken the plot.
Anonymous tip to the cops.
Cause they heard gunshots.
I was in the trap spot, cookin' up the rocks.
Throw the bread on the ground watchin' all the birds flock.
Ridin' round in the whip, nothin' is stock.
Tints on the window all eyes on me like pac.
Ballin out like i'm Chris Paul, clippers guard.
You a pussy when you rap, needa get yourself some snicker bars.
But as for me, i be comin' up wit wicked bars.
Throwin' fire like a wizard runnin' on this jawn wall.
Zac of all trades the young hit maker.
Take more shots than kobe from the lakers gettin' paper.
If you a fiend then hit me cause i got what you need.
But don't trip cause i'm strapped wit that rocket yao mean.
Beastin' like spike, on the beat i'm like a wolverine.
Freeze the fluid in both knees, d rose on the scene.
Bust the Rondo cause you know its all about the fuckin' green.
Attitude Lebron James, imma go and carry the team!
Yup!
Theres nothin' you can say boy.
Couldn't kill me wit any kind of gun that you spray boy.
Turn yo pockets into bunny ears, i'm like a playboy.
Im the master you my dogs, i tell them bitches stay boy.
Now go fetch it, gimme paw, sit down.
Actin reckless, chainsaws, sit down!
When i touch ground i greet it wit a fist pound.
Fifths round, buy the whole bar a couple rounds.
F you comin' wit that yak! i hit ya misses wit them clip rounds.
Lookin' at you laughin' who's the muthafuckin' bitch now?!
Three mixtapes bodied i deserve a fuckin' trips crown.
Why you mad? Cause i'm buzzin' and i got that mixed sound.
Say you keep movin' forward, my ass, you in a standstill.
All you shit you talkin' get you found in a landfill.
Deaf to the haters im swingin' like Matt Hamill.
Give em a toe tag to match his nike sandals.
No button on me bruh i serious never can chill.
Have a black bitch drown you in the tank like landfill.
Throw you in a dumpster.
Leave ya body wit punctures.
Let the chopper bring the thunder.
I bet one'll do a number.
On ya arm, leg leg, arm, dental, arteries and torso.
Spell it out, i want alladat, hang you by a cord so.
I don't fuck wit you a little, minuscule, or even morsel.
Black magic wit the pot, ingestin' souls till i'm immortal.
Cannons blast, barrels flash, come and take a fuckin' photo.
Comin' for ya stash.
Stuff ya body in the dash.
Like a car collision crash.
In the dead end like a fuckin' cul-de-sac.
Real rap.
Gun charge, still strapped.
Actin gassed cause these trap boys rappin' all about the crack?
We ain't havin' none of that, NA!
