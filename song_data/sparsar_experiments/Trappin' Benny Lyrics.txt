Work on the work with the work on a worst days, 
Me and TrapBenny in the trap. Benny 
Word around LA Gleechie got the boof on the way back to D.C 
PCP northeast aka, Gleechie 
All that money that you got

Making moves in the industry.

Work with the work you young nigga. You can't get next too me 
Yous a poo pock ass nigga. That'S still sucking teeth: 
 
Oooh in the coupe

Sliding through my hood, I got nothin else to prove 
Riding round the hood. With my Glock, Like I got something else too: loose
 
Boof bag shawty, it's a lotta, fuckin goop 
Gallons of the goop I got bool
