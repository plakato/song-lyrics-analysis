Brooklyn Lyrics
by Woodkid.


Buying some vintage records in Williamsberg stores.
Playing paper boats on east river.
shores.
Meeting mermaids and lobsters in Coney Island.
Puking our deep fried Oreos in Astroland.
Spending our days watching skylines from rooftops.
On Independence Day, Manhattan fireworks.
Life is easier where the walls are red.
Brooklyn is a place stuck in my head.
Here in Paris the rain is falling.
My heart belongs to Brooklyn.

I'm sick of four star food, I want to be where life is.
As simple as two bucks pizza slices.
I swear I'll tell you, next time I knock at your door.
That I am not leaving Brooklyn anymore.
Would it be that nice if you were not part of it?
Would Brooklyn be worth crossing the Atlantic.
Life is easier where we can join our hands.
Your face is a face that's stuck in my head.
Here in Paris rain is falling.
My heart belongs to Brooklyn.

Life is easier where we can join our hands.
Your face is a face that's stuck in my head.
Here in Paris rain is falling.
My heart belongs to Brooklyn.
