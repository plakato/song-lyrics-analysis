False Idols Lyrics
by Unearth.

I never cared to know your name.
Roll out the red it's all the same.
False idols scream for our love.
Compete for stage devote for name.
It's all pathetically the same.
Convinced of starlight beauty.
A must watch all tune in.
A celebration heartache.
Hail false heroes.
Surrender to our envy.
No boundaries left untouched.
No passion left for memories.
No passion for real memories.
Here we stand.
Lessened are the far.
And few who sustain.
Protect and nurture.
Who stands before us.
We lay our lives down for the star.
Who stands before us.
As we speak.
We lay our lives down for the star.
It's all pathetically the same.
