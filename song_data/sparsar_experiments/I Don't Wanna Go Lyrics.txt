I Don't Wanna Go Lyrics
by The Undead.


What am I doing here?
I don't know.
Where are they taking me?
I don't wanna go.
They got a chain around my neck.
A dagger in my back.
Down a long, long corridor.
What am I doing here?
I don't know.
Where are they taking me?
I don't wanna go.
They got a chain around my neck.
A dagger in my back.
Down a long, long corridor.
I don't wanna go.
No, no, no.
I don't wanna go.
No, no, no.
I don't wanna go.
No, no, no.
I don't wanna go.
What am I doing here?
This can't be.
Whatever they want.
They want it outa me.
Strapped to a table.
Shaking like a leaf.
Drift into an endless sleep.
I don't wanna go.
No, no, no.
I don't wanna go.
No, no, no.
I don't wanna go.
No, no, no.
I don't wanna go.
What am I doing here?
I don't know.
Where are they taking me?
I don't wanna go.
They got a chain around my neck.
A dagger in my back.
Down a long, long corridor.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go, no.
I don't wanna go.
