Whatcha Gonna Do Lyrics
by Tyler Collins.


I remember when.
I was the center of your attention.
You made me love you.
With such sweet inspiration.

It seemed the world existed.
For only you and I.
You said I'd never shed a tear.
You'd never make me cry.

After one year.
How could things have changed?

It seems there's only one thing.
That you care about.
You don't even bother to call my name.
Until the lights go out.

What'cha gonna do.
When the lights go down.
And you want my loving?
I'll be on your mind.
But I won't be around.
Cause you're always bugging.

What'cha gonna do.
When you call my name.
And I don't come running?
What'cha gonna do?
What'cha gonna do?
When I'm not around.

It's true.
I'm a sucker for you.
But my mama didn't raise no fool.
And I'll only take some much neglect.
From a love I thought was true.

So this is my last plea.
I hope you listen to my cries.
Or you might just leave the bed one night.
To see a note that says goodbye.

Let's work this out.
I want our song to last.

So please take out the time.
And believe what I said.
Hope you find the answers.
Before you come to bed.

It seems like.
You're always messing around.
In the places you've got no business.
Seems like.
You're always letting me down.
Baby tell me.
