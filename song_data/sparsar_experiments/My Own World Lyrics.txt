My Own World Lyrics
by Aziz.

What am I? Who am I?
I'm heavily scrutinized.
They say, pick a nationality..
Either way I choose divides me.
There ain't no box for a brother like me.
I mean there is, but not one on the forms for my ID.
Bro, look at me, look at me, just a mixed black n***a.
Senegalese father, swear he just that n***a.
With a German moms, people asking her if I'm adopted.
Shed snap at 'em and tell 'em she birthed me without a problem.
What am I? Who am I? American I would suppose.
Lucky to have my name.
The masters couldn't strip those.
My fam still in the third world, in the ghettos.
So don't ask why I don't sleep man I'm out here to get dough.
So don't ask why im in the mall and I won't get those.
I'd rather buy a well, you would rather get O's.
I would rather get a green card, you would rather get low.
Now you on the baseline and you never get chose.

Hellooo, im in my own world.

I'm on my own terms.

And nobody lives there.

But me.

So Good bye.

I'm in my own world.

And there ain't no words.

To describe.

Me.

I'm In My Own World.

What am I? Who am I? I guess that I'm doing fine.
But there's so much that you don't know that I'll tell u I'm doing fine.

Cause that's just easier to say, easier to relay.
Its harder to say you hurting than you had a nice day.
It's easy to say you chilling its tougher to say you need help.
It's easy to make 'em drink its tougher to take they keys, hell.
Pass a friend a blunt, but you can't make him strap his seat belt?
My homie killed his passenger, we'll never know what he felt.
Ok I roll with wild boys, WB's the squad though.
But we all on our s**t though, and that's something we all know.
If one goes, we all go.
They got my fingerprints down, looking for my soul.
Asking, who am I?, acting like they know.
In my thoughts I drown, I see all the sounds.
My fingerprints are down, down.

Hellooo, im in my own world.

I'm on my own terms.

And nobody lives there.

But me.

So Good bye.

I'm in my own world.

And there ain't no words.

To describe.

Me.

I'm In My Own World.

It's like Another world that we're living in.
I Hope you Hold strong never giving in.
Cause They gon try to change you.
Try and rearrange you.
All For they own benefit.
Man You are in sole control of your future.
Please so don't let me down.
We've all had ups and downs.
Gotta turn that s**t around.
For me, for us, most importantly for you.
Cause you are the only one that's looking out for you.
But The higher I climb, the more there is to view.
Tryna to hold it together find the missing glue.
So nostalgic with the 40 ounce of brew.
To my people out there, you know I'm missing you.
I'm just a kid trying to make it in this s**t.
And To my fans, I'm thankful you exist.
Gotta say.

Hellooo, im in my own world.

I'm on my own terms.

And nobody lives there.

But me.

So Good bye.

I'm in my own world.

And there ain't no words.

To describe.

Me.

I'm In My Own World.
