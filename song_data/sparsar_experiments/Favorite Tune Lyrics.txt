Favorite Tune Lyrics
by The Swellers.

I used to spit more than I sold.
I'm glad I helped you out.
I'm waiting for.
Another sign.
From god or a speaker of mine.
Every time I broke down I said.
There's too many drugs at the hospital.
Never let me break down again.
Everyone could, no one ever does.
I can see gray skies ahead.
Every time I fell, you always knew my favorite tune.
I've never had a friend like you before.
You chill me out.
So I'll turn it down.
My services.
So you can hear the things they might have missed.
Every time I broke down I said.
There's too many drugs at the hospital.
Never let me break down again.
Everyone could, no one ever does.
I can see gray skies ahead.
Every time I fell, you always knew my favorite tune.
Always knew my favorite tune.
Sometimes I feel the lucky ones just fade away.
I can see gray skies ahead.
Every time I fell, you always knew my favorite tune.
Always knew my favorite tune.
Always knew my favorite tune.
Always knew my favorite tune.
