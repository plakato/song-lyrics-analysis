Can't Be My Lady Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.

Wooh Da Kid.
You should come and fuck with me but you can't be my lady.
F.U.C.K.I.N.G., we be fucking crazy.
Girl you got me burning up, cooler lips'll cool me off.
Going hard, not going soft.
She get a lot, but cravin' more.

Wooh Da Kid.
Don't go through my phone, bitch you know I got pictures.
Ho you know I got hoes, looking all through my pictures.
Pocket full of rubbers, going all through my pockets.
Looking all through my texts, I swear this bitch be jocking.
On the phone with her old man, while she getting this new dick.
Used to fuck her old friends, she said she love my music.
I said I love that pussy baby, you should throw it back.
Backwoods and some ganja baby, you should roll this pack.
I'm a cut throat, I'mma take that pussy.
I'mma break that pussy, I'mma shut shit down.
She know I'm the kid, she know I'm the king, I deserve that crown.
F.U.C.K.I.N.G., we be fucking crazy.
Every time we going hard she pray she have my baby.

Suck my dick 'bout two times, wanna fuck this dick 'bout four times.
You tripping shawty, you not mine.
Ain't no cuffing ho, get off my line.
Time and time again I had to tell you to stay off my phone.
You bugging, just leave me 'lone.
I suggest you take your ass home.
Shawty got me miss her cause I said I love her pussy.
Now she stuck on me, obsessed with me, stalking shit in the bushes.
Your Barbie coulda' fooled me, but after jaw shawty you useless.
Suck my dick like you was toothless, then blew the top, you roofless.
Top five shawty, she the truth with it.
Sloppy jaw, she loose lips.
Finger in the butt, she cool with it.
Spray her in the face like Cool Whip.
F.U.C.K.I.N.G., we be fucking brazy.
Fucked her with a rubber on, you can't have my baby.
