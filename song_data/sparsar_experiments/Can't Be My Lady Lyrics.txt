Can't Be My Lady Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.

Wooh Da Kid 
You should come and fuck with me, but you can't be my lady 
F.U.C.K.I.N.G.. We be fucking crazy 
Girl. You got me burning up cooler, lips'll cool me off 
Going hard, not going soft 
She get a lot but cravin' more 
, 
 Wooh Da Kid 
Don't go through my phone bitch. You know I got pictures 
Ho. You know I got hoes looking all through my pictures. 
Pocket full of rubbers going all through my pockets, 
Looking all through my texts. I swear this bitch be jocking 
On, the phone with her old man. While she getting this new dick 
Used to fuck her old friends. She said she love my music 
I said. I love that pussy baby. You should throw it back 
Backwoods and some ganja baby. You should roll this pack 
I'm a cut throat I'mma. Take that pussy 
I'mma break that pussy I'mma shut shit down. 
She know I'm the kid she know, I'm the king. I deserve that crown 
F.U.C.K.I.N.G.. We be fucking crazy, 
Every time we going hard, she pray. She have my baby 
 
Suck, my dick'bout two times wan na fuck, this dick'bout four times 
You tripping shawty, you not mine, 
Ain't, no cuffing ho get off my line. 
Time and time again, I had to tell you to stay off my phone 
You bugging just leave. Me'Lone 
I suggest you take your ass home 
Shawty got me miss her cause. I said I love her pussy 
Now. She stuck on me obsessed with me, stalking shit in the bushes 
Your Barbie coulda' fooled me, but after jaw shawty you useless 
Suck. My dick, like you, was toothless, then blew the top. You roofless 
Top, five shawty. She the truth with it 
Sloppy jaw she loose lips 
Finger in the butt she cool with it 
Spray her in the face like Cool Whip 
F.U.C.K.I.N.G., we be fucking brazy 
Fucked her with a rubber on. You can't have my baby
