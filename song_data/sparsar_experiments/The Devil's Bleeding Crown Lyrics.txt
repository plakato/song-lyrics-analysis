The Devil's Bleeding Crown Lyrics
by Volbeat.


Falling from the sky, they're cast out from the heaven's light.
Drenching the soil with blood, baptized in the fire hole.

The Devil's spawn no longer breathes.
Descending angels and fallen kings.
Raise your hands, what do you hold?
The Devil's bleeding crown!

Call upon it's Father, bless the goat, the womanizer.
Take him to Astaroth, Inanna's temple of Uruk.

The Devil's spawn no longer breathes.
Descending angels and fallen kings.
Raise your hands, what do you hold?
The Devil's bleeding crown!

They gathered all the children outside the church.
And never would they know what went on in there.
Close the door and hear all the angels scream.
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, oh mercy, please!
Down, down, down.
Down below you can hear his hoof digging through the ground.
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord.
The horned one is back and he wants his crown!

The Devil's spawn no longer breathes.
Descending angels and fallen kings.
Raise your hands, what do you hold?
The Devil's bleeding crown!
