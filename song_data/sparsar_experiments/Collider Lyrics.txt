Collider Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


Move your hands in slow motion, slow motion, slow motion, slow motion for me.
Feel the devil's approaching, approaching, approaching, approaching me.
Move your head in slow motion, slow motion, slow motion, slow motion for me.
Two objects collide.
No one will survive.

Collide.
Collide.
Collide.
Collide.

Feel the burst, it keeps haunting me, haunting me, haunting me, haunting me.
Come in close, it holds onto me, onto me, onto me, onto me.
But I turn my grave, you could long to me, long to me, long to me, long to me.
As we look in your eyes.
You don't have long to survive.

Collide.
Collide.
Collide.
Collide.
