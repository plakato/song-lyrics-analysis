Hells Kitchen Freestyle Lyrics
by Rwhisky Champ.

Okay the name is Champion girl,I came through with a bang bang girl,you know.
what i do girl,i'm a rap artist hahaha,okay i do what i gotta do,my name ain't.
gotta be forgoten girl,wearing bloody apron in the kitchen,with a nigga head.
on the table,i just slaughtered a nigga no question,not even talking,i'd be.
shutting up girl like i ain't gotta talk i'm a samurai,i kick ass Jet Li shit.
pause.
She told me put it in the back Champ but i want it in front,she told me that.
she wanna ride,i told her that is dangerous,full speed,i'm really going really.
hard,i don't stop coz i know what she really want,i don't wanna brag,but them.
girls love me,okay i'm done with that loving shit now it all a game girl Go!!
