Oh My God Lyrics
by Two Crown King.


Posted to coffee stop. Knock it off; you're on the clock.
Don't make me get another camera, kid. We love to watch.
They got you nervous wet with nervous sweat and scared to stop.
Burning the candle they made you purchase to earn your spot.
So bye haters. It's a cliche to say. I know this is your -.
\- hiatus. Is the place that we wake.

Now you're never going to get that back -.
\- cause you can't put a square in around hole, stupid.
???. No Johny Ballin'.

Oh my god!
Oh my god!

Taken me so long to factor out time put in.
No matter. Won't get back. ????
Wondering why, man. I'm fine, man. I'm fucking cool.
Itty-bitty minds make me mindless. No golden rule.
I'll climb my way back up. I'll knock a couple down.
???

This one. That one. They can't have fun.
So you can fucking suck a fat one.

Long gone, and left behind -.
\- four rounds and finish line.

And they want to go it? Well fine. Fuck if I care.
Blow me your kisses at candles. Half man, half chandelier.
Eighty-four months in and random Wednesday ???
A package of papers put in my hand as they ask me to go.
??? can't get my hand, cause I'm part of an army.
67 soldiers and I'm honoured they honour me.

Oh my god!
Oh my god!
