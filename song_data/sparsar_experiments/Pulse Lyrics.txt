Pulse Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Ou would hide a face of pain.
Laugh at all the hurt before you.
Nothing would cloud your smile.
You were stronger than me.
When she graced your life you changed.
Past erased by a new-found presence.
Walls that you once had built.
Fell when she arrived.
There came a beast, tore out your heart.
Drained your blood while I watched.
Before my eyes, you were destroyed.
Left me there on my own.
At times I did think you'd heal.
When I saw the strength in your eyes.
That glimpse would bring me hope.
A beacon in the night.
Soon hope would fade and you'd fall apart.
Fallen angel of mine.
Before our eyes, you were destroyed.
Left us there on our own.
Fell down, fell down.
I reached out for your light.
Failed to stay strong.
As you let go of life.
Not sure that time will heal.
All the pain and hurt we suffered.
Still, now is far from then.
Nurtured by her laughter.
Caged in your heart, striving to be.
The beast will always haunt you.
Wounds of the past shall bleed again.
But you will heal by our side.
Fell down, fell down.
I reached out for your light.
Failed to stay strong.
As you let go of life.
Failed to stay strong.
But I will hold you now.
