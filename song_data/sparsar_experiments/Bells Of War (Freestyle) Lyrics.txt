Bells Of War (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Akala.

Let me give you some real shit for a second.
Yo, listen....

Five hundred years of tears, we still here.
Standing strong, the only thing that we fear.
The reflection in the mirror, the hate is deep.
It's been this way since Willie Lynch made the speech.
Divide and rule got us all by the balls.
The referee's cheatin', but we playin' by the rules.
Even after all the rape and the killing.
We still let the same man educate our children.
There's been no apology, we still forgivin'.
And he's got the cheek to portray us as the villain.
Look across the globe at the way we are livin'.
The darker the skin, the realer the condition, no coincidence.
We built the whole western world for free.
And what thank you did we get? To be hung from trees?
We been whipped, been stripped of our truth.
But we still standin', a tree without roots.
Black rose from the concrete, the petals is damaged.
But surely you see the beauty of what just happened.
What don't kill you, make a nigga strong, that's a fact.
And we've been abused for so long, you do the math.
