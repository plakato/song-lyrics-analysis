A13 Trunk Road to the Sea Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

If you ever have to go to Shoeburyness.
Take the A road, the okay road that's the best.
Go motorin' on the A13.

Well, if you're looking for a thrill that's new.
Take in Fords, Dartford Tunnel and the river too.
Go motorin' on the A13.

It starts down in Wapping.
There ain't no stopping.
By-pass Barking and straight through Dagenham.
Down to Grays Thurrock.
And rather near Basildon.
Pitsea, Thundersley, Hadleigh, Leigh-On-Sea.
Chalkwell, Prittlewell.
Southend's the end.

If you ever have to go to Shoeburyness.
Take the A road, the okay road that's the best.
Go motorin' on the A13.

It starts down in Wapping.
There ain't no stopping.
By-pass Barking and straight through Dagenham.
Down to Grays Thurrock.
And rather near Basildon.
Pitsea, Thundersley, Hadleigh, Leigh-On-Sea.
Chalkwell, Prittlewell.
Southend's the end.

If you ever have to go to Shoeburyness.
Take the A road, the okay road that's the best.
Go motorin' on the A13.
Go motorin' on the A13.
Go motorin' on the A13.
