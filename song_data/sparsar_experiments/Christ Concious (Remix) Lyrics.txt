Christ Concious (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

Christ, concious 
High, when my tri 
Eye balled em 
I accidentally popped off 
In, yo, ipod, again 
Whats this shit with bitches 
And, not wantin, to swallow it 
Its, whatever tho 
Prepared for a better flow 
Ya, know: 
This shits, incredible 
Like, a LSD, laced, edible 
How many enemies Want a enima 
In, the cinema 
Dont enter my vacinity 
Unless ya, brought protection, wit, ya, 
Baby 
Mixed, a couple pills, 
With, the liquor 
And. I just might hit ya 
Im the mic: killa 
Side beside the villa 
My scrilla 
The, horizon of my sight, 
Is, the hight of like 5 buildins 
Yall sets killin son 
So. I won't let the sun set 
Until. We reach on million 
Nah 
Until. We reach christ, concious 
 
If, you werent scared. 
What. Would you do 
I might just get a knife: 
And poke a man 
Like a mew ooh 
Look at all these faggots 
Clone, my sytle, like a mewtwo 
Im too, live in the buildin 
Like a motherfuckin news, crew. 
Yall thought yall rap, like kendrick 
But. All im hearin is doodoo 
Like *kendrick, gunshot, ad-lib*, 
A crip'll get crippled. 
Keep askin me about yo blues clues 
A blood'll get bloody. If yall 
Dont tell me what the rules do, 
Put you and me inside a boxing ring. 
And figure whos, who 
I got the munchies for money 
Ain't noone, i won't chew, threw 
And. I won't stop until im in a mansion, 
With a moon roof 
Nah 
Until. We reach christ, concious 
 
In order to get a loan 
You need to prove that you dont need one 
Yall paws got 
Cerebral palsy compared to how we run 
Starin at the city, 
Suddely sayin, that he won 
My bitch and a blunt 
Just to let you know. I only need one 
And fuck, these bitches on 
Dramas older than re-runs 
Yall thinkin. He could defeat us. 
Ill beat him like a fetus 
With cleets on a fuckin 
Speed bump 
We is the streets. 
I mean g. Is us 
I mean jesus 
And? I won't stop until im in a 
Wuick whip wit, the top down 
Get it jesus 
Nah 
Until. We reach christ, concious
