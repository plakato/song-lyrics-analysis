Christ Concious (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

Christ concious.
High when my tri.
Eye balled em.
I accidentally popped off.
In yo ipod again.
Whats this shit with bitches.
And not wantin to swallow it.
Its whatever tho.
Prepared for a better flow.
Ya know.
This shits incredible.
Like a LSD laced edible.
How many enemies want a enima.
In the cinema.
Dont enter my vacinity.
Unless ya brought protection wit ya.
Baby.
Mixed a couple pills.
With the liquor.
And i just might hit ya.
Im the mic killa.
Side beside the villa.
My scrilla.
The horizon of my sight.
Is the hight of like 5 buildins.
Yall sets killin son.
So i won't let the sun set.
Until we reach on million.
Nah.
Until we reach christ concious.

If you werent scared.
What would you do.
I might just get a knife.
And poke a man.
Like a mew ooh.
Look at all these faggots.
Clone my sytle like a mewtwo.
Im too live in the buildin.
Like a motherfuckin news crew.
Yall thought yall rap like kendrick.
But all im hearin is doodoo.
Like *kendrick gunshot ad-lib*.
A crip'll get crippled.
Keep askin me about yo blues clues.
A blood'll get bloody if yall.
Dont tell me what the rules do.
Put you and me inside a boxing ring.
And figure whos who.
I got the munchies for money.
Ain't noone i won't chew threw.
And i won't stop until im in a mansion.
With a moon roof.
Nah.
Until we reach christ concious.

In order to get a loan.
You need to prove that you dont need one.
Yall paws got.
Cerebral palsy compared to how we run.
Starin at the city.
Suddely sayin that he won.
My bitch and a blunt.
Just to let you know i only need one.
And fuck these bitches on.
Dramas older than re-runs.
Yall thinkin he could defeat us.
Ill beat him like a fetus.
With cleets on a fuckin.
Speed bump.
We is the streets.
I mean g is us.
I mean jesus.
And i won't stop until im in a.
Wuick whip wit the top down.
Get it jesus?
Nah.
Until we reach christ concious.
