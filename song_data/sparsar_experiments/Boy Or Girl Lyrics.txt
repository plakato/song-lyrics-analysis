Boy Or Girl Lyrics
by Yung DSJ.


If I have a girl, I pray she won't be nothing like none of these girls I have.
met throughout my life.
Treat her now to be a lady with a swag jus like her mother.
Treat her to be independent, j-j-just me and my daughter now.
If I have a boy I hope he don't be nothing like me when I was younger,.
thought I knew a lot about life.
Teach him how to be a man, teach him how to be strong.
Tell him how to treat a woman j-j-just me and my son.

Now I can't lie it's gon be a couple years.
Fore I see your face hd crystal clear.
I think about it now n sometimes I jus tear.
The thought of You sayin daddy is like heaven to my ears.
Now if she's a girl you gon be daddy's Lil baby.
Never be like them stay a classy Lil lady.
Plan on giving you the biggest hugs and add a couple kisses.
And hopefully I'll still be in love with the misses.
Yea that's Yo mommy but you daddy's little girl.
And daddy's one job is to let you have the world.
And baby You got it so you ain't ever gotta worry.
I'll still tuck u in at nite and read your favorite story.
I can get u all the barbies and any other toys.
All I ask is you stay away from all these Lil boys.
With one thing on their mind but we'll get into that later.
Just know that I'm your father I ain't talkin darth vader.

If I have a boy I'll promise he look like me.
Always looking fly never not looking clean.
Always be supportive on your every little dream.
Just know you can be whatever it is u wanna be.
N I always got your back plzzzz remember that.
Whether it's tryna be in movies or hopping on daddy's track.
I'mma let you do it any dreams just know u can pursue it.
Just keep your dedication and never ever lose it.
I promise you'll make it through it and daddy never lied.
Hop outside the crib you can bet u match my fly.
Don't worry I got ya son you'll be flyer than the sky.
Then you'll be so used to it u won't even have to try.
N one thing I'll teach u is to always respect your girl.
Show her your the best n make sure that she's your world.
But we'll get into that later cuz this conversation ain't done.
Just know I'll always be your father u my son.
