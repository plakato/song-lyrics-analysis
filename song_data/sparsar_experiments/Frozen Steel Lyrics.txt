Frozen Steel Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Beyond the tundra and past the sea, a people have risen tall, soaring past the.
barriers that their kind have faced.
And driving them on, a strength that can't be stilled.
Tales have been told of how they won their home.

Warriors, ungodly worshipers of cold.
Warriors, of ice and snow.
Warriors, the frozen north is where they ride.
Warriors, of ice and snow, of ice and snow.

Fight for what you believe, no one can take that which can not be held by the.
hand.
Honor and faith, the strongest armor.
Cry across distant hills, stand with your brothers in metal against tyranny.
Swords in the air; rise and vanquish.
Braving the northern winds to be on the front lines, as soldiers unite, to.
carry the torch.

Warriors, ungodly worshipers of cold.
Warriors, of ice and snow.
Warriors, the frozen north is where they ride.
Warriors, of ice and snow, of ice and snow.
Warriors, ungodly worshipers of cold.
Warriors, of ice and snow.
Warriors, the frozen north is where they ride.
Warriors, of ice and snow, of ice and snow.
