Lucifer's Friend Lyrics
by Vision.

My eyes burn in the darkness.
Waiting outside your home.
A life that's truly immortal.
A lord of the unknown.
I only go out in the evening.
Never seeing the sun.
Draining the blood from my victims.
To give me the strength to go on.

Vanishing just as the dawn comes.
In vaults below the ground.
Taking life from the humans.
A circle that goes round and round.
I'll never strike when expected.
I'm just a shadow at night.
My victims' eyes full of horror.
As they feel the terror and fright.

My eyes burn in the darkness.
Waiting outside your home.
A life that's truly immortal.
A lord of the unknown.
I only go out in the evening.
Never seeing the sun.
Draining the blood from my victims.
To give me the strength to go on.
