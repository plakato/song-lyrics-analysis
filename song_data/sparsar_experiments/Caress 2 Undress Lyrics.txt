Caress 2 Undress Lyrics
by Vizzi.


Sex gets rougher 
When, it comes to the nut buster 
If, I'm caressing em' 
I'm undressing em' 
Little, dress, combo, leggings, silver, lipstick 
Come for my rhythm in the bed... Yes, 
Settle down to the testing. God bless her 
Look. Her look her in the eyes. I caress undress. Her 
I'ma I'ma see the show she puts on that. Lingerie 
I'll serve sports. It'S a goal, let em' know babe 
 
Hi. My name is Vante definition of V-Day 
Let me. Take your V-Card racing, your curves no relay 
Lick the icing off. Even though it's not your b-day 
And cut the cake so good make you wan na do a replay 
When I get inside your thighs. Please don't try
