John Michael (Thalab Remix) Lyrics
by Russian Red.

This is hidden love.
Something that we used to play.
Running up and down the stairs.
Kisses down the porch.

How do we spoke?
Settled all the basic terms.
And figured out the limit age.
For this love to stop.

O oh, I wish I could afford your stupid charm, your stupid voice.
O oh, I wish I could afford your stupid charm, your stupid voice.

This is clumsy love.
Something that we cannot race.
Confusing as a burning chest.
Competing for the crown.

How do we spoke?
Ohhh, for this love to stop.

O oh, I wish I could afford your stupid charm, your stupid voice.
Oh, your stupid voice.

O oh, I wish I could afford your stupid charm, your stupid.
Ahhh ohh, I could afford your stupid charm, your stupid voice.
O ho, I wish I could afford your stupid charm, your stupid voice.
