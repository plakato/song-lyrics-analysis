Don't Forget Where You Came From Lyrics
by Swoop G.

**.

Fuck you Snoop.
Live and offical.
Uh.
Direct.
Death Row.
Yeah.
Dynasty nigga.
Holla back.
Death Row is a franchise, a legacy.
New beginning, is the ending of you.
I done wrote this shit.
The new generation.
Find 'em nigga, where you at?
Ha.
Yeah.

You know my niggas runnin.
What you juss doin.
We been an done it.
Pushin V-12 600's.
Puffin lovin my women.
Diamonds shinin priceless on my neck.
I ain't spent a big face yet.
Still spendin small faces from that '92 spot.
Dr. Dre thanks a lot for that Chronic you dropped.
Now I'm droppin mine in '99.
The present is mine.
In the year two-thous, please believe we holdin it down.
Polish the crown.
Bustin the rounds.
Get the fuck down.
Movin the crowd.
Make the sqares act right now.
Me an Suge.
I'm the ace in the hole.
Makin the doe.
For my dog Mr. Knight I pray you get parole.
An to that bitch-made nigga Snoop Doggy hoe.
I'll get at you in the hood.
You ain't the homie no mo'.
An this ain't about Death Row.
It's about the set.
Holla back an you can meet me on some Reno bet.

You can shine in yo time.
But I'ma shine the hardest.
Death Row, diamonds reward.
The number one artist.
Long Beach is a dynasty.
And Swoop is in his prime.
You know I'm holdin down mine.
Fake niggas you know the time.
It's crucial.
The feelings mutual.
So when I see you, I'ma shoot you.
Niggas will swear that I never knew you.
Ah!
I can't believe you would do what you've done.
Cross Death Row and forget where you from.
Uh.

**.

Snoop ain't never had a Death Row piece cuz it's only fo ridas.
That's why he at that Dogg Pound shit.

That nigga fake as Pretty Tony.
The phony homie.
Give me ya Rollie.
The real homies droppin fools, shinin like gold D's.
Best believe baby boy we gettin our cheese.
You juss a weenie Snoop Dogg.
So tuck ya tail and leave.
And we makin moves.
You gettin used.
Battered an bruised.
I fill in your shoes.
So there it is, touch it or lose.
Cuz you can't handle.
What I do.
Callin shots.
And come bustin at your homeboys too.
Lookin for you in the LBC pushin a Nav.
And it's in my lap.
I don't keep the heat in the dash.
License and permitt so if I see you it's meant.
For me to tear your head off on some murderous shit.
You simple minded.
Look at me shinin.
All in the doe.
After this I'm buyin a label.
And a studio.
I lost love for ya Snoop back then.
When Swoop bruised yo chin.
At the video shoot for the Twinz.

**.

At the Ampa Theatre.
Remember we gangstas.
So we mobbed in that mutha fucka in Chuck Taylor's and gators.
Pushin our weight.
Man we thought you niggas was tanks.
But we was flexin our muscles from the jump at the gate.
Now we inside.
When Death Row ride it's do or die.
Pushin the line.
Mashin like Pac an Suge Knight.
When he slapped you up.
You had to run to get 'em up.
One on one.
And I thought you niggas was soldiers.
Cuz if this was a war.
Man ya team would be dead.
You know how we get when we take that chronic to the head.
And we mixed it with liquor.
An the Nina's out to get ya.
It's ritz.
So loc you betta handle your shit.
And you know this ain't a game we playin.
I'm tellin ya mayne.
Don't make me pull this mutha fuckin strap out again.
Uh.

**.
