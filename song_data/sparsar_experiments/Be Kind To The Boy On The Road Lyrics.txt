Be Kind To The Boy On The Road Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

Who is that boy on the white winding highway?  .
Why does he roam alone?  .
Is he looking for life on that white winding highway?  .
For his parents dealt him trouble at home  .
  .
You might think he's wrong standing there on that highway  .
O' what a foolish young lad!  .
But you yourself might be standing on that highway  .
If you'd had his troubles on your hands  .
  .
Don't point your finger at that boy on the highway  .
As you travel down this road!  .
Either give him your help or pass him with kindness  .
Cause he's got all the trouble that he wants!  .
  .
Your policeman discourages that boy on the highway  .
It's heard everywhere that he goes!  .
But the best way to help that boy on the highway  .
Is to fix all your troubles there at home!  .
  .
I've heard it said 'bout rolling stone boys  .
They gather no moss in their life?  .
I'll tell you the bee that gets the honey  .
Ain't the bee that hands around the hive  .
  .
Oh be kind to that boy on that white winding highway  .
As you travel on there alone  .
Remember the men that wrote your Bible  .
Are the men who gave up their homes!.
.
