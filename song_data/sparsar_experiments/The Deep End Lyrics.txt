The Deep End Lyrics
by Twiztid.


It sits and corrodes in the bottomless pit of my soul.
Becoming half of the better damaged portion of what's whole.
Some call it sick, deranged, insane and sometimes.
I prefer it rather that to be just labeled this plain.
Or played like some disfigured chess piece.
In life's corrupted game.
Feel the sorrow.
Life reaps and sows, accepting it.
But still wanting to grow.
Or just let go but the grips from the fingertips.
Of insanity's overbearing hold.
Feels airtight.
As if I need the jaws of life to come and cut me.
Out the darkness in an effort to shed light on the subject.
To the public, the world can live without me.
Still feel blessed inside to speak my mind.
And hoping they never doubt me.
And through death hoping they remember.
And never ever will they ever forget about me.
And if I'm resurrected.
Second coming of second life.
Second chance to know about me to have sight.
Beyond sight, close your eyes and still see.

If I were just the same.
As the rest of you little robots.
Then I prefer to be shot.
Induce me with the pain.
Shoot venom in my veins.
Cause you don't know my story.
No, you don't know my story.
There's really nothing for me.
So leave me in this worry.

Feel like an 8 by 10 in a 5 by 7.
I'm in the wrong frame of mind.
And I wish my indiscretions had a warning sign.
But I get by.
And that's a lie.
But I gotta refuse to let em' know.
That on the line in which I ride.
I choose to break away.
Wanna bring it back.
That which you take from me.
Even if it means I gotta go to war with everyone.
Who wanted to end my little bit of everything.
Guess I'm too mad or too sad to sing.
I was born in a city.
But now I'm living in a confused state.
That's full of decay like a toothache.
They tried to pull me out but it was too late.
Now I'm a product of a brand new hate.
I'd rather die than be what you say.
Living a lie to let the truth hang.
Individualize me like a new gang.
While the rest of y'all just sit there and get played.

I'm drowning in a pool of my surroundings.
I put this knife to my Adam's apple.
Let's start the backwards countdown from ten.
I'm a tatted rascal.
Fleeting from the lines.
An acid jackal.
Shackles all on my palms.
Because psychedelic trips gone bad.
Recollections of my pissed off dad.
Sitting in the pathfinder.
And I still ain't found shit but.
Old silhouetted pictures of me with my wrist cut.
And I wish you well.
Hell, I was bullied by the minotaur.
School with a crew.
With a toolie.
Inside a rental car.
You don't learn from god inside a seminar.
But you hear about the devil every which way you turn.
Perhaps we were made to burn in hellfire.
And I desire to be stronger.
But the songs I sing.
Go ever somber in this life of mine.
Memoirs of the suicidal.
I guess my father is my truest idol.
Gone.
