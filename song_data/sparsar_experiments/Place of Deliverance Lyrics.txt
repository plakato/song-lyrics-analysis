Place of Deliverance Lyrics
by Voice.

I hear a whisper in my dreams.
Every night and it seems.
Seems so real, I can feel it.

The voice told me from a strange land.
People living hand in hand.
With hearts so clear.
And without fear.
In mind so far away.

Show me the place where we faithfully arise.
Where hope never dies.
Where I can touch the sky.
Deliver my soul, deliver my heart from pain.
I'm not afraid.
I swear I will remain.

I see the shine in your eyes.
And feel the warmth of your soul.
So intimate, so far from hate.

Let us kindle the magical spark now.
That the embers don't go out.
Until eternity.
We will be free.
In minds so far away.

Show me the place where we faithfully arise.
Where hope never dies.
Where I can touch the sky.
Deliver my soul, deliver my heart from pain.
I'm not afraid.
I swear I will remain.

Show me the place where we faithfully arise.
Where hope never dies.
Where I can touch the sky.
Deliver my soul, deliver my heart from pain.
I'm not afraid.
I swear I will remain.
