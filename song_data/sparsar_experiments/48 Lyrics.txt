48 Lyrics
by Tyler.


Crack fucked up the world and I wonder if they realized the damage. 
I mean they come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit. 
I wonder if it fucked with their conscience, 
It fucked with me being out there. I couldn't stand it 
I. Couldn'T stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit 
And? That'S where the money came from
