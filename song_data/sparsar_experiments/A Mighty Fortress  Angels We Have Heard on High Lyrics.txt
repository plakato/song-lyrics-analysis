A Mighty Fortress  Angels We Have Heard on High Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Angel we have heard on high.
Sweetly singing o'er the plain.
And the mountains in reply.
Echoing their joyous strain.

Gloria.
In excellsis deo.
Gloria.
In excellsis deo.

Come to Bethlehem and see.
Him whose birth the angels sing.
Come adore on bended knee.
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King.

Gloria.
In excellsis deo.
Gloria.
In excellsis deo.

Gloria.
In excellsis deo.
