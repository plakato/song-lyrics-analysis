Let It Ride Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Movin' like the fog on the Cumberland River.
I was leaving on the Delta Queen.
And I wasn't ready to go.
I'm never ready to go.
Twenty-seven years of nothin' but failures and promises that I couldn't keep.
Oh lord I wasn't ready to go.
I'm never ready to go.
Let it ride.
Let it ride easy down the road.
Let it ride.
Let it take away all of the darkness.
Let it ride.
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home.
Let it ride.
Let it roll.
Let it go.

Loaded like a sailor.
Tumbling off a ferry boat.
I was at the bar till three.
Oh Lord, and I wasn't ready to go.
I'm never ready to go.
Tennessee's a brother to my sister Carolina where they're gonna bury me.

And I ain't ready to go.
I'm never ready to go.
Let it ride let it ride easy down the road.
Let it ride.
Let it take away all of this darkness.
Let it ride.
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home.
Let it ride.
Let it roll.
Let it go.

I want to see you tonight.
Dancing in the endless moonlight.
In the parking lot in the headlights of cars.
Someplace on the moon.
Where they moved the drive-in theater.
Where I left the car that I can't find but I still got the keys to.

Let it ride.
Let it ride easy down the road.
Let it ride.
Let it take away all of this darkness.
Let it ride.
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home.
Let it ride.
Let it roll.
Let it go.
