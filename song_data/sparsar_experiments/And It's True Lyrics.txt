And It's True Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Ain't it funny?
All the things I want in life.
Are here baby, ooh yeah.
But it's true girl.
They don't mean a thing.
If there's no you baby.

Cause all I know.
All the money in the world.
Can't buy me love.
Now what I want.
I should've know.
Money ain't what I wrong.
What's the point if I still can't have you?

And it's true.
All I ever wanted girl was you, yeah.
And it's true.
The only thing that matters girl is you yeah, ooh baby.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're my darling.
It's true girl.
Don't you know that it's you girl.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're my darling.
It's true girl.
Don't you know that it's you, yes you.

Ain't it funny?
I could have 'bout any girl in school, yeah.
Oh yes, but the joke's on me.
All that Kool-aid and I still don't have you yeah.

All I know.
All the girlies in the world.
Don't mean so much.
It ain't what I want.
And it shows.
Baby I'm so in love.
What's the point in love.
If I can't be with you.

And it's true.
All I ever wanted girl was you, yeah.
And it's true.
The only thing that matters girl is you yeah, ooh baby.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're my darling.
It's true girl.
Don't you know that it's you girl.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're my darling.
It's true girl.
Don't you know that it's you, yes you.

All I know.
All the girlies in the world.
Don't mean so much.
It ain't what I want.
And it shows.
Baby I'm so in love.
What's the point in love.
If I can't be with you.

And it's true.
All I ever wanted girl was you, yeah.
And it's true.
The only thing that matters girl is you yeah, ooh baby.

And it's true.
All I ever wanted girl was you, yeah.
And it's true.
The only thing that matters girl is you yeah, ooh baby.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're my darling.
It's true girl.
Don't you know that it's you girl.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're my darling.
It's true girl.
Don't you know that it's you, yes you.
