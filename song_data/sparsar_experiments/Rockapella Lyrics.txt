Rockapella Lyrics
by Swollen Members.

Prevail.
As 10,000 Maniacs emerge.
from an Oasis that's.
Everclear.
My Soundgarden was invented.
to Blind Melons and Smash.
Pumpkins.
How could a whole nation of Crash Test Dummies.
Hope to release their grapes of wrath.
On their day of Sabbath knowing it'll be Black.
Especially when They Might Be Giants.
And they take to the air with Stone Temple Pilots.
I man my parachute crew with the Mötley Crüe.
My B-52 fires Nine Inch.
Nails.
Radiohead, I cause phonetic.
Quiet Riots.
Untragically hip, fight.
with the spirit of the west.
Society's no fuckin use, your White Zombies have no effects.
Now Cowboys are turning into Junkies.
Hanging themselves with lassos.
And blues about rodeos that.
once stood true.
I don't have no time to fight with those fools.
Alice is in Chains and cold.
hearted Iron Maidens.
Claim their Ministries have.
The Cure for you too.

While everyone's Raging Against the Machine.
They're watching us on Satellites from Georgia.
But there's more in my set than Alanis.
And I won't crash into vegas cause my man smith has got the arrow.
The moral to this peril is hell hath no fury like MC's scorned.
