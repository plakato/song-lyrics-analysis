Only for tonight Lyrics
by Zinc.

Telling me the stories from the start again.
Sleeping off the night and do it all again.
Just wait and see.

Yes you.
You got something on your mind?
Hey you.
I will be yours if you like.
But only for tonight.
But only for tonight.
But only for tonight.
Just wait and see.

Telling me the stories from the start again.
Sleeping off the night and do it all again.
Just wait and see.

Yes you.
You got something on your mind?
Hey you.
I will be yours if you like.
But only for tonight.
But only for tonight.
But only for tonight.
Just wait and see.

Telling me the stories from the start again.
Sleeping off the night and do it all again.
Just wait and see.

Yes you.
You got something on your mind?
Hey you.
I will be yours if you like.
But only for tonight.
But only for tonight.
But only for tonight.
Just wait and see.
