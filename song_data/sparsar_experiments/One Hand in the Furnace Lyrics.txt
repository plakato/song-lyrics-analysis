One Hand in the Furnace Lyrics
by Wrinkle Neck Mules.

Living down the time spent subdivided by one effort or another.
And the grains are almost gone.
Sitting on the top there unmolested.
Then compressed into the middle.
And the longest of free falls.

Black out on a Tuesday.
You know that it ain't usually like the bottle to get us gone that far.

As the light was leaving, the darkness came creeping up behind us.
And covered up the falling of the stars.

All the good times and the bad luck never added up to much.
But a court date down in Farmville and one hand in the furnace.
Saturday replenishes what Sunday leaves behind.
We'll be alright.

Simple graces interlaced with sterile spaces.
And the sounds of all the barely hanging on.
Never was intended for my parts to be descended.
Cause a furrow in your brow.

All the good times and the bad luck never added up to much.
But a court date down in Farmville and one hand in the furnace.
Saturday replenishes what Sunday leaves behind.
We'll be alright.
Yeah, Saturday replenishes what Sunday leaves behind.
We'll be alright.
