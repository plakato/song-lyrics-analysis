All You'll Ever Get From Me Lyrics
by Sweet.

Got a sweet snap and juggle a pack.
It's very nice when it's going down.
But if you got time we don't need a dime.
We'll save our money for a house in town.

I'm talkin' about love , love.
All you'll ever get from me.
I'm talkin' about love , love.
All you'll ever got from me.

I'm talkin' about love , love.
All you'll ever got from me.
I'm talkin' about love , love.
All you'll ever got from me.

Cadillac car and blueberry jar.
It doesn't matter what your fancy is.
Cause when you're alone and nobody's home.
There's only one thing that you really miss.

I'm talkin' about love , love.
All you'll ever get from me.
I'm talkin' about love , love.
All you'll ever got from me.

Yeah, I'm talkin' about love , love.
All you'll ever got from me.
I'm talkin' about love , love.
All you'll ever got from me.
