Pasta w Butter Lyrics
by Uncommon Nasa.

Most cats never know times like these.
Counting degrees on a thermostat.
Ironic Good Times that's.
really wack.
Once again the roaches.
back.
Close the drawer so you won't see em.
Fumigation house-tent, no.
where to go.
In the flow steps flea infection.
Where they come from, nobody gets it.
Itchy head to toe, rashes low.
Emerge red from the bed, something to be said.
For this low rent, makes.
no sense, it's nonsense.
The worst apartment in the projects.
But hidden in a burb.
Garbage dump pumps fuming.
Existence is in ruin.
But we got, we got, we got, we got, we got.

Pasta with Butter.
Prepared by my Mother.
Those Ronzoni sweet.
shells.
Know Mom's only meant well.

My whole existence is a question mark.
Rise from bed to start.
Another tussle, backwards hustle.
Never breakfast in this bustle.
Milk increases muscle.
But more importantly it's part of a free lunch.
Done packed a bunch of coupons so I can eat stuff.
3 fried nuggets, avoid the fish one.
French bread made it happen for me son.
Return home to empty cupboards, still never discovered.
How those roaches got up in that closed jar of peanut butter.
We got options, tuna fish a secondary dish.
TV Dinners are for.
winners.
Buried in the freezer is frozen pizza or chopped meat.
Might sleep, with hunger.
But never that cuz, we got, we got, we got, we got.

Pasta with Butter.
Prepared by my Mother.
Those Ronzoni sweet shells.
Know Mom's only meant well.
