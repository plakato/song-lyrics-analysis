Hipster Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


I feel like gun-buttin' these young bucks.
Them cock-buffers are cum buckets, numb nuts.
Quick to hop on the latest trend: White-on-white.
Then Black-on-black... all right, all right.
You sound retarded. A part of me wants to start sh*t.
Grab a carpet tool and carve Adam's apple out your oesophagus.
I'm just being honest. I wish it didn't phase me.
I wish these bandwagon riders ain't drive me crazy.
But the truth is, I'm a hipster-doofus.
And, whenever I see niggas biting, I get ruthless.
I quickly bring up the fact that I did the sh*t first.
Or that I brought the style back first.
And to make sh*t worse.
There's no way of knowing if what I'm saying is actually true.
It's just a gut-feeling I have that be having me blue.
Pissing my girl off, my family be mad at me, too.
Even those that're closest to me - ask Gravity, dude.
F*ck it, though. It's nothin', yo.
I know I'll never veer - two tears in a bucket, bro.
Always been a Knick-fan - put that on the bible.
Watch you hop up on that dick, fam, when we bag the title.
Bunch o' can't-beat-'em-join-'em-niggas.
Used-to-be-Laker-niggas.
Hopped up on the Heat-sack when they became major, nigga.
Then y'all caught the vapours quick when the Mavs scraped you, niggas.
Then you stood around. And, I'm supposed to believe you FAITHFUL, NIGGA?
Get the f*ck out, you little ninjas - deserve the middle finger.
Sh*t, I done followed the Nets since Kidd and Kittles, nigga.
I was up on the Mavs since Nash and Finley fast-breaks.
Be gone with your silly ass; you're mad late.
And that's regarding everything. You do nothing but follow.
And wallow in your tears when leaders* don't notice you swallow.
The problem with that is....

*there's another version of this track wherein he replaces 'leaders' with 'peers', possibly to incorporate a more accurate rhyme scheme.
