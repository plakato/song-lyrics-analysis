Miss Behave Lyrics
by YULTRON.


Drink beer, smoke weed, have sex, misbehave.
Drink beer, smoke weed, have sex, misbehave.
Drink beer, smoke weed, have sex, misbehave.
Misbehave, misbehave.
Drink beer, smoke weed, have sex, misbehave.
Drink beer, smoke weed, have sex, misbehave.
Drink beer, smoke weed, have sex, misbehave.
Misbehave, oh misbehave.

In the beginning, you was on my mind.
Saw you at the function, shawty way too fine.
'It ain't too complicated, Ima make you mine.
Sit you down there, baby take your time.

Oh misbehave, in the beginning she was such a square.
Says she was afraid of how I be a player.
But really ain't a player I just like to share.
And in the end you still let me kiss you there.

Oh misbehave, in the beginning she didn't drink at all didn't smoke at all.
Since we've been involved our neighbors hear our sex through the wall.
She wanna drink beer, wanna smoke weed.
If sex is a drug, I let her OD.

So let me take ya to the tele get it on with ya.
When I'm gone you want me on the phone with ya.
Sendin' nude pictures, damn what's wrong with ya?
Cause all the homies see it when I'm done with ya.

You was  actin' rude on the first date.
Now I see dat ass shake like a earthquake.
Bay-bay I beat it up like it's yo birthday.
Like Ray-J I record you lookin'.

Ha! From Monday to Thursday.
Drinkin' all night 23 on my jersey.
Uh, I eat the pussy like hersheys.
I use the tongue so you feelin' my wordplay.

x4.
Miss behave.
Miss behave.
Miss behave.
Miss behave.
