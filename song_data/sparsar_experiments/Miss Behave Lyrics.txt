Miss Behave Lyrics
by YULTRON.


Drink beer smoke weed, have sex, misbehave, 
Drink beer smoke, weed, have sex, misbehave, 
Drink beer smoke, weed, have sex, misbehave, 
Misbehave, misbehave, 
Drink beer smoke, weed, have sex, misbehave, 
Drink beer smoke, weed, have sex, misbehave, 
Drink beer smoke weed, have sex misbehave 
Misbehave, oh misbehave, 
 
In. The beginning, you was on my mind, 
Saw you at the function shawty way too fine, 
'It ain't too complicated Ima. Make you mine, 
Sit you down. There baby take your time, 
 
Oh misbehave. In the beginning, she was such a square 
Says. She was afraid of how I be a player. 
But, really ain't, a player I just like to share 
And. In the end, you still, let me kiss you there 
 
Oh misbehave. In the beginning, she didn't drink at all, didn't smoke at all. 
Since we've been involved. Our neighbors hear our sex through the wall. 
She wan na drink beer wan na smoke, weed 
If sex is a drug. I let her OD 
 
So. Let me take ya to the tele, get it on with ya 
When, I'm gone. You want me on the phone with ya 
Sendin' nude pictures, damn what's wrong with ya 
Cause, all the homies see it when I'm done with ya. 
 
You was actin' rude on the first date. 
Now. I see dat ass shake like a earthquake 
Bay-bay. I beat it up like it's yo birthday, 
Like Ray-J. I record you lookin' 
 
Ha From Monday to Thursday 
Drinkin' all night 23 on my jersey, 
Uh, I eat the pussy like hersheys 
I use the tongue, so you feelin', my wordplay 
 
, x4 
Miss behave. 
Miss behave, 
Miss behave, 
Miss, behave
