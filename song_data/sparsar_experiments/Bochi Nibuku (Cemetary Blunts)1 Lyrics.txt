Bochi Nibuku (Cemetary Blunts)1 Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Got a pack full of raps and a whole lot of dope to roll tonight.
Ima take your bitch to the back to the back of the lac and hold her tight.
All the windows down riding round your side of town.
Tray full of the blunt ash got a trunk stuffed with that fucking pounds.
Riding round riding round, Rain fall and its coming down.
Pinky ring go bling bling, but my switchblade don't make a sound.
I'm swerving, just serve it, these bitches call a good surgeon.
Your girl say she nervous, so she pop a pill and she twerking.
She bad, I'm good, find me swinging around my hood.
Rolling back woods back to back don't get it misunderstood,x2.

I'm rolling and smoking, and smoking and rollingx8.

I'm sitting in a chair rolling up some weed.
I don't give a fuck about what you need.
All I care about is me and me, and my W-E-E-D.
Come fuck with me, but don't fuck with me.
If you touch me I'll turn ugly.
If she ug-i-ly, then she hang with me.
Ima keep it real till I D-I-E.
I'm posted with the Bones, carcasses around my home.
Man I like to be alone, I'm to real to be a clone.
I ain't human, nigga, move on, before I remix your dome.
Airplane most stay on my phone, Bitch I won't ever answer my phone.

I'm rolling and smoking, and smoking and rollingx8.
Bitch.
