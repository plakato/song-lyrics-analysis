Saved Lyrics
by Ty Dolla $ign.


Ooh yeah.
Mustard on the beat, ho!
Errytime they see me ballin'.
All my old bitches callin'.
Pull up in exotic, I see a little bitch jockin'.

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Yeah!

Ty Dolla $ign.
No I won't save her.
Dolla $ign'll fuck but he won't date her.
About my paper, real big shit man.
everything Taylor.
Vans on like a skater.
We eatin' over here, man, everything catered.
She know I'm a player.
She wanna fuck now but I wanna fuck later.
She been lookin' for a baller.
Somebody that'll keep her in designer.
She ain't thinkin' 'bout love.
She got her mind on my money.
Can't get a damn thing from me.

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Yeah!

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane.
What's that nigga name? Captain-Save-A-Ho man.
He ain't me and I ain't him.
He a bozo, I'm a real one.
She take after her auntie, got.
her mind on my money.
Tattoo on her tummy, booty hella chunky.
Every time I see her, she look nicer and nicer.
Haters throw shade like a sun visor.
I told her that I'm broke, can't throw her half of my guap.
Bitch I ain't Rescue Ronnie, I ain't captain save a thot.
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, make me rich.
Follow my commands and I'll grant you a wish.
I'm just a real one from the gravel, from the soil, the mud.
And some of my thugs ain't never been to a club.
She ain't looking for love, she just wanna take a ride with the plug cause.
she....

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Yeah!

Errytime they see me ballin'.
All my old bitches callin'.
Pull up in exotic, I see a little bitch jockin'.

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her.
Yeah!
