Wake Up Show Anthem (1994) Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Oh-Oh-Oh, I'm coolin' with my niggas on the Wake up. Show-Oh-Oh 
We kick a little something for the radio-oh-oh 
 
Check it bust it 
Tune it up. It'S the corrupt novelist, Nas 
Involved in this liveness radio waves, 
Slaves thrive inside of this 
Wake Up, Show flow, hip-hop's alarm clock the bomb spot 
Mellow with ganja. That makes my eyes turn: yellow 
Seat reclined on my leather sofa, 
However close to Na-, be I'm Joe Quicks, 
King Tech. I could just see'em on the one and two son 
My blunted crew. Pour the rum 
92.3 number one in the slum 
Representin' DJ's 
Sway's. The host see police the most 
What, a collaboration, see I'm comatose 
No pork, just knowledge, and I'm born once more 
It's. The beat that blesses the street deep in the 9-4 
 
Hip-hops last prophet henceforth in excistence 
The 92.3 megahertz will exert radio waves, 
The slaves for a phenomenal distance. 
Electrons appear to slice through jeeps that you can hear some 
Slum that it will chunk. Consider it will numb your eardrum 
Kid, you sleepin', like a Latter Day, Saint 
With Sway.
