Good Times Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

I'm alive.
And that's all that I can ask for tonight.
Take a dive.
We're never gonna know unless we try.
All the stars are brighter suddenly.
And they're floating in a sea of possibility.
So tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna see.
I'm with you and that's where I wanna be.

The good times don't have to end.
We can hit the rewind and do it all over again.
The good times don't have to end.
We can hit the rewind and do it all over again.

Well, go ahead and hit that rewind button.
Then I'm gonna call a couple friends SWD and hippy hop.
What a blend gonna be an all-nighter if I attend.
Or I keep it real chill make you feel like you're swimming with dolphin.
Do it again, take a mulligan, like we're golfing.
I keep it so right on, so radical, far out, and crazy they all want to do it.
again.

The stars are brighter suddenly.
And they're floating in a sea of possibility.
So tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna see.
I'm with you and that's where I wanna be.

The good times don't have to end.
We can hit the rewind and do it all over again.
The good times don't have to end.
We can hit the rewind and do it all over again.
The good times don't have to end.
We can hit the rewind and do it all over again.
The good times don't have to end.
We can hit the rewind and do it all over again.

The good times don't have to end.
We can hit the rewind and do it all over again.
The good times don't have to end.
We can hit the rewind and do it all over again.

Again, again, again, again.
Lets do it all over again.
Again, again, again, again.
Lets do it all over again.
