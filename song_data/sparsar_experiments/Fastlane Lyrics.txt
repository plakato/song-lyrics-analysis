Fastlane Lyrics
by Syd tha Kyd.


Driving in my car , damn near cut me off , now you're in the fastlane , so.
you better not slow me down.
And i refuse to change my direction , so you best make up your mind before i.
get caught in the intersection.
And blinded by traffic lights.

Sending me mixed signals get right or get left , dont seem like you're ready.
so just get out my way , sending.
Me mixed signals get right or get left dont tell me you're sorry just get out.
my lane Slowin me down 5x.

Syd Tha Kyd.

Now we're moving faster , and you're catching up to speed and yes your car.
looks good to me an you know it.
Dont try to speed off like I didn't teach you all know are you ready for the.
open road?

Syd Tha Kyd.

Warning signs were there but we never cared so we crashed and learned a.
lesson and to take care of the.
Damage we need to admit that accidents happen , so if its cool with you i'll.
just be on my way.
