Twisting The Knife Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

I am the crawling and freezing bleeding blind behind you*.
Drowning the blame in a flood of hatefull lies.
Call it injustice but I'm the victim now murderer.
These years of confinement have forced up the rage.
WHY NOT TWIST THE KNIFE A LITTLE BIT MORE.
I don't expect you to know.
WHY NOT SPILL SOME POISON ON MY POUNDING HEART.
You don't really know my fears.
My fears always saved me from tearing apart.
Just one more night.
No, I won't tear down these walls and choke of my luck.
WHY NOT TWIST THE KNIFE A LITTLE BIT MORE.
I don't expect you to know.
WHY NOT SPILL SOME POISON ON MY POUNDING HEART.
You don't really know my fears.
I don't expect you to wonder.
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL DISGRACED.
My time is running out.
Hope is to fade away.
IT FADES AWAY.
WHY NOT TWIST THE KNIFE A LITTLE BIT MORE.
I don't expect you to know.
WHY NOT SPILL SOME POISON ON MY POUNDING HEART.
You don't really know my fears.
I don't expect you to wonder.
YOU WOULDN'T CARE IF I HATE YOU.
Nor if I loved you.
