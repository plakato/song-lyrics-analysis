The Terry Gantner Way Lyrics
by Sydney.

When you're forced to take a chance you turn around, you turn around.
And when you're backs against the fence then this my friend will be the sound.
Funny how you're struggling end is coming out, it's coming out.
So when you're forced to take a chance you my friend, you will go down.

Well it rings out and there's no reaction.
So just say what you want, and I'll swear that is happened.
Cause if anything, I'm everything you wanted me to always be.
We could make it.

Holding your breath, taking a chance.
Hoping for something good to come from this.
Because in the end, you're left with nothing but regret.

When you're forced to take a chance you turn around, you turn around.

Funny how your ugly trends are coming out, they're coming out.
So when you're forced to take a stand then this my friend will be the sound.

Well it rings out and there's no reaction.
So just say what you want, and I'll swear that is happened.
Cause if anything, I'm everything you wanted me to always be.
We could make it.

Holding your breath, taking a chance.
Hoping for something good to come from this.
Because in the end, you're left with nothing but regret.

And you think you're so smart, you're stuck in a moment so far from the start.
And you think you're so smart, you're stuck in a moment so far from the start.
So I'll go, so I'll go.
There are some things that I'll never know.
So I'll go, so I'll go.
There are some things that I'll never know.

Holding your breath, taking a chance.
Hoping for something good to come from this.
Because in the end, you're left with nothing but tears of regret.
Head in your hands, wishing that time could rewind.
Looking back won't move you forward now.
