Yellow Lyrics
by X.E.X.

NO , X.E.X.
No Matter What They Say.

Eat A Rose ...

I don't do drugs , I am drugs.

Baby just try me , You might like me.
Baby Just fuck me , You might love me.

I'm way too high, I'm too high.
I'm way too high , To figure out your lows.
So baby let go , And Let it Flow.
And if you're on these rainbows.
Baby I can take you Home.

Baby I'm a pro , I'll eat you whole.
I'll fuck you all night , baby you ain't sleep-in tonight.
I'll Prob make my mark , but baby guard your heart.
Cuz if you don't got a heart , then you got no heart.

I heard you like to play , I'd like to play.
Your hearts a maze, But I'm willing to play.
So call my name , Call my name.
Call my name , Call my name.

I'm entertained , oh baby ///.
Now you're my drug ...

Drug , drug , drug , drug.

YELLOW  2.

I haven't lost my appetite.
I still crave you every-night.
Just one bite , Just one night.
Else I'm going to die.

Its dinner time.
But i'm still dry.
Ya we used to work us overtime.
Whole nights, full-time.

No.

You the one to blame.
I consumed you like cocaine.
Baby you played your game.
Well baby well played.
I was your treat , your prey.
Well baby well played.
Hope you were entertained.
Well baby well played.

Its over.
Oh baby I know its over.
Just trying to stay sober.
I'm just trying to stay sober.

Baby its 10 degrees below.
Ya we used to shine as white as snow.
You know , you know.

Sorrow's now my daily flow.
Now I'm getting high and meeting low.
All day like a pro.

You the one to blame.
I consumed you in my vein.
Baby you played your game.
Well baby well played.
I was your meat , your prey.
Well baby well played.
Hope you were entertained.
Well baby well played.

Its over.
Oh baby I know its over.
Just trying to stay sober.
I'm just trying to stay sober.

Ya I need your cake.
I can't afford a break.
Come relieve this ache.
