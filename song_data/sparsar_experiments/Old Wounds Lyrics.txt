Old Wounds Lyrics
by Pup.

I caught your eye on the back of the bus. Like you, wanted
You wan na know why I don't come around anymore 
Well. It'S so fucking obvious
I can't stand you hanging round. Lately
I can't stand you trying to save me
It's, so fucking frustrating
I'm, bored of the games and bored of the chase
That's. The reason I left in the first place

You keep trying to rip open old wounds
It's. So embarrassing, don't you know, I'm over. You 

Now you wan na know where I've been lately
You wan na know. If I'm still a prick 
Well, I am and you're not gon na change. Me
So, you got another guy going with you
You, say you like him, but he's got a bad attitude
Well. Maybe he's perfect for you
And. Maybe he deserves less trouble than you gave him
Or. Maybe he deserves his face in the pavement

You, keep trying to rip open old wounds
It's. So embarrassing, don't you know I'm over you 

And, I'm trying to get it straight
Why the fuck! I came back in the first place

You know: I've never been good at anything
Except for fucking up and ruining everything
And, I'm sick of it. It'S so fucking frustrating
You keep trying to rip open old wounds. It'S so embarrassing
Don't! You know I'm over. You
