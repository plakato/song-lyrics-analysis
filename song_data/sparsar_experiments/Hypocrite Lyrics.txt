Hypocrite Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

What a hypocrite I am.

Taking liberties I see People dying all.
Around me Full of pride and evil greed.
I keep quiet in a world of need Casting.
Darkness on the earth Sin deceives me.
Like a curse The world is covered in.
Disease I sit back at ease.

What a hypocrite I am.

I'm sold as a slave to sin What a hideous state.
I keep giving in I do not understand what I do.
For what I hate to do I do The evil deep inside.
Of me Has seized its opportunity I can't do.
Right for doing wrong My time will soon be gone.
