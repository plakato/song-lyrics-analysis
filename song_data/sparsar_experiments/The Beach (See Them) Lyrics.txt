The Beach (See Them) Lyrics
by Xplicit Entertainment.


If you see them walking on the beach.
These girls look so fly.
I love to see them cuties on the beach.
Cause they look so fly.

I say the weather's looking sunny.
We're sipping on some Johnnie.
Heading to Maracas for this big beach party.
No time for feeling bummy.
We're about to spend some money.
Pulling out my phone, yeah we're about to link some honeys.
This girl from Arima.
She say she name was Tina.
She's pretty like Alica Keys and sexy like Trina.
This girl name Aruna.
She's from Tunapuna.
Have the prettiest smile, yeah I met her in La Luna.
This reds from Moruga.
She's sweet like a Fruta.
But I had to lock she off, cause she man was a shooter.
This darkie named Latoya.
A cutie little lawyer.
I swear I fell in love from the first time I saw her.
Girls from the west side.
Girls from the east side.
Tobago, central.
Girls from south side.
Pull up in their best rides.
Walking with their best strides.
About to start this party with this island beach vibe.

If you see them walking on the beach.
These girls look so fly.
I love to see them cuties on the beach.
Cause they look so fly.

Full up your cup with alcohol.
Let's have a ball.
So much girls, no time to waste at all.
Make it bounce for me baby in that sexy bikini.
Which one of you's gonna be my honey.

Hands in the air, lewwe have some fun.
Gonna party all day until the next morning.
All pretty girls just gather round.
Which one of you's gonna be my honey.

Yo.
I call up Keisha.
A little teaser.
Gonna make a beach run girl, where to meet you?
Got a killer body dan, call the reaper.
Ass so fat it could make a sinning preacher.
Turn around slow lemme see something.
Bikini thong's perfect for a beach bum.
Got the weed love, said she need some.
So I picked up mary for a threesome.
If it's one thing, I'm a stunting young king.
With enough bling to make a nigga jealous.
See the girl them, sing my anthem.
See my damn gems, and wanna leave their fellas.
See that ass? Ways.
As you run to the water for a dip.
With my spliff in my ash tray.
'Nuff girls ah get watch when they pass there.
It's the beach dawg, can't bring no sand there.

If you see them walking on the beach.
These girls look so fly.
I love to see them cuties on the beach.
Cause they look so fly.

Full up your cup with alcohol.
Let's have a ball.
So much girls, no time to waste at all.
Make it bounce for me baby in that sexy bikini.
Which one of you's gonna be my honey.

Hands in the air, lewwe have some fun.
Gonna party all day until the next morning.
All pretty girls just gather round.
Which one of you's gonna be my honey.
