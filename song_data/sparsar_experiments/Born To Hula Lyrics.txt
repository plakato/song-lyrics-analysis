Born To Hula Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


Follow trails of you to here.
Every mile takes you my way.
Rolling faster than we can.
Tables turning all the time.
I'm the dog at your feet.
So we are it again.

You're the one x4.

Fucking have to wait a dime.
Every single flinging mile.
They're coming faster all the while.

Ain't it something, we're born to hula x4.
