It's the rain Lyrics
by Two Fates.

Wake up in some place.
Sound of million hands.
Clapping for you, it's the rain.

Going back to sleep.
Trying to find your dream.
Curtains of tears.
Rounded like beads, it's the rain.

Mountains turning pink and grey.
Flattened angels' masquerade, and the rain.

Sun rose from the top.
And then lay on the floor.
He wants a ride on the carousel.
Now horses got burned.
So he had to bolt.
He starts to cry.
Will she come back? it's the rain.

Rollercoasters through the clouds.
Candy oceans and ice cream falls.

But he's still sad.
Then she tries back.
To make him laugh.
And see his light.
And he feels a pull to her.
He loves rain.

Wake up feeling odd.
Get dressed and go out.
Than you look above.
There's a rainbow on your way.
Now you understand.
He's born from sun's love for his rain.

All the rainbows getting closer.
On the way to candy ocean.
