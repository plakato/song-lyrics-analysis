Going Back Lyrics
by WordPlay T.JAY.


Let's put all the dark niggas in the back of the store.
Backwards we go, 400 years impacting the flow.
And while they all the moving backwards I happen to grow.
And they see my black face and then they act on the low.
Judging my integrity while I'm tryna gain prosperity.
And looking at my rarity and couldn't bark at my pedigree.
That malice there ain't fair to me.
How can you read a single person from their family tree.
They damaged me picture T.Jay when they see defeat.
Jumped every hurdle see a winner when you go to sleep.
These devils can't hold me back, these niggas can't say I'm wack.
These people don't know my craft, and this nigga don't owe you crap.
That statement there, right there's a fact.
Cause every year I never slack.
Remember that cause next year is coming.
I'm thinking 10 years down the road and that means I'm running.

They see where I'm going, going, going, going …
And I'm never going back, back, back, back… x2.

Let's put all the dark music at the back of the store.
Backwards we go, 400 years impacting the flow.
They look at hip hop like its black as a crow.
But won't blame another genre for the women they hoe.
Taylor Swift can sell her image make a fat girl woe.
And George Bush can sell a gun and make the building explode.
We just tell it how we see it let the story unfold.
And my cultures full of crap, yet politicians are gold?
These devils can't hold me back and these niggas can't say I'm wack.
These people don't know my craft, and this nigga don't owe you crap.
Our days are much worse than rap.
Don't blame us then not know the facts.
I'm here for those that need a helping hand.
Middle finger to the ones that never understand.
I'm just a man displaying all my weaknesses.
It's not my fault that you can't see where all the demons live.
