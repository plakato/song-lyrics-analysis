Stadium Lights Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

Well four years ago we wrote a story that you know.
We held down this town until you came around.
Well that was then and this is now and we're still gonna bring you down.

I never said that you had to agree.
Shoulda left as soon as you met me.
All alone one the phone.
Let's sneak out and go someplace new.
We can roll just like the stars do.
Fancy things with matching shades.
Skip the street side get an ocean view.
We're all getting laid!

I know what girls like you like.
Expensive things and fancy cars.
You know what boys like me like getting real far.

Ten bucks you'll listen to me, when I'm gone and you're on your own.
One second, let's get serious.
She'll never know.

I never said that you had to agree, but I bagged you much to easily.
Now we're alone, no one's home.
I saved my bad intentions just for you.
We can roll just like those stars do.
Cheap drinks up way too late.
Drop the town life for a city view.
We don't play it safe.

I know what girls like you like.
Expensive things and fancy cars.
You know that boys like me like going real far.

Ten bucks you'll listen to me, when I'm gone and you're on your own.
One second, let's get serious.
She'll never know.

DON'T PUSH ME CAUSE I'm CLOSE TO THE EDGE, I'm TRYING NOT TO LOSE MY HEAD.
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge, I'm trying not to lose my head.

Ten bucks you'll listen to me, when I'm gone and you're on your own.
One second, let's get serious.
She'll never know.
She'll never know.
She'll never know.
