Magic love Lyrics
by Unlimited.

Oh ! that last kiss.
Oh ! how i love to rem-anise.
On how that kiss felt .. just like the first time.
Oh how quickly i got butterflies.
Oh ! Got dammit i miss staring into your big brown eyes.
Any time spent away from you , breaks my heart in two.

I never fell so easily.
Guess you got that affect on me.
Its makes me want to scream.
OH,OH OH OH OH OH.
,OH,OH OH OH OH OH.
AND OH , OH OH OH OH OH.
Its like you got me under your spell.
Oh I don't care baby what the hell.
OH,OH OH OH OH OH.
,OH,OH OH OH OH OH.
AND OH , OH OH OH OH OH.

I hope your not playing games.
I pray to god you feel the same.
Baby i hope you understand.
Im not interested in no other man.
You got me tied , I ain't gonna lie.

I never fell so easily.
Guess you got that affect on me.
Its makes me want to scream.
OH,OH OH OH OH OH.
,OH,OH OH OH OH OH.
AND OH , OH OH OH OH OH.
Its like you got me under your spell.
Oh I don't care baby what the hell.
OH,OH OH OH OH OH.
,OH,OH OH OH OH OH.
AND OH , OH OH OH OH OH.
