Troopers Reprezent Lyrics
by 3rd Eye.

Yes indeed.
94 is the season.

3rd Eye.
Well, once upon a time, remember when.
Ya had a slop down, couldn't hear the sound.
Of the E-y-e ringin in the new year.
Who shall I fear?
Comin for the dungeon, grudge not what you can't see.
They could not decipher the text book I daily.

Zone 7.
...the mind tricks, I try to get a grip.
Slip into a different schizophrenic skit.
Chaotic, and the flow is hypnotic.
Erotic, demonic, sonic, atomic, chronically demolished artist.
The shit I spark on brothers heartless.
Gaspin, askin, who's the one to put your style in traction.
All that, the ditch digger, that's him.

Nine.
I'm on some next shit, can I wreck shit?
With my Sumo-fat style cause yours is anorexic.
Chck-chck-pow, boom-boom-bap-bang.
Ten feet of rope around your neck and can't hang.
I'm runnin rings around rappers like a dirty collar.
I don't care if you whisper or if ya holler.
True, 9 Double M will do you like voodoo.
You butterknife in the house of ginzu.
16 eyes on your face and can't see me.
Since a cloud of smoke like _I Dream of Jeannie_.
You in a $100 spot with a buck.
Like the gods and 3rd Eye say, kid: eeease up!

3rd Eye.
Next up, time for me to fly, come on.
Back up, back up, turn the track up.
Black, I'm 'bout to blow up - boom.
Best to give me room, I'm comin through.
You can't do me.
Yo, who you be?
Even Aaron Hall couldn't 'groooove me'.
Boy, your little style don't move me.
Truly, you never knew me, you're booty.
My 3rd Eye style is heavy duty.
My crew be gettin funky like a spliff of the skunky.
You can't even get a whiff of the funk, punk.
Tried to get the formula, but I be two levels on top of them.
Proper, ain't no stoppin him when I'm droppin em.
Chopper, I chop em in them bread crumbs and get they head numb.
Fuck around, I be like REDRUM! REDRUM!

Now all my troopers in the front represent.
And all my troopers in the back represent.
And all my troopers on the left represent.
Hey yo, my troopers on the right represent.
Now all my troopers in the back represent.
And all my troopers up front represent.

Top Quality.
I leave no questions about who flip-whips the mic.
It's the pen blockrocker, no doubt to get you hype.
With the slide, slide shit to make you flip.
Got the skills to write my scripts.
So yo, let me kick it one time, peep the technique.
Don't sleep, it creeps right up on ya.
Wanna battle, who's gonna rescue you?
It's time to show you somethin that you never knew.
????? cause I'm comin through.

Zone 7.
Now it's hectic, check it yo, don't stress that yet.
Where I'm steaming from holding my bones, see me come to wreck it.
Rolling it with my brother stompin skulls.
What you tryin?
Crazy muthafuckas dyin.
Some get broken, some still smokin.
Strictly ????? runnin through the streets.
If you sleep you're stupid, I'm back in lovely.
Cops don't try to stop me, back up off me, not sellin drugs, gee.
And I'm smashin MC's.
Collectin g's, air get salty.
Money, you was faulty.
I protect quickly, don't get with me.
Then I'm Audi, back down south, gee.
Crazy rowdy.

Lord Finesse.
Check it.
It's the automatic Asiatic rap fanatic.
I'm like a addict that gots to have it.
When I see the microphone I ain't scared to grab it.
Fuck that, it's Lord Finesse, now there you have it.
It's the grand speaker, smoke you like reefer.
Fuck it, I put it on like sneakers.
Here to stay and get paid in the right way.
Shit I say is x-rated like Andrew Dice Clay.
A showstopper, I'm a rocker who can flow proper.
Girls clock me like a muthafuckin soap opera.
Brothers be makin rhymes, talk about takin mine.
Kids need to chill and resign, don't waste your time.
Cause you brothers are blind, y'all don't know.
I got plenty rhymes, I bust your monkey ass anytime.

3rd Eye.
Well, it's time to manifest this manifestation.
Of a ill skill will, free will abil'.
Still doin 10 more years on a bid.
For the verbal assaults on these kids out.
They think they dope, set up on a Troo Kula scale.
Weighed less than a gram, was a flam for my sale.
Yeah, cause I can flip that ???
Never knew a lyric who flew.
Troo the trendsetter, flex to get better.
Decipher your code to the very last letter.
I can't sink with this instinct to think.
My thought caught abroad, your skull to the brink.
With a wink, I re-define the dense contents.
Of nonsense, flip that to intelligence.
You want it hemmed up, stitched up, sewn up.
Aw shit, kid, you don't know a fuck.

Bronx represent.
Queens represent.
Brooklyn represent.
Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy represent.
Represent, represent.
Represent, represent.
Staten Island.
Represent, represent.
Represent, represent.
Long Island represent, represent.
Represent, represent.
Boogie Down Bronx representin y'all for 1994.

Uknowmsayin?
Remember that.
We out.
