Beat It Lyrics
by Quavo.


I pour an 8 in a liter.
We trending the world like PETA.
I'm an OG like Adidas.
Two seater, two seater, two seater.
I got an iPhone and beeper.
Look at your ho, she a cheater.
And you still want to keep her.
I just Michael Jackson beat her.

Don't talk about swag, I'm dabbing.
I read up on all new assassins.
I'm moving in orderly fashion.
We gotta move like Obama, Obama, Obama.
My niggas playing with plastic.
My life a real scare tactic.
You niggas drinkin' molasses.
What is you drinking? Why did you buy that and drink it?
When I first got my pound I broke it down.
Dancing with the work like I'm James Brown.
Young nigga having fame ‘round town.
Then we got rich off of verbs and nouns.
Never been a sucker, never been a clown.
Cash out a four four check, then watch it bounce.
Trap out the bando, trap out the ounce.
Finesse the plug ‘cause he keeps changing amounts.
30 in my hand, pump on the couch.
Cause a nigga paranoid now.
If you come up don't abandon your hood.
They'll be the first to punch you right out.
My life is looking amazing.
If I send you rice, it come with the gravy.
Think a nigga talking crazy.
Try it ‘fore you buy it, I make you pay me.

I pour an 8 in a liter.
We trending the world like PETA.
I'm an OG like Adidas.
Two seater, two seater, two seater.
I got an iPhone and beeper.
Look at your ho, she a cheater.
And you still want to keep her.
I just Michael Jackson beat her.

I hurt suckers' feelings, I don't need you.
Zoovie Zoo love Rem by the liter.
It's getting cold and I love juuging season.
20 thou' get you murked for no reason.
Ay, Zoo Gang corner bending.
This two seater sound different.
I drop the top, no ceilings.
I'm skirting on ‘em when I serve ‘em.
Collect mine, hit the birds then.
Fore I ran for the workin'.
I trap hard, that's my worry.
I put that on my Irving.
800 thousand on my brand new Benz.
Ask Zoo Gang, we don't leave loose ends.
80 Zoo City, at the corner, and I ?
And Quavo and ZooWap make your bitch jump in.

I pour an 8 in a liter.
We trending the world like PETA.
I'm an OG like Adidas.
Two seater, two seater, two seater.
I got an iPhone and beeper.
Look at your ho, she a cheater.
And you still want to keep her.
I just Michael Jackson beat her.
