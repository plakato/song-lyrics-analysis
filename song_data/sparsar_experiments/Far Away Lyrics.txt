Far Away Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

Don't you ever get together.
When you're far away, when you're far away?
The nights are long, well, it's something that you never seen.
But it's hard to say, but it's hard to say.
Don't listen to the words they say.
They can take it or leave it anyway.
Just let it go another day.
Step down from the mountainside.
Well, I see that you're doing fine.
When you're far away, when you're far away.
Well, you tell me that you're coming down.
Well, it's good to see that you're back around.
But it's hard to say, I was far away.
Don't listen to the words they say.
They could never believe you anyway.
Just let it go another day.
I believe that love is gonna last forever.
And it's all within my mind, and it's all within my mind.
I believe that love is gonna last forever.
And it's all within my mind, and it's all within my mind.
I believe that love is gonna last forever.
And it's all within my mind, and it's all within my mind.
I believe that love is gonna last forever.
And it's all within my mind, and it's all within my mind.
Can you believe that love is gonna last forever?
And it's all within my mind, and it's all within my mind.
