Me and the Boyz Lyrics
by Visual.


Coolin out at the crib or going out for a cruise.
Spitting out raps like we got nothin to lose.
Me &amp; my boys we're Mexi-Cuba-Rican.
Asian,Black,White got haters tweakin.
Entrepreneurs, film makers,MC's ....
DJ's, producers, dudes you can't be ....
&amp; cuz we speak .. we're people you all need.
What we all bring, makes your world complete.
We don't play ya'll, we stand &amp; stay tall.
People are trippin, we're Superman with the cape off.
We walk around the city checking demons &amp; kiddies.
Been down since we used to spread honey on Phillies.
Now we smoke kush, pack pipes &amp; tweak.
@ the bar mad liquor with a little iced tea.
When we hang, we drink , talk jazz &amp; build.
This is for you &amp; ya boys , a little something to feel.

Summer nights cruising ... Me and the boyz.
Wylin out, being stupid .... Me and the boyz.
Po it up, roll it up ... Me and the boyz.
Live it up, live it up ... Me and the boyz.
We don't really give a ... , Naw not ... Me and the boyz.
&amp; we don't trust, all we got is us ... Me and the boyz.
&amp; its a must that we live it up ... Me and the boyz.
Live it up, live it up ... Yup, Me and the boyz.

&amp; if you negative, you get the negative.
We keep it positive , to get the positive.
We too young die, we work hard to live.
Some of us are fly &amp; some of us the shit.
We just brainiacs, thought maniacs.
When we speak they like please keep saying that.
We on that Madden, we on that 2k.
We on them airplanes, with a suit case.
We globe-trotters ya'll , we fake spotters ya'll.
Yeah we see you ... but don't bother ya'll.
We too busy with the plans &amp; the action.
To see clowns &amp; do more than start laughing.
We got our eyes on the sky, eyes on the prize.
&amp; don't be a surprised if you see us so alive.
Cuz we wylin, out man livin our life.
Cuz we wylin, out man livin our life.
