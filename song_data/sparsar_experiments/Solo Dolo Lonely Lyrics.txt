Solo Dolo Lonely Lyrics
by Woop.


I've been getting it, I've been getting it on my own.
When I do business I do business on my own.
Ain't no room for no fake friends, I'm on my own.
Cause you got to watch your back when your alone.
It's so lonely.

Lately I've been slidin'.

I know they see, they watching me, they hiring me.
I kill them fools without a word in silency.
I know the real, I peep the phony, I smell the fake.
I recognize, I know this dude, no hater trace.
?
They say life's a bitch, bitches like to fuck.

middle man.
Running with the bands like a gingerbread.
Real dirty dirty how you got the ?
So watch out for them fake bands.
And watch out for them low tops.

Cause I will never cross eye like 20/20 vision.
I'm gone.

Me, my swisher ?
I'm a motion picture, Kodak.
Me is who I ride for.
And the main reason I smoke ?
I confess, me is who I lied for.
And I'll lie again if it come to me, now company and good company.
I tell my friends purp be better than weed.
Fight until the end, I ain't scared of the feds.
Even watch you kin kill on your family tree.
And your whole family'll kill you behind jealousy.
It's real.
