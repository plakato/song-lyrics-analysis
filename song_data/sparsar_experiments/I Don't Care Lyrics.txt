I Don't Care Lyrics
by Swifty McVay.


From the cradle to the grave.
This nigga wasn't raised to be a slave.
An entrepreneur stuck in his ways.
I don't care about your actions.
Whether you sniffin 'caine.
Or even if you gave an AK to Ronald Reagan.
I don't care if you was praising the 80's.
You ain't shit to me.
Funkadelic history or hippies in the 60's.
Or an elderly patient, a war-war conversation.
I ain't protecting this forsaken nation.
They still got me on papers, contract or probation.
For every dollar I make, it's four haters.
That can't wait to make her come up.
They watch a nigga and wishing I was lazy.
But sleeping just ain't me.
And being ocaleptic doesn't pay me.
Unless a nigga selling records on the internet.
Lately, I been underestimated greatly.
You never put fear in me, to break me is a damn conspiracy.
And lately, I getting the cipher's if I want to.
But nah, they see me in the circle, I'm stomping.
Whoever think to test me like professors.
I'm giving this asswhooping.
So you can catch this motherfucking lesson.
I don't care about nothing black.
But Dirty Dozen comrade.
And player haters be wishing that I caught a cap.
Or in the cadillac, with brains in my lap.
But they will never come where I'm at.
I don't care nigga.

People stop and stare.
Like I am something rare.
Well those silly looks you can spare.
Cuz I don't care.
I will not fight to fare.
I do so solemly swear.
If that's something you can't bear.
Well I don't care.

See I celebrate alone.
I never let people inside my home.
Cuz I don't keep my same phone number on.
I change it every other week.
And I'm my own agent.
I speak for myself, got no patience.
Get irritated mo, and major polticians.
That don't get no where, and I will never sell my soul.
To any individual, no matter how large the residual.
You try to give, my salvation's critical.
For shit I did years ago, my nerves are working.
My old peers are gone, cuz they served their purpose.
In my life, and two wrongs will never make it right.
We ain't perfect but I won't make the same mistakes twice.
And the dice you was rolling, it wasn't always 7 or 11.
And crap sometime, they kept me going.
I will never let it a no win situation haunt me.
Even if you were snitching me like faggot ass Choncey.

See this hip hop needs a nigga.
But I don't need the haters.
Rap is like food, eating is second nature.
My notebooks the plate, my lyrics are the faucet.
And fuck whoever having thoughts of eating off it.
I earned my bread, I baked it in an instant.
So what if you pissed nigga? Wash your own dishes.
You can't rub a bottle and there ain't no three wishes.
The only Genie is in the sky, and he's pissed.
All our fuck ups and fighting, and mobbing every night and.
You can run from slugs, but we can't dodge the lighting.
I don't get excited, I know how Life is.
Ain't gotta be the five-o, to raise you and indicte shit.
Call yourself a grown man, really though? Silly ho!
But on your nightstand you keep a box of KIX cereal.
I couldn't be a hero, my screws are let loose.
The government would never give a fuck on who I rescue.
I don't care.
