All I Have is A Song Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

And that's a song.
A piece of me to live on.
Cause all I have is a song.
I'll be standing at your door following along.



So I play this song one more time, cause Lord its all I know.
Oh you know I ain't complaining.
All I have is a song.
Cause I can tell, Lord its just your plan.
But I just can't let it go.
And all the meories we've shared.
All I have is a song.
I keep thinking about the friends I've had.
Lord its all I know.

They keep coming back, time and time again.
These ol' white lines on the highway.
Seems like I've been out all my life.


And this song will live on.
So I thank you for what I have.
Sometimes I wonder was it worth the cost.
And all I've lost.
