Good News On The Remix (Interlude) Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.

SAM.
Dude. I got to hear it! I wanna fucking hear it! I can't even like, I can't.
even process what is going on right now, so, I like, like, need a moment. Hold.
on, I'm losing it.

REMIXER.
I got two phones, I'm trying to record you crying.

SAM.
I can't - I'm not crying, dude!

REMIXER.
I'm recording you crying, man!

SAM.
Fuck! You gotta send it to me, though! Can you please send it to me?

REMIXER.
I don't know what you're talking about.

SAM.
God damn it. Oh my God.

REMIXER.
Alright, man.

SAM.
Noooo! Fucking shit, dude, this is so crazy!
Alright. I'll figure - OK. I'll tell the guys to get on it.

REMIXER.
OK, cool.

SAM.
Peace, man.
