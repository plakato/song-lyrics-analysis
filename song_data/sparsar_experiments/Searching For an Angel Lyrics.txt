Searching For an Angel Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Yeah, tried to get into my idealistic side.
Pain you know, still searching you know.
I'm feeling the vibe, you know.
I guess I'm like, every other person.
Searching for that woman, that you ever saw again.
But rarely attain, I think I found her though.

, but ain't no angels on Earth.
So I'ma ride this thang out, and play the game for what it's worth.
, there ain't no angels on Earth.
Why bother to search, when hope to finds a gift and a curse.
, I know you ain't far away.
If you I could just talk to you, so many things I'd say.
, you were my first girlfriend.
Still got that crazy crush on you, don't want this thang to end.

Yung Ro.
I had a crush on you since eight, I always liked you.
But I never knew the right words to speak to, or write you.
You had me rocking a flat top, to impress you boo.
Kriss-Kross flip my pants backwards, made you think I was cool.
When I was eleven, I grew courage, to step and hug you.
But grown men and even lil' kids, all loved you.
Mama told me not to kiss you, but she ain't want me to rap.
And the only thing that I loved, it wasn't loving me back.
It wasn't a thing I couldn't tell you, or confess to you.
And I'd destroy any nigga, trying to get to next to you.
I was jealous watching you, giving it all I had.
Even though that piece of paper and a dream, was all I had.
One day you gave me a chance, and let a nobody speak.
In return you made every man that I met, respect me.
You got a perfect memory, my words stuck in your head.

You make me feel better bout myself, I didn't want you to stop it.
You took me when I was depressed, without a dime in my pocket.
Then you gave me a profit, and switched up the scenery.
Now people wanna work with me, and they not being mean to me.
But it's not what it seem to be, cause Keisha and Trina be.
All in my face for greenery, I just wanted her sing for me.
Now we done came this far, I never wanted to hurt you.
But me and you together, done created a bad circle.
You know the fast life, your chance for riches and spending.
Groupies would change your whole perspective, judging bitches and women.
A sudden glitch in the system, oh how I miss the beginning.
Switching to sinning, I pray to only get to the ending.
I guess the game got me cold hearted, avenging with fly aggression.
With a shield scared to trust, money power for my protection.
Got a passion for purpose, so now I'm stressing I'm tired.
Tell Mack I'm resting I'm tired, with my success steady rising.
I gotta meet with so and so, pack up hit the road and go.
And people wanna know the difference, between Yung Ro and Beau.
How his first acting role, he just came so real.
Easy Beau had cut, Ro felt that pain for real.
, I looked at music like a bitch.
Cause she with a lot of rappers, cause they say that they rich.
, to tell you the truth.
Music I wrote in this song, just to say fuck you.
, I looked at music like a bitch.
Cause she with a lot of rappers, cause they say that they rich.
, and the ones that told the truth.
She denied em so music, fuck you g'eah.

You know everybody, need somebody you know.
Sometimes you lie, when you feel you got nobody.
G'eah, huh nobody g'eah.
