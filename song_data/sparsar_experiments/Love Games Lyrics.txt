Love Games Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

You called me up and said, ?I?ll see you tonight.
I?ll pick you up at a quarter to 9?
But now it?s 10, looks like you've done it again.
Was it a friend? What?s your excuse this time?

It?s your love games.

That?s what?s breakin? us in two.
And it?s your love games.

Can?t you see the things you do?

It?s your love games.

Let?s try to start anew.
And stop your love games, love games.
It?s your love games, it?s your love games.

You call me back to say, ?I?m sorry, I?m late?

Apologize and said you helped a friend.
But was your friend a her or a him.
Tell me when will this madness end.

It?s your love games.

That?s what?s breakin? us in two.
And it?s your love games.

Can?t you see the things you do?

It?s your love games.

Let?s try to start anew.
And stop your love games, love games.
It?s your love games, it?s your love games.

You want your cake and eat it too.
But I was told ?bout guys like you.
I guess some things will never change.
Just different players and different games.

So, this is what you think love?s all about.
Games, when are you gonna grow up.
If you wanna play games.
Why don?t you go ask your daddy for a quarter.

It?s your love games.

It?s your love games.

It?s your love games, it?s your love games.

It?s your love games.

That?s what?s breakin? us in two.
It?s your love games.

Can?t you see the things you do?

It?s your love games.

Let?s try to start anew.
And stop your love games, love games.
