He Hit Me Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


Our engineer's lazier than a muh-f*cka.
Quick to take money, but slow to conduct a.
Studio session for less than $50 per.
And that money thurr' wasn't worth the sh*t we'd heard.
What we'd heard when we got the last track back.
Plus, it's worse that we got a slow turn-around.
Cause we'd write to new beats on the fast track, black.
And, when we got it back, we'd been spread the word around.
The beat had become old news and so did the buzz.
So, we looked for a producer who we could trust.
Found a nigga named Dub-Z with lovely beats out the ass.
Plus, the first session was free.
So, I went back to my producer/engineer.
And told him I could never get used to his slow service.
I needed someone quick-actin'.
I tried to tell him more, but that's when....

He hit me, and it felt like a kiss.
He hit me, but it didn't hurt me.
He couldn't stand to hear me say.
That I'd been with someone new.

He hit me, and it felt like a kiss.
He hit me, and I was glad.

Now, you know I had to yap the nigga back, right?
Lay the boy out and snatch the nigga's jack, right?
He's lucky I didn't crack him with the bat.
In a way my gully uncle would've acted in his past life.
A swing here and a swing there.
Swinging like a monkey in the jungle... Upton Sinclair.
Lucky I didn't bear arms up in there.

Yes, he hit me, and it felt like a kiss.
He hit me, and it felt like a kiss.
He hit me, and it felt like a kiss.
And, when he hit me, he made me laugh.
