Down With It Lyrics
by Virtue.


I spread the gospel of God cuz I got to and those who don't like it can laugh.
if they want to. I know by the end of the day every knee must bow every tongue.
proclaim Christ.
Lord of Lord's King of Kings yes Jesus.
Raised the bar set a standard for us.
To live by oh you best believe I live for him ride for him cuz he's done for.
me.

B-sec.
unconditionally show me.

Meet your every last need now who.

All you can't on your own always.

Like him so tell me.

Everlasting life, are you down wit it.
Living for Christ, are you down wit it?
Havin' worldly riches and fame.
Got nothing on being saved.
Everlasting live, are you down wit it.
Living for Christ are you down with it.
Oh yeah.
Can you touch and agree with me that you're born again and set free.

In this crazy world today we need an anchor.
So that we don't get swept away casue when it's over.
I refuse to be left behind.
Blind sighted by the world yes that is why I.
Pay no attention to the words that are said to me.
All I do is keep my focus on who bled for me.
Gave his life so I'd have my own.
Paid off a debt in full that he never owed.

B-sec.

All those who ain't afraid to say.
I chose to live the righteous way.
Let me hear ya say yeah I'm down.
Let me hear ya say yeah I'm down.
All those who can relate to me.
And know that he's set you free.
Let me hear ya say yeah I'm down.
Let me hear ya say ya right now.
