It's Nothin' - feat. Donell Lewis Lyrics
by Ty.

Stereo phone: Let's go 
 
I call the lady Ms. Thorogood 
Cause she bad to the bone. 
We, don't fuck around here girl, 
Sip this bottle and it's on 
I told her baby. It'S nothin' 
And! We both arrive like it's nothin' 
She thought it's over. It'S nothin' 
And! We do it again, like it's nothin' 
I'm, a beat it up, 
 
Mike Jack. I beat it. 
Marco said good, look! 
I, don't really need it. 
Rub me the right way. 
I could be your genie 
If. The bitch got an attitude I get it delete it. 
Heeeeeeeey 
It's payday take that bitch home 
Shoot, a Kim and Ray J 
Sipping on that blue duck. 
Bone, crazy 
Baby going down 
I be screaming mayday 
Beat drop Pay, the price Pete rock 
She know I'm from the dirty, but I'm spitting, detox, 
I'm, handsome, tough and tatted up 

I call the lady Ms. Thorogood 
Cause she bad to the bone. 
We don't fuck around here! Girl 
Sip this bottle and it's on 
I told her baby. It'S nothin' 
And. We both arrive like it's nothin' 
She thought it's over. It'S nothin' 
And. We do it again, like it's nothin' 
I'm, a beat it up. 
 
Uh Hammer time. Have you seen her 
Ass, so fat lady, looking like Eva 
Roll up with the team 
I'm a have to C.G her 
Baby is an atheist 
I'll make her a believer. 
I heard she make clips wit, her friends, 
Well girl, I'm a spider, throw it on the web. 
Shit, don't change when we fly O'seas 
That's that yellow brick road NZ to O'Z, aye, 
Beat drop 
I, don't really beat box 
But in the bedroom baby, I'm a beat box, get it 
Young kings. It'S a wrap bro 
Mr. Lewis, tell'em what it stand for: 
TY,

I call the lady Ms. Thorogood 
Cause she bad to the bone. 
We, don't fuck around here girl, 
Sip this bottle and it's on 
I told her baby. It'S nothin' 
And! We both arrive like it's nothin' 
She thought it's over. It'S nothin' 
And. We do it again like it's nothin' 
I'm, a beat it ..., 
 
Get down, beat it up. Go south 
All, the homies in the club screaming man down 
And. You know it's about to go down 
Used to be a good girl. She, a good girl, 
Gone bad now, 
Shorty from the south 
That's over the ditch. 

Let me show you what it is: girl roll with the click 
And. When we take it to the crib, you can swallow the D 
I'm playin', I'm playin', listen baby, let the good times roll all day, 
You're messing with the homie from the east coast bay. 
Go play my shit again. Mayn, you already know: oh 
I, don't save hoes ..., 
 
I call the lady Ms. Thorogood 
Cause she bad to the bone. 
We, don't fuck around here girl, 
Sip this bottle and it's on 
I told her baby. It'S nothin' 
And! We both arrive like it's nothin' 
She thought it's over. It'S nothin' 
And. We do it again, like it's nothin' 
I'm, a beat it up: 
 
Let's go
