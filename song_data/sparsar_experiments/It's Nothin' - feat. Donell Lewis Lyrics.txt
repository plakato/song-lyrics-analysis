It's Nothin' - feat. Donell Lewis Lyrics
by Ty.

Stereo phone, Let's go.

I call the lady Ms. Thorogood.
Cause she bad to the bone.
We don't fuck around here girl.
Sip this bottle and it's on.
I told her baby, it's nothin'.
And we both arrive like, it's nothin'.
She thought it's over, it's nothin'.
And we do it again like, it's nothin'.
I'm a beat it up.

Mike Jack I beat it.
Marco said good look.
I don't really need it.
Rub me the right way.
I could be your genie.
If the bitch got an attitude, I get it, delete it.
Heeeeeeeey.
It's payday, take that bitch home.
Shoot a Kim and Ray J.
Sipping on that blue duck.
Bone, crazy.
Baby going down.
I be screaming mayday.
Beat drop, Pay the price, Pete rock.
She know I'm from the dirty but I'm spitting detox.
I'm handsome, tough and tatted up.

I call the lady Ms. Thorogood.
Cause she bad to the bone.
We don't fuck around here girl.
Sip this bottle and it's on.
I told her baby, it's nothin'.
And we both arrive like, it's nothin'.
She thought it's over, it's nothin'.
And we do it again like, it's nothin'.
I'm a beat it up.

Uh, Hammer time, have you seen her?
Ass so fat, lady looking like Eva.
Roll up with the team.
I'm a have to C.G her.
Baby is an atheist.
I'll make her a believer.
I heard she make clips wit her friends.
Well girl I'm a spider, throw it on the web.
Shit don't change when we fly O'seas.
That's that yellow brick road NZ to O'Z, aye.
Beat drop.
I don't really beat box.
But in the bedroom baby I'm a beat box, get it.
Young kings it's a wrap bro.
Mr. Lewis tell 'em what it stand for.
TY.

I call the lady Ms. Thorogood.
Cause she bad to the bone.
We don't fuck around here girl.
Sip this bottle and it's on.
I told her baby, it's nothin'.
And we both arrive like, it's nothin'.
She thought it's over, it's nothin'.
And we do it again like, it's nothin'.
I'm a beat it....

Get down, beat it up go south.
All the homies in the club screaming man down.
And you know it's about to go down.
Used to be a good girl, she a good girl.
Gone bad now.
Shorty from the south.
That's over the ditch.

Let me show you what it is girl, roll with the click.
And when we take it to the crib you can swallow the D.
I'm playin' I'm playin' listen baby let the good times roll all day.
You're messing with the homie from the east coast bay.
Go play my shit again mayn you already know, oh.
I don't save hoes....

I call the lady Ms. Thorogood.
Cause she bad to the bone.
We don't fuck around here girl.
Sip this bottle and it's on.
I told her baby, it's nothin'.
And we both arrive like, it's nothin'.
She thought it's over, it's nothin'.
And we do it again like, it's nothin'.
I'm a beat it up.

Let's go.
