Branded Lyrics
by The Word Alive.


No living savior to follow home.
Wandering hopeless into the unknown.
Is there hope, to hope like them?
Save me from the hell I'm in.

We came dependent just to be branded.
It's hard to believe we don't belong.
Here we are standing, together demanding.
Singing for those who don't belong.

So here we are.
Off in the unknown.
Aimless, but tired of being alone.
Is there hope? To hope like them?
Save me from the hell I'm in.

We came dependent just to be branded.
It's hard to believe we don't belong.
Here we are standing, together demanding.
Singing for those who don't belong.

Lost and found, I had no home.
Found myself when I gave up hope.
So don't forget your darkest hours.
Light the way to a life empowered.
Don't forget your darkest hours.
Light the way, light the way.

We came dependent just to be branded.
It's hard to believe we don't belong.
Here we are standing, together demanding.
Singing for those who don't belong.
Don't belong.
