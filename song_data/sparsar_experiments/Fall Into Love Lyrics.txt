Fall Into Love Lyrics
by Wrathschild.


I never hear love songs on the radio, no more.
Is it cause we're too scared to fall?
Or is it cause we're too cool?

Don't be so crass, I got something to say.
Get off your bad ass, let's do this the right way.
Sex will forever be on our minds.
But I want the real thing, just like an 80's movie.

Let's fall into lo-ove, tonight.
Come and scoop me up in your ride.
It'll be like in the movies.
With your bass pumping in the night.

Let's fall into lo-ove tonight.

I wanna feel the magic of the afterglow again.
Cause my morning breath and your walk of shame.
Don't get my heart racin'.

So gimme a dozen roses or somethin'.
Let's go back to prom days and do this the right way.
Sex will forever be on our minds.
But I want the real thing, just like an 80's movie.

Ohhh ayeeeahh, ayeeeahh.
Ohhh ayeeeahh, ayeeeahh.
Avalat nalafa nawah, avalat nalafa nawah.
Avalat nalafa nawah, avalat nalafa nawah.
Ohhh ayeeeahh, ayeeeahh.

It'll be like in the movies.
With your bass pumping in the night.
