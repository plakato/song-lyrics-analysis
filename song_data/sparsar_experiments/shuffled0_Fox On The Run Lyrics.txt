Fox On The Run Lyrics
by Ace Frehley.


Fox on the run.
I don't wanna know your name.

You scream and everybody comes a-running.

Okay, you think you got a pretty face.


I don't wanna know your name.
You, you talk about just every band.
Cause you don't look the same.
I've heard it all before.
But the names you drop are second hand.
F-foxy, fox on the run and hideaway.
Fox on the run.
Foxy on the run.
Fox on the run.
Fox on the run.
You looked all right before.
Cause you don't look the same.
But the rest of you is out of place.
Fox on the run.

You scream and everybody comes.
Take a run and hide yourself away.
You scream and everybody comes a-running.
Fox on the run.
Foxy on the run.
Take a run and hide yourself away.
F-foxy, fox on the run and hideaway.
The way you did before.
A-running, take a run and hide yourself away....

Foxy on the run.
The way you did before.

Fox on the run.
Fox on the run.
Fox on the run.
