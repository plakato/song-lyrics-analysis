14th Street Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

You'Ve got my lost brother's soul
My, dear mother's eyes
A brown, horse's mane
And, my uncle's name
You walked me down 14th Street
For, the doctor to meet after thoughts of the grave
In, the home of the brave and of the weak

But why'd. You have to break all my heart
Couldn't. You have saved a little bit of it. 
Why'D you have to break all my heart. 
Couldn'T, you have saved a minor part. 

I could have clipped and saved and planted in the garden
Damn. You guess I'll have to get a new one

I'd love to sit and watch. You drink
With the reins to the world gripping a smoke
Vaguely missing link
Don't ever change you hungry little bashful hound
I got the sheep poor little Bo, Peep
Has lost and filed for grounds

But why'd. You have to break all my heart
I could have ripped apart and thrown into the river
Wonder. If there's hearts that will deliver

Don't ever change, don't ever worry
Because, I'm coming back home, tomorrow
To 14th Street, where I won't hurry
And, where I'll learn, how to save not just borrow
And they'll be rainbows and we will finally know
