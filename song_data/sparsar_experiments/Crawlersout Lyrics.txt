Crawlersout Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


Sea water is flowing from the
Middle of my thighs
Wild. Buffalo are dancing, on
Cliff tops in the skies

Adorn me in feathers
From, dead birds, and
Contemplate, the size, of
Leather pelts to wind me, in
Put, shutters on my eyes

They'll cover the hills
With, their sweet flesh
And soft nails
They'll cover the doors
With, the screams that
Their minds dispose

Write it down, write it down
Down the names And dates
Of the daughters
Who bore out of me
Like grandmother's vines

They hang from the planks
Of, my cedar grave grow
Pretty, long lashes and beards
Guarding, the rain of me from them
Heedless trampling toes
Gathering honeybees
In their sockets and creases and holes

They'll cover the hills
With, their sweet flesh
And soft nails
They'll cover the doors
With. The screams that
Their minds dispose

They'll weave their long souls
Into, the frame to grow their foliage in
They'll sew their long hairs
Into their beds to keep them crawlers out
To. Keep them crawlers out
To, keep them crawlers out
To, keep them crawlers, out
Keep them crawlers, out
Keep them crawlers, out
,
