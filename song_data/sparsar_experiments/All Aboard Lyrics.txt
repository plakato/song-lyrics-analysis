All Aboard Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.


I want you to role with me.
Go wit me.
Why? So you can see what was callin' me.
The spot where they like to bounce a lot.
Pop the tops.
And ain't no cops breakin' the party up.
Any kinda shorty that you like.
You can have her slim.
Or thick at the thighs.
Y'all need to hit the club wit me.
The bubbly will keep on poppin' until 3:00.

So what.
If we wake the neighbors up.
Cause we love to club.
Turn the radio up.

All aboard.
If you wanna party some more.
Put yo hands in the air then.
Come on and get ya club on tonight.
Work hard every day and wanna play tonight.
All aboard.
If you wanna party some more.
And ya really not caring.
You trying to get yo club on tonight.
Then can't nobody stop us now.

I want you to swang wit me.
Hang wit me.
Why? To get the party off the chain wit me.
The club where the shorties ain't stuck up.
They back it up.
And ain't no thugs tearin' the party up.
The only thing they tear up is the floor.
And leave all of the haters at the door.
Y'all need to hit the club wit me.
The ladies free.
And yo that's all that we need.
