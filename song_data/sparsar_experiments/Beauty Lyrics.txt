Beauty Lyrics
by WreQ one.

Submotion Orchestra's “Perfection”.
A thousand pieces in a jigsaw of beautiful mistakes.
The debris of beauty flickers.
In the sadness of a smile.
It's the perfection of your imperfection.

If looks could kill, she would kill'em all.
&amp; she a model, but she still working at the mall.
She selling shoes; In them high heels, you bound to fall.
Every pair I wear is rare, &amp; I'm down to ball!
She's my #1 pick; John Wall.
She a ride or die chick; I keep her on call.
&amp; I'm a trip, but she down for the long haul.
She'll take a trip for me; shit, it ain't a mystery.
Me &amp; Shorty go waay back; We got history.
I'm a QUEENS kid, She's from Brooklyn.
like “Mister Cee”.
That line was For Your Miss.Info.
I'm trying to reach my peak, before I miss my window.
If you still sleeping on me, better smell the indo.
Got loud in the studio. Said she.
bringing friends;.
They're white girls on the Hootie Blow.
Tol'her Live it Up, just never let your beauty go;.
Man, she should know better, Damn she so beautiful!

A thousand pieces in a jigsaw of beautiful mistakes.
It's the perfection of your imperfection.
