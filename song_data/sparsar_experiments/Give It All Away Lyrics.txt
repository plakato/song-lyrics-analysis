Give It All Away Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

Elelele city hush!

I carry sex on my back like my father.
I carry love like my mother did.
I want to share it all with another.
Lost soul waiting there for me.
So much pain.
Too much pain.
I can't take it.
I want to give it all.
Give it all away.

I want to give it all.
Give it all away.

I want to give it all.
Give it all away.

Oh, Come on with the next one....

See you naked.
See you broken.
See you lonely.
See you praying for your freedom lost.
We destroy our past, roots, beauty.
The monuments are falling down.
For Tibet.
For burnt land.
For the black land.
For the lovers and haters.
Non believers.
And for those who.
Who pray to god.
Won't you shade a tear for our mother earth.

Gcwala ngam mfana.
Gcwala ngam mfana singorhasatsha.
Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo.
Shade a tear for our mother earth.
Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo.
Shade a tear for our mother earth.

Shade a tear....
Shade a tear.
I want to shade a tear.

He gave his life to the beats sounds music.
What man built, man burnt it all.
In my head tic toc bomb's ticking.
Soul's burning.
Heart will explode.
Tic toc bomb's ticking.

Cyber crime.

Gcwala ngam mfana.
Gcwala ngam mfana singorhasatsha.
Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo.
Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo.

Gcwala ngam mfana singorhasatsha.
Siyaliphuza siyal'phalaza.

Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo....

Yini ngathi anina verstaan.
Isifojiso.
Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo....

Siyaliphuza.
Siyal'phalaza.

Gcwala ngam mfana.
Gcwala ngam mfana singorhasatsha.
Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo.
Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo.

I'm giving it all away.
Giving it all away.
I'm giving my pain away.
I want you....
I need you....

Elelele city hush!!!
