Hollow Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


You are like a sin.
So good when I'm caving in.
I feel you inside my skin.
The dark is so welcoming.
When I see the sky.
I know theres a reason why.
I could never say goodbye.
I could never see you cry.
I'm lighting a wet match.
To see if I spark a flame.
I'll set it all on fire.
If that means I'd have no pain.
My heart feels cold and used.
My memories old and bruised.
If you left me I'd follow.
As long as you'll let me loose.

You make me feel so hollow.
But then I feel complete.
You feed me the lies I'd swallow.
My words seem obsolete.
