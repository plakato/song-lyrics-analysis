Nightmare Night Lyrics
by WoodenToaster.


Yeah.
Watchu know 'bout Nightmare Night son?

Mic the Microphone.
Welcome Fillies and Gentlecolts ;No reason to scream.
Your favorite Princess.
is back; She's walkin' up on the scene.
She has been stuck on the moon but that's no reason to fret.
She's not a Nightmare no more so buckle down and get set.
She's comin gracin' her subjects; She ain't leavin' no choice.

She's gonna blow you all back with her Equestrian voice.
So cover all of your fears and stow away all your fright.
The Lunar Princess is.
back to bring the Nightmares tonight.

She's living in the past.
So you won't last.
Without the proper care.
With a royal farewell.
And an animate spell.
You won't have long to prepare.

Mic the Microphone.
Now little fillies this is Nightmare Night.
Your ruler Nightmare Moon is back;.
To come and fill you with fright.
So Hurry.
Now get your goodies and fill up all your bags.
And go and leave a candy offering for that big ol' hag.
Get runnin'.
And pray above that she's not coming back.
To come and take away your soul and eat you up for a snack.
So run away and go hide just keep your head out of sight.
The darkness is rising again cause this is Nightmare Night.

She's living in the past.
So you won't last.
Without the proper care.
With a royal farewell.
And an animate spell.
You won't have long to prepare.
