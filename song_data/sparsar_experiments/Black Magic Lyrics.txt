Black Magic Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


Gang fight.

Mmmhmm.
They knew I had....
They knew I had that heat huh.
My shit is right by me.
Hand me that motherfuckin blunt.
This motherfucka, I gotta dry this bitch first.

Paranoia!
Dissin? my body with flames, coat this ice?
Homie, ya better be ready for war when walkin down the street at night n'.
Ready with hand on the gauge.
For niggas that run up or wanna get diesel.
Run up on me, there is no sequel.
Motherfucker, the bullet will meet you.
To bury your body in river for niggas that run up and got that?
Stop that!
Homie, because we all know where you been shot at.
This nigga wanna get down?
Heck, my niggas wanna get down too!
Run up on us and kick up dust.
Watchin how fast we clowned? you.
? a 40 ounce bottle while feelin? that ganja.
Lucifer turn on my demons to make me do everything, even if choppin off.
nostrils.
I walk in the do'.
Look for the money, for penny, then hurry and sell.
You niggas, ya better be ready and lose the first penny? just because of the.
smell.
Nigga be walkin through Hell.
Head for this murder and keepin the death.
Put one in ya nut? when I'm bussin my tech, filled off? with the tech and.
get off of the set.
This ain't the right flow....
For niggas that really don't wanna be bussin.
Step over homie, we feel that we differ, we on a mission, nigga no discussion.

Do you want to know black magic? Black magic!
Where yo ass can get smashed fo' pickin up savine That's real.
And fuckin with them psychos.
And bustin with the rifles.
We niggas best sight no What?!
Muthafuckas you ain't never seen me before you hit the do'.
? mmmm....
? like a habit Gotta have it.
So come into my room and let me teach you black magic.

It had happened one Saturday night, I was mobbin? like a muthafucka, down in.
sick and the loony? street.
Smokin on some hydroponic trees.
Me and my peep? was plottin on a come up.
Imma burn somethin like a skinny ho, can't cook in the mornin.
If you sleepin, we creepin.
Givin niggas dirt naps.
I'm hurtin, for certain.
And homie you don't wanna see Cat?
187, don't listen to eleven.
? nigga's pockets and king-sized mantles n'.
Shit's gettin funky like them ? clumps? flattenin.
Couldn't clean like a surgeon, make you bloody like a virgin.
Only God can judge me and I'm wonderin will I ever see Pac? again, I'm livin.
straight? for this life and I know I'm gonna murder somethin.
Twisted Insane got the gauge, gon' pop somethin.
If this ? go good, homie we gon' cop somethin.
Break it down, bag it up, and hit the block all in the same night, this black.
magic'll have you seein lights.

One off for the dojo.
Sufferin one to the dome ? my composure.
Circle and salt when I'm doin the voodoo and lightin a candle and urn for the.
mojo?
?
And leavin em all in the dirt.
So niggas that take out they stomach and fill em with bullets, you know about.
puttin in work.
I'm never the one to be lit in the car? ? feelin the booster.
? when off of Medusa.
40 ounce and a Ruger, dumpin on niggas that really don't wanna be fucked with.
Hop out the model when off of the bottle and catch ? slippin right in front.
of ya bucket.
Catch ya slippin right in front of ya bucket.
My niggas will brack em? all to the brain.
Look into they eyes and happen?, watch how fast these niggas ? when they.
encounter the flames.
Burnin bodies like the ashes and urns, I'm ready to learn why these niggas are.
sicker.
Dumpin with so much artillery, niggas they feelin me when I be off of the.
liquor.
Sick and the quicksand's gettin thicker.
And all the O.E. is just killin my liver.
So passionate for bein ? mixin you? with the wicked elixir.
Hopin you niggas is gettin your fixer.
Off of my shit cause I do be a savage.
Meetin your doom when you enter the room....
Black magic.
