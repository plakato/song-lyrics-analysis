Ain't a Damn Thang Changed Lyrics
by Twiztid.

Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops.
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops.
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came.
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed.
Hey yo fuck moneybacks, cadillacs.
Nice clothes, studios, hot wax, fine hoes.
Freestyles, drug sales, competition, videos, and Duck Tales fresh.
As fuck means of consignment.
All about realignment to the game.
Hometown hero, was treated like a zero.
Hate me more than ever cause now I got dinero.
In my enemies eyes I stand alone.
Blowin' in the wind just me and my microphone.
I'm like a Jedi Knight bringin' the force and the light.
Mean muggin' muthafuckas like I'm Andre the Giant.
Type of shit that start a riot, but I just begun.
Explosion C4, 3, 2, I'm 1.
Heads are bound to get cracked.
Beefs kickin' out equivalent to get whiplash.
Add a dash of ridalin just to keep me sane.
But the problem goes deeper than the cells in my brain.
Maintain for the simple fact I stack my wealth.
Because I can't help nobody till I help myself.

Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops.
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops.
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came.
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed.

Monoxide Child hey, wicked wild.
Nicotine, and THC be my style.
Profile of a serial killa that's who I be.
The T W I Z T I D.
I'm comin' with the shit to make your head explode.
Cock the hammer in my mouth, and let my tongue unload.
Road to riches, taggin' bitches.
Fuck around I'll have you sleepin' with the fishes.
Fuck is you in stitches.
You can hate me and my no good friends.
But thinkin' this shit gonna end, is all pretend.
Now lend me an ear, and I'ma scream it loud and clear.
It ain't safe for you to hang around here.
7 Mile in the hood, East side, chinese eyes when we ride.
Shit ain't even close to changed around this.
You the one actin' like a lil' bitch.
I don't know what you heard, or what you thought.
Or who you with, or who you brought.
Bitch niggas get tossed, whut?
That's right ain't a damn thang changed, but day to night.
And you ain't on the mic.
Like to recite my shit, kindly to your bitch.
So both of y'all can suck a dick.

Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops.
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops.
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came.
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed.
Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops.
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops.
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came.
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed.
Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops.
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops.
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came.
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed.
Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops.
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops.
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came.
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed.
Changed, and ain't a damn thang changed.
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody.
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody changed.
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody.
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody changed.
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody.
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody changed.
Yeah, nobody changed bitch.
Twiztid juggalos, that's how we do it on the East side.
Crank that shit.
And we out bitch, and we out bitch, and we out bitch.
Yo Monoxide crank that shit.
