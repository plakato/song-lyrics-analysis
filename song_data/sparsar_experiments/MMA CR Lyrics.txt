MMA CR Lyrics
by Zoddex.


People is been asking around.
Why we sit at the throne, why we still wearing the crown.
But that they do know.
They've been trying to creep, no matter how hard they try they know we won't.
get hit.
MMA CR we still at the top, you already know who we are.

2007 September the 15.
We train to fight, we fight to win.
That's the motto, what you didn't know about of.
The only thing that hurts, is that we started from the bottom.
Masakastsu, we didn't keep the name.
Haters want it all, we got it all, we ain't the same.
Well if you wanna win, your really gotta train.
I've been here since the beginning, the creators of the game.
Im rapping, im spitting, im yapping, im sweating, im running, im jumping, im.
kicking.
The sandbag, I want to see the opponent, tapping the mat, while he only feels.
the blood coming.
Through the nose, and the teeth to the floor falling.
See them crew, them so mad yeah cuz im winning.
Only hear myself, he screams, finish him.
Born to kill the flow im an assassin.

Lead by Example.
I tried to stay shy, but I can't be humble.
Everything I have I gotta share it with my crew.
If you dont like that, well there's nothing I can't handle.
MMA just made me, I can brag about it, and I can go crazy.
I know im kinda lazy but still you can compare the family to amazing.
We went sky-high, everybody knows it, everybody wanna a cut as I.
The other side, nothing they can try, talk too much only criticize.
No need to think twice, the ball ain't need to bounce.
Started with a few, now there's many in the house.
My heart keep pumping, the best thing I have found.
Got only 10 seconds, gotta wrap this round.

Competition, is over,they really felt high.
But the only thing they could accomplish was hover.
Not to me, cuz I know them all fake.
Not to us, we know they ain't got what it takes.
We didn't even do it cuz we the best on the race.
Single clutch, cannot keep up with pace.
Now they only show, the desire and the hate.
Used to eat from us, now theres nothin on the plate.
Im tryna to be best but trying is not enough.
Starting the engine you gotta be tough, is it hard to be rough.
No matter all the pain, the hits that it costs.
I will never get tired of it, I will never get tired of it.
I want the pain, walk inside the hall of fame.
Put the belt on my waist, and my smile on a frame.
World championship brain.
MMA already did it, and we're getting it again.
