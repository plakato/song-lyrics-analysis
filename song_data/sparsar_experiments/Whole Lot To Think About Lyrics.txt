Whole Lot To Think About Lyrics
by Wood.

You've given me a whole lot to think about.
Now leave me be.
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
Now leave me be.
I'm so confused, what should I do.
I'll take a drive to somewhere I used to go.
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
Now leave me be.
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
Now leave me be.
I need some time to clear out my mind.
If visions are true then why couldn't I see you?
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
Oh yeah, yeah.
A whole lot to think about, oh yeah.
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
You've given me a whole lot to think about.
