Pendulum Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.

You'Re, the cat's eyes
You're, the pendulum
When, the orator says
It's, your time, you're, the one

All, the natives say
You know it's your time. You'Re the one

Little fears little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
But, now you're gon na swing like a pendulum

In, your mind's eye
You see pentacles
Fortune tellers say
It's your time, you're the one
And, your wife. She says
It's your time you're the one

Little fears, little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
And, now you're gon na swing, like a pendulum

Little fears, little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
And, now you're gon na swing like a pendulum

It's, your face in the mirror
Hasn't changed through the years
And. All you do is swing like a pendulum

You're hollow, oh oh
So, hollow hollow
,
