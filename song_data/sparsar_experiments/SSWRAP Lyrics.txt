SSWRAP Lyrics
by Arash.

Here'S a little something that I've learned in SSW 
I figured I'd rap about it to ensure it wouldn't trouble. You 
I had a good start to the semester going to classes each week 
Like. My ass is in need 
Of, a higher graded mark to succeed 
So in order to meet 
The requirements that I seek 
To proceed through college 
I need knowledge. 
So I planted the seed 
Today that seed of knowledge has developed into a tree 
Cause. I put my mind in the mind frame and self fulfilled my prophecy 
My legacy. My monarchy, like peak experience, is to Maslow's hierarchy, 
The kind of stuff. We learned in Laura's class like showing empathy 
Or. I It communication which really merits frustration 
Basing. The way you treat people on occupation seems mistaken. 
When, you show respect to others in similar conversation 
When, I'm in the situation to avoid feelings of degradation. 
I take my time and reflect so that the words I choose to use always
demonstrate, respect, 
, 
The, putting down of someone's confidence and self esteem 
Is, but a means of crushing dreams. 
Like, a vulture I'm sitting upon a beam, plotting, plots, scheming, schemes
, 
Giving people, labels and names that are intentionally mean 
, 
Labels and names with intention to hurt 
Identity script since birth, 
The kinds of labels and words 
That one would, without thinking 
Tend to blurt. 
And often leave in the dirt 
A person's sense of self worth 
 
Now, I'm spitting flow on Johari's window, 
Red, yellow, blue and green. All give you self info 
I. Let my friends see the blue in me. 
They knew how to get through to me. 
I now know things I didn't before:
