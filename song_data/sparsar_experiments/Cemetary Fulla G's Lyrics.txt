Cemetary Fulla G's Lyrics
by X-Raided.


The Cemetary's full of G's, died for the cause.
Dead on Arrival, at the hospital, he died in his draws.
And a rider falls every day, no more retaliatin'.
But best believe we go to war.....

I had a dream that the Lord Almighty snatched my soul.
Saw a tombstone with my named etched in gold.
Heard my Mama cryin' Baby don't you leave me this way.
Heard my homies say Come back and represent EBK!
So many homies, in a journey, I decided on mine.
Nine millimeter slug through his shirt blew out his spine.
Coulda beat my thug to the draw, quicker than Jesse.
Hollow tips, had the crime scene bloody and messy.
Now bless these souls of the infants that died at birth.
Never witnessed the sickness that plagues the Earth.
For what it's worth, rest in peace to the ones that failed.
At least there ain't no stress, unless that ass is in Hell.
Unleash grief, on the enemies I put in the grave.
To be continued, when I see you, on judgment day.
It'll be a venue, when hot shit is all I desire.
Even if I get sentenced to burn in eternal fire.
So consumed by this rage, I'm predictin' revenge.
Got me ridin' for my homies through committin' sins.
When will you feel me? Not until we all dead and shit.
My headstone read Nefarious that's all and that's it.

The car hit the corner, felt the slug enter my chest.
Burnin' like some brimstone initiatin' the process of death.
I felt my soul slippin' into that dark abyss.
My body lettin' go, bowel movement and then I piss.
My soul lifts, closed eyes, lookin' down at the scenery.
Thinkin' Oh no that can't be me with intestines layin' in the street.
Send the sheet, cover me up, stuff me into the body bag and close it.
Feel my body bloatin', I feel my body floatin'.
I know my enemies gloatin', smokin' blunts and celebratin'.
X-Raided Loc is dead!
Just maybe either Heaven or Hell is waitin', now my vision's fadin'.
Purgatory is my home.
My soldiers heard the story, so now it's on nigga.

Now don't you cry for me, FUCK pourin' out your rum.
Round up the thugs and watch slugs pourin' out your gun.
And it's begun, enemies best to run from dusk til' dawn.
Got a vendetta, seekin' revenge like that nigga from spawn.
You a pawn and I'm the King, but you the one that's in check.
Black roses on your grave, ultimate disrespect.
Collected obituary pages for the lives thats ending.
Step into the mortuaries daily, so many funerals attended.
I never intended to be a thug but destiny drug me in.
Grim Reaper already got a grave to plug me in.
No way around it, one of these days I'm gonna have to meet the creator.
Nobody on Earth is perfect, I hope God ain't a PLAYA HATER.
