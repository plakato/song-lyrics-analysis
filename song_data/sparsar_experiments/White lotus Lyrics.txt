White lotus Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


I'Ve always had a thing for your type 
Dark hues into light, 
Unconditional delight 
Just. How I like 
, 
White, 
, 
Later i'd, realize 
This was the highest i'd ever be 
More bangs than weatherby 
Attempts to meddle me 
Succeeded. You had me right where you pleased 
Figured you liked to envelop me when you reduced me to knees, 
Uninhibited animalistic acts of vices 
While. Every glance in the mirror is an identity crisis. 
But know i- 
Attained a level of bliss. I hope i never miss 
Immobilized to the walls with which you hold me against 
The sweetest, kiss 
The freedom hits 
Savvy at whipping up white on the tips. 
Limitless descriptions of the gist of this 
Emulations of some kind of goddess 
Clothed in a kimono, cease the modesty 
It drove my artistry 
Withdrawals throughout my body due to the scarcity 
Endured a couple of ages. I wish a sage for I need seasoning. 
What can be done for me this evening. 
I feel you feel the plot deepening 
Feeling invincible, like qin, shi, huang 
Kept me solid as terracottas each time that time came 
Using you invigorated my chi 
A belief, 
I felt sublime 
Didn't even need a bonsai tree. 
Too must history to become history: 
Allies say it sickened, thee 
But, they were peripheries, but isles off. The bank 
The course of true lust, never did run smooth 
All I desired by the set 
Was just a cup full of you 
Adjacent to the sea of sin, 
Oh. What a wondrous view 
In your garden! I admire cherry blossoms right by the yews 
Can. I have it all back. 
I probably couldn't attain the same height. 
But delight is delight. 
And, it's one hell of a sight. 
I was quite accustomed to you, 
Quite a custom to you. 
 
I've always had a thing for your height 
Slim slits, into wide 
Free as the tide 
Just. What i like
