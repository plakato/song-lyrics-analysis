White lotus Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


I've always had a thing for your type.
Dark hues into light.
Unconditional delight.
Just how I like.

White.

Later i'd realize.
This was the highest i'd ever be.
More bangs than weatherby.
Attempts to meddle me.
Succeeded you had me right where you pleased.
Figured you liked to envelop me when you reduced me to knees.
Uninhibited animalistic acts of vices.
While every glance in the mirror is an identity crisis.
But know i-.
Attained a level of bliss i hope i never miss.
Immobilized to the walls with which you hold me against.
The sweetest kiss.
The freedom hits.
Savvy at whipping up white on the tips.
Limitless descriptions of the gist of this.
Emulations of some kind of goddess.
Clothed in a kimono, cease the modesty.
It drove my artistry.
Withdrawals throughout my body due to the scarcity.
Endured a couple of ages i wish a sage for I need seasoning.
What can be done for me this evening.
I feel you feel the plot deepening.
Feeling invincible like qin shi huang.
Kept me solid as terracottas each time that time came.
Using you invigorated my chi.
A belief.
I felt sublime.
Didn't even need a bonsai tree.
Too must history to become history.
Allies say it sickened thee.
But they were peripheries, but isles off the bank.
The course of true lust never did run smooth.
All I desired by the set.
Was just a cup full of you.
Adjacent to the sea of sin.
Oh, what a wondrous view.
In your garden i admire cherry blossoms right by the yews.
Can I have it all back?
I probably couldn't attain the same height.
But delight is delight.
And it's one hell of a sight.
I was quite accustomed to you.
Quite a custom to you.

I've always had a thing for your height.
Slim slits into wide.
Free as the tide.
Just what i like.
