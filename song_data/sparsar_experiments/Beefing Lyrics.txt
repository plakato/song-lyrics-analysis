Beefing Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

Huh!
Ha!
Yea.

Let me tell you a little story about....
About this nigga I knew....
This nigga I knew....
Jus-Just....

Look.

You was my nigga, now we beefin'.
Im bustin' at you.
You bustin' at me.
And it won't stop till we both sleepin'.

We was claimin' the same hood.
Fucked the same bitches.
And they knew.
If I hit it, you had to hit it too.
We was crew.
You was with me when I first pulled the trigger.
You tried to shoot too, but your gun jammed.
So we pulled off..ya remember?
I hid by your mama house for a couple of days.
Cause the niggas we was beefin' with knew where I stayed.
We were some down south niggas.
Bootin' 'em out niggas.
The wrong route niggas....
Typical niggas.
We just nickel and dime it.
Sellin' weed...to the needy.
Everything be 50-50.
Ain't no need for being greedy.
You my dogg, huh?
So thats how we played it.
Niggas who hated....
We rushin' them and demonstrated.
While we ain't to be faded.
On this mission to get money, power, and bitches.
Or whatever come along with these riches.
That's if nobody snitches.
I'd do a BID for ya.
Take care of your KID for ya.
But damn!
Look what these pussy niggas done did to ya.

phone rings.

-Hello??
-Yeah, nigga, whats happenin'?
-Whats happenin' with ya dogg?
-Nigga, whats happenin' with you nigga?
Talking about you got some beef with me nigga.
-Beef wit' you? Nigga you know I'm a real nigga.
If I had some beef with you.
I'd come to you like a man dogg...It ain't like that between us.
See what it is, is....
You talkin' to these niggas...and these niggas got you goin'.

Them niggas told you I blew up.
And I forgot about us.
The same niggas who was with you and afraid to bust.
How could you listen to these niggas?
When they mean no good.
Mothafuckers ain't even from our hood.
And know you snortin' furl with 'em.
Off in that world with 'em.
And Father forgive him.
He dance to some other rhythm.
Ever thought that we could work it out?
We would meet.
But as long as you with them niggas.
I'll be with that heat.
And thats deep.
Cause I made a promise to your mama when we was only 12.
I'll deliver you from evil and keep you alive and well.
Guess I gotta disappoint her.
But you leave me no choice....
Callin' my crib, with this murder-murder tone in your voice.
What...I'm a bitch or somethin'?
I used to fight for ya.
Used to let you stay at my mama crib.
When shit jsut wasn't right for ya.
Look what you do me in return....
I guess I played with fire.
So eventually it burns.
Nigga.

-Hello? Hello?
Man this nigga done fuckin' hung up on me.
Y'all think that nigga serious?

It's world war nigga.
