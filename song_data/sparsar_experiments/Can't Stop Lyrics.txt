Can't Stop Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


I lost everyone I cared for.
If I lose another girl I will go and get more.
Tell em I love her man, okay I lie too.
She fell for me, okay thats cool.
Her heart need fixing but I ain't got that tool.
I can only buy her shoes.
If I make it you will probably make the news.
Star girlfriend, thats all they care about.
But I will probably leave your ass.
For a hollywood ass.
Man these girls don't act right.
How many roles have you played huh?
How many niggas have you banged huh?
18 years and you are on twenty two, twenty two.

Thats the shit that makes me love less.
I'm screaming fuck all your feelings I couldn't care less.
These bitches made me so huh heart less.
Where you know me from? ah ah you are a hot mess.

Breaking hearts fucking bitches.
I can't stop.
Breaking hearts fucking bitches.
I can't stop.
Breaking hearts fucking bitches.
I can't stop 3 Times.

These bitches switching teams.
I'm just switching timbs.
Tryna get me rims.
The dopest nigga living.
Should see the lifestyle that I'm living.
Rockstar shit, I'm on my Kurt Cobain.
I overdose on sex, weed and cocain.
Im numb to this shit, I feel no pain.
I am on my propain.
Breaking hearts fucking bitches.
I can't stop.
You know something weird about this love.
The ones that love us are the ones that we dont.
And the ones that we love are only using us, losing us.
Let me tell you about this crazy flash back.
I met shawty from the down south.
She had a big back.
She said she got a men.
But she would leave his broke ass.
For my rapping ass.
Ma ma ma nigga say what.
This tha tha that betrayal.
These hoes ain't even lo lo loyal.
They tryna use a nigga for the ca ca cash bra.
They say it ain't tricking if you got it.
But what will happen if I go and loose it.
This what I been trained to do.
I swear this ain't something new.
Just something cool.

Ah, shit.
I can't stop, never never, ever ever.
Yeah.
