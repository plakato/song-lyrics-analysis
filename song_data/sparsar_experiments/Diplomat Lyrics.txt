Diplomat Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

Live to work, work to live.
No time left to spend or give.
Walking like a bureaucrat.
Talking like a diplomat.

Always looking into their eyes.
Firm handshakes, quick replies.
Push the product, sell the crop.
Climb that ladder to the top.

But what if it's not meant for me?
I can't stand the symmetry.
My head is stuck inside the clouds.
But I can see clearly now.

I'm trying to find the means to living more passionately.
Cause I'm not who I wanna be.
Buried in routines, I don't care what happens to me.
I just gotta get free.

I am no proprietor.
That that to my dear father.
Taught me everything he knew.
About nothing that I wanna do.

Earned awards, honors, degrees.
I couldn't find myself in these.
So I took my car keys and ID's.
And threw them in the ocean.

Now, all of the world is laying right before my eyes.
I wonder why the hell it took so long for me to recognize.

I'm trying to find the means to living more passionately.
Cause I'm not who I wanna be.
Buried in routines, I don't care what happens to me.
I just gotta get free.
