Whittier Blvd. (Remix) Lyrics
by The Wow.

KO THE LEGEND.

Name a cat.
You know that.
Raps as.
Hot as me.
I'm the fuckin'best.
Swear to God.
I gotta be.
Droppin' knowledge.
On these niggas.
Like I'm.
Socrates.
Puff a lotta trees.
And I gotta.
Lotta creez.
Shot to future.
I'm on that.
Kara-te chop.
Flow.
Den-im from Japan.
That's Do-mo Ori-Ga-to.
Me and Getty.
Out in Vegas.
On the top floor.
W-O-W.
How could you not know.

Different city different women.
When I'm wakin' up.
Lovin' how I'm livin'.
I could never make it up.
Chasin' paper.
I can never make enough.
Married to the game.
We never breakin' up.
Laughin at Gravity.
Swaggin like.
Nigga this can't be physics.
Feelin' like I'm the Eurhythmics.
I'm puffin that Annie Lennox.
Sweet Dreams.
We bring what the street needs.
PurpleHaus.
Cheers Club.
Just for the street fiends.

This shit is all that I know.
Spit these flows, and get this d.o.e.
This shit is all that I know.
Spit these flows, and get this d.o.e.
Comin down and I'm ridin'.
Damn right I'm ridin'.
Comin down and I'm ridin'.
Damn right I'm ridin'.
Comin down and I'm ridin'.
Damn right I'm ridin'.
Comin down and I'm ridin'.
Damn right I'm ridin'.

I wear my chains all in my house.
Big couch like Scarface.
I'm lightin up on that pound.
Now them ripped jeans that's Balmain.
Cheers Club we the realest.
If them shoes fit then I get em.
When I move through.
Wit my cool crew.
I'm like vroom vroom.
Yeah I ditch.
Puff them dutch masters.
Jeans full of them plush fabrics.
I must have it.
Touch V-C they bust at you.
That L-V V-C must have it.
Young bosses, shareholders.
Stock prices and Range Rovers.
Play to win yo game over.
Them bad bitches they stayin over.
That Roley on my wrist.
I got that cuban on my neck.
I know you see I'm on some shit.
Boost them sales bust that check.
Hands up for the realsist niggas that's breathin'.
Real niggas they feel me.
Bad bitch I beat that up all night and film it.
