Whittier Blvd. (Remix) Lyrics
by The Wow.

Ko THE LEGEND 
 
Name, a cat 
You know that 
Raps as 
Hot as me, 
I'm the fuckin'best 
Swear to God. 
I got ta, be 
Droppin' knowledge 
On these niggas 
Like, I'm 
Socrates 
Puff a lotta trees 
And. I got ta 
Lotta creez 
Shot to future 
I'm on that 
Kara-te chop 
Flow 
Den-im from Japan, 
That's Do-mo, Ori-Ga-to 
Me and Getty 
Out in Vegas 
On the top floor. 
W-O-W 
How. Could you not know 
 
Different city, different women, 
When, I'm wakin' up 
Lovin' how I'm livin' 
I could never make it up. 
Chasin' paper 
I can never make enough 
Married to the game. 
We, never breakin' up 
Laughin at Gravity 
Swaggin like 
Nigga. This can't be physics 
Feelin', like I'm, the Eurhythmics 
I'm puffin that Annie Lennox 
Sweet Dreams, 
We bring what the street needs. 
Purplehaus 
Cheers Club 
Just for the street fiends 
 
This shit is all that I know 
Spit these flows and get this d.o.e 
This shit is all that I know 
Spit these flows and get this d.o.e 
Comin down and I'm ridin' 
Damn right, I'm ridin' 
Comin down and I'M ridin' 
Damn right, I'm ridin' 
Comin down and I'm ridin' 
Damn right, I'm ridin' 
Comin down and I'm ridin' 
Damn right, I'm ridin', 
 
I wear my chains. All in my house, 
Big couch, like Scarface 
I'm, lightin up on that pound 
Now them ripped jeans. That'S Balmain! 
Cheers Club we, the realest, 
If them shoes fit. Then I get em 
When. I move through 
Wit my cool crew 
I'm like vroom vroom 
Yeah. I ditch 
Puff them dutch masters, 
Jeans full of them plush fabrics. 
I must have it 
Touch V-C they bust at you, 
That L-V V-C must have it. 
Young bosses, shareholders, 
Stock prices and Range Rovers 
Play to win yo game over 
Them bad bitches. They stayin over 
That Roley on my wrist 
I got that cuban on my neck. 
I know you see I'm on some shit, 
Boost them sales bust, that check 
Hands up for the realsist niggas, that's breathin', 
Real niggas. They feel me 
Bad bitch. I beat that up all night and film it
