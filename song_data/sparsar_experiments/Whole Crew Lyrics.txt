Whole Crew Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Punishment is not enough for you.
I love it when you love to bring your whole crew.
They're lookin' good all tucked inside.
The loving grasp of all of their waistlines.
So grab a throat, act like you know.
Yeah it won't hurt, if he don't grow older.

Didn't wanna hurt him.
But what with everyone watching.
Kick until you feel the lungs collapse.
And hear the coughing.
We aren't so different you and I.
But that distinction might keep us both sane.
Sane, sane.

Cold crew now.
I told you once to tell the pack.
Told you what to say and then you took it right back.
Whole crew is graves in the yard.
Whole crew is graves crouched behind the car.
Whole crew is graves piled in your high school.
Might be a coward but I'm hip to it.
Might be a coward but I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid to quit.

We aren't so different, no you and I.
But that distinction might keep us sane.
