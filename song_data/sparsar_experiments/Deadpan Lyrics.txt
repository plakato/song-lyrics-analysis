Deadpan Lyrics
by Sworn In.

I Can't tell what's right from wrong.
Maybe I've been emotionless all along.
Mouth full of blood.
What have I done?
Disgusted with myself.
Delighted with none.
Can you outrun the shadow I cast?
You better pray that you can run fucking fast.
The sun's gone down and you're left for dead.
Get out of my head.
I'm better off dead.
You may have tricked them but you haven't tricked me.
Pull off that mother fucking mask you seem to wear so easily.
Fuck you and fuck the whole entire human race.
When I am through with you.
The world will see your fucking true face.
I can't close my eyes, can't close my eyes.
All I see is all I despise.
And I cried to deaf ears.
You were all that I feared but now I can't feel.
I can't close my fucking eyes.
I can't be alive.
I can't close my fucking eyes.
And I sure as hell can't be fucking alive.
Mouth full of blood.
What have I done?
Disgusted with myself.
Delighted with none.
