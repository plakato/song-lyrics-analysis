The Now and the Not Yet Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

No longer what we were before.
But not all that we will be.
Tomorrow, when we lock the door.
On all our compromising.
When He appears.
He'll draw us near.
And we'll be changed by His glory.
Wrapped up in His glory.....

We will be like Him.
For we shall see Him.
As He is.

No longer what we saw before.
But not all that we will see.
Tomorrow, when we lock the door.
On all our disbelieving.
When He appears.
Our view will clear.
And we'll be changed by His glory.
Wrapped up in His glory.....

But I'm caught in between.
The now and the not yet;.
Sometimes it seems like.
Forever and ever.
That I've been reaching to be.
All that I am.
But I'm only a few steps nearer.
Yet I'm nearer.....

No longer what we were before.
But not all that we will be.
Tomorrow, when we lock the door.
On all our disbelieving.
And He appears.
He'll draw us near.
And we'll be changed by His glory.
Wrapped up in His glory.....

When He appears.
He'll draw us near.
And we'll be changed by His glory.
Wrapped up in His glory.....
