Bitch Ain't Shit Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..


{Tec-9}.

Ah shit now I'm kind of in a fit.
Them suckers locked me up now they treat me like a bitch.
I don't have no remorse for all the crimes that I did.
But still doesn't mean you have to treat me like a pig.
I'm standin' on my own I got to make it in that world.
I'm havin' thoughts of another nigga peepin' down on my girl.
Well anyway that's why I'm in this bitch tryin' please a bitch.
Pullin' all capers to get the bitch hair fixed.
You tellin' me I'm crazy but love is a motherfucker.
Couldn't find a job I turned to sellin' cluckers.
Makin' bank buyin' cars all that flashy ass shit.
Now a days that's the only way a man can keep a bitch.
You tellin' me you love why the fuck I'm out of smokes.
It wasn't all that when I was up to sellin' dope.
Puttin' clothes on yo back thinkin' you was all that.
Now that I'm facin' time you dropped me like a bad habit.
Funny how a bitch can use a nigga for his ends.
An ride around town in my car with her friends.
She tellin' me that she love me and tellin' me she legit.
But Tec is here to tell you a bitch ain't shit.

Now these is for the hoes I can't trust.
A bitch ain't shit.
She play you for your ends and.
Spend it up with her friends.
I'm here to tell you.

{Lil' Ya}.

Well my situation is kind of strange.
I was fuckin' the bitches an breakin' the hoes.
Because I got game but when I made me.
A mutherfuckin' song same hit hoes jock me.
Cuz they know I got it goin' on.
They started playin' the role that I used to play.
Buy me some tents fuck me good then I'm on my way.
But they can't get jack.
Bitch I ain't with you.
You can suck my dick and step the fuck back.
Cuz Lil' Ya is the same o'l nigga trick.
I got to get into yo pockets so I can make mine bigger bitch.
You can try to run game and make me think your my fuckin' queen.
But I'm a treat you with this dick like Halloween.
Ya try to play me out but you played me to close.
The only thing you got left is this dick down yo throat hoe.
Bitches just today ain't shit you got to treat 'em bad.
To make the stupid hoes legit so get yo mind right.
And wind up nigga ya givin' her all yo time and money.
Bitch is gonna leave ya now fela's don't play ya self.
Like a trick Cuz Ya's here to tell you.
That a bitch ain't shit.

Now these is for the hoes I can't trust.
A bitch ain't shit.
Don't be a fuckin' dummy because she play.
You for your money fool.
I'm here to tell you.

{Yella Boy}.

Now I never ever got the fuckin' attention.
That I thought I should have had.
Hoes are playin' me to the left.
Ain't that cold ain't that sad.
Might not hang out with fela's or might not.
Hang out just as late.
But you make my fuckin' day.
If I can take you out on a date.
When I called you smiled you used to say.
A nigga was cute when a nigga needed a ride.
You never ever stopped to scoop.
You claim you changed my diapers and you.
Knew me since birth I rather smoke weed.
And gee you ass to the hearst.
I asked you for your number cuz I thought you would chill.
But you looked me up and down like I was poppin' boo-koo pills.
Size don't matter because a nigga can be gay.
Way back in the pin a gangster couldn't get no play.
Real gangster gangster pictures used to blow my high.
Takin' a hit started guessin' but quiet as I crep.
Just imagine a player wish a hoe would get with this.
Givin' me faces winked her eye and blew me a kiss.
Some said that I was young some said I was dumb.
I was very grown for my age my dick was still shootin' cum.
But I must not be legit but like a fiend you got me sick.
That's why I wrote this damn song because a.
Bitch ain't shit.

Now these is for the hoes I can't trust.
A bitch ain't shit.
She'll act like she's down but you'll.
Find out in the end.
I'm here to tell you.

{Tec-9}.

Money talks shit walks and I'll be out in a week.
And it won't be long before I'm back up on my feet.
An them stanky ass hoes who took everything.
That I had is walkin' around that same neighborhood.
Lookin' bad fuckin' anything that walk.
Just to get a fuckin' hit I'm fiendin' for a nut.
So you can suck up on my dick.
I remember those times I kept your pockets fat.
An if you was in trouble I was slangin' my gat.
Bustin' heads cuttin' throats all that for that.
Dog Hoe.
