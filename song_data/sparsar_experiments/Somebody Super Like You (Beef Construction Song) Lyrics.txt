Somebody Super Like You (Beef Construction Song) Lyrics
by The Undead.

We need a man that is simple perfection.
There's nothing that's harder to find.
Someone to lead us protect us and feed us.
And help us to make up our minds.
We need a man that's sophisticated.
Quiet and strong and well educated.
Where to go what to do.
Could it be somebody super like you.

We need a man that can stand as a symbol.
And symbols have got to be tall.
Someone with taste and the tiniest waist.
With his help would not life be a ball.
If we had fun he would not restrain us.
If we got caught he would just explain us.
Where to go what to do.
Could it be somebody super like you.

We pledge allegiance to his gracefulness and charming manners.
With a voice that's both sides choice he'll bring us to our knees in.
admiration.
He is king of all who see and hear his perfect pitch.
And more surprises when his time is come a stallion rises.

We need a man with a head on his shoulders a nose that is simply divine.
Hollywood smile and a perfect profile and with eyes that would sparkle and.
shine.
Long flowing hair for a crowning glory.
There'd be a man who could tell our story.
Where to go what to do.
Could it be somebody super like you.

We pledge allegiance to his gracefulness and charming manners.
With a voice that's both sides choice he'll bring us to our knees in.
admiration.
He is king of all who see and hear his perfect pitch.
And more surprises when his time is come a stallion rises.
Rises...rises...rises.
