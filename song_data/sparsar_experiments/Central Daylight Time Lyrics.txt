Central Daylight Time Lyrics
by Wrinkle Neck Mules.

The roof blew off the club in Oklahoma City.
The fireman said, “the show can't go on”.
So we spent another night somewhere in New Mexico.
Drinking until all our money was gone.
We had a day to kill so we climbed up a mountain.
Walked straight down the other side.
Picked up a hitch-hiker on the way back to Taos.
She said, “thank you boys for the ride”.

If I could separate what's real from what I've been dreaming.
I could live to fight another day.
If I'd have listened to my mom.
When she said don't be believing everything those writers say.
There's no line at the door.
And only thirty people bothered to advance pay.
If I could separate what's real from what I've been dreaming.
I could live to fight another day.

We unpacked everything and we set it all up.
To play three songs on a radio show.
Well, you never can tell if anyone is listening.
And I guess it won't kill us what we don't know.
So we play them just the same and we tell them our name.
And where to find us on the computer screen.
When we're packing it up I hear Stu on the phone saying.
“Baby I'm living the dream”.

If I could separate what's real from what I've been dreaming.
I could live to fight another day.
If I had listened to my mom when she said.
Don't be believing everything those writers say.
There's no line at the door.
And only twenty people bothered to advance pay.
If I could separate what's real from what I've been dreaming.
I could live to fight another day.

We gotta sell ten T-shirts and twenty CDs.
To get from Stephenville to Houston town.
Well there's people there who care a little about me.
And you know they won't let the poor boy down.
It was 5:29 Central Daylight time.
When the five of us come strolling in.
And its smiles all around cause its 76 hours.
Before we got to be leaving again.

If I could separate what's real from what I've been dreaming.
I could live to fight another day.
If I had listened to my dad who said.
Don't be beleivin' everything that them writers say.
There's no line at the door.
And only five people bothered to advance pay.
If I could separate what's real from what I've been dreaming.
I could live to fight another day.
If I could separate what's real from what I've been dreaming.
I could live to fight another day.
