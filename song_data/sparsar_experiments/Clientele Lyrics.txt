Clientele Lyrics
by Sway.

**The lines in  are a sample from Nas**.

What's up my niggas?

How y'all feelin?

Check it out.
Yo.

Yo.
Niggas need ta quit it actin' like they betta.
Before I wear em out like a fitta wit a matchin sweater.
Plus I'm wantin shoes, I'm runnin through cools wit cheddar.
Makin em crack like leatha unda tha rainy weather.
Y'all best ta get it together before you step into Dirty's domain.
This cold game got you switchin identities and code names.
I went from enough ta mo game, growin like rogaine.
Keepin my face posted up in dope frames.
I throw flames then I tame em like a fireman.
And put a grip on this industry like supplies can.
Y'all don't understand I'm a wiser man wit a hot hand.
That'll drop and permantally put you on a Kaizer plan.
Stretch you out in a stretcher for thinkin why me.
I'm thinkin why these why me didn't know where tha poison is like IV.
It's drive ta handle hands like Allan Ivry.
Hand in tha B-ball's, even though tha odds be ivory.
I'm lethal, I put holes in all types of people.
From asian ta caucasian, I'm dazin em wit no sequel.
No one is equal ta tha 3, that's a pity.
Just stay on your matress packs and watch us on Rap City.

Ice man spit gold, bullets, and diamond shells.

Contagous tha MC, ill it in sickle-cell.

Pronoun'll lock it down so MC's can't post bail.

Dirty pop rounds and stomp grounds where lions dwell.

Yo.
What?
I'm an assasin blastin, brothas talkin out they ass.
And flashin a .45 colt to yo throat, leave in yo casket.
Rockin mo ice aspen, diamonds tha size of asprins.
Walk wit a Dirty limp, I talk wit tha Dirty accent.
Way my rhymes a touch ya like sexual harrasement.
50 percent violation and 50 percent on cashmen.
Faster than Nascar, pull like a tow guard.
I flow hard, chargin by tha minute like a phone card.
Disquinshed gentlemen, sweatin brothas like penaltints.
Smokin middle tin, blackin mouths, clockin benjamins.
Rockin timbalands, lockin down tha dirty premesises.
Cake time is unlimited, from championships ta scrimages.
So fly, we defy tha laws of gravity.
Anatomy of a king so u can crown me like cavity.
Nigga that's Pronoun, Dirty Unit historical.
I answer to nobody, keep questions rhetorical.
Wit mo action, whippin ass like Joe Jackson.
If you see it contain jus, remain tha future attraction.
Main event offense, you can't contain tha prevent.
Concrete for a line of defense that's hard as cement.

Ice man spit gold, bullets, and diamond shells.

Contagous tha MC, ill it in sickle-cell.

Pronoun'll lock it down so MC's can't post bail.

Dirty pop rounds and stomp grounds where lions dwell.

I rip tha mic wit tha force of a black hole on a intergaltic plateau.
Tha rhymin weapon, spittin faster than bullet shadows.
I smack clones, divorcin my thoughts wit cracked bones.
And when I rhyme I give more lines than tapped phones.
Damage ya beach, burnin tracks wit flamable speech.
Tha rappin atangable beast with animal teeth.
Battlin me is like goin to hell askin for heat.
Cause I'm rougha than leatha and tougha than african feet.
Walkin these scandolous streets like an evangelist priest.
Keepin it heated like Cool J and Canibus beef.
I rip your vocal cords, put a body in every morgue.
Wit heavy metaphors hittin harda than every George.
I hurt you perpatrators wit fire ta burn you hatas.
I'm bigga than Pun, wit more guns than a terminator.
Tha astronaut, spittin more watts than a Magnavox.
Wit more data in my memory bank than a Macintosh.
I'm so ill I could take a bath in hot lava.
And not even botha ta break a sweat, you facin death.
Goin against Dirty Unit, Sway and Tech, tha world famous.
Colaboration break your necks.

Ice man spit gold, bullets, and diamond shells.

Contagous tha MC, ill it in sickle-cell.

Pronoun'll lock it down so MC's can't post bail.

Dirty pop rounds and stomp grounds where lions dwell.
