Blue Sea Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

You say that something is not right.
And I can't tolerate.
Forget what we don't understand.
We can handle it.
If only you and me could cross the blue sea.
If only you and me could cross the blue sea.

Why break the promise.
I dont want to let you down.
Just want to make everything right.
If I lost it.
If I lost it.
If I lost you.
If only you and me could cross the blue sea.
If only you and me could cross the blue sea.

Go to the other side.

Just want to make everything right.
If only you and me could cross the blue sea.
Cross the blue sea.
