Glock Luv Lyrics
by Black Kray.


Glock love.
Bust your Glock.

She want a thug to ride on 26s.
I'm a young nigga, I don't fuck with sixes.
Triple 7, posted up in heaven.
Velour blunts, cause a young nigga be stressin.
I got a goth hoe and she straight out of Maxis.
And on the flip phone so young nigga ain't textin.
I'm on my chirp phone, I'm posted like a young hoe.
Gold slugs in my mouth looking like hoes.
I'm in the south with KayKay, yeah he posted.
I'm with my cousins and you know they got them Glocks out.
I be coolin, my blood buz he be boolin.
Repping crip gang, blunts fat like Gucci.

Glock love x20.
