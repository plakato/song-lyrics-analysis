10 Year Freestyle Lyrics
by Russ.

Nadie me va a joder 
Odio, a todo el mundo, 
Yo creo que soy mejor que todo el mundo, 
Y tu, sabes, qu√©, 
Yo quiero que todo el mundo, lo, sepa 
 
Yuh, I'm cool on your opinion of my strategy, 
Phone full of women. All mad at me 
Cause they ain't on my mind like they use to 
Cause. I ain't got the time that I use to 
Money tight as usual, but it's cool because it's coming 
And, I don't ever follow your strut. 
I, don't ever follow money. I just follow my gut 
Now. They following Russ 
Yeah, your boys, gettin bigger now 
Y'all careers dying, start pouring out the liquor now 
Been at this since 06 
Before, it started being cool to drop albums with no hits 
I'm out here coming for all of it. 
I want all the acknowledgment 
I want all the accomplishments. 
I want cars. That'S astonishing, 
Plus. The house that my mommas in 
Should be big as a continent. 
I make good on my promises. 
50 bitches to party with 
Man the world is my audience. 
I'M, just tryna' give my statement 
Billboard from a basement, 
The type of focus where you wonder where the day went. 
But, do it all again 
How to be a millionaire 
It's, getting harder to call a friend, 
Too many hidden agendas, 
You 50/50, with your character, 
My life is on the line. 
There'S gone always be a barrier 
Between me and most 
I, never let'em too close 
With. The girls, it's no different 
I can't be falling for hoes 
That's. Why? I keep to myself 
I stay, recording tryna' upgrade 
My life to the nights full of lights, cash and runways. 
I haven't had a Monday since 18 
I knew in high school. I could go pro like KG 
Lately, it's been looking like. I made the right decision, 
Found my way, outta' the dark. I got ta' flash light vision, 
If her ass right, but the face left then I'm dippin' 
I need a chick three for three, like Pippin 
Hang. My jersey up, It's worthy of the rafters 
I, know their game. I ain't worried'bout these rappers 
It's too predictable. Now it's so political now, 
And Im! Sorry if I sound a little cynical now, 
It's just that most my favorite rappers are invisible. Now 
Everyday I make a song: that's just habitual now: 
 
Refrain Russ 
Ain't, nobody gon na'! Do it like me, 
Ain't nobody gon na fill the void. I see but me so here I go. 
 
Twelve shots like the cops. Now I'm wasted 
It's in the blood of America to be racist, 
Land of the taken 
Home of the cover it all up and don't say shit 
Act, like it ain't happen, cut copy paste. It 
Put it on every channel. Doesn'T matter if you change it 
I'm off it, though 
It ain't where I've gone 
It's, where I've got ta, go 
I tell these local girls what they wan na' know: 
Never fuck'em twice cause. I won't be there to catch em, 
Self belief and a passion. This is the natural reaction 
I be singing these ballads 
Like, a young Mike Bolton 
Sprewell with the raps, though 
Like Russ might choke him 
Keep a few eyes open 
I'm everywhere, I'm omnipresent 
Wired, with the drive of a Bugatti engine 
I've been running non. Stop since fourteen 
Ain't no time to slow up man, I need more beats. 
Even, though I got 500 siting in a playlist 
I'm starting to realize that the money won't change shit 
I'm, starting to realize that y'alls basic ain't, my basic 
On, the plane to the A making a list of all the shit matters. 
Y'All opinions didn't make it 
'Bout to be a A list. Celebrity 
Wife me up a singer. 
Hope, she got ta' accent 
Hope, she drinks, liquor, 
Board of advisors. I can count on four fingers: 
Leave the middle one, open 
To. Let you know I ain't sweet 
I've been a shepherd. My whole life 
I can't relate to the sheep. 
It'S, a shame. You asleep 
But, I'm about to make your bed shake 
Bow down to me. I'M the Sensei 
Let's play who's gon, be here in a decade, 
Lotta yall are barely even making it to the next day. 
 
Man, 
The, fuck, 
The fuck, are y'all doing man 
You out here. Getting ply, phones and shit 
Turning up talking'bout, dumb shit, 
Man 
And, the crazy shit is that, like people believe you because you're poppin' 
So, you can say whatever you want, 
But, that shit sound dumb as fuck 
And, all y'all got low, fucking IQs 
And, all y'all figure Out, what's poppin' off in the water like twenty-eight, 
Cause, y'all lack guidance and that's not- 
Man me Bugus and DIEMON'bout to come through fuck all y'all up, 
Cause y'all mutha' fukka's are dumb as shit 
It's. Just that simple 
We're smart as fuck with good music, 
Fuck off
