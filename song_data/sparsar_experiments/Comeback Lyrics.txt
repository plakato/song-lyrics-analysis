Comeback Lyrics
by 420Chainz.


Refrain 420 Chainz.

Had to take a trip.
Now I'm on my Comeback.

Six figures on my wrist.
Seven on my phone.
So many bitches on me.
I can never be alone.

420, 420.
Hoes on my dick.
Beating all these bitches.
You can call me Michael Vick.

Stunting on your bitch.
Even though I'm a youngin'.
I beat ya' ass up nigga.
Cuz' you know I, stay muggin'.

Fuck Nick Bean, I'm over that.
Fuck Nick Bean, I brought it back.
Too much money.
Make a stack.
420 on my neck bitch.
Break ya' back.

Never beat the house.
Cuz' I'm always dealing.
And I got my 68'.
Only when I'm wheeling.
Chrome to ya' dome.
Only when I'm killing.

Born in the Trap.
Killed in the Trap.

Man I swear it's coming back.

Breakdown 1.

Refrain 420 Chainz.

Had to take a trip.
Now I'm on my Comeback.

I mean fuck that.
I mean step back.
I mean smack that.

No Chris Brown.
No Akon.
I'm too big.
Like King Kong.
Knock knock.
No ding dong.
I steal your girl to.
This song.

Dinosaur 69 lay it on the track.
All these bitches hating on me.
Need to fall back.
I roll with the realest.
But I ain't a politician.
I keep the beat correct.
But I ain't a technician.

Popping off these shots.
The bass still kicking.
Fresh car that I'm rolling in.
New Slave whipping.

Everywhere I go.
I am sizzurp sipping.
And my line's so dope.
You will never see me flipping.

Spitting this fire.
I could burn a fucker down.
Smoking all this Kush.
I am never turning down.

I stay high.
That's jet time.
Got two girls.
Thats two dimes.
I'm Two-Ten.
Two-Times.
So many problems.
I got two 9's.

I shoot it up like Newtown.
And I blow it up like Boston.
Killing nigga's left and right.
Because they, just talkin'.

Breakdown 2.

Refrain 420 Chainz.

Had to take a trip.
Now I'm on my Comeback.

Karma's a bitch.
But a bitch I like to fuck.
She's always on my dick.
But she never down to suck.

Ballin' on the hardwood.
Never scuff my shit.
Never fuck with me.
Cuz' I'll probably fuck your bitch.

Throw up my gang signs.
Yeah you know it's real.
I come from the trap.
Bitch, you know I kill.

I pipe your bitch.
No Stanley Steemer.
Got her Cuming'.
Stanley Screamer.
Wet back.
I call her beaner.
Fucked your girl.
She got the weiner.

Imma' try and spit on it.
If it just came out.
Then I probably done own it.
My flow so smooth.
That these nigga's tryna' clone it.
My plane so new.
That no-one has ever flown it.

You can call me Lazzarus.
By the way I'm popping bands.
Taking shit about me.
No-need to throw hands.
Kill your career.
In front of all my fans.
Getting big despite my haters' motherfucking plans.
