Sissy That Walk Lyrics
by RuPaul.


Pick myself up, turn the world on its head.
Don't forget what, don't forget what my momma said.
People talking , since the beginning of time.
Unless they paying your bills, pay them bitches no mind.

And If I fly or if I fall.
Least I can say I gave it all.
And If I fly or if I fall.
I'm on my way, I'm on my way.

Fly, fly, fly, fly.
Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh x4.
Uh-oh.
Now sissy that walk!

Better beware, ain't no tea ain't no shade.
But at the same time, bitches better get out the way.
I'm a femme queen, Mother of the House of No Shame.
My pussy is on fire, now kiss the flame.

And If I fly or if I fall.
Least I can say, I gave it all.
And If I fly or if I fall.
I'm on my way, I'm on my way.

Fly, fly, fly, fly.
Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh x4.
Uh-oh.
Now sissy that walk!

Breakdown.

And If I fly or if I fall.
Least I can say, I gave it all.
And If I fly or if I fall.
I'm on my way, I'm on my way.

Fly, fly, fly, fly.
Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh x8.
Uh-oh.
Now sissy that walk!
