Rapture Lyrics
by Antonym.

This that rolling happy down the street  .
Patience what a virtue, time'll tick tock then hurt you  .
Uh, Antonym who I be  .
Welcome to the  .
  .
Welcome  .
You'll never find a rapper this great  .
Sorry buddy you're gonna have to put that MP3 right in the trash  .
Interlude  .
And I'm counting all day like the clock on the wall  .
Hit that with a click-clack  .
I got enemies coming like its church on a sunday  .
I keep it more than a hundred  .
  .
Imma keep on rappin til I pull up in that Rari  .
Tomorrow morning sorry mommy  .
And if I don't do nothing Imma ball  .
.
Keep em all on they toes like gymnastics backflips  .
Right on that ass party party  .
Go, go  .
I rap like a muthafucka slap all you muthafuckas  .
Nytra Exposition  .
And I do this for me to but by tomorrow I'll fall  .
Fate, man I do this for ya'll  .
No invitation, I'm an innovation, doctor for the nation  .
  .
Antonym.
.
Thats I make beats, and  .
I will be your guide this afternoon I'll walk you through the exhibition  .
Get your self a curfew, you too late  .
Appall at the gallery, take pictures no flash  .
Doing doughnuts in the road skeet skeet  .
Welcome to the exposition  .
RAPTURE  .
Better get back Imma bounce back unannounced thats  .
And I capture my rapture through this rap shit rap shit  .
And theres two things you gotta learn about me  .
