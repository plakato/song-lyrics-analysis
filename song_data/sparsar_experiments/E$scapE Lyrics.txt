E$scapE Lyrics
by Unique.


The american dream only exists when were asleep.
If this is all a dream please don't wake me up.
Time is ticking, watch me blow up.
If this is all a dream please don't wake me up.
Time is ticking, watch me blow up.
If this is all a dream please don't wake me up.
Please I'm in need of something other than greed, I need an escape.

Conscious in a coma let my mind wonder.
Place me around danger I still try to prosper.
I pray money and fame won't turn me into a monster.
I wake up optimistic walk outside to have my dreams get shot down.
Its like there's something in the air making it impossible to smile.
Its like I'm living in fear waiting for what goes around to come around.
Its like I'm at a lost for words on how to describe the evil I've found.
They say I'm wiser than most at seventeen.
I'm just trying be more than what it seems.
I'm trying display empathy my soul bleeds.
I'm only giving the truth about everything including me.
I'm trying shine light on the things people blind to see.
They'll say this shit is dark.
What they don't realize is, I'm describing a life without dreams.

Its inevitable to escape our fate.
I can't escape reality that's something that I hate.
The american dream only exists when were asleep.
If this is all a dream please don't wake me up.
Time is ticking, watch me blow up.
If this is all a dream please don't wake me up.
Time is ticking, watch me blow up.
If this is all a dream please don't wake me up.
Please I'm in need of something other than greed, I need an escape.

Smoking marijuana let my mind fly.
And land on cloud 9 dear master of disguise.
Your power is divine.
Tight rope and I notice you walk a thin line.
Lets hope lets pray for the dumb deaf and blind.
Lets expose creative control whats on my mind.
Look inside yourself ashes is all you'll find.
It seems we attracted to madness a recipe for disaster.
They look at me and they asking how do you cope with sadness.
They fall in love with money that's a fatal attraction.
They say I'm wiser than most at seventeen.
I'm just trying be more than what it seems.
I'm trying display empathy my soul bleeds.
I'm only giving the truth about everything including me.
I'm trying to shine light on the things people blind to see.
They'll say this shit is dark.
I'm describing a life without dreams.
