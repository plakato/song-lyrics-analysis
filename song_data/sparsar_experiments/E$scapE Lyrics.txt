E$scapE Lyrics

The american dream only exists when were asleep 
If. This is all a dream. Please don't wake me up. 
Time is ticking. Watch me blow up 
If. This is all a dream. Please don't wake me up. 
Time is ticking. Watch me blow up 
If. This is all a dream. Please don't wake me up, 
Please, I'm in need of something other than greed. I need an escape
 
Conscious in a coma. Let my mind wonder: 
Place me around danger. I still try to prosper. 
I pray, money and fame won't turn me into a monster. 
I. Wake up optimistic, walk outside to have my dreams, get shot down, 
Its like there's something in the air, making it impossible to smile 
Its like I'm living in fear waiting for what goes around to come around 
Its like I'm, at a lost for words on how to Describe the evil I've found 
They say I'm wiser than most at seventeen 
I'm, just trying be more than what it seems. 
I'M trying display empathy, my soul bleeds 
I'm. Only giving the truth about everything, including me, 
I'm, trying shine light on the things people blind to see. 
They'Ll say this shit is dark. 
What, they don't realize. Is I'm describing a life without dreams, 
 
Its, inevitable to escape our fate? 
I can't escape reality. That'S something that I hate. 
The american dream only exists when were asleep 
If. This is all a dream. Please don't wake me up. 
Time is ticking. Watch me blow up 
If. This is all a dream. Please don't wake me up. 
Time is ticking. Watch me blow up 
If. This is all a dream. Please don't wake me up, 
Please, I'm in need of something other than greed. I need an escape
 
Smoking marijuana, let my mind fly 
And land on cloud 9. Dear master of disguise, 
Your power is divine, 
Tight rope and I notice you walk a thin line. 
Lets hope lets pray for the dumb, deaf and blind 
Lets expose creative control. Whats on my mind, 
Look inside yourself ashes is all you'll find 
It seems we attracted to madness a recipe for disaster. 
They, look at me and they asking how do you cope with sadness? 
They fall in love with money. That'S a fatal attraction. 
They say I'm wiser than most at seventeen 
I'm, just trying be more than what it seems. 
I'M trying display empathy, my soul bleeds 
I'm. Only giving the truth about everything, including me, 
I'm, trying to shine light on the things people blind to see. 
They'Ll say this shit is dark: 
I'm describing a life without dreams;
