Rap Viper Lyrics
by Wordburglar.


Rap Viper Superbly trained 
To drop dimes on your mind as I'm scanning your brain 
Cobra for Life – my parents met at the Terror-Drome 
Broca Beach Boardwalk that there's my home 
Dad worked at ARBCO mom was a
Tele-viper 
Was flying Rattlers when you
could still smell my diapers 
Lyrical Sniper delivered without obstacle: 
By Dr. Venom at Cobra Island Hospital 
Diabolical. My style's deadly, like Golobulus 
Speakers on my back me and rap, are synonomous. 
Major Bludd got me into writing: poetry, 
Riding Hydrofoils. When the Eels used to flow with me 
And now they know. It'S me. Every single place I go 
Rallying the troops getting played on Cobra Radio 
Sonic Fighter. My Primary Specialty 
Is that I rhyme very freshily 
 
Rap-Viper, Never spit blanks. 
Play me from the FANGS to the BUGGs to the HISSTANKS 
Springfield to the Cobra Citadel 
Rocking shows around the globe and y'know. I give ‘em hell 
 
Now as a Cobra Youth, with my best friend Billy 
Used. To bug Crystal Ball always thought he was silly 
Back when Big Boa taught me how to box 
In between swimming laps with Croc Master's crocs 
I was stealing grape pops from under the dreadnoks 
Getting dirtier than Shadowtracker's dreadlocks 
And when it gets hot and Ammo's bursting 
Just. Throw in my words and chill like Snow Serpents 
Dope serving Like Headman in a drug store, 
Once got busy in the back of a Buzz Boar 
And much more, but that's for another day. 
Don'T need Tomax to know what your brothers say. 
Cobra records put your fams on the roster 
So bump, my jams from your Mamba copters 
With, my Modified standard issue, RTO 
To, let every last snake know where to party yo
