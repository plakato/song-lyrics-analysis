Dreamin' Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.

Twisted Insane.
Then why do I feel like I'm dreamin?
Always surrounded by fiends that wanna bring bloody murder with the 15.

I walk up in the door, how to explain it to his mama when it's seven bullet.
holes up in his dickies?
Smokin' on some mint green, take a hit of weed, Swisher Sweet and my brain is.
always spinnin' when I take a dab.
Take another one and hit the freezer make a pizza with the munchies I'mma.
crunch and now a nigga wanna take a nap.
Cannabis sativa, maybe I'm a fiend, I don't give a fuck I promise you that I.
will never leave her.
Scrapin' all the resin till it's gone cause I'm broke and I don't got enough.
to get another sack I need a re-up.
But I'm off of liquor liter, finna pop the millimeter, finna sit up on the couch and load the bong up.
with my feet up.
Alaskan Thunder Fuck, Obama Kush and the Cheva.
Top off with the wax, the edibles I love to eat up.
Bumpin' the Holistic Choice, they be off of smoking.
Medicated, feeling faded, marination of a mind.
I wake up and I load another bowl up in my pipe.
The only thing that people really go against is time.
Man I be up in the clouds vaporizing with the rest of 'em.
I wanna smoke a bowl with Tommy Chong but they arrested him.
I got to thinking all about the game and I said to them.
And why Eminem ain't never did a track with Tech and 'em.
And why I'm asking questions off of medicine.
I been rapping so long and the people know I can hang with the best of em.

You could to listen to the radio but when is you gon' compromise and realize.
that Twisted Insane's so much better than them.
Then why do I feel like I'm dreamin?

Dreamin of a day when I ain't gotta get so high.
To cope with all your lies, fuck you and your life.
Dreamin of a day when I ain't gotta hit these lines.
This game's killin' my mind, I'm dreamin' all you will die.

King ISO.
I tell a motherfucker Look.
Fuck a medicine I carry heavy.
metal.
When in ghetto and I'm hella frickin' hard.
Load up an AK-47 in the Chevy, ridin' heavy.
Fuck your petty beef, don't ever get involved.
Cause I'm... severin' the head of him who had it.
Cause I'm ready to behead a nigga broad.
I never would'a thought that the devil would'a crawled.
In my head, givin' me thoughts of a rebel with a cause.
Take a trip to 42nd for a second.
Popped the trunk up got the weapon, then it's several, then I toss....
Another body in the cemetery while I'm eating ben and jerry's.
You ?nigga's terret? is really.
off.
Gimme the blunt, nigga wassup? Finna go bust, enemies duck.
Nigga should'a never let me hit the sauce.
Poppin' a pump, poppin' the trunk, gotta be dumped, ?follow me? swamps.
I'm in the slums if niggas ever want a problem.
I get to grippin' a Beretta, catch you slippin' for your cheddar.
Little nigga, it's whatever, fuck the law.
Flip with the Ruger to niggas 'bout to exhibit 'em.
Blew your medulla all over this stereo's on the wall.
Motherfuckers talkin' shit about the Brain.
Like I'm not willin' to go ahead, and leave every nigga sprawled.
I'mma kill it with the rhetoric and all.
Catch a nigga at the red light, I'ma let the 15 off like....
Fuck a diss track, nigga.
Rockin' for 'em and I'm checkin' for you mismatch niggas.
I pull up at your hood bustin' twin gats, nigga.
Turn your Rick Ross beard to a chinstrap, nigga.
It's klick-klack killa, did you get that, nigga?
I'm 'bout to come and murder all you bitch ass niggas.
Your girl in the trunk and your kids at dinner.
Cause ISO is a Brainsyck-ass.
nigga!
BANG.

Dreamin of a day when I ain't gotta get so high.
To cope with all your lies, fuck you and your life.

Now why do I feel like I'm dreamin?....
