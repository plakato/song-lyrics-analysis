Famous Last Words Lyrics
by Word A' Mouth.


Step right up, step right up and listen close.
Fuck the beef and just let the pot roast.
Some shorties try to high post, I block 'em out.
Puff blunts and drink private stocks of stout.
I gots no doubt, so let the flow out my windpipe.
I make ya clap, clap ya hands like Twin Hype.
I keep my stems ripe, puffin' on a peace pipe.
Quick fast like greased light, I'mma recite.
Rhymes re-ignite the mic.
When the beat strikes.
It get me hype when ya punks try to beat-bite.
Tight, lyrics that I write is outta sight.
Like a satellite.
You can't battle right.
Grab the mic tight.
Loose like cellulite.
I can tell you might be the type to bite.
Enormous appetite.
All you rappers bite, unite.
And form like parasite.
And swarm like locusts in the night.
With the focus to bite.
I take flight and rise the farenheit.

Arms locked in combat.
Bombs locked on target.
All block a march? while the flows are bombarded.
Arch rivals stifled by the likes of me and Met'.
Slice ya face and neck.
Place the set, collect, pay your debt.
Place your bet.
Stakes is hijinks, chase.
my jet.
If crazy heads don't make 'em pets.
I'm with the dead.
Got butt-naked snakes and bad fate to take my bread.
I fucked mother nature, made a ten-acre spread.
And ain't break a sweat.
Flowin' like period on the 28th of Mayhem.
I make sense that's worth a pennyweight.
Evacuate, this track'll make you chickenheads ejaculate.
You can't imagine it.
My fire make ya flow evaporate.
Set the date, step to the square.
I scared the record straight.
Defecate in ya mouth and house you like Section 8.
Near the rate.
Of these litigates will leave a better taste in your flow.
So middle aged men, will obliterate.

I could burn ya, I could learn ya.
Somthin' by ya, I could earn ya title.

I could defeat you, beseech you.
To retreat, delete you.

Son I blast you, I smash you.
Point my gat at you, bless You.

I'm the toughest, brag, and puffin' drags.
With eight heads in a duffle bag.

MCs scared to be square.
My style's intimidatin'.
They mimic me, timidly, simulatin' my symmetry.
Claim they innovatin'.
I sin like Satan.
Breaking they flow with flames DISINTIGRATIN'.
When they taking it all in vain.
Main lie generatin'.
Dollars and followers at the same time.
They call my name hollerin' in the Hall of Fame.
I shine like halogen, got it locked with ball and chain.
Ya'll all remain minute.
I dilute, ya potency.
No MC could hold the fate of my future.

One-two, skip to my loo.
This lyric swerve through.
I house you like a curfew.
Curse you.
I hit you off with a hex.
I got more tech than Apex.
That spray necks.
Yo, fuck safe sex.
You get suplexed up in my two-story duplex.
Your rhymes is rejects.
Pulled down like v-necks, yo who next?
I take a ?four?
I stake me all in they heart.
I'm way smart, I went to K-Mart.
And stole a Go Kart.
Went up the flow chart.
When the show start, I cause a ruckus.
With rhymes on like island?
From Nassau to Suffolks.
I stuff chicks, I tuck dicks.
Caught in the mix, It depend.
The dizzy flow will leave you seasick.
Yo frequent.
If I ruled the world my first to free would be Rick.
Hey yo, my rhymes is mad phat.
My mic's bulemic, your style's anemic.
My scenic visions cycle like the one in prisms.
My rhymes is larger than any tiny micro-organisms.
Metaphors has risen over the top.
I kick the ancient bebop.
Pump like a Reebok.
See through my eyes.
Then a peacock.
I leave you as a laughin' stock.
I'm gattin' flocks of MCs.
Who plastic Glocks in they rhyme.
But due time, I reach my true prime.
Deaf like pantomime.
As I chant a rhyme, you can't deny.
My plan to plant your mind inside my pocket.
The lyric pilot keep ya in the cockpit.
I rock shit, I fucking box it.
I'm highly toxic poison.
I make more noise than a block orchestra.
I'm stalkin' ya.
Follow my road I'm forkin' ya.
To the path, so yo.
Tell a friend, tell a foe, Tell a ho.
Tell any fellow.
I do it right like Danny Aiello.
I'm coming at you like a helo-copter.
Chop ya.
Couldn't hold the mic if I spot ya.
