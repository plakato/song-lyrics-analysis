Holla (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

From the land of the valley.
Of the shadow of death.
I take a look at your demise.
And i ferment in the benefits.
Holla if you really wanna problem.
No internet.
Say it to my face and take a minute to finish him.
Welcome to the infamous.
Idiot crime syndicate.
Misses want a kiss.
And get split when the fuckin.
Pistol whip.
Illegitimate villain.
With illnesses in the history.
But his story simplified.
Ain't really gon mean shit to me.
This story takes place.
Years before i took claim.
Back when we were smoking blunts.
And listenin to wu-tang.
I got bored of being.
At the bottom of the food chain.
I picked a fuckin mic up.
And gave myself a new name.
Kill.
Gotta.
Eat.
Got these wack rap faggots on the edge.
Of their seats.
And im so fuckin sketch i wear a.
Ski mask in the sheets.
And im a pimp.
So you know my dicks spittin for free.
Bring ya side dish.
And i could make a dinner for three.
And tho i haven't done it yet.
Im a winner to be.
Yall hot durin summer.
Feel like winter to me.
You think you hotter than oxxy.
You offendin me.
Rippem up and cuttem.
So they momma can't I.D.
You gon' need a lot more.
Than police to find me.
Cause i got anne frank.
And waldo to hide me.
Cause all jokes aside B.
Eat eat.
Gotta.
Kill kill.
Got a line of vigilantes that are.
Ready and will-.
Ing to get the job done.
A 40 and 4G's.
Or E.
Formula for G's.
Satanic orgies.
Cut the baby up and.
Put the pieces in a pentagram.
Then fuck the baby dead mom.
Bumpin teddy pendergrass.
Rap game deadpool.
Dependable to bend ya back.
Bickin back and bein bool.
Or craccin on a caddilac.
Had to laugh at that one.
Holla if you.
Holla if you.
Holla if you want some.
