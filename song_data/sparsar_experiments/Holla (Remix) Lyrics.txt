Holla (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

From the land of the valley, 
Of, the shadow of death 
I take a look at your demise 
And. I ferment in the benefits 
Holla, if you really wan na problem, 
No internet 
Say it to my face and take a minute to finish him. 
Welcome to the infamous 
Idiot crime. Syndicate 
Misses want a kiss 
And get split when the fuckin 
Pistol whip, 
Illegitimate villain, 
With illnesses. In the history 
But his story, simplified 
Ain't, really gon mean shit to me. 
This story takes place 
Years before i took claim 
Back when we were smoking. Blunts 
And listenin to wu-tang 
I got bored of being 
At. The bottom of the food chain, 
I picked a fuckin mic up. 
And gave myself a new name: 
Kill 
 Got ta 
Eat 
Got these wack rap faggots on the edge 
Of their seats, 
And im, so fuckin sketch. I wear a 
Ski mask in the sheets. 
And im a pimp 
So, you know my dicks spittin for free, 
Bring, ya, side, dish 
And. I could make a dinner for three 
And tho. I haven't done it yet 
Im a winner to be 
Yall hot durin summer 
Feel, like winter to me, 
You think you hotter than oxxy 
You offendin me 
Rippem up and cuttem 
So. They momma can't I.D 
You gon' need a lot more 
Than police to find me 
Cause. I got anne frank, 
And waldo to hide me: 
Cause all jokes, aside: B, 
Eat eat 
 Got ta, 
Kill, kill, 
Got, a line of vigilantes that are 
Ready and will- 
Ing to get the job done. 
A 40 and 4G's 
Or E 
Formula for G's 
Satanic orgies 
Cut. The baby up and 
Put the pieces in a pentagram 
Then fuck, the baby dead, mom 
Bumpin, teddy pendergrass 
Rap game, deadpool 
Dependable to bend ya back 
Bickin back and bein bool 
Or craccin on a caddilac 
Had to laugh at that one 
Holla. If you 
Holla, if you 
Holla, if you want some
