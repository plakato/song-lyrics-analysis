His Name Is Robert Paulson Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Mr. President, when I turn 18 I know I can go to war, but that's just obscene!
You want me to fight for the red, white, and blue but I'm not gonna die for.
you! Die a nameless face for a cause by which we're not affected. Blood is.
thicker than oil, by that you stand corrected. I'd think that the leaders of.
the free world would come to a more diplomatic decision. Whoa ohh ohh. Whoa.
ohh ohh  Yeah! . Mr. President, when I turn 18 I know I can go.
to war, but that's just obscene! You want me to fight for the red, white, and.
blue but I'm not gonna die for you! Bombardment of a nation that's full of.
foreign innocence. You made some mistakes, you know, but you let the war.

ohh. Whoa ohh ohh  Yeah!
