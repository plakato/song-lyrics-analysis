Bedrock Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung DSJ.

She got that good good.
She Michael Jackson bad.
I swear she be worth the world and a brand new birkin bag.
Oh yea she poppin tags.
Don't sweat her she ain't on the rag.
She only into men with guts n I got that agrocrag.
N I wear that magnum tag.
A 357 all up in these jeans.
Only got love for my team.
And this cutie wit a booty that look so mean.
Only got one thing so I gotta say this to her.
U should be in love with me stop fuckin with Christopher.
I ain't mean to put him out.
But darlin he just ain't me.
Can't u see that since day one we were always meant to be.
And that be litterly.
Trips setup for italy.
Girl our future lookin bright.
You can't tell what we bout to see.
N I know u bout the sea get wetter than the ocean.
I'm coasting with the potion.
She love that d for the motion.
Promotion I'm goin.
I'm flowin u postin.
U just hit that demotion.
And yo girl asked for that lotion.
So I bang bang no chief keef.
When I'm in the sheets or when I'm on the beats.
N I bust it open either way a treat.
When I'm done she suckin like a leech.
When I'm im done I'm nutting like a squirrel.
To her u a nothin in the world.
To her I'm something like pearls.
And it's funny how u call her baby girl.
I call her once and that's it.
Get the rocket up and blast it.
But I stays with that elastic.
Wrapped up never stuck like a magnet.
Girl u belong in pageants.
N I'm known to make it happen.
No rappin I do this.
I got that wood just like a cabniet.
What's happening it's mr 825.
Gettin live while we on live.
The game was dead I'm the revive.
In Levi's you see I.
Got the dedication like b.i.
N I stay strapped up like t.i.
In the streets in the sheets like oh my.
Got your girl wet I'm bout to take a dive.
Yup.
Call me splash.
I'm in love with that perfect ass.
N I know we haven't did it yet but when we do I won't cum fast.
Yup she got class but I'm not talkin irsc.
She got this certain tude about her that my dream girl just wanna be.
Yo ex man is a wanna be.
He ain't me he boring.
I'm soaring he snoring.
He just talk I be touring.
U adoring cute and gorgeous.
Well groomed clean cut no forest.
I'm tryna get money swear nothing really funny.
I ain't him.
He the poorest.
I'm bout to call a florist.
And order u a bouquet.
And it'll say tonight me and u dinner souffle.
Get it clear like a blue ray.
He yesterday I'm today.
My Jordan's they cool grey.
But wit you I'm Taylor made.
No flavor flav it's my time.
It's my grind it's my rhyme.
And those diamonds that I got you plz don't worry cuz that's your shine.
They online still twitter hate but no mentions.
But if u can't even @ me the hell U should get my attention.
Did I mention she got the works.
Only into yoga pants so no skirts.
When we up in my room it's no shirt.
And we can get a little dirty with no dirt.
And we flirt really all night like everyday And that's no lie.
She's so fly she's so high.
And when she say yea she all mine.
And she's so fine no actin but we makin movies.
I'm the shit u just Doookie that's why I get all the groupies.
She get nasty like a loogi.
But I like it so it's coolie.
And if them bitches think they hot my girl take them to tutti fruity.
Shouts to tune I ain't looney.
Baby girl I'm not your roomie.
I'm just tryna be to man so be my girl and straight up do me.
I get paper that's no loose leaf.
U ain't loosely girl u toned.
DSJ can make that bedrock.
Call me mr flintstone bitch.
