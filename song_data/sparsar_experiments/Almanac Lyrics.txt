Almanac Lyrics
by Volcano Choir.

On the Rio.
Rode the sparrow.
Drank the marrow.
Spayed the clerics.
I spent all day Saturday toasted.
Roasting in your room.

Fall flight.
Skin tight.
Unhinged and it sizzled.

Call backs.
To the almanac.
Tall branches, admissions.

Slow lofty riser.
Slow down baby it'll come.
You're going for a home run.

You can't left with that.
Well you wreck and then you run.

Do a care.

All night.
It's on, right.
So fresh, that it sizzles.

Ball cap.
Almanac.
So dim, it's a riddle.

Small life.
It's on wax.
The bar is cracked as it wasn't enough.

Slow lofty riser.
Well now, slow down baby it'll come, yeah.
Showing for a soft clem.....

Shed skin.
For kin.
We'll all be alive when.
When all of this is over.
When all of us are sober.

Shed skin.
With kin.
I could lead you over.
I'll see you in the clover, darling.

I'll be.
Dancing on your footsteps.
Out near the beach houses.
Out in all the coke houses.

Shed skin.
Like a master.
And the pastor.
Is coming down to the ground.
