Golden age of life Lyrics
by 4hero.

Golden age of life.
Children of the light.
In the garden of your heart and mind.
Golden age of life.
Children of the right time, of the right time.
A newborn babies voice is crying.
A new found love there's no denying.
But the world will teach you hate.
In the mind a brand new stage.
In the garden of your life here is your fate.

backing singers Garden of my mind x6.
Age of life.
Of the mind.
In the garden.
Oo-ooh-ooooh.

Golden age of life.
Children of the light.
In the garden of your heart and mind.
Golden age of life.
Children of the right time, of the right time.
Feeling that there is no tomorrow.
Leaving me thinking of only sorrow.
The world has left me the state.
My mind what is my fate.
It's a place that leaves you filled with so much hate.

backing singers Garden of my mind x12.
Age of life.
Oo-ooh-ooooh.
In the garden.
Age of life.
Of the mind.
Of the light.

backing singers In the garden of my mind x10.
