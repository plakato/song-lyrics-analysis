Before The Fame Lyrics
by ZOOpfish.


And you know it sound so damn good, ZӨӨ music.

And you know it sound so damn good, right right, ZӨӨ music.

This is Olympic village Cassius.
Ain't nobody out sicker, who can match this.
And I don't need a medal, tell me where the cash this.
And when I hit the pedal, ain't nobody catch fish.
You saying he your favorite rapper let me bash him.
I mean lyrically I'm hearing just some trash shit.
Oh he talking hoes talking fashion?
I ain't even got dough and I passed him.

I've been waiting on this shit since I was 12 years.
I was text all the ladies on my cellular phone.
Said I know I'm gonna make it and to hell if I don't.
Now we finally got a taste let's roll, let's roll.
*2.

It seems that.
When I use to dream that.
I'd be where the scene at.
I've seen that.
Was it too extreme? yeah.
But I'll get there and I mean that.
Rock away the team back.
Lean back.
Where the beef at?
We pass.
Steve Nash.
Till you all can see that.
When we rap.
P slaps.
Relapse.
He snaps.
Crackle And pop it.
Partner Patrick ain't stoping.
So you won't be a a problem.
Hear your stereo knocking.

Sorry for the wave.
I said I'm Sorry for the wave.
Sure some of ya'll to blame.
Who with me before the game.
*2.
