Lapse Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Watch the fame spark ignition as I end your whole career.
I ain't do this shit for money boy I do it cause I care.
I take the blade and cut my veins.
Because I fucking hate my life.
I wanna die I got the liquid acid pour it in my eyes.

I'm taking trips on the potent.
I think lifes best when it's frozen.
You see us eat what is stolen.
But never locked in the holding.
I gotta really crazy theory on my life and how it's turning.
Get the gun and now we burning my boy Crackhead bout to burn it GO!

From a town real niggas don't make it.
If you coming down trill niggas don't fake shit.
We gon' run it now lil niggas throw shade.
But when summer come around i'm so cold I feel naked.
So where the fuck is my money at.

I ain't come around to ask your funny ass for anything.
On errythang i'm running like a Pontiac.
And I ain't tripping i'm just dipping in the fishes for my putty back.

I'm wondering if you loving the shits.
Cause you was tugging the grip you son of a bitch.
And if the ice cold melt then i'm Micheal Phelps.
Then I get another hard on when you rubbing the dick.
I get fraud like the motherfucking government is.
Pick up the .38 and dirty it with mugging and then.
I go off so frosty you lost me another nigga fried.
You gone tell me if i'm bugging again.

It's Crackhead.
Yea.
