In These Streets Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


In these streets, thugs bust shots duck cops.
Ride 4's drop tops, or rocks on my block.
Stay focused, keep toting that heat.
Right hand to the man, other hand on my peeps.

Lil' Keke.
Real gutter and grimey, and my hood is riding.
I was born in the city, where the streets are watching.
Them FED's in town, so we dodging devices.
Suffering out here, up and down crack prices.
Weed in the jam, and the drank is slow.
And the last couple months, it's a hundred and fo'.
Bought a new AR, it's getting close to Christmas.
And parole board tripping, so they killing the system.
The block is in pieces, been good to me.
And I still make a move, for some 14-3.
I'm with a click of dope boys, on cruise control.
We just riding through the streets, on snitch patrol.
Rock stars on the hunt, so the track is jumping.
All nighters go-getters, O.G.'s is pumping.
Back to the streets, just to cook that hard up.
Summer time coming, I'ma dress my yard up.

Lil' Keke.
I'ma tear the game up, 'fore they drop my coffin.
Been a thug all my life, this a gangsta talking.
You right, I sleep all day and work nights.
I follow the vision, I see the paper in my sight.
I popped out drop top, it's time for holding.
I'm so-so focused, but picture me rolling.
We all gotta eat, when the price is cheap.
The streets run deep, you either wolf or sheep.
These hustlers getting killed, I got some partnas that died.
They calling it genocide, I'm calling it homicide.
I still ride lonely, keep the heater on me.
Shake your hand eye to eye, peep that you phony.
G's in the Pen, who been sending the kites.
And them boys in the lab, shuffling both of the mics.
I prayed everytime, that a young nigga did it.
As long as I'm free, I got a chance here to get it.

Lil' Keke.
It goes down, for the greens and the bacon.
White Black, Haitian Jamaican.
I'm after Benji's, till they bust my pockets.
I ain't got time to knock it, cause it's all for profit.
I'm walking latitude, while the globe is turning.
And my pen go to tripping, when the kush is burning.
Filet mignon, from a Chimmy Chan wing dinner.
You in the presence, of a real live bread winner.
Boys all star prone, welcome to Texas.
Where boys in the streets, real hungry and desperate.
Still in the mix, and still chasing a buck.
And I never lose the fight, cause I never give up.
I been selling rocks, nigga cast a stone.
You get one shot to shine, when it's on it's on.
Every boy every girl, every woman and man.
I got a million dollar plan, I'm calling it Promise Land.
