Corporate America Lyrics
by Boston.


Who can stop de-evolution of the human race?
Look at you, Corporate America, you're in disgrace.
Globalize; cigarettes, business jets, you love it.
Maximize; but you can take your bottom line and shove it.

Gotta get away.
Gotta get away, but I need a little help tonight.
What 'ya gonna say.
What 'ya gonna say when you never even seen the light.
See the light.

Corporate America, look out, look out.
Corporate America, who's gonna save us, who's gonna save us?

You and I; DVDs, SUVs and cyberspace.
Flying blind, virtual reality is in our face.
This Earth desecrated by the human race.
Now what's it worth? When do we evacuate to outer space?

I see the future in the past.
Just took the corner way too fast, the reckless ride of modern man.
Flattened everything that stands.
Fooled by the sales pitch for progress at a dizzy pace.
We idolize the filthy rich for giving us synthetic taste.
Computer calls, urban sprawl.
Is the world a better place, is the world a better place?

Fare thee well, global extinction's forever.
So what the hell, order your Mercedes in leather.
Veal crates, ozone holes, and toxic waste.
And don't count out religious hate.
Who can survive this man made fate?
