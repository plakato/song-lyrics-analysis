Another Night Out Lyrics
by UNKLE.

Lift the wheels up from the roadway.
Close your sparrow's glassy eyes.
That walk upon the water.
Once more for me.
Are those dead diamonds baby.
Or are they stars gone to sleep.

So low that you might miss me.
Ah yeah.
Slowly fades the light.
So low that you might miss me.
Ah yeah.
Slowly fades the light.

Wait for the Spring.

And to this thing.
I do surrender.
To the darker sin.
I climb with a vine.
On a graveyard train.
Hauling away.
Drowning to die.
Down four fathom five.
To wear the hallowed crown.
To haunt the hollow trees.

What from heaven's tongue is heard.
Through the veins.
Love sustained.
Another night out.

So low that you might miss me.
Slowly fades the light.

Another night out.

Wait for the Spring.

And to this thing.
I give myself.
On a graveyard train.
Pulling away.
Down into heaven.
Down into heaven.
Down into heaven.
? heaven.
To wear the hallowed crown.
To haunt the hollow trees.

To wear the hallowed crown.
To haunt the hollow trees.
