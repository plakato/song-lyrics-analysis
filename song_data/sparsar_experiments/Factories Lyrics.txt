Factories Lyrics
by PUP (band).

I built this life for you
With. My own two hands
You've been sneaking around
You've been with another man

And. I hope you know
Bloody well what you've done to me
When. I come home
From. The factory

I'll make a plan
Baby, you know
I'm a jealous man
And. What goes around comes. Around
You took the car
Said you're, leaving town

We can play hide and go seek
But baby, I'm playing for keeps
And down by the Don Valley. Creek
The water is dirty and deep
Leave you under the overpass
With, the broken glass
By, the factories

Far as I'm concerned
You, had it all
And you'll get what you deserve
Cause. What goes around comes around
And I'll slip, away
Without a sound

And. They will track me through the night
And in the dawn
Oh. They'Ll. Hang me for what I have done

Baby. It'S alright
I will be seeing you soon
When the floor of the gallows
Drops away. I will think of you

Baby. It'S alright
I will be seeing you soon
When the floor of the gallows
Drops away. I will think of you

When. There'S nothing left to lose
Shave my hair and shine. My shoes
Hanging from the noose
Any last words
Better say it. Now
I guess I was right
What goes around comes around
