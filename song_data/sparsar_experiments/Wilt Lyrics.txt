Wilt Lyrics
by Rune.

Withering away....
The colors fade into one.
The turning of the tides.
To pass from old to new.
Kneeling before the sun.
And seeking forgiveness.
No shelter from these piercing rays.
That blister my skin.
Scarring the flesh.

Begging for night- for an end.
To the suffering.
Covering the sun.
In a darkened embrace.
Unable to crawl of from these depths.
I have sank.

Intentions grow weak-.
Ambitions begin to fade.
Searching for closure.

Within the reach of another existence.
One day this nightmare will end.
Leaving this life's perils behind.
Withering away.
