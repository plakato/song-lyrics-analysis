Riding the Storm Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Breaking the waves, a ride on the wild raging sea.
Playing with fortune, oh, what a lust to be free.
Flashlights and thunder, the prattering rain on the hull.
From a stormy horison we get our course.
The cry of freedom.

Face in the wind, we're riding the storm.
We'll stay our course whatever will come.
Wandering souls in the sea of the damned.
Death or glory, oh, oh, we're riding the storm.

Cracks in the planks, the rigging moves upwards and DOWN.
Staggering masts, the pounding splash of the prow.
The wind in our sails, our flag flies high on the top.
From a stormy horizon we get our course.
The cry of freedom.

Face in the wind, we're riding the storm.
We'll stay our course whatever will come.
Wandering souls in the sea of the damned.
Death or glory, oh, oh, we're riding the storm.
