Dawn of Ages Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

Begin our journey back through mists of time.
As we arrive at the dawn of mankind.
Engulfed in hatred, the world is at war.
A sword is made to bring peace evermore.

Created by the nobles one.
Raised by champions, Great Defender.
Assailed by ravenous fury.
Conquered and eclipsed by evil splendor.

Now man he cowers in fear and in shame.
It holds a power which can not be named.
What once held virtue is wicked instead.
And none can hinder it's thirst for the dead.

Over the mountains and the trees.
Through valleys and the seas.
We stand united on the plain.
Mount up the barricade, or meet the end.
Against an army of us all.
There is no chance we'll fall, hear the call.

Through smoke and ashes stands one mortal man.
Alone triumphant, the sword in his hand.
The worlds destruction at last is complete.
