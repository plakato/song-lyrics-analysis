Herbalz in Your Mouth Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

Don't drink the milk  IT'S SPOILED!

Pete Nice.
Eyes slow to open, alarm clock's broken.
I'm steppin out the bed but ain't a booty line spoken.
Stick a 40 to my lips, I sips and I guzzle.
A 40-dog Breakfast of Champs it ain't a puzzle.
Grips on my feet and step out my rest.
I meet MC Dope Incredible and DJ Fresh.
They got a demo; fiendin for my headphones.
So I throw it my system but it's so-so.
I said, The weebles wobble, but I dabble in verbals.
The movies that you're makin get the herbalz.
This ain't a Prince Paul loop from The Turtles.
It's just 3rd Bass givin y'all the herbalz.

Herbalz in your mouth.
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth.
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth.
Serch Hold up! Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down.
Herbalz in your mouth.
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth.
From the North and to the South.
Serch Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down.

MC Serch.
Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down.
But them herbalz, they bobble and you see them all around.
Them 501 blues can't hide the red apple.
When I'm in a bodega, buyin some Snapple Orange Iced-Tea.
Skins are playin nicety behind me.
Scatterbrain no-name do you mind G?
Spot the profile and slips in the Serch zone.
And wants a description of the bone -- hold up.
Wants a description of the bone?!
Play AT&amp;T and check the three on your telephone.
D-E-F, then I left to break South.
And left a herbal in her mouth.

Herbalz in your mouth.
Herbalz in your mouth.
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth.
Serch Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down!
Herbalz in your mouth.
3rd Bass givin herbalz in the mouth.
Herbalz in the mouth.
Serch Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down!

MC Serch + {DJ Richie Rich scratching}.
Herbalz.. HERBALZ! Ha ha ha.
Herbalz...

Serch Weebles to the weebles to the wobbles - to the herbalz.
Nice I don't drink milk when it curdles.
Serch Cause then it's too pasty, French like pastry.
Nice It's like gettin caught boostin at Macy's.
Serch True indeed, Cogswell Cogs, and Sprockets at Spacely's.
Nice I make like George, and Jet-i-son safely.
Serch to my rest and not a Tribe but I'm Quest'n.
You got bad breath, then take a Certs with Retsin.
Dribble dribble drabble say what, I beg your pardon.
Quincy ain't convinced me, got my own Secret Gardens.
Nice So now we boomin out the speakers and amps.
Buggin your nuts like the PMS cramps.
Some falsified but I gots bones to pick.
The only nine you ever seen was in arithmetic.
Herbalz given, how you livin?
Serch Yo I ain't played like a pseudo.
Nice Herbalz in your mouth, and mine are macanudo.

Herbalz in your mouth.
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth.
Say herbalz in your mouth.
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth.
A from the North, to the South.
Everybody say HERBALZ IN YOUR MOUTH.

MC Serch.
Got the herbalz in your mouth.
Pete Nice! No herbalz, in his mouth.
Richie Rich! No herbalz, in his mouth.
Prince Paul, no herbalz in his mouth.
Yes, yes man.
Got herbalz, where they at?
Got herbalz...
Herbalz in your mouth yo where they at they in your mouth.
Herbalz in your mouth yo where they at they in your mouth.
Herbalz in your mouth yo where they at they in your mouth.
Mouth mouth mouth, m-mouth, m-mouth...

But I see some skins, they got herbalz in their mouth.
You need to break out, if you got herbalz in your mouth.
Come now son, you got herbalz in your mouth.
The her, the her herbal her ah erbalz.
You got the her her the her the herbalz in your miggy-miggy-mouth.
Da mouth, HOW MANY HERBALZ IS THAT?
You got herbalz in your m, da miggy-miggy-mouth.
