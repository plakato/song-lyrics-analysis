Jello and Juggernauts Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

Looks like a bag of cheetos exploded.
They don't wear plate armor just to stand twenty paces away.

Fears and judgements I'll never understand.
Jello and Juggernauts quicken my heavy hand.

When is the pen mightier than the sword.
Are you ambitious for getting up off the floor?

Fears and judgements I'll never understand.
Jello and Juggernauts quicken my heavy hand.
