How I Feel Lyrics
by Tyler Cassidy.


Can't feel a thing, can't even feel pain.
Somebody help me out.
You just got, gotta tell me why.

It's heavy, I feel it slipping through my fingers.
The smoke from the shot in my past life lingers.
I'm calling but I think the world is turning off the ringers.
Oh well I'll leave a voicemail I turn it on to speaker.
I'm checking out it's kinda hard what's this about?
Middle finger to the sky, when we try to call him out.
If I can make him mad enough then maybe he'll just show up.
Then I don't got to pull this trigger, he'll just make me blow up.
Wish I could say that I was nervous, I don't feel a thing.
Been waiting 8 years for the big bang and blood stains.
I've seen enough rain and suffering and hustling.
I'm not saying I'm not sane but I think I'm not sane.
In just a couple of seconds right before the shot rings.
I get to see an image of my life where there is not rain.
I get to see a vision of my life where there is not pain.
And not shame, so I lay down the gun and run the life lane.

Millions of people.
Know just how I feel.

I look in the mirror at the face of adversity.
In the eyes of the person I hate, who doesn't quit hurting me.
You're my own worst enemy, you're grinning me.
Don't wanna see me fly up out that city, bring my kin with me.
But now I'm hungry, I'll make the world hate how much they love me.
Coming from the underground, slummed up and grubby.
Waiting for you fat cats to keep on getting chubby.
Keep up filling up that tummy, yummy, yummy , yummy , yummy.
And imma eat you all up in one bite, my life.
Yeah imma knock you all out with one strike, my life.
Yeah imma cut you all down with one knife, my life.
My pain, my strife, my life, all right?
See me in the street when you pass me in your benzes.
On the sidewalk waiting outside of your fences.
Up your driveway past your 20 inch rims'.
And beating on the door till it's bouncing off the hinges.

Thank you, everyone who's standing in my way.
You're the light that keeps me up at night, the darkness in my day.
You're the garbage in my garden, you're the reason that I'm hardened.
I'm a rock inside a shell, I've been through hell now I'm a Spartan.
I'm good ol' uncle sam, I'll look you in your eyes.
I want more than just to hear your cries I want your demise.
I want you  on this rope, God I hope I break through.
I want your head and your heart and your hopes and your dreams.
Everything you want, everything you want from me.
You're my curse, you're my hearse.
You're my death, you're my birth.
You're everything I can't control, everything that hurts.
I'm your nightmare man, almost right there man.
What's another year? Been at this for a light year man.
I'm the winner at the finish line, no matter how you try.
Because the difference between you and I is I'm ready to die.
