Life is a Struggle and Pain Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


Life is a struggle and pain, I can't see the.
Sunny days 'fore the rain, G-O-D please.
Help me to maintain, because I don't.
Wanna die, if I'm living in vein.

Cl'Che.
Sometimes I just wanna scream.
But I know, G-O-D will make it right for me.
When I feel like I can't take no more, of these rugged streets.
I let him take over, now my mind is free from worries.
So many negatives, I can't fall.
Got my cheese, and Pac's are posted on my wall.
If I make any more mistakes, I can now learn from em all.
Cause I'm grown now I found him, so you know I'm strong now.
I write my songs, with plenty of pride.
For my people, that done burned for years and died.
Don't you wanna grow over your child, so you can know who you are.
Instead of putting the world on pause, just to drive that fancy car.
Hey boy, I want you to feel me now.
Cl'Che know you got it pain, won't love you anyhow.
Need you to help that little sister you know, build some esteem.
You wanna know what's on her mind, and not in her jeans.
Let's make this world a better place, for the living.
Let's make our minds a better place, for thinking and listening.
My people, let's try to make a change.
Cause I don't wanna die, if I'm living in vein.

Z-Ro.
Even with God in my life, it's still hard in my life.
Motherfuckers call it so close, to be fraud in my life.
And I can't understand, Z-Ro ain't doing no wrong.
That's probably why they be fucking with me, thinking I'm all song.
But it's all gravy you wanna hate me, then go on hate me.
Cause I've been looking for reasons, to take it off safety.
And a motherfucker don't make me for me, lay me feeling on me.
Like nobody don't really want me, the pressure creeping up on me.
I wonder what happy is, cause I've never known it.
People I meet ain't partnas, they potential opponents.
Cloudy days, and the place I come from running from cops.
Put it down in the alley way, when they pass I'm busting some shots.
Sorry God, I know I ain't got no business selling dope and tripping God.
Show me some inspiration, when you see me slipping God.
Cause when I die, I don't want it to be in vein.
I'd rather serve in heaven, won't be in the Penn in the flame.

Cl'Che.
Know you can go anywhere you wanna go.
You can be, anything you wanna be.
You can see, anything you wanna see.
If you keep G-O-D, first everyday.
And it hurts, the daily living while you flipping.
Through your hood, with your partnas kicking.
Click tripping, don't know why he had a short living.
You don't know, yeah you know.
He ain't the first, oh how the truth hurts.

Z-Ro.
So I'mma go, where I wanna go.
And if I'm pressing for a fo', that's what I'm gonna blow.
Long as my bills paid and my rent paid, it's all gravy.
Cause when I was on this, ain't nan one of my people saved me.
Life is a struggle and a pain, but I'm maintaining.
I pray I won't get found naked, with my brains hanging.
Too many niggas, trying to get me for my paper stack.
So I'mma be bout a playa, now where the haters at.
