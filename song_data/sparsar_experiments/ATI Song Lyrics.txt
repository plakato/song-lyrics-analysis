ATI Song Lyrics
by Ruslan.


I'm studying all day, I'm studying all night.
Excellent grades, ain't no absent marks.
Alright!
Alright! Show me what you got.
Work hard every day, many sleepless nights.
The fruits of my labor - call it fast life.
Fast life!
Fast life! You should better try.

Welcome to the ATI, that's the future's paradise.
The residence of parasites, never look for a compromise.
Yeah we cook every day, I guess you got appetite.
Cause we're eating any books, call it papers' genocide.
Mind over matter, study over everything.
All eyes are settled, but sizzling like gasoline.
Thoughts on the future places we have never been.
If you feel me then you gotta take my useful recipe.
Just say i can do it and do what you can.
Close your eyes, you can feel it, stop to complain.
The unique university gives you opportunities.
To get a job, to see the world for rookies like you and me.
See? And don't think that our castle is too small.
Because a little body often harbors a great soul.
And don't think we're talking nonsense that reckless.
Because little pigeons can carry great messages.

Welcome to the ATI, that's the future's paradise.
The residence of parasites, never look for a compromise.
Others on the other side, watching us just get too high.
Could be better if you would take my words of advice.
Graduate and take exams then join us and feel the glory.
Seems it's hard to study there, I know it's pretty pretty boring.
Like you joined navy, army, like the soup you're so abhorring.
“Hard work equals Fast life”: be in this category.
Go ahead, go abroad! Let others envy, hate on you.
Take a chance and work in Hilton, accommodations are waiting for you.
Carry on to carry out into practice in Marriott.
Both get pleasure you can't measure and a big, full of money pot.
Now tell me how you like it, while I'm still putting commas.
You better wonder, I ain't even talking double-diploma.
Join there, this song is brochure, going like propaganda.
Feel the difficulties that you have never ever handled.

Welcome to the ATI, that's the future's paradise.
The residence of parasites, never look for a compromise.
I don't know how to summarize, no flight, no land, but we're still fly.
We're rolling dice, and dean is nice, CEO is nice, I rhymed it twice.
I'm still on the same beat. “You better be fast” - that's the only thing they.
never asking me.
I show you the massive hit, the varsity like it, and I guess it's gonna be the.
blasting thing.
ATI - everlasting thing, all the students pasted-in.
The nasty capacity cast a vast glance at it, and masters are blasted, they.
glance at advance in it.
Masks on the faces, we step on the gas, that's the castle's rapacity for.
ashing and smashing them.
We bash education and passion is splashing, I guess that's the best thing we.
pass all the tasks and.
Now just tell me how you feel, assess the hard thing we make for free.
Tourists aka volunteers, willy-nilly we're the best team.
YEAH! That's our anthem, look so crazy - Marilyn Manson.
We make history, take a seat in the hansom of the students that so handsome.
So you look at the bestest guys never look for compromise.
You're welcome to the ATI, that's the future's paradise.

All day, all night.
Hark Work – Fast Life!
Fast Life!
Yeah!
