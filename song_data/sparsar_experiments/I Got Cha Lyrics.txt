I Got Cha Lyrics
by Queen Pen.

Riley Big Dave, come in.
Big Dave Yo, go 'head.
Riley What's your twenty?
Big Dave I'm in front of the A room right now.
Riley Ten four.
Big Dave I got cha.
Riley She's on her way to the back.
Big Dave I got cha.
Riley Don't let nobody fuck with her.
Big Dave I got cha.
Riley She got a lot to say, aight?
Big Dave I got cha  I got cha.

Queen Pen.
Step back bitch, better take notes.
Teddy got too much dough for me to ever go broke.
I'm callin your bluff, what you.
ever tote?
I'm raw and uncut like Columbian coke.
Now how many of y'all wanna fuck with me?
Trick question, who wants to fuck with Queen?
While y'all role play, I'm always mean.
And before Soundscan, I'm ate by the streets.
You - you real funny to me.
Like a drag queen with heels and a head full of.
Weave.
Talkin about ki's, that you never seen.
Rappin about gats, that you never packed.
I'm da, original don dadda.
And I say this to your face it'll take a whole lotta.
For you, to catch up to my speed.
Fuck your icey rings  fuck this industry.
Take away the shine, you still a chicken wing.
Bum bitch! Yeah, I said it!
Bum bitch! And I never will regret it.
).

Don't bring them bitches around me.
Don't bring sand to the beach.
Pump QP in the Jeeps.
We beez the baddest in the streets.
It's my time, to shine.
Those styles, y'all kicked, was mine.
Don't let me catch y'all tricks this time.
Take away your right to spit a rhyme!

I got a, chip on my shoulder and shit on my chest.
I took a little break and bitches got overconfident.
On the really girl, you don't want no conflict.
Save your slick talk for Saturday night's at plex.
QP is back, what did y'all expect?
That I stay pregnant forever, and live off of my publishing cheques?
All this bad chat got me kind of vexed.
Y'all been talkin about me ever since I fucked that nigga from Next.
It's all over, I'm shuttin y'all down.
By the end of the first quarter, y'all gone be sayin, Damn she foul.
Dead, QP ain't playin around.
She goin hardcore on y'all bitches dis round.

Riley Big Dave, come in.
Big Dave Yo, go 'head.
Riley What's your twenty?
Big Dave I'm in front of the A room right now.
Riley Ten four.
Riley She's on her way to the back.
Big Dave I got cha.
Riley Don't let nobody fuck with her.
Big Dave I got cha.
Teddy Riley She got a lot to say, aight?
Big Dave I got cha  I got cha.
