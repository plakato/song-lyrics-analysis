Affirmation Of Ascension Lyrics
by Volumes.

Maintain a perfect picture for a perfect time.
Everyone was guided towards the truth.
The message of the entire world would rest on the back of me.
In the end of it all, it comes down to one or two things.
And if you got money, then I got money.
Why would you take credit for what you didn't create?
The mission of three hundred solid.

We will be given wings.
Explosions in the sunset.
Igniting in my mindset.
Just follow me into the clouds.
Where we lay all of our secrets down.
Drop to my knees.
While we were given freedom.
Never have I gone this far with any help.
An honest approach to living.
And learning about myself.
Well goodbye for now.
I'm chasing it down.

I've worked so hard to make this moment mine.
You will hear my voice above the rest.
You'll watch me shine.

Reminiscing of the days.
Where you used to be someone.
A shining spectacle.
so far from reach.
Decades later we had encountered.
A final time.
I walk in silence passing by.
Like a diamond.
Like there is no one left.
With money to be made.
Quit lying to yourself and make the move.

Let's get one thing straight man.
Yeah you're filthy fucking rich right?
Let's get one thing straight man.
All my life I've been trying to make money mean something to me.

I've worked so hard to make this moment mine.
You will hear my voice above the rest.
You'll watch me shine.
