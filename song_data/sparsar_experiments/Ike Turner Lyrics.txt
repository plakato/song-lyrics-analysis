Ike Turner Lyrics
by Queen Kwong.

You got a small dick.
You got some gremlin teeth.

You are nothing.
You are nothing.

You think you're rock 'n' roll.
You are just looking old.
You think you're jesus.
You got a small penis.

You are nothing.
You are nothing.

You may have broke my face.
But I know I broke your heart.

You are nothing.
You are nothing.

You think you made me.
Just cause you named me.

You are nothing.
You are nothing.
