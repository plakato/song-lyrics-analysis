All Star Freestyle (Bonus Track) Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


Hahahahaha.
Ruff Ryder 3.
Time for the younger generation to blow.
You know I brought my nigga with me...
D-Block.

Aiyyo, it's Jae Hood, bitch, respect my bars.
The doctors have to piece together your face like a collage.
Niggas always talk greasy till the steel come out.
And slugs rip through they gums and their grill come out.
Motherfuck you and fuck your mans.
If I don't clap you in the dome.
I'mma leave clips in your diaphragm.
I'm the hood prophet, puff purple instead of chocolate.
Stay from around chumps and cowards cause they gossip.
And I'mma stay on the corner like stop signs.
With a pack of them creamy colored rocks and the Glock 9.
When you speaking of the hardest, nigga.
Bring Hood name up.
D-Block bitch -- we about to have the game chained up.
My words too strong, bars too powerful.
And your towel can't dry you when them dumdums shower you.
Y'all mad cuz y'all garbage and your lyrics is boring.
And your whip was made the same year that you was born in.

Listen man; don't worry bout how many gats this crook has...
Just know I stay strapped like book bags.

You just getting off your porch.
And me? I'm just getting off in court.
I could make sure your coffin bought.
Why would you mention a burner?
It's a difference between rappin and attempting a murder.
Talking the shit you living and the shit you heard of.
You said fuck Larsiny?
What is you crazy, bitch?
Before you walk the streets, here's a few safety tips.
Watch who you speaking bout, and watch who you speakin to.
The cats you speak about'a show you what the heat could do.
A respirator is What you'll be breathing through.
And you got beef with who that you need toast?
The closest you came to beef, was meatloaf.
When we post, with bats and P-coats.
Y'all niggas better be ghost.

Yo, to fuck with Keem, y'all bitches better hope and dream.
Every gun that I own got a scope and beam.
When I a-pproach the scene, shake dice, rope ya team.
Best bitch on the East coast since Queen.
Latifah, buy reefer, fly diva.
Ride deeper, four-pound thump louder than five speakers.
Spit fire, hot lava flow.
Don't get twisted, not one of them Prada hoes.
Catch me in Escada clothes, with a lot of dough.
That's not mines -- it's his...
I need a lot more to live.
You gotta give to Keem before your kids.
How you think a bitch like me afford to live motherfucker?

Interlude: Styles P.
Hahahahahaha.
That's a bad bitch.. Shiz you a bad ass nigga.
It's the younger generation..Killing y'all....
Lott... Get busy on these niggas.

Hey look, I'm trying to stack mad gravy.
So I get birds from my crew, and make Erykah Badu my Bag Lady.
You that crazy? Squeeze! I know you ain't spittin shells.
Your hand shake so much, it shows up on the Richter scale.
I made the huskiest niggas look like they had sickle cell...
I don't just sell bricks dog, I got a bitch for sale.
So let me find out there's a nigga hatin' Lott.
No coffin, he get buried in a refrigerator box.
God damn, I'm a hot man.
I'm tellin you straight up, I got my weight up.
Jacob, call my wrists Roxanne.
Cuz if I wore it in a dark room?
You and your man'a hate it, I'mma look animated like a cartoon.
Bottom line, I'm telling you that you ain't fuckin wit me.
Hard, no body guards; you want a shot? Come and get me.
I'm not a sucker, nor any nigga runnin wit me.
And why y'all ballin on wheels, if they under fifty... nigga?

Lockin blocks the motto.
Got more slow than Dr. Zhivago.
Same mind state that made Capone boss of Chicago.
But I don't get my gangster from movies, I'm a Rockstar.
5-star teles runnin gangstas on groupies.
Come through and leave a boy sick.
Cause my F-Type steers with a joystick.
I'm the heart in my era.
Listen, I lead a artistic life.
Paint pictures with my actions, ain't no margin for error.
My innate features, leave niggas dismayed speechless.
And please don't mistake weakness for kindness.
I fuck with old timers.
So don't make me forget that you real and catch Alzheimer's.
Motherfuckin hoes, never I'll spoil them.
I'm known to break a bitch for reckless eyeballin.
The top, dog; nigga, I'm the bare truth.
You want to get math?
Well, nigga, I'm the square root.
The Rockstar.

I got a mean stash, you seen Cass get his thug on.
And strip my bitch; we kiss, and get our hug on.
She what I put drugs on to get my grub on.
And dog, when you park your car? Put your Club on!
The next cat I put the snub on?
I'm a clap the gat till it get too hot, and that's wit gloves on!
Y'all love drawin, y'all should go to a art school.
I get my club on with the glow-in-the-dark jewels.
Trees on my shoes, Polo and the dark blues.
And I spark tools that the po and the narcs use.
Fuck, is y'all stupid or somethin?
What's the point in, pullin out your joint if you ain't shootin at nothin?
Dude, frontin get you banged in the face...
And if you have braces, then you know how the banger'a taste.
I'm wit anything pertainin to cake.
And I just copped the blue Lottman.
With the rectangular face... Easy.

Interlude: Styles P.
Easy niggas.. matter of fact... fuck that, go hard...
Cass', show these niggas how you built...
Grab your guns, bust off.. my nigga.

Yeah it's Cassidy bitch, get the name clear.
I'm what you lames fear, got the game scared.
I buy 'caine by the square, but sell it by the O.
I run through snow like a reindeer.
The coke heads nose red like Rudolph.
I grind on the strip so hard, I got blue balls.
I'd rather knock a Q off, then get blew off.
That's how I stay on my toes like my shoes off.
You dudes soft, really bitches like RuPaul.
When's it's war, I move out like U-Hauls.
I'm a true boss...
I send 8 balls to the corner.
My strip like a pool hall.
And I ball like I been in the sport.
My trigger finger itchin like it got genital warts.
Don't play around wit him, boy.
Cause Cass is a pain in the ass like hemorrhoids.
Faggot!

Yeah yeah... it don't stop.
This is R3, young generation.
Showin y'all cocksuckers what it's about.
When y'all get some young boys come talk to me.
We could do it any time any place; you know our style.
Get ready for R4, cuz we never stop, we still in the studio.
We in the studio right now.
Far as Holiday Styles goes, the Ghost, S.P., Paniro.
Well, you know... I'll be out soon.
A Gangster &amp; A Gentleman, at a store near you.
Cocksucker.
If you find somebody who could do it better.

Cuz you know, that's a gentleman thing to do.
Then I'mma flip to the gangster and shoot him in the head.
Cuz that's just my style.
You know... my shit'a be the hardest shit on the planet.
As a matter fact, followin this.
So, I suggest y'all stay tuned to Ruff Ryders cuz we will not stop.
There's a lot of cocksuckers in this industry and game but...
There's a lot of cocksuckers outside in the street, too.
If you on the street... Don't Snitch.
