3 Way Relationship Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


Say cuz like this here, I'mma stay strapped nigga.
I'mma keep me bitch nigga, ya understand me believe that.
She loves a nigga, real talk nigga.
Make way for a motherfucking gangsta, loc'd up G'd up.
At all motherfucking times homeboy, real talk.
Get it how you live jack,.

Z-Ro.
I got a gangsta chick, and a classy lady.
I can't decide which one I wanna be with, it's driving me crazy.
The one that's good, want me out of the hood.
But the other one be bugging, giving me reasons to keep on thugging.
One of my women got big ass breast-s, and wide hips.
The other one is a 40, with a thirty round clip.
She the reason I'm still breathing, y'all know what it is.
Yeah I love her, but she can't give me kids.
And she can't run my bath water for me, or roll me a cigarillo.
Ain't no sex either, she just gon' lay under the pillow.
But it's still a threesome, cause my other lil' mama be in the bed too.
Doing everythang, sexy black gon' do.
But black ain't able, to catch an attitude with me.
Over nonsense, baby argue and act a fool with me.
I need to make a decision, but when.
Cause all I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.

I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose.
Either way I win, but I still lose heeey.

I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose.
Walking in a regular man's, or a gangsta's shoes heey.

She can't do it to you like this, she can't give it to you like that.
She can't even let you, hit it from the back.
I'm the reason you can breath easy, I'm the reason everybody fear you.
The bitch that won't let trouble come near you.
I'm the one you can lean on, when times get hard.
The one that's trying to bring you closer to God.
Yeah but when it get gangsta, all she gon' do is run and hide.
I'mma hold you down baby, just finger me and watch em all die.
Z-Ro.
Stuck between affection, and protection.
My woman and my weapon, this situation's got me stressing.
Yeah I'm a Hoover gangsta crip, but I'm a man first.
Even still I find myself fingering sexy black, until my hand hurts.
Dumping on my enemies, to save my life.
With intentions, on getting laid tonight.
So I guess in the end, all I need in this life of sin.
Is me, and both of my girlfriends.

I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose.
Either way I win, but I still lose heeey.

I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose.
Walking in a regular man's, or a gangsta's shoes heey.

Z-Ro.
Sexy black listen, if the police get you and me then I'll end up in prison.
Five years minimum, what they giving.
That's the reason why I chuck you out the window, when they pull up on my rear.
Come back and scoop you later, when the coast is clear.
And baby girl, you already know how I feel about you.
Can't picture myself, living without you.
But in this bidness I'm in, it's do or die that's why.
I keep my gangsta bitch at my side, when I ride is you feeling me.
Would you rather picture someone killing me.
Three shots to the dome, have you wondering why I ain't came home.
For me sexy black is necissary, like commissary when I'm in jail.
Cause murderers and jackers, be giving me hell.
So fuck it, let's have a menizzle twizzle.
One of y'all on my left one of y'all on my right, and me in the middle.
Something beautiful is about to begin, cause all I need in this life of sin.
Is me, and both of my girlfriends.

I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose.
Either way I win, but I still lose heeey.

I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose.
Walking in a regular man's, or a gangsta's shoes heey.

Me and both of my girlfriends....
