Gotz 2 be a G Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Yeah, we back nigga.
Lil' Flipper, Yung Ro, Chamillionaire.
This how it go, ha-ha.
We still doing this mixtape shit nigga.
Yeah uh, B.G. Duke up in this bitch, look.

Lil' Flip.
I'ma be a G, until the day that I die.
Everyday you see me, nigga I'll be high.
I'm smoking on that hays, use to smoke on that regular.
Now niggas mad, I'm a hitter the competitors.
On another level, yellow rocks all in my fucking bezel.
Nigga they causing trouble, you wan' tangle with the devil.
I'm rolling with my Glocks, I ain't fucking with the cops.
But I'm busting fucking shots, cause they don't give me props.
They know me on the East, they know me on the West.
Even when I'm in my hood, I still gotta wear my vest.
Niggas they wanna test, cause they album was a mess.
But when I step out I go to the club, they hoes impressed.
They like the way I dress, and they like the shoes I buy.
They know everytime they see Flip, he gon be fly.
Got the Mikey D's jersey, got my name on the back.
Even they caught cases, we got caine in the Lac.
We gon hustle till we broke, we ain't broke because we hustle.
Niggas claim they in they in the streets, but they know I got that muscle.
But a nigga use to struggle, now a nigga doing good.
I'm like the Diplomats, what's really good hood.

Got to be a G, to the day that I die.
Got to be a G, to the day that I die.
All my boys real, to the day that I die.
Got to be a G, to the day that I die.
Got to be a G, to the day that I die.
All my boys real, to the day that I die.
All them boys real, I'm a G.
All them boys real, I'm a G.

Yung Ro.
It feel good to be me, because I shine everyday.
Wake up and then I pray, and thank the Lord for this day.
A new day means hope, another chance to get it.
I got the mind of a G, so I plan to get it.
Plan to split it, divide it where it's 'spose to go.
Stack it up and share with the ones, close to Ro.
That's how it's 'spose to go, well at least I speak for me.
But if you feel me nod your head, cause I also speak for G's.
Real niggas who want hundred, playas guys and gent's.
And we a dying breed, think it's like five percent.
I's a pimp, on ro-do and mind's a scent.
From a place under water, so my eyes are squinched.
But nevermind that, just pour me up two cups of liquor.
Jump down so you could sip a, skeet taste with Koopa and Flipper.
And your boy Yung Ro, teach you how to fold bread.
To my niggas on lock, stay smart hold your head.
I'm rolling heads, while rolling red down the block.
Trunk unlock trunk pop, trunk knock cock stop.
Drop bops flop, looking at me while I do my thang.
Switching lanes holding grain, pushing caine hold up mayn.
I'm a G peep my style, how I called it how I feel.
Mack P, Koopa, Flip, Twin all them boys real.
And all them boys feel, yeah the same way as me.
Real recognize real, I swear to you I'm a G.

Ha, real recognize real I swear to you I'm a G.

Lil' Flip.
I'm the realest of the real, I'm the trillest of the trill.
Nigga fuck around with me, I'ma have to show the steel.
I'ma have to show my skills, let these bitch niggas know.
That these snitch niggas know, Lil' Flip run the show.
You can open up for me, nigga I'm the headliner.
Fuck around with niggas, who always get vagina.
You tricking your do', we never licking em low.
Nigga you rolling and picking, nigga I'm picking them hoes.
We got bitches on every coast, bitches in every state.
Niggas talk shit, but they gon up on Ricki Lake.
Broke rapper no deal, no skills stay broke.
Mo'fuckers smoking regular weed, we got that good dro.
I'm a fucking hood nigga, bad nigga good nigga.
AK-47, chopper made of wood nigga.
It's understood nigga, we ride candy nigga.
In every state, all these niggas wanna ban me nigga.
I got they bitches number, in my phone yeah bitch.
You know I got a fucking story, I'ma tell bitch.
I got a brick to sell, I got a click in jail.
And when they get out, I got them niggas getting my mail.
Tipping the scales, we above the law.
Like Steven Segal, niggas fake like Ru Paul.
The way that I ball, the dro that I buy it's the best shit.
I never step out the house, without my vest bitch.
I got my Glock on my lap, got my mind on my money.
Got these bitch niggas broke rappers, trying to fuck with Johnny.
But they can't, get the pink rocks yellow rocks.
Blue rocks, niggas do shows and fuck with the cops.
But I ain't doing that shit, I got my own team.
Oh you going away, bitch I'm the home team.
I got my own shit, I got my own click.
I know I fucked your gal, yep I got my own bitch.
I'm just a playa like Hef, I'm just jazzy like Jeff.
I got stripes like the ref, these nigga lie but they deaf.
They can't hear what I'm saying, these niggas think that I'm playing.
Now their bodies decaying, when I'm bucking and spraying.
Me and Will don't play, we got scrill everyday.
We blow kill everyday, biatch.
