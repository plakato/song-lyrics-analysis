You'll Never Guess Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

You'll never guess.
What I found in the floorboards in the basement.
Next to the shovel.
Under the cold cold ground.
You'll never guess.

You'll never guess.
What I found in the earthen floor of the cellar.
Next to the boiler.
In the hot hot coals.
You'll never guess.

Not one for digging up the past.
I said let old ghosts die.
The bones in your closet.
Must be hung out to dry.

You'll never guess.
What I found buried beneath the apple tree.
Wrapped in linen.
And covered in lye.
You'll never guess.

You'll never guess.
What I found outside in the rose garden.
Chopped to pieces.
And cleverly hid.
You'll never guess.

Not one for digging up the past.
I said let old ghosts die.
The bones in your closet.
Must be hung out to dry.

Not one for digging up the past.
I said let old ghosts die.
The bones in your closet.
Must be hung out to dry.

Not one for causing tidal waves.
Just let old dogs lie.
A tiny part of your brain.
Has simply has simply gone awry.
