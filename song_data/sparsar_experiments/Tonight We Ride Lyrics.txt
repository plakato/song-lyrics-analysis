Tonight We Ride Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Hold on to this moment for all time, this is the night we ride.
I hear them calling our name.
Raising the flag and fueling the flame.

I'll find my destination; don't tell me where to go.
I won't give in this time, feel the power.
Not this time, scream it louder.

Voyage o'er the mountains and wastelands.
Far beyond the sea lies fortune.
No regrets, just live for the fight.
Renounce your precious lives and ride.

Take hold of your steel chariot; though ours is gone, lives on.
Rise to the challenge or fall.
Nothing will hinder our rise to the call.

We'll find our destination, can't tell us where to go.
We won't give in this time, feed the hunger.
Not this time, growing stronger.

Voyage o'er the mountains and wastelands.
Far beyond the sea lies fortune.

Voyage o'er the mountains and wastelands.
Far beyond the sea lies fortune.

Fly, redeem tonight.
Destroy, renounce your precious lives and ride.
