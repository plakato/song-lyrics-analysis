A Damn Fool Lyrics
by Swerve.


A Renegade did away with dead weight left the heard Smoking Herb 
Diagnose my sinner ways hard to find like silhouettes from center stage.. 
You stare at me with evil eyes. Trappin me provoking fear 
Whispering deceitful lies, hide behind the smoke and mirrors 
Try to rope me in once. Again, i sever ties can't coax me, in.. 
Better, think again, life changes with the traffic like the light changes 
Do or die this california life's heinous 
And. I love it, but it's tainted 
Baby know it's strange as haiti ain't it 
Lately everything been crazy. 
Trying to get this paper 
I wonder: will it ever stop 
And? Only heaven knows 
God only hears me from my highs.
