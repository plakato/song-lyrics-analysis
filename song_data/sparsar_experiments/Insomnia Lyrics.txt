Insomnia Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

I miss the girl, and the cigarettes.
And the more I try, the more that I forget.
To think of you is a flash to find.
To think of you I find my light to pass the time.

You want me to be that better one.
Time goes slowly with you only.

Insomnia my friend.
Insomnia my friend.

I miss the girl and I lost my light.
So I'm stumbling through this hollow room for peace of mind.
I find that I am going over everything I've said to you, for you.

Insomnia my friend.

Insomnia my friend.

You want me to be that better one.
Time goes slowly with you only.

You want me to be that better one.
Time goes slowly with you only.

Insomnia my friend.
Insomnia my friend.
Insomnia, insomnia.

I miss the girl whose not impressed by.
Insomnia and my cigarette light, my cigarette light.
