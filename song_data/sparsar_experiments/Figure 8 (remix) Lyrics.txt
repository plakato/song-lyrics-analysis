Figure 8 (remix) Lyrics
by Xilent.

Yeah 4x 
Take it all away. 
 
Breathe your smoke into my lungs 
In, the back of a car with you. I stare into the sun 
Still, not too old to die young 2x 
 
But lovers hold on to everything. 
And lovers hold on to anything. 
And lovers hold on to everything: 
And lovers hold on to anything 
 
And. Then you take it all away, 
 
And! Then you take it all away. 
 
I chase your love around a figure. Eight 
I need you more than I can take 
You promise forever and a day 
And. Then you take it all away. 
I chase your love around a figure. Eight 
I need you more than I can take 
You promise forever and a day 
And. Then you take it all away: 
 
Place, a kiss on my cheekbone 
Then, you vanish me I'm buried in the snow 
But. Something tells me I'm not alone. 
 
But lovers hold on to everything. 
And lovers hold on to anything 
 
I chase your love around a figure. Eight 
I need you more than I can take 
You promise forever and a day 
And. Then you take it all. Awa-A-A- 
I chase your love around a figure. Eight 
I need you more than I can take 
You promise forever and a day 
And. Then you take it all away.
