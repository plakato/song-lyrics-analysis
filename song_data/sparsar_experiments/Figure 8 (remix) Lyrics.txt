Figure 8 (remix) Lyrics
by Xilent.

Yeah 4x.
Take it all away.

Breathe your smoke into my lungs.
In the back of a car with you I stare into the sun.
Still not too old to die young 2x.

But lovers hold on to everything.
And lovers hold on to anything.
And lovers hold on to everything.
And lovers hold on to anything.

And then you take it all away.

And then you take it all away.

I chase your love around a figure eight.
I need you more than I can take.
You promise forever and a day.
And then you take it all away.
I chase your love around a figure eight.
I need you more than I can take.
You promise forever and a day.
And then you take it all away.

Place a kiss on my cheekbone.
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow.
But something tells me I'm not alone.

But lovers hold on to everything.
And lovers hold on to anything.

I chase your love around a figure eight.
I need you more than I can take.
You promise forever and a day.
And then you take it all awa-a-a-.
I chase your love around a figure eight.
I need you more than I can take.
You promise forever and a day.
And then you take it all away.
