Carry You Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

Conceal your deepest worries.
Confine your thoughts inside.
The walls you built of damaged pride.
The light in your eyes failing.
Like you're adrift.
Like night pretending to be day.
These storms subside.

Though the past, the unwanted memories, are holding onto you.

Truths you find through your adversities will defend you.
As your powers and all your energies conspire to carry you.

The adversary of your soul.
The blackest thoughts.
That try to poison you.
These storms subside.
Lay down your greatest burden.
Relinquish that which has control of you.
And let yourself through.

Though the past, the unwanted memories, are holding onto you.

Truths you find through your adversities will defend you.
As your powers and all your energies conspire to carry you.

Though it seems the past and future look the same.
Suffice to say that you're still here.

Though the past, the unwanted memories, are holding onto you.

Truths you find through your adversities will defend you.
As your powers and all your energies conspire to carry you.
