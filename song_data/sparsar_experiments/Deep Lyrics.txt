Everytime I flow, it's like I'm whipping the bowl.

Be for real nigga, you ain't gotta flex nigga.
Haha, know you got it from.

Bitches getting deep, pussy on fleek.
Stripping for the dollars, she.

Pull up in that Audi, wrist on.

Living in the trap, bitch, rent cheap!
I was countin up racks when they was sleeping on me.
In the kitchen, still whipping, got a beeper on me.
Pockets deep, 100k in one week.

Bitch wanna ride like {​​​​​​?}​​​​​​.
Riding in the Rari and she leaking.
I'm in Costa Rica for the weekend.
Got my plug on the molly and he geeking.
Money bag extra deep.
Givenchy on my feet.
You riding round in a Porsce but it's leased?
Man in the city throwing money, Big Meech​​.
Bitch bad, I'm gonna fuck her on the beach.
Still talking bout that trap shit.
Young nigga running with a rachet.

Know what I'm saying?
Hold on, lemme check the time..
Whoo!
