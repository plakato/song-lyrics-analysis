Return of the Gods Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Music: Thilo Hermann, Rolf Kasparek.

Ruling the stars, invisible watchers.
Since the beginning of time.
A mighty weapon, the cosmical gender.
Defending the truth and its sign.

The falling of stars, the pain of its children.
It's time for the gods to return.
Hunting the serpent, erasing its madness.
The structure of evil to burn.

Holy laws to set their course.
Wings of steel, a force so real.

The final fight, the force of light.
The fiend to ban, to rule again.

The gods will return, all evil to burn.
Striking the underworlds' lair.
To take back their crown, the terror to drown.
Sons of the sun in its glare.

The gods will return, the evil will learn.
Persistance is ruling their fight.
The evil's on flame, erasing its name.
They are standing in pride with their shimmering armour of light.

Leadbreak Thilo.

Leadbreak Thilo.
