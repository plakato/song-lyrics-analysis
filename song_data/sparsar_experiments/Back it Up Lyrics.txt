Back it Up Lyrics
by UNK.

unnamed woman.
Y'all better look out back there.
I'm fin' to back this big ol' thang up~!
{*truck backing up with beeping noise*}.

Okay now, I need all my ladies to report to the dance floor.
If you got a big, big ol' butt.
You need to be on the dance floor right now cause this is yo' song.
I need all my ladies to back it up.
Ay ay, let's go, ay ay, let's go~!

Back that ass up like a Tonka truck.
Back that ass up like a monster truck.
Back that ass up like a Tonka truck.
Back that ass up like a monster truck.

Make them ass cheeks clap to this hoe.

Unk.
Back that thang up hoe.
Bend over and touch your toes.
Now jack that thang up, whoa~!
Make it roll like them 24's.
Now pull up to the bumper baby.
And make these niggas love you baby.
Big booty on duty, you drive me crazy.
And I got somethin for you lady.

Table dance five dollars you can keep that whole ten!
Whassup, tell that DJ can you play this shit again?
I ain't seen a ass this big, since God knows when.
Back it up.

Unk.
I like the way she move her body.
Patron and Goose inside me.
She turned around politely.

I looked at her like what the fuck?
Excuse me girl, is that your butt?
If it is, then thats what's up.
Throw the motherfuckin dollars up.
Back it up, go on bring it right back.
Work that ass, make a nigga throw a stack.
Tonka truck! She got a ass so fat.
Ummmm - I ain;t seen nothin like dat!
Thirty-six, twenty-fo', thirty-six.
This girl here be super thick.
DJ Unk gotta have some of that.
And I don't give a fuck who you with.
