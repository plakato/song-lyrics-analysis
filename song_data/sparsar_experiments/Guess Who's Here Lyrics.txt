Guess Who's Here Lyrics
by Big Season Muzik.


Y'all rappers saying y'all gonna murder the track, but you won't/Y'all saying that you keep.
it real, but you don't.
This shit ain't even funny, so don't even smile/Cause a lot of rappers be biting too many.
styles.
All of y'all pussy niggas wanna act all hardcore/Between me and y'all, there is no rapport.
Y'all cats won't give me no regards in the game/Ever since Pac &amp; Biggie died, nothing was.
the same.
A lot of y'all niggas be fucking the game up/This is real music, so shut the fuck up.
Cause y'all bitches be acting like y'all from the streets/For real, y'all fake rappers full of.
deceit.

Rappers today are unsatisfactory/Don't worry cause guess who's here in the.
industry.

I can be a money talker, I can be a ladies' man/Sometimes I could be a vicious madman.
All of y'all fake rappers be acting all decent/Y'all know the rap game is full of torment.
Y'all trap MCs got me going berserk/Ruining hip-hop means disrespecting Kool Herc.
Y'all think the industry is about gimmicks/Have you ever heard me go ballistic.
Really, y'all saying that the game is full of happiness/Look into my eyes,.
cause it's full of madness.
Y'all rappers be saying Big Season, you is fucked up/One day, when I enter,.
you gonna be washed up.
I ain't no dumbass stereotype MC/Cause of y'all rappers be actin' corny.
Rappers today are unsatisfactory/Don't worry cause guess who's here in the.
industry.

I'm sick and tired of y'all MCs try to be down/Well, call me Chuck D, because I'm about to shut.
em' down.
I'm hunting y'all niggas, so I'm the blood hound/If you think you all that,.
don't come back to the underground.
Y'all new MCs need some new advice/I'm not hot like fire, I'm cold as ice.
Y'all said y'all get pussy, get a lot of paper/Next thing, I got you.
stuttering like Mayweather.
Today rappers, y'all making me sick/And you, Young Thug, need to suck my dick.

It's gonna take a long time for you to beat me in the cypher/Fuck you and your so-called squad,.
y'all are bunch of fakers.
Everytime I hear that Lifestyle shit, you keep saying/Living like a.
volcano, this is the beginning.
The fuck, you call that shit real hip-hop/To you and your so-called.
hubbies, need to STOP!!!
