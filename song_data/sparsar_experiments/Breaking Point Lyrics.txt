Breaking Point Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Oxys in my dreams.
Let me breathe, let me eat.
Take that motherfucking needle inject me when ima fucking sleep.

Always addicted I got no cash i'm evicted.
You wanna smoke but i'm twitching.
I got the heroin bitches.
I said.

Body slowed down i'm too dependent on chemicals.
My brain gone now I guess it's too late for seminal.
Depressions how I show it.
I hate my life and I know it.
You smoking i'm smoking potent.
We different but you ain't notice aye.
