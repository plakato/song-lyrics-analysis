Fox On The Run Lyrics
by Ace Frehley.

Cause you don't look the same  .
Foxy on the run  .
But the rest of you is out of place  .
Fox on the run  .
Foxy on the run  .
  .
Fox on the run  .
But the names you drop are second hand   .
You looked all right before  .
You scream and everybody comes  .
Fox on the run  .
F-foxy, fox on the run and hideaway  .
Take a run and hide yourself away  .
Fox on the run  .
Foxy on the run  .
Cause you don't look the same  .
  .
Fox on the run  .
  .
  .
You scream and everybody comes a-running  .
I've heard it all before  .
  .
Take a run and hide yourself away  .
The way you did before  .
Fox on the run  .
F-foxy, fox on the run and hideaway  .
.
I don't wanna know your name  .
I don't wanna know your name  .
Fox on the run  .
You scream and everybody comes a-running  .
You, you talk about just every band  .
The way you did before  .
  .
Okay, you think you got a pretty face  .
Fox on the run  .
  .
A-running, take a run and hide yourself away...  .
Fox on the run.
