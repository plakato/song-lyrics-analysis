Live From the P.J.'s Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

Sample.
One two, one two, one two, one two.
So you wanna start up, what we gonna tear shit up?
I said let the turntables talk for me at first.
And then I should finish the rest.

Theodore Deini, Deini, Deini, Deini.
Theodore Deini, Deini, Deini, Deini.
Theodore Deini, Deini, Deini, Deini.
Deeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

Aiyo, what up? Aiyo, what's poppin' and shit.
Yo, this your man, Ghost Deini and shit, Trife Diesel on the side.
Money Come First, Theodore Unit, aiyo, son blind these niggas.
Throw bleachin'.

Trife Da God.
Aiyo, aiyo, what's poppin' out in Stapleton Park, hoppin' the V's.
Call Ghost, special invited host, bring through the seeds.
Sun beamin' like a hundred degrees, yo Tone!
Hurry up, get your ass in the truck, it's time to leave.

Ghostface Killah.
Hold on, I gotta polish my ring, throw on my Clarks.
And you know, I can't iron man garments, without the stars, just.
Double park, give me ten minutes or less.
I overslept, my bitch left, and my crib is a mess.

*scratches and talk*.
If you not down, you not an M.C. or a D.J., off the stage.

Trife Da God.
It's the Theodore event, so they blocked off the streets.
And we came here to chill, but the cops wanna beef.
Little kids, shootin' hoops on the court, playin' horse.
All the young bucks, rocking new gear, try'nna floss.

Ghostface Killah.
Say no more, let's motivate Trife, throw on your poker face.
Spin around the block one time, so we can scope the place.
Yeah, it's lookin' lavish, and the scene looks wonderful.
Pockets full of trees, and my shit look colorful.

Trife Da God.
We got the X-Men spinnin', on the one's and two's.
No drugs, no violence, leave home the guns and tools.
And the grill's just cookin' up chicken and steak.
And greedy ass Uncle Ronnie, yo, he lickin' the plate.

Interlude: ?
Ladies and gentlemen, we got Black Thought in the house tonight.
Yo, he just came from off tour, and I think he wanna spit something, yo!

Black Thought.
Yo, we X-Ecute 'em, with the rapid fire, pealin' your face off.
Sprayin' up the party, from the ceiling with napalm.
Shots follow the target, I ain't gon chase ya'll.
Swinging aluminum bats, that's not for baseball.
It's humor, the way ya'll makin' me laugh.
I'm like a, natural born hustler, gotta get that cash.
The way a natural born, freak, gotta shake that ass.
And anybody wanna eat, gotta break that fast.
A million crabs in a barrel, try'nna make they splash.
Break away fast, nice brother's finish in last.
It don't, matter the speakers, or the hammers can blast.
To handle your ass, frontin', I'mma take your stash.
And twist it, and bake the whole, projects biscuits.
This kid is a trendsetter, ya'll just misfits.
Black Thought, I've been better, ya'll just forgettin' shit.
Now it's a life or death predicament.
I step in with a vendetta, then start spittin' shit.
Then spit game, that's ridiculous, ya'll muthafuckas insignificant.
I'm three fifty seven, magnificent.
Stay playin', where them bad bitches is, you feelin' tonight.
You know they feelin', let the semi automatic bend.
They fend to have 'em in the ghetto, goin' at it, man.
They bring it to your block, have it like Pakistan.
Philly boys bringin' noise, makin' wild static, then.
We trick cops, even jump out vans, and leave you.
Sprayed out, stiffer than a mannequin stance.
You get, laid out, clapped with mechanical hands.
That kick back, cuz, you and your mans'll get zapped.
Just keep, thinkin' my peoples, and peoples'll toy with.
A cold blooded kill shit, and keep on doin' it.
Cuz that's my pleasure, that's the people's enjoyment.
Gangsta's holla at me, if you seekin' employment.
