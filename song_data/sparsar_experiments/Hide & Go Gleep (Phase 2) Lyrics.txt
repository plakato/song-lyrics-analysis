Hide & Go Gleep (Phase 2) Lyrics
by Tyler Major.

Its cloudy outside.
Im feelin like a game of hide and seek i wonder who you'll try to find first.
The worst lurk in the tightest spaces with the marked shirt.
I bet he's not counting and trying to snatch my bag of starburst.
Look at thee...hes taking all the red kind.
Hes knows that its my favorite must be why he asked me for a third time.
A week ago slowly hes been actin kinda funny.
He borrowed my money for lunch didn't ask ...just took it from me.
From that point i understood to watch these guy closely.
Especially when they're not looking---with their mouths foaming.
Asking me whats wrong im making him uncomfortable.
At recess for a buck he sold jenny my pizza lunchable.
\----thats what i said.
Forget this groupie right but since i was 3 we've been like best friends.
The only one ive had thus far and at this age of 5.
Ive never been the one to talk to stangers if they're moms are fine.
