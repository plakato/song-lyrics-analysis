Enemy Is In Your Mind Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


Enemy is in your mind.
Enemy is wasting time.
You got everything you need.
You need to plant the seed.

You blame your wicked head.
For the words you never said.
You take this bitter pill.
To try to break your will.

Here we go again.
It's taking you for a ride.
Here we go again.
The enemy is in your mind.

You've been wandering at night.
Hoping to feel alright.
When are you going to learn.
How to stop this fight.

How come you take this road.
You cannot take it slow.
Enemy is in your mind.
Enemy is wasting time.

Enemy is in your mind.
Enemy is in your mind.
Enemy is in your mind.
Enemy is in your mind.
