Moving in slow motion Lyrics
by The sweet remains.

This old house is cracked and worn.
The walls are faded and the curtains torn.
Sometimes it feels we keep running just to keep from falling behind.
The day is done and won't you come.
Leave the dishses turn the TV off.
I built a fire, whoa and the fire is warm.
Don't know where but I hear the eat of a drum.
Somewhere I swear I hear the strain of a song.
Dance with me to this song.
Dance now darling let your hair run down.
Dance with me all night long.
Dance now darling to this song.
Come to me darling put your and in mine.
Lay your head down on my shoulder.
Give me your lips.
If a kiss is just a kiss I don't know what to make of this.
Although the radio plays only a storm.
Still somewhere I swear I hear the downbeat of a drum.
Dance with me to this song.
Dance now darling let your cares be gone.
Dance with me all night long.
Dance now darling to this song.
So let the long hand run.
Don't let the time worry us.
â€˜Cause when you're in my arms.
I still hear that same sweet song.
And I wanna get lost in this song.
The room's in a spin kaleidescope of light.
Feels just like I'm upside down.
Darlin' don't you set me right.
You got me lost in a feeling.
And I don't wanna be found.
Don't know where but I hear the beat of a drum.
Somewhere I swear I hear the strain of a song.
Dance with me to this song.
Dance now darling let you hair run down.
Dance with me all night long.
Dance now darling to this song.
