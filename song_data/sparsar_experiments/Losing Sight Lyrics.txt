Losing Sight Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

If you can see what's shining through.
I'd like to know just where you're looking to.
Never words I meant to say.
But everybody goes a different way.

If I see only black and white.
Telling me there is something not quite right.
Everything will slip away.
I am losing sight.
And the face that I knew before.
Still she hurts me only so much more.
Do you hear me?
Cos you always seem to blind my heart.

It's not a story with an end.
And all the pages show the time we spend.
Moving slowly walk on by.
When someone else can't look your love inside.

When I see only black and white.
Telling me there is something not quite right.
Everything will slip away.
I am losing sight.
And the face that I knew before.
Still she hurts me only so much more.
Do you hear me when you turn away.
And close the door?

It seems a crime to walk on by.
When someone else can't have your love inside.

If you see only black and white.
Would you tell me there is something not quite right?
Everything has slipped away.
I am losing sight.
And the face that I knew before.
Still she hurts me only so much more.
Do you hear when you turn away and blind my heart?
