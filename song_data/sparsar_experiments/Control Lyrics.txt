Control Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: IHooray! It's a Deathtrip.
Control.
What is this feeling controlling my brain.
Hallucination, am I going insane.
Who is this fool inside of me, I don't know.
Seems like I'm stuck here, there is nowhere to go.
I let myself go crazy.
While staring at the sun.
Never thought of retribution, no.
Inside this never ending spinning wheel.
I control myself.
Is there a reason for going insane.
My own creator is who I will blame.
I twist and turn yeah Lord knows I need a break.
Invite the healer yeah before it's too late.
I let myself go crazy.
While staring at the sun.
Never thought of retribution, no.
Inside this never ending spinning wheel.
I control myself.
I control myself.
