Unreliable You Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


Whenever I get an instant to myself.
It's usually used up, thinking about you.
She's lethal to my mental health.

And everybody knows it but her.
But none of them believe it would work.

Cause they all know me more than I know myself.
But suppose that I forget me and my temores as well.
See senorita I'm in a bit of a dilemma.
I got all this real love to give but nobody I'd want it to enter.
Besides you of course.
But you ain't hear that from me.
I mean, literally.
You ain't hear that from me.
They say I'm scared, I swear I know what I'm doing.
But nevertheless you'd be the first of them I'd have to pursue and.
I'd be fibbing if I told them I wasn't that apprehensive.
Good God, I'm so defenseless.

'Preminiscing' as I refer to it.
I'm afraid of who I'd be if I won you.
I'm afraid of who I'd be if I lose you.
They tell me I can't lose it if I never had it.
But they haven't thought of how it'd feel to see some little boy get at it.
I'm saying....

What are you waiting for.
Tomorrow I might not be anymore.
So what are you waiting for.
You're.
Unreliable.

What am I waiting for.
Tomorrow you might not be anymore.
So what am I waiting for.
You're.
Unreliable.

This girl IRIS used to get home from school and cry.
'twas embedded in her head she was ugly, no girl.
Or guy, especially, wanted anything to do with her.
Screamed at God every night, like what'd he do to her?
Scarlet wrists, she confided in and trusted the blades.
Convinced that none was notice if she decided to stay.
Down the avenue a boy WILL has loved her since he could recall.
Shyest of them all, so she hadn't a clue at all.
He adored her.
Thought she was funny and gorgeous.
But just couldn't muster up the courage to inform her.
Next afternoon, she wasn't in school.
Thought to himself, She ain't been sick the whole year....
So he got her homework for her.
Told himself to finally tell her all about his feelings for her and all.
But when he got inside her house and in her room he found her.
Lying on the carpet in a puddle of her blood.
She was....

He balled uncontrollably.
What if he told her earlier....
Maybe she'd be right by his side.
All he could think about is if he simply came out and said it.
He could have saved her and himself.
Now she'd never get to reply.
Tomorrow's unreliable.

She's unreliable.
He told her he was coming.
Then.
Fell.
To.
Her.
Side.

They're unreliable.

Tell them how you feel.

You're beautiful.

Don't.

Be afraid.
