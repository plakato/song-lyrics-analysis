Love you up Lyrics
by Two Inch Punch.

I can't keep my cool baby, baby.
I can't hold it inside.

I can't wait each day just to shake you up.
Trying to love you up baby, baby.

Each day just to shake you up.
Trying to love you up baby, baby.

Words just ain't enough baby, baby.
Hope it gets to love baby, baby.

It's a perfect situation.
I can't wait each day just to shake you up.
Trying to love you up baby, baby.

Each day just to shake you up.
Trying to love you up baby, baby.
