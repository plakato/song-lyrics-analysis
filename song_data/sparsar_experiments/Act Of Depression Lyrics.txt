Act Of Depression Lyrics
by Underoath.

I tried to cry out from the inside, but I guess my soul did not pour itself.
out enough.
Blood on the walls, flaming black, blood on the walls.
I saw you staring through the cracks.
No one was to know what was happening in me I felt no love.
I felt no reason to carry on with my life.
Everything was wrong, nothing was right, at least that is what I thought.
Kids finding laughter at my expense.
They were killing me on the inside they couldn't give up their pride.
My heart was bleeding from so much grieving.
On the outside I looked fine, you couldn't tell but on the inside was eternal.
hell.
I got caught up in the moment of depression.
And before I knew it my bodywas lying on the ground.
With a gun in my hand my hourglass was out of sand.
Thanks to all the people who drove me to death.
Without you I could of never ended my breath.
Through your anger and hate, I was able to choose my fate.
There was a way out, but I chose the easy route.

them.
Ice cold fingers, body lays on the floor.
Pool of blood you see, you scream out in terror.
Her body is now a part of mutilation, her soul the victim of strangulation.
I will not accept this evil anymore.
I never thought of who I hurt or I never tried to look for the good.
I'm sorry for whoever I hurt, it's not easy to look back on my life.
And know I did not know Christ.
For now I live in a real hell.
I wish I had another chance... then I would live my life with love.
