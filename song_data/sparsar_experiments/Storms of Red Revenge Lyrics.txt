Storms of Red Revenge Lyrics
by Xasthur.

In the name of their bastard son.
They murdered our forests and beliefs.
So your god will forgive?
Yet I shall never!
Our time has come.
Hatred was the spell.
Chosen as our weapon.
Murdering, killing one by one.
Stench of death reaches the sky.
And this time their heaven falls.
In the storms of red revenge.
