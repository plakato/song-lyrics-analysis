Alright RMX Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


Get your hands high in the air - if you think you work as hard as me: 
No hands, ...! That'S what I aught to see! 
Cause! God is good and he handed four jobs to me, 
Two of them part-time. Two, where I work partially 
I, know a lot of niggas not as lucky, though 
Life turned sucky, so they turned yucky bro 
And, that's the nice way to say they turned grimy 
They got no choice but to rob niggas all the time B. 
My my something shiny to flip 
But, please good! Lord! Won'T you find me a brick 
So. I can shave that sh*t 
And make that flip and save that chip 
But, be careful. What you wish for 
You hear the rod but appear to fear the pitchfork 
They say the way you're living is not at all bright. 
But, just fear no man, but God and you'll be all right. 
, 
Alright Baby, don't you cry 
Alright Everything's gon' be all right! 
Alright, I know we can make it through this 
Alright. Don'T let go
