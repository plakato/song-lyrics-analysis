Blow Out The Candle Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Really!? YAH! Everybody love me!
Yeah right!

Popular, lemme give you an example/.
I'll fart on your birthday cake to blow out the candle/.
So say bye bye to all your crappy wishes/.
If I'm spitting food for thought, then gotta do dishes/.
Listen, this whole pursuit to be popular/.
Ain't even worth it, so I'll show you what I've learned/.
I got a sharp mind, sharper than a meat clever/.
I'd be Ludacris before working with Bieber/.
Yeah I got a sharp tongue that could pierce your soul/.
And a raging spirit you'd fear to behold/.
I could rap rectangles, triangles, Circles/.
Trapezoids/ all around these little rapper boys/ that's right/.
That's why/ it's the truth and lemme be honest/.
Impressing you with lyrical skills, I'm beyond it/.
So I'd rather see Babylon be deceased/.
A righteous man rather than a good rapper, capiche/.

HAHAHA!

Greatest Man in history ever named Jesus/.
Had no medicine, yet healer of diseases/.
He had no servants, yet they called him Lord and Master/.
No degree, yet teacher like he had his master's/.
He had no army, yet even the Kings feared him/.
No badge of honor/ yet conquered/ the globe sphere and/.
Did no crime, yet crucified, as a renegade/.
He was buried in a tomb yet he lives today/.
If you ain't pissing somebody off/ you probably.
Ain't doing your job/ stupid/.
See Jesus was perfect, yet he died as a martyr/.
You want to be popular, don't even bother/ It's useless! /.

You ain't go please everybody.
