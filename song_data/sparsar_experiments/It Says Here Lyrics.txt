It Says Here Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

It says, here.
That the unions will never learn.
It says, here.
That the economy is on the upturn.
And it says, here.
We should be proud.
That we are free.
And our free press reflects our democracy.

Those braying voices on the right of the House.
Are echoed down the Street of Shame.
Where politics mix with bingo and tits.
In a money and numbers game.
Where they offer you a feature.
On stockings and suspenders.
Next to a call for stiffer penalties for.
Sex offenders.

It says, here.
That this year's prince is born.
It says, here.
Do you ever wish that you were better informed?
And it says, here.
That we can only stop the rot.
With a large dose of law and order.
And a touch of the short sharp shock.

If this does not reflect your view you should understand.
That those who own the papers also own this land.
And they'd rather you believe.
In Coronation Street capers.
In the war of circulation, it sells newspapers.
Could it be an infringement.
Of the freedom of the press.
To print pictures of women in.
States of undress?

When you wake up to the fact.
That your paper is Tory.
Just remember:.
There are two sides to every story.
