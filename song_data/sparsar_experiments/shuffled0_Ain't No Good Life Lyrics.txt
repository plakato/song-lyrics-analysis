Ain't No Good Life Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Well I can't make no money baby.
Just trying to say.
I said it went on that damn rent.
Oh you'll find it kind of hard on you.
Lord, that don't mean I ain't forgiven.

Don't try that straight life buddy.

Well because my money's already spent.

And I know where it went.
Well I want loving, said I don't need a buddy.
Ain't exactly my idea.
Its sort of old, borrowed and blue.
Well I look back on the good times.
Brother you know you'll only wind up in your own stew.
Well I don't mean change, baby.
Well just because I don't pray.
I don't need nobody, now.
Talking about the good times slipping by.
I don't even know where last month went.
Not the one that I lead.
That don't mean I'm making a living.
It only seems the more that I grieve.
Just don't let nobody tell you, oh what you oughta do.
Yeah I tell ya.
Just because I'm alive.
I'm going to try a dying attempt.
Ain't no good life.
I'm going to get myself together.
I want to know, tell me why is it so.
Women, don't try to cook nothing up, ooh.
Because the more I fight the sadness, yeah.
As some lost part of me.
I mean folding money.
