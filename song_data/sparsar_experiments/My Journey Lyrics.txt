My Journey Lyrics
by 666.

I'm walking on a path.
Which leads into the Darkness.
To the land of eternal night?
Where my soul finds its home.
I arrive to a cemetery.
I draw evil signs on the ground.
I feel this is what I have to do.
Dark forces swirl around me.
At last they'll take me away from the world I knew.
And hated so deeply.
They'll take me there where are neither memories.
Nor needless feelings.
To the land through the Eternal.
