Hey Hoe Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


Yeah 0-4, Wreckshop yeah uh-huh.
Yeah nigga hip hop nigga D-Gotti, DaLo.
A-Threezie, Isis Re yeah we wreck baby.

Hey hoe, I don't care what you going through.
Cause if you coming with me, then you know what you gotta do.
See girl I got the truck outside, and it's sitting on 22's.
So just know if you trying to get to know me, you gotta get to know my crew.

D-Gotti.
Hey hoe, I'm trying to get the bank roll.
Hey hoe, you love me cause I think thoed.
Ain't yo, average gutter nigga.
This ain't your birthday, but baby let me see you jiggle.
In your b-day suit, I don't worry bout the crew.
They always here, baby this is what we do.
Boys misconstrew the troop, I was raised gutter.
I'm trying to raise the cheddar, so me cuffing you down never.
It's whatever honey, let me know if you coming.
I can make you feel stunning, on them rappers with buttons.
It's some'ing on your mind, come with me and relax.
Let your hair down and chill, you iight with Max.
Might get service, all in the truck.
Clinch the wheel, body grip to the buck.
And I had such to get ya, I'ma call you tomorrow.
Fuck it I'ma trick, and let the bitch get spa.

D-Reck.
To the, Hotel.
But hoe know, that you can't go tell.
Cause after the show, we gon bail.
Hit the road and get mo' mail, back to the grind.
Before I try to break this finer mirror, fresh your mind.
Saw your eyes from the stage, you couldn't make up your mind.
But it's all good, cause we all got wood.
And it's all good, and baby you got the goods.
So let us run through it, like some track stars.
Unlike we playing hot, ball in the backyard.
Now we playing strip poker, got you dealing the cards.
Ain't nobody gotta see it, just me and the boys.
Girl go on live your fantasy, come up out them panties.
Doing hand stands, showing out acting nasty.
Doing it with precision, got my niggas listening.
Acting goofy get me, bout to get in where they fit in.

Dirty $.
Say Ms. Thang, you know my sti's.
You want my cheese huh, hey hoe.
I won't say you can't get it, just don't say I can't hit it.
But what I get I gotta split it with my crew, you know.
That's the rules of this game, a playa's rules never change.
When you fucking for the fame it's how it go, hey hoe.
See I ain't the one to judge, all I wanna do is cut.
Run up in them guts, but my budget won't budge baby.
Hey hoe, tell me what it's hitting fo'.
This sucker duck over here, say he got plenty do'.
For a pretty brown like you, but Dolla ain't the type to.
Trick, when I can stick for free.
You wanna stick with me, you gotta be down for whatever.
So give my niggas brain, and make em all feel clever.

A3.
Well I'm a pretty hoe layer, slab parked outside.
Right after, get some customized gunners for my ride.
Know I'm saying, believe me baby it's going down.
They don't call me Pac, but yep I get around.
Eyes planted on a thug, since he stepped in the building.
Looking like your pussy fiending, for sexual healing.
Come here baby, let a G massage your clit.
Body rocking from the back, I know you love that shit.
Boo say she never got it done to her, by a gangsta.
Well that ain't me, but I'm still about to shank ya.
Lay back, raise your legs over your head.
Hold your feet, we about to make the sheets lose thread.
Do the queen with a lot of pipe, riding the spleen.
Make her tilt, like a old pinball machine.
I knew when I met ya, you was bout my cream.
