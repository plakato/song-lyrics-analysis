Cerant Lyrics
by Xazz.

Instrumental.

She was a tall one.
With aspirations wide as her eyes.
You would've never seen it coming.
But I should've known.

I'm a busy, busy man.
With lots of work to do.
Can't always tend to her desire.
But I should've known.

Instrumental.

The bar was dark, and kind of hazy.
Can't hardly see, behind blurred eyes.
But I should've known.

She was sitting there.
With a man in a dark suit.
I swear I saw them disappear.
So I should've known.

Why would she lay with another.
Why can't we look at each other.
I hope she's proud of the choices she has made.
Wish I could fly away.

Instrumental.

And so I sit here, writing this fucking song.
Can hardly put down the bottle.
I wish I'd known.

She lives with the man she lay with that fateful night.
And the guilt, it stays with her.
I wish I'd known.

Why would she lay with another.
Why can't we look at each other.
I hope she's proud of the choices she has made.
Wish I could fly away.

Instrumental.
