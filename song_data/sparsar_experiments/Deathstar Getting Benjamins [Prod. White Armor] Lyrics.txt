Deathstar Getting Benjamins [Prod. White Armor] Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Watch me get these Benjamins.
Watch me get these Benjamins.
Steady posted up in every country ever been.
Watch me get these Benjamins.
Watch me get these Benjamins.
Steady posted up in every country ever been.

Catch me in my Deathstar.
Getting Benjamins.
Death is waiting.
Bitch, I'll send him in.
Getting paper, getting Benjamins.
Death is waiting.
Bitch, I'll send him in.
Gold chain iced up.
Polo shirt priced up.
That coke be sliced up.
My weed be spiced up.
Gold chain iced out.
Polo shirt priced out.
That coke be sliced up.
My weed be spiced up.
Sunrise, Sun Ra.
Burning these trees.
Arizona iced out boyz be stacking them G's.
Sunrise, Sun Ra.
Burning these trees.
Arizona iced out boyz be stacking them G's.

Watch me get these Benjamins.
Watch me get these Benjamins.
Benjamins.
Benjamins.
Benjamins.
Watch me get these Benjamins.
Watch me get these Benjamins.
Bitch, I'll send him in.

Always snorting coke and I'm always sipping soda.
Ralph Lauren cologne.
It's my body odor.
Lean up in the club.
Throwing up, getting crunk.
Chronic in my system.
Bitch I got that vodka in my cup.
Louis belt around my neck.
Paycheck after paycheck.
Strippers on deck.
Lick your pussy on the fucking main deck.
Get my dick licked while playing Yu-Gi-Oh!
From hoes that don't know.
That I'm high from this dro.
Pop that pill.
Get some more.
Puff a rollie.
On to promethazine.
I'm so young drink hella mean.
That's why they call me Yung Lean.

Watch me get these Benjamins.
Watch me get these Benjamins.
Steady posted up in every country ever been.
