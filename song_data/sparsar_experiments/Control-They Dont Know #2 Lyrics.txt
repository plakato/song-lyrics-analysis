Control-They Dont Know #2 Lyrics
by Swish.

Bitches going crazy they don't understand.
30 in the mob and i got in it my hand.
I wanna come up and never come down.
I do this all around i do this for my town.
I seen niggas change and i seen niggas snitch.
The part i don't get is why they wanna switch.
I don't sneak diss but i gotta say wassup.
This young nigga came up and he knew he was outta luck.
I got my own style watch me reach the top.
Balling like kobe you know i can't stop.
Spitting fucken lava so my mouth getting hot.
Im rolling myself i don't need y'all.
Imma do this shit till the day i fall.
And Money looking like yao always standing tall..
And if a nigga acting to hard i let this K bark.
I let it all out.
I let this shit spark.
They Dont Know.
