Control-They Dont Know #2 Lyrics
by Swish.

Bitches going crazy, they don't understand 
30 in the mob and i got in it my hand, 
I wan na come up and never come down. 
I do this all around. I do this for my town, 
I seen niggas change and i seen niggas snitch 
The part. I don't get is why they wan na switch 
I, don't sneak diss, but i got ta, say wassup 
This young nigga came up and he knew he was outta luck. 
I got my own style watch me reach the top 
Balling. Like kobe, you know. I can't stop. 
Spitting fucken lava, so my mouth getting hot 
Im rolling myself. I don't need y'all 
Imma. Do this shit till the day i fall 
And Money looking like yao, always standing tall. 
And. If a nigga acting to hard. I let this K bark 
I, let it all out! 
I, let this shit spark 
They Dont, Know
