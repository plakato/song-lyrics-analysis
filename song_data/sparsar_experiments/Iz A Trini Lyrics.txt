Iz A Trini Lyrics
by Xplicit Entertainment.


I do it for the red.
I do it for the white.
I do it for the black.
Eat a doubles with a slight.
I'z a Trini.
God damn it, I'z a Trini.

In the Carnival fete.
sipping puncheon or a stag.
Or on Store Bay.
eating dumplings with the crab.
I'z a Trini.
God damn it, I'z a Trini.

So wave your rag, nah.
Wave your flag, nah.
If you're from Trinidad, put your hands up.

Wave your rag, nah.
Wave your flag, nah.
If you're from Bago, put your hands up.

RAH! RAH! Put your flags up.
RAH! RAH! Put your rags up.
RAH! RAH! Put your hands up.
If you're from Trinidad, put your hands up.

We're from Trinidad, and that's real talk.
You could check the stamp on my passport.
We like sweet gyal who like sweet talk.
And we're getting money like Lifesport.
We does duck work on.
a Friday.
Link a brethren, ask, Where de lime dey?
By the rum shop,.
cause it's right there.
We does real build it, like highway.
Carnival, we there on the road.
All the gyal them body exposed.
I say they wining up, and the jamming up.
And they tipping all on they toes.
I say I'm swagging all in my clothes.
Gold chains on like Sugar Aloes.
Down here KFC never close.
And Murray Street has the hoes.
BIG MAN THING!
I come to do my thing, shell down crowds when we sing.
BIG MAN THING!
We come to do we thing with this trapso vibes that we bring.
BIG MAN THING!
It's me the gyal Whatsapping, saying she wah roll with the king.
BIG MAN THING!
We come to do we thing, T&amp;T let me hear you sing.
I said I....

Better than Trini? That's hilarious.
We have the best man ever to hold a bat, son... Don't mean Nadia.
Gyals sweet and thick, like a Harry's Punch.
In a B14, that's my.
chariot.
With a bess thing from Siparia.
Clothes real fresh, we up in Aria.
Doing it wet like the Gulf of Paria.
Whoa? Done know!
You're bored? Watch flow.
Want to make 2 million off of soca?
Then call Munro.
All the girls in the fetes like the oil price, go low.
Wine stink, it's no behaviour in public... like Joe.
So.. Carnival down in town.
We chip in a washikong.

Trini and Bago dawg, we do the damn thing.
Beat the rest like a pan stick.
Fast like if it's Kublalsingh.
Bang....

Yeah.
Xplicit.
OD.
Where we from?
Trinidad.
Bago.
