200 Round Clip Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


Nigga, don't get it twisted homie 
Remember, who the fuck I am nigga, 
Nah fuck. That lem me show you 
Two-hundred round. 
 
I make a murder with 2 hundred rounds of venom. I get in'em 
Make. You wish you had a wish. Your bitches supersoak, your denim 
I, be in some sicker shit. You wan na bitch about it, bring your bitch around and
we gon, see if she'll, let you in 
And I make her friend and take her end up on the rubber undercover 
When. I smother anyone give me a minute and some butter 
I don't talk about it better, be about it 
Never doubt a motherfucker who done spent a gang of time up in the gutter
 
Puttin' the work in ain't, no buster 
Feelin' the rush and put'em in dust. 
On top of the roof, I'm ready to bust 
I'm choppin''em all into minimal nuts 
And droppin' them all into the bus. 
I fill the streets up with they death Beretta issue 
will I bitch around and put you on the bus 
So quit your bitchin' and your dissin'. Don'T nobody even listen 
But to mention that you wish you bustin' back to pay attention 
But you weep before you speak 
You, better, be thinkin' about the demon comin' up into the house to meet you
with the blade and cut the tension. 
 
Open'em up when they mumble a word about the Brainsick 
I behave like I, ain't got no common sense, 
I mean I'm really on the fence. 
I'Ll turn your meat up into mince 
I'm makin' samples out you bitches 
I'll be damned if I'mma, let you go to sleep before I rinse 
Your blood. Up on my hand, I take you deep into the voodoo ritual 
You, probably thought about it. Shit I'll diss him in a video 
And, maybe he'll, respond and boost my music 
And. I lose a couple thousand followers. 
And quit your job because you finna blow
