Move On Lyrics
by The Union.

* first twenty seconds is talking by crew *.

L.S..
I gotta question.
I gotta question.
I'm pushin about five fifty-five on the mic, how much you benchin?
I'm givin all y'all yahoo niggas some new shit to jig to.
I had to slit you small like that crack in the wall you slid through.
And there ain't no callin draw.
Whether you my man, or some shorty comin with the raw.
I fuck around, and get lost in the portal.
Quantum combat, oh I forget, you only mortals.
Comin with that normal kid I wrap you up in coil.
Hit you up and watch your body burn when it bubble.
I'll rip your lampshades, as I rant and rave.
I'm raw, plus I got more plants to blaze.
It's a fact that fiends, come back to Lean.
With vials, long as that aisle in back of Queens.
Plus I pack macs with beams.
I'm type fear, I'm that nightmare that killed that dream.
My gat steam, crazy buzz.
I slid with ?, plus severe for you baby luv.
I play the role til I'm gray and old.
HEYYY HOOOOO, witcha pops on the payroll.
No doubt, I'm cold out withcha ??
South to border, I come lay em out for ya.
For these liquid assets.
This thick-lipped bastard stay, dipped in plastic.

Outlaw.
Representin, 1998.
Pac, peace my nigga.
Nino, peace my nigga.
Aight?

It's all good we move on.
Check we out we move on.
Rock like this we move on.
I'm far from a busta!
Rock like this we move on.
Rock like this we move on.
Rock like this we move.. it's just a freestyle!
