I Could Die Rite Now Lyrics
by Yung God.


So Much Drugs In My System I Don't even Know If I'mma Make It..
Uh,.
x4.
Hehe.

I Been Looking For Something To Slow My Heart Beat Down.
Take My Feet Off The Ground, So Much Lean I Could Drown.
Make The Sky Black Out.
Where I Can't See a Thing, And I Can't Hear A Sound.
Turn The Bass Up Loud.
I Could Die Right Now.

Nigga Thinking To Myself if I Overdose.
I Would Re-Incarnate As The Holy Ghost.
I Would Re-Incarnate As Some Sticky Dro.
Yung God Got More Drugs Than A Hippie Tho.
Something That Would Paralyze From My Head to Toe.
Need My Own Paramedics In The Studio.
Thinking If I Die Right Now I Would Be A Legend.
So High Nigga Sitting Right Above Heaven.

Prescription Pills.
Make Me Feel.
So Unreal.
It Might Kill.
Some Brain Cells.
But I Don't Care.
Take Me There.

GOOOOODDDD!!!!!
