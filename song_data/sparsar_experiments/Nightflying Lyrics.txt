Nightflying Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

We go where no one goes.
No time for radios.
Just move in the right direction.
She'll come out tonight.

She said it's her surprise.
One right to no more lies.
One taste of my demise.
Will never come about.

She said.
Would you like a taste of my honey?
Just try a taste of my honey?
A picture* now, a little more funny.
I think I'd like a little more money.

Night flying, sky diving.
Free fall, get you out of my mind.
No lying, slow dying.
You wear a smile but you're never too kind.
You wear a smile but you're never to kind.

And then I thought I heard it thunder.
I thought I also heard you call.
But now I have to stop to wonder.
Were we really there at all?

Lights changing all around.
Treating* just for the sound.
She comes and then she goes.
Like she's moving underground.

I like what I can't see.
She wants some place* to me.
But I see for as we go.
Just to let the others know.

She said.
Would you like a taste of my honey?
I think it's time for a taste of my honey.

Night flying, sky diving.
Free fall, get you out of my mind.
No lying, slow dying.
You wear a smile but you're never to kind.
You wear a smile but you're never to kind.

And then I thought I heard it thunder.
I thought I also heard you call.
But now I have to stop to wonder.
Were we really there at all?

I don't like this I really must go.
I don't like this I really must go.
I don't like this I really must go.
I don't like this I really must go.
I don't like this I really must go.
I don't like this I really must go.

And then I thought I heard it thunder.
I thought I also heard you call.
And it goes on like this forever.
Night flying up before the fall.

And it goes on like this forever.
And it goes on like this forever.
And it goes on like this forever.
We are not really here at all.
We are not really here at all.
