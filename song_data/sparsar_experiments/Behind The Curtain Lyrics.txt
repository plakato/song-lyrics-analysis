Behind The Curtain Lyrics
by Volumes.

He hides behind the curtain.
In the middle of a storm.
Relax they have your answer.
Given to you on a platform.
It's the forty fourth consecutive one.
To downplay us.
Deny us our beliefs.
So with the current status of state.
I declare a mockery.
You betrayed me.
The neighborhoods rise today.
And that's a fact.
They made a martyr of the matter in me.
You betrayed me.
The neighborhoods rise today.
And that's a fact.
They made a martyr of the matter in me.
The neighborhoods will not run away my honor.
We were born.
I have been culture shocked.
By this modern place.
This has been their plan for years to come.
No fathers will roll over in their graves.
This has been their plan for years.
The signing of the dead.
And the bodies you showed me.
Put me in the plastic box that I paid for.
The signing of the dead.
The bodies that they showed.
Put me in my plastic box that I paid for.
Kill all of them in front of me.
Make sure their faces hit the pavement.
