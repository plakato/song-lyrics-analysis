Mardi Gras Boulevard Lyrics
by Tyler Tracey.


On the Mardi Gras Boulevard we tear shit up and then we tear shit down.
When I first arrived on the Boulevard it was a deserted ghost town.
But after playing some of my sound it's now the hottest spot around.
Because we done turned uptown into downtown.
We going from the time we wake up 'til well past dark.
We spend the money we make because it's work hard, play hard.
Go until I only have one shoe and a maxed out credit card.
So whether you're broke or loaded there's a spot for you on the Boulevard.

We are on the Boulevard.
Turn up on the Boulevard.
We always go oh so hard.
On the Mardi Gras Boulevard.

Now we cruising in pickup trucks with the subs on blast.
Picking up hunnies looking like Playboy Bunnies showing off some of that ass.
Doing anything we can to show off some of our cash.
Blowing it all because we going to make it back fast.
Blowing all our money on pointless things.
Living life to the fullest, never to the dullest.
Taking shots like bullets, strange like mullets.
Wandering around happy like a foreign tourist.
Partying hard, this is our calling card.
This world is ours to leave our mark.
So lets rock and lets roll.
That's life on the Boulevard.
