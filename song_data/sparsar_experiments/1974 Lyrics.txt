1974 Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

The sun is shining hard at my feet.
And the city is an animal ready to eat.

It's raining like a nose bleed, cigarettes and sweets.
And I feel it coming on.
Bloody as the day I was born.

It's 1974.
Just like the day I was born.
It's 1974.

She isn't crazy.
She's just not impressed.
She stabs me with her eyes.
Dirty knives hidden in her dress.

And it's raining like bombs in my room when I'm alone.
And I swear I think I knew you before.
Just like the day I was born.

It's 1974.
Just like the day I was born.
It's 1974.
Just like the day I was born.
It's 1974.
Just like the day I was born.
It's 1974.

Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it, come on.
Do you want it, do you want it, come on just bring it on.
Nothing gonna stop it now.
But nothing.
Do you want it, come on.
Do you want it, do you want it, come on just bring it on.

It's 1974.
It's 1974.
It's 1974.
It's 1974.
