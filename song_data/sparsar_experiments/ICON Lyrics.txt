ICON.

I said a icon con , I said you a icon con, if you getting moneY throw ya.
hands upI said ICON a icon con, I said you a icon con, if you in the party getting saucy as f*** /.

Why build a city but no one to visit b/ I hold the lights to the city like.
ms. Liberty/Blackrolling stones its bout.
money and loyalty/ Let the small things slide and you won't be a thing/ IM a.
icon like that pic on youR DESKTOP/ thaTS.
ya wifey ya girl give the best top/. And she be wilding when im scoring like.
a mascot/ Milly on the island and he.
calling hold on ma, a huh legendary like cool g , LL, or daddy cane, back to.
my time big l, pun and jay. Hood rock with.
me like jesus on ya chain, its not all about money but im doing my thing.

I said IÃ•m a icon con , I said you a icon con, if you getting money throw ya.
hands up I said IM a icon con, I said you a icon con, if you in the party.
getting saucy as f***.

Iconic like illmatic mix with CHORNIC/ I.
tried to detox still im toxic, can't beef with a snitch call his co defendant.
, taking hip hop to new heights so vote 4 it. You peddle packs I move boats 4.
it, I bang back you let it sly, stay broke 4 it. Ghetto spokesman lyrically.
hope for em , bootlegers straight new form of dope 4 em. Pimping ladies in the.
clubs adore em, im like the new im coming and the want it. Harlem world.
broadway this Panamanian blunted. They envy the aura cause they girlfriend.
love it. These artist follow trends like a t pain plug in , im just doing me.
like the pain is plugged in. sometimes you gotta crash just to see the vision,.
they say im like a og when I be spitting.

I said ICON a icon con , I said you a icon con, if you getting money throw ya.
hands up I said Im a icon con, I said you a icon con, if you in the party.
getting saucy as f***.

Word play like a thesaurus none bitten/ got a icon my greatest never written/.
eye of a tiger he will claw for his spinich/tainting with the mission, why.
that boy end up missing/Tell the truth I ain't have a pot to piss in/ but I.
eat with my fam til the yhats just flow in, I dont forget the past but the.
future is impressing/ so I remember that when ya boy is stressing/ Kush in.
bible paper I count my blessings u a allergie get attacted like Claritin/.
Bangs with the best doggs you to femeine/.
