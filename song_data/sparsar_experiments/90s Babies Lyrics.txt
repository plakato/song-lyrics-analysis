90s Babies Lyrics

All y'all turning up, all y'all getting fly.
All y'all having sex, looking for girls who ride.
I don't really see me in you mutha' fukkas.
So i'm not gonna' be any of these mutha' fukkas.

From Atlanta but not by the sounds of it.
We some dogs, we got some kush, blow a pound of it.
Speaking of counting shit.
The money's long overdue.
Speaking of ex bitches.
I'm long over you.
Money hitting my account.
Labels hitting up my phone.
Hit the mall to buy a purse.
For my mom i'm feeling home.
I blew past all you losers standing looking like dummies.
I turned up, got my little sister looking like money.
Y'all got this game fucked up.

All y'all turning up, all y'all getting fly.
All y'all having sex, looking for girls who ride.
I don't really see me in you mutha' fukkas.
So i'm not gonna' be any of these mutha' fukkas.

90s baby, baby grew up watching television.
But I had a vision, now i'm on the television.
I smoke hella weed, but i'm high with a purpose.
Singing like gospel churches.

I tell her to believe.
Believe in something higher.
All she tell me back.
I'm preaching to the choir.
And we gon' burn one.
'Til we both numb.
'Til we both numb.

When you wake up smelling like roses.
Let me taste your flower.
Im gonna garden all your seeds.
Make the sunlight in you shower.
Hit the blunt one time it's sour.
Got some hours I owe the government.
For fucking with some broken ass girls who need their mother.
It's crazy how y'all justify bullshit as your day to day.
Hindering yourself because your disposition, make a way.
Even with those crutches you can limp across the finish line.
You can limp across the finish line.

All y'all turning up, all y'all getting fly.
All y'all having sex, looking for girls who ride.
I don't really see me in you mutha' fukkas.
So i'm not gonna' be any of these mutha' fukkas.
