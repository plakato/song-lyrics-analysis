Test Your Metal Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Test your metal.

You been around town with an original sound and everyone knows who you are.
All you really got is your name, but everybody loves you the same.
The party don't start till you walk in the bar, and the crowd is waiting on.
you.
As soon as they hit the lights, take flight.
But there's not many places you can play and all the faces stay the same.
I'm not trying to say this town is lame but it's time.

Test your metal.
Hot city nights, under city lights; we are the night.

Trust me when I say to hit the road and escape, can you hear them calling for.
you.
Just try to take it day by day, the next town ain't so far away.
There's a world outside lets take a ride, I'm not gonna say it again.
Now's the only chance you got to rock.
Don't let your dreams get away, get up, go forth and make them screamâ€¦ It's.
time.

Test your metal.
Hot city nights, under city lights; we are the night.
Test your metal.
Hot city nights, under city lights; we are the night.
