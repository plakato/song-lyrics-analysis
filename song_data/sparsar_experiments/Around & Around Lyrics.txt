Around & Around Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

The moon was shinning.
The stars lit up the sky.
The fire reflected in their eyes.
Holding hands, sharing stories, sharing thoughts.
For once, they enjoyed a peace of mind.
Happiness spreading through the air.
That night everyone was smiling.
They danced carelessly.
They danced carelessly.
They danced carelessly.
They danced around the fire.
Around &amp; around.
Around &amp; around.

The moon was shinning.
The stars lit up the sky.
The fire reflected in their eyes.
