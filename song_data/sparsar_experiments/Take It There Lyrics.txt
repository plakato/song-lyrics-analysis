Take It There Lyrics
by 67.


Same way I cut shapes in the rave.
I dip, dip, dip man's face.
Niggas know how we got down days.
Them scars had him looking like a slave.
I do it, like my broski Skeng.
Fuck legs, all I wanted was a face.
No face, no case.
So-something go dead up today.
Whiz round, put a nigga in his place.
Doing drive-bys, hitting no one, bruh that's a waste.
Ten toes on the block with the gang hella times on the pave.
Make blood spill, not 'Gnac when I.
step on your pave.
More money, more problems were words from Biggie and Ma$e.
? in my hand when I step, no case, no trace.
Skeng to your mouth like ?, like ? and paste.
With the smoke I'm smoking, chilling with the gang in the rave.

Wanna take it there, we can take it there.
Skeng in the four door truck, Opp block, take it there.
Bro's got both in O, you know he's gonna rake it there.
Most of the team in jail, still getting paid in there.
Niggas know how we got down days, how you gonna make it fair?
Same way we got down Capo, you could never make it fair.
Wanna take it there, we can take it there.
Skeng in the four door truck, Opp block, take it there.
Opp block take it there.

My phone line's jumpy.

I can move grub on the ends but I love it in country.
I got serious hooters, they're way too dumpy.
Got a Chopper, some spinners and dumpies.
My sister's lovely.
She said Do this music ting, man, lowe all the fuckery.
I do road on some serious guys, man serious monkeys.
Feds at my mum's door, try'na do man some fuckery.
Cause I'll crash for my bro, don't judge me.
Trap, trap, trap.
My phone went slow, so I done footwork on the map.
My name ring bells, try me, catch bells in your back.
Allow my lil' bro like Maddox, big fat skeng in his rusty bag.

Wanna take it there, we can take it there.
Skeng in the four door truck, Opp block, take it there.
Bro's got both in O, you know he's gonna rake it there.
Most of the team in jail, still getting paid in there.
Niggas know how we got down days, how you gonna make it fair?
Same way we got down Capo, you could never make it fair.
Wanna take it there, we can take it there.
Skeng in the four door truck, Opp block, take it there.
Opp block take it there.

I came back from the trap.
My clothes and my socks are smelling all mad.
But I do it for the bands.
Skeng in the four door truck.
Try'na smoke them man.
They say smoking kills but the mandem still do drills, it's mad.
Opp block, take it there.
Two skengs in an automatic, we ain't playing fair.
12 Gauge makes some mad noise, spins on my side like a cowboy.
The streets are cold and we're holding pose.
You can hold the smoke from this Nine boy.
Free the guys and fuck the pigs.
I'm in the trap house taking loads of risks.
I love my drillers, they take loads of risks.
The same way you'll blow for me, I'll blow for Skribz.

Wanna take it there, we can take it there.
Skeng in the four door truck, Opp block, take it there.
Bro's got both in O, you know he's gonna rake it there.
Most of the team in jail, still getting paid in there.
Niggas know how we got down days, how you gonna make it fair?
Same way we got down Capo, you could never make it fair.
Wanna take it there, we can take it there.
Skeng in the four door truck, Opp block, take it there.
Opp block take it there.
