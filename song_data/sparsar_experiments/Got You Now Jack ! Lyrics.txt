Got You Now Jack ! Lyrics
by Tyler.

I want to make a rap but I can't rap worth crap I can't rhyme with my time.
with my time on the line I can rhyme smack with wack and then that's all I got.
to tell you Jack you talk smack but I got to tell you something rhyming just.
ain't my thing man I don't know how to twist a rhyme with another rhyme but by.
the time I think of another rhyme it's stolen from me by another rapper who.
doesn't have crap to rap I said hey Jack get back why did you come to rap why.
are you talking crap you can't even rap this guy thinks he's all that but I.
got a fact he can't sorry about that Jack.
