Behind Eyeballs Lyrics
by Tyler Major.

Nobody knows this like them stories of Moses.
I was never bout them cakersman but i remember the hostess.
The jokes is in the frying pan, you should make tilapia.
They say theres bigger fish to fry like them guys that are backin ya.
Dont make me the middle man cuz you can probably tell.
When the kitchens getting warm you steam up quicker than a sale.
In a noonday, but you can never read into what dude say.
Its all about your principles at the end and its a school day.
Higher classes going ..slower than molasses on a drip drop.
Stick her with your dragoon for her spin top.
Young lad raised to grow and be a doctrate.
So much pressure he can't seem to get his socks to fit.
But its all in a days work.
Striving for your never ending dream,BBC sweatshirt.
Designed by you with your intials on the button.
Not living your dream is worse than being the kid who ate his lunch in.
Doors close when you turn that left cheek.
Sworn to leave geek, assumed your life story in one week.

Try again.
