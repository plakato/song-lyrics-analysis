Let's Get Known Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

Say, let's get known.
If we keep it up, we'll show the haters.
It's gonna be soon not later.

Hey! Let's get known!
If we work real hard, we can buy some matching clothes.
For our live shows.

Look at the ants on the floor.
They work real hard, lifting 3 times their mass.
And sometimes more.

So what do you say?
Let's get known.
Let's have 3 spotlights shining.
With all our work shown.

What do you say? It's all on the line.
