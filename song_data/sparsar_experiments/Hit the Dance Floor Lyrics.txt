Hit the Dance Floor Lyrics
by UNK.


Now hit the dance flo', and bend your back low.

Shorty hit the dance now hit the dance now hit the dance flo'.
Now hit the dance now hit the dance now hit the dance flo'.
Now hit the dance flo', and bend your back low.
She do it with no hands, now stop pop and roll.

Unk.
Go 'head you got it momma, this right here yo' time to shine.
Grab your girl, hit the floor, I see you stayin on your grind.
I watch you twerk it baby, drop that thang to the flo'.
Now tell a friend that this yo' song, girl bend your back low.
She keep her hair fixex, she keep her nails done.
She goin by the bar, she throw a thousand ones.
She rock the stunna shades, Jazze she a stunna man.
Oh she see a stunna man, yeah Unk I'm the man.
Now brush your shoulders off, make that money let 'em hate.
Why you all in V.I.P. them other broads sit and wait.
I see you came to party, Big Oomp we be off the ave.
Smoke exotic kush, hypnotic girl did it with no hands.
I like the way she drop it, wobble and shake it.
Make make me wanna get naked, you wet it, do it, don't fake it.
Now break it down  girl throw yo' back at it.
Do your dance on the flo' and make 'em throw a stack at it.

Unk.
You gotta love it baby, you as fly as the sky.
Now work that Tinkerbell for that M-O-N-E-Y.
I see it in your eyes, dancin yeah she got the glare.
The baddest chick up in the club that's why they stop and stare.
The party's over here, yeah the party's over there.
The women representin and my niggas everywhere.
The club jumpin, DJ tell 'em hit the dance flo'.
Got DJ Montay on the beat now watch the speakers blow.
Yea baby girl, make 'em see a show.
Just pop it, drop it, down down to the flo'.
Your boy Unk representin, I do this for the people.
Got Big Oomp on my chain, she see my diamonds lethal.
I see she shakin plenty, cause she's a money maker.
Do this one for your boi, shake your salt shaker.
So go on and get your crew, and meet me on the flo'.
If you ain't here to party, you can hit the do'.

Interlude.
Now get low, get low, get low, get low.
Get low, get low, get low, get low.
Get low, get low, get low, get low.
Get low, get low, get low, get low.
Now bend your back low, ay bend your back low.
Ay bend your back low, now stop pop and roll.
Ay bend your back low, ay bend your back low.
Ay bend your back low, now stop pop and roll.
