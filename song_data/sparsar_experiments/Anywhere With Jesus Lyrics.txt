Anywhere With Jesus Lyrics
by Amy Grant.


Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
Anywhere he leads me in this world below.
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade.
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

Anywhere, anywhere ...any little fear I'll never.
Know.
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
Anwhere with Jesus, I am not alone.
Other friends may fail me, he is still my own.
Tho' His hand may lead me over dearest ways.
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

Anywhere with Jesus can go to sleep.
When the darkest shadows round about me.
Creep.
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam.
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
