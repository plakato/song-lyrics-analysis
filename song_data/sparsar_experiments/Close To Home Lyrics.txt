Close To Home Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

Listen up everybody.

To those working in banks and armed service ranks.
To all the children born and raised in internment camps.
To all the youth sittin' in front of your TVs, at home.
Listen up everybody.

There's no U-N-I-T-Y.
That you can hide behind.
Life is eye for an eye.
Would you die for your pride.
You cannot survive.
Are you not surprised.
When they cock their guns?
Committing Nazi crimes.
You gotta walk to run.
There's a name to be given.
To a loaded semi automatic hatred you feelin'.
It's the face that are feelin'.
This patriotism is the core.
Of this whole generation we live in.
No it ain't the beginnin'.
You're life's at risk.
You might be conscripted.
And sent off to fight.
To a place where the air's like nitroglycerin.
And every night.
Prayin' to see your wife and kids again.
The cycle's vicious when.
You're right in between it.
You don't like the system but your fightin' to keep it.
When we gonna learn through it?
Gonna turn your blind eye.
Hoping  in time you and I can do it.
Put your mind to it.

As I lay my soul down to sleep.
I reach deep.
Pray to have some ground to keep.
And be free.
Without the need to hold the chrome.
It always seems so much worse.
When it's close to home.

As I lay my soul down to sleep.
I pray the Lord save my friends and my family.
And keep me.
Please protect my boundaries.
I listen to the bombs fall.
Till I'm sound asleep.

I'm like fuck anybody.
That turned in some person.
Livin' next door to him.
Cause the dudes is wearin' a turbin.
Workin' hard, 9 to 5, payin his taxes.
Only to come home get harrassed.
And asked if he's.
In anyway related to Al Qaeda.
Cause the neighbours suspicious of his behaviour.
And then they go an' call it patriotism.
But it's hate that is driven.
And so the racism sits and it grows.
In the pits of your souls.
Until the shit just explodes.
And you're bombing people.
That are calm and peaceful.
Claimin' it's for the goal.
Of protecting your children.
But how the fuck are the children being protected.
When we're building the weapons to kill them with?
It just doesn't make sense to me.
We're gettin' screwed and we been doing it for centuries.
Just sendin' these kids off to their deaths.
As we sit, watch press releases.
And pledge allegiance, but.

To those working in banks and armed service ranks.
To all the children born and raised in internment camps.
To all the youth sittin' in front of your TVs.
At home.
Listen up everybody.

As I lay my soul down to sleep.
I reach deep.
Pray to have some ground to keep.
And be free.
Without the need to hold the chrome.
It always seems so much worse.
When it's close to home.

As I lay my soul down to sleep.
I pray the Lord, save my friends and my family.
And keep me.
Please protect my boundaries.
I listen to the bombs fall.
Till I'm sound asleep.

The bottom line is.
That they got us all falling in line.
Cause they got us forgettin' the past behind us.
You can't supply foreign lands with mines.
And not finance these guns into the hands of minors.
And most of them look just like me, don't they?
And most of you think I just might be.
Some religious fanatic with tricks up my sleeve.
Ready to hi-jack this airbus and bust 19.
But the bottom line is that they got our minds twisted and.
Got us focusing our lives on our differences.
I must have missed it if your God's different than mine, and.
I hope you're getting what I tryin to fit in this rhyme and.
When they come in the morning to take us.
I hope you quit your hemming and hawing and wake up.
And when they make you disappear without a trace.
Cause of what you believe.
Please remember these words.

As I lay my soul down to sleep.
I reach deep.
Pray to have some ground to keep.
And be free.
Without the need to hold the chrome.
It always seems so much worse.
When it's close to home.

As I lay my soul down to sleep.
I pray the Lord save my friends and my family.
And keep me.
Please protect my boundaries.
I listen to the bombs fall.
Till I'm sound asleep.

I listen to the tanks roll.
Till I'm sound asleep.
I listen to the Jews march.
Till I'm sound asleep.
Sound asleep.
Till I'm sound asleep.
I listen to the Jews march right down my street.

The electricity's off.
Supermarkets are closed off.
Phone's dead.
There's soldiers in the streets.
Right here in your promised land.
It's too late.
You waited, debated, sedated for years.
You stated it could never happen in our corner.
Now wake up and smell the books burnin'.
