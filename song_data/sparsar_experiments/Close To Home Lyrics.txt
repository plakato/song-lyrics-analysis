Close To Home Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

Listen up: everybody 
 
To, those working in banks and armed service ranks 
To. All the children born and raised in internment camps. 
To. All the youth sittin' in front of your TVs at home. 
Listen up everybody, 
 
There's, no U-N-I-T-Y 
That you can hide behind. 
Life is eye for an eye. 
Would you die for your pride. 
You cannot survive 
Are, you not surprised 
When, they cock their guns. 
Committing Nazi crimes, 
You got ta, walk to run, 
There's a name to be given 
To a loaded, semi automatic hatred. You feelin' 
It's the face that are feelin' 
This. Patriotism is the core 
Of, this whole generation we live in 
No it ain't. The beginnin' 
You're life's at risk 
You might be conscripted. 
And sent off to fight 
To a place where the air's, like nitroglycerin 
And every night, 
Prayin', to see your wife and kids again, 
The cycle's vicious when 
You're right in between it 
You, don't like the system, but your fightin' to keep it 
When. We gon na learn through it 
 Gon na turn your blind eye 
Hoping in time. You and I can do it 
Put your mind to it. 
 
As, I lay my soul down to sleep. 
I reach deep 
Pray to have some ground to keep 
And, be free. 
Without the need to hold the chrome 
It always seems so much worse. 
When, it's close to home 
 
As. I lay my soul down to sleep, 
I pray, the Lord save my friends and my family 
And. Keep me 
Please, protect my boundaries. 
I, listen to the bombs fall 
Till, I'm sound asleep. 
 
I'm, like fuck anybody, 
That turned in some person, 
Livin' next door to him. 
Cause. The dudes is wearin' a turbin 
Workin' hard 9 to 5 payin. His taxes 
Only to come home, get harrassed 
And asked. If he's 
In anyway related to Al Qaeda 
Cause the neighbours suspicious of his behaviour 
And, then they go an' call it patriotism, 
But, it's hate that is driven 
And, so the racism sits and it grows 
In. The pits of your souls 
Until the shit just explodes 
And you're bombing people 
That - are calm and peaceful 
Claimin'. It'S for the goal. 
Of protecting your children 
But how the fuck are the children being protected, 
When we're building the weapons to kill them with 
It. Just doesn't make sense to me: 
We're gettin' screwed, and we been doing it for centuries: 
Just sendin', these kids off to their deaths, 
As, we sit, watch press releases, 
And pledge allegiance, but 
 
To, those working in banks and armed service ranks 
To all the children born And raised in internment camps, 
To all the youth sittin' in front of your TVs, 
At home 
Listen up everybody, 
 
As. I lay my soul down to sleep. 
I reach deep 
Pray to have some ground to keep 
And be free, 
Without. The need to hold the chrome 
It always seems so much worse. 
When, it's close to home 
 
As. I lay my soul down to sleep, 
I pray, the Lord save my friends and my family 
And. Keep me 
Please, protect my boundaries, 
I, listen to the bombs fall 
Till, I'm sound, asleep, 
 
The bottom line is 
That. They got us all falling in line 
Cause. They got us forgettin', the past behind us, 
You can't supply foreign lands with mines, 
And, not finance these guns into the hands of minors 
And most of them look just like me, don't they 
And? Most of you think I just might be 
Some religious fanatic with tricks up my sleeve 
Ready to hi-jack this airbus and bust 19 
But. The bottom line is that they got our minds twisted and 
Got us focusing our lives on our differences. 
I must have missed it. If your God's different than mine and 
I hope you're getting what I tryin to fit in this rhyme and 
When, they come in the morning to take us 
I hope you quit your hemming and hawing and wake up 
And when they make you disappear without a trace. 
Cause of what you believe, 
Please remember these words 
 
As. I lay my soul down to sleep. 
I reach, deep 
Pray to have some ground to keep 
And be free, 
Without. The need to hold the chrome 
It always seems so much worse. 
When, it's close to home. 
 
As, I lay my soul down to sleep, 
I pray, the Lord save my friends and my family 
And. Keep me 
Please, protect my boundaries, 
I, listen to the bombs fall 
Till, I'm sound, asleep, 
 
I, listen to the tanks, roll 
Till, I'm sound, asleep! 
I! Listen to the Jews march 
Till, I'm sound asleep, 
Sound, asleep 
Till, I'm sound asleep. 
I, listen to the Jews march right down. My street 
 
The electricity's off 
Supermarkets are closed off 
Phone's dead, 
There's soldiers in the streets 
Right here in your promised land 
It's too late. 
You waited debated sedated for years. 
You stated it could never happen in our corner. 
Now: wake up and smell the books, burnin'
