Count Up Lyrics
by VonBock.

Yeah.
I'm just tryna.
Aye.

I'm luvin all this hate tell my riders mount up.
I'm just tryna stack my dollars tell these others count up.
Cuz I'm whippin' slow and I'm livin' fast.
Selling out my soul for the grip of cash.
I'm just tryna stack my dollars tell these others count up.
Yeah.

I'm whippin' slow, catch me livin' fast.
Speakers bang out the back while I be rollin' class.
Pull up at the light, I got my windows cracked.
Bass leaking like some oil when I hit da gas.

Chicken to my right, gotta rollin douja.
Smokers club, we keep that purple lean up inda soda.
I light it once, then I sip it back.
Then I'm twisted back, just livin' like aristocrats.

These females looking feisty, shit, I give the digits.
I tell her give the ring but never cuffin' when we kick it.
She say remember me? I say remember this.
Cold hearted from the moment of our first kiss.

Dollar bill my luv, I'm presidential speaking.
Money first, but keep them pennies droppin' like the weekend.
I keep my count up and turn the hate down.
Like volume in the ride, they pumping brakes now.

Catch me laughing in the tenant, whips is all good.
Grinding in the morning through the day, I'm up in Hollywood.
I ain't signing deals, I'm rolling independent.
Last offer told me Macklemore would get my penning.

So I say fuck the fame, and fuck the major labels.
They ain't stacking, they ain't winning, they just selling fables.
See I'm rocking shows, bounce with me, bounce, rock.
Jump, jump, jump, let them bottles pop.

Bitches flocking the flocking by the fucking feather.
Just hoping Imma count it up and change the weather.
Like swish, whatchu think dis fucking.
is.
Lil Wayne, Lil, Drake, I ain't bout dat fucking biz.

I'm bout my count up, I let the hood ride.
Ain't stopping til my car goes running suicide.
I keep my count up and turn the hate down.
Like volume in the ride, they pumping brakes now.
