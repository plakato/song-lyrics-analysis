Downtown Tonight Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

At the bottom of the well my wish is waiting its turn.
Like a pack of cigarettes I'm just waiting to burn.
Been uptown too long, I wanna go downtown tonight.
She don't even know it but my name's on her lips.
She got me kind of crazy just a swinging her hips.
I've been uptown too long, I wanna go downtown tonight.
I wanna go downtown tonight.
I wanna go downtown tonight.
My girl she loves the city when we do it just right.
She likes her kissy kissy, she won't put up a fight.
Says I've been uptown too long.
I wanna go downtown tonight.
I wanna go downtown tonight.
I wanna go downtown tonight.
I got everything I wanted, what more could you need.
Let's head back to the penthouse with them soft silky sheets.
We'll crawl in the bed, switch off the lights.
I've been downtown too long baby.
I'm gonna go back uptown tonight.
I've been downtown tonight.
I've been downtown tonight.
With a little bit of kiss and a little bit of bite babe.
I've been downtown tonight.
