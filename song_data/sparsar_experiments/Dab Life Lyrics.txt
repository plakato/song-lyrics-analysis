Dab Life Lyrics
by Bizarre.


Yeah.
Laced Blunts 3.
Shout out to Taylor Gang.
Weirdo.
Back in the lab.
My nigga Wiz.
You know we smoking.
Aye.

Laced blunts three boy I'm still smoking.
OG kush, straight from East Oakland.
My eyes redder than a firetruck.
You know we get high as fuck.
I'm a pill head, let's make it real clear.
I'm on molly, I've been rolling for a whole year.
Grams and half, I'm snorting quarter keys.
You ain't turned up, get the fuck from 'round me.
Boy, my blunts, they are super long.
No Reggie Miller, we be blowing super strong.
Boy I'm high as fuck.
No blunts, we dabbing it up.

We dabbing, we smoking.
We drinking, we popping.
We dabbing, we smoking.
We drinking, we popping.
We dabbing, we smoking.
We drinking, we popping.
We dabbing, we smoking.
We drinking, we popping.

I be puffing every day.
Rolling on the Mary J, I ain't got much to say.
Higher than a skyscraper.
All type of flavor, I be using no raw papers.
The weed I got is so strong.
Dab life, looking like Cheech and Chong.
Dab life, we be hitting dabs.
Smoking kush, we be popping tabs.
Have you ever had my brownie.
It'll have your face pounding.
Mushroom clouds, boy I'm screwing.
If you ain't dabbing, what the fuck is you doing.
