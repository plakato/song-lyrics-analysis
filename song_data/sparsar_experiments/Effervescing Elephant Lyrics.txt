Effervescing Elephant Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

An Effervescing Elephant, 
With, tiny eyes and great big trunk 
Once whispered to the tiny ear 
The ear of one inferior 
That by next June he'd die. Oh yeah 
Because. The tiger would roam 
The little one said: Oh, my goodness, I must stay at home 
And every time. I hear a growl 
I'll know the tiger's on the prowl 
And I'll be really safe. You know 
The elephant, he told me so. 
Everyone was nervy. Oh yeah 
And. The message was spread: 
To zebra mongoose and the dirty hippopotamus 
Who wallowed in the mud and chewed 
His. Spicy hippo-plankton food 
And tended to ignore the word 
Preferring to survey a herd, 
Of stupid water bison, oh yeah, 
And. All the jungle took fright, 
And ran around for all the day and the night 
But all in vain, because you see 
The tiger came and said Who me 
You know I wouldn't hurt, not one of you 
I'd much prefer something to chew: 
And you're, all too scant.. Oh yeah 
He ate the Elephant
