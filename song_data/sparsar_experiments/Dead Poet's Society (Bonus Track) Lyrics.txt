Dead Poet's Society (Bonus Track) Lyrics
by Sweetness.


My journey started where the sidewalk ends 
Falling up. I saw the airwaves bend 
Imagination personified. I made it my friend 
No west side story, but I was raised on the West End: 
The 90's movement. The Mozart Effect that made me transcend 
My creative touch is the farthest thing from a trend 
But to talk about the simple things: that's a little bizarre 
Where we at now, if can't answer what we are 
So advanced, but still simple, like the apes that got too Far 
…in My natural selection for the right beats and words like Charles Darwin. 
This life is my movie and y'all, just co-starring 
Been trying to lead my people to the promise land, 
My, flow's rough and there's no-parting 
All these born sinners and our perceived needs for no-pardons 
Born into the socioeconomic status. Is it really our destiny, 
So dichotomized, but everyone holds a piece of divinity 
Like. It was really us that put the “Us” in geez 
Vicariously. We were conceived 
Like the cross of cavalry carved from The Giving Tree 
Can. You see the green like the Big 3 
Primetime religions, like Islam, Judaism and Christianity, 
Preaching blood,
