C Run Run Lyrics
by Two Crown King.


I'M going to take what I can get when I can get it while there's more 
I push the funk at family functions. It. Never let me down before 
Well you can supersede the pretext. Plus no one's keeping score. 
We can blame it on the weekend or just drink and 
\- work it all out on the floor. 
 
Refrain,

, { C run run } 
Now. Do we walk? Do we run? Do we roll? Do we tip-toe? Do we? Do we strut 
 { C, run, run } 
Now? Do we walk? Do we run? Do we roll? Do we tip-toe, do we? Do we strut 
, { C run, run } 
So? Do we walk? Do we run? Do we roll? Do we tip-toe do we? Do we strut 
 { C, run, run } 
Now? Do we walk? Do we run? Do we roll? Do we tip-toe, do we? Do we strut do
we, stroll 
 
No need to calm this cling and clatter. P-p-pitter patter ever more 
Take a break from 9 to 5.? It doesn't mind it., It holds the door 
Full on homestyle living backyard, fixing stretching chores 
\- or we could ride this train'till morning, still not knowing 
\-, where it stops or what's in store, 
 
Refrain, 
 
Do we walk. Do we run? Do we strut? Do we stroll Do we tip-toe 
Yeahh 
Do, we walk, Do we run, Do we strut? Do we stroll Do we tip-toe 
Yeahh,

, { C run run } 
Now? Do we walk? Do we run? Do we roll? Do we tip-toe? Do we? Do we strut 
 { C, run, run } 
Now? Do we walk? Do we run? Do we roll? Do we tip-toe, do we? Do we strut 
, { C run, run } 
So? Do we walk? Do we run? Do we roll? Do we tip-toe do we? Do we strut 
 { C, run, run } 
Now? Do we walk? Do we run? Do we roll do we tip-toe? Do we ...
