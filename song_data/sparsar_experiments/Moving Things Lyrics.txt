Moving Things Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

Baby baby get up what 
You'e already late for work 
What time. Is it Its 10 30 
Oh yeah? I forgot tonight, I'm working the graveyard 
 
I know my man is moving things 
9 to 5 baby. I got a job baby, 
I hope. One day my nigga change 
All the time baby, I'm on the grind baby 
 
I keeps that 9. In my drawers cuz, you know I like to ball 
Nigga. I ain't Warren G, but sometimes I want it all 
Flip a half into a whole. I mean an ounce into a brick 
Get it for sixteen five me and my niggas gon na be rich 
Put them 20's on my Benz, so you know I got so mens 
Keep your eyes on your enemies and nigga watch your friends 
See in this game. You get schisted, I get some niggas that don't like me, 
See the Ghettos trying to kill me and the feds wan na indict me 
On a murder. I didn't do I'm still thuggin with the crew 
Because once you snitch, then you threw. But if u hustle, then you true 
Would you live for this shit. Would you die for the click 
Sell, your soul, to get rich and run your mouth like a bitch, 
 
Nigga we hustle the streets so lets fuck the police, 
My enemies. Don'T want to see a nigga up on his feet. 
I got the chrome for the haters and burbs on the table. 
Give my life for my niggas and we splittin the paper. 
They say thuggin is the secret that help a nigga fall 
OZ's flippin quickly to see we never fall. 
The grind got us strapped with 9's on our lap. 
The crime is a trap. Chop dimes of crack. 
Hennesy got your mind. If you slip, you might die 
Penitentiaries. Give us time I'm fighting for mine 
If. I die in this game, send my soul to God 
I'm making mine in this game, even though it's so hard, 
, 
Yo, baby guess who stopped by today, who guess 
Your sister came from California, mnn mnnnn. 
I ain't got time for all this guessin. I just got home from work 
Come on. I want you to guess. We gon na play a game. 
Your auntee from Jersey, mnn, mnn, wrong, again, 
Who, The mother, fucking ATF. That'S who 
What? Yes, you know what I'm saying. 
What you running them games on me, 
You, let them in the house 
Hell ya. What am I supposed to do? I didn't know what to do. 
They wanted to search the house and if they find some 
Mother fucking dope in here, they are gon na. Take my children 
Away, and I can't be having that shit. Man slow down slow down, 
Slow down, slow down, ima, slow down, ima, slow down, 
You know what I'm tired of this shit and another thing. 
I called your mother fucking work today and guess what they told me. 
You haven't been to work in the last 6 months, 
Now what you been doing, huh 
How, the fuck. You think you get all this shit. You have 
I, don't know how I get it.. You tell me that's what I want to know. 
You don't want it. Tell me where you get it from 
Don't play with me. You know what happening 
Hmm. Hmm, I know. What'S happening., you know what 
I don't want this shit. Fuck it all. Fuck it all
