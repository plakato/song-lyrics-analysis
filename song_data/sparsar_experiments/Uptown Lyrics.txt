Uptown Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

Taxi.
Did you call a taxi?
Master P:.
Yea.
Taxi:.
Where you going my brother?
Master P:.
Uptown. Ya heard me Calliope 36-49 go cross the Broad.

I'll be hangin' uptown.
With my niggas.
Yea Yea Yea Yea Yea.

Uptown baby, don't clown baby.
It's going down baby, I'm with my rounds baby.
Uptown CP3, nigga my block stay hot.
Erato and Dorgenois, nigga I got it on lock.
From the Mac to the Melph to the Calliope.
Nigga in the bricks at night fool anything goes.
Rose Tavern is the spot were I stash the Glock.
Hoody Hoo, Run Forest here comes the cops.
Nigga second line fast when my peeps get killed.
R.I.P. T-shirts nigga to remember the real.
Sam Skulley got killed and Big Glen got knifed.
My lil cousin Jimmy did 8.
But now he's trying to change his life.

Now let me take you to the land of the choppers.
Pussy poppers and body droppers.
Crooked cops and quarter shops.
When the cop shopper.
You get your hands on a a bird.
Don't say a word.
There's a million coke spots with no coke to serve.
Ain't that that nerve.
When you see them nigga swerve in they Lexus.
And you can't get no bus pass.
To get your ski mask, and get a clique.
But make sure it niggas you been fucking with.
Get a bitch who bout that murder, murder and sucking dick.
On the slick doe, cause they pulling kickdoes.
And I think it was them nigga out that Thomas.
Cause they had them black rags and bombers.
But you ain't hear that me, I can't talk, I can't see.

Ain't that how a nigga be.
I be on GT with Wiz and Boo.
When them fucking people spin in, my niggas holla OOP OOP.
And if a nigga find ya, we second line behind ya.
Blow some ganja in your memory.
And sport your tee just to remind ya.
We still.

Now if you looking for me playa.
When I'm down in the city.
You wanna get with me then hit me.
Or come in that Calliope and get me.
For real ask Juan and Ize.
I be down in the cut.
Me, Boo, Gio, and Teedy.
We be tearing shit up.
Them my rounds, uptown them tough guys on the block.
Just like Slim and Marcelo.
They got that Nolia on lock.
And that Rose Tavern.
I'm chillling right in front of Randall picture.
They hit cha but ask Victor.
We gon' always be with cha.
I let Lil Cory tell a story while he down in the 5th.
I hit the spliff, pass the tweet and yell CP3.
We make a move and bounce to House of Blues.
Full of tequila, we left the daiquiri shop.
Them po po's sweating the block.
And now it's back to the Calliope.

The driveway in the middle of Dorgenois Court.
I represent it lil daddy.
Cause it's a Calliope thing.
And uptown is the place where I chill and hang.
