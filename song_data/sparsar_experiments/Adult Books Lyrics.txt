Adult Books Lyrics
by X.

Many many guys and girls.
All real beauties.
Everybody making a stab.
They hurt themselves.

Singles rule the world.
Feeding on fresh blood.
One track eye.
Below the belt.

All in a line.
All in a line.
They're all in a line.
Like adult books.
I don't understand.
Jackie Susann meant it that way.
Adult books.
I don't understand.
Jackie Susann meant it that way.

Clifford shackles Jane.
Throws her on the floor.
She says, No... no... YES.
And he cuts the chains.

Do plenty people go for Tomata?
Yes, but he just goes for that special girl.
Who says, NO.

All in a line.
All in a line.
They're all in a line.
Like adult books.
I don't understand.
Jackie Susann meant it that way.
Adult books.
I don't understand.
Jackie Susann meant it that way.
