Act Accordingly Lyrics
by Woodie.

YOU COMIN' AT ME WRONG, I'M COMIN' BACK AT CHA.
WE CAN TAKE TEN STEPS, SEE WHO DRAWS FASTER.
PUT IT ON THE LINE KILLA, FUCK SPEAKIN' YOUR MIND KILLA.
I AIN'T GOT THE TIME, PISTOL WHIP YA' WIT MY NINE MILLA.
SKIP ALL THE BULLSHIT THAT'S COMIN OUT YOUR LIPS.
YOU WANNA KILL ME THEN KILL ME 'CAUSE I AIN'T EASY TO MISS.
I'M RIGHT THERE AT THE STOPLIGHT SWIGGIN' ON A FORTY.
STILL LIVIN' THRU THAT YOC LIFE LATE NIGHT-EARLY MORNING.
IN TRAFFIC WITH MY HOMIE LIL' BIRD SITTIN' PASSENGER.
EYES PEELED FOR ENEMIEZ AS WE HIT AND PASS THE HERB.
BENDIN' DIFFERENT CORNERS FROM CHICO TO CONTRA COSTA.
YOU LOOKIN' LIKE YOU KNOW ME, 4 FINGERS WHAT I TOSS YA'.
I TRAVEL THROUGH THIS LIFE WITH A CHIP ON BOTH SHOULDERS.
THOUGHT I WAS DONE AT TWENTY-ONE BUT I KEEP GETTIN' OLDER.
I'LL SOAK IN ALL I CAN AND LET MY WISDOM EXPAND.
PLAY MY CARDS RIGHT AND I MIGHT GET THAT MILLION IN MY HAND.

GOD I KNOW SHIT COULD BE WORSE.
BUT THIS LIQUOR DOESN'T QUENCH MY THIRST.
YOU TOOK TWO BROTHERS AND A SISTER FROM MY LIFE.
BUT I AIN'T MAD, I JUST HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
POLICE SAY FOREVER SNOOP'S LOCKED DOWN.
HE'S INNOCENT, YOU CAN ASK THE YOCTOWN.
IDO MY BEST TO BE HUMBLE AS I CAN BE.
BUT SOMETIMES I GOTTA ACT ACCORDINGLY.

THIS ROAD I CHOSE IN LIFE IS FILLED WITH PAIN AND STRIFE.
WILL I TAKE A LIFE? KILL TO GAIN A STRIPE?
YES..IT'S NOTHIN' NEW I'LL TELL YA' THAT MUCH.
AND I'LL NEVER BREAK PROTOCAL TO MAKE A FAST BUCK.
'CAUSE I'M STUCK AND BOUND FOR LIFE TO HOMEBOYZ I'VE GROWN WITH.
AMONGST EACH OTHER WE FIND LOVE TO DEAL WITH THE COLDNESS.
THAT THIS WORLD CAN BRING AND TRUST ME IT PACKS A STING.
WHEN YOUR BROTHER GETS MURDERED WHO WAS FIT TO BE A KING.
AND THEY WONDER WHERE WE LEARN TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS WITH VIOLENCE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE GOVERNMENT, IT AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT TYRANTS.
YEAH THE EVENING NEWS GOT THE WEAK BLIND FOLDED.
BUT DIG A LITTLE DEEPER AND YOU'LL SEE WHY I'M HOLDIN'.
A PISTOL ON MY PERSON, STACKIN' CHOPS IN THE CUTS.
I FEEL THAT YOU DESERVE TO DIE IF IN THE COPS YOU TRUST.
I ADMIT MY SOUL IS TAINTED BUT THAT DON'T MEAN I AIN'T RIGHT.
THIS WORLD'S ABOUT TO SAY GOODNIGHT, I WON'T LAY DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

TELL ME WHY WE LIVIN' LORD, YOU JUST GONNA KILL US ANYWAY.
WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE JUST KEPT US IN HEAVEN SINCE THE VERY FIRST DAY.
TELL ME WHY WE LIVIN' LORD, YOU KNOW WE GONNA FALL A STRAY.
THIS WORLD IS FULL OF EVILNESS, BUT FUCK IT, WHATEVER YOU SAY.

LET MY PISTOL PROTECT.

THIS WORLD IS FULL OF MISERY, IT'S QUITE A TWISTED GAME YOU PLAY.

I'M STILL ON THIS EARTH I GUESS I HAVEN'T ACCOMPLISHED.
MY MISSION BUT IT'S HARD WHEN YOU'RE WALKIN' UNCONSCIOUS.
I'M JUST TRYNA DEAL deal WITH THE PAIN with the pain.
GET A COUPLE MIL mil FOR THE GANG for the gang.
EVERYTHING IS HARDER THAN IT SEEMS.
I'VE SEEN ALOT OF PEOPLE GIVE UP AND STOP FOLLOWIN' THEIR DREAMS.
I CANNOT ALLOW MYSELF TO FALL VICTIM TO THE SAME CURSE.
SOMETIMES TO ACHIEVE YOU GOTTA PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER.
BUT BE WARY OF STRANGERS, KEEP ONE IN THE CHAMBER.
AND REACT WITH YOUR BRAIN, DON'T REACT OUTTA ANGER.
THEY CALL US GANGBANGERS, MORE LIKE STREET SOLDIERS.
WE SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S WHY THEY HOLD US.
LOCKED DOWN IN PRISONS, POLITICAL DECISIONS.
DECIDED BY THE WEALTHY WITH EVIL AND GREEDY VISIONS.
THEY GOT THE LAWS WRITTEN WHERE MONEY TALKS, SO PEOPLE SELL THEIR SOUL.
TO GET A PIECE OF THE PIE, I'D RATHER DIE IN THE COLD.
