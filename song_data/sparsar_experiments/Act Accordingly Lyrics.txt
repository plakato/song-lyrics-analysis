Act Accordingly Lyrics
by Woodie.

You COMIN' AT ME WRONG. I'M COMIN' BACK AT CHA 
WE CAN TAKE TEN STEPS, SEE WHO DRAWS FASTER 
PUT IT ON THE LINE. Killa FUCK SPEAKIN' YOUR MIND: KILLA 
I, AI N'T GOT THE TIME PISTOL WHIP YA' WIT, MY NINE MILLA 
SKIP, ALL THE BULLSHIT. That'S COMIN OUT YOUR LIPS, 
YOU WAN NA KILL ME THEN KILL ME'CAUSE. I AI N'T EASY TO MISS 
I'M RIGHT THERE AT THE STOPLIGHT SWIGGIN' ON A FORTY 
STILL LIVIN' THRU THAT YOC LIFE LATE NIGHT-EARLY MORNING, 
IN TRAFFIC WITH MY HOMIE LIL' BIRD SITTIN' PASSENGER 
EYES, PEELED FOR ENEMIEZ AS WE HIT AND PASS THE HERB 
BENDIN' DIFFERENT CORNERS FROM Chico TO CONTRA COSTA 
YOU LOOKIN', LIKE YOU, KNOW ME, 4 FINGERS WHAT I TOSS. Ya' 
I TRAVEL THROUGH THIS LIFE WITH A CHIP ON BOTH SHOULDERS 
THOUGHT. I WAS DONE AT TWENTY-ONE, BUT I KEEP GETTIN' OLDER 
I'LL SOAK IN ALL. I CAN AND LET MY WISDOM EXPAND. 
Play MY CARDS RIGHT AND I MIGHT GET THAT MILLION IN MY HAND, 
 
GOD, I KNOW SHIT, COULD BE WORSE. 
But. This LIQUOR DOES N'T QUENCH MY THIRST. 
You TOOK TWO BROTHERS AND A SISTER FROM MY LIFE 
BUT, I AI N'T MAD. I JUST HOPE, YOU'RE RIGHT, 
POLICE, SAY FOREVER SNOOP'S LOCKED DOWN, 
HE'S INNOCENT. You CAN ASK THE YOCTOWN 
IDO MY BEST TO BE HUMBLE, AS I CAN BE 
BUT. Sometimes I GOT TA ACT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
THIS ROAD I CHOSE IN LIFE IS FILLED WITH PAIN AND STRIFE 
WILL. I TAKE A LIFE KILL TO GAIN A STRIPE. 
Yes..It'S NOTHIN' NEW I'LL, TELL YA' THAT MUCH 
AND I'LL, NEVER BREAK PROTOCAL TO MAKE A FAST BUCK 
'CAUSE I'M STUCK AND BOUND FOR LIFE TO HOMEBOYZ I'VE GROWN WITH 
AMONGST EACH OTHER. We FIND LOVE TO DEAL WITH THE COLDNESS 
THAT THIS WORLD CAN BRING AND TRUST ME. It PACKS A STING 
WHEN. Your BROTHER GETS MURDERED. Who WAS FIT TO BE A KING 
AND. They WONDER WHERE WE LEARN TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS WITH VIOLENCE. 
Take A LOOK AT THE GOVERNMENT, IT AI N'T NOTHIN', BUT TYRANTS 
YEAH THE EVENING NEWS GOT THE WEAK BLIND FOLDED. 
But DIG A LITTLE DEEPER AND YOU'LL SEE WHY I'M HOLDIN' 
A PISTOL ON MY PERSON, STACKIN' CHOPS IN THE CUTS 
I FEEL THAT YOU DESERVE TO DIE. If, IN THE COPS, YOU TRUST 
I ADMIT MY SOUL IS TAINTED, BUT THAT DO N'T MEAN I AI N'T RIGHT, 
THIS WORLD'S ABOUT TO SAY GOODNIGHT, I WO N'T LAY DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT 
 
TELL ME WHY WE LIVIN' LORD YOU JUST GON NA KILL US ANYWAY. 
Why COULD N'T. You HAVE JUST KEPT US IN HEAVEN SINCE THE VERY FIRST DAY. 
Tell ME WHY WE LIVIN' LORD, YOU KNOW WE GON NA FALL. A STRAY 
THIS WORLD IS FULL OF EVILNESS, BUT FUCK IT. Whatever YOU SAY, 
 
LET, MY PISTOL, PROTECT, 
 
THIS WORLD IS FULL OF MISERY. It'S QUITE A TWISTED GAME. You PLAY 
 
I'M STILL ON THIS EARTH. I GUESS I HAVE N'T ACCOMPLISHED 
MY MISSION, BUT IT'S HARD WHEN YOU'RE WALKIN' UNCONSCIOUS 
I'M JUST TRYNA DEAL deal WITH THE PAIN with the pain 
GET. A COUPLE MIL mil FOR THE GANG for the gang 
EVERYTHING IS HARDER THAN IT SEEMS. 
I'Ve SEEN ALOT OF PEOPLE GIVE UP AND STOP FOLLOWIN' THEIR DREAMS. 
I CAN NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO FALL VICTIM TO THE SAME CURSE. 
Sometimes. To ACHIEVE YOU GOT TA PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER. 
But BE WARY OF STRANGERS. Keep ONE IN THE CHAMBER. 
And REACT WITH YOUR BRAIN. Do N'T REACT, OUTTA, ANGER, 
THEY CALL US GANGBANGERS MORE, LIKE STREET SOLDIERS, 
WE SCARE, THE SHIT OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT. That'S WHY THEY HOLD US 
LOCKED DOWN IN PRISONS, POLITICAL DECISIONS 
DECIDED BY THE WEALTHY, WITH EVIL AND GREEDY VISIONS. 
They GOT THE LAWS WRITTEN WHERE MONEY TALKS. So PEOPLE SELL THEIR SOUL 
TO GET A PIECE OF THE PIE. I'D RATHER DIE IN THE COLD
