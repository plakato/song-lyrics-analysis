Clear Fang Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


I woke up real early cus I'm ready to smoke now.
Hit up my homie like nigga lets smoke now.
Few minutes later in the car can we roll now.
Hit the store nigga do we got what we need now.
Backwood rolled it full of the tree can we smoke now.
Headed to a spot where the girls be smokin' now.
Saw this 'lil bitch that I used to be scopin' out.
Till I found out she was trifling, threw her out.

She look back at me, then she said to me.
Can I hit your weed, your weed, your weed?

And hell to the nah is what i told the bitch.
You just got done suckin' on some niggas dick.
I don't give a damn if you brushed your teeth since.
Ho get you some money then go buy your own shit.
All my niggas work hard for their own shit.
Beat a nigga ass if he wanna start shit.
I be on a plane and a boat and a spaceship.
Higher than a motherfucking bill for a face-lift.
Fuck with me nigga i'll get you a face-lift.
Hollow Squad mobbin comin through just to wreck shit.
I deserve none but all the respect quick.
I be with my blade, you be scared, I ain't scared of shit.
Coward ass fools they be shaking while talking shit.
Catch a damn grip before you catch you a grave bitch.
All you rap niggas wack, can't understand this.
Im gonna get up off the floor and conquer, destruction.
