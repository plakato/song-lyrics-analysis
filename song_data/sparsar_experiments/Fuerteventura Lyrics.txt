Fuerteventura Lyrics
by Russian Red.

You're always such a fool.
And in your eyes so blue.
I see the life I never had before.

Do you remember when.
We used to live things separate.
We hadn't met or thought.
That could be possible.

I'm glad you had your life.
So good to listen to your past.
All of those things brought you.
With me and now we're two.

You're always such a fool.
And in your eyes so blue.
I see the life I never had before.
You always talk so smooth.
And in your voice, so true.
I hear the dream.
I never had before.

But if I try to think.
Of something better than this.
Heaven comes down.
And reminds the luck we live.

You're always such a fool.
And in your eyes so blue.
I see the life I never had before.
You always talk so smooth.
And in your voice, so true.
I hear the dream.
I never had before.
