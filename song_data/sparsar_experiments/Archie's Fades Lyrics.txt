Archie's Fades Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.


Your face is down alone on your desk.
At the end of the city you were squashed into.
There is no one you love.

The quivering heart of Gigantor.
The quivering heart of Cory.

Your hair has gone white.
The truck you drive could easily crash into another and bigger truck.
It will be so long before I know.

The quivering heart of Gigantor.
The quivering heart of Cory.

Your harmonium plays a chord.
I can hear it and I can feel it.
Across all time and across all pain.

The quivering heart of Gigantor.
The quivering heart of Cory.
