Fly Away Lyrics
by Virtue.

Away, away, away.
Away, away, away.

Sitting here thinking how good You've been.
You blessed me all of my days, yes You did.
Yet I realize I haven't been, ooh, everything You want me to be, yeah.
But if You take me, I'm more than willing to go, I wanna fly away with You.

I wanna fly away with You, I wanna soar like eagles do.
I lay aside every weight as I look to the sky.

I wanna fly away with You.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I can wait to see where You gonna lead mne oh what joy will I find.
You've treasured me I love you eternally and peac to ease my mine.
So if You call me, I'll answer You with all of my heart, I wanna fly away with.
You.

I wanna fly away with You.
I wanna soar like eagles do.
I lay aside every weight  as I look to the sky.

I wanna fly away with You.

So when You call me, I'll answer You with all of my heart.
I wanna fly away with You.
I wanna soar like eagles do.
I lay aside every weight as I look to the sky.

I wanna fly away with You.
Away, away, away.
Away, away, away.
I wanna fly away with You.
