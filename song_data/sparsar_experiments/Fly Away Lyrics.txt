Fly Away Lyrics
by Woodie.


Malicious entities hell sent 
Try to rip my soul from my flesh. 
Paralyzed can't move my body. Where do God be 
As? I lay strugglin' for breath. 
 
My body motionless eyes, open 
Hoping. This isn't my chosen death 
At. The moment I thought my life was over. 
Whatever was holdin' me suddenly left 
, 
Bye, bye, .... Why I ... didn't die 
I, can't answer: why try 
I'm busy fightin' inner demons 
Nightly and daily Prayin'? I die high 
 
Tryin' to keep possession of my sanity. 
Don'T want to admit life's damaged me 
Got to keep it together for family 
Often. Wonder if God's abandoned me, 
 
Streets got me grippin' heat randomly 
Hopin', nobody tests, the man in me 
If. I feel any ill-fated plans for me. 
I will try to peel your canopy 
 
In. My wicked mind lies a gifted mind 
Intelligent but inflicted mind 
Saturated with depicted crimes 
Livin' in apocalyptic times, 
 
Time to get the f*ck up out of here. 
Like county jail after about a year 
F*ck the police state. It loud and clear 
For every citizen, they murder without a tear, 
 
Maybe, I'm slightly psychotic 
And. My mentality goes unshared 
So. If I'm wrong, let me know, hit the rum 
Light, the blunt blaze, your gun in the air 
 
Karma's like Medusa. She can turn you to stone 
Raised in a world where I been cursed. Since the first day I was born, 
I pray, pray, I wake up knowin', I might die today. 
It'S murder day wish. I could pack up and just fly away. 
 
Like, I'm I'm constantly dead 
Talkin' about all these darkness's 
But, my consciousness, 
Through most of it 
I'm cursed, 
, 
The, burners near 
, 
I didn't ask for this 
But. The sad shit is 
Admiration. Here I just play with 
 
I, don't fake! This shit 
 still countin' down the days 
I hear what I be fearin' is up in the mirror: 
I'm seeing reruns moving in sequence, 
 
Asking Jesus. Can you please once 
Ease up and let me breath once 
I got uh struggle just to keep up 
Grew up in the streets? 
 
Is it the good or is it the evil 
Living illegal? So how could it be good 
Could? It be demons where I be sleepin' 
Or. Is it the reaper tryin' to creep in ?
 
My movements are sinking 
What? Is it meaning? 
What is the reason 
The voices won't leave here, 
 
After, the deep shit 
You don't want to go there, especially sober 
Did evil. Take over, I can't even notice 
Used to be closer, but now that I'm older 
 
Keep losing my close ones. 
Lost of emotions 
They feel when the torture 
Will it ever be over 
 
Take this away from my shoulders 
 in the back of my mind, 
I could here what I told ya: 
 
Take this away from my shoulders 
 in the back of my mind, 
I Could here what I told ya, 
 
Karma's like Medusa? She can turn you to stone 
Raised in a world where I been cursed. Since the first day I was born, 
I pray, pray. I wake up knowin', I might die today, 
It's murder day wish. I could pack up and just fly away, 
 
In negative ways. I feel 
Someone call on the name: 
Hollerin' 
Like, a stumble, fumble rumble 
 
Havin', his closest disrespect, him 
Separated in parts 
Play with various riddles 
To be settled. 
 
Guardian angels were owing in time. 
Havin' me fall off: no, they one. Let him 
Embrace felt 
Glock get spelt. 
, 
, 
Wigs, get pelt, 
 melt, 
 asphalt, 
Aluminum welt, 
, 
 45 caliber 
For, not keeping your trap, sealed 
 
Smash, those that be fuckin' with your ched 
Harass. My voices in my head 
 
 to kill them dead 
Coming out, like 
Extension by lead 
When. I flash 
 calling cold dread. 
 
Time be tickin', 
My kind, 
Funk, sickin' 
Walking through light 
 
Questioning, your palms, while they drippin' 
Unchangeable unexplainable 
In uh rage, not written 
 to the oath 
 
 forever infected cursed within me, 
 
Karma's, like Medusa. She can turn you to stone 
Raised in a world where I been cursed. Since the first day I was born, 
I pray pray, I wake up knowin', I might die today. 
It'S murder day wish. I could pack up and just fly away.
