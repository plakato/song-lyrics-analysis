Big, crib out west full house, 
Ace of Spades, King of Diamonds, full house, 
Bet big out in Vegas full house 
Bunch of white girls getting faded. This a full house, 
 
I, told her girlfriend “what you about ”, 
Bitch, so bad. I can't pull out 
I, be throwing up my hood when I hit it from the back. 
She got lil titties, but her ass, real fat 
My bitch better than your bitch 
My homie fucking. She ain't your bitch 
I call my bitches over 
Your girl, ain't, real, my bitches know: 
 
Uh. I just got off the plane form France, 
My white bitches, say “you're, the man” 
My hood bitches call me Cam 
Pussy poppin' on a hand, stand 
Big, crib, that's a full house! 
Quentin Tarantino, I'm pulling them foreign's out. 
Bougie-Bitches drinkin' red wine 
I'm just smoking, trappin tryna make my dead line 
Only there for 12 hours, then I'm back to the trap, 
South of France and I'm smoking on Pat 
Seen, a yacht that was motivation, 
New Porsche, that's for baking, kush and rotation, 
 
Got, a Full house so my whole team straight 
Taking shots of Bombay and bitch. I need eight 
All. These show dates. There'S no way we can't win 
Booked some Nine's in your city, bitch. We need 10's 
Don't hit my check with that fuck shit, 
Four queens with me and all the bitches ready to function. 
So. That means that I got two-pair 
Take, a L tell her “Baby come back bitch, I'm two player” 
Ace-of-spades stuffing King Cones 
All. These bae's won't leave me alone. Full house won't be alone 
Hold up holding its holding like Hold'em 
Got, a Royal-Flush, so there's no way that I'm folding 
 
Wooh 
What up Jace 
I, see you nigga 
 
You told me. You been turned up all day right, 
Let's get it 
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey
