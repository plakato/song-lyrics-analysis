Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.

Oh really.
You gon' forward my call Sy.
I know you got your phone with you.
You don't answer when I call.
But every time I'm with you that phone stay in your face.
I know you got your phone with you pick up the phone.
You with one of lame bitches huh.
Ok cool, its cool.
See if I really needed something that'd be fucked up.
I'm sick of this shit man.
You better call me when you get this voicemail.
Bye nigga.

You ain't got to act out so other women would know.
I told you things that only my niggas'll know.
Say you hear its like you not listening though.
And shit was all good 5 minutes ago.
I look high but keep a lot of shit on the low.
Cause ain't nothing sweet but a cinnamon roll.
Them other hoes saying Sy get it and go.
We only want to hit the scene when y'all tripping at home.
So stop tripping at home.
Cause you forgot this is your home.
This shit crazy.
Ya, a whole lot changed in about 5 minutes.
5, 5.
Told you I'm cutting off all my bitches.
I ain't nothing like my niggas girl I promise.
Just don't tell 'em that I said that.
Just don't think that I'm dishonest.
I don't want no one else.
It seem like you don't want heaven.
And I can't say fuck you.
Its no one I'd run to.
I know I love you for sure.

Hello.
