Roll Roll Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

Ain't no block too hot.
Me and my niggas bout to open up shop.
Hot boy nigga grab the Glock.
So me and my niggas we can sell our rocks.
Ain't no block too hot.
Me and my niggas bout to open up shop.
Hot boy nigga grab the Glock.
So me and my niggas we can sell our rocks.

Master P.
Every bag of that raw.
We hustle in the park.
From dusk to dawn nigga.
From dawn to dark.
Now if you tweakin, boy.
You better be creepin.
But if you beefin, nigga.
You bout to be sleepin.
Me and my dogs.
We don't fuck with you cats.
Go to the pen.
Don't fuck with no rats.
See this shit is real.
I sleep with one eye open.
See in the ghetto.
Niggas gotta be pistol totin.
A thousand fuckin' grams.
That's what I'm workin' with.
Come short on the D.
You know what you twerkin' wit.
It's murder, 187.
I represent the third ward.
We tote mac 11's.
If I die, write my name in the sky.
My niggas bust yo' ass.
Yall gon' know why.

Roll roll roll ya dough.
Up and down the street.
On the first and fifteenth you don't have my money.
Me and my boys we gon' bring that heat.

Krazy.
It's a problem.
I ain't get my hands dirty wit ya.
??? gon' come get ya.
Chopper split ya.
A young soldier.
Plottin' to rule the world with riches.
Ask P to use this Hummer so I can fuck some bitches.
Run the block all week.
Trying to dodge the cops.
Niggas prayin' on my death before my album drops.
My niggas wearin wires.
Feds tappin' my phone.
Send a check to IRS so they can leave me alone.
Told my dog believe you we can rule the world.
He didn't listen.
He'd rather stuff his nose with furl.
They found him dead in the project.
Brains on the ground.
When you a fiend.
That's the way the game go down.

Mystikal.
I'm from the ? chopper too!
Come fuckin' around wit me ain't no tellin' what I'ma do!
Put my foot so far up yo' ass I'd probably lose my shoe!
That nigga chokin!
Motherfucker coughin' up blood.
Well fuck the Heimlich maneuver.
You don't want that drama to come to you!
Yo' mama to come do you!
Cuz HOT IRON will run ya through ya!
You and yo' dudes don't be around cuz you'll catch a contact.
If you ain't got beef wit a nigga.
Don't be 'round beef.
You won't be on yo' back.

Silkk.
Oh it ain't my fault.
We'll dead these niggas.
Can't move we infrared these niggas.
We'll do these niggas.
Black proof these niggas.
Close casket these boys.
Black suit these niggas.
We'll blast these niggas.
Walk past these niggas.
And ride on these bustas.
Just keep mashin these niggas.
And after we do it.
We'll toss the tec.
And ghetto.
Plus I know not else but to fuckin' floss the set.
You ain't gotta ask who's hot.
Who's on top.
I gotta question to ask yall foreal.
Tru or not.
If I got two guns.
I'm sure one gon' bust.
If I got two niggas wildin' out.
When I bust, one gon' duck.
The one that's wildin' the most.
That's the one I'ma bust.
He still trippin' after that.
I'ma give him two cuz he don't think one was enough.
