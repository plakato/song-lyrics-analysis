Roll Roll Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

Ain'T no block too hot 
Me and my niggas bout to open up shop, 
Hot boy, nigga, grab the Glock 
So me and my niggas. We can sell our rocks 
Ain't no block too hot 
Me and my niggas bout to open up shop. 
Hot boy nigga grab the Glock 
So me and my niggas. We can sell our rocks 
 
Master, P, 
Every bag of that raw 
We hustle in the park, 
From dusk, to dawn, nigga, 
From dawn to dark 
Now. If you tweakin boy, 
You, better, be creepin 
But. If you beefin nigga 
You bout to be sleepin 
Me and my dogs, 
We, don't fuck with you cats 
Go to the pen, 
Don't fuck, with no rats 
See. This shit is real. 
I sleep with one eye open 
See in the ghetto 
Niggas got ta, be pistol. Totin 
A thousand fuckin' grams 
That's. What I'm workin' with 
Come short on the D 
You know what you twerkin' wit, 
It's murder. 187 
I represent the third ward 
We tote mac 11's 
If. I die write my name in the sky. 
My niggas bust yo', ass, 
Yall gon' know why 
 
Roll roll roll ya, dough, 
Up and down the street 
On the first and fifteenth you don't have my money 
Me and my boys. We gon' bring that heat, 
 
Krazy 
It's a problem. 
I ain't get my hands dirty wit, ya, 
 gon', come get ya; 
Chopper split ya, 
A young soldier 
Plottin' to rule the world with riches; 
Ask P, to use this Hummer. So I can fuck some bitches 
Run the block all week, 
Trying to dodge the cops 
Niggas prayin' on my death. Before my album drops, 
My niggas wearin wires, 
Feds tappin', my phone 
Send a check to IRS, so they can leave me alone 
Told. My dog believe you. We can rule the world 
He, didn't listen, 
He'd rather stuff. His nose with furl 
They found him dead in the project 
Brains on the ground. 
When you a fiend 
That's, the way the game go down: 
 
Mystikal 
I'm from the chopper too 
Come fuckin'. Around wit. Me ain't no tellin' what I'ma do 
Put my foot so far up yo' ass I'd probably lose my shoe 
That nigga chokin 
Motherfucker coughin' up blood, 
Well fuck, the Heimlich maneuver 
You. Don'T want that drama to come to you 
Yo' mama to come. Do you 
Cuz HOT IRON will run ya through ya, 
You and yo' dudes don't be around cuz you'll catch a contact 
If! You ain't got beef wit, a nigga, 
Don't be'round beef 
You won't be on yo' back 
 
Silkk 
Oh. It ain't my fault, 
We'll dead. These niggas 
Can't move. We infrared these niggas 
We'll. Do these niggas 
Black proof these niggas 
Close casket these boys 
Black suit these niggas 
We'll blast these niggas 
Walk past these niggas 
And ride on these bustas 
Just keep mashin these niggas 
And after we do it 
We'll toss the tec, 
And ghetto 
Plus, I know not else, But to fuckin' floss the set 
You ain't got ta ask who's hot 
Who's on top 
I got ta question to ask yall foreal, 
Tru or not 
If. I got two guns, 
I'm sure one gon' bust 
If. I got two niggas wildin' out 
When I bust one gon' duck 
The one: that's wildin' the most 
That's, the one I'ma bust, 
He, still trippin' after that 
I'ma give him two cuz. He don't think one was enough.
