Can't Stand Still (Live) Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Well, I remember the day that it ended, it was a scene that I never intended.
My heart just hasn't been mended from that day on.
You looked at me so sadly, you said I treated you badly.
You said you want something madly, but now it's gone.

Well baby, when, when, when I was in a rock 'n' roll band and I was playin' a.
one night stand.
And I said I wanna be your man and it was fine.
The situation is jaded and it's a crime.

But T said that we hadn't made it, although so invaded.
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I gotta move.
And don't you know that I just can't stand still for a minute, too many.
memories ended.
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I gotta move, oh oh, go Eddie, go.
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, too many memories ended.

Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I got to move.
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I gotta move.

Well, you know that I just can't stand still for a minute, baby, too many.
memories ended.

Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, oh no no, too many memories ended.
Well, I always been a long gone ember for my love that I always remember.
Because I know deep down in my soul, it's a feelin' that I'll never control.
You know it ended up bleed out December, I never forget, no I never forget.

I'll just keep playin' my rock 'n' roll and I'll make it there.
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I got to move.
Well, you know that I just can't stand still for a minute, too many memories.
ended.
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, baby, too many memories ended.
Oh, I just can't stand still for a minute, I got to move.
Oh, I just can't stand still for a minute, I got to move.
Baby, well, why you treat me so bad, I can't stand it anymore.
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute.
Pack all my bags and get the hell outta town, yeah.
