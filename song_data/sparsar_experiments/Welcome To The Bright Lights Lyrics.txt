Welcome To The Bright Lights Lyrics
by Tyler Casey.

Welcome to the bright lights.
Sunglasses and Champagne Fights.
Fantastic asses make it rain all night.
Vegas rolling dice.
Boss calls the shots.
7 on the slots.
Money talks.
You know what walks.
Waitresses with no tops.
Serving me whiskey on the rocks.
LMFAO she's a tipsy fox.
Flirting with every guy that buys her a shot.
I can tell she past cocked glass just dropped.
She getting yelled at by her boss.
I tell him to stop.
He's a flat blob.
She's a heart throb.
So I approach this mistress and whisper in her ear.
Excuse me miss ya too fine to be working here.
Let me take you outta here.

She just wanna kick it, ride along be my side kick.
Maybe get on the red carpet.
Rock some fly kicks.
She says needs a diamond roc to shine.
Paper to spend that ain't mine.
And liquor to shoot straight, No chaser just limes.
Salt Lips, Salt Kiss.
Angelina, bad bitch, Mrs. Smith.
Movie Flicks,.
I beat the Odd's.
Now I money ball, Brad Pit.

Paper chasing 7 plus figures.
Cut the deal, no scissors.
Shooting shots to my liver.
Then we celebrate with some champagne that's chiller.
Welcome to the high life but no millers.
Just Reservations for 40/40 dinner's.
And If I were to Step on stage I'd have no jitters.
I deliver in the clutch, homerun hitter.
I love the pressure, the bigger.
The better, that's what she said.
Show I show the Bejamermaines.
Make it rain and sprinkler.
On a stripper, So she coming swimming, I'm too official.
T make it drizzle, so she just make that.
Jiggle jiggle jiggle.
