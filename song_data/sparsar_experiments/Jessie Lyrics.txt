Jessie Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

Jessie please don't go.
I know you hear me.
But words can't reach you now.
We had too far to go.
I know I'll miss you.
And time won't stop the feeling.

The softest voice is in my ear.
But must we share this memory?
The warm of your touch I cannot feel.
You leave me this way.

Jessie please don't go.
I know you hear me.
But words can't reach you now.
We had too far to go.
I know I'll miss you.
And time won't stop the feeling.

Forever knowing yesterday.
No time for time all gone away.
See you now in memory.
Saying goodbye.

Jessie please don't go.
I know you hear me.
But words can't reach you now.
We had too far to go.
I know I'll miss you.
And time won't stop the feeling.
