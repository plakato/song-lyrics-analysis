Venice Lockjaw Lyrics
by Women.

One more awful feeling.
And fog rotate.
Pelted on the second stair.
Blood falls from your vision.
Of an overdraw.
Don't pant and we'll go unseen.
Chirping birds.
Passed off an open glare.
Hung on a firework.
Bodies at once we were.
Torched by the burning sand.
Touched by a folded hand.
Ripped off in your marteau.
And matching walk.
Echoed in a crowded square.
Dragged into submission.
Only salt remains.
Stranded with a crooked sore.
Hiding pain.
Into a pair of car.
Crash into merchant shores.
What you ask me for.
Then he tries docks at ten.
Dropped with his failing chore.
