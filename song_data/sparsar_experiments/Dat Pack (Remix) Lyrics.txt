Dat Pack (Remix) Lyrics
by Yung Joey.


Uh, know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.

It's the weed man, we ahead on the full up.
Roll up, with the gun, I just pull up.
Some talkin' major cardio, blunt forced trauma.
Light it up, get it hotter, if you see my mama.
Teacher's said I wasn't gon' be shit, in class writin' raps.
Would you look at me now, bitch, shut yo trap.
I'm in the ?, like 2Pac Shakur.
Rhianna breezin' in ? cookin' pip wit yo boy.
Got a prom, DM girl, I go to work.
PhD in culinary arts, kitchen cookin' work.
Smokin' sour diesel on a yacht.
Bitch, how you know my bros? Aye, you a thot.

Uh, know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Uh, know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.

Know I, know I, got dat pack.

Man, they say they gon' stomp me out.
20 blunts can't put me down.
I'm on somethin' they can't even pronounce.
In the goods, I can't even pronounce.
And I'm blackin' out the whole fuckin' house.
Cash count, make them foam at the mouth.
Big budz they imported from Cali.
Countin' up till I can't even balance.
Ballin' in Bali and I ain't pickin' the ballot.
I'm in the valley, I need a couple of ounces.
Mixin' weed, man where ya at? I need that ? poison.
He pull up on forgies, on ganja important.
Psycho me, I'm nervous.
Way too lit, I'm swervin'.
12 pull me over, I know they gon' smell that purple.
12 pull me over, I know they gon' smell that dirty.
12 pull me over, I know they gon' wanna search me.
I got a problem goin' broke, that's why I wake up early.
I gotta get that paper, dawg, I can't put nothin' before.

Uh, know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Uh, know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
Know I, know I, got dat pack.
