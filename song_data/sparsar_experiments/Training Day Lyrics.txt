Alonzo.
You know what they give you for that? The gas chamber! You know what the gas.
chamber smells like......

I'm Xeezy,please believe me,I feel queasy towards the needy.
Marry hoes,I say No,I like ma peace ah mind extra cheesy.
Lames begging they girl Don't leave me!,but was she ever yours?
You know that old saying, What's yours ain't mind,&amp; what's mind ain't.
whores.
&amp; I say pause,because I'm sure's,home boy gon see his way.
Either that,or Mr. get Krabz Pat tricking,got us bobbing when we see him,now.
we smile and wave.
Currently,no T &amp; TEC.
But I get minds just like Aretha Frank.
R.E.S.P.E.C.T and I'm ma let you know who I have to thank.
The woman who used to spank me!
Point period blank me!
I'm ma just be frank...ly.
You made a Million Dollar Baby mama,and I ain't no Hilary Swank-ie.
I love ma family.
Thank you kindly mama,for standing beside me.
You asked me to hop on this beat,&amp; I was like shittttteeee.
I in even know ma mom so trendy.
U.O.E.N.O it.
All that food you eat boy you ain't even growing.
All them waves in yuh head boy you in even Fro-ing.
All these haters,fake friends,wack girls you still make ends meet boy,you.
don't even show it.
&amp; I'm ma keep going.
Making you proud mama everyday I can.
See I don't like Man U,but without you I know I wouldn't be a MAN.
GOD DAMN!

Ma family you know I'm bout it.
See you mess with M,I'm ma highly doubt it.
Yuh see I rep for them,I'm ma say it proudly.
&amp; if you mess with them,there gon sure be problems.

For ma family.
I'm casually gon prolly lead the way.
For them I freaking do this till I see ma dying day.
&amp; ain't no way you messing with em,ain't got nothing left to say.
Since our days no longer sunny,we gon have to make it rain.....
Cause we DO IT.
With or without yuh.
We gon make it,keep on pouting.
When you see us,you'll be doubting.
While our money,we'll keep on counting.
CAUSE WE OUT HERE.......

I was born in the gutter.....
A real undercover brother,who was raised by his mother.
I hope she know I love her.
Ah swear to God,I often wonder why she even bother.
Went so many nights can't believing it's not butter....
Other nights we'd go without bread.
See ma mama blow it on her job.
How the hell we supposed to get ahead.
I rather be dead.
Glad to be born.
Mama not here and ma daddy long gone.
Yeah ma mama got strong.
Yeah ma mama got strenght.
Yeah ma mama got a job.
Yeah ma mama paid the rent.
MAMA NEVER TWO FACED,NO HARVEY DENT.
When Dark nights came fast,wasn't even lent.
For ma mama I gotta respect.
Mama I'm sorry,yeah I gotta repent......
GOD DAMN.

Alonzo.
I'm the man up in this piece. You'll never see the light ah da...who the fuck.
