Monsters Lyrics
by Woodrowgerber.

Monsters.

Golden hair by moonlight.
The forest calls you back tonight.

There's monsters in the woods.
Who's voices sound like rain.
Do not heed their calls.
They only bring you pain.

Monsters in the woods.
Only bring us pain.
Calling to the lost.

Monsters in the woods.
Only bring us pain.
Taking all of us.

They can see you.

You stand at forest edge.
Beauty by moonlight.
I won't lose you again.
To monsters in the night.
