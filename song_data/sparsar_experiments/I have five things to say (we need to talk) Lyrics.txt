I have five things to say (we need to talk) Lyrics
by Rumi.

I Have Five Things To Say.

The wakened lover speaks directly to the beloved.
You are the sky my spirit circles in.
The love inside of love, the resurrection-place.

Let this window be your ear.
I have lost consciousness many times.
With longing for your listening silence.
And your life-quickening smile.

You give attention to the smallest matters.
My suspicious doubts, and to the greatest.

You know my coins are counterfeit.
But you accept them anyway.
My impudence and my pretending!

I have five things to say.
Five fingers to give.
Into your grace.

First, when I was apart from you.

This world did not exist.

Nor any other.

Second, whatever I was looking for.

Was always you.

Third, why did I ever learn to count to three?

Fourth, my cornfield is burning!

Fifth, this finger stands for Rabia.

And this is for someone else.

Is there a difference?

Are these words or tears?
Is weeping speech?
What shall I do, my love?

So he speaks, and everyone around.
Begins to cry with him, laughing crazily.
Moaning in the spreading union.
Of lover and beloved.

This is the true religion. All others.
Are thrown-away bandages beside it.

This is the sema of slavery and mastery.
Dancing together. This is not-being.

Neither words, nor any natural fact.
Can express this.

I know these dancers.
Day and night I sing their songs.
In this phenomenal cage.

My soul, don't try to answer now!
Find a friend, and hide.

But what can stay hidden?
Love's secret is always lifting its head.
Out from under the covers.
Here I am!
