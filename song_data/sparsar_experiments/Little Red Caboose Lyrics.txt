Little Red Caboose Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

Little red caboose chug, chug, chug.
Little red caboose chug, chug, chug.
Little red caboose behind the train.
Smoke stack on its.
Back, back, back, back.
Coming down the.
Track, track, track, track.
Little red caboose behind the train.
Last car on the end, end, end, end.
Racin' round the bend, bend, bend, bend.
Little red caboose behind the train.

It's my favorite car, car, car, car.
Traveling so far, far, far, far.
Little red caboose behind the train.

When you o toot, toot, toot, toot.
You look so cute, cute, cute, cute.
Little red caboose behind the train.

When you go toot, toot, toot, toot.
You look so cute, cute, cute, cute.
Little red caboose behind the train.

Speeding by so fast, fast, fast, fast.
Always the last, last, last, last.
Little red caboose behind the train.

Flying down the line, line, line, line.
Always on time, time, time, time.
Little red caboose behind the train.

Never runnin' late, late, late, late.
Comin' to my state, state, state, state.
Little red caboose behind the train.

All the kids come running down.
To see the greatest train in town.
Come and ride the red caboose.

The second one twice.
