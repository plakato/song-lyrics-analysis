Bring Dat Funk Lyrics
by Big Season Muzik.


Mic check coming back with some funk, shit/I still hearing these bitch niggas
talking shit 
I'm still that deep voice, hardcore cat/I knock these MCs out with a baseball
bat 
I'm swinging mad shit like I'm in the jungle/Strictly to my roots, I'm staying humble 
I'm invading the hip hop planet/Got. These niggas out of control, like Janet 
I'm, still Ruthless and Wrecked/That's right back in full effect. 
A raw cat be getting it in/I want a Brit chick like Alesha, Dixon, 
This ain't, no radio pop smash hit/Or, some ordinary slow-tempo shit, 
Pass the Philly blunt to the B-I-G/While. I'M making beats ripping the M-I-C 
Y'all thought. I was gon na, come back with some wack shit/I coming back with
some funky shit, 
I powerbomb. These cats, like Sycho Sid/You, think I won't watch me, bring the
funk kid 
 
said, REWIND 
I'm, still standing on my own two feet/Like Sisqo, your rhymes are incomplete, 
On, the real I got ta. Let you know/Step to me you in the danger scenario: 
Like Meth Tical. I bring the pain/You still don't understand. Let me explain: 
You ain't, nothing! You ain't! A rapper/Clean up my room ain't, you the
housekeeper, 
Well shit, there's no pressure/I'm! Just cooking up some old school flavor 
I'll put my foot right in the crack of your ass/There's. Like a million MCs I
 got ta harass 
Like Gerald Levert. I got you thinking about it/You didn't know. I came from
the underground pit. 
Y'All thought I was gon na. Come back with some wack shit/I'm coming back with
some funky shit, 
I powerbomb. These cats, like Sycho Sid/Well watch me, bring the funk kid. 
 
OK I'mma make my shit only twelve bars/Niggas out here. Acting like superstars 
Even, though I'm mainstream, I'm still original/I got them. Saying you suck
like Kurt Angle. 
My style is vicious and brutal/I got these old cats. Calling me immortal 
Like O'Jays, I'm giving the people what they want/My dick is really what your
girl want. 
Y'All thought. I came back with some wack shit/But. I came back with some dope
shit 
Y'all said I won't, but I did/Watch me bring the .... You get it
