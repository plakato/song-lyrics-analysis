The Realness Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Real is what you feel.
Feelings aren't real.
Put your money down.
Place your bet and spin the wheel.

Real is what you feel.
Feelings aren't real.
Put your money down.
Place your bet and spin the wheel.

Real is what you feel.
Feelings aren't real.
Put your money down.
Place your bet and spin the wheel.

Real is what you feel.
Feelings aren't real.
Put your money down.
Place your bet and spin the wheel.

The realness.
Th-the realness.

Gonna move into the house.
Gonna move into the house.
Ain't never going home, no.

Gonna move into the house.
Gonna move into the house.
Ain't never going home, no-no.

Feel it!
The realness, th-the realness.
Catch it, touch it.
Touch it, catch it.
Flavor of this fever.

The realness, th-the realness.
Catch it, touch it.
Touch it, catch it.
Flavor of this fever.

The realness.
Th-the realness.
The realness.
Th-the realness.

I know what I feel.
What I feel is real.
What I feel is real.
Cause I know what I feel.
It's real.
It's real.
It's real.
It's real.
It's real.
It's real.
It's real.
It's real.

Put your money down.
Put your money down.
Put your money down.
Place your bet and spin the wheel.

The realness.
The realness.
The realness.
The realness.
Feel it!

The realness.
Th-the realness.
Catch it, touch it.
Touch it, catch it.
Flavor of this fever.

The realness.
Th-the realness.
Catch it, touch it.
Touch it, catch it.
Flavor of this fever.

The realness.
Doesn't really matter if it's real.
Only really matters how we feel.
My love is real.
My love is real.
Is it real?
My love is real.
The realness.
