The Realness Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Real is what you feel: 
Feelings aren't real 
Put your money down, 
Place your bet and spin. The wheel, 
 
Real is what you feel. 
Feelings aren't real 
Put your money down, 
Place your bet and spin. The wheel. 
 
Real is what you feel. 
Feelings aren't real 
Put. Your money down 
Place your bet and spin, the wheel 
 
Real, is what you feel: 
Feelings aren't real 
Put your money down, 
Place your bet and spin. The wheel, 
 
The realness 
Th-the realness 
 
 Gon na move into the house. 
 Gon na move into the house 
Ain't never going home, no 
 
 Gon na move into the house. 
 Gon na move into the house, 
Ain't, never going home, no-no, 
 
Feel it 
The realness, th-the, realness 
Catch; it touch it 
Touch it catch it. 
Flavor of this fever, 
 
The realness, th-the, realness 
Catch. It touch it 
Touch it catch it. 
Flavor of this fever, 
 
The, realness, 
Th-the, realness, 
The, realness, 
Th-the, realness, 
, 
I, know what I feel 
What I feel is real 
What I feel, is real 
Cause. I know what I feel: 
It's real 
It's, real 
It's, real 
It's, real 
It's, real 
It's, real 
It's, real 
It's, real 
 
Put, your money down; 
Put your money down; 
Put your money down; 
Place your bet and spin, the wheel, 
 
The, realness, 
The, realness, 
The, realness, 
The, Realness 
Feel it 
 
The, realness, 
Th-the, realness 
Catch. It touch it 
Touch it catch it. 
Flavor of this fever, 
 
The, realness, 
Th-the, realness 
Catch. It touch it 
Touch it catch it. 
Flavor of this fever, 
 
The, realness, 
Doesn't, really matter. If it's real 
Only really matters. How we feel 
My love is real. 
My love is real 
Is it real 
My love is real 
The realness
