Take On Me Lyrics
by A-ha.


Talking away.
I don't know what I'm to say.
I'll say it anyway.
Today isn't my day to find you.
Shying away.
I'll be coming for your love, ok.

Take on me.
Take me on.
I'll be gone.
In a day or two.

So needless to say.
Of odds and ends.
But I'll be stumbling away.
Slowly learning that life is ok.
Say after me.
It's no better to be safe than sorry.

Take on me.
Take me on.
I'll be gone.
In a day or two.

Oh, things that you say.
Is it a life or just to play my worries away.
You're all the things I've got to remember.
You're shying away.
I'll be coming for you anyway.

Take on me.
Take me on.
I'll be gone.
In a day or two.

Take on me.
Take me on.
I'll be gone.
In a day or two.
