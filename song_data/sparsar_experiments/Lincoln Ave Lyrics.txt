Lincoln Ave Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


We gonna take a trip right now.
Like we always do about that time.

Head nod to my old shit, I really didn't know shit.
Thought I was on some pro shit.
That I always had to talk about poor shit.
I was tryna reach a crowd that ain't have shit.
But the situation kept a nigga stagnant.
All my new shit sounding like my last shit.
How the hell a nigga finna make a smash hit?
Fast forward like 8 months.
When I put the weed down no grape blunt.
I still miss the little way that it stick to you.
And when you quit its like the smell still get to you.
So I- I took a little time, had to find me.
And finally the niggas that's behind me.
I couldn't hang with them niggas on a crime spree.
Lincoln Ave you niggas know where to find me.
Had a talk with my mans bout the whole thing.
Just a matter of time until my phone rings.
Had game but I never had no team.
Had ties but I never had no string.
I been married to the game still no ring.
She been cheatin on a nigga still no flings.
Every fly nigga gotta get his own wings.
But I still don't understand what no means.

My new life better than my old life.
Cause my old life didn't seem so right.
How could I be so young and be so bright.
But my dreams had width still no height.
And things don't change but the vision do.
Im intricate with sentences I give to you.
Im pickier with people that I listen to.
Particularly niggas who ain't winning boo.
Now I make sure everything I make more.
That's really what I had to take a break for.
I didn't have direction but a great core.
I was scratchin' at the surface couldn't break floor.
Its so easy to get sidetracked listening to my tracks.
Niggas talk through it I despise that.
How could I get mad when I do the same thing.
Its my job to keep you in my mood swings.
And I don't give a fuck about anything else but us right now.
I've been workin like a slave.
And I'm feeling like I'm right on the cusp right now.
I'm at a good pace and I really can't afford to be rushed right now.
We see these other niggas getting signed but we gotta do us right now.
