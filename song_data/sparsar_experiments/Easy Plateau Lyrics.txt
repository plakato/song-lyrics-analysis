Easy Plateau Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Let's take a ride to the easy plateau.
Where the cold don't come and the wind don't blow.
Moonlight flickers on the water below.
The orange grove blossoms in the orange grove.
Bad nights lead to better days.
It doesn't matter but I think about it anyway.

I want an easy plateau, some place to rest my head.
I want an easy plateau, some place to rest my head.
For a while, for a while, for a while, for a little while.

Sleepyhead, come on let's take a ride.
To the easy plateau in the back of your mind.
Up through the alley, take the door under the stairs.
My head ain't feeling nothing but cats and rocking chairs.
Bad nights lead to better days.
It never happens but I think about it anyway.

I want an easy plateau, some place to rest my head.
I want an easy plateau, some place to rest my head.
For a while, for a while, for a while, for a little while.

How do I hold on to you.
If I can't hold on to me.
How do I hold on to you.

I want an easy plateau, some place to rest my head.
For a little while.

I want an easy plateau, some place to rest my head.
I want an easy plateau, some place to rest my head.
An easy plateau.
