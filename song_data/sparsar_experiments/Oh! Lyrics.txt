Oh! Lyrics
by Quanche.


And he was going with a woman inside his car, and he stopped, I mean I.
couldn't go anywhere he stopped right in front of me right?
So, I just go like this right? you know? cause I don't have anything else I.
said 'this fucking guy I'm gonna put this shit in his fucking neck if he comes.
and say something to me' you know? I go 'if I get out of this fucking car, one.
of us is gonna go to the fucking hospital!'.

Real Toronto kid nah not the Greater Area.
Rep my shit like where you going? hold up nah, where you from?
Can't be walking 'round here like that buddy you should hurry up.
None of who you see me with is playin' and I ain't Bardot.
Maximo respect to my avenue.
You ain't been this far you tricked the meter like them cabbies do.
Oh is that the case? Oh is that the case?
You running out of smiles you should try and save some face.
You looking out of place, I put you in your place.
You spending all those smiles you should try and save some face.
Free my generation, sweet victory is tasteless.
We get apples from the serpent himself, he saw our faces.
Sketch the future out like Leonardo, you might be waitin'.
The Face of Judas looks like he's impatient what the fucks he saying?
Why are you so existential? all up in your residential with a car it might be.
a rental.
I don't know 'bout you but I know I am just a product.
Yes I'm with your ho but I still want the enchilada.
Oh is that the case?
