Magic Pen Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.


The whole world is looking at me now.
I'm getting so high.
Yes he's getting higher.

Dreadhead Schoolboy &amp; Young D.
Talk about a day when you can't pay.
Talk about a day when you can't say.
What comes to mind because it drifts away.
Got a book full of rhymes but still I say.
I'm getting so high.
On life alright you know.
Yes he's getting higher.
Alright on life you know.
Waiting for my fifteen minutes.
But if I die today John Lennon.
Because I'm living trying to make while they living for the weekend.
Playing wicked games with ya life till it weakens.
Writing in my journal all day while they defend.
Won't stop till the page on top say the end.
Words will attack in a pack got a legion.
Make enough change that we might change seasons.
The life we live to short just to got and waste away.
The life we live can hurt but soon the pain will Fade away.
If I die today no wicked games.
Because we trying to make this season change.
So the Clocks we change.
Till the fifteen minutes come and Ruthless we see the fame.
Assume we stay around.
Sun up to sun down.
Listen to this sound.
From sun up to sun down.
I'm Getting so high.
On life alright you know.
Yes he's getting higher.
Alright on life you know.

Hey could you hand me that pen over there?
This pen right here?
No that pen over there.
You mean the Magic Pen?
Yeah the Magic Pen!
