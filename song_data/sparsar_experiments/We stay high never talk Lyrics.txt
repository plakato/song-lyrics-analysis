We stay high never talk Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

We stay high never talk who knows where we stay at watch out where your hands.
are cooking who knows where danger stays at im blind when u see me black and.
yellow black and yellow diamonds shining everywhere we go i got so many.
females its not even funny trees are green as leafs leafs get rolled everyday.
mamis all over me we drive our cars slow speeds can't be touched where we go u.
can't see us bitch dont kill my time time is always here runs like water wake.
me up when its over wake me up hun people dye young so think fast.
