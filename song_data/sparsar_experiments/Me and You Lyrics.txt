Me and You Lyrics
by Tyler James Williams.


You're spinning round and round and round in my head.
Did you really mean the words that you said?
This is it I gotta know.
Should I stay or should I go?
Show me the truth.
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?

I know you gon' be mad.
The feelings that you thought you had.
Was for another guy.
Well I'm that other guy.
I'm just a shy kid, camouflaged before your eyes.
Then I knew my lyrics were the key to see the other side.
I should have told you but I never had the courage.
And I thought you really wouldn't understand.
And now I'm out here just to let my feelings surface.
Apologizing for disguising who I am.

Coco Jones.
Tell me are you who I thought you were.
Or who I wanted you to be?
Did you do it all for him.
Or were you only playing me?

Tyler James Williams.
I did it for you.
But I couldn't see it through.

You're spinning round and round and round in my head.
Did you really mean the words that you?
This is it I gotta know.
Should I stay or should I go?
Show me the truth.
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?

Tyler James Williams.
You're all I ever wanted.
But I got caught in the shadow in the background.
But I'm back now.
And Kris was all this and that.
And my look didn't really fit the rap, it didn't match.
He had the style and I had the swag.
So I locked up my feelings in the words he said.
Give me a hand and I'll take off my mask.
If you give me a chance, that's all I ask.

Coco Jones.
What you expecting me to do?
First you were him and now you're you.

Tyler James Williams.
Now it's just me.
And you got me on my knees.

You're spinning round and round and round in my head.
Did you really mean the words that you said?
This is it I gotta know.
Should I stay or should I go?
Show me the truth.
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?

Why do I feel so deceived?
Guess I believed what I wanted to believe.
It's perfect in my dreams.
But nothing's really what it seems.

You're spinning round and round and round in my head.
Did you really mean the words that you said?
This is it I gotta know.
Should I stay or should I go?
Show me the truth Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Gonna be me and you?
