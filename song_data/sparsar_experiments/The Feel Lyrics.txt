The Feel Lyrics
by Quiet Luke.


My memories are so vivid.
I just want to dive in and soak in 'em.
I want to go back desperately.
Now reminiscing really turned into my opium.
I switched it up.
Shot up on nostalgia.
And I quit them drugs.
Cause when I'm getting up I'm getting up.
But the next morning I'm getting up in a funk.
I've been bad for eighteen years.
Karma got me fucked, fuck.
I'm tired of the pain.
These fucked up thoughts got me thinking I'm insane.
You don't know my story homie.
Stay inside your lane.
Cause what's happening is something only destiny explains.

This the year that my life changed.
No I don't have cancer.
But damn my life changed.
Now I'm right here looking into my brain.
Trying to figure out if it's the illness of if I changed.
And I'm becoming such a loner, man I feel so isolated.
Don't see eye to eye with anyone I've ever known.
I really felt like I could take some happiness and microwave it.
Now instead I'll plant a seed and wait until it's grown.
Yeah, I'm fine being depressed and fine being obsessed with music.
It gets me through this.
Keep your friends close but don't be foolish.
Your left man's Brutus, your right man's Judas.
I'm really done with the bullshit.
I don't wanna be a cool kid.
My makeshift studio's the bullpen.
When I'm pitching perfect games, I'll be living good, bitch!

You want that sheltered life.
Smoking weed at Pepperdine.
I want to hit the city, dirty subways bumping Nevermind.
Like all the girls before you I knew you were never mine.
Jacks want their Rose and I'm still searching for my Clementine.
Yeah, but either way they still Kate right?
I should just worry 'bout myself and get my cake right? Right.
I miss the crazy hazy late nights.
But the more I dwell on them that seems like a fake life.
I said it seems like a fake life. ..
But I still want that back.

I ain't feelin' good x 2.
I ain't feelin'.
I ain't feelin' good.
WHOA-OH.

I ain't feelin' good x 2.
I ain't feelin' x 3.
I ain't feelin' good x 3.
No, no.
