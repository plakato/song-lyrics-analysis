Doubts Lyrics
by Pup.


I'Ll never get you outta. My mind
It keeps me awake and it keeps me alive
Now that you finally figured me out
I can go home and rest easier, now

So, what's left to lose 

Now that I've got nothing you're having your doubt
Pack all of your bags and move them all. Out
Now that I've got nothing you're having doubts
What am I supposed to do now. 

I haven't felt quite like myself
For months on end
I spend more nights on the floor
Than. In my own bed
And I never see my family or my friends anymore
And I'll write, more apologies than metaphors

So. What'S left to lose, 
What am I. What am I supposed to do now? 
What'S left to lose 

Now that I've got nothing you're having your doubts
Pack all of your bags and move them all out
Now that I've got nothing you're having doubts
What am I supposed to do now? 

What'S left to lose 
What am I supposed to do without you, 
What's left to lose 
What. Am I supposed to do without you 

Now that I've got nothing you're having your doubts
Pack all of your bags and move them all out
Now that I've got nothing you're having doubts
What? Am I supposed to do now,
