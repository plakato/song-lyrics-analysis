Give Me a Try Lyrics
by The Wombats.


I know that I like to let excess exceed.
But I just need you in that fur coat with only my necklace on underneath.

And I don't care why this apartment's always cold.
London can try, it'll never swallow me whole.
And I swear.

We could be gigantic.
Everything I need.
Vicodin on Sunday nights.
This could be worth the risk.
Worth a guarantee.
This could be the drug that doesn't bite.
Just give me a try, just give me a try.
Been kinda hoping you might.
G-g-give me a try.

I know sometimes I lose the plot and I cause a scene.
What do you dream of on the west coast?
When my head is aching in GMT.
And I don't care why this apartment's so ice cold.
Let London try, it'll never swallow me whole.
And I swear.

We could be gigantic.
Everything I need.
Vicodin on Sunday nights.
This could be worth the risk.
Worth a guarantee.
This could be the drug that doesn't bite.
Just give me a try, just give me a try.
Been kinda hoping you might.
G-g-give me a try.

Breakdown.
I'm shaving with your toothpaste.
And trying to vacuum from the ceiling.
The millisecond that you're away.
I get the loneliest feeling.
Just give me a try.
And I swear.
I swear.

We could be gigantic.
Everything I need.
Vicodin on Sunday nights.
This could be worth the risk.
Worth a guarantee.
This could be the drug that never bites.
Just give me a try, just give me a try.
Been kinda hoping you might.
G-g-give me a try.

Give me a try!
Just give me a try.
Just give me a try.
