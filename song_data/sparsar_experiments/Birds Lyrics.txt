Birds Lyrics
by Swift.

I cast away everything I own for this feeling inside of me.
Live my life for my home I'll be safe rather than be left alone.
Feels like I can't live like I used to so I keep bringing new things.
In this to improve the stature of my stance.
At first glance it seems so hard to figure.
Protect my home I hate to but I'm forced to kill.
Two birds with one stone.
So fly away.
Just fly away.
Fo find your place.
While I stay.
I can't stand these claws.
Reaching for my things.
I'll clip your wings.
You sing the same song all the other birds sing.
Pictures and memories take place.
And in due time they wither away.
And all that's left are the feeling that we had.

Stay away while you are here.
My life's not mine.
When you look down from above.
Wishing you could fly with me.
I'm bound by the same things.
I'm not free.
I'm just sticking to the path that belongs to me.
It belongs to me.
