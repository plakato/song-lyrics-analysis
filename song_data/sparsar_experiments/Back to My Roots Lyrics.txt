Back to My Roots Lyrics
by RuPaul.


This a special shout going out.
To my mama, Ms. Ernestine Charles.
Mama used to do people hair in the kitchen.
Press and curl, hot curlers, everythang.
I love you, mama.

Black Hair is a Revolution.
**Cornrows**.
_Uh, uh Honey, I am tender-headed_.
**Jheri Curls**.
_Style Sophistication_.
**Afro Puff**.
Ah, ooh, ah, ooh.
**Hair Weave**.
_Call her Miss Ross_.
**Braids**.
_Pride, Respect_.
**Extensions**.
_More of a 90's Fashion_.
**Asymmetrical Shroom**.
_Banji Girl!_.

I'm going back, back, black to my roots.
Where my love can be found and my heart rings true.
I'm going back, back, black to my roots.
To the time and the place, coming back to you.

Black hair is a Revolution.
**Finger Wave**.
_A Classic Extravaganza!_.
**Press and Curl**.
_Never mix, never worry_.
**Flat Top Fade**.
_Very Contemporary_.
**Nail Sculpture**.
_Urban Distinction_.
**Hot Comb**.
_Ouch Mama! That was my ear!_.
**Blow Out Kits**.
_Ooh, ooh tamba_.
**No-Lye Relaxer**.
_Fried, dyed, and laid to the side_.

Black Hair is....
Now mama got her own salon down on Auburn Ave.
And if you wanna know what's happening in Atlanta.
Just go to the salon, that's to you, all y'all down there.
Brothers and sisters, Miss Earlene, Lizzy Dean, Renetta, Little baby boy, Tone.
Tone, Leonard, K-Ron, Cornisha.
Peace to all my brothers and sisters.
Peace, love and hair grease.

Black Hair Is....
