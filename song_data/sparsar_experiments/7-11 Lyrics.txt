7-11 Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Space man 
High, as outer space man, 
Fucking ridiculous, 
My favorite, album Space Jam 
Exit seat. While I'm riding on your plane, man 
And, I don't go HAM. I go: corn beef, 
Singing, slow jams in between gold teeth; 
At a karaoke stand with your girl getting drunk chief 
She singing Journey 
Getting hella horny 
So. She grabbed my face like Sigourney 
 
At, the 7-Eleven 
Parked in the ally. Out back, we found heaven 
At the 7-Eleven 
Tracing lines on your skin. We found heaven 
 
She said she heard of me from that. Album _Want_ 
She used to bump it in the Target parking lot: 
In her'97 Dodge 
Well, that's hot 
If, her friends get together. Maybe I could watch 
I got the conch ain't. No Lord of the Flies shit 
It's more like you, be catching flies on your eyelids 
But. I keep crashing in the rocks of the sirens 
Playing murder-fuck-kill with death on a desert, island 
 
At, the 7-Eleven 
Parked in the ally. Out back, we found heaven 
At the 7-Eleven 
Tracing lines on your skin. We found heaven 
 
 and we would castaway. 
We were moved yeah, we were lost inside a foreign place, 
 
Then. We wake up and we'd be here and it'd be light again. 
 
Tequila soda 
Talkin', like I'm Yoda 
Trying, to convince a girl that my bed ain't a sofa 
Just come over 
Maybe. I could show ya: 
We could pull the mats out. You could teach me yoga 
Hold up. I can't appreciate and deviate from any sort of discourse that could
maybe aggravate you 
Would. You join me on a date through time. 
I'Ll. Take you to the future 
Where. I blew your mind: 
 
At, the 7-Eleven 
Parked in the ally. Out back, we found heaven 
At the 7-Eleven 
Tracing lines on your skin. We found heaven
