Man Posed Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: IHooray! It's a Deathtrip.
Man Posed.
Follow me around the world.
Come fly with me to meet the maker.
Follow me around the world.
Come fly with me to meet the maker.
In the shadow of the sun.
Life on earth has just begun.
Into nothing, into void we are going.
Follow me around the world.
Come fly with me to meet the maker.
Follow me around the world.
Come fly with me to meet the maker.
In the sky I see us burn.
We are never to return.
Into nothing, into void we are going.

Nail me to the cross to set you free.
&gt;From eating with a silver spoon To living hell and paper moons, in a day.
I remain alive cause I believe.
I may be blind but what I see is me.
No matter how you beg or plea.
I'm tempting what's a man in need, man posed.
