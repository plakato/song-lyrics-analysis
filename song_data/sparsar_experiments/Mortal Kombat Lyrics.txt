Mortal Kombat Lyrics
by X-Raided.


We got a price on ya: head 
Baller, Niggas wan na see ya dead, 
It's a fifty g contract. 
I, don't know what you did: 
But they wan na kill you ya, wife, 
And, ya, kids, on contact. 
 
We got a price on ya: head 
Baller, Niggas wan na see ya dead, 
It's a fifty g contract. 
I, don't know what you did 
But they wan na kill you ya: wife, 
And, ya, kids, Mortal Kombat, 
, 
Close, ya, eyes and envision what the scene was 
Hit a nigga with an AR-15 slug 
And. Then I grab the loot. 
Absolute 
We had to shoot 
Cause. He was lookin at a nigga with a mean mug 
And. The theme was we was in kahoots. 
He played games, shot his ass dead in the brain 
Had, the liquor red, fluid 
Was, a bitch, and I knew it 
When. It came down to it. He was scared to bang 
That nigga dared the game. 
To get his ass with his actions 
Been through it many times before, 
He was down to side 
But how many of them niggas, 
Really gon na, be down to ride when it's time to roll 
Ain't got no time for distractions, 
Money over bitches, 
Cause them ho's ain't. Nuthion but some agravators 
Unnessary temptations, 
Instagatin' situations, 
By makein, hoes swell up like activator 
My nigga, jumped out the lincoln Navigator 
Packin more heat. It'S the Cash And Tango 
Dot-Dog hit the corner with the infared 
On you in the blue 99 dodge durango 
You. Don'T wan na test this 
Fuck around and get stranggled 
Till. They leave you breathless. Busted 
Ya must have a death. Wish 
Ya got heart, 
But, don't get it cardiac arrested, 
It's to late for retractin ya'll statements, 
Ya'll mutha fuckas done wore out my patients 
On my momma, I'm a make sure ya. Hood gets rolled on 
More than some triple-gold-daytons 
Nigga. You don't know what you facein 
Up and tied in the ups 
Take a dance on the x-side 
With mad men and they medalions 
Even all funny style niggas with a trail 
Get they neck tied, 
 
We got a price on ya, head 
Baller, Niggas wan na see Ya dead, 
It's, a fifty g contract 
I, don't know what you did: 
But they wan na kill you ya, wife, 
And, ya, kids, On contact. 
 
We got a price on ya: head 
Baller, Niggas wan na see ya dead, 
It's a fifty g contract. 
I, don't know what you did: 
But they wan na kill you ya: wife, 
And, ya, kids, Mortal kombat, 
 
Take, you outta the game; 
Cause you, a rookie, makin, mastakes, 
You'll fumble, the ball 4th quarter down; seven 
Infiltrated ya game 
Workin for the state 
Lookin for dirt. 

Desintergrated ya, brain 
Me and Dot-Dog crumpled them all 
Like a 6 pointer earth quake 
Bent you outta shape 
Stapped a fifty pound weight to his chest. Plate 
Dummped his fake ass in the lake 
Sleepin, with the fishes 
Cause me and my niggas get vicous 
And hittin it with us 
Is impliable to bullets and bitches 
Impossible 
Have ya, momma visitin, the hospital 
Trama center, where ya delayin-ma fittles 
I'm, soon to be layin in Bed: 
Body bruised green purple to red 
Like, a bag of skittles 
And I'mma pack, a little 380 
Creep into the room, 
Infa beam circle on ya, head 
Boy, now, ya, dead, 
Time to creamate, em 
Seen photo 
I'mma blow up ya stomach for nine months, 
Rosemary baby stab, But up out ya guts 
Hear, his mom screamin 
Mia fyral gave birth to my demon. 
I was ment to be a fyrl screamin 
Callin, all mad men 
If we deeper than the pack 10 
Packin mack 10's 
X-raided for life, 
And nigga ya. Life is in danger, 
Based on a true story: 
Niggas wan na hang, your wife 
Feds find a corpse in a two story: building 
No head no hands; 
Ain't; no checkin dental records; 
Or the the finger prints 
As for Identifyin the body. There ain't no chance 
Got the cops shot, 
Leavin niggas propped up 
In fucked up positions, 
Like dean, koonts hide away, 
I'm a psyco and my motto is 
All of ya: bitch niggas got ta die today, 
I'm takin off whereever. I go 
If you in the car with me: 
Then you'd betta have a gat and a mask 
Ain't no tellin when we have to blast 
Homicide at the crime scene, pickin up the aftermath, 
I'mma forever gon na be after cash 
Thats. Why? I'M at that? Ass 
You! Wanted dead or alive 
First man with ya head get the prize 
If. We kick down the door and catch you in the bed. 
Don'T be surprised. 
We got ta price on the head. 
Baller niggas, wan na see ya dead, 
It's a contract worth fifty g's 
Every killa. In the town lookin for ya, 
With murder on his mind, 
A nine milla and a fifty to squeezee 
Niggas wan na gun ya down 
I, don't know what ya done, but it was major 
You been indited. 
My nigga hit me on the pager 
Every single body. In the town know about it,
