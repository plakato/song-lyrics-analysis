Mortal Kombat Lyrics
by X-Raided.


We got a price on ya head.
Baller Niggas wanna see ya dead.
It's a fifty g contract.
I don't know what you did.
But they wanna kill you ya wife.
And ya kids on contact.

We got a price on ya head.
Baller Niggas wanna see ya dead.
It's a fifty g contract.
I don't know what you did.
But they wanna kill you ya wife.
And ya kids Mortal Kombat.

Close ya eyes and envision what the scene was.
Hit a nigga with an AR-15 slug.
And then I grab the loot.
Absolute.
We had to shoot.
Cause he was lookin at a nigga with a mean mug.
And the theme was we was in kahoots.
He played games shot his ass dead in the brain.
Had the liquor red fluid.
Was a bitch and I knew it.
When it came down to it he was scared to bang.
That nigga dared the game.
To get his ass with his actions.
Been through it many times before.
He was down to side.
But how many of them niggas.
Really gonna be down to ride when it's time to roll.
Ain't got no time for distractions.
Money over bitches.
Cause them ho's ain't nuthion but some agravators.
Unnessary temptations.
Instagatin' situations.
By makein hoes swell up like activator.
My nigga jumped out the lincoln Navigator.
Packin more heat it's the Cash And Tango.
Dot-Dog hit the corner with the infared.
On you in the blue 99 dodge durango.
You don't wanna test this.
Fuck around and get stranggled.
Till they leave you breathless busted.
Ya must have a death wish.
Ya got heart.
But don't get it cardiac arrested.
It's to late for retractin ya'll statements.
Ya'll mutha fuckas done wore out my patients.
On my momma I'm a make sure ya hood gets rolled on.
More than some triple-gold-daytons.
Nigga you don't know what you facein.
Up and tied in the ups.
Take a dance on the x-side.
With mad men and they medalions.
Even all funny style niggas with a trail.
Get they neck tied.

We got a price on ya head.
Baller Niggas wanna see ya dead.
It's a fifty g contract.
I don't know what you did.
But they wanna kill you ya wife.
And ya kids On contact.

We got a price on ya head.
Baller Niggas wanna see ya dead.
It's a fifty g contract.
I don't know what you did.
But they wanna kill you ya wife.
And ya kids Mortal kombat.

Take you outta the game.
Cause you a rookie makin mastakes.
You'll fumble the ball 4th quarter down seven.
Infiltrated ya game.
Workin for the state.
Lookin for dirt.

Desintergrated ya brain.
Me and Dot-Dog crumpled them all.
Like a 6 pointer earth quake.
Bent you outta shape.
Stapped a fifty pound weight to his chest plate.
Dummped his fake ass in the lake.
Sleepin with the fishes.
Cause me and my niggas get vicous.
And hittin it with us.
Is impliable to bullets and bitches.
Impossible.
Have ya momma visitin the hospital.
Trama center where ya delayin-ma fittles.
I'm soon to be layin in bed.
Body bruised green purple to red.
Like a bag of skittles.
And I'mma pack a little 380.
Creep into the room.
Infa beam circle on ya head.
Boy now ya dead.
Time to creamate em.
Seen photo.
I'mma blow up ya stomach for nine months.
Rosemary baby stab but up out ya guts.
Hear his mom screamin.
Mia fyral gave birth to my demon.
I was ment to be a fyrl screamin.
Callin all mad men.
If we deeper than the pack 10.
Packin mack 10's.
X-raided for life.
And nigga ya life is in danger.
Based on a true story.
Niggas wanna hang your wife.
Feds find a corpse in a two story building.
No head no hands.
Ain't no checkin dental records.
Or the the finger prints.
As for Identifyin the body there ain't no chance.
Got the cops shot.
Leavin niggas propped up.
In fucked up positions.
Like dean koonts hide away.
I'm a psyco and my motto is.
All of ya bitch niggas gotta die today.
I'm takin off whereever I go.
If you in the car with me.
Then you'd betta have a gat and a mask.
Ain't no tellin when we have to blast.
Homicide at the crime scene pickin up the aftermath.
I'mma forever gonna be after cash.
Thats why I'm at that ass.
You wanted dead or alive.
First man with ya head get the prize.
If we kick down the door and catch you in the bed.
Don't be surprised.
We gotta price on the head.
Baller niggas wanna see ya dead.
It's a contract worth fifty g's.
Every killa in the town lookin for ya.
With murder on his mind.
A nine milla and a fifty to squeezee.
Niggas wanna gun ya down.
I don't know what ya done but it was major.
You been indited.
My nigga hit me on the pager.
Every single body in the town know about it.
