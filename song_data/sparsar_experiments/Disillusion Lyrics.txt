Disillusion Lyrics
by Unearth.

So much disdain.
So much hatred.
Disillusion with this world;.
Betrayal is the focal point of my dissension.
I tried to keep it right.
But with no remorse.
I was left to die in the gutter.
Nothing remains to strive for.
No more.
Consumed by the binds of failure.
No more.
Where the fuck did I go wrong?
Lies; Lies.
Repulsed by all you stand for.
Lies; Lies.
Faith failed me.
Stabbed in the back.
The blood's still warm, the blood's still warm.
These fallacies.
They've claimed the best and shown the worst.
\- They've shown our worst.
They all strive to make their mark.
It's still Impostors Kingdom.
You failed me.
Now I will fail you.
No more.
Consumed by the binds of failure.
No more.
Where the fuck did I go wrong?
Lies; Lies.
Repulsed by all you stand for.
Lies; Lies.
Faith failed me.
You fucking failed me.
