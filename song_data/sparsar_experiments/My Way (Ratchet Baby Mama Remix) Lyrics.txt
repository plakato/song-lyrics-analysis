My Way (Ratchet Baby Mama Remix) Lyrics
by Yung Poppy.

Ay ? Huh ?
Tyrone Can You Come My Wayyyy.

I Got Something I Really Want To Sayyyy.

Can You Find Another Place To Stayyyy.

Cause Boy You Know You.
Broke As Shit.

Ay.

And You Don't Do Nothing For Your Kid.

Ay.

So Pack Your Clothes.
And Don't Forget Your Kids.

Ay.

Uh-Huh.

Oh Yeah.

Okay.
