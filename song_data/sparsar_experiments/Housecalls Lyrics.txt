Hello this is Dr.Dre. I'm not in right now, but if you leave your name.
And number at the sound of the beep. I'll be sure to give you a call as.
Soon as I return.
beep.
Hello, Dre, this is Patricia. My husband's out of town and I was won-.
Dering...Do you make housecalls ?

Ridin in my car alone not doin anything.
Stopped the answering service because I knew my phone would ring.
Heard it ring once so I picked it up and said 'hello'.
It's Dr.Dre, baby, not your average gigolo.

Coz I make housecalls, it's Dr.Dre the maniac.
Housecalls, the human aphrodisiac.
I love those housecalls to the girls that's all alone.
Housecalls, when your husband's not at home.

It's a quarter after two, I said I'd show around three.
Her husband's out of town and she would like some surgery.
Stopped at the stores so I could get a little wine.
But all they had was Thunderbird 1979.
So I left the store, got in my car, drove to her house and then.
Knocked on the door and heard this sexy voice that said 'come in'.
Opened the door to see what I got from this housecall.
Tall, dark and lovely, 5 ft 8 in a camisole.

Now my name is Dre, 6 ft tall with weavy hair.
The one that comes around when your man just doesn't care.
So if ya feelin sexy late at night and you're all alone.
Just think about the doctor, pick up the telephone.

Hello this is Dr.Dre. I'm not in right now, but if you leave your name.
And number at the sound of the beep. I'll be sure to give you a call as.
Soon as I return.
beep.
