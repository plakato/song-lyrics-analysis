D-Game Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

Krazy.
Nigga this motherfuckin 504 shit deep.

The Colonel Master P, Terror, and I am Krazy.
I'm thugged out Feel it.

Wuz up playah ya' slick with that.
Hundred G chain with the bracelet to match.
Well check this out here wodie lay on the ground.
For I show your clown ass how these hot balls sound, they goin'.

Click Click blouh blouh Click Click blouh.
Click Click blouh blouh Click Click blouh.
Click Click blouh blouh Click Click blouh.
Click Click blouh blouh that's my style.

Terror.
Problem with Terror take it straight to gun.
So we can keep it coporate give up your block and run.
Too much paper here to try an' count by ones.
Whole head cross me, our hollow wall is young.
For you haters on the streets tryin to measure my blow.
If you see the new whip know to add nine o's.
Now I'm up to 2 bricks or 72 o's.
If you counting by the whips then it's 8 different flopes.
I'm heavy lover whether diamonds or broads.
Heavy lover whether cocaine or cars.
And what I hop in, its my option.
To shift your mass put chronic in your dash.

Master P.
Now if its on put the dope in the bag baby.
You come short I'm gon' bust yo' ass baby.
The neighborhood dope man fool yeah that's me.
I'm out that 5-0-4 to that C-P-3.
Give me an ounce and I'm gon flip it to a brick nigga.
You got my scratch--you snitch then you a bitch nigga.
Hit the pen you probably gon' be a missed nigga.
So here's some prop for your motherfuckin tiss nigga.

Krazy.
Imagine all the bricks in the projects was made of cocaine.
I'd be richest young nigga in this rap game.
All my money come in arm of trucks.
More cars more houses more hoes to fuck.
You wasn't worried when I was local nigga, I'm world wide.
You niggas can't take it, You petrified.
The let me loose out that I reveal, Thuggin wit P.
It's No Limit until I die, y'all can't fuck wit me.
