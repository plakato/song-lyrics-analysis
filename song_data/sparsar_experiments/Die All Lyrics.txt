Die All Lyrics
by 666.

You're searching the darkness with opened eyes.
It's cold and silence.
Trapped in a narrow hole.
With no escape.
You realise.
You were buried alive.
Fear's tearing your soul apart.
Death will reach you.
You know terrible torment is waiting for you.
The oxygen is lessen.
You're searching the walls of your coffin.
The end rathes up with you screaming, crying, cowardly.
This is what you must feel.
All of you must die.
You're hanging tied up on the top of a faggot.
You're sweating.
The hell of the end is ringing.
Growing smoke surrounds you.
Hot blazes are licking your disparting flesh.
Higher and higher.
Until your whole body is consumed.
This is what you must feel.
All of you must die.
You're laying thonged on the table.
Hear the sound of a blade scratching stone.
Suddenly the cold metal cuts its may on your back.
Leaving pain and destruction behind.
Cut after cut which converge.
A break for a moment....
You are begging for a fast death.
Then you feel your skin is peeling off your flesh.
This feeling is unbreakable.
