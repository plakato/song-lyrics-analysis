Sunset on High Street Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Bet your bottom dollar.
It won't last that long.
Hopeless outside the moat.
Shedding like a flower.
Honey on your breathe.
God knows how far you'll go.
Others tried to love you.
Claiming the free pass.
Cobwebs consume the postal code.
Wading through eternity.
For the next clean dream.
It's 81 degrees.
Now you're crawling back to me.
It's too late, it's too late.
The price we pay.
Skidrow's gonna make you cry.
Skidrow's gonna make you cry tonight.
The homeless ain't lonely.
It's sunset on high street.
Poverty is all we see.
The homeless ain't lonely.
The homeless ain't lonely tonight.
