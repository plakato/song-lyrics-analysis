24 Bars Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


Six O 
Gang gang gang gang gang 
 
I'm in the cut with the mop trying to clean a nigga block, 
Pop out Glock out everybody getting sparked 
These, niggas snitches man, my city full of narcs 
Bullets. Flying at these targets, you would think I'm throwing darts 
Slamming rakes popping
gates fuck, the Jakes 
If you disrespect L'A I'll, put this .40 to your face and just spaz
out 
Bossman, my shooter on the block with them 9's out 
And, I'm going crazy'till. They free my lil bro 9 out 
Extended clips irons out head shots spill your mind out 
Niggas pulling up. They hide out aim for his back blow his spine
out 
Tell. These fuck niggas turn up 
We sliding with the torch motherfuckers getting burned up. 

Team 600 full of shooters 
MACs TECs German Rugers 
Leave'em stinking like manure 
All, my shorties buckin' shootin' 
, don't shoot'em 
Niggas, knowing how I'm rocking 
I'm a hundred times six so these
Y's, I'm dropping 
Rubber band shit, lil nigga! What'S popping 
Call me Breezy from the bricks? 
I ain't never been a hooper. All I know is shooting bricks 
I'm out here on 600 ten toes in this shit, 
You, don't wan na tweak with us. We got poles in this bitch
