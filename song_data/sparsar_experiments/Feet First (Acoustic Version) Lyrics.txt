Feet First (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Watching the waves.
Crashing beneath me.
Blue and silver.
Chaotic and serene.
And I can't describe.
The view from up here.
Because maybe I.
Won't be able to tell you what I see.
Don't waste.
Your tears on me.
Don't stop now.
Just carry on, carry on, carry on.
You always said.
That things were gonna get better.
But maybe the fog.
Holds answers I can't reach.
And I can't decide.
If I'll ever shake this.
Because maybe I.
Wait, never mind.
Don't tell me how to live.

Don't stop now.
Just carry on, carry on, carry on.
Don't stop now.
Just carry on, carry on, carry on.
And you'll never know.
How bad it feels right now.
Twenty one years now in the making.
Mom and dad, you didn't waste your time.
Because even the greatest architect's.
Masterpiece can be torn to the ground.
But I'm still around.
And you would build a ship.
Or pack my parachute in time.
For the fall.
Yeah, this is love by all means.
And I'll continue building with you.
Don't stop, now.
Just carry on, carry on, carry on.
Don't stop, now.
Just carry on, carry on, carry on.
And you'll never know.
How bad it feels right now.
But at least you know.
That it won't end, yeah, yeah.
But at least you know.
That it won't end.
