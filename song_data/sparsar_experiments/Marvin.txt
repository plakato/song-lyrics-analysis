Marvin
by Visual.

See I grew up on Marvin,Michael &amp; Stevie.
Lennon &amp; then Marley so you can not decieve me.
Your music's demeaning, my music has meaning.
My music has feeling, I give everything I'm seeing.
And I see it all, I untangle every angle.
I study the demons &amp; I learn from the angels.
The devil is hateful &amp; god is grateful.
The righteous embrace you &amp; the weak will hate you.
Im not religion but I know my vision.
Listen, your blind decisions could put you in prison.
Physical or mental, either is cataclysmic.

So, come on people cross to this side.
Let's keep building till we get so high.
I see the changes, the pain &amp; the anguish.
That's why I study communication &amp; language.
These are the tools that will helps us all move.
A network of info is bigger than any school.
Each one teach one is the righteous rule.
But these suckas out here just trying to be coo.
I stay fly ya'll &amp; get lifted.
Don't get me wrong some trendy fools are gifted.
The difference is they want to sell you that image.
The trends,the gimmicks &amp; weak lyrics.
I wanna sell you my soul &amp; no limits.
They heal the body, I heal the spirit.
I'm not a genius, I'm just me, period.
Knowledge is power &amp; suckas are fearing it.
I hope your hearing this, I hope your seeing this.
I paint pictures, I get scenic with it.
The world is changing &amp; the people are brainless.
Intelligence is stupid &amp; being famous is greatness ?
Laws are fucking with us, the banks are fucking us.
The food is killing us, religion molds us.
The world is so cold, everyone is froze up.
No love, no peace just war &amp; more bucks.
Money, money, money.
Kill,kill,kill.
They wanna take our souls &amp; gives us.
Bills,bills,bills.
This is America, this is hysteria.
My friend bought a gun in case they run up in his area.
Argghhhh.
