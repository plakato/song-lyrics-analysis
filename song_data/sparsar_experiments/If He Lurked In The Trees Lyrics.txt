If He Lurked In The Trees Lyrics
by Tyler Major.


I'm out of it.
Clouded at the break of dawn.
Panther claws slashin through my mind rate of mastadons stompin through some.
vines during not in their own time.
I'm not on my own time its borrowed.
I owe him my tomorrow.
Tomorrows are filled with sorrow.
Do you even really need it.
The hungry bitch I feed it.
Been like that since early stage of fetus.
Feed us your murder threats rape dreams.
Realitys a lie thats why hate things.
Real. id rather live a fake life fake wife mass slaughter daily with a fake.
knife.
Cakes right here.
No money issues.
I finally dont constantly ejaculate in tissues.
Logic thoughts I miss you.
Replaced you with bike helmets and pistols.
Pig latin an stencils.
Snort habits tenchu.
Hit these hoes with the okie doke doki doki.
Im going bowling with my innerself striking only.
Whos that fag that I never really see.
Lynard, the last panther posted in the trees.
Enter, the last jungle that youll ever see.
Youll only see me with the box cutter things.
In my pockets.
Happiness this not it.
Laughing in the cockpit.
As I crash an burn peoples lives? im not concerned.
With them at all.
Let souls withdraw with a slotzenburg man as the cause.
And im standing tall.

Break.

Whats the matter tracey vocal chords getting lazy like a married man who owns.
a van with no sex lately?
Has three kids ones a bitch the others gay the thirds a genius.
2nd grade he told his teacher fuck this class and youre an idiot.
So put him in the gifted room hes stressin.
Teacher takes roll.
Ironiclly hes never present.
Until on friday _____ is there smiling with a weapon that he sprays hitting.
the sign that says he had a good day.
