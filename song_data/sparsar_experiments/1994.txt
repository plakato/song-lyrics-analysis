Girl next door told me turn the music down.
The decibels turn your ugly ass around.
She said she need to study and she need a quiet place.
I said I need a loud one don't try and violate me.
Shit, I told her go do something.
Put them earplugs and quit all that mean mugging.
You use too many books and you need that common knowledge.
That's why grades ain't the most important shit in college.
I think too big, my rooms too small.
At least my dreams reaching farther than these walls.
I mean the teacher smart, but he got no balls.
And most of the classmates won't ever live the life they want.
That's I day dream, stare off into space.
You wonder what I'm thinking bout? I'm thinking bout the stage.
I'm thinking bout the place and my mother in the beach house.
You ain't gotta listen to what all these nerds preach bout. Right?
One Love.
