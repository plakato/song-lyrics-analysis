Doobies Lyrics
by Yung ELi.

I'm in my damn zone I'm rollin that strong like I'm smokin on arms.
I'm feelin in charge I'm tryna live large I need a massage.
Kuz this life so stressful.
Kant no one help u.
You gota roll up ya sleeves n get like steve get on ya job I tell u.
I'm smokin on doobies I'm smokin on doobies I'm smokin on doobies.
These bitches is choosey these haters amuse me but shit is all groovy.
Kuz ima do my thing.
Yea shit bout to change.
Ya bitch gon want me all on her just like vera wing.
I'm up on cloud nine I'm stoned out my mind like just I looked at medusa.
Until its my time I'm still I'm on my grind just like a damn juicer.
Gms the future.
And that ain't no rumor.
We smokin loud fck turning dwn I mean.
We ain't computers.

I'm smokin on doobies I'm smokin on doobies I'm smokin on doobies.
I'm smokin on doobies I'm smokin on doobies I'm smokin on doobies.
Rollin good no movie.
Yea u know shit loopy.
When u got raw paper and that fronto to roll that doobie.

Smokin that owee that's up in this doobie make me look like droopy.
Shorty all on me while bumpin my music like she is a groupie.
She talkin so much I give her the d since I don't have chewys.
But her pussy so wet and warm it feel like I'm in a jacuzzi.
Ima need a lighter for this fire kuz I'm tryna get higher than mariah.
Burning gas like I'm burning tires smokin on that stink shit like we.
Rollin fckin diapers.
I'm bout to go beast like a tiger.
Kuz I got this fckin heat for my nigah peter piper.
N I ain't talkin bout no weed but you know its good weed in this ma fckin.
cypher.
I'm rollin up doobies I'm smokin on doobies shoutout to my bro.
You already kno its Nomore blunts just paper and fronto.
