Gettin' Too Heavy Lyrics
by 3LW.

Sitting here chillin' with you.
You're getting close boy.
But I'm playing it cool.
I must confess.
I'm feeling you.
But I'm laying down some rules.
Get one thing straight.
I won't be played.
I don't get down that way.

You asked me once, I told you twice.
When will you understand?
I asked my friends for their advice.
They say girl don't give in.
In you and me, I believe.
But I'm torn between.
It's getting too heavy for me.

Baby why you stress me.
Like that.
Talkin' 'bout what you have done in the past.
I don't take love so casually.
So don't put that pressure on me.
Baby just walk right out the door.
Cause I've heard those lines before.

You asked me once, I told you twice.
When will you understand?
I asked my friends for their advice.
They say girl don't give in.
In you and me, I believe.
But I'm torn between.
It's getting too heavy for me.

You're telling me this would prove that I care.

But if I waited baby, will you be there?
Will you be there?
There-er-er-er-errr.

Breakdown.
You know I like you boy.
But you gotta understand.
That I'm just not ready.
Been real with you.
But we gotta take our time.
And I'm torn between.

I'm torn between.
It's getting too heavy for me.

You asked me once, I told you twice.
When will you understand?
I asked my friends for their advice.
They say girl don't give in.
In you and me, I believe.
But I'm torn between.
It's getting too heavy for me.

For me.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Oh oh, oh oh.

In you and me, I believe.
But I'm torn between.
It's getting too heavy for me.

It's getting too heavy.
Heavy, heavy, yeah.
Don't make me say it again.
