Temple Of Hate Lyrics
by Xandria.

Every day I am facing a new way of chasing.
The dreams I am losing in constant defense.
The world keeps on turning, the beds are still burning.
In foolish unconsciousness and self pretense.

Take it away, take it away, free me.
Take it from me, take it from me now!
Falling astray, falling astray faster.
Only to see how…

Deep in the shadows it´s hiding for me.
Down there the demon is rising.
Coming to carry my soul down with him.
Down into the temple of hate.

All the ways that are leading into hell´s open ceiling.
Are carrying names so familiar to me.
It´s so hard to stay who I am when your knifes.
Rip my heart out and hit me again and again.

Oh, please help me – Oh, let me be.

Take it away, take it away, free me.
Take it from me, take it from me now!
Falling astray, falling astray faster.
But I will keep it under the surface of my smiling face.
No-one can see what´s behind this mask for the world.
I am wearing all time so I can survive.
Because…

Deep in the shadows it´s hiding for me.
Down there the demon is rising.
Coming to carry my soul down with him.
Down into the blackness of the temple of hate.
