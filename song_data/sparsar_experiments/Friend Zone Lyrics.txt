Friend Zone Lyrics
by Uniq Mic.


Dis fih dih gyal dem.
Dis fih dih gyal dem.
We nah want your friend zone.
We nah want your friend zone.

Don't call me father, don't call me brother.
To put me in a friend zone, nope, find another.
Me nah friend zone material.

You're mad if you tink we can just be friends.
I'm serious, this is not pretends.
I won't stop till like Mercedes she bends.
I tell myself and all of my mens.
Don't call me for crap.
Like a flag ama hung up.
I want your loving.
So start solving.
De problem.
Dem other guys.
Me not like dem.
Me want a real ting and not no game.

Don't call me father, don't call me brother.
To put me in a friend zone, nope, find another.
Me nah friend zone material.

Am not ur brother, or ur father.
Or homie, or buddie, or sonnie, girl, don't u bother.
Siving me a title like a song.
If it ain't vital, I won't play along.
I want a girl dat can feed me cookie.

And all adih gyal dem a know dis.
Coz all of de gyal dem ah notice.
Me never inah a friendzone.
Always, me always flex on.

Don't call me father, don't call me brother.
To put me in a friend zone, nope, find another.
Me nah friend zone material.

Me ah never inah friend zone, friend zone, never in ah friend zone.
All ah deh gyal dem me flex on.
Dem know dis, dem know dis, me ah wanna ah gyal flex on, flex on.
Know dis, dem know dis, me ah wanna gyal flex on, flex on.

Don't call me father, don't call me brother.
To put me in a friend zone, nope, find another.
Me nah friend zone material.
