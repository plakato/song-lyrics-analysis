Fantastic Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


Aye bitch 
Its Nasty, Hahaha 
Call me V, 
Or V-Fuckin'-Nasty 
Everywhere, I go, I be fuckin' flashy 
 
I always have a show out. They harass me 
Everybody know my name. Bitch stop askin' 
Tell me where the cash at 
I get up, and I grab that 
My life is fantastic. Did I forget to add that 
 
Got money in the attic and in the Gladpack 
They say? Oh, she old news who ain't had that 
I buy new shoes just for the box. 
Fill it up with bands till its filled to the top 
Time is money. I put a hunnid on a watch. 
My life is fantastic. I turn it up a notch. 
 
My whip, fantastic 
Yeah, my wrist fantastic 
Bitch, I'm rich, that's fantastic, 
Cuff, yo bitch. She fantastic 
 
Yeah, I like yo bitch, and that bitch is fantastic. 
I get money every day. Getting money is a habit. 
Gettin' stacks on deck got stacks in the attic 
Bitch. I'M fantastic, my life's fantastic 
, 
Getting chauffeured in the backseat backseat reclinin' 
5 Star, restaurants, that's what I dine in 
They hear V-Nasty and they know be shinin' 
Gold rims gold tint when I'm slidin' 
Why yo bitch whinin hittin'. My line, 
 
Time is money. She forgettin' the time 
She forgettin' the mine 
She be needin. The most 
Just made a hunnid K 
But. I don't boast 
 
Just chill and have fun 
A couple naked, bitches dancin' for ones 
Purple from East Oakland. It'S burnin', my lungs 
I feel fantastic. When I'm high up off these drugs, 
 
My whip, fantastic 
Yeah, my wrist fantastic 
Bitch, I'm rich, that's fantastic, 
Cuff, yo bitch. She fantastic 
 
Yeah, I like yo bitch, and that bitch is fantastic. 
I get money every day. Getting money is a habit. 
Gettin' stacks on deck got stacks in the attic 
Bitch, I'm fantastic, my life's fantastic 
 
In, the club with six hoes 
Two of them they molly 
They, was off they molly. I was in my Maserati 
On the interstate goin', like 150 
She, say you so different 
You. Should see my city 
 
Ride around with bricks 
Ride around with big banks 
Smell, like you, can't tell me that my shit stank 
Styrofoam in my hand, molly in my mouth 
They said the club done its a party at my house, 
 
My whip, fantastic 
Yeah. My wrist fantastic 
Bitch, I'm rich, that's fantastic, 
Cuff, yo bitch. She fantastic 
 
Yeah, I like yo bitch, and that bitch is fantastic. 
I get money every day. Getting money is a habit. 
Gettin' stacks on deck got stacks in the attic 
Bitch, I'm fantastic. My life's fantastic
