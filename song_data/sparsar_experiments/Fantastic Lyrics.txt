Fantastic Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


Aye, bitch.
Its Nasty! Hahaha.
Call me V.
Or V-Fuckin'-Nasty.
Everywhere I go, I be fuckin' flashy.

I always have a show out, they harass me.
Everybody know my name, bitch stop askin'.
Tell me where the cash at.
I get up and I grab that.
My life is fantastic did I forget to add that?

Got money in the attic and in the Gladpack.
They say oh she old news, who ain't had that?
I buy new shoes just for the box.
Fill it up with bands till its filled to the top.
Time is money, I put a hunnid on a watch.
My life is fantastic I turn it up a notch.

My whip, fantastic.
Yeah, my wrist fantastic.
Bitch I'm rich, that's fantastic.
Cuff yo bitch, she fantastic.

Yeah, I like yo bitch and that bitch is fantastic.
I get money every day getting money is a habit.
Gettin' stacks on deck, got stacks in the attic.
Bitch, I'm fantastic my life's fantastic.

Getting chauffeured in the backseat, backseat reclinin'.
5 Star restaurants that's what I dine in.
They hear V-Nasty and they know be shinin'.
Gold rims gold tint when I'm slidin'.
Why yo bitch whinin, hittin' my line?

Time is money, she forgettin' the time.
She forgettin' the mine.
She be needin the most.
Just made a hunnid K.
But I don't boast.

Just chill and have fun.
A couple naked bitches, dancin' for ones.
Purple from East Oakland, it's burnin' my lungs.
I feel fantastic, when I'm high up off these drugs.

My whip, fantastic.
Yeah, my wrist fantastic.
Bitch I'm rich, that's fantastic.
Cuff yo bitch, she fantastic.

Yeah, I like yo bitch and that bitch is fantastic.
I get money every day getting money is a habit.
Gettin' stacks on deck, got stacks in the attic.
Bitch, I'm fantastic my life's fantastic.

In the club with six hoes.
Two of them they molly.
They was off they molly, I was in my Maserati.
On the interstate, goin' like 150.
She say you so different.
You should see my city.

Ride around with bricks.
Ride around with big banks.
Smell like ? you can't tell me that my shit stank.
Styrofoam in my hand, molly in my mouth.
They said the club done its a party at my house.

My whip, fantastic.
Yeah, my wrist fantastic.
Bitch I'm rich, that's fantastic.
Cuff yo bitch, she fantastic.

Yeah, I like yo bitch and that bitch is fantastic.
I get money every day getting money is a habit.
Gettin' stacks on deck, got stacks in the attic.
Bitch, I'm fantastic my life's fantastic.
