Grind Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


This how we do it, where I'm from.
Chasin' that paper, tryna race the sun.
Griiind, all day, cuz I gotta get pai-ai-aid.

Lil' Flip - talking.
Mh, yo, uh, gyeah ye, uh uh.

Now where I'm from we be grindin'.
But I thank god, that I made it rhymin'.
Ye, you wanna track you gotta pay me dawg.
Until then I'mma be at the playas ball.
Chuuch, I got that work, I got the pilsbury dough boy.
I'm in the hood, with my boys like I'm Doughboy.
I rock air force oncs wit my logo.
Straps and ties cuz I'm ready to ride.
Jump, I dump heat, as quich as I dump beats.
And I'll be damned if I let a broke rappa pump me.
I'm from the clover man, I tried to told ya man.
I blow doulja man, but I'm focused man.

This how we do it, where I'm from.
Chasin' that paper, tryna race the sun.
Griiind, all day, cuz I gotta get pai-ai-aid.

Ayy look I got it on my mind, I'mma go wit my hustle.
And if my word ain't shit, I'mma show with my muscle.
Ridin' wit a stash, I got mo in the muffler.
Ask about me, they say ro is a hustler.
Like, extra extra, read all about it.
I got x n x n, weed I'm about it.
Cash that is, say man thats the reason.
When the spring fall, summer all grindin' season.
But I ain't wit that phone, you can hit me on my beeper.
Got affordable price, come and holla at ya people.
You coppin' tryna play, gotta taxin on the game.
Niggas like ro you trippin, but niggas done did the same.

This how we do it, where I'm from.
Chasin' that paper, tryna race the sun.
Griiind, all day, cuz I gotta get pai-ai-aid.

Koopa, I got plado, cutting my money like silly puddy.
A girl with good credit, with a crib in Philly for me.
Dorm room dykes, that don't like to really study.
That love me enough to show ya the choppers my ish is ugly.
Chamillionaire, modden day shakespeare.
Shake fake pears, make 'em sound like they behind eight years.
Hey it's, time to show you how to get a gram.
Rims tickin' in the clock, wise motion like a minute hand.
Tell me who realer than me, I am king.
Act like crayola wit my crayolas and supply my green.
My coach told me chamillion, theirs no I in team.
Well try this ring, and tell me if theres an I in bling.

This how we do it, where I'm from.
Chasin' that paper, tryna race the sun.
Griiind, all day, cuz I gotta get pai-ai-aid.

Ay ay.
The roosters crowin', no time for snorin'.
Money grow on trees, time to rake the lawn.
Life a movie, I'mma the star in the tape is gone.
I do my chores, clean the glass make sure the paint is glowin.
Grab a chicken off the farm, whip it n take it's grown.
Grab a dollar wit the dimes, hoes this day done gone.
I clap behind niggas that hate I'm flowin'.
Give a damn if I hit 'em n penetrate his grown.
You think my man flip hold hand cuffs for fun.
These hoes bring 'em back huns that don't strip for ones.
We drink armadale vodka, we kissin' pladaon.
Take trips to porto rico, to take dips in ponds.

Firt nigga ignoring.
Till he seen the 22's moon walkin' on the floor n.
My life I'm enjoyin', if it ain't about no money then the conversation boring.
I'd like to sound sorry, for loosin n wreckin the clubs that we tore in.
Hold up mayne, Hold up mayne, it's an old time thang.

Chicken heads poppin' brauds to see where the rocs sit.
But they ain't gotta look long, they on top of the wrists.
Plus I'm in the drop six in the missing top fixed.
Ya boi shop in hell, cuz all I buy is hot shit.
In other words I been to hell and back.
Rappin' and sellin' crack, and sprewells on the lac.
Yuh boi, teach that ho how to act.
Cuz we run trains of hoes, jus like rail road tracks.
Now go grab a gat, but I hope you don't come.
To my hood set trippin' like you got a gun.
But if you do dawg, I hope you ain't the only one.
Cuz you get beat up so bad, you'll forget where you from.
Nigga, what?, nah I'm sayin, nah I'm sayin.
The hell wit ya'll niggas, nah I'm sayin.

Yung Ro Talking.
This how we do where we from fa real.

This how we do it, where I'm from.
Chasin' that paper, tryna race the sun.
Griiind, all day, cuz I gotta get pai-ai-aid.
