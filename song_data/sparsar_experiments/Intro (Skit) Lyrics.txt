Intro (Skit) Lyrics
by Tyler Tracey.

You know what's crazy? It seems like just yesterday I was thinking about.
making a SoundCloud.
And I would put out a freestyle, put out a mixtape.
I was working on my first music video, I was starting a label.
Now look at me now.
I'm on my fifth mixtape and I'm planning an EP and planning an album.
I'm running a whole record label and I'm off in college doing things.
Man, there were people back then who never thought I'd even graduate.
There were people who thought I'd be, you know, like, in a hospital or be in.
prison by now.
Or I'd be dead or something, you know? Soâ€¦
I mean, to me this is just amazing.
And you know what the best part is? I'm making the music that I love.
And even if no one else loves it I love it and no one can take that away from.
me.
This is the kind of music I know I'm going to enjoy 10 years down the road,.
Look back and know I love it and know I'm proud of it.
It's just crazy to me.
And you know, I hate to be that cliche the rapper give shoutouts in his.

I have to give some shoutouts.
I have to give a shoutout to my parents, my Mom and my Dad, I love you both.
And as much hard times as I gave you guys, I'm really sorry, but I hope you.
can be proud of me now.
A shoutout to my brothers and my sisters: Jarrett, Dakota, Ranjeni, Rageni,.
Devon, Dawson.
You guys mean the world to me.
Shoutout to Reece Steele man, she's my Twitter buddy, she's been holding me.
down.
Shoutout to Jerry too man, you're like my second Dad.
And I promise one day I'll get you that Harley.
I know you already got a good one but I promise I'll get you a really good one.
Rest In Peace Betty, we all miss you.
Tongue Twister Crew.
This is Tyler Tracey.
I'm Dreaming Out Loud.
Yeah.
