Deuce-5 To Life Lyrics
by X-Raided.

Artist: X-Raided.
Album: Xorcist.
Song: Deuce-5 To Life.

187, gang related, I'm accused.
And after every court date my face is on the news.
They say I wrote a song about a murder.
I maintain my innocence, it's nothing but a coincidence.
I'll admit it looks kind of shadey.
From the outside looking in.
The situation is serious but people don't comprehend.
I was 17 years young back in '92.
Facing 25 to life for something I didn't do.
My song is supposed to be a big admission on my part.
And they're using the lyrics against me when my trial gets ready to start.
My songs are being misinterpritated.
It ain't nothing but the D.A. trying to prove premeditated.
They've got X-Raided stuck, majorly crossed up.
The D.A. got a fucked up witness and my lawyer is a dump truck.
I've been sitting in the county, three years have already went by.
They're pressuring my Locs, trying to get them to testify.
Snitching ain't no joke, it's hazardous to your health.
When you point one finger at me, you're pointing three back at yourself.
My homies got convicted for murder in the first degree.
Ain't no doubt about it, they'll try to do worse to me.
They take me in the court room in front of an all white jury.
With the family looking me with barely concealed fury.
My lawyer standing next to me, prepared to represent.
And help me get convicted cause to him.
I'm guilty till proven innocent....

Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life?
They trying to give me 25 to life cause I'm guilty till proven innocent....

I open up the front page of the Sacramento Bee.
And read the article that Dan McGrath wrote about me.
He has his own opinion and it's his job to write it.
I say he's being biased and completly one sided.
The media write their stories for the public to consume.
And any chance I have of getting a fair trial in Sac is doomed.
Any potential jurors mind is being contaminated.
From reading all the bull they wrote about X-Raided.
I never told anybody to go out kill somebody's folks.
And blaming it all on me and.
A song I wrote is a complete joke.
They're looking for a move but they're looking in the dark.
Putting a noose around my neck and a bullet in my heart.
Just because I'm capable of killing doesn't mean I kill.
And just because I'm capable of killing doesn't mean I will.
I wish they all knew, how can I make you feel me?
X-Raided didn't do it but I've gotta ride cause I'm guilty till proven.
innocent....

Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life?
They trying to give me 25 to life cause I'm guilty till proven innocent....

I'm knowing I'm going to end up in the pen.
Fighting my appeal and hoping that I win.
It's me and Baby Bread fighting this fucked up case.
Like Dooney and B-Dub trying to get these years erased.
In Sac there ain't no love when you're from the Garden Blocc.
Maniac, C-Mooney, Baby Snake and Lil' Venom already got washed.
I'm trying to keep my head up but my load is getting heavy.
It makes me want to do like Sicx: take some Tylenol and get it over with.
But instead I just maintain and do everything to keep my composure.
Representing the Blocc to the fullest and riding like a soldier.
I told you fools the X-Loc ain't going out like the average.
I didn't kill your folks but if you run up then I gotta loc up like a.
savage.
On that ass, bitch, it ain't nothing personal thang, it's just about.
survival.
And I'm going to be 125 years old before I die.
If I can help it.
You made your threats and I felt it but I ain't dead yet.
So you niggas talking about.
What you're going to do when you see me.
I'll be on the weights, wearing state boots and a beanie.
I wish I didn't have to be this way but it's reality.
So I'm strapped based on the fact.
I'm guilty till proven innocent....

Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life?
They trying to give me 25 to life.
Cause I'm guilty till proven innocent....
