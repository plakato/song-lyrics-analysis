Bizness As Usual Lyrics
by Wrekonize.


Bizness goes on as usual.
Except that my brother is dead.
He was 25, and very much alive.
But the dreams have all been blasted from his head.

They place bets and watch the working man run like a race horse.
Back and forth fighting in a minimum wage war.
Riding our high horse, stable unpaid for.
Hoof marks to push start, all terrain war.
I'm asking, can you, see it, now.
Asking for rations of oxygen for breathing.
For now breathe free ya'll, make sure to breathe deep ya'll.
Wake up from your sleep ya'll, they got us all asleep ya'll.
They televise, medi-ize, tellin' lies.
Which be drivin' me to drink too much.
Drivin' me to think too much.
About the aids plaque, rumors of a super strain.
Indonesia death toll, cracks in the Hoover Dam.
All too convenient, protection of the homeland.
Sympathy for terrorism brewin' in the Sudan.
Nothin' but MJ all over the tube man.
I'm tryin' to survive, what's a human gotta do man.
Extra, extra, fear soul on the news stand.
And the bad one is it's funny cuz it's true man.
The last four years have been stupid severe.
And it ain't even the past, it's the future.
It's here, we like three blind mice.
To their, three times twice thrice.
Anti-Christ commission drillin' Vermillions.
G.I.'s bite bullets, welcome to the new millenium.
