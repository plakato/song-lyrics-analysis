Carried away Lyrics
by Akala.

Another hearse roll up slow.
Carry one more poor lost soul.
Carry them things every single day.
Coz it makes him feel safe.
Coz he carry on them ways, screw face.
Love the game, reppin' his estate.
Talk tough look straight in his face.
Carrying deep pain, self-hate.
Carry fam, so he carry weight.
It's logical daddy got carried away.
Not married away, just didn't stay.
This Coward carried his son to this fate.
His boys carrying weight in a wooden box.
Can't stand straight.
They was getting outta the game.
But look fate she don't wait.
Now the woman in the front row, her face.
Show no pain.
But her brain went insane on the day the.
News came.
Stare into space, face numb.
The boy getting carried, she carried 9.
Months.

When this world strip me naked, I turn and.
I face it.
And really believe I have the strength to.
Change it.
I'm crazy, it's blatant sometimes I get.
Carried away.
When this world strip me naked, I turn and.
I face it.
And really believe I have the strength to.
Change it.
I'm crazy, it's blatant sometimes I get.
Carried away.

One more body bag getting carried back.
From the war zone where they carry.
Straps.
Where little kids is attacking tanks coz.
They carry no fear of the man.
All they know here is they land.
And a hero, gotta make a stand.
So they roll cold with it in their hand.
Let it bang on the big bad man.
But this particular soldier never move.
Colder.
Never enrolled to blow no homes up.
Felt that life had carried him under.
Chose to phone the number.
The army gives you training.
Nothing they say could really explain it.
Sign them papers, enslavement.
Now you're a tool to carry their hatred.
Rob, steal, strip a nation.
All he wanted was qualifications.
So he could carry his family places.
Better than those that he was raised in.
Never really thought, he'd ever have to go.
To war.
Now who's gonna tell his kids daddy can't.
Carry them no more.
