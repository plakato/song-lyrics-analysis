Carried away Lyrics
by Akala.

Another hearse roll up, slow, 
Carry, one more poor, lost soul, 
Carry them things every single day, 
Coz it makes him feel safe 
Coz. He carry on them ways screw face 
Love the game reppin' his estate 
Talk, tough, look straight in his face: 
Carrying deep pain, self-hate 
Carry fam, so he carry weight. 
It'S logical, daddy, got carried away, 
Not married away, just didn't stay. 
This Coward carried his son to this fate. 
His boys carrying weight in a wooden box 
Can't stand straight. 
They was getting outta. The game 
But look fate. She don't wait. 
Now, the woman in the front row her face 
Show, no pain, 
But, her brain went insane on the day the 
News came 
Stare into space, face numb, 
The boy getting carried. She carried 9 
Months 
 
When this world strip me naked. I turn and 
I face it. 
And really believe I have the strength to 
Change. It 
I'm crazy, it's blatant. Sometimes I get 
Carried away. 
When this world strip me naked. I turn and 
I face it. 
And really believe I have the strength to 
Change. It 
I'm crazy, it's blatant! Sometimes I get 
Carried away: 
 
One, more body bag, getting carried back 
From the war zone where they carry 
Straps 
Where little kids is attacking tanks. Coz 
They carry no fear of the man 
All they know here. Is they land 
And a hero got ta, make a stand. 
So they roll cold with it in their hand, 
Let it bang on the big bad man 
But. This particular soldier. Never move 
Colder 
Never enrolled to blow no homes up 
Felt that life had carried him under 
Chose to phone. The number 
The army gives you training 
Nothing, they say, could really explain it. 
Sign them papers, enslavement, 
Now, you're, a tool to carry their hatred, 
Rob steal strip. A nation 
All he wanted was qualifications 
So. He could carry his family places 
Better than those that he was raised in 
Never really thought. He'D ever have to go. 
To war, 
Now who's gon na tell his kids daddy, can't 
Carry them no more .
