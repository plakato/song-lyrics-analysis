Herb Shuttles Lyrics
by The Underachievers.


One mic, in the mothafuckin' studio.
Spit gold, when a nigga hit this flow.
You sink, we float, no heathens on my boat.
Sour diesel when I hit good smoke.
Guided by the light, nigga keep your dark.
Third eye sharp like a mothafuckin' hawk.
Heart stay mellow like a fuckin' meadowlark.
Better play smart before you get eatin' by sharks, nigga.

Enter the game, know what's up.
Little bit of fame, little bit of drugs.
Shawty see the chain, same night in her guts.
We don't play, UA.
that's us.
Smoking sensi, high.
sensei in your membrane.
Men slay everyday, for the means of justice, trust it.
Be the reason why I say Fuck this, Fuck This.
Elevate my mind, I'mma push it.

Ok, I'm smoking up on my herb shuttles.
Elevated, nigga that's the motto.
Floating up, a nigga live full throttle.
That pink moscato, she drink the bottle.
Knowledge nigga, crown the kings.
Got the wisdom from the light like Socrates.
You ain't about that life, nigga drop to your knees.
In the presence of mothafuckin' legend my G.

G, I'm a legend my G.
Reefer blowin', sour diesel potent.
Got my 3 eyes open, Pineal gland is swollen.
Astral Planes I'm floatin', Goddammit, I'm free.
I be GOD, please you are not in my league.
Got the spirit of asata honor I be gavel free.
Battle scars in my bars red star I'm elite.
UA, elevate, feel the mark of the beast.

Herb shuttles, I'm gettin' high.
In the solar, nigga fuck the skies.
Beast Coast, we on the rise.
We resurrected from out your mind.
Nigga, from out your mind.
Mothafuckas think they good cause they livin' lies.
Oh, oh you livin' lies?
But we killin' these niggas, we ain't even trying.
Bow down to the pharaoh.
Only got time for that good shit and my cashflow.
UA niggas save souls.
Mix the dream with the mothafuckin' hash so it burn slow.
Kick back counting pesos.
Do my mind a little different so my mothafuckin' brain grow.
Two L's when I take off.
You ain't about that life, get your mind up, times up.
Elevate, you lil' niggas hella fake.
I'm on my shit like toilets.
UA gang banging shit like chip throwing tantrums.
Motherfuckers can't hang with us.
Enlighten like thunder and rain.
Fuck America, New World freedom reign.
Enlighten like thunder and rain.
Fuck America...

This that indigo anthem.
Fly like passports, no randoms.
Searchin' for that purpose, merge with.
A little bit of piece of mind on this earth, bitch.
Earth shift of a kind, esoteric tattoos.
Mad jewels, cash rules, nothing to the blind.
I'm on another plateau, camels get the cash ghost.
How I rose, Derrick in his prime.
Climb to the top of a mountain, top of your dreams, chop-chop.
Then you find a fountain of gleam, fear not.
You don't need a pocket of green.
Just the gold in your heart and your eyes, Supreme King.
Like J's, beat game and receive ring.
Metaphor for the lord, and I'mma deploy.
Trap jaws on the holy Cross.
Lights stream nigga all aboard, the world's yours.
So I puff the herb to levitate.
Living my life, a God I got faith.
Y'all nigga faker than making your own bait.
Flatbush, Beast.
Coast nigga, all day.
All about peace and love, of course knowledge.
Spreadin' they own peace, they lovin' it cause I'm God sent.
Ever since a kid, I was never one to gossip.
So watch how you talkin' when you talkin' to them prophets, nigga.
