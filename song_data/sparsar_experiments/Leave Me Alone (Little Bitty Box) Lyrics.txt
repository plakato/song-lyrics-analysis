Leave Me Alone (Little Bitty Box) Lyrics
by 40 Glocc.

Suga Free.
Dollar bill y'all.
Shit.
Somethin' I can feel, y'all.
Why you bullshittin'.
Shadow on the 619.

Oh, here motherfucker, since you wanna go fetch.
On my worst day, you couldn't fuck with me at your best.
I know you hate it when I show up.
Tow up.
Probably cause you know I break a bitch and I'm about to blow up.
Now it's hoe season.
Motherfuckin' so why bitch.
That you hatin' and contemplatin' on a real pimp for no apparent reason.
That I beat the situation and I'm hot.
Recognized that you hatin', cause I got them trick waitin'.
Back to back, fuck a 'Llac.
And a rat, like that.
Oh, you fuckin' with a pimp.
And you will get slapped.
That's what a pimp do.
Break you.
And get rid of you.
And make you tell 'em other players what I did to you.
You bitch, you hoe, you slut.
Better recognize game before I fuck you up.
Now what you waitin' for?
I'll let a bitch pimp me when pushed.
You don't sell no more and make dildos out of playdough.

If, you, don't.
Leave me, alone.
I'm, gone.
Lock you in that little bitty box again, bitch.
If, you, don't.
Leave me, alone.
I'm, gone.
Lock you in that, lock you in that.
Little bitty box again.

I had a bad ass bitch with a caramel tone.
So I put my back in my bone, and mack in my tone.
Told her, Shut the fuck up, and sit in the back of the broom.
Snatch my cheese up quick and kick the back with a shroom.
Cause we don't love them hoes and.
A bitch ain't worth a shit with no gold.
So I hit the club to cop more.
Y'all know.
It's Suga Free and 40 Glocc in Dego.
With Mr. Shadow all the way from Colton to Seattle.
And back to Pomona.
Hoes to promote the corner.
Hit me on my two-way Motorola.
I got a whole lot of soldiers that love to throw boulders.
It's all over, test the faith and bleed slower.
The heat Blaze Just that fast, give me Hovah.
I want the cash and the ice and the keys to the Rover.
Tricky gotta kick cheese to meet, nigga, to ball, blow up.
Biotch.

I said, She's A Hoe.
Her friend's a hoe.
If you ain't about trickin', then your ass gotta go.
From the open toe pumps to the way that you move.
I'm a show you how a ese from the S.D. do.
Straight act a fool, got you making me loot.
Got you standing on the corner and that ass look cute.
And you know when the fuck I'm comin' 'round the block.
With the homey So G, Suga Free and 40 Glocc.
It don't stop, we stay pimpin'.
Bitch, why you trippin'.
Don't hate the playa, hate the game.
You damn chicken.
Stickin', no lickin'.
That's the motto.
And boy, the life I life.
Is hard to swallow.
Make your shit hollow, real quick, don't try to follow.
So pimp playa, pit bosses smokin' in a hot model.
Don Shadow, makin' ya bitch clip tricks.
She employee of the month when it comes to servin' dicks.
Ha ha.
