No Time at All Lyrics
by The Virus.

Life's going faster I run out of time.
If I can't see clearly I just might lose me mind.
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say.
And sometimes I fell like I get in the way.
You don't like me and I don't like you.
We need to figure out just what to do.
Denied, Deprived, a f**king war in my head.
The clock keeps on ticking until we are dead.

There's no time at all.
There's no time at all.
You better act fast now.
Your gonna fall.

Life's going faster I run out of time.
If I can't see clearly I just might lose me mind.
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say.
And sometimes I fell like I get in the way.
You don't like me and I f**king hate you.
We need to figure out just what to do.
Denied, Deprived, a f**king war in my head.
The clock keeps on ticking until we are dead.

There's no time at all.
There's no time at all.
You better act fast now.
Your gonna fall.
