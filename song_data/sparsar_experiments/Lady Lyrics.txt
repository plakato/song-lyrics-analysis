Lady Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Once when I was daily growing.
Dressed in red from head to toe.
You were all the thoughts I was knowing.

And the sun gave shine, no care the season.
While I learned my one, two, three's and.
You fell in to teach me treason.

And now I spend my each day busy.
Jumping on the monkey show.
Jumping on the monkey show.
Searching for a face I know.

And I just walk for hours.
Down the red-brick march of Market Street.
Of Market Street.

And Lady, she's all right with me.
Done borrowed all my empathy.
Now you know she got the best of me.
Cause she's not lying next to me.

And all things fine, sweet day beginning.
I got up and fell right in and.
Climbed up to where you was living.

And you stood in the backdoor yawning.
And I caught where you ease me on.
You're the reason I wake each morning.

And sunshine plays the puddles.
Through the mornings, evenings, afternoons.
Evenings, afternoons.
I count my thoughts with coffee-spoons.

And something reeks of Heaven.
'Neath the highway where the hobos sleep.
Where the hobos sleep.
And laugh about the pains I keep.

And Lady, she's a friend of mine.
Cause I know how to take my time.
But I can't say that without lyin'.
So I'll try not to try next time.

And I got no one to bear my burden.
Though I could pay with sips of wine.
All men like me just tuck their shirts in.
Too busy runnin' out of.
Do my best to do without, still.
Too busy runnin' out of time.

Well Lady, I can't take no rest.
With all this weight across my chest.
Yesterday I loved the best.
Done borrowed too much happiness.
