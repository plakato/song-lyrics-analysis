Loveless Lyrics
by 4hero.

As we await.
Sister Sun's arrival.
Child stars you'll listen.
To my tale, please stay.

As it was told to me.
By my sister afar.
Earth her name.
And this, this is her story:.

Sister Moon.
Hear me now.
I feel my end too soon, too soon!

My wounds.
Are deep.
Gaping.
Unhealing.

Can't believe, refused to believe.
My children had no feelings.
For me.

See.
Them sealing a fate of early death and destruction.
Watch my my foolish daughters and sons.
As they.
Kill me.
Slowly.
Kill me.
Quicker.
Kill me.

They've loved me as would an unfaithful lover.
Part-time and half-assed.
Now unmasked.
Is their deceit.
No more sweet.
Sneaky thrill seekings.
Tomorrow brings.
Nevers and nothings.
Ended days.
For my world.
And its unchanging ways.
Now.
Apocalyptic truths.
Of revelations hasten our omega.
My children's and mine.
Each time.
My breath, skin and tears are polluted and poisoned by their careless games.
and toys and.
This is only the beginning.
Of my children's sinning.

My power is fading.
You suck, brother.
Mother earth's now a plaything.
For the ungrateful child.
So cold.
Ten billionfold.
My tears.

I long for the once adoring embrace of my children.
Their prayers, their care and.
Tenderness.
Has now turned loveless.
The embrace.
Now an anaconda's grip.
Unmerciful and swift.
Swift with the killing.

Killing is a sport.
Fun with fire and my wondrous rainforests reflect the neglect they have for.
their main source.

They slaughter their sibling blossoms and beasts like the first murderer, Cain.
Their pure sister oceans will never be the same due to daily spoil and brother.
sky's choked from oil.
Refinery factory smoke.
Your mother earth found me, dying, note who's crying.
Now.

My power is fading.
You suck, brother.
Mother earth's now a plaything.
For the ungrateful child.
So cold.
Ten billionfold.
My tears.

But I'll continue to spin.
Until my curious home sapien.
Offspring pay the price for their sins.
Against my tainted tears, my breathless breath and once-fertile skins.
My sons are million-murderers.
They kill - I kill one million plus.
I never wanted to hurt my children but our creator makes me take revenge.
It's the circle of life -.
Or at least.
It was.

But now it's the end.

No, no it's too late for repentance.
Accept your death sentence.
I've given you all I can.
Such beauty and life.
You'll never have again.

Now it's the end.
Now it's the end.
Now it's the end.

Now it's the end.
