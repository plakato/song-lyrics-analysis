LookOut Lyrics
by 4th Pyramid.


Why stay so high? Cause I can't take it.
Watching all the days go by, dying to make it.
Life in a house of cards, trying to ace it.
Living in a hall of mirrors, but I won't face it.
Cords, mics, and my wackiest plans.
Got me still stuck with low-lifes, baggies, and grams.
My career rose from the dead to over your head.
Obama's in power, still some soldier just bled.
Overly fed, in the booth I'm a glutton.

My mind thinks of shit like llamas in space.
Smoke trees, fuck bitches -- guess I'm a disgrace.
