Clap Your Hands Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.


Now, what you in the party for, if you can't get down on the floor, 
So what she ain't checking for ya, don't let that one girl destroy ya 
For every dime! That'S on the floor, there's about a hundred more 
Steady coming through the door. So what are you waiting for? 
You and yo boys came to mack cuz ya'll know where the parties at 
So hot you might suffocate, but ya'll not tryin. To leave this place. 
Got on ya, tightest gear, competition's, pretty fierce 
Grab that girl don't let her go. No matter if the song is fast or slow, 
B-section 
That's right, fellas ya'll came here to dance 
Get off the wall. Let me see you wave yo hands 
That's right. Ladies ya'll came here to groove 
Grab, a fella that you like now, everybody move 
You might have to call the cops. 
Let me see you dance- dance 
Let me see those hands hands. 
Cuz, the party never stops 
1-2-3 Comin' 
 
Clap your hands just a little bit louder, 
Stomp your feet. If you came to party 
We are in here and there ain't no trouble. 
We just want ya'll to move ya bodies, 
Clap your hands just a little bit louder. 
Stomp your feet: if you came to party 
We are in here and there ain't no trouble. 
We just want ya'll to move ya bodies. 
 
Party's been goin for hours now, 
You just got out the shower now: 
Get dressed unwrap ya, hair 
Tell, your girls you'll meet'em. There 
Jump in your ride, doing 65 
You in the mood to get crunked up tonight. 
B-Section 
That's, right, fellas ya'll, came here to dance 
Get off the wall. Let me see you wave yo hands 
That's right. Ladies ya'll came here to groove 
Grab, a fella that you like now, everybody move, 

Breakdown 
Front back side to side up down, left to right, 
Front, back side to side up down, left to right;
