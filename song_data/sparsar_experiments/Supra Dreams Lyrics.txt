Supra Dreams Lyrics
by QuayChronicles.


Way back when I had a 93 Nissan.
My only thought was how could I be on.
Round the same time I was eatin TV dinners.
Mama told me get out and be a winner.
And I agree I can't see me livin a lie.
Mama stressin' with tears inner eyes.
Wonderin' how the bills gon' be paid off.
Lights fuckin' wit her and she just got laid off.
With that in mind I worked overtime.
For minimum wage and mom's peace of mind.
Even during the times of hardly makin' ends meet.
Still had dreams of pushin' a clean Supra down 71st Street.
My... Supra Dreams!

Yeah! Now who gon' kill my drive?
Can't kill this vibe!
Who gon' kill my drive?
Not while I'm alive.
Nah, you won't kill this drive!
Look into my eyes, won't kill this drive.
Not while I'm alive!
Pedal to the floor.
It's my... Supra Dreams!

Round the time I was pushin' a 00 Mustang.
Duckin' Sallie Mae payments each birthday.
Cleanin' dirty ass bathrooms for a paycheck.
I was wonderin' why my life wasn't made yet.
Been strugglin', grindin but no payoff in sight.
Got me hustlin', no days off just to stay right.
My light feel dimmer like blessings been skippin'.
Dreams slippin' breakin' down like the car I'm whippin.
But, my pen kept movin'.
Heart kept beatin, my schemes still loomin'.
Sleep deprived but when I closed my eyes.
Double entendre life dreamin' 'bout my drive.
My... Supra Dreams!

Thinkin' this is it in my leased SUV.
No watch, but God made time for me.
Through the years my skills sharpened-- never slow, boy.
And bullets may kill me, but not the soul, boy.
Whoa, boy! These supra dreams ain't leavin', see.
Imma be grindin for Moms, state, and me.
Cause we know I can't sleep on any of my mission.
Until my closed eyes visions come into fruition.
Until Melanie Fiona give me a date in Miami.
Or me and Janelle Mona√© in tuxes at the Grammys.
As long as my family sittin good as the number 7.
And I got my 96 Supra, sittin' on Heaven.
My... Supra Dreams!!!
