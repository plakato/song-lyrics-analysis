Bang Your Head (Mental Health) by Quiet Riot Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

I'm an axe grinder, pile driver.
Mama says that i never, never mind her.
Them old reins, i'm insane.
The teacher says that i one big pain.
I'm like a razor, six string razor.
I got a mouth like an alligator.
I want it loader, more power.
I'm gonna to rock it, till it strikes the hour.

Bang your head.
Metal health will drive you mad.
X2.
I,m frustrated and out dated.
I really won't to be overrated.
I'm a finder and i'm a keeper.
I'm not a loser and i ain't no weeper.
I got the boys to make the noise.
Won't ever let up, hope it annoys you.
Join the pack, fill the crack.
Well now your here,theres no way back.

Metal health will cure you crazy.
Metal health will cure you mad.
Metal health is what we all need.
Its what were all about.
Bang your head wake the dead.
We're all mental mad, its all you have.
So bang you head, and raise the dead...
Metal health,it drives you mad mad mad.

Ah get your straight jackets on tonight ohh.
The bad boys are gonna set you right.
Oh rock you rock rock you.
