by Quiet Riot.

I'M an axe, grinder pile driver 
Mama says that i never never mind her 
Them old reins. I'M insane. 
The teacher says that i one big pain 
I'm like a razor six string. Razor 
I got a mouth like an alligator 
I want it loader more power, 
I'm gon na to rock it till it strikes the hour. 
 
Bang, your head, 
Metal health will drive you mad 
X2, 
I m frustrated and out dated 
I, really won't to be overrated. 
I'M. A finder and i'm a keeper 
I'm, not a loser, and i ain't no weeper 
I got the boys to make the noise 
Won't ever. Let up hope it annoys. You 
Join the pack fill the crack 
Well. Now your here theres no way back 
 
Metal health will cure you, crazy, 
Metal health will cure you. Mad 
Metal health is what we all need 
Its. What were all about? 
Bang, your head, wake, the dead, 
We're, all mental mad, its all. You have 
So. Bang! You head and raise the dead.. 
Metal health. It drives you mad mad. Mad 
 
Ah get your straight jackets on tonight. Ohh 
The, bad boys are gon na set you right, 
Oh rock you rock rock you
