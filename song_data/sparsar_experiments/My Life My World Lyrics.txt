My Life My World Lyrics
by The Virus.

You do exactly what you want to.
And you answer to no one.
You live exactly how you want to.
For you today has just begun.

It's my life - I choose to.
It's my life - so f**k you.

Never surrender.
It's my life and my world.

You always have to have your own way.
So why would you want to change right now?
It's my life and I want to have my say.
No one can tell me that, oh no.

It's my life - I choose to.
It's my life - so f**k you.

Never surrender.
It's my life and my world.

It's my world - I choose to.
It's my life - so f**k you.

Never surrender.
It's my life and my world.
