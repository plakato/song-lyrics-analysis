Viktor's Sister Lyrics
by Viza.

Runaway to a far and distant land.
Where fools fall in love knee deep in sand.
Hold your breath till her vultures come to pass.
For you are a dove limp on her grass.

Getaway and never bring her back.
She's cruel like a clock turning too fast.
In a dream dressed in a long and silky robe.
She will become white as a ghost.

Viktor's sister uglified.
Viktor's sister petrified.
Viktor's sister!
Viktor's sister crucified.
Viktor's sister mortified.
Viktor's sister!

She's well on her way, well on her way to reach the stars.
She's well on her way, well on her way to break your heart.
She's well on her way, well on her way to kiss the sky.
She's well on her way, well on her way to live a lie.

Stay away you nymphomaniac.
Your breasts may be soft, but they are no match.
For my gun is powered by the sun.
With God as my witness, your evening has come.
