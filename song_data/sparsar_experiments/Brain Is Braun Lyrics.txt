Brain Is Braun Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Must be video cameras I'm causing a scene/.
Lost In dreams/ my style on parole, broke out of jail free/.
Yeah yeah I'm on U of T/ and York.
Keele Campus map/.
Rhyming lecture, yeah yeah this be for real and f*ck rap/.
Listen, my position is Afghanistan/.
No English, Soviet, Taliban or American/ goes.
With every one of their intricate half-ass plans/ shows.
That can ever make me move from where I'm standing/ woah!
I'm gonna seal your crypt/ deal with it/ read me like an.
Wide Open book, too bad so sad you're illiterate/.
I'm the ballistic/ mystic/ every track I'm spitting is cryptic/.
Except this/ accept it/ or I'll take your wack record and wreck it! /.
Act with knowledge/ cause y'all sure acknowledge/.
I demolish/ like a Facebook.
status, there's no dislike option/.
I'll Pop pimples on your brain/.
while you're simple and plain/.
I hit the ground running hard while you're limping away/.

Brain or Braun? / My brain is Braun/.
That G on E, that's why he's gone/.
Didn't catch the pun? / Spell it out/.
My brain is braun, can't sell it out/.

Every journalist I'm conversing with.
Knows my verbiage is superfluous.
I came from the firmament.
Way before the birds and fish.
My cursive script creates life, kinda like a hydrothermal vent.
My deep literature reaches extreme temperatures.
I don't do autographs I leave my heat signature.
Breath control like a rebreather its ridiculous.
Sweet Jesus he brings demons and heat seeking Greek legions with each speech.
And now you knee deep in it.
Thinking im' cheef keef, bleep bleep keep listening!
Im Deep like what's beneath the sands of Egypt.
Deeper than Stanton Friedman.
Deeper than an amniocentesis on the fetus of Jesus.
Deeper than Trina's vaginal regions.
It's so egregious they can't believe it.
Haâ€¦..well take your time and spell it out.
My Brain is Braun Ill never sell it out.

I've invested my time and drawn the fine line.
Overdosed on reality falling from cloud nine.
Now I plan for the future, live for the moment.
The poison that is poverty is all too potent.
Men drink away all the stress of the day.
An old woman walks by me begging for change.
I know many a man who stash crack and pack pistols.
Plenty of friends who turned rat, mad issues.
To put is as a curse is something that I'll never do.
I put it in to words but don't place me on a pedestal.
These are just my thoughts and they're something that I will express.
Never dumb it down cause my pride is in my intellect.
Never the less, I rep for my set.
West end, Mabelle, Reality Check.
This is real hip hop, ink to papyrus.
Catch me in the ends rolling up with the pirates.
