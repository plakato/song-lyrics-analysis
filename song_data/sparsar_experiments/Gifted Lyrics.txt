Gifted Lyrics
by Xc.


Lately I been just gettin like 4 hours of sleep eating just once a day.
Guess thats kinda ironic so much shit is on my plate.
Damn it I'm gone you can tell em I'm on my way.
Said that I'm gone and why would I wanna stay.
When nothing is here for me and thats been clear to me.
But naw I ain't shocked and ain't none of this weird to me.
I told em its our time they ain't taking this year from me.
And I get upset when bitch niggas say they ain't hear from me.
Cause thats what hoes do don't you got a phone too.
I'm into taking fast steps I never been social.
Its crazy how niggas think they can head to where I'm headed.
But they ain't never gotta go thru the shit I go thru.
So where was u when I was getting my life together.
Staying up late nights getting my writing better.
Oh I remember you was chasing them same hoes.
Still tryna convince me that your night was better.

I sent the message I'm guessing you didn't get it.
Care less about the present when ya gifted.
Just listen I told em I want my credit the told me you couldn't spend it.
So get ya money and pay attention.
And look at the shit I'm making not at the shit I'm missing.
Not worried bout the present cause I'm gifted.
Just listen I did it because I love it never for recognition.
More about all the followers less about all the mentions I swear.

Yeah I'm gone you can go and tell em I'm outta here.
I'm still on top of it all like some outerwear.
These niggas infatuated with being thousandaires.
I'm tryna get a million just give me about a year.
I'm headed to the top and they can watch me there.
Start taking the right steps then niggas gotta stare.
And they tell me I work to hard for what.
Man them niggas ain't working hard enough.
I'm writing everyday run back and forth from the booth.
And I still get to see my kids lil more than they mothers do.
I tell em the World is yours its whatever you wanna do.
Tryna search for success shit I got so much to lose.
And these haters watching my fucking steps.
Tryna see if I'm traveling guess they wanna ref.
We just wanna ball I swear to God we wanna ball.
Putting in overtime while dodging a sudden death.

And I promise I'm more gifted.
Than a 3 year old cancer patient with 4 wishes.
Who just went thru chemo and might not make it and had 54 visits.
With some rich grandparents just hours before christmas.
And alot of niggas was dissing man.
But I let it slide I be the bigger man.
Now I'm the president you'd swore that a nigga ran.
I'm sprinting my way thru life I got expensive plans.
Whats up Himes they know whats up.
Thats why I show em up everytime I'm showing up.
I'm running shit now and I'm feeling like Peyton Manning.
But they ain't want me on the team they'd rather go with luck.
I try'd to tell em its Big Business.
They told me abort the mission nigga you just kidding.
I said that I ain't need no plan B but they didn't listen.
Later I'mma show em I'm the heir now I'm just venting.
