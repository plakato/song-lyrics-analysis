Forever Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Oh yeah, we thought forever wouldn't be this in silence.
Oh yeah, and we still love the feeling, baby it don't matter.
Tell me now, why we gotta let love down?
Why've we gotta let love down?
Why've we gotta let love down?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.

Oh yeah, we thought forever wouldn't be this in silence.
Oh yeah, and we still love the feeling, baby it don't matter.

Why've we gotta let love down?
Why've we gotta let love down?
Why've we gotta let love down?
Why've we gotta let love down?

Ah, ah, ah, ah. ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah. ah.

Calm down at my house.
Believe it will be fine.
Let forever break the dark.
Give in to.

Tell me now, why we gotta let love down?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.
Why've we gotta let love down?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.
Ooh.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Ooh.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

We still love the feeling don't matter.
