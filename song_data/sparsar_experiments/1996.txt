Yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah 
Heyyyy 
Uh huh 
Ok, I'm back up on my BS im rappin to random sophias 
Spittin, like Blake griffin, hoppin and jumpin over kias 
Ready, to make my entrance with my ten cents, adjacent 
That's, a dime and it will get spent so face it. 
Ok so honesty the policy 
Girl. I always wrap it up. So I promise it is not a seed 
Bada boom. It wasn't me 
Shaggy shit, no Scooby, Doo 
Man that booty polluted brodie, I'm movin through 
Life with a vision. Can you question it? 
I am legend shit 
I'm moving through this world when no ones left in it 
Goin through the mall talking to random manikins 
Between. Two Americas relate to Panamanians 
Doctors testing, how sane he is 
That's, erroneous, I'm all there so digest that, like a pancreas 
I'm in a league, you can't be in Juwanna man 
See its niggas, like you playin the game with a tutu 
Rockin, a rappin costume. I couldn't tell you whos, who 
I hope- yall start to faze out like isuzus 
Im inebriated kinda wavy, like a booze cruise 
But. Damn why I choose to talk about you now: 
It's, a lose-lose 
I need these presidents to represent me 
Capitalizing off the talent that the heaven sent me. 
Im tryna run from my shadows, but they never left me 
They. Never let me be 
I hope you get me. 
The light is all that we see
