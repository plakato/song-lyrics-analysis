Modesto Lyrics
by Quiet Desperado.

I like to visit my hometown, twenty one and full grown now.
And see bitches that wouldn't give me a chance.
Bare foot and pregnant without dad pants.
He left her alone with a child on the way.
I guess this cat wanted to stay stray.
So now she's working a job at a dead end.
Can't buy new clothes, she got good at the Hemmingway.
Ernest with her future, but it's still bleak.
I don't really care because she called me a freak.
I don't hold grudges but I don't pull punches.
Go to the dollar store, whore and buy a week's worth of lunches.
Or just buy cereal, just bunches.
Your dude has a six pack of beer, no crunches.
You know what my hunch is? This situation is dumb shit.
You should have met me because I wouldn't jump ship.

But I still have feelings and I feel you.
I've been fucked over too, I know what you've been through.
Lost my viriginity to a girl who didn't like me much.
She moved to Sonora and let every guy touch.
Her and fuck her, she fell into a slut slumber.
Fuck you Sasha, I can say that in my rap tumblr.
