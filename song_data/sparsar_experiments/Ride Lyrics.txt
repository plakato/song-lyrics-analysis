Ride Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

Yeah!

Full throttle with my head laid back.
The rail road tracks I ride!
I see the lights from the train come fast.
That shit makes me high!
I like the way I feel when death is near my only friend!
This is the fun ride, the beginning of the end!

Come on and ride!
Come on and ride!
Come on and ride....
To hell with me.

Mile high on a one way trip and lookin to get up speed!
Hold tight on my handle grips till my hands start to bleed!
I like the feelings of being up close with cliffs on left to right!
210 and I'm half way there and the po's ain't feelin' so tight!

Come on and ride!
Come on and ride!
Come on and ride....
To hell with me.

C'mon, c'mon.
Hey!
C'mon, c'mon.
Hey!
C'mon, c'mon.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Yeah!

Come on and ride!
Come on and ride!
Come on and ride....
To hell with me, with me!
Come on and ride, yeah!!
Come on and ride, yeah!
Come on and ride....
To hell with me, with me, with me!
Come on and ride, yeah!!
Come on and ride, yeah!
Come on and riiiiide....
To hell wiiiith me!!!
