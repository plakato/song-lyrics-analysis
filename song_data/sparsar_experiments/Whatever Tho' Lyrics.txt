Whatever Tho' Lyrics
by Woodie.


I might of shot your homies.
Once or twice you never know.
But I still walk the streets.
So I assumed they let it go.
But just in case they didn't.
I pack metal for clever folks.
So all that talk in breakin' Woodie off.
Whatever tho'.

Woodie.
I'm still puttin' it down.
Sidin' through the town Yoc bound.
Suckas wanna talk down.
But ain't prepared to cock down.
They wanna bang like killas.
But don't bang with no killas.
They wanna claim they killas.
But don't hang with no killas.
This is Antioch, the A-N-T-I-O-C-H.
And I'm the one who brought the Yoc.
Up out the Golden State.
You wanna hate this.
Hate yourself.
Think your from the Yoc.
Talkin' down on my name.
Cuz I ain't askin' you to jock.
Just recognize.
From two professional years of rappin'.
East Co. Co. Records puttin' this.
crap.
Back in time on the map.
And then some.
We takin' nationwide infected.
Each and every nook and cranny.
Were that Yoc life bakins'.
And I reckon.
We'll be collectin' dividends along the way.
And that's exactly were this haterism comes into play.
What's there to say.
Nothin' but hot ones.
I got for those talkin' down on me.

Woodie.
Come on haters try to stop this.
Dig deep into your pockets.
Cuz that'll give me a legit reason.
To make yo knot twist, not this.
Northern fella Antioch dwella.
Won't fall hostage.
To the thoughts and plots of the jealous.
Your gonna watch this.
Independent label succeed.
Were re-precautions 10-4 for.
Every homey that bleeds.
We'll plant our seeds in some mattress.
And watch our killas grow.
Teach 'em everything we know.
So that they gonna run the show.
I'm talkin' fathers and sons.
Uncles and nephews packin' guns.
Holdin' down the fort.
Prepared for war.
Protectin' loved one.
No more snatchin' up our dreams.
Through the dope on triple beams.
Or an enemy shot.
Cuz that's the power money brings.
We're the kings of our own plot.
We found a spot.
Don't make room.
If you think we're bluffin'.
I assume you have a skank too.
So if you wanna get me.
Come and get me.
Quit talkin'.
And send the messages through bitches.
Cuz that shit'll leave you chopped up.

Woodie.
You wanna talk behind my back.
And jaw jack amongst female company.
And every word up out your mouth.
Eventually gon' come to me.
How dumb could you be.
Maybe you really wanna see me.
But most likely you a sucka.
And you hatin' you can't be me.
Probably got that A-D-D.
Attention Deficit Disorder.
And you've notice when you say my name.
That people won't ignore ya.
That's pathetic.
Just another sorry chump in the game.
Go ahead keep bumpin' my name.
Cuz your just pumpin' my fame.
But when we cross paths.
Haul ass.
Or be prepared to aim.
Cuz I'm a draw fast.
Cock blast.
With heat to tear your brain.
Cuz I've HAD IT UP TO HERE.
echoes.
Do your history.
I got my stripes.
Sucka you ain't pumpin' fears.
So come here and get a dose of.
This Antioch West Twompsta.
The demon in me wants to.
Go back to a monsta.
And put this music shit on stand by.
To make a man die.
How do I cope with this.
I focus on the grand prize.

Nothin' but hot ones I got for those talkin' down on me.

Shit! echoes out.
