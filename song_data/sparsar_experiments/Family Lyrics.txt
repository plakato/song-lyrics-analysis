Family Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


I gotta live for my family.
No I can't die today.
I gotta live for my family.
So I wake up and I pray.

I gotta live for my family.
No I can't die today.
I gotta live for my family.
So I wake up and I pray.

Moerolla, that's my best friend.
She's my right hand, nigga that's my left hand.
Karolina, that's my mama.
She with me right or wrong, even in the drama.
My father, that nigga crazy.
Got 2 kids and they both amaze me.

The streets is shady.
They shady.
I just pray to god that the streets don't take me.
Do it for the family, do it for the fans.
Gotta get this money, that is in my plan.
Do it for the family, do it for the fans.
These niggas out here snitchin', I won't take a stand.

Why you wanna testify, nigga?
Why you make my family cry, nigga?
Why you want me to die, nigga?
Why you gone testify, nigga?

Errytime I come outside.
It just be a homicide.
Please don't make my mama cry.
I wanna live, I don't wanna die.
This is how I gotta live, born broke, I'll die rich.
? just to feed my kids, EBT fill up the fridge.

Fightin' for my life when I'm in the streets.
I be goin' in but I miss a ?
Fightin' for my life when I'm in the streets.
Please don't kill me, don't kill my family.

Lil Nario, nigga rest in peace.
Stubby ENT, nigga that's the family.
Lil Nario, nigga rest in peace.
Stubby ENT, nigga that's the family.
Lil Nario, nigga rest in peace.
Stubby ENT, nigga that's the family.
