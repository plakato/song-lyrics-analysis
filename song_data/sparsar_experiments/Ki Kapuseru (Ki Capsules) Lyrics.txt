Ki Kapuseru (Ki Capsules) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Oh shit, I'm drowning in that acid, nigga, oh fuck ,I don't even know, oh,.
whooo, waaaaaaaaaan.

A nigga like me gonna smoke everythang.
All my niggas smoke everythang.
If you come through with a sack, you ain't getting it back, bitch.
We smoking all of that.
All my bitches know, if they're trying to chill they gonna need a sack and.
some pills, thats just a deal.
I'mma keep it real, because thats what I do, thats what I gotta do.
All these niggas trying to hate on me, theyre some dam fools.
Get your ass put up on the news, waaaaaan.
And your momma gonna be sad too, waaaaaan.
Fuck your family,nigga, its what I do, waaaaaan.
I don't give a fuck about you, waaaaaan.
I'm on some acid trying to get some more, waaaan.
And I got my ho on it too, waaaaan.
All her friends trying to come through, waaaaaan.
They wanna fuck, so they getting nude, waaaaaaan.

Dr. Phil, poppin pills, counting hundred dollar bills x2.
Dr. Phil, Dr. Phil, popping all these pills.
Dr. Phil, Dr. Phil, counting hundred dollar bills.
Dr. Phil, Poppin pills, popping pills.
Popping all these pills and I'm counting all these bills.
Dr. Phil, Dr. Phil.
Dr. Phil, popping pills, counting hundred dollar bills x2.
