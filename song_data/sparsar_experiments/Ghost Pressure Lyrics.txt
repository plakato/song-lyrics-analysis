Ghost Pressure Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.


Baby, I just don't understand.
Make me feel like another man.
And I kissed you there on Orchard Road.
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.
Pulled the car from the empty street.
Empty room and empty sea.
I know they're dancing there invisibly.
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.
She said:.

Little vision come shake me up, shake me up.
Little vision come shake me up, shake me up.
Little vision come shake me up, shake me up.
Little vision come shake me up, shake me up.

Said your heart was a swarm of bees.
And they don't and they will never leave.
I hear them buzzing there invisibly.
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.
And now it's just you and me.
Well, I could do a little mystery.
And you just had to know.
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.

A little vision come, come and shake me up.
A little vision come, come and shake me up.
A little vision come, come and shake me up.
A little vision come, come and shake me up.

Dan Boeckner  x2.
Ghost pressure come shake me up, shake me up.

Ghost pressure come shake me up, shake me up.
