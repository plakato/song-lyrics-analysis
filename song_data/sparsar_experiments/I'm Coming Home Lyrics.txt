I'm Coming Home Lyrics
by Xazz.


You'll never know how much I, love you girl.
Wish I could show how much I, love you girl.
I guess you got the blues baby doll, and.
Take me home, I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.

It's been so long since I been, with you girl.
Wish I could reach out and just kiss you girl.
I said I'd give all my loving to you, my sweet, sweet baby darling.
I just wish you could have know, I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.

Instrumental.
