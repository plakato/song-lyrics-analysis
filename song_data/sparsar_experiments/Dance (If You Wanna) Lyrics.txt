Dance (If You Wanna) Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

So dance if you wanna, dance if you wanna.
So dance if you wanna, dance if you wanna.
Now I don't wanna see you cry.
So dance if you wanna, dance if you wanna.
No I don't wanna see you cry.
Don't wanna hear you say goodbye.
So dance if you wanna, dance if you wanna.
So dance if you wanna, dance if you wanna.
No I don't wanna see you cry.
Don't wanna hear you say goodbye.

No I don't wanna see you cry.
Don't wanna hear you say goodbye.
No I don't wanna see you cry.
Don't wanna hear you say goodbye.
Don't wanna hear you say goodbye.
Don't wanna see you say goodbye.
Goodbye, goodbye.
Don't wanna hear you say goodbye.
Dance if you wanna.

So dance if you wanna, dance if you wanna.
So dance if you wanna, dance if you wanna.
Now I don't wanna see you cry.
So dance if you wanna, dance if you wanna.
