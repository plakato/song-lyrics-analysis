Canibus Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Canibus.
I'm a nuclear warhead, right now you're provoking my detonation.
Never test me without proper authorization.
My lack of patience will cause me to get mad.
And explode right in front of your face like an airbag.
Your rhyme is fake, your brain is child's play to manipulate.
I create lyrics too intricate to imitate.
Moving at a velocity, that'll break your stop-watch if you're clocking me.

My concrete jungle is like Jumanji.
But iller than what you seen in the cinema.
A five foot eight nigga with more horsepower than twelve cylinders.
My brain consists of twin Pentium chips.
That's double the clock speeds of a 5-86.
And nothing about my physical matrix is basic.
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tasting.
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes.
It's like explaining color to a man that was born blind.
One of a kind, I got divine chromosomes in me.
My sperm will scramble the eggs in a women's ovaries.
Cause I'm as original as it gets.
And I can't respect, niggas that copy like double-decks.
I get vexed when crab punks bite my style.
Cause I'm selling a thousand records per day, per square mile.
Breaking the laws of physics, wit metaphors and lyrics.
Speaking to dead poets by conjuring up they spirits.
From Shakespeare to Edgar Allen.
Yo, the whole Dead Poets Society couldn't mess around with the talent.
Much less understand it.
I make tight-rope walkers in the circus lose they balance when I kick the.
planet.

*ooohs and aahhs*.

Sway.
Yo yo, microphones are smokin right now.
World Famous Wake-Up Show.
Jurassic 5, Canibus.
