Count to Five Lyrics
by Zo!.


How do you do?
I'm lovely, yes I'm feeling lovely, how are you?
The trees are green and know the sky's a lovely hue.
A brighter day for one, but better day for two.
Oh, but anytime I'm feeling blue.
There is a song I sing and I'll sing it for you.
It's kind of tricky, but I know you'll find the groove.
Or I could sing the words and you just hum the tune.
Oh, yeah.

The rain is coming, better get inside.
Lay down my love, and count to five.
Cause one's too lonely, and three's too soon.
Just count to five, and keep your cool.

Sample Break.
One, two three four five.
One, two three four five.
One, two three four five.
One, two three four five.

How do you do?
I'm lovely, yes I'm feeling lovely, how are you?
The trees are green and know the flowers are in bloom.
A lazy day in May or maybe even June.
I know the rain is coming soon.
To wash away the day and make it all brand new.
Nothing to fear, my dear, I know it to be true.
There's so much good in life if you just make the room.
Oh, but anytime I'm feeling blue.
There is a song I sing and I'll sing it for you.
It's kind of tricky, but I know you'll find the groove.
Or I could sing the words and you just hum the tune.
Oh, ah.

Sample Break.
