Sternum Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


When you carried me over the threshold.
To the room where we got tired and bold.
You held my hand up to your sternum.
Never learned how to talk to someone new.
But I guess that is an acquired truth.
So I'll meet you down around the bake sale.

Let's hear it for the things we did.
Did you forget about it.
Cold cocked and shaking like a fist.
Till' we grow around it.
Stupid bus to a stupid place.

All the miles between these nervous guts.
That won't cover the cost of my misconduct.
Better watch out, cause I'm on fire.

Let's hear it for the things we did.
Did you forget about it.
Cold cocked and shaking like a fist.
Till' we grow around it.
Stupid bus to a stupid place.
