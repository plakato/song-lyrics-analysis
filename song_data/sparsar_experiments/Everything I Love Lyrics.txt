Everything I Love Lyrics
by SWV.

I've known you long enough to know you ain't ballin' off.
Spendin' money as I'm spendin' time.
A million dollars ain't good enough.
How can we communicate if we don't speak?

Baby don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete.
Our hope is romantic, I can't stand this.
Never too much to be takin' this for granted.
Swear to God, I'm here for you.

Baby don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete.
Boy, you're my heart and I'm down for you rich or poor.

If you'll still be right here.
I put it all, everything I love.
You're my everything and it will hurt if you'll leave.

I'll still be right here.
I put it all, everything I love.
You're my everything and it will hurt if you'll leave.

We can move, but losing us ain't worth it.
And maybe I'm a hold on.
Like a pass and we drop the ball.
I'm incomplete.

Baby don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete.
Boy, you're my heart and I'm down for you rich or poor.

If you'll still be right here.
I put it all, everything I love.
You're my everything and it will hurt if you'll leave.

I'll still be right here.
I put it all, everything I love.

I know nothing lasts forever.
If we crawl we'll make it to the day after.
Uuu, there's my, it'd better be you and me.

Don't let nothing break us, let's keep it concrete.
Boy, you're my heart and I'm down for you rich or poor.

If you'll still be right here.
I put it all, everything I love.
You're my everything and it will hurt if you'll leave.

I'll still be right here.
I put it all, everything I love.

Boy, you're my heart and I'm down for you rich or poor.
If you'll still be right here.
I put it all, everything I love.
You're my everything and it will hurt if you'll leave.

I'll still be right here.
I put it all, everything I love.
