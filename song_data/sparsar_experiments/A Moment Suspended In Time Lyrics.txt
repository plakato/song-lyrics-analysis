A Moment Suspended In Time Lyrics
by Underoath.

Held captive, I'm a prisoner.
In the back room where the water leaks.
And I'm, oh, so cold.
Command me on what to do.
But we both know.
Neither you or I are in control.
There's nothing left for me here.
I'm grabbing on to what's left of this hole.
It's all too real, this can't be happening.
Never again, ever again, will I say I'm okay.
I'm scared of the fate that will become mine.
Become mine.
No time to talk.
No time to talk.
You know the drill.
Under my desk, this can't be it.
I'm only dreaming.

But I can't get up.
No time to talk, not this time.

This is where I arrange.
Under my desk, this can't be it.
I'm only dreaming.

But I can't get up.
No time to talk, not this time.

This is where I arrange.
It's so funny how we see things so clear.
When we have no time left to live.
So, lay back now.
And take it in.
I won't say a word.
So, lay back now.
And take it in.
And I won't say anything.
I can't believe how it feels.
To stand here in this room.
And feel like it's gonna blow.
I think we're all gonna blow.
Under my desk, this can't be it.
I'm only dreaming.

But I can't get up.
No time to talk, not this time.

This is where I arrange.
Well, I've got to be dreaming.

We've got to be dreaming.

We've gotta go.

I've got to be dreaming.

We've got to be dreaming.
Please, don't wake me up.
This is the end.
This is the end.
This is the end.
