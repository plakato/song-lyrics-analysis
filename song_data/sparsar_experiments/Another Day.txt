Another Day
by Volbeat.

Jumping on the next train.
And for a moment.
I just don't know where I am.
Sick and tired of seeing good people.
Bending over for the system that I hate.

Never meant to break your heart.
But for a moment I just know I have.
Give me time to cope my mind.
And finding faults for the reason.
To why I leave.

Most leave when I'm going strong.

Lead me away and I shall call love on you.
Leave me the way that I still burn over you.
I've been aware.

Sitting here in county jail.
I should have been with you.
But that's just how I am.
Ain't no one to go my bail.
But at least I know just when.
And how I leave.

Must leave when I'm going strong.

Lead me away and I shall call love on you.
Leave me the way that I still burn over you.
Well i've been waiting for years.
And I still call love on you.
Leave me the way that I still burn over you.

Well I've been aware.
