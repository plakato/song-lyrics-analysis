The Introduction Lyrics
by Swayzi.


Bombing all these suckers like Americans in Taliban.
You never catch me smiling like I'm proudly South African.
My jeans so it's like gravity is pulling them, I strike a pose and hold it.
like a fancy mall manican.
Call me Mr Boomarang cause I am always back again I take vacations down my.
mind like walking down memory lane.
Take a bite of this b*tch, Swayzi got the sugar cane.
Drip drop, drip drop.
Sorry that your top is stained.
An operating system man, you know that Swayzi run the game!
Target market : I'm shooting b*tches, that my aim...
You and a whole lot of shit just went down the drain.. and you's a lying n*gga.
only God can make it rain.
I can't believe it buddy, I just left the dro.
I talk a whole lot of shit like an asshole!
Geometrically f*cking f*ck a b*tch in angles, f*ck up your mind, you can say.
that I'm a vandal.
Boy I'm all up in your grill, call it tooth decay.
You are just a video so at the end you fade, and you's a retarded egg so you.
never get laid.
Boy my rhymes are so sick they need medical aid, and matter' fact they so sick.
? must hate.

I toss them in the river boy, just to rattle your cage, you've got to get your.
daily fix of the Swayzi dosage!
And don't mistake me for your powder boy, I'm not cocaine.
But I'm flying with the dead. That's the real soul plane.
I'm hot to 360 that's the last degree, weed over-lord if you ain't smoking.
then it's blasphemy.
And even though you had a gatt you wouldn't blast to me.
Cause I will take you for a ride, you need a ? seat.
And the rainbow nation different colours, but the same old sh*t.
Baby take a look into my eyes, do you like what you see?
