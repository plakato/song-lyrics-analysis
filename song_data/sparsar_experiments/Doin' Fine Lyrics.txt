Doin' Fine Lyrics
by Rusty.

You tried.
Our lips touched and you blew my mind.
We climbed to the top and you cut my line.
We drove for miles.
You look at me and I make you smile.
The first time.
You washed your truck and my heart flyed.
If you had the time.
You could have eased my mind.
You left me in the night.
I'm still wishin you were mine.
You went East and you left me blind.
I'm stuck here with all my guilt.
And your still doin' fine.
Time flies.
You call me and you state your mind.
I try to forget your face but it's on my mind.
