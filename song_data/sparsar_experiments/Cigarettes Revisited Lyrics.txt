Cigarettes Revisited Lyrics
by Russian Red.

Now tell me what it is, it isn't fair.
Cause Im wasting time, but it isn't my heart.
It isn't my fault.
And every situation understands, well.
The anecdote of chasing the location to your door.
Yeah yeah? da da?
Cause I'm wasting time, now Im wasting money again.
And all the cigarettes that I have never smoked.
And all the letters that I have never sent, da da?
And he was sitting by the swimming pool.
But he was scared, cause it wasn't his time, it wasn't his chance.
Getting olders not been on my plans.
But its never late, its never late enough for me to stay, da da?
Cause I'm wasting time, now I'm wasting money again.
And all the cigarettes that I have never smoked.
And all the letters that I have never sent, da da?
