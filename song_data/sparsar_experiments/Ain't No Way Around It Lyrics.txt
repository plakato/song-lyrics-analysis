Ain't No Way Around It Lyrics
by Wordplay.


Ay look my swag so mean, I go to therapy for that thang.
I get high as a plane while y'all niggas ride the train.
This Hispanic bitch is bad, nigga she beyond profane.
Lil' mama and her friends some chicken heads, Raising Canes.
Turned all up in the stars, imma codeine astronaut.
Imma killer all-star, like my nigga Juggernaut.
If I am out here tryna function then I'm gon need some pot.
All these bitches on me, so call me Sir Fucks-A-Lot.
A player gon be a player, no matter how you say it.
So if Word Play wants a bitch, then Word Play is gon pay for it.
Meets my criteria if she can twerk and work that pole.
In my red Adidas, I'm in steal your bitch mode.

Imma do whatever I want, so my name is Charlie Sheen.
Imma boss like Meek Mill or a college dean.
Put Saint Louis back on the map, check them damn books.
If you bring your girl to the club, she gon get took.
Hall of fame swag is what I got and what y'all lack.
And my crew running train on all these hoes like Amtrak.
In my room got racks on racks on racks on packs on packs on stacks.
Smoke that weed, get the munchies, then buy some Lil' Debbie snacks.
Niggas brought that kushie, now we about to take flight.
We somewhere in the heavens while you're fucking around with a kite.
Fuck what a hater say, imma do me, ?
Imma real muthafucking nigga ain't no way around it, cause a.
