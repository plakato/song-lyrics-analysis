You'll Never Be Better Than Me (I'm That Shit) Lyrics
by Queen Pen.


You dogs wanna know the life I live.
You dogs wanna see the things I did.
So much in this world is this shit.
It's just shit, just full of this.

Queen Pen.
Check it, on some down and dirty shit, Crown Height shit.
Is you life thugged out Benji style shit.
While you wanna front on your white style shit.
Praisin all your dough on some real bullshit.
I cops the high rent on land bitch.
Without being platinum that's that smart guy shit.
You talk about keys but never flip wiz kid.
The first to cop a pleed, that's that real hot shit.
Can't pick or choose wit click you wanna run with.
On the up and up that's that real crab shit.
Poppin mad shit on that mix tape shit.
But when it's time to face a heat, you on that other type shit.
I know what I did, what I seen, where I been.
While you capitalize of this life you done lived.
If you ask me that's some real bullshit.
Record called me suppin me up, fake artist shit.

You will never be better than me.
See you much too smart to me.
You will never be better than me.
See you much too smart to me.

Queen Pen.
Talkin about a life that you know you never lived.
You a studio gangsta phony artist shit.
Poppin twenty bottles but never leave bid.
That's that show off, big trick shit.
Makin trips outta town, I gotta survive type shit.
Cashin in my stamps to make the ends meet shit.
How do my niggas dose on some real legal shit.
On the low that's that real have your back type shit.
Stickin around with your baby daddy down in the shit.
That's the daily life we live straight strugglin type shit.
Wanna be with your don, on some Mark Pitts shit.
Fuckin around wit my click, get that face lift shit.
On your Ms. locked down, you outta bail type shit.
You a snitchin ass punk on that deep cover shit.
Never nigga.

Queen Pen.
We gets down for I's on some ghetto star shit.
'87, '99, we was legendary chip chicks.
On I-95, pushin big boy whips.
Six bricks in the trunk, that's that Braveheart shit.
We done done it, lived it, wit you still talkin shit.
And see a life thru your click, that's the fraudulent shit.
On some flippin now shit, gettin money typed shit.
Smokin purple haze every day, every night shit.
Bitches holdin grunges on that childish type shit.
And when the dough get low tell me where your click is.
We roll 50 deep on that war type shit.
Hittas in the trunk that's that real life shit.
First trip around on some lesson earth shit.
But this trip around, strictly QB shit.
Bystorm shit, some more real shit.
Up in ya face, stronjay type shit, ha.

I'm that shit, you that shit.
Everybody gonna wanna rock my shit.
