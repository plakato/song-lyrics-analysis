I Believe In You Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

No, I've never seen the sky.
As vanilla as tonight.
And it's here I hold you close.
When I finally close my eyes.
And it never ever fails.
The sun comes up, the story dies.
And I don't know why.

But baby, that's all I need.
Is someone like you burnin' through me.
Oh and it's never fair.
The way that we meet and you disappear.
No, it don't feel like sleep.
When I'm this alive it's true.
I believe in you, I believe in you, oh.

It's so hard to give you up.
But too easy to pretend.
Like the way the leaves would fall.
Tell the both of us would end.
What to tell my friends.

When baby, that's all I need.
Is someone like you burnin' through me.
Oh and it's never fair.
The way that we meet and you disappear.
No, it don't feel like sleep.
When I'm this alive, it's true.
I believe in you, I believe in you, oh yeah.

What you want isn't what you get.
Isn't what you want isn't what you get.
What you want isn't what you get.
Isn't what you want isn't what you get.

I believe in you.
What you want isn't what you get.
Isn't what you want isn't what you get.
I believe in you.
What you want isn't what you get.
Isn't what you want isn't what you get.

Cause baby, that's all I need.
Is someone like you burnin' through me.
Oh and it's never fair.
The way that me meet and you disappear.

Oh and it's oh' so real.
The way that we talk, the way that you feel.
Oh and I want to scream.
But I know the fault lies with me.

Cause I believe in you, hey.
I believe in you, I believe in you, oh, oh, oh, oh.
