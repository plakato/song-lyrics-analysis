Ms. Senioritis Lyrics
by Xavery Williams.


This is C.K from Pikeville Kentucky and you're listening to XaveryMusic
 
 
This is that song you heard playing… when you were dreaming 
Know. What I mean 
This is what you hear when you meditate… 
 
I should be studying, but I'm writing 
Not really feeling school at the moment. 
High classes go by like lightning 
I'm going to see this later and not remember when I wrote it 
 
The only curves that I care about are yours. 
I just want to do you like chores 
And, maybe study your anatomy. 
Good loving brings out the bad in me. 
 
Mixed girl, ingesting White Russian 
Now she's, yapping, like a Muppet 
The finger that pleases also hushes 
I hit it like. I hate her and she loves it. 
 
Rough sex
