Introduction Freestyle Lyrics
by Swifty.

Swifty.

Nobody better test me.
Cos I don't wanna get messy.
By messy I mean making rappers especially, Jay-Z wanna turn into singers.

And making fans throw up their hands by swallowing their fingers.
Bring this competition and face this meanin'.
Got your whole crew doing boys and sucking penis.
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius.
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters.
Keep it close, you still can't beat us.
Spitting bout our harsh life man you best believe us.
I done made mc leaders outta these non-rappin rejects.
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret.
Tryna steal your girl is my only mind state.
Makes it too late for you tryna raise up your game mate.
I'm like a R8, painful to people when they're been hit by the wheel.
The recoil is too much, to handle, eject and reload, fire the whiplalsh.
From these shells, how I bend 'em like root canals.
I erase all trails, pick up and eat the cartridges.
Now I'm metal mouth like braces as a child.
Keeping you and your crew as hostages for hours.
Sending you insane, my sick lyricist skills are as easy to see as a Virgin.
Media plane.
To the moon, you can't handle, makes you wanna kill an emcee with a spoon and a spanner.

Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels.
Butterflies so big it's flying your stomach out through your mouth.
You nervous now, everything is out when Swift's around, ay, vacate now.
Y'all dumb enough to actually try to front and escape, how?
Takes off his back pack, it's Al Qaeda wow!
Nah it's just Swift, pulling the gat from out his jacket.
Took this 9 and put in.
your face.
Quick you better run!
turns around, BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from London's south east.
Like I said no one is iller than me.
