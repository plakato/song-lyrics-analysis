Introduction Freestyle Lyrics
by Swifty.

Swifty 
 
Nobody, better test me 
Cos. I don't wan na get messy 
By messy. I mean making rappers, especially Jay-Z wan na turn into singers
 
And, making fans throw up their hands by swallowing their fingers 
Bring this competition and face this meanin' 
Got your whole crew. Doing boys and sucking penis 
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew genius 
Murder whoever's between us pack, your heaters, 
Keep, it close. You still can't beat us 
Spitting bout, our harsh life man, you best believe us 
I done made mc leaders outta. These non-rappin rejects 
While the whole world. Ejects your tape, it ain't no secret, 
Tryna steal. Your girl is my only mind state 
Makes it too late for you. Tryna raise up your game. Mate 
I'm, like a R8 painful to people when they're been hit by the wheel. 
The recoil is too much to handle eject and reload fire. The whiplalsh 
From, these shells how I bend'em like root, canals, 
I erase all trails pick up and eat the cartridges. 
Now, I'm metal mouth like braces as a child, 
Keeping you and your crew as hostages for hours. 
Sending you insane my sick, lyricist skills are as easy to see as a Virgin
Media plane. 
To, the moon you can't handle, makes you wan na, kill an emcee with a spoon and a spanner
 
Horrified and keep on frontin' repentin' and lose they bowels 
Butterflies. So big, it's flying your stomach out through your mouth 
You nervous. Now everything is out when Swift's around ay vacate now 
Y'all dumb enough to actually try to front and escape how 
Takes off his back pack, it's Al Qaeda, wow 
Nah. It'S just Swift, pulling the gat from out his jacket 
Took this 9 and put in
your face 
Quick. You better run 
turns around BLAAAOW 
It's Swifty from London's south east 
Like. I said no one is iller than me
