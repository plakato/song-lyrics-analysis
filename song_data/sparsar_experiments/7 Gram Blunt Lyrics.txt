7 Gram Blunt Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


Rolling up that hash and the 7 gram blunt.
I be smoking, smoking, smoking cause i'm never high enough.
Can't see the fucking room cause the windows fogging up.
Riding down the block 195 can't fuck with us.
Smoking like a fire, loud pack burning up.
Got that super strong, that now i'm gone, that 7 gram blunt.
Smoking by myself counting all this money up.
Smoking by myself on that 7 gram blunt.

Rolling up that sour d.
These nigga's can't fuck with me i do this shit so flawlessly.
That nigga be balling, bitch you see me on the court.
I be smoking, smoking, smoking, rolling up like it's a sport.
Kush be my cologne cause i'm hella smoked out.
I just hopped out the whip and i let the smoke out.
And I got my black shades so i'm hella lowed out.
If a nigga ever tripping i'm leave him choked out.
Stumped out, hit em up then we out.
Cause i don't fuck with niggas, yeah i bring the bitches out.
I bring the mommy's out, bitches from down south.
Bitches up in Cali but i'm from Miami.
Smoking on that Cali.
