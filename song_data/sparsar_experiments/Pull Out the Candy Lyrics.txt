Pull Out the Candy Lyrics
by Yungstar.

Big T - 2x.
Pull out the candy, cause it's time to shine.
Turn up the Screw, because it's going down.
Down South, we just balling mayn.
Steady sliding on chrome, in the turning lane.

Yungstar.
That Ike got me sprayed, cause I'm always playa made.
Don't even have to drive, to get parked in valet.
I'm leaving candy dropping, when I'm tipping tipping wet.
Elbows and dot the mirrors popped, and I got that beam set.
Bout to park, where I can peep out my scene.
Sitting on grown men, and every heiress has a screen.
After this shit beaming, cause I'm ready for the weather.
Dropping ashes on my buck, y'all original version of leather.
I swang from the North to the South, like a monster.
Enegland hard, cause it's still my name Yungstar.
I'm crystal clear no tint, I want these boys to see.
I'm on your local radio station, and your cable T.V.
I hear em saying Yung they stealing your style, they stealing your flow.
What's happening you still rapping, when your shit hit the sto'.
I tell em I'm still on my grind, I'm still on my note.
And plus I got my own label, so I'm fin to get mo'.

Yungstar.
Here I come here I come, I know you hear me coming.
Driving my bumper on Antoine, pick it up wait on Fondren.
I be money laundering from here to London, way to Thailand.
Boys and all the while on island, why I'm always smiling.
Stop that I always frown, let the top down.
Nigga like me I come down, I'm known to tech nine.
Check your crew wreck the blue, wreck the red.
I drop the top pull up, now I'm on the 'Stead.
Moving grooving, stretch nation wide.
Sipping satin, with them steering steady skating now.
Why I'm stop and go, nigga got a lot of golds.
A lot of shows, use to party at the Papa Deauxxx.
A lot of mo' wanna get me, catch me slipping.
All the trips and trade, cause the trades can be tricky.
Marble seven fifty, you can't miss me.
And just to sew it up, I got fo's going for fifty.

Yungstar.
I might jump out in flip-flops, and pajamas and a Clover flag.
Of that California love and purple stuff, every moment is a Kodak.
It's a known fact, when a shoulder break the wrist I could pull up.
I'ma throw black and you stroll back, and take a look at my footage.
What's that I'ma keep my crooked and X's, Screwston in cooking.

You can catch me at IHOP or Frank's, can sit with twenty guns.
To seeming love cash for later, have no less than twenty ones.
I make em say man, when the candy dance through your city.
Extra inches on our toys, separating the boys from the men.
Vada-ving vada-voom, fresh out to loon and detail.
Before you see me hear me riding, blowing big on Davin wheels.
Turning MLK to a one-way lane, Fondren and Main fondling grain.
Jump in the lane in something strange, with a bunch of bang ain't nothing.
changed.
You love to swang, go on fire it up you know what to do.
Pop and drop the top body rock, as I show love for Screw and let's.
