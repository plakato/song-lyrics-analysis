Rain Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Such a smile to make it all worth while.
But still can't compare to those eyes.
Don't say this is a lie.
This light could melt the Ice.
That hangs off my lashes; Breath froze in my chest.
Praying my heart can stop beating so fast.
Don't say this is a lie.
Please tell me it's a lie.

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
I can break this cage.
I can omit, I can forget.
Every sweet embrace.
I will rip through, every sin to, get what's in you.
Superficial... I won't take; I'll wait till you sleep.

Breathe a little deeper and calm yourself....
This kind of thinking's not good for our health....
But I'll wait... Just wait....

Such a smile to make it all worth while.
But still can't compare to those eyes.
Don't say this is a lie.
This light could melt the Ice.
That hangs off my lashes; Breath froze in my chest.
Praying my heart can stop beating so fast.
Don't say this is a lie.
Please tell me it's a lie.

Never said a word, never understood, just how much I cared.
I can be erased, fingers laced, now gone from your hair.
I'd never ask for your sorrows or tissues.
I've accepted that I can't be with you.
I'll be okay.

No more dreaming, no, no more dreaming.
I can't believe what I've seen through my soul.
She keeps leaving and I'm sick of being alone.
I was a fool to think I'd have her at all.

We keep bleeding, I just keep bleeding.
None of our pleading can do any good....
Fickle...fickle and fleeting.
But I swear on everything I love, I'll capture this dove....

Capture Her....
If I can't have her, no one will.

Breathe a little deeper and calm yourself....
This kind of thinking's not good for our health....
But I'll wait... Just wait....

Such a smile to make it all worth while.
But still can't compare to those eyes.
Don't say this is a lie.
This light could melt the Ice.
That hangs off my lashes; Breath froze in my chest.
Praying my heart can stop beating so fast.
Don't say this is a lie.
Please tell me it's a lie.

//Traitor, Traitor, Traitor, Traitor.
...Are you still breathing?
//I was there, there, there, there.
...You didn't see me.
I still love you....
