Gig Life Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

You ran away.
You were afraid to make mistakes.
But that's the biggest one you made.
And it's unfortunate.
You hit the road.
Yeah, you finally left your home.
Somewhere to the West, I suppose.
And I feel bad for you.

â€˜Cause you'll be home soon but I won't wait for you.
This is gig life.

I stared out at a lake off the highway in the West Virginia mid-day and it was.
perfect.
Not sure where I'll be next, maybe Texas or Athens, OH, Philadelphia, PA.
Now it's just Rival Schools and mewithoutYou on our car rides.

You'll be home soon but I won't wait for you.
This is gig life.
