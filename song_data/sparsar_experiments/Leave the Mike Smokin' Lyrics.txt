Leave the Mike Smokin' Lyrics
by Wreckx-N-Effect.

Aqil A-Plus Davidson 
Tonka toy rappers, I'm rippin' 
Mainly because they be slippin' 
In, the puddles of Aqil and the Redhead Kingpin 
S-C-double-O-P Rock 
Brothers, be all on the jock. See 
What I mean. Is the clock me 
Or cock block me 
They, try to stop the 
Toot, not Tootie 
I'm sure enough, not booty 
Or sex and I don't really care 
Whose up next after Wrecks. 
Stets is the runner up 
And by the way, the new kid yo he sucks 
And. When I'm rappin' 
Sonny you're sorta trapped in a room full of horror, 
But ain't, nothin', happenin', 
T-C-E-F-F-E-N-S-K-C-E-R-W, 
If you're, not sure, then what are you 
Stupid or something It spells Wrecks N Effect, 
Write it out and switch it around and see what you get 
 
Yo. 
Brothers. Hang around clockin' my rhymes to see the lyrics 
In the same spot for days and yo. So here is 
A little sample of something for your and your crew. 
And after the sixteenth bar I'll be through 
I know you can't cope if Aqil keeps on loopin' 
Rhymes. I rhyme and if you do then sonny you've been 
Places, where no other man has heard'em before 
And. You can come back any day if you want more 
It doesn't really matter, but I don't rhyme for free 
The fee that you pay is for me 
And W-N-E, which I'm a part of 
I'm right at the heart of 
Rappin' skills. I use to build my stardom 
Rappers, can't tolerate me. 
I'M drivin''em, bombin''em, great 
You, couldn't wait to bite 
So you bit and you ate 
More than you can chew. 
Now you're, chokin', 
But, I'mma, step off 
And leave you with the mike smokin' 
 
Aqil's in effect 
And. The A ain't for apt, 
When you've rocked with the rest 
So long that I've trapped you 
You, can't turn it down. 
Your brain cells are jumpin' 
From. The lyrics that I kick 
And the beat the DJs are thumpin' 
Now ain't that somethin' 
Rappers pull a stunt when 
I say rhymes that are crazy. Pumpin' 
Slammin', clashin' 
I was out when Flash was in 
There's no way. You could talk more than Sebastian 
Friday night sex. 
Little pecks, scratches on your back 
While you're puttin', those Wrecks-N-Effect, 
B-Doggs and Markie Mark are my DJs 
Rippin' up singles 
And mixin' on the long plays 
2-2-5 St. Nick Apartment. 
I got you thinkin' 
Until your eyes swell and start blinkin'. 
But right now follow our slogan. 
 
Yeah, then I leave the mike smokin'
