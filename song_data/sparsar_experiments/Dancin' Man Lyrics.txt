Dancin' Man Lyrics
by Q.

Hey buddy, you ain't gon na make that chic
Just sitting and running your mouth
 Got ta get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, get the guitar. Reeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
Put down that drink and do it right, quick
Cause, dancing's! What it's all about
 Got ta get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, get the guitar. Reeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
Say, don't you know, I've got that news
Straight from the horse's mouth
You know. They'Re doing this thing up. North
But it's started way down. South
Hey dancin' man 
You, can stop and go find all that you want
But you got ta get out of your seat. Yeah yeah yeah
 Got ta, get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, get the guitar. Reeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
All she wants is a dancin'. Man
He knows how to move them. Feet
 Got ta, get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, get the guitar. Reeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
How. Can you sit still when music's hot 
You got ta come up and move
Swear, sometimes you're all nailed down
When? You can't feel that groove
Hey dancin' man, 
 Got ta, get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, get the guitar reeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
All she wants is a dancin' man
All. She needs is a dancin' man
All. She wants is a dancin' man
