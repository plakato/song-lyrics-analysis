Play the Victim Lyrics
by The World Alive.


You're the one who always falls apart.
The one who plays the victim.
Working on your latest tragedy.
When you should want to fix it.
You don't understand and.
You won't listen!

Why do we do what we do?
We do it to ourselves!

When, when will it end?
We do it to ourselves!

I'm not the one you should be worried about.
You're so lost, you're so lost.
Why does nothing seems to get through you?
These are your problems, there's nothing I can do!

You don't understand it.
You won't LISTEN.

Why do we do what we do?
We do it to ourselves!

When, when will it end?
We do it to ourselves!

Knowing your tears are make believe.
Snowflakes in the summer.
It just doesn't add up, it just doesn't add up.
Like icicles in spring.

WAKE UP! WAKE UP!
AND SEE THE TRUTH!
I'M NOT LIKE YOU!

Why do we do what we do?
We do it to our....
Why do we do what we do?
We do it to ourselves!
WE DO IT TO OUR....
