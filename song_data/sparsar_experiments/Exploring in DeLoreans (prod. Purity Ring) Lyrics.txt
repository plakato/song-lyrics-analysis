Exploring in DeLoreans (prod. Purity Ring) Lyrics
by Wonder Bred.


I gotta make sure me and my brothers are livin'.
So I gotta travel back in time like I was trippin'.

Drive and spin tires, travel in the timer.
As I spin fire, give you what is desired.

I'm like Marty McFly I go out and I'm back.
To the Future, Time Looper, inside of my rap.

Start at the final part and I draw it around.
Like Doc getting automatically shot to the ground.

I start my day with bananas, peel is the fuel.
I'm jammin' like Marty with his guitar, feeling cool.
My parents are also always talking of school.
But I ride on a board and I walk like a fool.

I laugh at Cadillac's driven by pricks.
Like the truck that dumped, yo, I hit em with shit.

Nevermind time, I'm Doc on a Clock Tower.
Drive to rewind, clocks tick tock on the hour.
I'm rapping so fast that I vanish in fire.
I'm back to the past after trashing my tires.

I've been watching your kindness keep.
A lonely company.
Look at the fire and think of me.

One set of keys, 88 miles an hour.

The Flux Capacitor.
Looks Triangular.
Time Travel Masterer.
Opposite of Amateur.

Time is tangible and.
The date is manageable.

Open the letter, Dude.
On the day that I'm telling you to!

Don't talk about the Future! You shoulda known best.
But Doc, you've got to rock a bulletproof vest!

Going to a dance and your face gets slammed.
Marty McFly, this time, you've got one chance.
Gotta make sure your dad makes his advance.
You fade to a trance, gotta jam for the fans.

Like Michael J, I'm pulsating.
My pen has been shaking.
At thoughts of a DeLorean in History Making.
I could've gone and dropped lots of bets to get bacon.
But I could stop the Holocaust in the time this has taken.

Well I could've gone and dropped lots of bets to get bacon.
But I could stop the Holocaust, I could stop the Holocaust in the time this.
has taken.
