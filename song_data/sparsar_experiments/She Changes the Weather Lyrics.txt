She Changes the Weather Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Seen it all but I've seen nothing yet.
Cause I forget.
Do I know or do I think I know?
It's so weird, it's so clear.

She takes my time and I don't mind.
She makes me feel like, like I can see for miles.
She changes the weather in my world.
Seems like it's never getting cold.

It's okay, it's not obvious.
Cause what you say will make my day.
Rid of consequence.
It's so real, but it's so clear.

She takes my time and I don't mind.
She makes me feel like, like I can see for miles.
She changes the weather in my world.
Seems like we're never getting old.
