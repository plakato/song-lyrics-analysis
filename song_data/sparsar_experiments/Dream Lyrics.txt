Dream Lyrics
by Xhoshi Cami.

Drunk as fuck.
One sock pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves.
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars.
Got two fucking hydroxycuts and four oxy's stuck in my esophagus.
These three lesbian little stocky sluts.
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks.
Started screamin' Serves you right you cocky fuck!
That's what you get for mockin' us Ain't as cool as you thought you was..
How the fuck he got an Oscar?
Passed out in his red Mazda.
With his fucking head in his pasta.
In the parking lot of k-mart plaza.
Across from the red lobster.
Looking like the Lochness monster.
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster.
Looked like a bumpster yahahahahaha.
