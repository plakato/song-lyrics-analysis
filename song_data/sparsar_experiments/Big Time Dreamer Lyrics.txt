Big Time Dreamer Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


You may not know it now.
But you and I were meant to be.
Why I are you so afraid.
Of a little destiny.
If I had to wait.
To turn your heart around.
Patience is a virtue.
That's been handed down.

I'm the son of a big time dreamer.
That's where I get my dreamin' from.
Daddy was a firm believer in the power of love.
You say I'm crazy to fall for you.

That's what my mama told my daddy too.
I'm the son of a big time dreamer.
Baby make my dreams come true.
I guess it's in my bones.
I guess it's in my blood.
I'm a romantic fool.
Like my father's father was.
Remember back in school.
We learned what Einstein said.
It's all relative.

The way I feel for you it isn't hard to see.
The apple doesn't fall far from the family tree.
