Yo, I'm from a hellhole where male role models live in bottles, 
And a nigga. First love is a drug 
We, all fascinated by thug activity: street life, liberty, 
Whole ghetto remedy, toss'em, a slug 
It's, the untameable nonflammable 
Unrestrainable, nonchangeable, M.O.P. 
From, the dark side. My family provide knowledge, 
To determine if niggas like you can live or die on the street 
 
Lil' Fame 
This is recreational wreck to keep y'all illin 
Sound off pump rounds off rock, like Bob Dylan would 
One-million and one guns one-million and one sons. 
Cap pealin put two in your lungs BLUM BLUM 
It's, the world's most amaaazing 
Blazing, DAMN DAMN DAMN 
Critically acclaimed criminals to blame 
Put'em in critical condition: fuckin with Lil' Fame, 
 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH, { Holdin it down } 
If you wan na be hard rocks; c'mon, LET IT BANG 
 { Holdin it down } 
If, it's hits. You want hit'em
