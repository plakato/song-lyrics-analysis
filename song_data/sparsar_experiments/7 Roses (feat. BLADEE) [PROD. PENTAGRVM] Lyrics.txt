7 Roses (feat. BLADEE) [PROD. PENTAGRVM] Lyrics
by Black Kray.


Shawty wanna drive my whip.
Nascar sit on 26.
Shawty she like 26.
And I swear I seen her lie.
While my family selling white.
Sometimes I just wanna cry.
Shawty wanna drive my whip.
Nascar sit on 26.
Shawty she like 26.
And I swear I seen her lie.
While my family selling white.
Sometimes I just wanna cry.
Shawty wanna drive my whip.
Nascar sit on 26.
Shawty she like 26.
And I swear I seen her lie.
While my family selling white.
Sometimes I just wanna cry.

And Im riding by my lone.
Nascar sitting on that chrome.
And im smoking on that strong.
Sometimes I just wanna cry.
While my family selling white.
All they wanna do is shine.
All I wanna do is shine.
7 Prayers from my heart.
7 roses from my heart.
Swear I love you from the start.
Hope we make it to the end.
With lil candy coated benz.

Shawty wanna drive my whip.
Nascar sit on 26.
Shawty she like 26.
And I swear I seen her lie.
While my family selling white.
Sometimes I just wanna cry.
Shawty wanna drive my whip.
Nascar sit on 26.
Shawty she like 26.
And I swear I seen her lie.
While my family selling white.
Sometimes I just wanna cry.

Pray to god it gets better.
I love my family for ever.
Keep waiting it will never come.
I see diamonds in my mirror.
Skies getting clearer.
I want you to have my heart.
Is it enough to know, love tonight.
10k for my arms to shine.
Cellphone or some astrolove, lost tonight.
I think I can be the one.

Shawty wanna drive my whip.
Nascar sit on 26.
Shawty she like 26.
And I swear I seen her lie.
While my family selling white.
Sometimes I just wanna cry.
Shawty wanna drive my whip.
Nascar sit on 26.
Shawty she like 26.
And I swear I seen her lie.
While my family selling white.
Sometimes I just wanna cry.
