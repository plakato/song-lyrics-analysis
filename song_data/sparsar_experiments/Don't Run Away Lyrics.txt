Don't Run Away Lyrics
by Tyler James Williams.

Tyler James Williams.
Her beauty's crazy.
I watch her from the crowd.
Her voice is so amazing.
She make her momma proud.
I tried to send her flowers.
But she has no address.
Her home is in my heart.
It's like she never left.

This is more than a crush.
More than a like, like.
More than a love.
Baby I'mma make you mine.
And I ain't giving up.
X2.

Don't run away.
Don't run away from the truth.
Cause I'm not giving up on you.
X2.

Shawty you got fire.
But I'm preaching to the choir.
I know you know.
The whole world is watching you, so.

Don't run away.
Don't run away from the truth.
Cause I'm not giving up on you.

Tyler James Williams.
Uh, they say true love is blind.
That real romance is timeless.
You're like my favorite movie.
Play it and rewind it.
Cuz baby you're the finest.
Your love I'm gonna find it.
And when I do, I'll run away with you.
Somewhere where they can't find us.

Tyler James Williams.
Normally I couldn't turn your head.
That's why I had to write this instead.
Let's be friends, start out slow.
Get to know you beyond your glow.
You're more than meets the eye.
Girl you pterodactyl fly.
Way back when you knew my name.
Now the truth is what is what I claim.
