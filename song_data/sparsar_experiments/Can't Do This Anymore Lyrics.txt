Can't Do This Anymore Lyrics
by Unique B..


I can't take it, so I won't do it no more.
It ain't all that cool and I'm still making no dough.
My equipment ain't cheap. It ain't crap with my brother.
I'm doing this alone. I don't need any other.

And to my peoples, it may be a bit embarrassing.
Outside I'm outcasted, but inside, I'm very in.
I vary within my style. Smell hatred within the mile.
This talent stacked back on the market isle.

I'm not a user, just an active abuser.
Of the terms stupid, overrated, and loser.
And I'm neither. I'm actually the opposite.
And underrated winner with some knowledge of a college kid.

And look what college did? I meant middle school.
Sorry mama for the changes they wasn't cool.
Everybody thinks I follow the rules or don't.
And for that I won't.

Can you stay up for the weekend.
And play golf and looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for?
I've just been replaced, with millions ago.
Can you dream yourself to mountains?
I can feel pain and swallow fear.
Can you stay up for the weekend or next year?

What am I saying? That would be stupid.
See I said it again! I'm such a fucking in loser.
My shit is overrated. Actually I hate it.
I understand these haters so I'mma see you later.

What am I sayin? I'm too cool and too schooled.
Need to get up on my feet and stop acting like a fool.
I'm rapping not actin cool. I'm not old, and not actin new.
I'm straight I know the rules. They hate, they look like fools.

My career ain't a fraction through.
I'll die, but first I'll do.
I'll cry, but only for you.
And if you knew, it would be cool, but it ain't.

I'm gotta tell you now or we'll never be the fate.
I lie about my feelings. That's the only time I'm fake.
Amazingly lazy never been on a date.
But I think we can change.
