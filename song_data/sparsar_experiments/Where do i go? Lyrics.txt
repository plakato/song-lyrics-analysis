Where do i go? Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


Rain drops on my window where I used to go.
I touch all the pieces I used to know.

Rushing through my head and I wish that I were dead.
I say, Where do I go again? Where do I go again?
I can never find, I know I am never right.
I say, Where do I go again? Where do I again?

All of this weakness, it drives me mad.
And all of the streets end when they don't begin.
I lose so many times, I stop and I can't go.
I pray that I might find a place, a place to call my home.

Count back to zero and they'll never know.
All of the pieces will never show.
