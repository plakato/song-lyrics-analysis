Gimme Three Steps Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

With a gun in his hand.
And this might be all for you.
Gimme three steps.
Well he turned and screamed at Linda Lu.
I was cutting the rug.
With the hair colored yellow.
He said, Hey there fellow.
I was scared and fearing for my life.
Gimme three steps mister.
As the water fell on the floor.
Down at a place called The Jug.
And you'll never see me no more.
I said, Wait a minute, mister.
And I'm telling you son.
Gimme three steps mister.
Gimme three steps towards the door?
And I began to pray.
Because that's my woman there.
I didn't even kiss her.
Gimme three steps.
And I'm a man who cares.
But I wish you'd let me.
Well, it ain't no fun.
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree.

Ask one favor from you.
Staring straight down a forty-four.
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Big and bad, Lord.

And that's the break I was looking for.
When in walked a man.
Won't you give me three steps.
Gimme three steps mister.

And I know you don't owe me.
And you'll never see me no more.
And he was looking for you know who.
Won't you give me three steps.
Well the crowd cleared away.
Because he was lean, mean.

Don't want no trouble with you.
Gimme three steps mister.
What you trying to prove?
And you could hear me screaming a mile away.
Pointing that gun at me.
With a girl named Linda Lu.
As I was headed out towards the door.
