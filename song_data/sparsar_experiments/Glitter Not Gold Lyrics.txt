Glitter Not Gold Lyrics
by Ruse.

You're electric with your sunken eyes.
It's takes you one hit to put you in the sky.
And all you have is your innocence.
And all you need is a ghost.
You know and I know.
If you go then I go where you go.
You set my skull on fire.
It's so tragic every time you try.
So pathetic with your cocaine smile.
And all you have is your innocence.
And all you need is the most.
You know and I know.
If you go then I go where you go.
You set my skull on fire.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
It's glitter it's not gold.
But that's not what you were told.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
It's glitter it's not gold, but that's not what you were.
You know and I know.
If you go then I go where you go.
You set my skull on fire.
