Let's Dance Lyrics
by Sweet Tee.


As the turntables turn, the wheels burn.
Pay attention, there's a lesson to learn.
I'm about to get hype, so take a chance.
What I want you to do now, is dance.

Let's dance.

Put the needle to my record, step back, and watch it go.
You wanna hear if it's good? Huh, now you know.
I want you to observe.
The way I say every noun, every verb.
I'm superb, word to Hurb.
Bustin a rap while your feet tap.
On time with my rhymes while my DJ rocks the scratch.
I'm in the midst of a rappin blizz'.
And you ain't never heard a girl rock the mic like this.
Out of those seats, yo bee, you gotta dance for me.
Scream and yell, cause the record's gonna sell, you see.
So tell a friend, and a friend how hype it is.
Never sour, gonna tell you how ripe it is.
Get with the go, with the flow, with the action.
Time after time I'ma come back maxin'.
So just take this chance to get some ants in your pants.
Under this circumstance, all you gotta do is dance.

Dance.
I know you got the feeling.
Let's dance.
Come on and get down.

Sittin' in my room with a pen and a pad.
Wouldn't say I was bored, well, just a tad.
I wrote this rhyme to make you dance.
Throw your hands up high and shake those pants.
The needle won't jump, the system pumps.
Make the baddest in the field feel like suckers and chumps.
Never call my bluff, don't sleep, I get rough.
You can tell I'm hard as hell with a feminine touch.
Spreadin like a vine, and I'ma grow on, and flow on.
And so on, and so on, and so on.
Stompin' the world with marvellous hit after hit.
Designed so you can dance to it.
So get jumpin and pumpin, cause it's time to rejoice.
Sweet Tee's on the mic, can't you tell by the sound of my voice?
Lettin you know one time in advance.
You gotta get on the dancefloor and dance.

Get up and dance, is what I intended.
If you're still in your seat, I'll be offended.
Here to set it off, so those who think I'm soft.
When I enter the room - break north.
Rampagin, upstagin when in rage.
I'm like a beast breakin out of his cage.
Cause it's time to rhyme, get mine, can't take a resign.
New jacks, hit the back of the line.
Now you knowm get up, dance, so my show.
Can flow, come on, you know, let's go.
Dance in sweat, breakdown to the beat and let me.
Turn it out, so you can never forget me.
Sweet Tee at the t-o-p.
Most definitely, gettin paid, g after g.
To enhance, party people, put you in a trance.
What I want you to do for me now, is dance.
