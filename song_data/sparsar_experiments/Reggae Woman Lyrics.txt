Reggae Woman Lyrics
by Xazz.


Oh, la la la lie.
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Reggae woman, why you making me so sad.
All I need is you to be here, and this life won't be so bad.
Reggae woman, why you bring me down with you.
Put aside your negative thoughts, and this life will start anew.

Sing, if you wanna sing.
Dance, if you wanna dance.
Live your life like you've got nothing else to do.
And this world is in your hands.

Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Reggae woman, what you doing with your life.
Come with me we'll be together, I won't cause you any strife.
Oh, reggae woman, why you making me so mad.
Come with me and we'll be happy, the best life you've ever had.

Sing, if you wanna sing.
Dance, if you wanna dance.
Live your life like you've got nothing else to do.
And this world is in your hands.

Instrumental.

Oh, la la la lie.
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Reggae woman, why you making me so sad.
All I need is you to be here, and this life won't be so bad.
Oh, reggae woman, why you making me so mad.
Come with me and we'll be happy, the best life you've ever had.

Sing, if you wanna sing.
Dance, if you wanna dance.
Live your life like you've got nothing else to do.
And this world is in your hands.
Oh, sing if you wanna sing.
Dance, if you wanna dance.
Live your life like you've got nothing else to do.
And this world is in your hands.
