Closer Lyrics
by Ty.

Closer.
Closer to my dreams.
It's coming over me.
I'm gettin' higher.
Closer to my dreams.
I'm getting higher and higher.
Feel it in my sleep.
Some times it feels like I'll never go pass here.
Some times it feels like I'm stuck forever and ever.
But, I'm going higher.
Closer to my dreams.
I'm goin' higher and higher.
I can almost reach.
Some times you just have to let it go.
Leaving all my fears to burn down.
Push them all away so I can move on.
Closer to my dreams.
Feel it all over my being.
Close your eyes and see what you believe.
I'm happy as long as we're apart.
Then I'm moving on to my dreams.
I'll be moving higher.
Closer to my dreams.
And higher and higher, higher.
Feel it in my being.
I know that I could not go alone.
I'm moving higher , oh....
I'm going higher and higher and higher.
Closer to my dreams.
I'm moving upward and onward and beyond all I can see.

Feels so close it's like i can just reach.
I can feel my dreams.
I'm moving closer to my dreams.
I'm moving  higher and higher.

Moving higher, oh....
Some times it feels like you never gon'change.
But you never choose to walk away.
