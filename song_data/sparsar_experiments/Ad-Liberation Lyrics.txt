Ad-Liberation Lyrics
by Wonder Bred.

Young rap artist bred by wonder and fascination, beginning of songs on.
youtube: Ad-Liberation is about the constant trapping cycle of money and greed.
which overcomes desires and Wonder Bred's personal stance on the whole cheese.

Lyrics:.

Money seems so key for most these people to be happy.
But to me following my passion, it happens to be almost the last thing.
I don't wanna be a CEO sitting at a desk.
I might always golf or drive a Benz.
But is this really a life well spent?
Its the little things with people that complete me to the core.
I don't need TV's as decoys or disposable drugs to destroy Employ:.
This is the question.
My life isn't in a recession.
No advice, and no suggestions.
This is just me and my tribe call it questing.
I could be a billionaire with a B.
But to me I'll be an ILL-ionaire for free.
I don't need no thing fancy.
I'd rather relax.
Than race after racks.
I'm a rapper who has only one chance.
Spend less at a desk and more time inside a dance.
Get lost in lady lips like it's a trance.
I'd rather reap what I've sown with my own hands.
No yo I can't coax my soul.
Do my own most rather than go after gold.
Life as a doc seems like it would get old.
What happens after you die if your own soul inside has been sold?
Cars, clothes and mansions, can't have 'em when you're gone.
So like Robert Frost the path less traveled is that that I'm on.
I follow my dream.
Not career instant cheese.
The limit is the sky by B.I.G.
So Imma follow my inside until infinity.

I hope you're feeling me.
Cause Imma follow my inside until infinity.
And the sky- that is limiting.
Because that is infinity.

Wordsmith is me.
Wonder B-R-E-D.

I just write to describe.
The insides of my mind.
I wanna provide.
But by getting signed.
I cannot compromise.
There are times when I just want to be reckless.
You might not get it.
But I have got to express it - not suppress it.
I can't stand Concessions.
Never spent a session.
In a concession stand.
Nobody in my school can understand.
Much of the dance.
Of this man.
But see? I walk my own path by my lonely.
I need no one to know me.
To the T.
I would rather board with my little bro.
Than be bored on a little phone.
Get it yo? Don't forget it though.
I used to LEAN out windows at home and smoke weed.
No Codeine.
Chilling with the Homies.
To maintain totally and hopefully.
Tomorrow my talks go well.
I've got to tell.
All that's on my mind so my chest don't swell.
Please don't tell.
Me that my emotions are wrong.
Cause I've got a problem over Control and so on....
I won't jump to so long.
But for this to go on.
I just need you on.
The same page as me.
That don't mean agree.
But you best be emotionally.
Respecting me.

I want to be watching Cheech and Chong's Up In Smoke.
I'm a starving artist, so we all gon' go out for broke.

This is infinity.
I follow my inside unlimited-ly.
... Peace.
