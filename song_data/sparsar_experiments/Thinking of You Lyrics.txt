Thinking of You Lyrics
by UNK.


Whoahhh I, been  thinkin of you.
Wishin, that you could come back to me.

Unk - talking over Jazze Phizzle.
Ay, this one goes out to anybody who ever lost someone in they family.
This one goes out to everybody in the pen on lockdown.
We just lettin y'all know we thinkin about y'all man.
We missin y'all everyday.
So this song right here is to let e'rybody know.
We been missin y'all, we keepin y'all in our hearts man, f'real.
Everyday, come back.

Unk.
Since you been gone it's been some rainy dayz.
And I'ma spit it from the heart while I'm blowin haze.
With my Versace shades, tryin to hold the tears too.
Uncle Walt man the whole family missin you.
See cain't nobody hold it down like you do.
I'm gettin money, DJ Unk, your little nephew.
And Grandma Bell, how the hell you ain't see me fly.
It was your guidance that helped your baby get by.
I take one day at a time and watch my every self.
Uncle, brother, cousin Jerry and the hearts we kept.
Nobody knows when we gonna take our last breaths.
Hug your mother, hug your father, nigga hug yourself.
We kept it real in the field, what's up Dolla Bill.
I had a dream we was smokin kush up on the hill, with B.I.G.
You did it big for a country kid.
Long as I say you in my rhyme my peoples still lives.
And that's for real.

Unk.
I'm wishin everythang was all good.
I tell my grateful memory for my folks who left the hood.
Whether the pen or bein six feet underneath.
Put your lighters in the air if you feelin me.
And everythang'll be alright if you hold on.
Damn pop, if you coulda just held on.
I stay strong, hold my own on my two feet.
Positivity, that's what surrounds me.
And damn Biggie you done repped Brooklyn like nigga.
I never seened you like never saw Momma Tigger.
She mighta been Dane's girl but she was ours too.
Aaliyah yeah One in a Million and we missin you.
On 1's and 2's I been a fool, I put my pranks away.
Ain't been the same since they killed Jam Master Jay.
Big Pun, Big L, yeah Freaky Tah.
Camoflauge, Soulja Slim, my girl Left Eye, I wonder why.

Jazze Pha.
Sometimes I find it hard to make it through the night.
Missin my homie cause we was so tight.
Glad that I can say he was a part of my life.
Now everything gon' be alright.
Alright  alright  alright  alright.
Alright  alright , everything gon' be alright.

Jazze Pha.
Come on back now, well well well.
I been thinkin 'bout you-oooooooooh-oooooooooh-oooooh-oooooooooooh~!
