Raised to Pray Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Smoking Swishers like we just don't care.
Holding 99 cent lighters way up in the air.
Drowning fears with the King of Beers.
‘Til we wasn't scared to talk to the girl on the rusted out fender.

I remember stealing pallets just to build us a fire.
Out in a field full of whiskey, weeds, and wine.
Running on empty but I never got tired.
Of keeping Mama up all night and making Daddy want to kick my ass.

We were going nowhere fast.
Living for the moment not thinking ahead or looking back.
From the outside looking in we might have been a little rough around the edges.
But the devil couldn't catch us ‘cause, hey, at the end of the day.
We were raised to pray.

Sure owe a lot to that old King James.
Under the seat with my last name.
On the cover of it should have opened it more.
Instead of letting it slide around on the truck floor.

We were going nowhere fast.
Living for the moment not thinking ahead or looking back.
From the outside looking in we might have been a little rough around the edges.

But the devil couldn't catch us ‘cause, hey, at the end of the day.
We were raised to pray.

We were washed in the blood.
Covered in mud.
Holding onto anything that felt like love.
Come hell or high water we wouldn't let it go.

We were going nowhere fast.
Living for the moment not thinking ahead or looking back.
From the outside looking in we might have been a little rough around the edges.
But the devil couldn't catch us ‘cause, hey, at the end of the day.
We were raised to pray.
Yeah raised to pray.
At the end of the day.
We were raised to pray.
