Memories and Loneliness Lyrics
by Swing Dee Diablo.

Memories And Loneliness.

First Verse.

I nearly passed out when I got that beautiful phone call.
You wanted to see me so we had lunch at the mall.
It's been a year since I last saw you.
And I must say.
You haven't change.
You're beautiful still in every way.
I'll never forgive myself because you tried to love me.
You stayed faithful to me for years.
Like church on Sunday.
And all I did was mess around with any girl.
Who would mess around.
Leaving you alone and you still.
Held me down.
I don't think a day passes.
When I don't think about you.
I Pray to the lord.
Hoping he keep an eye on you.
And I must admit I wish that I could.
Just hold you in my arms.
Lift the veil over my heart.
Just to reveal the scars.
And i know you happy with him.
I know he treats you right.
But I can tell you miss me.
And the things we did at night.
Let's not make Love with our eyes.
Let's bring love back into our Lives.
Leave him and i'll do right by you.
Make you my Wife.

Second Verse.

I break my neck whenever I drive by where.
You used to live.
Memories and loneliness by now.
I'm used to it.
Each passing day your silhouette.
I try to forget but I'm getting sick.
I wish God would just give me back my Rib.
It's like the lord is playing funny games.
As soon as I get you out my brain.
There you are standing in a frame.
Looking beautiful like you're some type of artwork.
When I think of how I did you.
It makes my heart hurt.
Yeah I want you to know.
