Rolled Ova Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


Aaaah huh, right back up in ya.
Platinum Soul, bend over or get rolled over.

Noke D &amp;.
If you, ain't up on thangs.

And we, make beats that bang.

Now tell me what it do nigga, you got your ass on your shoulders.
Peeping like the rollers, you niggas can't hold us.
I told ya, y'all don't wanna see a real soldier.
Either roll with us, or you get rolled over.

D-Gotti.
Thoed in the game, I flow for the change.
It was just me shooting me in the foot, locked in chains.
Body rock, I thank around the block still paid.
But I'm focused, with a lil' mo' respect for the game.
Check game, my mama and them in the projects.
I gotta get her out, so getting paid's my only option.
God protect a nigga off his game, stay strong.
Tell myself only real thangs, smart change homes.
Running, from my blood to my bones.
Pines is on, won't put a nigga in a tombstone.
Wrong, to push them pies.
I'm not a role model, I ain't one of the good guys.
I'm Goody-Gotti, out the Wreckshop Fam.
Bout to be one of the greatest, swear I'm bout that Fam.
Leave it or scram, I'll hit you with the tool.
Off the most in the streets, know D-Gotti a fool.

Noke D &amp; Double D.

Double D.
Hold up wait, Mr. fly guy.
You ain't original why try, you pitiful.
It's gonna take a miracle, to get you to the pinnacle.
As long as you know, that we could never be identacle.
It's obvious, why niggas copy us.
But then they coming with the sloppiest, so now I gotta put a stop to this.
I'm dropping this.
To put these mad rappers, and beat jackers away.
I night I still pray, for the ones gone astray.
You niggas more drug than thugged, out occuring in your flow.
So I'm pulling the plug out, remembering the game keep me doing my thang.
And it's official, ain't nothing changed.
We ride, we stepping and repping the Southside.
No niggas from outside, just Double D and thr guys.
Keep my eyes on the prize, but I gotta remind ya.
When you fucking with the click, we gon come out and find ya.

Noke D &amp; Double D.

D-Reck.
On the mash, till the motherfucking cash come.
Fuck a major deal, a nigga had to kill the last one.
Power and greed, then pride times three.
So Dirty did it like the Dirty 3, hurry back to the streets.
Cause they know, how we do's it.
Southside music, so they can't groove with this Wreckshop movement.

Can't name a Houston rapper, that ain't stole at least one quote.
From Laffeyette, to the A-T-X.
From Dallas to New Orleans, we all in they deck.
I raised you boys, paved the way for you boys.
Don't check my coolness for no foolish, may Lil' J you boys.
We train blocks, and tie em in a knot.
We bring mo' heat to the streets, than a undercover cop.
We what you need, what these other cats can't see.
Can't be, so nigga just continue to floss me.

Noke D &amp; Double D.

Dirty $.
Yes sir we buy, my squad go hard.
Y'all don't want no problems, y'all don't even wanna start.
None of y'all got heart, no bite all bark.
Puddens get torn apart, big dogs run this yard.
Yeah uh-huh, we still leading the pack.
Hustlers love the way we made it, to the front from the back.
Going hard for them stacks, man the Shop been thoed.
The South still hold, if you hoes ain't know.
Who me shit, it's that Mr. Dirty $.
Original dickie boy, call me Jerry McGuire.
Higher, and strictly bout this feddy.
When it comes to fetching paper, my team stay ready.
Willing and able, first major independent label.
Go and get it, bring it back to the table.
Gorillas for scrilla, and savages about cabbage.
Cheetahs chasing cheddar, just not your average nigga.
And I'm married to this thang, the game.
But I garuntee before I go, y'all scream my name yeah.

Tyte Eyez.
You got your ass on your shoulders, I wonder why.
What you think you fly, motherfucker you think you better than I.
I think's not, and niggas ain't hot.
Bring the heat to em, accapellas from freestyle shit.
Just bring the beats to em, so many niggas walking with they nose up.
Is it cause we stealing bidness, or we done hit they hoes up.
Huh I really don't know, but I ain't trying to figure out.
Man my hustle ain't your hustle, cause I took a different route.
Buddy but anyway, why you all up in my mix.
That's why flies don't come around you, cause they know that you ain't shit.
Bitch, you run with to ticks and fleas and roaches.
So uh, get off my dick soon as you breathe you choking.
Bitch, you on my phone you know you wrong.
Just admit it, ain't nothing in the city seeing or hearing my committy.
So deal with it, or you getting rolled over.
Mr. Tyte E-Z, signing out like a soldier.
