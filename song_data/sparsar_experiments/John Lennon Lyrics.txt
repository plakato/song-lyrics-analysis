John Lennon Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


They say that its a cold world we're living in.
I wouldn't know been in my own world since I can't remember when.
Remember when there's no answer let it be don't think of giving in.
Get back up then begin again.
In the beginning when we were just children.
Our wildest dreams seemed limitless and imminent.
Raised by good men and good women then.
Grow up to recognize we're not so innocent.
Not so infinite and limited a little bit.
A middle finger to the stresses and the little ****.
Our only hopes to make the most while in the thick of it.
This is our predicament no time to be inhibited.

We all shine on.
Like the moon and the stars and the sun.
We all shine on.
Like the moon the stars the sun.
We all shine on.
Like the moon and the stars and the sun.
We all shine on.
Like the moon the stars and John Lennon.

It's quarter past 7.
Cold world, wide awake, sleep'll never get em.
When it's another day another dead-end.
I'm digging in the crate to make a diamond from a lemon.

Young at heart, dishing up.
that life spiel.
I've got a big dream, big will.
Wheels running in my head that don't sit still.
Still, there's room for development.
Nobody's talking, we're like a room full of elephants.
Piling up, up, up, ladies and gentlemen.
The closets too full we've got to move out the skeletons.
Good luck and, keep on trucking.
Songs not right, keep on plucking.
We buckle down, fuck around get nothing.
Believe me, when thing's get tough then.
We all shine on.
