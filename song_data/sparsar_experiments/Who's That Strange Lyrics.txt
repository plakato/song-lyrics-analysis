Who's That Strange Lyrics
by Unonimus.


Who's that in the back of the classroom.
With a patch on his back pack and a match sticking out through it?
Hand raised, asks for a pass to go to the bathroom.
And staggers outside the class just laughing while doing it.
Tick tock, that's the sound of the big box.
That the janitor found secured with a trick lock.
So then he thought he'd heard, with a big rock.
He could jam it, then it was sure to be switched off.
A black Glock in the hands of a mad boy.
That's wielding bad toys, gas, and a match box.
Hater of the bullies, savior of the bullied.
Leader of the small, and a stranger to the goodies.
Maybe he is a rookie.
But in his mind he's doing a favor for the wussies.

It didn't work, it's still ticking down.
If the bomb doesn't kill him then his guilt will for now.
A sad man who lived with a trashcan.
Just ended his life with his head in a trash bag.
He won't miss, the gun's at the nose tip.
He stared in the eye of a bully froze stiff.
He pulled the trigger and didn't hear one blam.
Again and again until he realized the gun's jammed.
Out came the matches but they were covered in water.
And when the gun should have went off it didn't even bother. Or maybe he's a.
wuss after all.
