Daddy Rich in the Land of 1210 Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

Who'S car is that 
Hey rock that shit homey 
Yeah man - that's Daddy's car man, Daddy, Rich 
You, never watch him on TV, 
, 
What's, yo', name, 
, {, Daddy, Rich cuts, up'Daddy Rich' }, I'm back 
What's, yo' name. 
Back is the incredible Chuck D {'Daddy Rich' } 
I'm back 
Back is the incredible Chuck D {'Daddy Rich' } 
He-re, we go.. Slick, Rick, 
 
Serch. Let me kick to you a fable bout, my DJ Daddy, Rich 
Nice, Born in Jamaica, but had to make a switch 
Serch, So he packed up his 12's and he headed'cross the sea 
Nice Found a new rest on the road of Beverly 
Serch. That'S Brooklyn, 
Nice Beatdowns. 40 dogs 
Serch And the Brooklyn-Queens 
 
MC, Serch, 
Cool, Daddy Rich, is on the 1210 mix. 
Scratch needs a itch like a needle. Does a stitch 
 
Pete Nice 
I switch up. He flips up the wax with a mixer 
Bookmakers step to the Father, he's a fixer 
 
MC Serch 
Cool to the cut shakin butts off the ledges 
Came a longer way than Benson and Hedges, 
 
Pete Nice 
The measures and levels of rhythm and scratch peaks 
Speaks. With fingers, the master of Technics 
 
MC Serch 

Displayin the ills that build on the one and two 
 
 {'Check out the Master' } {'Daddy Rich' } 
 {'Check out the Master' } 
 {'Check out the Master' } {'Daddy Rich' } .

 {'Check out the Master' } 
 {'Check out the Master' } {'Daddy Rich' } 
 {'Check out the Master as he cuts these Jams' Run-D.M.C. }

Nice, DJ D.R 
Serch. We are collectin 
Nice, the papes 
Serch of the drapes 
Nice of the cuts he's selectin 
Serch Yo Pete. You got a question 
Nice Hmmmm yeah. I got one 
Can. Anyone ever serve the Rich 
Serch Hmmmm, no, not one 
Nice To spin off spin, the twelve inches 
Serch. It'S a brawl that'll call both teams off the benches 
Nice Wenches that backed up beggin for the number 
Serch, Those Brooklyn-Queens better, get the Liquid Plumbr 
Nice Like lumberjacks swingin, an axe, 
Serch Flexin, the fader, with the stomach in your back 
Nice Set tracks aside for the Performer 

, {, Daddy Rich, continues to flex skills. } 
 
Nice, True form be givin. 
Serch Yo drive is drivin. 
Nice Got the jizz on your lip 
Serch Aiyyo. How you livin 

Serch. Can anyone serve the Richie Rich 
3rd? I DO N'T THINK SO.

MC, Serch 
Aiyyo. Can anybody touch you DJ Richie, Rich

Try to serve you 
 {'I, don't think so', LL, Cool J, } 
Try to duplicate you,

Yeah! That'S what I thought too 
We out.. peace..
