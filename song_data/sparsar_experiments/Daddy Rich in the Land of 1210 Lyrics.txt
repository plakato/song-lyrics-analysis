Daddy Rich in the Land of 1210 Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

Who's car is that?
Hey rock that shit homey.
Yeah man that's Daddy's car, man Daddy Rich.
You never watch him on TV?

What's yo' name?
{Daddy Rich cuts up 'Daddy Rich'} I'm back!
What's yo' name?
Back is the incredible - Chuck D {'Daddy Rich'}.
I'm back!
Back is the incredible - Chuck D {'Daddy Rich'}.
He-re we go.. - Slick Rick.

Serch Let me kick to you a fable bout my DJ Daddy Rich.
Nice Born in Jamaica but had to make a switch.
Serch So he packed up his 12's and he headed 'cross the sea.
Nice Found a new rest on the road of Beverly.
Serch That's Brooklyn.
Nice Beatdowns, 40 dogs.
Serch And the Brooklyn-Queens.

MC Serch.
Cool Daddy Rich is on the 1210 mix.
Scratch needs a itch like a needle does a stitch.

Pete Nice.
I switch up he flips up the wax with a mixer.
Bookmakers step to the Father he's a fixer.

MC Serch.
Cool to the cut, shakin butts off the ledges.
Came a longer way than Benson and Hedges.

Pete Nice.
The measures and levels of rhythm and scratch peaks.
Speaks with fingers, the master of Technics.

MC Serch.

Displayin the ills that build on the one and two.

{'Check out the Master'} {'Daddy Rich'}.
{'Check out the Master'}.
{'Check out the Master'} {'Daddy Rich'}.
...
{'Check out the Master'}.
{'Check out the Master'} {'Daddy Rich'}.
{'Check out the Master as he cuts these Jams' - Run-D.M.C.}.

{Daddy Rich continues to flex skills}.

Nice DJ D.R.
Serch We are collectin.
Nice the papes.
Serch of the drapes.
Nice of the cuts he's selectin.
Serch Yo Pete you got a question?
Nice Hmmmm, yeah I got one.
Can anyone ever serve the Rich?
Serch Hmmmm, no not one.
Nice To spin off, spin the twelve inches.
Serch It's a brawl that'll call both teams off the benches.
Nice Wenches that backed up, beggin for the number.
Serch Those Brooklyn-Queens better get the Liquid Plumbr.
Nice Like lumberjacks, swingin an axe.
Serch Flexin the fader with the stomach in your back.
Nice Set tracks aside for the performer.

{Daddy Rich continues to flex skills}.

Nice True form be givin.
Serch Yo, drive is drivin.
Nice Got the jizz on your lip.
Serch Aiyyo, how you livin?!

Serch Can anyone serve the Richie Rich?
3rd I DON'T THINK SO.

{'That's my man throwin down'}.
{'That's my man throwin down'}.
{'That's my man throwin down'}.
{'That's my man throwin down'}.

MC Serch.
Aiyyo, can anybody touch you DJ Richie Rich?
{'I don't think so' - LL Cool J}.
Try to serve you?
{'I don't think so' - LL Cool J}.
Try to duplicate you?
{'I don't think so' - LL Cool J}.
Can anybody touch 3rd Bass?
{'I don't think so' - LL Cool J}.
Yeah that's what I thought too.
We out.. peace...
