Bloody Island Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Blood curdling tale.
Mysterious island part of all yarn.
Thunder and gale.
Are leading you straight into its arms.

Island, a beautiful deadly pearl in the sea.
Siren, a dreadful goddess waiting for thee.

Turn your back on Bloody Island.
Stay away from the sorrow and pain.
Its deadly poison's writing your name.
Turn your back on Bloody Island.
Where hell and all evil will reign.
Its fatal malice leaves you insane - oh, Bloody Island.

Silver and diamonds.
Greed takes you straight by the heart.
Call of the Siren.
Its temptation tears you apart.

Island, a beautiful deadly pearl in the sea.
Siren, a dreadful goddess waiting for thee.

Turn your back on Bloody Island.
Stay away from the sorrow and pain.
Its deadly poison's writing your name.
Turn your back on Bloody Island.
Where hell and all evil will reign.
Its fatal malice leaves you insane - oh, Bloody Island.

Marvelous treasures.
Made-up stories creating its slave.
Loosing all measure.
Too many men still find their grave.

Island, a beautiful deadly pearl in the sea.
Siren, a dreadful goddess waiting for thee.

Turn your back on Bloody Island.
Stay away from the sorrow and pain.
Its deadly poison's writing your name.
Turn your back on Bloody Island.
Where hell and all evil will reign.
Its fatal malice leaves you insane - oh, Bloody Island.

Turn your back on Bloody Island.
Stay away from the sorrow and pain.
Its deadly poison's writing your name.
Turn your back on Bloody Island.
Where hell and all evil will reign.
Its fatal malice leaves you insane - oh, Bloody Island.

Bloody Island....
