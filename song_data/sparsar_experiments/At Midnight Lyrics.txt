At Midnight Lyrics
by Sweet.

Uh, uh, uh.
Let me tell you 'bout my girl.
Guaranteed to make your hair curl.
Doing things that only she can do.

Uh, uh, uh.
She made the world a stage.
Taking care of public image.
Shes looking good, but then she always does.

Here's what she wants to do.
At midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna love you.
Oh, at midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight.

Uh, uh, uh.
Monies everything to her.
Gonna get her diamond and furs.
But there's one thing money just can't buy.

Uh, uh, uh.
Love waits for the witchin' hour.
Sell your soul for the taste of power.
Still I love you, but then I always will.

Here's what she wants to do.
At midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna love you.
Oh, at midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight.

When daylight comes to you.
You hide from the world outside.
Lover of the darkest night.
Midnight's the time to get high.

At midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna love you.
Oh, at midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight.

At midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna love you.
Oh, at midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight.

At midnight.
Oh, I'm gonna love you.
Oh, at midnight, oh.
