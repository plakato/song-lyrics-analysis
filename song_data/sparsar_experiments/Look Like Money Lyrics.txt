Look Like Money Lyrics
by Yung Ralph.


Cause I look like money.
Smell like money.
Talk like money even walk.
like money.
Everywhere I go and everyway I be.
I don't even talk they still know it's me.
Cause I look like money.
Smell like money.
Talk like money even walk like money.
I pull up at tha club.
Man ima stunna.
Fresh outfit with my Dolce Gabbanas.
Cause I look like money.
Smell like money.
Talk like money even walk like money.

Man my wet paint leave a stain in tha streets.
Give me 16 bars I leave a stain on tha beat.
My pockets swoll up they need slim fast.
Got weight Neva been to a gym class.
But I walk around with pounds in a gym bag.
One call I can get rid of them real fast.
Man I came up quick in tha trap.
Got a whole lotta money thanks to all them caps.
Now look at my ride u can tells thats money.
And I look walk talk even smell like money.
I stay down.
Make quick flips.
No gas when I talk about quick trips.
If ya talkin dollars.
Then im down with it.
Like Lo, let's get get get it.
If I get a ticket it's all on me.
Cleveland Ave, Jonesboro.
hoes on 3.

Everywhere I go and everyway I be.
I don't even talk they still know it's me.
Cause I look like money.
Smell like money.
Talk like money even walk like money.
I pull up at tha club.
Man ima stunna.
Fresh outfit with my dol's and gabbana.
Cause I look like money.
Smell like money.
Talk like money even walk like money.

A hater shoe to small for my feet.
They can't piss what I drank they can't shit what I eat.
With no deals still known in tha streets'.
Wet paint ride rims way older then me.
This for them niggas that be hatin on me.
Walkin round holdin nuts conversation on me.
About a bitch you can have that ish.
Treat her like school give a early dismissal.
Big bank no 1's and a pistol.
Smoke thrax roll it up in king size swishas.
Check my swag I got flavor.
Call me notebook cause I got that paper.

Everywhere I go and everyway I be.
I don't even talk they still know it's me.
Cause I look like money.
Smell like money.
Talk like money even walk like money.
I pull up at tha club.
Man ima stunna.
Fresh outfit with my dol's and gabbana.
Cause I look like money.
Smell like money.
Talk like money even walk like money.

Like money.
Like money.
Like money.
Cause I look like money.
Like money.
Like money.
Like money.
Cause I look like money.
