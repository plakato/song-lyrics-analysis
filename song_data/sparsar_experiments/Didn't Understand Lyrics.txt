Didn't Understand Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Crushed up in her hand.

And we slid down on the beach and sand.

And i could not let go.

Rearrange in your head to see her hair here on your bed.

Outside it's so cold and i don't want to let it go.

Soft and sweet her cheeks turn red in a blush from your smile.

It warms up your heart and runs your head another mile.

It's the last breath for you're in the cold cold car.

Tangled hair in my arms.

Rearrange in your head to see her hair here on your bed.

Outside it's so cold and i don't want to let it go.
