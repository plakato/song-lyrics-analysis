Act Lyrics
by Unnamed.


I already had a girl, I didn't want you for sex.
She's a special girl, don't wanna make her another ex.
I remember the days we'd walk up and down the high street.
And it didn't bother me when I got blisters on my feet.
Because I had fun, you were nothing like my other friends.
And when we were done, the boredom had no end.
My girlfriend thought I was cheating on her with you.
She didn't believe me when I said you had someone else too.
You were a good friend and I thought you really liked me.
Even though in tough times you weren't right beside me.
Now me and all of my friends have agreed.
You're a bitch for leaving me just because I smoked weed.

Why do people act this way?
They leave you alone.
When they swore they'd stay.

You took me to the beach and we played in the sand.
You'd come and pick me up, you'd even hold my hand.
All a child can ask for is the presence of his Dad.
And that was the only thing that this little kid had.
You got my birthday in ink, Pop, like Kid.
Showed me music, taught me to rock, like Kid.
You carried me on your shoulders when my legs started hurting.
And it didn't bother me that you and my Mum had closed the curtain.
Because she didn't need you, but I did.
You should have been there for your oldest kid.
I know I should forgive you, but when all is said and done.
Fuck a Granddad, you'll never get the chance to meet my Son.

I don't want you, I'm better off without you.
I don't give a single shit or flying fuck about you.
I have other friends and I will have more.
And none of them would be annoying, stupid, blonde whores.
And as for my Dad, well, he can suck a cock.
He used to be there for me and then he fucked off.
