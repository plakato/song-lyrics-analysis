Wait For Me Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Aye shawty.
Don't worry about them other niggas they corny.
Don't worry about them other bitches they bore me.
I'm straight forward.
I can't call it.
That's why I don't pick up the phone when they call me.
So wait for me.
Made mistakes I ain't afraid to say sorry.
Your friends hating on me.
Girl why you ain't want me.
Wait for me.
Wait for me, wait for me.
Wait for me.
Wait for me, wait for me.
Wait for me.

Its our world.
He can't kill our vibe girl.
Judging by your options, you got hella time girl.
Let me open up your mind girl.
Now I hope you that's mine girl.
Why girl, do you keep so much inside girl.
Tried girl, cause you know love can leave you blind girl.
Call that nigga and cut off that nigga.
Can't wait to show you off to all my niggas.

Aye shawty.
Don't worry about them other niggas they corny.
Don't worry about them other bitches they bore me.
I'm straight forward.
I can't call it.
That's why I don't pick up the phone when they call me.
So wait for me.
I Made mistakes I ain't afraid to say sorry.
Your friends hating on me.
Girl why you ain't want me.
Wait for me.
Wait for me, wait for me.
Wait for me.
Wait for me, wait for me.
Wait for me.

You got all them lame niggas standing at you door step.
You say he your man I can turn that boy to your ex.
But how was he before sex.
Cause baby girl you're blessing.
Every king needs a Coretta.
I'm good but you're better.
Forever.
I want you forever.

Aye shawty.
Don't worry about them other niggas they corny.
Don't worry about them other bitches they bore me.

That's why I don't pick up the phone when they call me.
So wait for me.
Made mistakes I ain't afraid to say sorry.
Your friends hating on me.
Girl why you ain't want me.
Wait for me.

Hello baby its me.
I see you're not with your girl anymore.
So I'm guessing you have some free time for me right.
I miss you.
Maybe we can go to a movie.
Or get a bite to eat.
Go to some of the shops downtown.
Let me know.
Hope to see you soon darling.
Bye.
I know that's not my dick but I want it.
I've been had it so why can't I have it again.
Hi my baby.
I miss you.
And i'm blowing up your phone cause i'm drunk.
I'm sorry, bye.
