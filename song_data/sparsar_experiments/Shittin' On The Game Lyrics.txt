Shittin' On The Game Lyrics
by Yung B from Farlin.


I'm fenna take 'em back, so I can take 'em forward.
My life is like a movie, it's always on record.
I feel like Master P, somebody watching me.
Wouldn't trade it for the world, cause I love being me.

Yung B from Farlin.
Cherelle know that I be sipping on that Remy Remy.
And Punkin know that I be bopping out my mind silly.
Nikitta know that if I got it, sis its all good.
And Che my baby, but she know I love the fucking hood.
Naheem AroshkaBoshkyaFuckya what my 'momma' call me.
And Kita Beata know I keep a, keep a party started.
And Lucy Lucy, yeah she love that Boosie, Boosie, Boosie.
I let that ride, then play that Gucci cause my chain Stoopid.
And as for Mya, yeah she know she got that fire.
I couldn't help it I was wired, let her ride me like some tires.
And Tatiauna wanna be my baby momma, but I'm good on all that drama.
I'd rather get this money, I be shittin' on the game.
Been through all this struggle, I'm gone make you feel my pain.
Back from out of state, I'm in that rental switching lanes.
Jimmy that's my nigga, let him manage everythang, I'm a underground.
king.

Yung B from Farlin.
I be shittin' on the game.
I be shittin' on the game.
I be shittin' on the game every time I get a chance.
I'm a muthafuckin' hustler, it's a must I be the man.

I be shittin' on the game.
I be shittin' on the game.
I be shittin' on the game every time I get a chance.
If you never ran your city, you wouldn't even understand.

Yung B from Farlin.
Damn I know she got some fire.
And when she open up, I'm trying to get hired.
Don't be bullshitting girl shut up and take dick.
Man it's something 'bout a brad that can swallow don't spit.
I'm feeling my self, she feeling me too.
If I was you and you was me--then I would fuck me too.
Sipping Bud Ice, got me throwed than a mug.
I'm in college, getting knowledge, but she know that I'm a thug.
Got a nigga bouncing on the floor, bouncing on the walls.
Got her in the shower making noise, tapping on the walls.
Let me rub this soap across yo body, you lil' sexy thang.
Fucking with the realest nigga in it, shittin' on the game.
Girl I be shittin' on the game.
Been through all this struggle, I'm gone make you feel my pain.
Back from out of state, I'm in that rental switching lanes.
Jimmy that's my nigga let him manage everythang, I'm a underground king.

Yung B from Farlin.
I be shittin' on the game.
I be shittin' on the game.
I be shittin' on the game every time I get a chance.
I'm a muthafuckin' hustler, it's a must I be the man.

I be shittin' on the game.
I be shittin' on the game.
I be shittin' on the game every time I get a chance.
If you never ran your city, you wouldn't even understand.
