Aether Lyrics
by NuLOVE.

Yeah.
I want you to rock the boat.
Hoeing ass. You ain't notice that niggas in the streets taking shells to the.

I want you to rock the boat.
Its been 9 months and 10 days.
In a jury you'll get my vote.
On the 11th of every month we celebrate.
But nowadays I'm really starting to develop hate.
Rock the boat, rock the boat.
Stroke it for me.
There now hold me close.
I met you back in the 12th grade.
Applying lotion to her, I guess thats no notion to her.
I cruise with the devil, my shoes on the pedal, them bitches imported from.
Rock the boat.
Ooh baby I love your stroke.
Rock the boat, rock the boat.
But nowadays I'm really starting to develop hate.

New positions, new positions.
I believe you know just what you doing now.
Until you reach the shore.
Boy you know you make me float.
Work the middle, work the middle.
But on the floor is where your shirt should be.
New positions, new positions.
Rock the boat.
On the 11th of every month we celebrate.
Rocking shows, I rock the boat, throw your clothes all on the floor.
I'm tryna see eternity.
And I be missing those times when we rode bikes to picnics.
Rock the boat.
Aaliyah.
New positions, new positions.
Best believe that, if you let a nigga in between that.
That's too slow.
Work the middle, work the middle.
I feel like I'm on dope.
Rock the boat.
Like you never ever used to do before.
Rock the boat.
I met you back in the 12th grade.
Change positions, new positions.
Stroke it for me.
Cause you, cause you get me to where I'm going.
Work the middle.
New positions, new positions.
Change positions, new positions.
Boy let's take this overboard now.
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me.

Rock the boat.
Rock the boat.
Cause I believe.

My nigga 'bout to bust out the weed bags, Cheif that, we blowing that.
face.
Girl can't you see we're tryna relax? Put your feet up, put your seat back.
To explore my body.
back, with your.
Work the middle, work the middle.
Let me get a deal right quick. Want to know what Heavens like? Get a feel.
Change positions, new positions.
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me.
You have me walking around like an emotional blur.
Girl can't you see I'm tryna beat that, put your feet up, put your knees back.
Got my name across her toes, I could be your pot of gold.
Aaliyah - Rock The Boat.
And please don't look for something in me, I'm a good for nothing.
Best believe that, hunger in my eyes you can see that.
Stroke it for me.
So she can have all the flowers she likes.
That I'm in it, until my life is finished.

And ain't beating around the bush, I'm just trimming off the hedge.
NuLOVE.
Chip on your shoulder I told you thats where your purse should be.
Yeah all the flower she likes.
Cause you, you serve me on a regular.
Boy you know you make me float.
Choking on that potent everytime I be toking that herb.


Work the middle.
Rock the boat.
Cease to her knees she's blowing that, I can see your Love Pink, she throw it.
Oooh Stroke It.
Stroke it for me.
Something so unique about you. My knees weak around you.
Its been 9 months and 10 days.
Boy we need to tie this rope.
I'm out here tryna win taking L's to the face. We could prolly fall in love if.
Boycott.
Thats that real life shit. You know the flow to make them niggas feel.
If I could pay my flight fare you almost guarantee that I would not be right.
Left hand on that wood grain, I'm passing the dutch with my right hand.
I couldn't survive a week without you. Let alone a day.
I feel like I'm on dope.
Stroke it baby, Stroke it baby.
Work the middle.
Lying by the ocean with her.
it fell into place.
But I'm left alone today.
Cause you, you serve me on a regular.
Thailand nigga.
A little hoodlum running on no sleep.
Before we drift any deeper.
You'll be calling, calling for more.
And I admit it now I'm living on the edge.

Forever. Imma tourist in this world.
Dont take it personally cuz we're certain to be together.
There is somethin' I want you to do.
Mmmm, Work it baby, Work it baby.
Work the middle, work the middle.
Work the middle.
No sugar coating, cuz I'm not cooking nothing.
Boy you really get me high.
You might have got hot headed but I never got cold feet she said.
Go ahead and put that thing in over drive.
I want you to rock the boat.
Change positions, new positions.
Stroke it for me.
right quick.

I need you to use yourself.
Rock the boat, rock the boat.
Just don't get in a hurry.
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me.
Rock the boat, rock the boat.
You have me rolling over in my sleep thinking bout you.
Baby now we can coast.
Boy you really get me high.
Can I have a flourist for my girl?
What a nightmare nigga. Yeah I been real since high chairs nigga.
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me.
