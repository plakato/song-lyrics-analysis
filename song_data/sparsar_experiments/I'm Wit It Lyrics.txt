I'm Wit It Lyrics
by 702.

You got a lot of character.
The way that you carry yourself.
The way you talk to me.
You was tangible, so respectful, unforgettable.
Baby I love the way you be wit me.
So why you coming at me about material things.
When I've never asked you for nothing.
It don't matter bout what you be having.

Boy stop it because I could care less.
What you got in your pocket.
Even though I must admit it's hot when you stop.
And the wheels keep spinning.
That's not the reason I'm wit it.
It don't fade me I'm happy that you.
Out there making yo money.
And yeah I like it we in the drop.
And the top down wind be blowing.
But baby that's not why I'm wit it.

You got good manners, you always be to yourself.
You really impress me.
So don't go messing up being silly.
Cause you got your trust.
I understand you're doing good.
But don't let that go to your head.
Cause I could do with it Or I could do without it.
And don't you ever get it twisted.

Boy stop it because I could care less.
What you got in your pocket.
Even though I must admit it's hot when you stop.
And the wheels keep spinning.
That's not the reason I'm wit it.
It don't fade me I'm happy that you.
Out there making yo money.
And yeah I like it we in the drop.
And the top down wind be blowing.
But baby that's not why I'm wit it.

Why you tripping on the things you have.
And all the things you got, it's your's not mine.
I'm not tripping on where you live or the car that you drive.
Boy you got your's and I got mine.
