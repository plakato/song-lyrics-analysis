TripleX Lyrics
by Xavery Williams.


Lights' bright so my eyes shine 
I'm only as good as my last line 
And. I think that that's fucked up 
Let me make some swag rap shit. 
Deep words. They don't feel that shit, 
Floss ... hm- be a boss, ... 
Yeah ..., whatever the fuckin' cost 
Well. My life worth is worth more than the fame 
Right 
 
Triple X, pics of my ex on my phone 
That's. The only reason that I still wan na bone, 
 
Lights' bright, so my eyes shine 
I'm only as good as my last line 
And. I think that that's fucked up 
Let me make some swag rap shit. 
Deep words. They don't feel that shit, 
Floss ... hm- be a boss, ... 
Yeah ..., whatever the fuckin' cost 
Well. My life worth is worth more than the fame 
Right 
 
Crew. My homies is that set 
I'm ready now, let's wreck 
No nikes on, I won't pay two 0 for a check. 
That nonsense is priceless. 
That rapper that remains iceless, 
 
Sometimes I fuck up, but sometimes I luck up 
But most times I do right. I do right with no fights 
My mind's zen and my soul wins 
But. Even though here we go again, 
Your friends say the same shit 
And. I just can't believe it 
 
Hint of Mints with tips, of
kush 
I, light up that WTF 
I read books and catch crooks, 
Maxin' out in my own nook, 
 
I rap a lot, but don't talk a lot 
I ride a lot, but don't walk a lot 
Surfin' On that bamboo 
Two/to problems that I say, shoo 
 
Freedom on four wheels. 
I need that to feel real 
That speed can be my medicine 
Inventing moves like Edison 
My mode's different, my flow's different 
I know where I'm going with it. 
 
I love all and hug trees, 
I love all and hug trees. 
Where you at 
 
Fucked up .... I think that I fucked up 
If I wake up. Then I lucked up 
What I dreamed about is who she is 
And, even though you get what you want. 
It doesn't mean that you win 
 
Suave-Set, no swag rap 
Fairy tales. I don't wag that 
Bag back-, like a backpack 
Or, get broke off like a kit. Kat 
 
That's renaissance to caveman 
I'm down to be the new rave man 
I write lines like rain main 
But. I stay-stay-stay- with the same plan. 
 
That's do right and fuckin' live life, 
Be love and be a fuckin' bright light, 
Yeah .... What the hell am. I on 
Me Z, X and some extra strong 
 
Make, your ass clap, make your pussy snap 
So deep, so wet my dick's swimmmin' laps 
Make, your ass clap, make your pussy 
So deep, so wet my dick's swimmin' laps, 
 
I'm thinking these thoughts because I'm sitting All alone 
And my main squeeze's in a different time zone 
Thinking these thoughts, because I'm sitting all alone 
And my main squeeze's in a different time zone, 
, 
So .... This is all I got: 
 
Triple X, pics of my ex on my phone 
That's. The only reason that I still wan na bone 
 
That's the only reason that I still wan na bone, 
 
Haha, ..., psyche
