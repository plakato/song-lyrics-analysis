TripleX Lyrics
by Xavery Williams.


Lights' bright, so my eyes shine.
I'm only as good as my last line.
And I think that, that's fucked up.
Let me make some swag rap shit.
Deep words, they don't feel that shit.
Floss... hm- be a boss....
Yeah... whatever the fuckin' cost.
Well my life worth is worth more than the fame.
Right?

Triple X pics of my ex on my phone.
That's the only reason that I still wanna bone.

Lights' bright, so my eyes shine.
I'm only as good as my last line.
And I think that, that's fucked up.
Let me make some swag rap shit.
Deep words, they don't feel that shit.
Floss... hm- be a boss....
Yeah... whatever the fuckin' cost.
Well my life worth is worth more than the fame.
Right?

Crew, my homies is that set.
I'm ready, now let's wreck.
No nikes on, I won't pay two 0 for a check.
That nonsense is priceless.
That rapper that remains iceless.

Sometimes I fuck up, but sometimes I luck up.
But most times I do right, I do right with no fights.
My mind's zen and my soul wins.
But even though here we go again.
Your friends say the same shit.
And I just can't believe it.

Hint of Mints with tips of.
kush.
I light up that WTF.
I read books and catch crooks.
Maxin' out in my own nook.

I rap a lot but don't talk a lot.
I ride a lot but don't walk a lot.
Surfin' on that bamboo.
Two/to problems that I say shoo!

Freedom on four wheels.
I need that to feel real.
That speed can be my medicine.
Inventing moves like Edison.
My mode's different, my flow's different.
I know where I'm going with it.

I love all and hug trees.
I love all and hug trees.
Where you at?

Fucked up... I think that I fucked up.
If I wake up, then I lucked up.
What I dreamed about is who she is.
And even though you get what you want.
It doesn't mean that you win.

Suave-Set, no swag rap.
Fairy tales, I don't wag that.
Bag back- like a backpack.
Or get broke off, like a kit kat.

That's renaissance to caveman.
I'm down to be the new rave, man.
I write lines like rain main.
But I stay-stay-stay- with the same plan.

That's do right and fuckin' live life.
Be love and be a fuckin' bright light.
Yeah... what the hell am I on?
Me, Z, X and some extra strong.

Make your ass clap, make your pussy snap.
So deep, so wet, my dick's swimmmin' laps.
Make your ass clap,  make your pussy.
So deep, so wet, my dick's swimmin' laps.

I'm thinking these thoughts, because I'm sitting all alone.
And my main squeeze's in a different time zone.
Thinking these thoughts, because I'm sitting all alone.
And my main squeeze's in a different time zone.

So...this is all I got.

Triple X pics of my ex on my phone.
That's the only reason that I still wanna bone.

That's the only reason that I still wanna bone.

Haha...psyche.
