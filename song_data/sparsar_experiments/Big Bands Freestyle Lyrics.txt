Big Bands Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


Fuck my phone, that me.
Let me see if that shit in my pocket hold on.
Yeah !
Who the fuck is this tweakin' me ?
I don't know you nigga.
Yeah !
You better pop a menthos.
Turn up, turn up, turn up.
Yeah !
Shut up &amp; vibe.
2.7.5.

Double cup of that kickstand.
All I know is big bands.
All I know is big bands.
All I know is big bands.

BUM BUM BUM !
All I know is them big bands.
Like I'm tryna get it, I gotta get it.
All I know is them big bands.
All black chucks, 305 fitted.
All I know is I love cash.
You can die slow tryna live fast.
All I know is I keep it G.
Got a bad bitch &amp; she sleep with me.
All I know is too easy.
Bass drop &amp; I get steezy.
Wake me up if I'm dreamin'.
2 women that's double teamin'.
2 shots to get a double treament.
I leave 'em leakin' bodies on the cement.
Double cup of that trippy shit.
We trippin' out on a trippy stick.
Never hatin' never waitin'.
I'm not a doctor I ain't got patients.
Niggas talk but can't walk it out.
We can't smoke nor talk it out.
Real shit what I'm talking 'bout.
All I know is get it don't get caught with it.
All I know is get it don't get caught with it.
BUM BUM BUM !

Yeah.
Yung Simmie.
Now I'm 'bout like I laugh.
Yeah.
Shouts out to ??
All I know is 2.7.5.
Yeah.
What you know nigga ?
Yung Simmie.
We turnin' up to another level nigga.
And my boy ?? ??
Yeah.
