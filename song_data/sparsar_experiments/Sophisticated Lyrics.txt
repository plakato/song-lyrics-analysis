Sophisticated Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.


There she goes, pulling up.
Hoppin' out the latest Beamer truck.
Makeup running, that's alright.
Pretty face, nice thighs.
Bad' than a motherfucker.
Fire bomb, can't nobody else touch her.
Can't believe what I'm seeing.
Shawty's amazing, I ain't playin' when I'm sayin'.

She's sophisticated, get it, yeah.
She's sophisticated, get it, yeah.
But she says she likes the bad boys.
Well baby I'm a bad boy.
She's sophisticated, jaded, and headed out to Vegas.
With her Louis V bags and her matching suite cases.
And I know your heart is breakin' but baby what you waiting for.
We out here, we out here.
She won't be sophisticated when we get a little faded, we out here.

Another martini, one for the PYT goes well with the scenery.
She can look fly whippin' a Hyundai or a goddamn Lamborghini.
Baby love why you lookin' so sad.
Make a night that you won't forget, we out here, fuck yeah.

If you're sophisticated baby put ya hands up.
If you fancy and you know it got your Louis bag to show it.
Your hair and nails done, man somebody should of told me she's so.
sophisticated.
