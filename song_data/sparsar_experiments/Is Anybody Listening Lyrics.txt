Is Anybody Listening Lyrics
by Unda Preshur.


I'm taking what I can with a weapon or force.
Checking my record is kinda like when you step in a storm.
I'm giving all my best and it's yours, I was cut from a different cloth.
You could tell from the very second I was born.

Soon as the kick rumbles feel it rush in my veins.
Guiding emotion through the pen an now I'm lovin the pain.
Cause if it's something to you then for me it's something to gain.
I'm a different person when my pen touches the page.

Using ink as a medium so you can relate to me.
Never pictured myself a rapper but music became a dream.
I ain't blind by the coloured paper that's stupidly shaded green.
I'm only human, a human can make the scene.

All the talent in the world couldn't make me a staple.
In the rap game, so I assume I have to take when I'm able.
I have dreams of being with the greatest rappers that rhyme.
Release a couple albums that happened to be platinum and climb.

To the top of the charts, you can stop for a moment.
But deep inside you truly know there ain't no stopping the heart.
I was playin at the start, but that mood soon changed.
Now I display it as art, and I'mma chew through brains.

Is anybody listening.
Who feel like me and feel like they in my position too.
I only have my life to give.
You need to understand that I gotta do this for you.

Is anybody listening.
Who feel like me and feel like they in my position too.
They only love you when dead and gone.
I cherish every moment because I know it's the truth.

Soon as the kick rumbles feel it rush in my veins.
Guiding emotion through the pen an now I'm lovin the pain.
Cause if it's something to you then for me it's something to gain.
I'm a different person when my pen touches the page.

Using ink as a medium so you can relate to me.
Never pictured myself a rapper but music became a dream.
I ain't blind by the coloured paper that's stupidly shaded green.
I'm only human, a human can make the scene.

Is anybody listening.
Who feel like me and feel like they in my position too.
I only have my life to give.
You need to understand that I gotta do this for you.

Is anybody listening.
Who feel like me and feel like they in my position too.
They only love you when dead and gone.
I cherish every moment because I know it's the truth.
