Another You (Remix) Lyrics
by The World Famous Tony Williams.


It don't really matter what you do.
There'll never be another you.
They ain't never been up in your shoes.
There'll never be another you.
It don't really matter what you do.
There'll never be another you.
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove.
There'll never be another you.

Thanks for having me Tony, you know.
She got money from her last two exes.
No kids, new Jag, new Lexus.
And cook a bad ass breakfast.
Just incredible, how the sex is.
So I leave her but then I come right back.
She be catchin' attitude and I don't like that.
Wanna talk that shit, I'mma strike back.
Only for the makeup sex and the night cap.
They got a bed on the beach and.
My thing got beef with your coochie.
Got money, still sneak in the movie.
Love the adventure and when you do me.
I heard last man, soft ass friend like macho man.
Lil' tight ass shirt on, let's just call him not your man.
I'm just saying.

F.G., all these, freak bitches wanna sex me.
But due to the fact I'm a mac with a mothafuckin' sack.
Man a bitch can't stress me.
I'm with Alicia, Lauren, and Leslie.
Miami rooftop Cabana.
Heard they fucked my crew from Atlanta.
Now I'm tryna hit it so pardon my manners.
I was born with it so pardon this pimpin'.
Can't learn nothin' talkin', bitch listen.
Need a thick rare thing up in my bed frame.
You look like you fit that description.
Get up in the GT and get missin'.
Push button start, the keyless ignition.
Whole damn thing, it cost me 240.
'Fore I left the lot I slapped it on Forgi's, uh.
And it don't really matter what you do.
Cause I don't know another chick like you.
From the back to the front to the side.
Ain't another nigga doin' it like I do.
Smoked out, I'm toasted.
Fucked the bitch and made her lose focus.
Off another dose of this dope dick.
Tell all your friends, girl, promote this it's Gibbs.

You know a nigga need that one thing.
She want a nigga that's stunting.
Every time she pitch, I grand slam.
Say her man be bunting.
Well tonight, we going hunting.
She like women like I do.
Damn, well tonight we can try two.
Damn, where the fuck a nigga find you?
You know a nigga mentally fucked up.
Prolly on the bud, walk up in the club, get all the love.
All because a nigga fucks with Cud.
And even Kanye sees me, he says what's up.
Tony I think I found the one.
But she can't talk, her man is home.
I told her save my name as Shaft Long in her damn phone.

Here's another day in the life of a champion, knight.
Do I do some fight, I'm ashamed but I might.
Whether wrong, wheather right.
Its a dangerous sight.
Are we going in.

I'm feeling like Stevie right now, you knowâ€¦
I had the strangest feeling lately.
The nigga's so fake I'm off it.
And every time they flake like frosted.
I just make my profit.
And get a girl who barely bra fit.
Aw shit! He back on his feet like carpet.
He was just playing possum.
Playing like I wasn't awesome?
Yeah I got some jokes, don't I?
Ha ha ha, laugh it up.
And they'll be wack.
And we'll be the last ones cracking up.
Matter fact, because you nigga wanna doubt me?
Let's see how it feel without me.
Taking off on this rocket, Yao Ming.
