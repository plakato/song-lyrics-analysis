Interlude Lyrics
by Yung Berg.

Yung Berg.
Yeah.
You know, always been a starter yung'un don't do beach.
Home grind derby, I'm headed for the feets.
But instead of niggas standin up and cheer for me.
Wanna see my momma cry, homies pour beer for me.
I mean, once again I'm a product what you made me.
Solid as a Roc I couldn't sign with Jay-Z.
See first Infrared, and then Bloodline.
Now I'm a young boss and shorty it's grill time.
Back tatted for my niggas cause I love mine.
And now this real talk, is no punchline.
Yeah, and I ain't speakin no riddles.
My bro had squares with stamps in the middle.
He used to take trips they would pack up the rental.
Pop was at the crib, still workin on a demo.
Yung livin reckless, blowin on chronic.
Momma sent me off to school, said her son was demonic.
Secluded from the world, I couldn't see trees.
But it gave me time to grow a little, time to do me.
Writin raps in my head no beat.
Fucked up bed, one pillow, no sheet.
And my pops wrote a letter in about a month it reads.
Your time's comin soon you'll be out in a week.
I moved out to Cali with my big sister Eve.
She had faith in a yung'un she just told me BELIEVE~!
Believe {*echoes*}.
