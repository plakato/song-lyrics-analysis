Long Way Down Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.


You were the one that would say.
We were one in the same.
But now it's in you, it's in you always.
And on the heels of the days.
When all words were saved.
But now it's in you, it's in you always.

And on the face of it, it's never forgetting.
Don't follow it down, the clocks are indebted.

It's long way down.
They don't need to let you know that.
Long way down.
It's a long way down.
They don't need to let you know that.
Long way down.

Far from the cracks in the bay.
Down town the worries will make.
But now it's in you, it's in you always.
Find all your reasons to stay.
Half time it slows to a quake.
But now it's on you, it's on you always.

And on the face of it, it's never forgetting.
Don't follow it down, the clocks are indebted.

It's long way down.
They don't need to let you know that.
Long way down.
It's a long way down.
They don't need to let you know that.
Long way down.

They don't need to.

They don't need to.

They don't need to.

They don't need to.

It's long way down.
They don't need to let you know that.
Long way down.
It's a long way down.
They don't need to let you know that.
Long way down.
