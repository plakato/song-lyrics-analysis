Booty Drop Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.

Thrill Da Playa.

Come on, I'm speakin' up.
All the big-booty girls in the club.
Wussup with the table-top?
Get up on, and make that booty drop.
If you want this pay.
You got to work baby, I ain't goin' any way.
It ain't 'bout no hand-out.
It's 'bout g-strings and booty-cheeks hangin' out.
Cause I'ma get my money's worth.
So make that booty, hips and tongue work!
Cause I'll nickel-and-dime ya.
If you fail to work what's behind ya.
But if the dance get felt.
Then I'll stick a dub in ya garter belt.
So make these ends.
Cause it's me, and some of my big-money friends.
But ya can't be no flop.
Just stop - and make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, c'mon, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} Don't try to flaunt, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, c'mon, hey, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, bring.
it on.
Just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, c'mon, baby, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} Yeah! I like that, just ....
{True dat, true dat!} Bring it on, bring it on, just make that.
booty ....
{True dat, true dat!}.

Thrill Da Playa.

Drop it on one, then on two.
What you gon' do?
Don't hold that wallet.
There's room on the floor for the both of us.
And this my last chance.
Before I dip to get this lap-dance.
And they playin' the funk.
Work that skirt and make that booty jump.
Shake it down turn around.
Now touch the ground.
Go 'head and do it.
And I'ma get a lil' closer to it.
It's plenty head room.
So work that thing like we in the bedroom.
Work what you got.
Get on the dance floor and make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, c'mon, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} Yeah! I like that, just ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, and make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} Yeah! I like that, just ....
{True dat, true dat!} Work it out, work it out, just make it ....
{True dat, true dat!} Yeah! I like that, just ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!}.

Go 'head and do it!
Shake it baby don't stop!

Thrill Da Playa.

Shake it, baby, don't stop.
On the dance floor or on the table-top.
And you're aaight!
See if you can make my nature rise.
You got the equipment.
Now you need just a lil' commitment.
You bring that milkshake and the Puddin Tame.
And I'll bring the g-string.
And a lil' bit of extra flow.
Sit and stare and watch that booty go.
Come on, I'm speakin' up.
All the big-booty girls in the club.
Don't try to flex.
One time for Magic City AND Rolexx.
Cause them the spots.
To stop - and make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, c'mon, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} Don't try to flaunt, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, c'mon, hey, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, bring.
it on.
Just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} C'mon, c'mon, baby, just make that booty ....
{True dat, true dat!} Yeah! I like that, just ....
{True dat, true dat!} Bring it on, bring it on, just make that.
booty ....
{True dat, true dat!}.
