Jesus doesn't know my name.
He charge me fifty bucks a gram.

Smoke don't shoot that ope.
Dwight dissolved in acid rain.
Tears are falling down.

Messed with Polly and Marie.
Took some xany and addy.
Does this mean you'll never blow me again?
Love dissolved in acid rain.
Tears are falling down.

You and I are doomed to burn.
Like white people in the sun.
Proxy man, drinkin' a blood and sand.
I'll dissolve in acid rain.
Tears are falling down.
