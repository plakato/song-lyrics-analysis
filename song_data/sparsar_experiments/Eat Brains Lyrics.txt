Eat Brains Lyrics
by Swing Dee Diablo.


There's Only One Thing In This World That I Crave.
I Wanna Eat BRAINS.
Rip Your Head From Your Frame.
Drink Your Blood Like It's Tang.
I Wanna EAT BRAINS.
I Can Smell You From Over Here.
Your Fear Equals Pain.
I Wanna Eat Brains.
I'm HUNGRY And You'Re The Entire Food Chain.
I Wanna Eat Brains.

Yeah.

I Have No Soul.
There's No Heaven,No Hell.
All I Crave Is Brains.
I Can Find You.
All I Need Is Your Smell.
I'm A Demonic Abomination.
Taking Over The Whole Nation.
Rip your Guts Out your Stomach.
Do It With No Hatred.
You're The Whole Food Chain.
And I Wanna Eat.
Leave Your Body Ripped Apart.
Laying In The Street.
We The Walking Dead.
And Your Wife and Son Gonna Die.
You Don't Need Them No More.
Ni%4a No Lie.
Get It Through Your Head.
I'm Gonna Pull Your Cap Back.
And EAT BRAINS.
I'm Not Alive.
You Gotta Be Alive To Be Insane.
When I Was Alive.
I Was A Really Bad Guy.
M4H Rape Pillage Retire.

Before I Died.
Back In The 1920's.
30 Ni%$s Died from My Guns.
Since The 1930's.
I've Been Resting Here At.
Dunz.
But My Soul Never Rested.
It Was For Ever Tormented.
For My Sins I Was Forever Damned.
The UnForgiven.

There's Only One Thing In This World That I Crave.
I Wanna Eat BRAINS.
Rip Your Head From Your Frame.
Drink Your Blood Like It's Tang.
I Wanna EAT BRAINS.
I Can Smell You From Over Here.
Your Fear Equals Pain.
I Wanna Eat Brains.
I'm HUNGRY And You'Re The Entire Food Chain.
I Wanna Eat Brains.
