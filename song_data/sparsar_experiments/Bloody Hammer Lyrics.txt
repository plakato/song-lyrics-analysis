Bloody Hammer Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.

Demon is up in the attic to the left.
My eye turns to the left to say, No.
You said, First, I am the special one.
I never hammered my mind out.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody.
I never have the bloody.
I never have the bloody hammer.

I am the doctor.
I am the psychiatrist.
To make sure they don't think that they'd hammer their minds out.
Or that they'd have a.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody.
I never have the bloody.
Or that they'd have a bloody hammer.

Second, I am the special one.
My eyes, green and blue.
And safely unbegotten.
To the left to say, No.
While the others with their hair turned white.
They just roll their eyes back to the top of their head.
And hammer the attic floor with a bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody.
I never have the bloody.
I never have the bloody hammer.

It's not a sledgehammer.
It's not a chisel.
It's not a train.
But a thought of unlimited horror for Dr. O'Chane.
Dr. O'Chane.

Baby ghost says beat it with your chains.
Baby ghost says don't drag your chain away, Dr. O'Chane.

Doctor O'Chane, Doctor O'Chane.
The baby ghost says, Beat it with your chain.
The baby ghost says, Drag your chain away, Doctor O'Chane.

The ghost says, Beat it with your chains.
The ghost says, Drag your chain away, Dr. O'Trey.

All bats are is Dracula vampires.
Vampires in rain.
Vampires in lightning for Dr. O'Chane.
Dr. O'Chane.

The baby ghost in the 1900's says, Beat it with your chain.
The baby ghost says.
Don't drag your spoon, drag your chain away, Dr. O'Chane.

Demon is up in the attic to the left.
My eye turns to the left to say, No.
You said, First, I am the special one.
I never hammer my mind out.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody hammer.
I never have the bloody.
I never have the bloody.
I never have the bloody hammer.
