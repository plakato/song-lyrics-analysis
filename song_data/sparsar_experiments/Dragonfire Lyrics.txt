Dragonfire Lyrics
by Virus Syndicate.


Off the chain no shackles on.
Free spirit black and yellow blood up up.

I'm off the chain no shackles on my brain.
I'm a free spirit black and yellow.
Blood up in my veins.

I'm off the chain no shackles on my brain.

I'm a free spirit black and yellow.
Blood up in my veins.
I'm a monsta-sta-sta-sta-sta-sta-sta.
I guess I best show you what I'm on.

Told me it couldn't be done.
Told em it wouldn't be fun.
Proving em wrong.
I am the one.
Not even close, shall I move on.
I know for certain man are hurting.
Cause it's curtains.
What makes it even worse is I'm the guy that stopped 'em earning.
I set the wheel in motion.
Man I tell 'em keep it turning.
It's subliminal I tell em it's alternative learning.
Return of the king return of the hype.
I'm like you had your fun now return me the mic.
I guess I best show you what I'm on.
Killin' em softly's way too costly.
But they cross me.
So I shut the 'ting down tell em bitches get off me.
You hear me loud and clear.
It's over do you copy.
Trust me there's nothing that anyone could do to stop me.

I'm a free spirit black and yellow.
Blood up in my veins.
I'm a monster.
Product of this game.
I embrace fire breathing.
Dragon fire spitting from my face.

I'm a slick talker.
Fucking serenade your bitch like I'm Rick Walker.
I'm a renegade I switch on a shit talker.
I'm a sick author.
Lock your doors cause I'm coming for your fit daughter.
I'm a rockstar.
Cocaine sniff it off a cop's car.
Propane fire when I drop bars.
Mic don.
Somebody switch the fucking lights on.
Mosh pit.
Go fucking sick yo he's lost it.
Fuck your whole campaign you're a wank stain.
I pour cheap sambuca in your champagne.
Yo I couldn't give a fuck where your band played.
Virus.
Jag skillz ninjas on a rampage.

I'm a free spirit black and yellow.
Blood up in my veins.
I'm a monster.
Product of this game I'm a monster.
M-m-monster.

Rhyming road ranger.
The guy with road rage.
In a range the flow's danger.
The guy in a rave raving.
With blades and two tazers.
Faded off flake nasal.
To brain with no chaser.
Drinking straight laced I'm insane.
DEEZAL POWER.
I can't leave the world without my mark printed on it.
See me coursing up a stir.
With earth's collision with a comet.
Born into this world then spat out like I was vomit.
I'm back out and now I'm bombing anyone who really wants it.

I'm off the chain no shackles on my brain.
I'm a free spirit black and yellow.
Blood up in my veins.
I'm a monster.
Product of this game.
I embrace fire breathing.
Dragon fire spitting from my face.

I'm off the chain no shackles on.
Free spirt black and yellow blood up up.
