End Up Here Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


You walked in everyone was.
Asking for your name.
You just smiled and told them 'trouble'.
My head spins.
I'm pressed against the wall.
Just watching your every move.
You're way too cool and you're coming.
This way, coming this way.

How did we end up.
Talking in the first place.
You said you liked my Cobain shirt.
Now we're walking, back to your place.
You're telling me how you love that.
Song about living like a prayer.
I'm pretty sure that.
We're halfway there.
But when I wake up next to you.
I wonder how.
How did we end up here.
_How did we end up.
How did we end up here?_.

Next day out.
Everybody thought you were so insane.
Cause you were so far out, of my league.
My friends said I should lock you down.
Before you figure me out.
And you run away.
But you don't and you won't.
As you kiss me and.
You tell me that you're here to stay.

How did we end up.
Talking in the first place.
You said you liked my Cobain shirt.
Now we're walking, back to your place.
You're telling me how you love that.
Song about living like a prayer.
I'm pretty sure that.
We're halfway there.
But when I wake up next to you.
I wonder how.
How did we end up here.
_How did we end up.
How did we end up here?_.

Call me lucky cause in the end.
I'm a six and she's a ten.
She's so fit I'm insecure.
But she keeps coming back for more.

How did we end up.
Talking in the first place.
You said you liked my Cobain shirt.
Now we're walking, back to your place.
You're telling me how you love that.
Song about living like a prayer.
I'm pretty sure that.
We're halfway there.
But when I wake up next to you.
I wonder how.
How did we end up here.
_How did we end up.
How did we end up here?_.

How did we end up?
How did we end up here?
How did we end up?
How did we end up here?
