Right Now Lyrics
by Rushlow.

Close my eyes, life went by, where's all the time that I've wasted?
Just stood still, spun my wheels, isn't it time that I've faced it?
This moment I'm holdin' is all that I've got.
I took that for granted but this time I'm not.

Here's my one chance to hold you, here's my one chance to love you.
But right now I'm gonna take it, but right now, right now.
I'm gonna hang on to every minute, drink it up while I'm in it.
Right now I'm gonna live for, right now, right now.

I learned slow but now I know, we only get what were givin'.
Take my hand, jump on in, we've gotta love while we're livin'.
So run to me baby, don't hesitate.
Cause maybe tomorrow might be to late.

Here's my one chance to hold you, here's my one chance to love you.
But right now I'm gonna take it, but right now, right now.
I'm gonna hang on to every minute, drink it up while I'm in it.
Right now I'm gonna live for, right now, right now.

Here's my one chance to hold you, here's my one chance to love you.
But right now I'm gonna take it, right now, right now.
I'm gonna hang on to every minute, drink it up while I'm in it.
Right now I'm gonna live for, right now, right now.

Here's my one chance to hold you, here's my one chance to love you.
But right now I'm gonna take it, but right now, right now.
I'm gonna hang on to every minute, drink it up while I'm in it.
Right now I'm gonna live for, right now, well, right now, yeah.

Right now, right now, right now.
Well, right now, right now, yeah.
