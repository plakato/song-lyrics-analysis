Right Now Lyrics
by Rushlow.

Close my eyes, life went by where's all the time that I've wasted 
Just stood still spun my wheels. Isn'T it time that I've faced it 
This moment, I'm holdin' is all that I've got 
I took that for granted, but this time I'm not 
 
Here's. My one chance to hold you, here's my one chance to love you 
But right now, I'm gon na take it, but right now, right now, 
I'm gon na hang on to every minute drink it up, while I'm in it 
Right. Now, I'm gon na live for right. Now right now, 
 
I learned slow, but now I know we only get what were givin' 
Take my hand, jump on in we've got ta love while we're livin' 
So run to me, baby, don't hesitate. 
Cause, maybe tomorrow might be to late 
 
Here's my one chance to hold you, here's my one chance to love you 
But right now, I'm gon na take it, but right now, right now, 
I'm gon na hang on to every minute drink it up, while I'm in It 
Right now I'm gon na live for right now, right now, 
 
Here's, my one chance to hold you, here's my one chance to love you 
But right now, I'm gon na take it right now, right now, 
I'm gon na hang on to every minute drink. It up, while I'm in it 
Right now I'm gon na, live for right now, right now, 
 
Here's, my one chance to hold you, here's my one chance to love you 
But right now, I'm gon na take it, but right now, right now, 
I'm gon na hang On to every minute drink it up, while I'm in it 
Right now, I'm gon na live for right now. Well, right now, yeah 
, 
Right, now right now, right now, 
Well right now, right now, yeah
