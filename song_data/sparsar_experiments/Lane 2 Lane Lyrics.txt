Lane 2 Lane Lyrics
by Yungstar.


Swangin lane 2 lane in a dropper.
On the count of 3.
Southside roll choppers.

Me and James on jane as I swang down Main.
Lane 2 lane, music bang, residentials complain.
Some say it's a shame I'm grippin' to much grain.
Candy stains on both lanes, like a wet airplane.
Speed limit 45, what that mean to me?
I'ma skate like Grezky doin' 183.
On the strech, hard to catch, I'ma circle da' block.
Second time around your corner, I'm recline da' top.
Screens drop, trucks pop, do's lock, Glock cocked, next stop at IHOP.
We swang drop, bottoms flop.
MAKE IT HOT, MAKE IT HOT, is what da kids be yellin'.
Candies reds dey be dredin', pounds of smoke I'm in heaven.
I'm supreme, by any means, hovercraft with seven screens.
20 inches cutting sharper den the crease in my jeans.
Car hoppers, chase choppers, write my name across dey lockers.
Wood popper, you should ??, I won't stop for these boppers, we roll.

Lane 2 lane in the dropper, stretch Excursions on choppers.
Helicopters with minacas, different boppers who knock us.
Truck poppers, top droppers, we TYP.
What you see, I see the, 1-2-3 do with me.
I creep smoke a tree, TV'S, DVD'S.
Burban' swearvin down da' street, Flex fallin in da ???
From 2PSP, fitin' to wreck the industry.
??? to the T, feel me, who I be?, LIL' JAMES!
Grabin' grain, switchin' lanes down Main.
People complain cause I swang, with screens fallin' like rain.
Slightly cracked trunk open, if I'm choppin' or postin'.
Paint soakin down da' beltway as I tossin' and toakin', coastin'.
Sippin' potion, ain't no braggin' or boastin'.
Dey jokein' while I'm postin' wit' my yacht on da' ocean.
If its hoops or coupes, we let the trunk sake loose.
Hot juice, show proof, and gently raise da' roof.

Swangin lane 2 lane with my hands against da' grain.
Workin' my wood wheel when I swang and bang.
CD's change, &amp; DVD, disks keep on spinning.
Don't make me crank up 300 horses in my engine.
Hit my ignition burning 20 inches dey choppers.
Got da harness on top might be tint, it might be drop top.
Dress dirty, in da' trucks, gatta call my boys.
In da hood doin' 30 or a 108 on da' Autobaun.
And I'm the son of a king with a castle and pond.
Shinin' like da' sun, every mornin' when you young.
Soon to come, I'ma stunt, and I strain, the game is in me.
It's time to play baby, let's put these swangers on da' bently.
Niggas chins get checked, ask Flex we got plex.
From the count of three, let's take these choppers on the lex.
We put blades on trofo-trucks??, cause we off da' chain.
Lane 2 lane against da' grain, Wood, Flex, and Lil' James.

Swangin lane 2 lane in a dropper.
On the count of 3.
Southside roll choppers.
Swangin lane 2 lane in a dropper.
On the count of 3.
Southside roll choppers.
Swangin lane 2 lane in a dropper.
On the count of 3.
Southside roll choppers.
Swangin lane 2 lane in a dropper.
On the count of 3.
Southwest roll choppers.

Hahaha..yeah we roll choppers baby, you know what I'm talking about.
South -W-E-S-T, for L-I-F-E, forever, its goin' down.
