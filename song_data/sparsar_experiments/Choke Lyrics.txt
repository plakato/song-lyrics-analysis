Choke Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


Hand on your shoulder while you're pulling out a gash.

Thought about last summer when the both of us crashed.
Didn't mean to say that because I thought you weren't alive.

I don't mind my feelings I just wish the pain would die.
Blood on the surface when it drops against the glass.

Beauty in tomorrow and a love that couldn't last.
I can't see you when I can't even see me.

All those thoughts I had made it hard for me to breathe.

Love, hurt, 31st.
6 ft in the fucking dirt.
These days don't feel the same.
You loved me, just not that way.
