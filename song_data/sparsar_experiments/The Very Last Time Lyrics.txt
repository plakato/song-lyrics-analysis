The Very Last Time Lyrics
by X Blake Freeman X.

X Blake Freeman X.
When I met you for the first time it was more than somethin'.
A brand new feelin' so that just kept me comin'.
Anywhere I took you it really didn't matter.
The worst places, the best times, and I memorized that pattern.
I drove in a blizzard just to see that face.
With Migos blastin' the whole dang way.
Thinking about you, planning on what to say.
When I finally saw you I couldn't look you in the face.
You know how nervous I get, this isn't a surprise.
I have to look away, that's something you've realized.
If I look at you too long I get distracted by those eyes.
Everything I've said is the truth, I've never told you no lies.

I'm packin' my bags for the very last time.
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide.
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime.
When we finally get together and I can call you mine.
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time.
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide.
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime.
When we finally get together and I can call you mine.

This has happened before, why'd I try it again?
I realized how I lost you, maybe this time I'd win.
Looking at it now I realize none of this is our fault.
I would text you all the time but we're just not allowed to talk.
I would write you some letters or I'd call you all the time.
On the inside I'm broken but play it off like I'm just fine.
'Til my nerves get the best of me and I break down and cry.
Pull down my sailor hat just to cover up and hide.
You held me, I held you, it rained on us outside.
I tell you ''I gotta go'' but I don't call that a goodbye.
I tell you that I love you and to remember this night.
And we'll end up being together and then you started to cry.

I'm packin' my bags for the very last time.
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide.
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime.
When we finally get together and I can call you mine.
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time.
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide.
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime.
When we finally get together and I can call you mine.

Quavo of Migos.
I'm packin' my bags I'm gone.
Ignore all the signs, I'm goin' blind.
Taking you off of my mind.
You did me wrong for the last time.
But I cannot spoil you cause' that's a waste of time.
See you at my show in Atlanta.
Gettin' freaky for the cameras.
She told me her name was Tamra.
Boy, that's an exotic dancer.
My homie told me that they rent her.
Swith em' all like baby Pampers.
I got a new baby, Tampa.

I'm packin' my bags for the very last time.
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide.
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime.
When we finally get together and I can call you mine.
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time.
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide.
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime.
When we finally get together and I can call you mine.

X Blake Freeman X.
For the very last time.
For the very last time.
