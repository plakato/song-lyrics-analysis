Tonight (We Live Forever) Lyrics
by Union J.


Feels like a party every time you come around.
Even though it's just the two of us in my house.
I don't know what you do, but you're making everything feel right.
I may not know much, but this feels like love.

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh.

I knew when I met I was onto something good.
You made me love you like I thought I never could.
I have the best time, every time you're by my side.
Cause we're living for tonight.

Tonight we'll live forever.
Do this we won't remember.
But it's all good, all good.
If we can, we should.
As long as we're together.
It's all good! Ooh oh oh.
It's all good! Ooh oh oh.
It's all good! Ooh oh oh.

You'll take a bad day and you'll make it feel alright.
It might be dark outside, but you'll make my sun shine.
I don't know what you do, but you're making everything feel right.
Cause this feels like love.

As long as we're together.
We're gonna live forever.
Gonna do whatever!
If we stick together, it will be all good.
And if we stick together we can live forever.
We can do whatever.
It will be all good.
