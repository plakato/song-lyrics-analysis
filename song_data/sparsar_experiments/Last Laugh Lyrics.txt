Last Laugh Lyrics
by Tyler Major.


Howdy-- dont glorify this establishment.
Already mind blown, his eyes closed the flows emmaculate.
Certainly the man lacks vocab and subtlty.

He never let the laughing cease.
But didn't hestitate to let them feel the wrath his adam brings.
Slicker than the 7 seas, bury me in the current.
Like a titan ligers,lions tigers bears and sea urchin.
Yes you find it funny, you have a laugh of a _____.
Considered a master and by his allies such a genius.
Deception is false spoken and sworn into the best guys.
Girls of sorts try to mislead them to their oatmeal cream...
Sorry ill have a burger.
And for dessert its never dry id like to try your myrtle.
Yellow tape the premasis nothing to really see here.

Oh no...hes on another clepto.
Askin why his brothers can't attend to bless his next show.
All mens waitin in line for free samples.
Of the best flow..slippery when wet forget the crisco.
Shut it up...no rhymes need clarity.
Clear the dry red eyes of the 5'11 blind guy.
Charish thee. five rules, i choose to lace beats.
Rhyme about myself so you can feel it like your space key.
Afternoon youtube latest vids by adande.
All his beats bare and stripped naked like aguilera would say.
Um.....whose next on melee?
Matter of fact i got street fighter covered on asante.
If theyre turnt up now then when do they go about?
Like closed doors i donate to jehovahs witnessing girl scouts.
5 point 23 maybe you should get faster.
30 metaphors a minute on--all--fours encore ceased laughter.
