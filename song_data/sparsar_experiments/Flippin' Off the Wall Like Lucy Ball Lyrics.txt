Oahhhh I got.. HA HAHAHAH! *uncontrollable laughter*.
Oahhhhhhh, when I was a little baby.
Little baby boy, hooooh!
A little itty bitty baby boy.
I was blessed with soul.. *more laughter as the beat stops*.

This is def, hoooooh!
Mmmmmmmm...
This goes, this goes back.
This takes me back to 1940's, when I was a little baby.
New ? sittin on Kevin Renald's lap.
And he said to me, SON you've got so much soul...
You've.. hooooh you've got, soul comin out your ass *laughter*.
Now peep this, see...
You've gotta take this back down South.
Oh I'm buggin, I'm flippin.
Hahahahaha, huh, flippin right?

Now see you, got to understand where this is comin from.
Little white boy, down South.
No motherfuckin white people around.
And they said to me, they said, White boy! *laughter*.
You've got a whole, mess of soul.
They said, White boy!
You gonna grow up, to have so much soul.
A little little itty bitty baby boy!
Ha hah.. oh shit!

Hohhhhhh, you've got soul.
Way down in your little itty bitty baby toes.
You got soul...
You've got so much soul it's comin out your asshole!
Whohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhle mess of soul.
They said, Kevin! When you grow up.
Gonna work with a lot of white people think they're black!
*laughter*.
They said, Oahhhhhh, Kevin boy!
When you grow up, you gonna go to the big city.
Meet a, man named Peter.
Gonna look like a white boy but he's a def MC.
He got soul.. comin out his asshole!
