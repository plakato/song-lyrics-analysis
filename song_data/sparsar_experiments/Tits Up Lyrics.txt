Tits Up Lyrics
by The Uncluded.

Aesop Rock 
5 day forecast clouds in a piss cup 
Trying to pinpoint when the shit went, tits up, 
, 
Kimya, Dawson, 
Whatcha gon na do to get your ass out of this rut. 
So, you don't live your whole life tits up, 
 
Aesop, Rock 
, 
Precious brothers. Ain'T, a name in lights, 
A last rice, cake, shared under flames and dice 
That know to cope, got ta, swap old, campfire, chillers, 
The kind that only grow in vampire state cellars, 
And climb out of jars when they migrate westward 
Where. They were free of any chessboard square 
Hi. I don't shake beer in the dark, 
I write, but I'm no Shakespeare in the park. 
I'M, a grownsed up punk, with an ear for a heart, and I hear you 
Please wait here for the ark 
Yes sir. Likely to fester inactive unless they address all the death. 
And distraction shake hands with a foxhole raider 
Got, a grip like c-c-c-c-combo breaker 
Tally up the dead folk squashed in a car 
Fire still warm. They couldn't have gone far. 
 
Kimya Dawson 
Packed up tough in your double stuff. Swimtrunks 
Cannonballs recalled when your shit split 
Tits up 
 
Aesop Rock 
New high score on the IHop Dig-Dug 
Pretty cool, otherwise pretty much 
Tits up 
 
Kimya Dawson 
How. Can I save you when I can barely save myself 
Codependent No More on my audiobook shelf 
Cruise to your town in my cape and my unitard 
See, what I can do with my lyrics and my guitar 
Now? I got my sidekick. Who brings the beatdown 
Have you seen the size of his feet: 
Clown shoes with his own name in gold on the side, 
If you're in the dark, we'll bring a little Lite Brite 
Pop in the pegs 
Make cute pictures 
Pick up some merch make us permanent fixtures. 
On, the self-help shelf of your record collection 
So. If shit's tits up, you can make the selection 
That will take you from limp to a little bit. Pumped up 
Our HQ is a gluten free, bun truck 
Shhh, zip your lips 
Don't tell the bad guys 
Shine that giant bun signal in the sky 
Wait a few months for us to arrive. 
Big group hug a little awkward 
Hi 
 
Aesop Rock 
One day you're. In luck, 
One day you're, stealing cigarettes from a flipped truck 
Dick face Tits up 
 
Kimya Dawson 
You feel a little better. When we sign your high tops. 
When you get home, it's the same old tits up 
 
Aesop, Rock 
One, half megafawna, one half mall
rat haul. Ass 
Straight face dove-tailed ball cap 
Grape ape unveil plans for the van use 
Drive to your shit town. Tell you that your band rules 
Live with the get down, maybe out of shampoo 
Radio on scan for a stanza to lampoon 
Under. The bum drum cutter is a real motherfuckers' motherfucker motherfucker
 
Kimya Dawson 
Alex Karras and Conraid Bain
 and Leather Tuscadero, 
And Pinky and the Brain re-
enacting, the Universal masturbation movie, 
Dolph, cold cocks Courtney love
boobies, and that over the shoulder anaconda holder 
You were close to the hole you're. Getting colder 
Bogeyed your birdie when I powdered my putter 
But there, ain't no fluffer that can fluff this nutter 
 
Aesop Rock 
One day you're in love. 
One day your pills suck 
One day, your shits fucked 
Nip tuck tits up 
 
Kimya Dawson 
Snookie in a snuggie at the walt witman pitstop 
Cinnabon, Bon Jovi slippery tits
up, 
 
Aesop Rock 
High noon: milk, duds cherry cola, big gulp, 
Corn, dog, dim sum moon pie; tits Up 
 
Kimya Dawson 
Swab, your six lips with cholorform litmus 
Colorforms horshack Rorschach 
Tits up 
 
Aesop Rock 
Hey Mom life's good works. Great tip tops 
P.S., send cash, half dead, Tits up 
 
Kimya Dawson 
Riding on the back of Undercat Battlepop 
Underoos big sword, top drawers, 
Tits up 
 
Aesop Rock 
Can't plug an old faithful with a fist fuck 
No rain coat no dice 
Go Tits up 
 
Kimya Dawson 
Shine my shoe kicking elevator, missed hugs 
Seventeenth floor; nothing but bugs 
Tits up 
 
Aesop Rock 
Brunch at the strip club corn, beef, crisp ones, 
Four, teeth, pink, tux, pornstache, 
Tits up 
 
Kimya, Dawson, 
Joey, Martin Lawrence â€“ WHOA 
Little, Stevie, King Tut, 
Bad, taste, walkaways, Eternal blame 
Tits up 
 
Aesop Rock 
This'll, be remembered as the year you ruined Christmas 
Figgy pudding everywhere: shitty footing, 
Tits up 
 
Kimya, Dawson 
Willy, Wonka, shooting blanks, 
Tae Bo Banks, catwalk 
Looking glass, 
Flexed, ass, 
Fizzy, lifting tits up 
 
Aesop Rock 
Block block chop block Chop kick kick punch 
Step over the line if you ever feel tits up 
 
Kimya, Dawson, 
Bert, cake, 
Unabomber, 
Eyebrow, 
Shit's, punk, 
Trimmed muff, not so much 
Fluff's, tough 
Tits, up
