Dead Prez Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway.

M-1 
The white man came to Africa with rifles and Bibles 
Heard. The name started changin. The titles 
Now instead of Chaka call me Nat Turner with the burner 
Freedom fighter for this revolution, fuck a wave journer 
See. I be what John Wilkes Booth was to Lincoln blam 
Sirhan Sirhan peepin, through the curtains with my eyes on a Kennedy, 
Dead prez politic know your enemy, keep your toast close 
Because political power come from the barrel of it 
We in a war, nigga leave it or Love it 
Since. They got us in a scope like a P.E. logo, 
I watch for the po-po and train at the dojo 
Not, a gun Deniro, but a working class hero, 
Takin a stand like a panther with an M-1, Guran 
Screamin know your gun laws. Self defense is a must 
When, we set it off, I'm a be the first to bust 
, 
Stic.Man 
Freedom is not having to sell crack to eat. 
Freedom is you can say without the bleep? 
Freedom is power in the hand of the masses. 
Where everybody shares and there are no classes. 
Freedom is hard work. Freedom is ours. If we bomb first 
Freedom is heaven on earth. If you religious religion, is your personal 
Business freedom is our collected political interest. 
Love put in the action of principal roles: 
Freedom is where the people play an active role, 
In the policies, the govern our lives. 
Freedom is equality, fire all black mothers.
