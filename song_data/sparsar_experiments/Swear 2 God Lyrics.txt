Swear 2 God Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


I'ma mob  go hard.
If we need it, I'm on the motherfucking job.
I'ma grind  til we shine.
No lying, I put my life up on the line.
I'm committed  to get it.
And put on for my motherfucking city.
I won't stop  get this guap.
Til me and all of my niggas on top man I swear to God.

No more flipping birds, call them junkies, get the word out.
‘bout to make them haters be silent like the word doubt.
Lord I hope it work out, if this shit don't exercise.
Then it's back to the trap, nigga you ain't never lied.
‘cause have you ever tried sleeping when your guap gone.
Couldn't get through them naps with a hot comb.
Yellow box of cereal the only pops in my home.
And I ain't trying to meet another one nigga I'm grown.
And I'm on, Money Makaz MV-Player.
My team traded Derrick nigga we don't need favors.
And we don't see haters, all we see is the money.
Like created player stats, i'ma keep it 100.

Gotta love it, i'm a product of it, I've been thugging.
Ever since they closed Wadley Middle School.
Nothing new, I been a fool, always went against the rules.
I had intentions to stay out on the corner all night because the rent was due.
Money was the principle, the streets the teacher.
If you out there looking sweet, you better know them beasts will eat ya.
Every night you got them creatures out there on the hunt.
Been at war with the police so we out there on the front.
Niggas out there want to stunt, this ain't no motherfucking fashion show.
Motherfucking lives is on the line so get your cash and go.
Don't know what you asking for, this shit is real.
End up stressing in a cell or you risking getting killed.

Them guys done put my nigga in the big house.
He got no bail and I ain't talking ‘bout the prize.
You add that to the lies, when I'm down, they just Pele me.
But life's a big test so I stood up when they S-A-T.
I guess that shit is just tv when the judge carin'.
So I won't give a fuck when I cop that new Maclaren.
And I ain't Ozzy Osbourne, I ain't fucking sharin'.
And it ain't got no kids but that shit is apparent.
I'ma sit atop the stairs and send a shot to he who steps.
Man I don't give a fuck who right, let's go to war and see who left.
Heavyweight – I got the belt, bitch I'm ‘bout to be the top dog.
And I put that on everything like hot sauce.
