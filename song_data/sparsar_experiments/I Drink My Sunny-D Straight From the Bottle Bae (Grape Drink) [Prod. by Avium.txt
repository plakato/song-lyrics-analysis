by 4AM.


I am Sam.
Sam I am.
That's Sam.
That's Sam I am.
I don't like Sam I am.
Would you like Green Eggs &amp; Ham, because I would not like them here or.
there.
I would not like anywhere.

Got em mourning over the death of that good hip-hop.
With a, sample of Sega, there's no.
time for none of that.
The Park song was the kickoff this is when I run it back.
Waitin' on the release man, fans be getting blue balls for a.
Beat with a speech, screech.
Had to get saved by the bell, cause my faith couldn't teach.
And to think, man, it's been a while since I ate man.
Worked my ass off just to get in shape man.
Figured i'm just another square compared to these.
Yes, yes, Arty's got a c.d, is it that hard to belive.
He's actually good at something, besides a fuckin' fantasy league, yes.
No Death Star story.
Only spit because I know you'll swallow.
So apollo, Rocky reference.
On the road to riches damn I got a parking ticket.
Love the game so much I threw myself at it, four.

Ask me what I do.
I drink it straight.
We do this shit for free fam.
I drink it straight from the bottle bae.
We runaway, fantasies for modern day.
Let's have a toast for the runaway's.
Drinking straight from the bottle.
Sunny-D side a waffles.
And they think it's awful how I had to teach your mother how to swallow.

And she threw herself at me.
Put her in the club all she wanna hear is YG.
Put her in the crib all she wanna hear is YG.
So when she's like, 4AM's her favorite rapper, all i'm like is why me? yea, I.
know.
Stealing lines is Childish, but i'm trying to be Childish.
These weak lines like white girl cocaine, provoking.
I'm that Red 5 rebel, blood vessel.
So boss you'll only see me on the final level.
Just a little word to the wises, gettin' all my wishes.
And all these hoes be dirty guess i'm doin dishes, oh no.
She home alone, i'm like what you got to eat.
Not your pussy, no pun intended.
Give off the wrong impression.
Just want a bowl of corn flakes when it's all finished.
Bring me breakfast, that's my soft spot.
And then the pin dropped.
Cause I said God Complex was soon to drop, 4am.

Not in a house.
Not with a mouse.

Four.
