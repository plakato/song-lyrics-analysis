Motto Freestyle Lyrics
by Quillz.


Ok YOLO/ Tommy Hill, but no POLO/

I'm Fresh as Produce. Let me Cool
it/New Edition LL Bean bookbag
no zipper/, So much loud in the zip, lock that the lock don't zipper/ The Young Jack Skeleton/ Tim Burton of my
lyrics/. My fam' is over there
tripping off trippy that got us sinking into the darkness, like a dungeon/, so I
guess that I play Cee-Lo/ Mob's still Goodie/ Run my team, like I'm Andrew/ Feeling Lucky over here
/. Let'S hit the Casino/ Ya'll
can play Pesci/ I'll play Robert Deniro/ Sharon's Stoned in the corner; pick
her up, so we go home/ Long
nights every night shout out to my girl, Leo/ Mary Jane's by the bundle/ Stacks 3 to be honest/ flossin', like an Orthodontist/ Rest In Peace. To my boy, Adonis/, I'm flyer than Jaromir Jagr/ in that lexus 3: double zeros/, No Tint/. The city already knows who we
are/ 
 
Fresh out of the trenches, like I'm fresh out of the matrix walking on astronomical planes in my Asics 
dump, another natty on face till I'm wasted botanical to the brain got me raised. That'S a facelift/
basic I be in the cut like Luke on Hoth when he sliced open the gut of the
Taun Taun raw snoozing. Next to
the puke, its quite soft secret mole, steal your soul. With the Shang Tsu claw
/ paint stained paws take shots
then. I fall while Delatone with a blonde doll in a bathroom stall/. Type
Cancun heat meets croconaw steam rise enter with these guys pass ball
/ smash rock like a smut fast
cop cheeks man, please crush trees with Greenbean and the team stuss tees, never more just hanes plains. And
Some jeans, ill tommy, hil flannel, with loafers below the knees/ six letter. Steez noir side until I'm so old. Summertime catch
walls chilling out in soho Montana rojo, canvases from Soto on them same as Cotto who be in them rings like Frodo
/ Wilmington, like mordor sauron
hitting. The sirens eye in the sky miss a ninja while he flying drift through the cracks of the
barricades wilding. Now, I'm inside of the scene looking out at you, gaijins.
 Ya'll, already know, though im
yelling out Kobe yolo in the

about the team and it go like E.F.F.G.E.E. and I'm tripping off a bean can't feel a thing noir side
and we lean 
, 
Uh.., Shawty, wan, photo/she, already know. Though/That I get around so that there
is a no no/keep something on deck.. On the D low/fuck a bitch, then fuck, a
bitch.. Yeah, that's my motto/ha
take it for what it is/i be on some shit/
