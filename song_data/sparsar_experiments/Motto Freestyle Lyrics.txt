then I fall, while Delatone with a blonde doll in a bathroom stall/ type.
cancun heat meets croconaw, steam rise enter with these guys pass ball.
/ smash rock, like a smut fast.
cop cheeks, man please, crush trees with Greenbean and the team, stuss tees never more just hanes plains and.
some jeans, ill tommy hil flannel with loafers below the knees/ six letter steez, noir side until I'm so old, summertime catch.
walls chilling out in soho, Montana rojo, canvases from Soto, on them same as Cotto who be in them rings like Frodo.
/ Wilmington like mordor, sauron.
hitting the sirens, eye in the sky miss a ninja while he flying, drift through the cracks of the.
barricades wilding now I'm inside of the scene looking out at you gaijins.
. Ya'll already know though, im.
yelling out Kobe, yolo in the.
