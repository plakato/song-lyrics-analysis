Let Me Blow Your Mind Lyrics
by Twistid Rob.


Cannabis smokin im rollin weed with the killer buds toke it tough, when I hit.
the microphone I tear it up.

Im sick in the game, motherfuckers already know my name.
Twistid Vaurheaz, bringing the pain.

Im choppin the ruckus Im nuttin up, put me in the psycho ward not giving a.
fuck.
Rollin out like cannon yeah you better duck.

Standing there take a bullet to the brain bang bang bang bang bang!
Better be movin out of my syllable range.

function.
Tossin up formulations mind combustion, all of these wannabes I just dont.
trust em.
Too many motherfuckers that think they're sick, so many motherfuckers that rap.
that quick.
Everybody and their mama wanna be a chopper but they cannot do it proper did.
you know that shit?
Im a lyrical beast I got more than a notepad, so many beats I make more than a.
dope track, Homicidal sheets Ima give it a toe tag.

Like settin the rifle under your chin, Blowing out your brains want to do it.
again?
Steppin on my world it's not pretend, I'll be fuckin with your mind like Ive.
always been.
My illatosis come the closest to the dopest killer pulses rolling up my buds,.
bout to smoke this.
Fuckin with my high that's borderline hopeless, I'm hackin your cold you get a.
virus to cope with.
Pragmenation damnin everything you ever had, wiping your hard drive you won't.
remember that.

My intentions are to get you hella mad.
Whatchu gonna do when I blow your mind? Im aiming at your egos prescribin.
rhymes.
Outa the lab with a pen and the pad, the scientist gone mad with the syllable.
lines.
Im killin raps in the studio doing my thang, got my team members eyes in the.
page my gang.
Do or die motherfucker that's the high aim, Twistid Vaurheaz yeah that's my.
name.

Cannabis smokin im rollin weed with the killer buds toke it tough, when I hit.
the microphone I tear it up.

I'm sick in the game, motherfuckers already know my name.
Twistid Vaurheaz, bringing the pain.

I'm choppin the ruckus I'm nuttin up, put me in the psycho ward not giving a.
fuck.
Rollin out like cannon yeah you better duck.

Standing there take a bullet to the brain bang bang bang bang bang!
Better be movin out of my syllable range.

They don't wanna talk with a chopper 'gon have the offer.
I turn em all into pasta and stew em up in the lockers.
Cerebellum turn explosives the motion corrosive posture and open the ruthless.
slaugther.
These 16's 'gon end like con shit.
Stage catchin the caca we blowin their marley powder.
Make sour face outa cowards that are half of a fuckin hour.
Then chop em into my chowder to vow over they think it's power.
More trackers into their tower we're higher than fuckin opera.
But they don't fuck with me guess I'm some sort of entity.
Corpse sittin on stage with flames shock it type energy.
Piranhity gone face and supervillians is skin to me.
They honestly amazed when my brain lookin like Kennedy.
Our blood dripped and my trip and wheelchairs.
Change flicks and gas spits it's real rare.
Stage show on steroids and nightmares.
The whole club's on silence and ice stares.
Brain brain brain brain brain brain brain!
My soul's sick I'm way past the repairs.
Brain brain brain brain brain brain brain!
They talk about the sick in the dark but they seem scared.

Cannabis smokin im rollin weed with the killer buds toke it tough, when I hit.
the microphone I tear it up.

I'm sick in the game, motherfuckers already know my name.
Twistid Vaurheaz, bringing the pain.

I'm choppin the ruckus I'm nuttin up, put me in the psycho ward not giving a.
fuck.
Rollin out like cannon yeah you better duck.

Standing there take a bullet to the brain bang bang bang bang bang!
Better be movin out of my syllable range.
