Apistat Commander Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

Up, along the rocks.
It's good, it's not so hard now.
Up, I bite my tongue, who cares?
This chance to drop off.

All that you left you left for someone.
All of this hurt that's wilted off.
All this relief, it's the oddest thing.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

Chen, he'll never come that's fine.
I lost my thought.
Wei, Huai could talk me down.
Still, still this chance to drop off.
