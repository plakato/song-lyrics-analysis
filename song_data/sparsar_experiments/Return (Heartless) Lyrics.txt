Return (Heartless) Lyrics
by Sworn In.

I've died and I've been dead for some time.
Built my own cage and left here to cry.
Cry for help but nobody can hear.
Fallen on deaf ears.
Withering away with no soul to sell.
I'll burn in hell.
I'll burn in hell.
I'll burn in hell.
This is the end of me.
And all I've fucking learned is.
We are all alone at heart.
And we are meant to be this way from the start.
Well here I am alone at heart.
A man who sold his fucking life to the dark.
