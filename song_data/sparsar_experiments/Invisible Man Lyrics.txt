Invisible Man Lyrics
by The Undead.

You pass me every day.
But you never hear a word I say.
You walk right by the invisible man.
But you never see me cryin'.
No matter how I try, the invisible man.
It's like I don't exist.
You can't fake it cause you know it's true.
I used to be just like you.
Until my people came.
And I became the invisible man.
I used to have a normal brain.
But this would drive anyone insane.
I spit in your face, the invisible man.
Can't you see I'm dying?
It's such a disgrace, the invisible man.
The way that you react.
You can't fake it cause you know it's true.
I used to be just like you.
Until my people came.
And I became the invisible man.
But when you see me coming near.
But when I scream children cower in fear.
It's not my choice, the invisible man.
Evicted from the human race.
You walk right by the invisible man.
Like not a word I say is true.
You can't fake it cause you know it's true.
I used to be just like you.
Until my people came.
And I became the invisible man.
The invisble man.
It could be you.
