Midnight Dancers Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Midnight Dancers.

Here we go again, on the cobble streets of Paris.
We'll go dancing 'round the square and everyone will stop and stare.
At the lovers of the night.
And time has drifted on, but we still do it right, oh.

Oh, isn't it enough now that you know our chance is gone.
To have you for the night - you've had me all along.
Isn't it enough now that you can hardly breathe?
Oh, just stay, just stay the night with me.
Stay the night with me.

Well I danced the floors of a thousand rooms.
And I picked you up and it all felt new.
What you think they're gonna do if we just run.
And broke the rules.
But you will never break them with me.
Yeah, you will never break them with me.

Yeah, isn't it enough now that you know our chance is gone?
To have you for the night - you've had me all along.
Isn't it enough now that you can hardly breathe?
Oh, just stay, just stay the night with me, mm.
Stay the night with me.

I keep trying to move on, there's something in the way.
You've had me so long and it's the way it'll always stay.
I've been trying to move on, there's something in the way, yeah.

Oh, isn't it enough now that you know our chance is gone?
To have you for the night, you've had me all along - all along.
Isn't it enough now that you can hardly breathe - hardly breathe.
Oh, just stay.
Just stay the night with me.
Stay the night with me.

Here we go again...
On the cobble streets of Paris...
We'll go dancing 'round the square...
And everyone will stop and stare...
At the lovers of the night.
