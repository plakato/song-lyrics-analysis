My nigga just paid a visit.
Im on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty.
Ignorant mothafuckas.
Nobody had no jobs and nobody had no babies.

The Friday night games and after that we were blazin.
20 deep at the lunchtable.
My nigga those were the days.
So i guess i miss the days.
Haha.
When we had more time to play.
The most important things were basketball and ladies.
Im on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty.
Im on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty.

My nigga jus paid a visit.
Nostalgia hittin major, at the time nothin could faze us.
A-Z.

Hold up, hold up, my nigga jus showed up.
Boy stopp.
I can't close a dutch no more cause I got too much reefer in it.
Know what? roll up, get that L powed up.
All the hoes say, Uh huh huh.
Hold up, hold up, my nigga jus showed up.
Couldn't stay in my ways.

You family to the end.
Ahhhhhh.
Wait a second, wait a minute.
Man I ain't seen you in while.
P butter jelly lunches.
Wait a second, wait a minute.
My nigga, here go the j like.
I can't close a dutch no more cause i got too much reefer in it.
Freestyling causing ruckus.
Since we was a couple kids rebelious actin wild.
I'm on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty.
All the ladies say, hoooo.
Know what? roll up, get that L poured up.
