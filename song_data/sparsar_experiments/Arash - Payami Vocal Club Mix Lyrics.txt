Arash - Payami Vocal Club Mix Lyrics
by Arash.

Suddenly I'm flying, flying high in the sky.
I can feel that i can catch the moon.
The wind whispers you're gonna be here soon.

Eshghe man, to hamooni ke age baa man bemooni.
To mitooni, to mitooni, mano be aarezoom beresooni.
Ey ghorboone khandidanet, ghorboone raghsidanet.
Na mesle to peyda nemishe, na na na na be khodaa nemishe!

Suddenly I'm flying, flying high in the sky.
I can feel that i can catch the moon.
The wind whispers you're gonna be here soon.
Suddenly I'm dreaming, I'm walking under the sun.
As the morning comes and i wake up.
You are with me and the sun is up.

Mitarsam een dastaat ye kaari bede be dastam!

Ey eshghe man joonam fadaat, bezaar bemoonam baahaat.
Ghorboone range laabaat, beri babaa mimiram baraat!
Az daste man hey dar naro, hey hey invaro oonvar naro.
Baba divoone misham naro, na na na na az pisham naro!

Suddenly I'm flying, flying high in the sky.
I can feel that i can catch the moon.
The wind whispers you're gonna be here soon.
Suddenly I'm dreaming, I'm walking under the sun.
As the morning comes and i wake up.
You are with me and the sun is up.

Suddenly I'm flying, flying high in the sky.
I can feel that i can catch the moon.
The wind whispers you're gonna be here soon.
Suddenly I'm dreaming, I'm walking under the sun.
As the morning comes and i wake up.
You are with me and the sun is up.

Suddenly I'm flying, flying high in the sky.
I can feel that i can catch the moon.
The wind whispers you're gonna be here soon.
Suddenly I'm dreaming, I'm walking under the sun.
As the morning comes and i wake up.
You are with me and the sun is up.

Mitarsam een dastaat ye kaari bede be dastam!
