Cheatin' Woman Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Why did you make me love you sister.
I done everything I can baby.
Cheating woman make you crazy.
When you knew you was untrue.
You won't bother poor me no longer.
Oh woman why you do me.
Then you won't bother poor me.
Yes a dozen to you is too few.
Oh Lord the way you do.
I'm gonna get that pistol gal.
Well I can't stand the pain no more.

Knocking on her front door.
I'm gonna shoot you and all your pals.
Brother there's nothing you can do.
She don't even want poor me.
You won't bother poor me no longer.

I'm gonna shoot you and end your world.
She'll leave your heart so lonely.
You loved every man with pants on.
Cheating woman - going to shoot you.
Cheating woman make you a fool.
Seems like nothing reaches you.
She don't want my love for sure.
You ain't going to bother poor me.
