Emmanuel
by Amy Grant.

We dim the light.
We stoke the fire.
We breathe the evergreen.
Young ones wait.
While the old ones make up.
Tales of how it used to be.

China dolls.
Candy corn.
Painted wooden toys.
Treasures found.
To the wondrous sound.
Of carolling the savior.
Born to us on christmas morn.

Emmanuel, God with us.
Emmanuel!
Emmanuel, God with us.
The son of israel.

And still he calls.
Through the night.
Beyond the days of old.
A voice of peace.
To the weary ones.
Who struggle with the human soul.

All of us.
Travellers.
Through a given time.
Who can know.
What tomorrow holds?
But over the horizon.
Surely you and I will find.

Emmanuel, God with us.
Emmanuel!
Emmanuel, God with us.
The son of israel.

And the years they come.
And the years they go.
Though we may forget somehow.
That the child once born in bethlehem.
Is still among us now.

Emmanuel, God with us,.
Emmanuel!
Emmanuel, God with us,.
The son of israel..
The son of israel.
The son of is...israel..
