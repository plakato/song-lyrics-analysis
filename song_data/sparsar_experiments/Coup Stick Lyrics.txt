Coup Stick Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

Wait for.
Beloved of God.
In Peace.
Enlarges his people.
My father is God.
He breaths the people's cause.
The Healer He is generous.
O the daugheter of god.
The Everlasting one he is praiseworthy.
Intelligent, sheep afraid of my fathers brother.
The lord is judge, God has taken, taken by God.
The time of the lord.
God is exalted.
The fire of God.
God has given.
God is he.
Who god sustains.
He strengthens.
He who god has helped.
God has given.
One whose people are many.
The people will contend.
The people will contend.
God has rememberded retrebution.
Perfect and agreable, agreeable.
The comforter.
My messenger, my star.
O who is like as you are.
Hey dove.
Who delivered salvation.
Who is like as you are.
The comforter.
My messenger the star.
It is the Lord that opens.
Jehovah he is perfect.
He takes posessions.
He that opens.
He that is limiting.
God is my strength.
God has strengthened.
Safely making to forget.
The builder, the hiden one.
The Lord saves who the Lord sustains.
He who Jehovah has set up.
God will fortify his people.
The Lord is Just.
God is great.
