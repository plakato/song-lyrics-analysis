Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Girls they wanna, just wanna have fun.
Girls just wanna have fun.
Girls, they wanna have fun.
Girls just wanna have....

I get home in the morning light.
My mother says what you gonna do with your life?
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones.
Cause, girls they wanna have fun.
Oh girls just wanna have fun.

Girls, just wanna have fun.
Girls, just wanna have....

The phone rings in the middle of the night.
My father says what you gonna do with your life?
Oh daddy dear you know you're still #1.
Cause, girls they wanna have fun.
Oh girls just wanna have fun.

All you really want, just fun.
When the working day is done.
Oh girls they wanna have fun.
Oh girls just wanna have fun.

Girls just wanna have fun.
Girls just wanna have fun.
Girls, they wanna have fun.
Girls, they wanna have....

Some boys take a beautiful girl.
And hide away from the rest of the world.
I wanna be the one that walks in the sun.
Cause, girls they wanna have fun.
Oh girls just wanna have fun.

It's all you really want, just fun.
When the working day is done.
Oh girls they wanna have fun.
Oh girls just wanna have fun.

Girls just wanna have fun.
Girls just wanna have fun.
Girls just wanna have fun.
Girls just wanna have....
