Anytime  Anywhere Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.

My point of view is expanding everyday.
And I feel with clarity my vision sway.
Your private access takes me all the way.

I am amplified by what's inside of you.
I feel your energy is something I can't loose.
I'm a pressure cooker, I'm about to blow.

I love the way that you move me.
It's never enough, I've got to have you.
Anytime/anywhere that's all.

My sweet addiction I pray will never end.
Well-trained and suffering my heat for you.
Depends on love, like the flood.
When I go down.

I love the way that you move me.
It's never enough, I've got to have you.
Anytime/anywhere that's all.

Anytime/anywhere.
I've got to have you.
I've got to have you.
