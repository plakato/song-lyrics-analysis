Dirty Work Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

Well I'd like to see the likes of me relax with a wife and seed.
Time to write and read.
No fight to get a bite to eat.
It might just be a pipe dream but fuck the alternative.
Turning the lights green on the destruction of the Earth.
It's just obvious to me that the way that we do it's wrong.
And I'm not just gonna be the type that prays and moves along.
When these days we lose are gone, and we need every moment.
The maze is too long to proceed that slow and.
When the pain stops I'll crawl up out of bed.
But these raindrops are falling on my head.
My brain stopped recalling what I read.
Back in school cause I train not to swallow what I'm fed.
So for the time being I'm seeing things a little differently.
Bringing out the kid in me as I sing and shout a symphony.
And think about the shit that we confuse and take for granted.
Cause we're losing sacred land as we abuse and rape this planet.

Get our hands dirty working for the things we need.
Scritch scratch to eat and the air that I breathe.
Leave the rest alone and rest time at home.
A congested mess of those obsessed with what they own.

As a free-thinking man.
I'm proud of who I am.
We're deep in sinking sand.
And not allowed to give a damn.
But with this vivid plan I'll visit lands.
I'm sick of name brands.
Made cynics out of fans.
To limit what we understand.
But in this village of the damned.
It seems a long ways away.
Another day gone astray.
One more song that gets no play.
The old say it's the youth, but the youth say it's the old.
The truth is rarely told, unaware we're out of control.
Tryin' to hold ourselves together, but all of it tempts me.
The heart and the soul and the wallet running empty.
From MTV to the pages of the source.
We pay homage to the hordes that line the shelves of record stores.
What's it all for?
I often ask myself.
Should I get off my ass and be like everybody else?
Maybe seek some help.
Or live in rhythm of health.
For an instant found wealth.
But no resistance is felt.

Well I see barstool prophets and philosopher kings.
I hear manic street preachers speak of God and our sins.
We gotta begin.
To see that God is within.

Do you wish to be free, or be habitually sleeping?
Are we histories sheep, or will we live to see freedom?
Cause we been lied to all of our lives.
And I don't think I can take anymore.
F*ck TV, high school, and all of your lies.
I can see right through your face to the core.
So don't even try to tell me what to say.
I'll make you scream and cry when you take my love away.
Day in and day through.
I may win and may lose.
But if all else fails I'll just sing and play blues.
Hey you, what's your name? Make your hand into a fist.
We haven't changed the world but we can if you resist.
