On the run - vip mix Lyrics
by The Qemists.

They know its my destination
Cross the line and I'm lost forever more
Keep lookin' over my shoulder
If i'm caught its the end of it. Its the end of it
I'm on the run 
Run run x16
Need a ride to the boarder baby
The feeling's. Sending me under
I wan na cool down, find somewhere shady
Until. This thing has blown over 
I'm on the run, 
Destination x21
Its the end of it x8
Its the x12
Its, the end of it
I'm on the run 
Need a ride to the boarder baby
The feeling's. Sending me under
I wan na cool down, find somewhere shady 
Until. This thing has blown over 
I'm on the run.
