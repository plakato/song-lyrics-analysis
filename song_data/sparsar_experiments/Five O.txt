Here they come, here they come.
Five O, Five O, there they go, there they go.
Here they come, here they come.
Here they come, here they come.
Here they come, here they come.
Bad Boys want it so, gotta go, gotta go.

Ooohweee, Five O on the creep.
Raise the 6-4 off the concrete.
Move quick, Bad Boys in hot pursuit.
Cos they think I got the loot.
But, they got to catch my ChevroLET.
I-M-P-A-L-A.
OK, it gon' happen do'.
Cos the gas man's passed the flow.
Y'know, the part of the night at Illusions.
Wit brainless seclusion.
Uhh, if ya plan on jammin, then.
My 6-4 best to keep scrammin.
So hold on cos I'm dippin thru the alleyways.
Roll down the window, po' out the Alize.
Cos if we get a D-U-I.
Then your ol' boys will go pop.
Cos here they come.

Here they come, here they come.
Here they come, here they come.
Here they come, here they come.
Five O, Five O, there they go, there they go.
Here they come, here they come.
Here they come, here they come.
Here they come, here they come.
Bad Boys want it so, gotta go, gotta go.

Bad Boys, Bad Boys, what'cha gon' do?
You gotta catch me and my crew.
But, if ya wanna see me in the back seat.
Huh, ya gotta win this track meet.
Uh, now to win first place, be in good shape.
And, prepare for a good chase.
Cos I'm jumpin over gates and on top of Corvettes.
Like Tony Dorsett.
And I bet that 'cha can't catch me though.
Cos donuts make you run slow, y'know.
But you have a good chance, if.
You take off the light blue pants, and.
Call your boys on the CB, uhh.
And tell em if they see me.
To rope me down and hold me down.
But first you gotta slow me down.
Cos here they COME!

Wit our nukes, in the rearview.

Put that thing to the blow, yo.
We gotta go, we gotta go ,and.
Don't stop for one red light.
Til them boys' outta sight, aight.
Makin sure them po-po's.
Say all they saw was a LS and mo' and mo'.
Cos before we catch a case.
We gotta throw dust in they face.

Ain't no thang for the love for the jerk.
And let's put these po-po's to work, uhh.
