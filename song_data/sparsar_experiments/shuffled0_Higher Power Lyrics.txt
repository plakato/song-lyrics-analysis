Higher Power Lyrics
by Boston.

Hey, my higher power.
Tell my story, let me face another day.
My captain's on his way.
Hey, my higher power.
Yeah, my higher power.
Let me love you.
It's the beginning of another day.


Yeah, give me the power.
Yeah, give me the power It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
Hey, my higher power.

The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.
Yeah, give me the power.

The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.
It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.

God, grant me the courage to accept the things.
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.

Ooh, let me love you.
Turn the pages.
Let me hold you.
Yeah, my Higher Power.
Yeah!!
Yeah, give me the power.

It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
Safe embraces, I feel it comin' now.
Yeah, my Higher Power.
Take me home to your religion for the night.
Take me back into the secrets of my mind.
Let me know you.
And the power to change the things I can.

Ooh, let me love you.

Hey, my higher power.

I cannot change.
It's the beginnin', the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.



And the wisdom to know the difference.
Hey, my higher power.
Don't let me cross the line.

Hey, my Higher Power.
Hey, my higher power.
Come and save me Lord.
Teach me how to see your vision through my eyes.
Hey, my Higher Power.
The world is spinnin', but I'm not afraid.
Let me touch you.
