Arms of Love (2010 version) Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Lord, I'm really glad you're here.
I hope you feel the same when you see all my fear.
And how I fail.
I fall sometimes.
It's hard to walk in shifting sand.
I miss the rock and find, have nowhere left to stand.
I start to cry.

Lord, please help me raise my hands so you can pick me up.
Hold me close.
Hold me tighter.

I have found a place where I can hide.
It's safe inside.
Your arms of love.
Like a child who's helped throughout a storm.
You keep me warm.
In your arms of love.

Storms will come and storms will go.
Wonder just how many storms it takes until.
I finally know.
You're here always.
Even when my skies are far from gray.
I can stay.
Teach me to stay there.

In the place I've found where I can hide.
It's safe inside.
Your arms of love.
Like a child who's helped throughout a storm.
You keep me warm.
In your arms of love.
