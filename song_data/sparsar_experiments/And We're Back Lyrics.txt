And We're Back Lyrics
by Sweats..


Welcome.

These niggas seeming ass, and me? I'm just thinking fast.
And X-ing bitches' boxes while I'm putting niggas' dreams in casts.
And my niggas is dreaming cash and play at every station.
Me and you: two I's, making a We, but I ain't fucking playin'.
No sentiment, your raps.
collecting sediment.
And sweats is only letterin' so po-po have some evidence.
A motherfucking fresh-a-man spitting like I'm a Letterman veteran.
Fucking hellish-bent on seeing niggas Heaven-sent.
Since 8 I've been wanting these dreams.
Before I'm fucking 24, so I've been writing 16s.
Or even 32s, if it's that or half, I'll still murder you.
Girls saying Sweats I've heard of you. I'm tryna make a dirty two.
..
Tired of lunchables thinking they fucking run the show.
I'll shit on your Huxtable and your Mitch &amp; Ness adjustable.
Coming proper to knock you right off your rocker.
I'm bending flows and kickin' it like Sokka playing soccer.
