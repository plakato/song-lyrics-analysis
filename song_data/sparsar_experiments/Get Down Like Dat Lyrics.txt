Get Down Like Dat Lyrics
by 702.

Get down.

Hey-hey.
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

This how we get down.

New in the neighborhood.
Looking good to me.
She's by your side,I can't deny.
Got to know your name.
You turn around,you see me now.
I think it's love I've found.
My friends think I'm crazy.
But I don't care cause baby I get down.

I get down like dat.
Be like dat.
I won't fret.
She's no threat to me.

Can I be like dat.
It's on like dat.
I won't get ya.
If I like what I see,yeah.
Da-da-da-da hey hey.

Your own my mind.
I think your fine but your with her.

Can't let you get away.
I want you just because.

It's too late and you know it.
Cause I got you in a daze.

Tell me am I wrong.
To go for what I like.
When she holds you tight.
You want me,it's only right.
And I don't care.
Her name is not step to you.
That means she don't own you.
I'm gonna make you mine.
