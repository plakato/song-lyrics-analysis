Heavy Weight Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


I was standing on the edge of the mountain.
Thinking about yesterday.
I recognised what you said.
I think I heard you say.
I saw you flying.
So high in the sky.

I need to contemplate.
Woah, heavy weight.
Woah, heavy weight.
Woah, heavy weight.
Woah, heavy weight.

I was standing on the edge of the mountain.
Thinking about yesterday.
I thought I heard somebody saying.
Just what you said.
I saw you flying.
So high in the sky.

Woah, heavy weight.
