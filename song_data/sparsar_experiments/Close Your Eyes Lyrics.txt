Close Your Eyes Lyrics
by Unheilig.

I softly touch your silken hair 
My hand is cool you're, unaware, 
You, feel the force move deep under your skin 
 
Clsoe your eyes, 
And. Let your light shine on me, 
Don't, be afraid. 
I'Ll show you a place. You'Ve never seen 
Saying goodbye to the world. 
The house of love, burning down, 
 
I touch your old grey hair. 
You hear me voice everywhere. 
I'Ve lost my way in time. Once again, 
No-one's prepared for this 
The final magical, kiss 
The liberty. You can't resist you're, free 
 
And, I say close your eyes 
And. Let your light shine on me, 
Don't, be afraid. 
I'Ll show you a place. You'Ve never seen 
Saying goodbye to the world. 
The house of love, burning down, 
 
I'm the door for you to heaven, 
I'm your window over hell, 
No remission for your sin, 
 
And, I say close your eyes 
And. Let your light shine on me, 
Don't, be afraid. 
I'Ll show you a place. You'Ve never seen. 
Saying goodbye to the world 
The house of love, burning, down
