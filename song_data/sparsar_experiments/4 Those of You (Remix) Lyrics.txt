4 Those of You (Remix) Lyrics
by Twiztid.


I... h-h-hate... everyone.
I hate everyone.
I... h-h-h-hate... h-hate... everyone.
I hate everyone.
I, I-I, I-I... h-h-h-hate. Hate.

Monoxide.
Ya hear that?

Jamie Madrox.
I hate everyone.

We off the train tracks homeboy, we outta control.
Me and Madrox rockin' bitch, slappin' the world.
I say some shit to make ya toes curl quick, little bitch.
Paint a picture like Picasso from your blood when it drip.
Take a sip, it makes me stronger than the strongest man.
And my mind takes a journey to the farthest land.
I'm the whole world's kryptonite,.
I got these bitches on they knees.
Kissin' hands, cryin', beggin' for they life.
I'm a butcher knife to the neck, gotta go, what.
One, you just a ho, right, two, you ain't a Juggalo, believe that.
Broads you watch your mouth and represent, you get your head split.
Quick, some shit they can't stitch.
I'm a scrub for life, don't let the hairstyle throw it.
With a bag of weed, looking to blow it.
Those who don't know it, I'm Monoxide, blaze up a smoke.
And pass that shit to your boy and give his bitch a choke, biatch.

For those of you that don't know, it's Mr. Madrox, yeah.
First name Jamie, can't nobody see me.
And my brother M-O-N-O on the M-I-C and basically.
My little brother Blaze put it down with thug mentality, that's right.
We represent the vicinity of the East, eastside.
Bustin' free, no love for hoes or the police, biatch.
What you thought it was?
Bumpin' weak shit, need to get some Hatchet in your life cause.
Perpatratin' like we don't know.
Yesterday you was a hater but today you's a Juggalo, bitch.
You just a wolf wearin' sheep nanny coats.
Tryin' to fall up in the flock with the same hokey-doke.
I turn you into smoke, breathe it in, second hand.
Soundscan underground, just lost a hundred grand.
So fuck a fan base, yeah, show me family faces, yeah.
No matter they size, shape, or races.

First off, here we go, whoever trippin' get the sawed off.
Point it to the back of your head, actin' like the dead.
Don't play, twelve shells a day.
Still put it down for my G's around the way, HEY.. HEY.
Ain't nobody tryin' to step to.
Better watch your mouth homeboy I'll powerplex you.
Into the mat, now picture that.
Your style so skinny, your nose is hella hella fat, fat.
Fat enough to kick it.
With a gang of hood rats in the back of a chicken shack.
We react to your jaw like a side effect.
And fuck you hood rat hoes in the projects.
Got a twelve gauge and I'm holdin' it down.
Who wanna ride with me cause I'm headed eastward bound.
For the T-W-I-Z, T-I-D.
B-L-A-Z-E and we ride till infinity, yeah.

For those of you that don't know.
Never blow hydro.
Are you afraid to go where I go?
Even though.
Call yourself a Juggalo.
Tellin' everybody that you're down.
X2.
