Can't Win Lyrics
by Pup.

I'Ve been blessed with shit, luck
There are some things: that'll, never change
I, get STRUNG OUT and FED UP with the strain
Get. A little more nervous, everyday

I, JUST WAN NA BE SOMETHING
NEVER THOUGHT I'D, BE NOTHING AT ALL

AND. It FEELS LIKE I CA, N'T WIN
I'm growing up and I'm giving in
And it's starting to hurt
AND. It FEELS LIKE I CA. N'T WIN
I couldn't wait to be alone, again
And, I'm getting worse

Say. I NEVER TRY, but you know I do
I couldn't live with my 9 to 5
And. I'Ll regret what I did to you my whole life
No matter. What I do
I can never get anything RIGHT

I, JUST WAN NA BE SOMETHING
NEVER THOUGHT I'D, BE NOTHING AT ALL

AND. It FEELS LIKE I CA, N'T WIN
I'm growing up and I'm giving in
And it's starting to hurt
AND. It FEELS LIKE I CA, N'T WIN
I couldn't wait to be alone. Again
And, I'm getting worse

I MIGHT DIE OF THIS BOREDOM
If. You don't kill me first
Chalk it up to apathy
I. Had every chance
I had every opportunity
That I could want
And, I ruined them. All
I had every chance
Never thought I'd be
NOTHING AT ALL

AND. It FEELS LIKE I CA, N'T WIN
I'm growing up and I'm giving in
And it's starting to hurt
AND. It FEELS LIKE I CA. N'T WIN
I couldn't wait to be alone. Again
And, I'm getting worse

I might die of this boredom
If. You don't kill me first
