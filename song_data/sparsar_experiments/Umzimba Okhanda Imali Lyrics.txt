Umzimba Okhanda Imali Lyrics
by PureMatics.


Umzimba okhanda imali
ISkhokho sako ntuthu
Ziya, thunqa
Lenguqu, ngiyayi hlinza
The same friends who jumped ship
Before the ship was in ship shape
Condition
Are asking for
Personally signed Purematics copies

Pure kept his head down
Hustled the microphone
Got SIA credited
Now, with my new found freedom
I capitalise on every moment

Hull. City
The landscape is awesome

Black once said
If. It'S not about the money
What's, the reason for the chatter
SUVs and helicopters. We charter

My brother from another mother
I keep my family and friends
Closer than my enemies
Dwell in the belly
Of, the beast

Ngingumzimba okhanda imali
Umzimba okhanda imali
Ngingumzimba okhanda imali
Umzimba, okhanda imali

As. I Dwell in the belly
Of the beast
Turning into a beast
The minute. We hear
The beats from the east

Kenya rocks the east
Malawi and Zambia
AfroDance wayawaya
Botswana haki rata
Nkatsula

Ngingum zimba
Okhanda imali
From BF to California
Soweto to Rivonia
Ngingum zimba
Okhanda imali ngempela

Namhlanje Yonke inkulumo izophela
Sidlala isipantsula
Double, the rap
Nge scientific spatula
Ngihaqaza, okwe
Tarantula
Sidla ama Rand
Lama Pula

Round table gathering
Lama. Kula
Sikwenza kalula
Ngesicamtho
Bayagalula

Hlala phansi
Thula thula sizwe
Ungazo khala
UJehova wakho
Uzoku, xolela
Inhliziyo
Izozi pholela
Makhox and Headnotes
Purematics

Bazozi tshekela
Inkani izophela
Okwe nkewu. Siyaqhula
Okwama bele inala
Inqwaba, nqwaba, yemali
Lezitha, siya, bhula
Qubula, qubula., Dubula
Skhokho, sikhanda, imali
Umtshina, okhanda, imali

Ngingumzimba, okhanda, imali
Umzimba, okhanda, imali
Ngingumzimba, okhanda, imali
Umzimba, okhanda imali

Purematics

Working, with no sleep
Cos sleep is the next
Best thing to death
Deadly lyricism

Any day or season
And. That is the reason
Why ngingum zimba
Okhanda imali
Purematics salute

Got. To Get up to get down. Mzala
Mr neighborhood chatter box
Ubumbulu, I Shatter
M a proper nutter

On roll like butter
Better slip, slide bitter hitter
Raising, an army sinorita
I beat ya
I, come down, the mountain
And beat ya homee

Creeps and bloods
Alexandra to Luveve
Ngile veve
Qaga
Inqhobe ngezakho
Isicamtho ngesakho, Mbo
Ngesakho Mbo
