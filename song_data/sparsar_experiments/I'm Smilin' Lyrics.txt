I'm Smilin' Lyrics
by VonBock.


Me, I'm Smilin' 
You dont needa see the gold teeth. 
Im wild'n' 
Stupid, dumb swagger make em O.D 
I'm Stylin' 
Newest clothes get em right up off. They feet, 
I'm, Blindin' 
Cuz. Every eye is gon na see me 
 
I'm betting. Every single one of my chips, 
I'll be up in the ritz, the fridge 
Rubbing, the lips of the neighbourhood chic 
And. She tellin' me boy that you gifted 
 
Run the jokes playing simple 
Catching. All of you eyes, right 
But. What I be preaching is teaching is something 
That has nothing to do with that eyesight 
 
So, I'm faceless to my iPhone 
, No dial tone 
Then, just pass it out to my wide zone. 
Make it every month, a new iPhone 
 
Making moves through the metros 
Pass the plates call them. The rentals 
Trips up state, see the kinfo 
Right back down. You can see my dimples 
 
Refrain 
Been running with the older as they love to sip that codine 
Poker playing money better. Keep that paper folding 
Living in the sin. I know that God is gon na scold, 
But, money and fame is what the people went and told me. 
 
Aye talking to chiefs holding a piece 
Pipping the puffs as I put up my feet: 
You fucking with geeks I'm rolling in sheets 
With, multiple freaks that remember my speech. 
 
They, preaching the sermon, the love that I'm German 
And swagger is always on OD 
That's. Four pills got a bag of chills, 
And a couple more of them OC's, 
, 
My, eyes low in that ride, low 
Got, tent up cos. My hydro 
Never been a fan of that drive, slow 
Steady checking mirrors for 5-O 
 
We roll around in that car. Deep 
It's like eight feet, but that micro, 
Your clique, small tryna, hustle, big 
But suck ass, like lipo 
, 
Refrain, 
,
