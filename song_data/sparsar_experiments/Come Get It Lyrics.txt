Come Get It Lyrics
by Yummy Bingham.

Uh uh uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh uh-uh, 
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, 
 
Boy. Do you know 
What you're, really asking me for 
If, you don't 
Then. You need to make sure 
 
You really know what you want. 
 
Cause. I got somethin for ya 
That'll blow ya, mind 
 
Make you wan na go back in time. 
And fill me up, 
 
Getcha higher than that twenty-twen-twen yeah 
 
I got enough goods to feed the whole world. 
I got more riches than diamonds and pearls 
So. For me to get witcha 
You need to come, get it 
Come, get it baby. 
 
I got that shit. Everybody wan na hit 
But what I got 
Not. Just anybody can get 
If you wan na feel the real 
You need to come, get it 
Come, get it baby. 
 
I got the truth. 
Taste my pudding, 
And you'll find the proof 
 
It's more for me cause I get to choose 
Who. I wan na give some of that mmh to 
And it tastes as good as it looks. 
 
You can market in the burbs 
Or in any hood 
Give you that glow, like you from Hollywood 
So. If you want it 
Take it now 
Don't be wishin'. You could of later 
 
I ain't got no need to front 
I know what I want 
And, I'm comin' to get it 
Yummy, don't even stunt 
 
When! You hear that European horn 
Go to the front 
It's me blowin that black thing 
Blowing a blunt 
And. I ain't just anybody 
I'm somebody 
 
And, I don't be at all of'em ma 
Just. Some parties 
So, that train of, though that you got 
Get rid of it. 
Cause me hitting it is some: what of a privilege, 
 
And, that ain't real beef 
I'm in that's frivolous 
Not from DC 
But I'll, show you what a Wizard is 
 
Talking like you got something wet 
Action is louder than words 
And. I ain't felt nothing yet. 
The hugging and the kissing is cool, 
But, honestly 
I'm bout ready to take a dip in the pool. 
 
You done. Did it 
Put your money where your mouth is 
And come wit, it 
And I'ma come get it .
