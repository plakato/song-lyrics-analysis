Daze Lyrics
by Running Legion.


Outside, middle of the night, lights blinding.
Cops running after me, Ziploc bag shining.
No finder's fee, this ain't yours vexed trick, we save it for the next and.
shit.
Almost outta dodge with Plexus, shit.
Hop in a Dodge, Shrine drives away.
Lay low in the trunk, calling in mayday.
Slow flow down, motherfucker it's payday!
Isn't that great? You know it, we got away, say.
When we get home and write it's the best kept secret.
Blast out loud with loud, speakers and shit.
Keynote, we note that we lost em.
They're probably phoning base like I think we lost em!
High-fiving and jiving, we get jiggy in the back.
Dancing around, we ain't even got maps, ain't even strapped.
Keep it all on the d-low.
For now, we go in remembrance of Steelo.
He knows.

It's early.
In the morning today.
Keeping it real.
In every way.
Not quite sure.
What I got to say.
I'm just glad to be here, ok?

I'm always the first in the place, a disgrace.
She mace me in the face if I ever touch her place.
Sounds childish at first but it hurts to get defaced.
To your dismay I'm always to remain crazed.
Like the women after me, ew limp dick.
Like Durst from that one Limp Bizkit.
Like I'm cursed to always be a sick kid.
With mixed dibs on my many different fixed cribs.
Yeah I got places to go, people to impersonate.
Plays to withdraw, in your bush I defecate.
Catching my breath, hold up wait.
When I drop my new tape it's gonna be a wack rap D-Day.
Told you I'd go hard no matter the circumstance.
Know it's my time when yo bitch give a certain glance.
Purse is snatched, time for me to withdrawal.
Taking her drawers without starting a brawl.

Yes, I'm alway going to be known as the catalyst, with a tattered wrist.
A saddled masochist.
You always hear about the monkey's paw but never the cattle's fist.
