Bonfire Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung Peen & The Sacc.


Yea.
Spittin on this beat but I'm not Donald Glover.
When I fuck that ho you know that I won't use a glove on her.
Livin in a mansion but no I'm not your governor.
Someone get this party started, we gon need a hunnit more.
Bottles for these bitches with their shirts off, titties out.
Ask if her if she's DTF you know she is without a doubt.
Me and Yung Peen switchin flows like a current.
Get on our level think you can I bet you couldn't.
Why you look surprised.
It's not the first time I been between your mom's thighs.
Got so much swag, blind people recognize.
Its me.
The Sacc.
Cunt.

Call me Yung Peen.
Got me on the team cause I'm the first pick to give your moms morning sick.

Daughters is gettin fucked in their mouths while I'm at the party sortin sea.
cows.
Got these bitches on my D now, uh.
I bet you feelin fussy.
Cause I went to dinner at your house, shot your dad, called your mom a fuckin.
hussy.
Bitch no caution.
Don't tell your parents I'm givin abortions from suckin on that pussy.
Shootin people for no reason, burnin down abandoned buildings.
Stacked mile high with preschools and desert eagles.
And we sell drugs.
And fuckin kill thugs.
Shoot em in their eyes, in their cocks, while their kids watch.

Drop it to the floor bitch, before I pull my knife out.
Then take off your pants cause I just ordered take out.
Now come here over my way, don't be scared just take it out.
I promise that you won't be pregnant baby, I'll take it out.
Then I'll fuck your brains out.
Or just be fuckin with your brain.
I've got some fuckin gross as thoughts.
Call me Jigsaw I'm insane.
Pray to Jesus, Notre Dame.
Is he magic, David Blaine.
Have you disappearin like the mother fuckin ace of spades.
Am I swaggin, always.
Killin niggas, all days.
I got my hood up, KKK.
Look at me the wrong way and it'll be your last day.
Cause I'll kill you.
