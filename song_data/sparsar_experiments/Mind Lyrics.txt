Mind Lyrics
by Ruse.

A mind made to make minds amazed.
The mind of mine. My mind's a maze.
I find my way with each page.
Each line of mine. My mind strays.
When I rhyme. Time...fades.
Takes faith to fly into the gates of a mind.
Faith combined with patience, takes time.
It takes time for greatness. Great, I'm.
Impatient. Basically, I hate wasted time.
Creates a waste of mind.
My mind's racin, never complacent with a pace or placement.
I'm placed in. Strange and I'm achin to make a statement.
I'll make it. Prayin that the wait ain't weighted.
To wake to the rewards of amazement.
But if I'm chasin payments, I'm chasin pavements.
Pavin my way a claimant, a mental escapement.
A musical engagement, one of a kind.
Beautiful statements from a wonderful mind.
Sittin in a basement where the sun don't shine.
I'm an A-hole in case you're wonderin why I'm.
In a hole.Yup, a son of an . I ain't trying.
To waste your dang time with curse words or raced rhymes.
My aim's to unbind brains and elate minds.
It takes time and faith, fate's fines.
I'll find patience in my mind made to amaze minds. Time.
