Avalanche Lyrics
by The Wombats.

I can see an avalanche rushing towards me, 
Something's, making that snow look so inviting 
I can see an avalanche. Rushing towards me. 
I miss the safety of home, but perhaps this is what I need 
Perhaps. This is what I need 
From all the laugh and scratch bars that de-value our cards with a smile 
From all the a-listed stars that crush our weak hearts with their style. 
We'Re young, we're free, we're ultimately in denial. 
That we'll never get the flash car that does. Forty gallons to the mile 
What's left to lose 
Were you, the search or rescue 
I, can see an avalanche rushing towards me. 
Something'S, making that snow look so inviting 
I can see an avalanche. Rushing towards me. 
I miss the safety of home, but perhaps this is what I need 
Perhaps. This is what I need 
From all the footballers' wives that provide only sighs and a view. 
From all the cringe-worthy nights, where we break down and cry for the rue 
We're young, we're free, we're ultimately out our minds. 
That we never get what we want without hard work and big compromise, 
I'm, not bitter all the time 
I don't punch at airbags when there's nothing left to fight 
- 
I can see an avalanche. Rushing towards me. 
I can see an avalanche rushing towards me. 
Look at that snow. Are you seeing what I see 
I can see an avalanche. Rushing towards me, 
Rushing towards me. 
I can see an avalanche rushing towards me, 
Something's, making that snow look so inviting 
I can see an avalanche. Rushing towards me 
I miss the safety of home, but perhaps this is what I need 
Perhaps. This is what I need
