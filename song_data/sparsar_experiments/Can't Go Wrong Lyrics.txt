Can't Go Wrong Lyrics
by Rumor.


Yeah!
Hash-tag triple F, you know the.
business.

Elohim, that's whom I live for.
He taught me everything I know on this score.
To be more the exception is better than the norm.
Never in a recession I'm always looking forward.
You tryna ascertain why they want an encore.
I don't just entertain I give em something more.
Already king what I need a crown for.
You'll see me reign you'll see my downpour.
So you can watch throne but it's mine for the taking.
Women kids and grown butt men are all debating.
Look where you came from right out of the basement.
Now we're trading places like a real estate agent.
Yeah, I'm here.
Because I didn't wallow in despair.
I just learned to make a throne out of a chair.
And thanks to you who supported my career.

I've been riding on this lonely road.
Hustling is all I know.
Now here I am, I can't go wrong.
Never slowing down just so you know.
I'm very sure.
Yes I can, I can't go wrong.
Go wrong.
Go wrong.
Go wrong.

I tell'em, kick back relax and unwind.
And watch me build a whole lifetime off one rhyme.
I thought I already told these guys it's my time.
They better put they're hands together like nine-forty-five.
Six-thirty, three-fifteen or twelve o'clock.
Should I explain any further or have you already clocked?
Now do you still wanna sleep on me like triple Z.
Well go ahead cos if you don't how else would you see.
That I'm the dream, is there a need for me.
To spell it out before you see that I am the.
The one saviour of hip-H O Pee.
Though I owe every rhyme to almighty G O Dee.
Look, we couldn't have made it this far if it wasn't by His will.
We'll probably crash the car if He didn't have the wheel.
He also told me that this was our year.
Rumor and I, I guess that's why I'm here.

It ain't always been as easy as it might seem.
But the Son is in me that's why I beam.
Take my thoughts and feelings, put'em in writing.
I do this in my sleep I guess I'm living my dream.
Life's good, yeah it's so much fun.
Touring all around the world and back to where we from.
Where they beat the talking drums, where they beat the fontomfroms.
Bringing the whole crew to show you how it's done.
Skillions yeah that's right, that's my fam.
And they know who we are from Accra to Japan.
There were times when things didn't go like they supposed to.
But exercise patience man I let her use some yoga.
And I listened when they told me what I can't do.
Said rumor you're an outcast with all the odds against you.
How you gonna make it when you don't have a dance tune.
Well I give consequence to what they deem inconsequential.
