Globe Robbers

I swear, I love her like a summer breeze 
Search, the hunger. I chased you for a hundred weeks, 
We share, treats, was intrigued to even go get cheated. 
But You, my Bella, are the reason I believe it 
Love. We don't need it. We dream of achieving 
Something. So beautiful in our eyes, 
It is usually a blues for the money 
Used to be funny when the federales roll up 
Remember. When you shot that head and almost made me throw up 
Know what This whole situtation is similiar 
A couple robbing the bank finger prints, familiar 
In, the interior, Yelling
