Ain't It Fun Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.


I don't mind, no.
Letting you down easy but just give it time.
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while.
You're not the big fish in the pond no more.
You are what they're feeding on.

So what are you gonna do.
When the world don't orbit around you?
What are you gonna do.
When nobody wants to fool with you?

Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world.
Ain't it good?
Being all alone.

Where you're from.
You might be the one who's running things.
Well you could ring anybody's bell and get want you want.
You see it's easy to ignore trouble.
When you're living in a bubble.

So what are you gonna do.
When the world don't orbit around you?
And what are you gonna do.
When nobody wants to fool with you?

Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world.
Ain't it good?
Being all alone.

Ain't it good to be on your own.
Ain't it good to go on your own.
Yeah.
Ain't it fun, living in the real world.

Ad Lib.
Don't go crying to your mama.
Cause you're on your own in the real world.
Don't go crying to your mama.
Cause you're on your own in the real world.
Don't go crying to your mama.
Cause you're on your own in the real world.
Don't go crying to your mama.
Cause you're on your own in the real world.

Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?
Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?

Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world.
Ain't it good?
Being all alone.

Ain't it good being all alone.
Ain't it good to be on your own.
Ain't it fun living in the real world.
