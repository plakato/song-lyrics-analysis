Let Me Know Lyrics
by Rumor.


Ahhh! You should let me know baby.
Coz you dey make I go crazy.
Yay ye yeah!

Yes! That's my baby there she goes.
If you must know she's the one that I hustle for.
I hold her close and tell her how much I love her.
Whenever we are together that's how it's supposed to be.
The ferocious me leaves when she's looking at me.
She's well defined, should'a been in a dictionary.
And everything I do for her is preliminary.
I'll meet her parents and ultimately we'll get married.
Not to divorce her, if ever she falters.
She knows I feel totally altruistic towards her.
I got my ice on her, I'll cure her nausea.
Tell'em other pursuers to get off her.
Now here's my heart, she can have it for free.

And of course I know how much she loves Porsches.
So coming from my world tour look what I bought her.

Anything you want, baby lemme know.
You should lemme know.
You should lemme know.
Anything you need girl.
Just lemme know.
Just lemme know.
Just lemme know.

When you leave finding a better persona.
Would be impossible she said as I phoned her.
I never will girl, you're one in a whole lot.
You're not the hottest in the world, but to me you're solar.
Light up my life and take away my darkness.
When things fell apart she never departed.
And though I stole her heart she'll never be heartless.
She draws me close to her she's such an artiste.
Now on the market her type is outta stock.
But if you're looking for her I wish you the best of luck.
And she loves me and I her, that's just how we rock.
See, I'm all she desires not even my bucks.
And trust me, trust is only what we have.
Anything you want lemme know and you'll have it.
See it's my habit to give you what you want.
I'll give you what you need, just lemme know.
