I Ain't Got No Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


I ain't got no reservation.
I'm just sitting here listening to you.
I ain't got no reservation.
I'm just sitting here listening to you.

Talk is cheap if you can't walk the walk.
I listened to you I heard what you said.
Now you got to do it today.

I listened to you, I heard what you said.
It don't mean nothing if it's just in your head.

I listened to the words you said and I know just how you feel.
You can't preach to the converted I know the deal.
Now it's coming to the time when you gotta walk the walk.
You gotta make it happen man I can't listen to you talk.
