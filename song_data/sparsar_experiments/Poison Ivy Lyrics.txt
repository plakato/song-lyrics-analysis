Poison Ivy Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Slowly her blood will kill him.
Dying upon the leaves of poison.
Body and mind.
Helpless I watch him leave us.
Lurking in utter darkness.
Hiding from his past and his pride.
Sadly I've been where you are so I know that.
All the things you think you know and.
All the things you say you love are just.
Lullabies at night, echoes of her lies.
You don't see it, pretend you're blind.
You're afraid of what you might find.
You need her poison to numb your mind.
A victim of her barren soil…
Don't fear your own conviction.
Don't be a remnant of her craving.
Distinguish life from lies.
I know you hurt just the way she hurts.
I know she cries just the way you cry.
But what you never share is that one smile.
Trust me; I've been where you are so I know that.
All the things you think you know and.
All the things you say you love are just.
Lullabies at night, echoes of her cries.
Don't live her lie, you're not blind.
No need to fear what you will find.
Drain her poison out of your mind.
Don't be the victim of her barren soul…
