Datamosh Lyrics
by Yung Jake.


Shout out to David O'Rielly 
I got a Max beat behind me. 
I'M doing me, making .gifs 
On the web. Ryder, Ripps 
It's cool cause, it's nerdy, 
Yeah, 
, 
Datamoshing cool datamoshing, great 
Justin, Bieber move him with my face. 
Then use it for an art show, use it for a piece 
Projected. On a apple projected on a peach. 
Find me on the Internet, I'm making gifs 
I don't give a fuck, though I don't give a shit 
Move. The bitch with my hand, make'er back it up. Now 
I'm a gangsta. Bitch, I'm tatted up now: 
Swag's 480p. 720p 
I'm in the club, like spending 20 g's 
Sipping on my cup, with a pretty ho 
bitch 
You thought it was an accident, a video glitch 
I did it on purpose, though ... it's nothing. 
You, don't have bad Internet, I'm just datamoshing 
, I'm on my web shit ya heard me: 
It's cool cause. It'S nerdy, 
 
I'm on my datamosh glitching up these vide0000ooos 
I'm on my datamosh niggas. Don'T know 
I'm moshing data making art on my computer 
You can't see me. 1st person shooter 
I'm on my datamosh digital effects. Man 
I'm moshing data geeked up can't stand 
I'm moshing data making music on my mac book 
I got swag.. You need to fall back dude,

Look. What I can do with this picture from Google 
I'm the shit mane., I'm so hot 
I'm with 2 bitches.. Now I'm not 
You. Think its connection, you think it's your bandwidth, 
But! It'S me. I'll steal your bitch, like a bandit 
See me on YouTube. fucking with video 
Find me on WorldStar., Find me on Vimeo 
I'm, not on Photo Booth. That shit's different 
Cause. They told me to step out of the frame, but I didn't 
I'm doing shit. Dese nigga, don't know digitally 
That's. Why I'm blowing up and these
hoes so into me? 
It'S, not an accident, I'm controlling it. 
I made this money so fast and I'm blowing it 
I'm in the club dawg. Getting dranks for free 
I gave these niggas my swag.. They should be thanking me 
 
I'm, on my datamosh glitching up these vide0000ooos 
I'm on my datamosh niggas. Don'T know: 
I'm moshing data making art on my computer 
You can't see me. 1st person, shooter 
I'm on my datamosh digital effects. Man,

I'm moshing data making music on my mac book 
I got swag.. You need to fall back dude 
, 
I'm selling out my dude better book a seat, 
Cause niggas think they on acid. When they look at me, 
Sipping on this lean and I'm getting geeked up 
I'm on my tech shit, doing what a geek does 
I'm on my datamosh. glitched out, swag 
Asked, your bitch out and she switched so fast 
She. Getting twisted like a pretzel 
She. All up on me like these pixels
