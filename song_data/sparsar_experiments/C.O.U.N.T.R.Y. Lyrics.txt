C.O.U.N.T.R.Y. Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.


Switch 
We, hoop and holler when old, Charlie Daniels calls that devil son of a bitch
 
Yeah, we plow it nail it bail. It then hightail it to town 
We, spend our pay day on them. Ladies and them long necked rounds, 
We gon na live out past the limits â€˜til the day that we die, 
We're from the banjo chicken pluckin' double clutchin', C.O.U.N.T.R.Y 
C.O.U.N.T.R.Y, 
 
We, like them shiny silver, buckle straight tequila, Wrangler, knuckle Barbie
dolls 
We, got them bait and tackle barbecutie Booty tannin' one stop shoppin' malls
 
We, like our Beech-Nut long cut Truck Nutz hangin' off of the hitch; 
We whiskey shoot it scoot it Fridays when we're hillbilly, rich 
Charlotte's brother's on the sofa eatin' chocolate pie, 
Out in the deer and dirt road, ruttin' corn row cuttin' 
C.O.U.N.T.R.Y 
 
Can, I get an Amen, Come On, Amen, 
, 
We love, our guns, our God. Our Jesus pledge allegiance too 
We bleed in John Deere, green red and white and blue 
Screw politically correct. We gon na. Let it fly 
Out in the get it good and stuck and mother truckin' C.O.U.N.T.R.Y 
C.O.U.N.T.R.Y 
C.O.U.N.T.R.Y
