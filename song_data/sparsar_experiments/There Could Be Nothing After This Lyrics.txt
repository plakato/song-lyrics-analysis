There Could Be Nothing After This Lyrics
by Underoath.

In the end we tend to think of how it began.
I could never explain the picture it painted.
And how it made me feel.
Now we see this emotion.
The light centered and overlooked.
You want to see me disappear.
Well, so do I, well, so do I.

Such a quiet evaporation.
We're nothing but hollow vessels.
In search of what makes us alive.
I never said this was my revolution.
When you looked me in the eye.
Oh, how I've walked this white line.
So many times before.
What a feeble attempt.
Just to feel alive.

This is for you and all your hopeless case.
You never would, you never would.
Leave me in your wish to fail every time.
Every time I try.

So talk about, talk about it.
At least it makes you feel something.
Inside.
Who have I become.
Who have I become.

Oh God, everything, everything.
All around me is crumbling at my feet.
Everything, everything.
All around me is crumbling at my feet.
I stare, so delicate and ashamed.
At the shell I've shed myself from.
I stare, so delicate and ashamed.
In the eyes, in the eyes of my ghost.
In the eyes, in the eyes of my ghost.
Well, I would never love me.
Well, I would never.
Will I ever love me.
Well, I can't.
