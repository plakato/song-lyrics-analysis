All For You Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


I have been heart broke.
Dead broke.
Sold rock.
Now I'm back at my feet.
And I'm back in my zone.
Told my teacher that one day I'ma be selling arenas.
My niggas told me that love ain't shit, start fuckin these hoes.
You are poppin my nigga, they love you, they need you.
All my niggas are so reckless.
All my niggas are relentless.
They said these bitches are worthless.
Dont give them your heart, just give them a grand.
Cause thats what they are after.
If I find the one thats real, I'maa'.
Tell her babyy dont go.
Tell her babyy dont go.
I'ma never let go.
I'ma never let go.
Never fall for a hoe.
Never fall for a hoe.
I been look for you.
Now look what I found.
Yeahhh.

Finally got what I want, I'm never gonna let you go.
If I got what I need, I'm never gonna let you go.
Everything is all for you yeahhhh.
Everything is all for you yeahhhh.
You can say what you want, I'm always gonna be there.
You can do what you please,I'm always gonna be there.
Rockin out to the end, like you are my best friend.
Rockin out to the end, like you are my best friend.

People change, I done seen it all.
They knock me down , Im tryna stand tall.
Like a nigga that ball.
At my lowest points, I thought you would call.
Maybe you didn't care enough.
Maybe you weren't in love.
As much as I was.
You played me bitch.
Tell me lies until I realise.
Fool me once, Do me twice.
Fool me twice, Tell me lies.
Like you just friends.
You grew up in the same ends.
Studio life Im caught up.
All my niggas told me.
Wish I believed demm, Cause they still Mandem.
And you just throwback, Switch teams J Colback.
She slam niggas like Novak.
I caught her creeping, I thought I was trippin.
She caught me slipping, Grey goose sippin.
Found what I want.
I am the one that she want.
I know she is different.
She is so intelligent.
She ain't never gonna fuck this up.
For some next man that rocks addidas suits.
Or ever creep on the low with her boss.
She wanna be her own boss.
I been look for a girl with qualities like this.
