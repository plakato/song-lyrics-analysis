All For You Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


I have been heart, broke, 
Dead broke, 
Sold rock 
Now, I'm back at my feet. 
And, I'm back in my zone 
Told. My teacher that one day I'ma be selling arenas. 
My niggas told me that love ain't shit start fuckin. These hoes 
You are poppin my nigga. They love you, they need you 
All, my niggas are so reckless 
All. My niggas are relentless 
They said these bitches are worthless. 
Dont give them your heart, just give them a grand 
Cause thats what they are. After 
If, I find the one thats real I'maa' 
Tell, her babyy dont go 
Tell, her babyy dont go 
I'ma, never let go 
I'ma, never let go. 
Never fall for a hoe. 
Never fall for a hoe. 
I been look for. You 
Now, look what I found. 
Yeahhh 
 
Finally got what I want. I'M never gon na. Let you go 
If, I got what I need. I'M never gon na. Let you go, 
Everything is all for you. Yeahhhh 
Everything is all for you. Yeahhhh 
You can say what you want. I'M always gon na. Be there 
You can do what you please, I'm always gon na, be there 
Rockin out to the end, like you are my best friend 
Rockin out to the end, like you are my best friend 
 
People change. I done seen it all. 
They knock me down. Im tryna stand tall, 
Like, a nigga that ball 
At my lowest points. I thought you would call 
Maybe you didn't care enough. 
Maybe, you weren't in love, 
As much as I was 
You played me. Bitch 
Tell me lies until I realise 
Fool me once Do me twice. 
Fool me twice Tell me, lies 
Like, you just friends: 
You grew up in the same ends: 
Studio life Im caught up 
All, my niggas told me 
Wish, I believed demm Cause they still Mandem 
And. You just throwback Switch teams, J, Colback, 
She slam niggas like Novak 
I caught her creeping. I thought I was trippin 
She caught me: slipping Grey, goose, sippin, 
Found. What I want 
I am the one that she want. 
I know she is different. 
She is so intelligent. 
She ain't never gon na fuck. This up 
For some next man that rocks addidas suits 
Or ever creep on the low with her boss, 
She wan na be her own boss. 
I been look for a girl with qualities like this
