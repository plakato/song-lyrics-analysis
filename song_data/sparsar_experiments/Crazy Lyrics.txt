Crazy Lyrics
by Swifty McVay.


I be rule things, cuz my moves swing on paperbel.
I'm Dr. Jeckyl and Dr. Jeckyl.
And I don't hide from the popo.
They tried to spot a nigga like freckles.
Psychiatrists be sneaking phone calls for them to catch us.
I used to walk the streets like a zombie.
With a live and vibrant, hungry called me ganja.
Couldn't calm me.
I'm known for taking vodka to AA meetings.
Then I dipped to give a nigga a sip while we was peeing.
And Swift ain't listening to you speak.
Till your people at meetings, giving em speeches.
On how they used to drink.
I been at the brink of insanity.
I'm still living at 357 Amityville.
Come and visit me.
My father handed me gats, we chilling in the backyard.
Having target practice and we aiming at the bats.
Living a Gothic childhood, my entire were gray and black.
I left at 17 and never come back.

I stay grouted in the motherfucker.

The streets turned me into a monster.

And when you see my gat, you're cardiac.

You niggas never make your money back.

And if you selling sex you running at.

I considered the murder Armagnac.

Your life is fiction and this is fact.

And I ain't caring if the prison's packed.

A lot of niggas hate me.
And daily I'm awakening to the smell of narcotics.
While niggas is shaking.
And they waiting for they fixes.
I'm cleaning my biscuits.
I done caught a contact in crack.
But still resisted it.
It really was funny how niggas thought I was a dummy.
And I couldn't handle it, taking advantage of my money.
Was hating, conformation, I'm taking medication.
And they thought I wasn't paying attention.
To conversation.
And yeah I heard them saying I was crazy.
Outta my mind, shady, and my gauge ain't never away from me.
They see that the demons come out in the day as well as night.
It's nothing stand in the way of the psychopathic juggernaut.
Whether the streets or in the house.
You can get shot faster than syringes.
I'm not giving prescriptions.
Stop calling me father, I'm psycho ward's finest.
You ain't a threat, I'ma promise I'm out my mind!

It's the indoctring of a madman.
Son of Sam, put his hands.
On any pedestrian.
Touched again, I'll be damned.
Piling your dead body up in your garbage can.
And if it is, then never doubt that I dropped it there.
You can smell it in the atmosphere when death is near.
Medicin cabinets feel with shit that doctors fear.
They say I'm talented man, but felon immigrants.
In my hand they found a screw big as a can and I am touched.
It's like being in Pakistan with laced blunts.
A deranged fuck, living life like a great nut.
As far as my slut, every day she's covered with duct tape.
I lay her in my basement and I bust up.
And guess what? They scared of my DNA.
They locked me for reproduction, but I freeze my cum anyway.
All I need is some bottles of Bombay.
Some rags and some matches.
Just to slam you wherever you stay!
