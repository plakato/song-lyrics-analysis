Not Today Lyrics
by Xperience.


You know it wasn't all good a few years ago.
The fact that I'm here right now is a miracle.
I just wanna make music for your stereo.
But no matter where we go.

They hate to see you smile, have a good time.
Can't fit my shoes, can't walk the miles.
They mad at my grind, head in the clouds.
I'm on my way though no time to waste.
I'm outer space, ain't on my level.
We're not the same you can't stop my shine.
Not today.
No not today, no not today, not today.
No not today.
You won't get me down, not today.
No not today, no not today, not today, no not today.
You can't stop my shine, not today.

No more hot dogs and baked beans.
Damn dog, you doing great things.
And they think they can fill these shoes?
Who? I don't even know who made these.
A little money in my jeans.
So I don't got to pose when somebody say cheese.
They created a monster.
A sleeping giant with an American dream.
Is it true your step cousins with Macklemore?
I don't know but you stepping on my Patrick Mohrs.
And I've been giving all my money to the pastor lord.
I'm trying to make it all back with these tracks and tours, but As soon as I.
step outside.
I can feel the hate before I get in the ride.
Look at how they mess with ya mind.
Making money off American genocide.
Today we ain't taking suggestions.
We are more than pedestrians.
Having a hard time trying to change the world.
Cause these people can be so negative.
I pay the bills with these Ted talks.
So my adventure time is so excellent.
Salty as hell so Pepperidge.
No wonder the bouncer didn't let you in boy.

They hate to see you smile, have a good time.
Can't fit my shoes, can't walk the miles.
They mad at my grind, head in the clouds.
I'm on my way though no time to waste.
I'm outer space, ain't on my level.
We're not the same you can't stop my shine.
Not today.
No not today, no not today, not today.
No not today.
You won't get me down, not today.
No not today, no not today, not today, no not today.
You can't stop my shine, not today.

Can't a young black man get comfortable.
Ooo, in something new?
Getting money off my two cents.
Too sick, Boy you the shit.
Number 2 with a number 2.
Aye I bust a move.
You know we came to party.
But hey, you never know we might save somebody.
Last year we lost a whole lot of soldiers.
Salute, God must be making an army.
Put the gun down, pick a book up and read.
Then pick the gun back up for your freedom of speech.
And tell em' we ain't never going quietly.
People praying that they babies gotta enough to eat.
So, I put faith in a mustard seed.
Hustling, trying to escape custody.
And while I'm on the subject.
Middle finger in the air like fuck police.
Police man, police man, you killing our future.
No piece man, no piece man, hands up and they shoot ya.
We say black lives, they say all lives.
But we just worried about our lives.
Way too many RIPs, black blood under cop lights.
I'm a thug cause I'm not white.
I probably sell drugs on the block right?
How the hell could we not riot Martin?
Everybody ain't non-violent.
So I don't listen what they tell me.
I'm too busy taking selfies.
I'm really feeling myself today.
Hope I feel the same way next week.
The sun is out.
Left the whip at the crib and I hopped on a ten speed.
Haters, let em run they mouth and take shots.
Ha! You missed me.

You know it wasn't all good a few years ago.
The fact that I'm here right now is a miracle aye.
I just wanna make music for your stereo.
But no matter where we go.

They hate to see you smile, have a good time.
Can't fit my shoes, can't walk the miles.
They mad at my grind, head in the clouds.
I'm on my way though no time to waste.
I'm outer space, ain't on my level.
We're not the same you can't stop my shine.
Not today.
No not today, no not today, not today.
No not today.
You won't get me down, not today.
No not today, no not today, not today, no not today.
You can't stop my shine, not today.
