Cocaine Central Lyrics
by Wu Block.

.
Raindrops of water that turn into hard glaciers.
Bob barker microphones I get paper.
My block is cocaine central.
Eat your food with ancient or new crew utensils.
Turbaned up like a royal prince from medeen.
With emerald green birthstones in my bling.
Rolex goggles.
Some of my best side bitches I ever had.
I kept in a bottle.
Sniff that girl whiff that girl.
Feel a rush from cuba no cut that's pearl.
An oily based extract from green leaves.
Set out to dry but comes right from the heat.
Packaged up then retailed on the street.
Yonkers all through brownsville that's sheek's.
With my connect I may be the.
next steve jobs.
My best custies is nerds with.
college degrees god.
Triple black ratchets champion cone hoods.
Blending in with killers that visit the wrong hood.
Pardon self never the wrong hood I'm safe.
And I ain't gotta knock on wood.
.
Cocaine central.
Sniff city needle park.
Fishscale mental.
Hustle get the weed to spark.
Niggas outside all day even after dark.
Niggas hustle hard.
Like the Gods don't believe in God.
.
I got uh.
Coke in my blood weed in my lungs.
Barely staying up.
About to get some fried chicken from Wong's.
She laying there.
Ass all fat in her thongs.
Hand me my gun.
Shades on blocking the sun.
Whip fresh out the dealer think tonite gone be fun.
Coke connect already calling.
I told him I'll take him but.
We can do better when his prices start falling.
Nowadays I feel there's no need to be greed.
Cause you can make the same money off of pills and weed.
Shooters indeed jail system taught him to read.
Streets taught him how to kill wolves taught him to feed.
Just like everything you learn you're gonna teach to your seed yo.
But I don't give a fuck.
I clap off try me nigga.
Keep that feather weight by me nigga yeah.
