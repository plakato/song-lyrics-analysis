Dark Matter Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

Tired of looking in the mirror.
Cracks seperate my face.
I'm not what you think.
I'm lost in make believe.
But why, oh God why are you doing this to me?

Can't stop looking out my window.
I don't know who I am anymore.
You'll wash, wash away all the secrets of my past.
The shattered reflection is all I ever had.

These are my last days cause hell has been calling for me.
Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy?
I am a disease and hell has been calling for me!
Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy?

Devour the darkness.
Hell find me!
Light defies me.
Devour the darkness.
Light won't find me.

These are my last days cause hell has been calling for me.
Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy?
I am a disease and hell has been calling for me!
Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy?

I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

These are my last days cause hell has been calling for me.
Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy?
I am a disease and hell has been calling for me!
Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy?
