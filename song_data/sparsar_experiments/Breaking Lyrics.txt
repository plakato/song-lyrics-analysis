Breaking Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

What could be so bad you'd think about walking out.
How could you take one step from the life we built.
And not want to turn around.
We can scream, we can fight.
We can spend the night sleeping in separate rooms.
Checkmate baby, waiting on the next move.
But it ain't about winning or losing.

I'll keep my heart wide open.
Take a bullet, take the blame.
Anything for you, you.
And I would chase every dream you can dream of.
Ain't a part of me I wouldn't give up for you, you.
Through the fire and the rain.
You're the one my heart keeps chasing.
Even when it's breaking.

Half a bottle of wine, the words fly that you can't take back.
Those sweet red lips firing shots out baby.
Cause you want to make me mad.
Throw me your keys, say you're gonna leave.
Shatter me piece by piece.
And girl you're trying to cut me deep.
When you say we never meant anything.

I'll keep my heart wide open.
Take a bullet, take the blame.
Anything for you, you.
And I would chase every dream you can dream of.
Ain't a part of me I wouldn't give up for you, you.
Through the fire and the rain.
You're the one my heart keeps chasing.
Even when it's breaking.
