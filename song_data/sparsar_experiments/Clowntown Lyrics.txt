Clowntown Lyrics
by Wordsplayed.


Oh my goodness.
Yeah, we out here.
Wylin'.

Had to send shoutouts to Marty and Fern and my misfits who wylin.
'.
My team on that Sosa, still beef with the dark like it's racial profilin'.
My, ooh!
Westside, foam cup with that horchata.
85 on that 5 South, we done messed around and hit Tiajuana.
Met a cutie named Catalina, but she ain't brave since they shot Selena.

So I dipped like, Gotta go.
Still hit the squad like da da doe.
Momma prayed for this vagabond.
No stone when I'm dead and gone.
That Clowntown, please turn it on.
No autotune, just autobahn.
Used to be the rude boy, derelict.
Now a brother walkin' with the Rock, Pete Maravich.
League chumps, lil' giants.
That big green, I used to eye it.
That fettuccine.
V12 in that lamborghini.
That white girl in that black bikini.
That red steak with that tortellini.
Now we fightin' like shoot the five.
Fiery darts, still duck and dive.
Cali' rolled through that full stop.
Hands up and that bass drop.
GP like it's '96, that Kirk Frank and that still hits.
Live free, die hard.
Little rascal, big God.

Clowntown, clowntown.
Clowntown, clowntown.
Clowntown, clowntown.
Clowntown, clowntown.

? and me, we used to scrape that rice from the pot.
There's people dyin'.
Y'all still debatin' if we can drink or not.
Shouts out to the squad.
Standin' up, mannin' up.
MOP on that ante up.
These other dudes still ? up.
Nah, see I ain't wylin'.
I'm just hyped about family business.
That lamb or lion.
Shouts to Gawvi, that boy's a witness.
Shouts out to the ladies.
All faith, no sight.
Standin' tall, point to the Word.
Shawties up on that Vanna White.
I put it on for my squad and ain't nobody stoppin' me.
I wanna see all the hands in the air like I'm pullin' a robbery.

Thank God, that good shepherd don't lose sheep.
Tribe of Judah.
Cliqued up, still 40 deep.

Clowntown, clowntown.
Clowntown, clowntown.
Clowntown, clowntown.
Clowntown, clowntown.
