Can I Get a Witness Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..


Can you kick it like I kick it when I kick this.
Can I get a witness?

Run.
New jacks better back up, before they get smacked up.
By the R-U-N-D-M-C.
Known as the tough cats, kickin tough rough raps.
In jeans, leather jackets, my Adidas and gangster hats.
A ?? ?? ??, yo here we go.
I'm tired of brothers tryin to front like they don't hear me though.
Knowin if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be able.
Cause I'm the man with the hand that rocked the cradle, uhh.
A lot of punk for the chunk baby that's a bet.
Album number seven and we still ain't finished yet.
I didn't get old, I got better at the craft.
Sat back and watched you try to kick it but you made us laugh.
So get back, you already had your chance to dance.
You proved you had no waist to fit in this man's pants.
Word to God, I'm back fo' sho'.
Hollis Queens gettin wreck so act like you know.

D.M.C..
As I spit this and get this out of my throat.
I need a witness to get with this - take notes.
Great quotes like boats float flowin so dope.
Never givin up hope, nope, know what I wrote.
I'mma saver spectator educator entertainer.
You wanna ask me, can't be now or later.
I'm a rough rugged person, been that way from the start.
Darryl Mack got the knack to put the H in heart.

A reporter with recorder was recordin the slaughter.
As I'm peepin 'cross the border leapin water keepin order.
Lit it up like a spliff, get a whiff of this hit.
Cause I flick em like bits, and I bust 'em like zits.
Dippin down to grip this microphone I rip this.
I'm glad not sad I flipped this, now can I get a witness.

Run.
Can I get a witness, can I hit a, never been ?? fitness.
Don't play like I'm bitter, when you come with your best.
And I make a suggestion save it David with your bull.
Cause you're full of congestion.
Soft? Never me, never get more hard.
The King of Kings, Lord of Lords, is the one Lord God.
Can I can I get a witness ?? ?? next.
To my God, DJ Run and I kick it.

D.M.C..
Suckers suckers suckers.
Suckers get flipped when I start to flip.
Slip in a clip when they die I dip.
Still spray a gun, see how DJ Run.
Leave a sucker stunned, gettin ill to the drum.
Mic check and I wreck and I'm second to none.
Accept it don't regret it I expect to get dumb.
So don't you forget this, we'll put you on the hitlist.
To stick ya stick ya wicked wickedest can I get a witness.
