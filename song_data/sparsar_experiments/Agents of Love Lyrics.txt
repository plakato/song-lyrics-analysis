Agents of Love Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Agents of love.
Scratching at your window.
Ode to love.
They're fucking up your halo.
They're just kicking at the door, oh, oh.
Kicking at the door.
They want your heart.

And agents of love.
Following your sister.
When they catch up.
You know you're gonna miss her.
They're just kicking at the door, oh, oh.
Kicking at the door.
Kicking at the door, oh, oh.
Kicking at the door.
They want your heart.

Keep your little fictions.
Keep them close.
Underground, underground.

And if you're feeling friction.
From men that can't drown.
Underground, underground.

There's something that you needed.
Then it broke.
I'm your man, I'm your man.

There's something that you needed.
Then it broke.
I'm your man, I'm your man.
I'm your man, I'm your man.
I'm your man, I'm your man.
I'm your man, I'm your man.
I'm your man.

And when you were young.
You would dream of leaving.
Now that you're gone.
They can hear you breathing.

They're just.
They're just.
They're just.
They're just.
They're just.
Dying to meet you.
Dying to meet you.
Dying to meet you.
Dying to meet you.

They want your heart.
They want your heart.
They want your heart.
They want your heart.
