Harder Lyrics
by Quan.


James' Dodgers: yo. Iight.

James' Dodger: Mind of a genius and the.
words of a thesaurusous/ I'll break into.
the hospital with patients rape abortionous/.
im tortureous for pedestrian unfortunately.
that's unfortunate/ I'm on to it metamorphosis with a pin crafted by sorceress.
/ ya'll can't catch up to me my head is bloated with gluttony/ my flow is disgusting.
as mustard be and I spit like I'm held in.
custody/ ya'll can't even mustard me you.
busted ya'll be busters B/ and I'm.
surrounded by fake MC's who think they fucking touching me.

Quan: No Mercy to the soul hitting niggas.
with a pad lock/ I love baseball and ima.
hit you with my red sox's/ With some red.
rocks and ima choke you with some dreadlocks/ and make ya bed stop and make yo.
fucking eye balls pop/ im so courageous that my flow is so contagious/ that.
when I touch a beat I make pass down the ages/ cutting niggas heart and I ain't talking bout I made you.
look/ im talking bout ill cut your fingers off deep paper cut/ ice cream on my.
face I bet you wouldn't get it/ but if you was a Constitution worker i'd bet.
you'd dig it/ im crusty and I ain't talking about your dad's lips/ now shut.
the fuck up before I kill you/ now you dead bitch.

James' Dodgers: I'm back like a squeal.
see through no prequel/ on a scale from one to ten im ten your nines equal.
/ I take this game and bend it down and.
steal its innocents/ I got the crowds.
attention when you rap they leave attention-less/ I take the beat and eat it up to feed the beast inside.
/ and all you rappers sleep on me like.
James' is just the least to stride/ if.
Jesus's is nailed to a cross then im on Easters side/ I need MC's to feast upon because I feast to be alive.

Quan: ya'll niggas had story's ima read you.
like a book/ time is short that's why I over look/ to be done with the dead.
lies of the red eyes to kill a part of yo body that you don't realize/ look at.
my tip don't you get my point look at the world/ dont you see the fucked up.
scenes that carries the means/ of the subjects of the beans that re exist in.
the world/ by hitting up on me hard I be like told you men star/ my words are.
here being scared/ killing shit I told you No Mercy/ now I be like I told you.
no effect im bout to go meteor and im graving for your soul effect.

Braindead Braindead Braindead Braindead Braindead Braindead Braindead.
