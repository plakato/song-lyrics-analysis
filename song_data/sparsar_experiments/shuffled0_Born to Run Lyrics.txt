Born to Run Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

In time you'll see.
I hit the road to find a job.
In time you'll see what the good Lord's done for me.
Was a lot like mine.
Talking about how it used to be.
Born to run.
From the life I've had to lead.
My father died when I was ten.
The old man, he passed away.
You should've heard that engine roar.
Had to feed my family.
I was born to run.
What the good Lord's done, done for me.
That's when I'd push it a little bit more.
Until I saw the price he payed.
No regrets, I've been blessed.

Born to run.
Made lots of money it all slipped away.
Six kids and a hell of a wife.
When I was young I was a hell of a man.
I always dreamed never gave up.

Times were hard my hands are still scarred.
I was born to run.
And all he said never crossed my mind.
Son, even when times got tough.
No regrets, I did my best.
There's an old man sitting on a front porch now.
Gotta hit the city right on time.
And when I'm on I'll always sing little song of mine.

I can't slow down.

I'm full and though it's miles away.
Can't slow down.
A large family that's the price you pay.
I was born to run.
Drove a tractor and trailer all my life.
Born to run.
