Organic Hemp Lyrics
by Unholy Homies.

Nigga I don't forfeit or take losses.
I jus drop bars that resurrects the corpses.
Extreme inner peace become on wit the forces.
Big blunt torsion.
Mastered the string theory so a nigga flossin.
Deals wit the devil ? he meet me it'll cost him.
Yell suck a dick to my four-men.
Lean and the sess keep callin.
Different color pills is assorted.
Unholy nigga a walkinnnn.
Abortionnnnnn.
I ain't ask for the matrix that I'm lost in.
Bullshit education courses I'm forced in.
... if the world end today than we all in.
But if the world still keep spinnin like spaldinnn we ballin.
Bet ya cash that I'm drug hoardin.
Now all the bitches got they tongue out like Jordan.
I need an espy all this that I'm sportin.
300 homies like we Spartans.
In the astrals wit the Martians.
Still poppin pills and the weed we be sparkin.

Herb be the sudden mood changer.
Highway to hell eluding danger.
Goth bitch smokin wu bangas.
I hold the blunt btwn my 2 fingers.
White styrofoam in my palm.
Passing the catacombs wit the fog.
I tend to use my knee to steer the car.
Just to po a 3 if I die what's the odds.
Whole roster full of gods.
My nigga chip resemble Jesus.
Just some creatures in the vintage peices.
Liftin mad Buddha got ya whore to spot me.
My bloodline prolly annunaki.
Weild knowledge that's considered godly godbody.
Call me double reek.
Codeine phosphate promethazine.
If you dunno ya chemicals mufucka that's lean.
Everydays a gamble zendaya blow the dice.
Tried to much drugs in my life.
That's obviously an act of god I'm still alive.
