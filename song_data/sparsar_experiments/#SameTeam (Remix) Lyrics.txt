#SameTeam (Remix) Lyrics
by Swoope.


What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king.
It's still 1-1-6 bruh.
Oh Lord! working for the same team.
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city.
Homie, Imma take that, take that.
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city, homie Imma.

Lecrae sell a million records.
And my name don't get mentioned in the review.
It don't matter, get the W.
Cause even players on the bench get rings too.
Way deep is what the crew is.
On the same team, all running the same play.
So you need to check your motives if you're doing this.
If you was mad Andy sold 28k ah!
Taking away from the mission.
All this division don't add up.
It all equals dissension.
Ya' ask me that's bad math bruh.
So yeah, I'm on Collision, but really I am indifferent.
If you 116 and independent.
No, you King livin', junkie dream itchin'.
Humble coffee bean sippin'.
Long as the mission and the team don't seem different.

Humble Beast is a piece of a piece.
Like a finger missing little.
little Richard.
With the scream but it's singing kinda simple with the keys.
Kinda tripping playin' notes.
Trying to listen can you hear it?
Oh you don't, cause your ear's with your feet.
Kinda different when the body ain't complete, huh?
What's the difference if the body don't compete huh?
That's a team picture.
IG it when you see us.

I just follow my marching orders.
Beg your pardon?
Tell me how I went from dead to pardoned.
Don't tell me how to testify.
I'm a wretch with an extra life.
That's how I continue.
Word to JGivens Bienvenue.
I'm killin' everything on the menu.
That's same team.
Grab a utensil, we eat!

What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king.
It's still 1-1-6 though.
Oh Lord! Welcome to the same team.
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city.
Homie, Imma take that, take that.
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city, homie Imma.

Humble as a mumble in the jungle of shouts and screams.
Digging tunnels under a stampede, beast!
Okay-kay keep, praying for the grace we stay cold but never freeze.
Like water at four-four blap-blap degrees.
Uhhh, fahrenheit, where was I, dare if I share a terabyte.
We don't care if you verified.
Your lil' brand is just a fraction.
In the middle of a grain of sand.
Or the hand of a master crafter of sand castles.
With the passion, imagine, decapitating dragons.
We are just a vapor on paper on another vapor of a microcosm of a remnant of.
minions.
Running like Kenyans like Obama.
Irrepentance to the Father.
Better warn the town the beast is loose.
And you on the same team.
If the dreams from the same king.
If it floats from the same stream.
If it don't then it's gangrene.

I think I kinda feel it, no competition.
Smelling like team spirit, Nirvana.
No Cobain, we blow brains when they ain't wanna hear it.
Same team we cliqued up now.
40 deep won't switch up, ha!
I stay two to the left and one to the right.
Got the kings ridin' with me when we take it to the mic.
Comin' from the bottom of the map and they're know we're comin'.
Unashamed shawty cause I ain't afraid to show it.
If it's southern California or it's dirty dirty Dallas.
Keep it slappin' in the Bay dog you know we gotta shout it.
Gotta switch it up like gang sign speak.
We take it all over every place I be.
We bring it to the church.
But don't hate on me.
Cause every now and then you gotta show ID.
I beast!

Oh look who they let out the cage.
They ain't wanna hear it from a kid underage.
Said he tryna get plates.
Give the boy a little grace.
I'm tryna be the light-skinned Puerto Rican MLK.
With a little bit a Dilla and a little bit of Lupe.
From the Cooday straight from a runaway slave.
Now I'm free with a fee that's already been paid.
Give the boy a little grace.
1-1-6 give 'em 16, ate 16.
Had a dream now I'm 18.
Give 'em 8 bars.
66, we a problem.
Get a solved for your number gain.
Working for the same team.
Why we tryna floss when we all got the same gleam.
They say the sheep's gettin' lost.
A mirage for the cause cause the sound's getting mainstream, uh!
