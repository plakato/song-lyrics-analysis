Perfect Bitch Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


One time for the nigga, cause I know you see me workin'.
Two times for my baby, because baby you deserve it.
You just can not beat the view, we gonn fuck to open curtains.
I hope she don't take it wrong, but I swear this bitch is perfect.
Perfect bitch, perfect bitch, I got me the perfect bitch.
And she know I'm on the move, but lil mommy with the shits.
Perfect bitch, perfect bitch, I got me the perfect bitch.
Perfect bitch, perfect bitch, I got me the perfect bitch.

Wear her hair in different colors cause lil momma like it dyed.
I might fuck her to some Prince, or to Biggie Hypnotize.
Get to singing to that pussy baby, I can harmonize.
Then you put my ass to bed, you my favorite lullaby.
I be spending all my days on the southside of.
The city love the boy on the southside of.
I been spending all my days with my perfect bitch.
Roll a blunt, pop a Xan, now we feel like we the shit.
She might strum away her pain with the strings of her acoustic.
She baptize my heart in her melanin, she proper.
Word to a nigga, like I could've been an author.
I look like Static Shock, girl come stimulate my chakras.

One time for the nigga, cause I know you see me workin'.
Two times for my baby, because baby you deserve it.
You just can not beat the view, we gonn fuck to open curtains.
I hope she don't take it wrong, but I swear this bitch is perfect.
Perfect bitch, perfect bitch, I got me the perfect bitch.
And she know I'm on the move, but lil mommy with the shits.
Perfect bitch, perfect bitch, I got me the perfect bitch.
Perfect bitch, perfect bitch, I got me the perfect woman.
