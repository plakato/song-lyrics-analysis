Songs That Said It All Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Just another typical saturday night.
Hanging out with the boys.
Nothing new cutting through those neon lights.
Always the same old noise.
Just about the time I was looking to leave.
I caught that look in your eye.
You were dancing with your friends when I cut in.
And the DJ got it right.

And we sang, just skipping through the words that we didn't know.
We danced, in the middle of the room like we were all alone.
And I couldn't say what you were doing to me.
So I left it up to the melody.
We sang, sang along to the songs that said it all.

Well the lights came on after that last song.
But we weren't ready to go.
Putting off good night and hoping you might.
Let me drive you home.
Foot on the gas, hearts beating fast.
To the sound of the radio.
Well it's almost like they had us in mind.
Every line, every single note.

And we sang, just skipping through the words that we didn't know.
We danced, and the way you were moving was turning me on.
And I couldn't say what you were doing to me.
So I left it up to the melody.
We sang, sang along to the songs that said it all.

We sang, just skipping through the words that we didn't know.
We danced, in the middle of the night just letting go.
I couldn't say what you were doing to me.
So I left it up to the melody.
We sang, sang along to the songs that said it all.

Yeah the songs that said it all.
The songs that said it all.
