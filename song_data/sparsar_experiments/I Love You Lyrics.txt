I Love You Lyrics
by Woodkid.


Where the light shivers offshore 
Through, the tides of oceans, 
We, are shining in the rising sun. 
As we are floating in the blue. 
I am softly watching you 
Oh boy, your eyes betray what burns inside you 
 
Whatever, I feel for you. 
You only seem to care about you 
Is there any chance. You could see me too 
Cause. I love you 
Is there anything. I could do 
Just to get some attention from you, 
In the waves. I'Ve lost every trace of you 
Where. Are you 
 
After? All I drifted ashore 
Through the streams of oceans, 
Whispers wasted in the sand. 
As we were dancing in the blue. 
I was synchronized with you 
But. Now the sound of love is out of tune. 
 
Whatever, I feel for you. 
You only seem to care about you. 
Is there any chance, you could see me too 
Cause. I love you 
Is there anything. I could do 
Just to get some attention from you, 
In the waves. I'Ve lost every trace of you 
Where. Are you 
 
Whatever? I feel for you. 
You only seem to care about you 
Is there any chance. You could see me too 
Cause. I love you 
Is there anything. I could do 
Just to get some attention from you, 
In the waves. I'Ve lost every trace of you 
Where. Are you ?
