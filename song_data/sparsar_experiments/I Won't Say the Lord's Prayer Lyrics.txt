I Won't Say the Lord's Prayer Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.


It's a series of bars, thrift stores and churches lining the streets.
While women with gold crosses push kids into half-formed beliefs.
If Lot was righteous, I think I'd rather not be.
We lean on fences built from out-dated morality.
It's a gang mentality.
It's a dangerous thing.
They don't ask you to think.

And assume you're too careless to look at it critically.
You'll stop progress if it contradicts what you're told to believe.

I refuse to spend life on my knees.

These billboards that flaunt these scare tactics.
Make me think you're only good if you're afraid of being punished.
Every single Sunday, church bells wake me up.
But it's never enough to pull me out of bed.

The church on Main Street has got its doors painted red.
And I guess it's so the Angel of Death passes over it.
On its way to get gas.
The church over on Broad Street has got a neon sign that says Jesus Save Me.
And I guess it's so God can see from where he is in the cheap seats.
I refuse to spend life on my knees.
And I won't let somebody else make my decisions for me.
If we're all just Christians or Lions.
Then I think I'd rather be on the side with sharper teeth.
I don't need saving.
