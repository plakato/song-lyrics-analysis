Lila's Song Lyrics
by Xazz.


I do not want to go it alone.
We'll turn a couple heads without you girl.
And only he who knows the songs that she wrote.
Running all the funny colors down the sink with your coat.
Red rubies shining bright in the dark.
Shielded by the cover of your fast beating heart.
So Johnny rocking farther, shout in the night.
And we've got just enough for autumn, so we turned out the light.

Yeah! You know they talk about it.
Yeah! You know I thought about it.
Yeah! You know you thank me for it.
Every night and day.
Every night and day.

If you decide to close up the shades.
I still will find a way to watch you girl.
So when the words, they run, run right through her hand.
Running rivers from her mirrors to the pull only band.
Who knows the other motives of we.
My momma always said that there were fish in the sea.
The lights are burning, so let's cut to the chase.
I know you thought I said I love you, but this isn't a race.

Yeah! You know they talk about it.
Yeah! You know I thought about it.
Yeah! You know you thank me for it.
Every night and day.
Every night and day.

Ooh, we all know you wanna.
Ooh, we all know I'm gonna.
Ooh, you know I wanna take you all the way.
Oh, oh-oh.

Instrumental.

Bad business coming to an end.
But did you really think that they would catch you girl.
Too many 'maybe's is what you said to me.
Though we both knew very well this was not meant to be.
Hold thought before I rip it away.
Don't wanna throw 'em back to bed, this ain't no time to play.
The blinds are closed, well I can see right through.
Because the night is finally over, and I'm over you.

Yeah! You know they talk about it.
Yeah! You know I thought about it.
Yeah! You know you thank me for it.
Every night and day.
Every night and day.
Every night and day.
Every night and day.
