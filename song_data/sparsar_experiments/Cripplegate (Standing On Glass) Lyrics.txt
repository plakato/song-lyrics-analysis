Cripplegate (Standing On Glass) Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

Shake sleep.
Wool and glass.
Hung on nails.
Here and there.
Wails the wall I pass.
In you alone.
In you alone.
There is no harm.
In you alone.

Your sound.
In a picture frame.
Your burlap silken scarf.
Right hand stares down the left.
I wish to know nothing here.
Save the blood of the cross.
In you alone.
In you alone.
There is no harm.
In you alone.
