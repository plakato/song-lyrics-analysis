Despite What You've Been Told Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Well I guess by the blood stain of your lips.
And the wonder of your finger tips.
I should prove true to my emptiness.
And stay here.

Well, I'm just a kid of ill repute.
But the skin I wear's my only suit.
And you, you're just a substitute.
For the one that I hold dear.

You know you could be anyone.
God forgive my tasteless tongue.
I never should've been set free.

I cut my eyes, I skin my face.
Makes 'em how to be replaced.
That's how we deal with boys like me.

But I guess by this world so sick with loss.
And your services so free of cost.
I should climb down off my rugged cross.
And lay with you.

But you know by know it's half past late.
And I only came here for escape.
And you, you're just my next mistake.
Like me to you.

You know you could be anyone.
God forgive your unborn sons.
I hope they don't end up like me.

I drag my mind through streets of shame.
Blame myself, forgive the game.
That's how we deal with boys like me.

But despite what you've been told.
I once had a soul.
Left somewhere behind.
A former friend of mine.

And I hate to speak so free.
But you mean nothing to me.
So, if the street lights they shine bright.
I'll be home tonight.

I guess by the dim light in your eyes.
And that to you all things come as a surprise.
I should set the steel trap of your thighs.
And dive right in.

But to you I'm just a confused child.
Insecure or in denial.
Go raise your robes, go have your trial.
I'll let you win.

You know I could be anyone.
God forgive what I should have done.
My thoughts enough to guilty be.

Yes, I guess I made this bed.
But I'll take the sidewalk instead.
That's how we deal with boys like me.

But despite what you've been told.
I once had a soul.
Left somewhere behind.
A former friend of mine.

And I hate to sound so true.
But I mean nothing to you.
So, if the street lights, they shine bright.
I'll be home tonight.
