Leave Me Alone Lyrics
by Xperience.

I don?t want to be alone.
Don?t leave me tonight.
Come on, hold me tight.
Baby, don?t leave me alone.
I don?t want to.
Explain my feelings to.
You, my friend.
?cause you?ll never understand.
I just want to.
Be in your arms tonight.
I don?t care.
If i?m wrong or if i?m right.
The morninglight.
Will take the love away.
Stay with me.
Till the breakin? of the day.
Hold me now.
Baby, don?t leave me tonight.
Love will die.
In the golden morninglight.
