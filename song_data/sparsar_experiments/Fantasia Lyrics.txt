Fantasia Lyrics
by Antonym.


harmony of similar sounding instruments. The track was named after the Disney.
movie in order to pay homage to the musical production behind the film, which.
only enhanced the moving effect of the movie. Much like the music in the.

experience. A world of fantasy, bliss, confusion, and reflexion is what lies.
beyond this opening door.
Enjoy the rest of the album.

\- Anton Bouffard.
