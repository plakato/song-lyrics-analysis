HiGrade Lyrics

High grade, high grade.
That what I'm smoking on.
High grade, high grade.
Legalize.
High grade, high grade.
Thats what we're toking on.
High grade, high grade.
Advertise.

Yea I've got my good kush rolled.
Everyday we blow it, never bush weed smoked.
From the natty man I get it on the eastern coast.
Some boys never have it, they just sit up and pose.
Still the police waan know.
Where's the ganja field so the plane flies low.
Soldiers in the hills, where the sensimania grow.
And it's warfare, so gunshots echo over.

High grade, high grade.
That what I'm smoking on.
High grade, high grade.
Legalize.
High grade, high grade.
Thats what we're toking on.
High grade, high grade.
Advertise.

We roll, we smoke, we fly.
See me on the corner, with my marijuana, in the sky.
No dope, no coke, no pipe.
Just a meditation, and an elevation, higher heights.
See us when we rise up, with our eyes on the prize.
Push wunna lighters up.
Roll one and light it up.
We keep the fire burning, now matter how they fight us.

High grade, high grade.
That what I'm smoking on.
High grade, high grade.
Legalize.
High grade, high grade.
Thats what we're toking on.
High grade, high grade.
Advertise.

Cause you know it's good sensi we're burning.
On this battlefield yea my eyes are red.
The way that the world and the system is turning.
Yea the situation is so dread.
Fighting over my grade.

High grade, high grade.
That what I'm smoking on.
High grade, high grade.
Legalize.
High grade, high grade.
Thats what we're toking on.
High grade, high grade.
Advertise.
