Belly Of the Beast Lyrics
by SwavyKilz.


In the belly of the beast it's a hip hop.
Feast.
Got the goblins &amp; The rebels come &amp; dance with a devil fuck 2 fingers.
nigga.
There ain't no peace.

Rocking from the baby cradle.
Drinking tea at the coffee table.
No disobedience,Mom grabbed the jumper cables,so unstable,people called her.
Kathy Baker.
Walked out the house &amp; said Thank Me Later.
Nothing been the same in the game ,Fuck a traitor.
Swavy Kilz, I do this shit for the thrills.
I contemplate poppin pills.
To help me with my ills.
Ya Girl go down like she got fish gills.
Pressure always get to me.
Constant mental chills.
Shit is really real.
I rap my own Will,Call me dr.phil.
Constant struggles on my mind.
Real niggas on the grind,this that shit that'll end mankind.
It really sucks we all blind just sit back &amp; Let me Unwind.

Unleash the belly of the motherfucking beast.
Your favorite rapper is bout to be deceased.
From the west to the east,last but not least,Killen niggas with venoms &amp;.
serums.
Don't Make suggestions.
Dont even ask Questions.
Or Me &amp; PG gon' have to pick up them weapons.
I'm trash at punchlines but i can break ligaments.
Flow full of wickedness.
Mind filled with sickness.
I Put lead in your daughters food.
Cause she wouldn't send me nudes.
Childish?Who the fuck you think you talking to?
You better watch ya mouth,i swear this is deja vu.
Corbin Blu dance off,Push it to the limit.
You know once you hand me the mic im gonna kill it.
Working on my lyrics so please pull out the tool box,dumb bitch.
