In The Hate of Battle Lyrics
by Xasthur.

Heiled in battle again.
Into the night eternally searching and.
Fighting to be eternally free.
And to live in darkness.
Decaying upon their crosses.
Light without will.
Seeing only with  blood in our eyes.
To deny them their empires.
Take the light from their lives.
Blinded by their own crying winds.

Hatred bled onto the soul.
With a fury to kill.
Killed brethren.
Without respect for lives unholy.
A hatred possessing my soul.
With a fury to kill.

So the battle dies in this bleak winter.
Each death piled in a dark circle.
And again we'll return.
