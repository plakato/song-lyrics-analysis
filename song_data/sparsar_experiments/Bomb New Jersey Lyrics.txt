Bomb New Jersey Lyrics
by Voltaire.

There's a magical land I know.
A place where I grew up.
And I'd make a deal with the devil himself.
To see that place blown up.

There in that interesting land I know.
Where no one has a brain.
They all wear jeans that are acid washed.
And yet they think I'm insane.

I would get down on my knees and service the Japanese.
Till i reek of old sushi, but please.
Bomb New Jersey.
I would happily kowtow to my new leader Chairman Mao.
I would even learn Chinese, just please.
Bomb New Jersey.

I would go tell Jong Ill Kim that they're making fun of him.
In a kimchi-hating town that's known as New Jersey.
Better yet I've got a plan, I will convince Pakistan.
That India can be found somewhere in New Jersey.

New Jersey is the place where i grew up.
They pelted me with rocks and garbage.
I guess it's tough to be a fruit in the Garden State.
And if you have a sexy girlfriend then they're doubly irate.

I would climb a rocky crag and plant a Russian flag.
On a smoldering hole once known.
As New Jersey.
Oh, it would be a tragic loss if both Bon Jovi and The Boss.
Are somewhere out of state when the Danes.
Nuke New Jersey.

It's a place named after a sweatshirt.
So what more can you expect sir?
And if you try to express your individuality.
They will throw you to the ground.
And they'll kick you in the teeth.
Like they did to me.

The bombs come down on Morris Town.
And Trenton's up in flames.
Newark we drowned, then burnt it down.
But Elizabeth still smells the same.
Many butts will breach on Marmanth beach.
We'll erase Orange from site.

But before I leave this land I loathe.
I bid New Jersey Goodnight.
