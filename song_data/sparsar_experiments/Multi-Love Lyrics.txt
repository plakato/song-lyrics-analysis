Multi-Love Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


Multi-love.
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room.
Who is your God, where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko.
She don't want to be your man or woman.
She wants to be your love.

Multi-love.
All of the other stalker daughters dragged her under.
May all her minds be made up.
I'll be her Vicodin, expired and escaped to Valhalla.
She don't want to be your man or woman.
She wants to be your love.

Multi-love's got me on my knee.
We were one, then become three.
Mama, what have you done to me?
I'm half crazy.

Multi-love.
It's not that this song's about her.
All songs are about her.
The sun shines underneath us.
Fearing new kinds of mind control and just blaming each other.
She don't want to be your man or woman.
She wants to be your love.

Multi-love.
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room.
Who is your God, where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko.
She don't want to be your man or woman.
She wants to be your love.

Multi-love's got me on my knee.
We were one, then become three.
Mama, what have you done to me?
I'm half crazy.
Multi-love's got me on my knee.
We were one, then become three.
Mama, what have you done to me?
I'm half crazy.
