Multi-Love Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


Multi-Love 
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room. 
Who is your God. Where is she 
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko 
She? Don'T want to be your man or woman. 
She wants to be your love. 
 
Multi-love, 
All of the other stalker daughters dragged her under 
May. All her minds be made up, 
I'll be her Vicodin expired and escaped to Valhalla. 
She, don't want to be your man or woman. 
She wants to be your love. 
 
Multi-love's got me on my knee 
We. Were one then become three 
Mama? What have you done to me? 
I'M: half crazy 
 
Multi-love 
It's, not that this song's about her 
All songs are about her 
The sun shines underneath us 
Fearing, new kinds of mind, control and just blaming each other 
She. Don'T want to be your man or woman. 
She wants to be your love, 
 
Multi-love 
Checked into my heart and trashed. It like a hotel room. 
Who is your God. Where is she 
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko 
She? Don'T want to be your man or woman. 
She wants to be your love. 
 
Multi-love's got me on my knee 
We. Were one then become three 
Mama. What have you done to me? 
I'M, half crazy 
Multi-love's, got me on my knee 
We. Were one then become three 
Mama? What have you done to me? 
I'M? Half crazy
