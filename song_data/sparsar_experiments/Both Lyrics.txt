Both Lyrics
by Yung Jake.


I see two bad bitches, I want both.
I am drunk and high, nigga I am both.
Mix Hypnotiq with the Henney, I am Hulk.
Niggas on the balls, niggas on em both.
I got coke, I got molly in my coat.
Balencies, all up on my toes.
Bad bitches, nigga I got both.
You can't get into my crib I got a moat.
I hit the bitch on Facebook, poke.
Nigga all up in my space like smoke.
I see two bad bitches, need a vote.
It's a tie, imma take em both.
If she don't give me top I am ghost.
On god, on my team, on my bro.
On my dad, on my mom, on em both.
When I stack the bread it turn into a loaf.

I see two bad bitches I want both.
White bitch, black I like both.
When I can't decide I'll probably take em both.
Took em home and I gave it to em both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.

I smoke dope, and I'm selling dope.
But what the price though, I need a quote.
Cause I flip it, then I skip it like a rope.
And whatever I don't serve, I will toke.
Bad bitch, let me get a grope.
Two titties, feeling on em both.
With a white bitch, black bitch, both.
Cause I'm a black nigga, white nigga, both.
Treat bitches like I'm post to.
I got bread, I got bread, like a toaster.
And these bitches stick to me like a post-it.
Past the blunt, now i'm about to roast it.
I hit the bitches, pass it to my broski.
In the club so hot, it getting toasty.
And my phone so dead I need a Mophie.
And that pussy so good, it need a trophy.

I see two bad bitches I want both.
White bitch, black I like both.
When I can't decide, I'll probably take em both.
Took em home and I gave it to em both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.
I see two bad bitches I want both.
