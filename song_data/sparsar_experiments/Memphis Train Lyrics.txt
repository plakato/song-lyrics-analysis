Memphis Train Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Woo, woo, woo.

Train number one is gone.
Train number two is gone.
Train number three is been gone.
Now how long must I wait for you.

Uh, all right.

Time I laid my handkerchief on the floor.
I'm getting ready to crawl, yeah.
I'm getting down on my knees.
I'm getting ready to crawl, yeah.

I said, ooh, wee, the Memphis train.
Hey, now, now, now, now.
Ooh, wee, the Memphis train.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Train number one is gone.
Train number two is gone.
Train number three is been gone.
Now how long must I wait for you, all right.

Uh, oh, shucks, uh.

Ooh, wee, the Memphis train.
Hey, now, now, now, now.
Ooh, wee, it's a Memphis train.
Yeah, oh, got me going now.

Oh, it's coming.
It's coming down the track.
It ain't, uh, it ain't, uh.
It ain't coming back, no, it ain't.

It's going.
Going down the track.
Yeah, it's moving on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's got me moving.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
It's got me moving.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.

Got me coming.
Got me working.
Got me moving now.
Got me cooking now.
Got me grooving, oww, yeah.

Got me moving, uh.
Keep on down the track.
