Memphis Train Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Woo woo woo

Train number one is gone
Train number two is gone
Train. Number three is been gone
Now. How long must I wait for you

Uh all right

Time? I laid my handkerchief on the floor
I'm, getting ready to crawl yeah
I'm, getting down on my knees
I'm, getting ready to crawl. Yeah

I said ooh wee the Memphis train
Hey. Now now now now
Ooh wee the Memphis train
Yeah yeah yeah

Train number one is gone
Train number two is gone
Train. Number three is been gone
Now. How long must I wait for you all right

Uh, oh shucks, uh
