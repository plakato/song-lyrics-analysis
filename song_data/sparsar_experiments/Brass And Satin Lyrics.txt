Brass And Satin Lyrics
by Vogue.

Well, oh my blue faced traveler, hang up your hat.
It's time your stories were told.
He brought me ivory apples from the white orchards in the ocean.
He brought you black and white roses from the unknown shores exotique.
He brought you sick aortas from the city of hearts crowned in flame.

But oh my blue faced traveler, two suns scorch and sear above the ocean.
And they burn and they boil and soon your ship of sterling silver becomes a.
raft of Medusa.

Sing us another song, Captian.
To the solar twins hovering overhead.
Ooh la la, the brass one and the satin.
Ooh ooh la la, the breathing and the dead.

Sing us another song, Captian.
To the solar twins hovering overhead.
Ooh la la, the brass one and the satin.

Lost at sea, the ocean of hungry mouths and broken teeth.
The swollen tongues...hysteria.

Oh but the cupids with crooked wings.
Are circling the sky like hungry vultures.
Watching with arrows of love, love.
They get closer and closer.
And with pupiless eyes do gaze under your skin.

Sing us another song, Captian.
To the solar twins hovering overhead.
Ooh la la, the brass one and the satin.
Ooh ooh la la, the breathing and the dead.

Sing us another song, Captian.
To the solar twins hovering overhead.
Ooh la la, the brass one and the satin.

Lost at sea, the ocean of hungry mouths and broken teeth.
The swollen tongues...hysteria.
