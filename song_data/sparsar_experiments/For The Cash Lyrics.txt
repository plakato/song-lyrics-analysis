For The Cash Lyrics
by Two-9.


So my name Bomani, it's the year twenty fourteen.  I.
was 'pposed to graduate this year. But I graduated from Two-9 high school..
Muhhfuckas.  My major was...aye.
, gettin' to it....

For the cash.
He in the mask, like a mascot.
For the cash.
He in the mask, like a mascot.
For the cash.
He in the mask, like a mascot.
For the cash.
He in the mask, like a mascot.

See us all black, heart attack.
When they see us all black, heart attack.
When they see us all black, heart attack.
When they see us all black, heart attack.

Night rider whip, ridin' wit all kinda shit.
Michael Knight, push it right.
Trans am, that body tight.
Outta sight, outta mind.
I swear I make it hard to find.
Discreet how we movin'.
Niggas shootin' and bitches Cuban speakin' fluent.
So the pack right, and I got my sack like a meadow full of green.
Martin Luther had a dream.
And I'm all about my cream, guess we on the same thing.
Fo' life until I die, see me with the same team, Two-9.

For the cash.
He in the mask, like a mascot.
For the cash.
He in the mask, like a mascot.
For the cash.
He in the mask like a mascot.
For the cash.
He in the mask like a mascot.

See us all black, heart attack.
When they see us all black, heart attack.
When they see us all black, heart attack.
When they see us all black, heart attack.

Heart attack.
Heart attack.
Heart attack.
Heart attack.
