Ancient Mars Lyrics
by The Zolas.

I want to believe in time travel.
That one day I'll come back for you.
Find you in the campus library aisles and I'd say.
Oh my ancient Mars.

When the rusty rocks were covered in groves.
And the pyramids foretold acidic snows.
All was still breathing like my hands on your toes and I said.
Oh my ancient Mars.

Several billion golden years ago.
I lost a planet that I loved to the cold.
Civilization blooms and then it erodes. And that's it.
Oh my ancient Mars.
