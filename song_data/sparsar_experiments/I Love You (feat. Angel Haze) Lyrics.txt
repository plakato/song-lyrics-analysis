I Love You (feat. Angel Haze) Lyrics
by Woodkid.


Where the light shivers offshore 
Through, the tides of oceans, 
We, are shining in the rising sun. 
As we are floating in the blue. 
I am softly watching you 
Oh boy. Your eyes betray what burns inside you 
 
You were a maze to never be completed 
And. I fell through cracks in all your little secrets. 
But, your grip, won't! Let me free and closed eyes. Won'T, let you see 
That out of everything you are arises: mystery 
, 
close, 
Colors washed by the endless tides by the end of the cycle: faded, slow 
Back to walls with the holes punched in by the ends of a fist with knuckles
swole 
Back to the chick that Lost control back to the pain that can't be shown, 
 
Whatever, I feel for you. 
You only seem to care about you 
Is there any chance. You could see me too 
Cause. I love you 
Is there anything. I could do 
Just to get some attention from you. 
In, the waves I've lost every trace of you 
Where. Are you 
, 
Break 
Everything? I feel for you swallowed salted tears for you 
Is there any chance. You can feel this too 
Now my heart's, a bid for you. You put all your quid onto 
I. Just want you to make me a part of you, 
 
Whatever, I feel for you. 
You only seem to care about you 
Is there any chance. You could see me too 
Cause. I love you 
Is there anything I could do 
Just to get some attention from you, 
In the waves. I'Ve lost every trace of you, 
Where are you 
 
Or can't be seen or can't be felt. 
Or can't be shared with no one else. 
I chose my shade. I made it green 
I lost myself when I made your team 
 
Back to the name I'll scream forever, from a place that can't be home. 
Safe from the grasp of the rage ensued by a thought process that can't be
slowed 
Where ill be when you realize. I can't say: 
But dawn goes down today and nothing gold can stay. 
 
Whatever, I feel for you. 
You only seem to care about you 
Is there any chance. You could see me too 
Cause. I love you 
Is there anything. I could do 
Just to get some attention from you. 
In the waves. I'Ve lost every trace of you 
Where. Are you
