New York City!
You are now ridin'.
With 50 Cent!
You gotta love it!

I just wanna chill and twist the la.
Catch stunts in my 745.
You drive me crazy, shorty I.
Need to see you and feel you next to me.
I provide everything you need and I.
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry.
Got some questions that I got to ask, and I.
Hope you can come up with the answers, babe.

Cuz I just wanna chill and take a ride.
Shotgun in your 7-45.
Oh baby you know I got your back, and I need to feel you next to me.
We got a baby and you know that I.
Would have another, man I want your child.
Sometimes I really wanna cry, cause the love is so good.

Girl, it's easy to love me now.
Would you love me if I was down, and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Boy, if you really love me now.
Can we walk down the aisle?
Cause you know I'm gonna hold you down.
Cause when you was down and out.
I was still around.
You gettin' money now, but I still got love for you.

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century.
Could I count on you to be there and support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz.
Would you poof! and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive.
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside.
If I ain't rap cause I flipped burgers at Burger King.
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink, you know, a nightcap.
And we could do what you like, I know you like that.

If you fell off tomorrow, you could stay at my crib.
If you didn't smell so good, I would still have your kid.
If you got locked up, I'd put money on your books.

You could still keep the hoopty, if you couldn't cop a Benz.
Boy I'd never dip out, like some of your friends.
If the boys try to get you, I'd be by your side.
Like Cleo from Set it Off, and you know I'll ride.
If you gotta peel a cap baby, do it papi.
And if a chick wanna a piece of me, I know you got me.
You have to work at Mickey D's or Burger King, I'd be there for you cause I.
kknow we gotta eat.
