My Room Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Welcome here, I'm your guide.
Through this life that once was mine.
Walk with me now understand.
What you see here is nothing and all.

Look around and see my paintings.
Be sure to take your time.
In my room, my life.

You've stepped inside so now come and learn.
That in this room, what you learn is what you earn.
There are no answers offered except: Yourself.
Remember this and the path you seek will be found.

The sweet scent of silence all over.
And all the sounds to see.
This room is you and I.
It's all we were and will be.
Just look at the paintings and see.

Spare your mind the silence.
From which you'll lose more than you'll gain.
Paint yourself with the sounds you lack.
Mix past with today and soon you will know.

Know how you'll change.
Starting all over again in a special way.
A certain confusion as the secrets unfold.
Forget all you learned and were told.
Then you'll change.

Come, walk with me now and understand.
What you see here is nothing and all.
Walk with me now, understand.
What you see here is nothing and all.

Look around and see my paintings.
Be sure to take your time.
In my room.
With.

The sweet scent of silence all over.
And all the sounds to see.
This room is you and I.
Open your eyes and feel the change.
