Just A Scratch Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


We cannot choose the time we live. In/ 
We can only choose/ what we do/ with the time. We are given/ 
 
Only, when your own mind becomes difficult to grapple, with/ 
Will. You know that you won't get the Sistine Chapel pics/ 
Let alone God's mind, or why he let Eve. Take the apple bit/, 
But you'll know that you'll always have an example: in/ 
Your, ancestors heroes and heroines who championed/ 
A Way of Life by giving it up. That'S exactly when/ 
Your old head should be bowed, but you shake it very Scooby/ style 
You, don't understand now/, but God always knew thee/. Child / 
I was told God's favorites always have hard times on the last line/ 
I said: “God, don't pick favorites. So I still ask why/: 
We, went through sadistic suffering, baptism of fire/ 
It's done now, but we wan na be more than survivors/ 
They'll, be no scabs to puncture, but the scars will remain/. But what's 
A few more of those when you weren't far from Hell's reign/ 
Bismilaah ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Hallelujah/, 
ὁ, κύριος, μου, ὁ, θεός μου, My Lord, My God- John 20:28/, 
My God, I will praise you/ 
 
I'll be resurrected. I'M like a white cue, ball/. 
Put me in the hole it's just a scratch: the truth: y'all/ 
Saint, spitting sweeter switching/ to speaker, stitching/, 
Holy, Hollowed, Honey, Having Heathen Stricken/ 
Resurrection. We want to live even half of this/ 
Cause. How you go ever scare. A Lazarus, / 
And everywhere no bear trap. Snare is hazardous/ 
When you stare at death. You can't help but laugh at it. /
