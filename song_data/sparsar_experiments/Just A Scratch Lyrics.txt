Just A Scratch Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


We cannot choose the time we live in/.
We can only choose/ what we do/ with the time we are given/.

Only when your own mind becomes difficult to grapple with/.
Will you know that you won't get the Sistine Chapel pics/.
Let alone God's mind, or why he let Eve take the apple bit/.
But you'll know that you'll always have an example in/.
Your ancestors, heroes and heroines, who championed/.
A Way of Life by giving it up, that's exactly when/.
Your old head should be bowed, but you shake it very Scooby/ style.
You don't understand now/ but God always knew thee/ child /.
I was told God's favorites, always have hard times on the last line/.
I said “God don't pick favorites, so I still ask why/.
We went through sadistic suffering, baptism of fire/.
It's done now, but we wanna be more than survivors/.
They'll be no scabs to puncture, but the scars will remain/ but what's.
A few more of those, when you weren't far from Hell's reign/.
Bismilaah, ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Hallelujah/.
ὁ κύριος μου, ὁ θεός μου My Lord, My God- John 20:28/.
My God, I will praise you/.

I'll be resurrected, I'm like a white cue ball/.
Put me in the hole, it's just a scratch, the truth y'all/.
Saint spitting sweeter switching/ to speaker stitching/.
Holy Hollowed Honey Having Heathen Stricken/.
Resurrection, we want to live even half of this/.
Cause how you go ever scare a Lazarus! /.
And everywhere no bear trap snare is hazardous/.
When you stare at death you can't help but laugh at it! /.
