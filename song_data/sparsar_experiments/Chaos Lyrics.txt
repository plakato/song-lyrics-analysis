Chaos Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

Into zomhlaba 
Phaphama 
Asikho isikhathi sokuhlala uhlanye, 
Kuyatshisa, Kuyabanda, 
Kuyabanda, Kuyatshisa, 
Skhipha, iDust, Skhipha indlala, 
Sweet Noise, 
Skhipha Malang AK eLokhshini to Poland, 
Zukile Aka, Malang, efela, 
Azishe, lapho, 
Azishe, Azishe, Azishe, 
Skhipha, iDust, gcwala, 
, 
Another dawn breaking 
I`m, all alone 
Through. This nights and days on my own 
I`m, a lost soul, knocking on your door, 
Victims of terror and civil war, 
My brothers and sisters 
Living on the run 
Hate to see you brake and suck their guns. 
Life is pain but it`s hard to die 
Hard to live among the thieves and lies 
When the doves cry. My beauty is born 
Brother step for a while and make it your home 
No losers, 
No, better, no worse, 
Down in the gutters. I know you can 
 
Rise rise, refuse and resist 
My child of fury, 
You`re, the one I miss 
 
In your eyes, see stars of faith. 
Don`T, give up 
Accept the pain, 
When, your freedom dies, 
I, break down and cry 
When. Your freedom dies. 
It means the end of our road 
 
Asikho isikhathi sokuhlala uhlanye 
Kuyatshisa, Kuyabanda, 
Kuyabanda, Kuyatshisa, 
Skhipha, iDust, Skhipha, indlala, 
Skhule, kanzima, 
Singo, mafunga, angajiki, 
Sulinye, mbezi, 
, 
Your cry and fire in your eyes, 
Respect to the ones that live and try. 
I swear to God that the fuckers forgot 
That you die of hunger in your broken homes. 
In the lands wiped of the map. 
I can feel the gap in my broken heart: beating 
Mama, it`s, dark, 
So, dark and cold. Now, 
Where`s your promise 
Where`s your pride and love now: 
Another dawn breaking 
Out in the streets where life ain`t faking 
No sun for this hungry child 
Out in the bloody east 
The west north south 
Bare sticks, 
Dust and bricks, 
Politicians playing same dirty tricks, 
And. The crowd got mad and my beauty got shot 
Down in the gutter. 
In the mud and blood 
 
Qhawu Qhawuku ujingi 
Qhawu Qhawuku ujingi abantwana, bedlala, 
Kuqhuma, irhuluwa, 
Umtwana, zibekhe, kahle, 
Kuqhuma, irhuluwa, ilife, ngamahla, ndenyuka, 
Kuyabanda, Kuyatshisa, 
Sihlanganisa, amathe, neNyembezi, 
,
