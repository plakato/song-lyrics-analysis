Ambien Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Rip out my lungs and then leave me to live.
Acquire my soul and take all of my limbs.
I'm tryna get famous I wanna get rich.
You step on my toes and boy you gon' get lit.
Envying my life and my clothing boy.
Watch me swing the blade like a kite in the open boy.
You can't hear a sound.
Then it's left to the right.
Feel a motherfucking gash on ya neck from the knife boy RIGHT?

Tired of waiting i'm out of this place.
Gimme cash and some fame and i'm outta the way.
If I S.E your girl then she might have to stay.
Fuck her skull and her bones then it's off to her grave.

Posted in the middle of the shade.
With a black drop top smoking haze.
You can find me in the place with a babe wearing bapes let it shake in the.
race rooting for the fucking player of the day bitch way!

And that's from a real nigga trying.
In a jungle even if I fucking feel like a lion.
Gotta finish even if I fucking feel like I'm dying man.
I'm on another level and I feel like I'm Ironman.

Couple bitches did me dirty, now I'm tired and I'm.
Ready to explode but when I see em' I say I ain't mad.

It's some sour to the face, on the frying pan.
Life is a bitch trynna keep up with ya lying ass.
