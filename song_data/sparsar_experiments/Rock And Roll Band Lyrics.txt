Rock And Roll Band Lyrics
by Boston.


Well, we were just another band out of Boston.
On the road to try to make ends meet.
Playin' all the bars, sleepin' in our cars.
And we practiced right on out in the street.
No, we didn't have much money.
We barely made enough to survive.
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play.
People came alive.

Rock and roll band.
Everybody's waitin'.
Gettin' crazy.
Anticipating love and music.
Play, play, play.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis.
We were getting pretty good at the game.
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind.
You know everybody knew our name.
Livin' on rock-n-roll music.
Never worry 'bout the things we were missing.
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play.
Everybody'd listen.

Playin' for a week in Rhode Island.
A man came to the stage one night.
He smoked a big cigar.
Drove a Cadillac car.
And said Boys, I think this bands outta sight.
Sign a record company contract.
You know I've got great expectations.
When I hear you on the car radio.
You're goin' to be a sensation!
