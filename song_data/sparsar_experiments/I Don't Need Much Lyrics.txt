I Don't Need Much Lyrics
by Sway Clarke II.


Babe, beauty's in the simplest ways.
Babe, life can make you forget those things.

But don't get me wrong.
I love to live the fast life.
But I don't get turned on by the Louis Vuitton.
And all the flashing lights.
So for most days when rent's paid.
I party like it's my last.
Cause all I need's a rope chain and cocaine.
For me to get some ass.

Cause I don't need much.
Some cigarettes and alcohol.
IPhone for a few calls.
A crew and a main broad.
Cause I can't forget the pussy man.
I don't need much.
A party when the pain hits.
Rope chain and some new kicks.
Zig zags and a model bitch.
Cause I can't forget the pussy man.
I don't need much.
Cause I don't need much.

Babe, I told her what I really do.
She laughed and told me I was crazy.
But what's a kingdom for a fool.
Without a point of view.

It's just like I thought it would be.
Why won't you come with me?
It's just like it's always see it.
I'ma live for real.
I'ma live for real.
