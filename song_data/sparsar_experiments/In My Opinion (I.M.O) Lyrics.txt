In My Opinion (I.M.O) Lyrics
by Swazi Jive Entertainment.


They don't have the money.
They don't have nothing, no no no.
They don't have the trophy.
Still they have an opinion, okay.
They don't have the passion.
They will never put the work in, no no.
They don't rock the fashion.
Still they have an opinion, okay.

Didn't you check the flight.
Did you see that that motherfucker was charging out ?
Didn't you check the scheme.
Name one person who's darker who's still goin' harder.
No I don't talk a lot.
Like my battery died and I left my charger.
But you keep talking shit.
When did my life turn into your tellin', no no no.
Please just mind your business.
Get back to sippin' your tea.
You're looking green with envy.
Feeling froggy then leap, no no.
They never follow their dreams.
They just wish you were me.
Feel like Balotelli.
Ain't nothing that you can tell me.

They say they just couldn't get near me.
That that shit never compute.
Just cause they didn't do their thing.
That that shit never ?
They say that I will make your baby.
Without me losing a part of myself.
But you might as well talk to yourself.
I didn't ask for your help.
Said I live in a land where the police just hate on the skin tone.
And my tone ain't my ringtone.
But I been grown.
Look what I did on my own.
Shit I shoulda known.
I shoulda known.
I shoulda known.
That they gon' start tripping.
I'm looking like yes and they looking like no.
