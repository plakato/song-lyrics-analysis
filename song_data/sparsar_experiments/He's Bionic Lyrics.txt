Album: First Round Knockout.
Song: He's Bionic.

He's Bionic!
He's Bionic! He's Bionic! He's Bionic, Bionic, Bionic, Bionic!!!!
He's Bionic! Aaah Bionic!

There's no measure of the skills that are in his hands.
People ask Is he machine or man?
Positions what he's called or just Dr Dre.
People take a look cos he's your future DJ.
When he cuts the beat you all will know.
Because his records start to smoke and then his turntables glow.
If you're a sucka DJ then you'll have a comic.
Step to the front if you like embarassment.

He's Bionic! Yes!
He's Bionic! So fresh!

Acquired the skill that you must learn.
To become a DJ Doctor, not a grabbin turn.
Always seen wit you nurses by his side.
And you can bet that the Doctor keeps them satisfied.
His supersonic speed is his ace in the hole.
Over all the top DJ's, Dr Dre's in control.
He operates in LA cos it's the place to be.
He's B-I-O-N-I-C.

Now as the wheels start burnin and the mixer explodes.
The wax from his discs will make you suckas corrode.
Radiation level rises to degrees unknown.
The circuits overloaded then your speakers are blown.
Now ya hear a loud thunder that vibrates the ground.
Cos his hands are movin faster than the speed of sound.
Everybody runs and they try to avoid.
But it's too late cos the place is already destroyed.

He's Bionic!
