Ideas become real Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Ain't nothing serious pay attention i snatched the greatest then i seen the.
titles open so i thought i need those so i smash the haters basic raps are.
materialistic gold i be wearing be shining all over the place i walk on green.
green got to many faces its hard to read these bills star ice on my neck and.
ears aloha to these females in the islands.
