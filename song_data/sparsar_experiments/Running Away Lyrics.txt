Running Away Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


There's a place, in the park, we can go.
Where the lone, ?, find a home.

When you have not been, you never feel it.
Cause that something, makes you need it.

The only way, is to keep on, running away.
Keep on, running away.
Running away.
Keep on, running away.

In th rain, we fade, and ?
As the world turns, we all live, in the box.

When you have not been, you never feel it.
Cause that something, makes you need it.
No movement, no feeling.
When there's nothing to bleed in.

Instrumental.

Running away.
Running away.
Running away.
Running away.
