Show N' Prove Lyrics
by The Undergods.


I said I write a hundred rhymes. He said he wrote one rhyme a hundred times 
But it never sound tougher than mines. 
Spit a rhyme like Nasty Nas, 
Like, Jaheim Jadakiss to Jay-Z when he was on Jive 
When Wolf died. I was with Busta Rhymes 
So much time passed. I just can't adjust all the time. 
Here is the bread here is the blood. 
There are fifty thugs in the room. Here'S what we done! 
Crashed the mothership, the brothers of the UnderGods, recovered it 
Do. You prefer public or private punishment, motherfucker
