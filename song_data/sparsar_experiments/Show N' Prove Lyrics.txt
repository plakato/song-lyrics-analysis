Show N' Prove Lyrics
by The Undergods.


I said I write a hundred rhymes, he said he wrote one rhyme a hundred times.
But it never sound tougher than mines.
Spit a rhyme like Nasty Nas.
Like Jaheim, Jadakiss to Jay-Z when he was on Jive.
When Wolf died I was with Busta Rhymes.
So much time passed I just can't adjust all the time.
Here is the bread, here is the blood.
There are fifty thugs in the room here's what we done.
Crashed the mothership, the brothers of the UnderGods recovered it.
Do you prefer public or private punishment, motherfucker.
