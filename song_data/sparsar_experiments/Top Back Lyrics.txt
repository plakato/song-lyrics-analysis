Top Back Lyrics
by Z-Mane.

Opening: Z-Mane.

Let me tell y'all what's about to go down.
I done called two of my homies for this z-mix.
Stuff is crazy, naw'm sayin' ?
It's ya boy Z-Mane, let's get it.

Ok, this is the z-mix, man, you already know.
It's ya boy Z-Mane with a flow so cold.
Phillip Flame and Armyboy, they done came to steal the show.
It's that top back, nigga, if you ready, then let's go!

Ok, my mind on my money and my money on my mind.
Young nigga named Z, yeah, I'm always on my grind.
I like my beat down low and my top let back.
Ain't nothin' changed, mane, I'm still ridin' in the lac.
On some playa-type ish, you niggas just some lil squares.
When they see me ride by, they be looking kinda scared.
I got that candy painted blue lac, I thought you niggas knew that.
Man, put down that hot dog cause here comes the cool cat.
Z, dash, M, A, N, the last letter E.
Been killing this thing, can't nobody do it better, G.
When they see that caddy driving by, yeah, they know whassup.
Kirko Bangz in this thang, I got that drink up in my cup.
I'm like Tech N9ne when I hit the streets, I think my car is psycho.
But I stay on the safe side, I'm never needing Geico.
Statefarm, Allstate, Nationwide, or Progressive.
I'm still doin' my thing, ain't worried about no recession.
I ride by looking clean, yes, I'm so impressive.
They said they can't ride like me, it's the depression.
They finally learned their lesson, so, please, stop stressin'.
It's Thanksgiving, nigga, and I'm all about the dressin'.
Used to be in the passenger and now I'm in the driver's seat.
Shawty, if he ain't treating you right, then you can't ride with me.
Young Z-Mane and I'm doin' big thangs.
Yeah, I'm stackin' big faces, don't care about chump change, mane.

I like my beat down low and my top let back.
Still ridin' in the lac with some hoes in the back.
Ay, holla if you like your ride down low and your bass up high.
Looking like an O.G. everytime you ride by..
Ay!

Phillip Flame Talking.
Yeah......
Y'all know how to do it to 'em, right?
Haha, let's do it....

I'm a do it for Atlanta, Cob County know they missin' me.
I'm talking bout them niggas with Balleys and Louies on their feet.
These haters gon' talk and that's something that's gon' be guaranteed.
These niggas still runnin', I'm resting out here up in the lead.
I'm clean, I mean I'm really still shinin'.
I'm only 16 and I'm out here grindin'.
So high up in the sky, got a nigga think he flyin'.
I'm your girl's favorite rapper and the bitch ain't lyin'.
Call me Phillip Flame cause everybody know that he's hot.
And when it comes to bitchin' and snitchin', that's something he's not.
Oh, he fly! He swaggin' some True Religions, not Levis.
You talking bout a check, but you niggas out here in Reeboks.
And fee-lies, we riding with 4-15 like them 3-5's.
Let me stop, we mobbin' all day, so that mean that we rock.
Haha, I had to say what's what.
And I got it in the song with Flame Gang, whassup?
Let's do it.

Armyboy Talking.
I got you, Z!

Young Military Scary, y'all be softer than some fairies.
Am I ready? Yep, very, time for these boys to get buried.
Been in it since it began and stayin' until the end.
The city is what I ran and still runnin' it, man.
I'm chillin' with the fam, Phillip Flame, Z-Mane.
It's the military boy, you should know my name.
Ain't nothin' bout it changed, still stayin' the same.
Zoomin' all on these suckers, they ain't seein' a thang.
I'm steady pushin' that gas, city cruisin' like mad.
Flyin' across the land, still stayin' the man.
Music louder than bands, thought that you would know.
I'm deep up in that post, you should already know I do the most.

Z-Mane Talking.

What up, T.I.?

Look, now even though I like my beat down low and my top let back.
I be riding real slow, is there a problem with that?
I got my foot up on the gas, put the pedal to the metal.
Stop tryna act hard, nigga, and click that seat belt.
Ridin' down to your city, scopin' out for somethin' pretty.
Nigga, my flow neutronic, you might as well call me Jimmy.
Yeah, my flow cold, isn't it? Might as well let Hov hear it.
And my beat so loud, I bet LaTrayl and Toby hear it.
Ok, my money real big, the rims is real big.
You niggas hatin' on me cause I'm on some Tip ish.
Yeah, I'm ridin' in the lac with Army and Phillip Flame.
And if you even try to diss, nigga, we'll take you out the game.
Z-Mane!

Closing: Z-Mane.
And that was the Z-Mix.
