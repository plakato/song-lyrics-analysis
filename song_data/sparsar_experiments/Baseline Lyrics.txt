Baseline Lyrics
by Quarashi.

I give a shit about the kick.
That's been coming from the underground spot.
Beating the pop up.
The fuck up that lays all around.
Now give me sound from the other side.
Every night it's gonna go on.
And flow on and on and on and on.

Mister son of a gun I got a run now.
My time is over run you over like a Range Rover.
Oh my God, incredible superstar.
Throw some lyrics make them run like a super car.

When you know where I'm at, your fatter than fat.
Cause help me God if I ain't the cool cat.
Unequal, it's not even legal.
I'm chased by the rap police like Bugsy Seagel.

Baseline, baseline we've got fools from the base.
And their giving me baseline, baseline, baseline.
Baseline, baseline we've got fools from the base.
And their giving me baseline, baseline, baseline.

Now we've back in the game.
The Quarashi pain it's plain.
I see the suckers fall out.
And the fuckers call out,Pick me up.
But they don't know what it's about.

I do my shit on the mic and I'm pleasing the crowd.
Jump back, get back or else your getting a smack on your face.
Just like your daddy used to smack you way back in the days.
This ain't no silly ass game I'm playing.
Hear what I'm saying, now start praying.

Baseline, baseline we've got fools from the base.
And their giving me baseline, baseline, baseline.
Baseline, baseline we've got fools from the base.
And their giving me baseline, baseline, baseline.

What we have is breaking us down.
What we had is breaking us down.
What we had is breaking us down.
What we had is breaking us down.
What we had is breaking us down.

Baseline, baseline we've got fools from the base.
And their giving me baseline, baseline, baseline.
Baseline, baseline we've got fools from the base.
And their giving me baseline, baseline, baseline.
