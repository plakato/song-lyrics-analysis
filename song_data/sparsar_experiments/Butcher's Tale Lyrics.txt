Butcher's Tale Lyrics
by The Zombies.

A butcher yes that was my trade.
But the king's shilling is now my fee.
A butcher I may as well have stayed.
For the slaughter that I see.
And the preacher in his pulpit.
Sermon: Go and fight, do what is right.
But he don't have to hear these guns.
And I'll bet he sleeps at night.
And I.
And I can't stop shaking.
My hands won't stop shaking.
My arms won't stop shaking.
My mind won't stop shaking.
I want to go home.
Please let me go home.
Go home.
And I have seen a friend of mine.
Hang on the wire.
Like some rag toy.
Then in the heat the flies come down.
And cover up the boy.
And the flies come down in.
Gommecourt, Thiepval.
Mametz Wood, and French Verdun.
If the preacher he could see those flies.
Wouldn't preach for the sound of guns.
And I.
And I can't stop shaking.
My hands won't stop shaking.
My arms won't stop shaking.
My mind won't stop shaking.
I want to go home.
Please let me go home.
Go home.
