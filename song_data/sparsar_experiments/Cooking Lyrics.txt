Cooking Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


P-stones in the house and everybody cookin'.
P-stones in the house and everybody cookin'.
P-stones in the house and everybody cookin'.
Everybody cookin' everybody cookin' everybody cookin'.
Everybody cookin' wish like blau.

Up in my kitchen catch everybody cookin'.
Yeah I see yo bitch she over there lookin'.
Soon as she choose you know that bitch is tooken.

Up on starbucks in the middle of the night.
Hands grippin on the chopper I ain't talkin bout a bike.
Stone real hot yeah we whippin up that white.
And I don't give a fuck cuz my wrist is really tight.
And my wrist is really icey, yeah I'm really pricey.
I think yo bitch like me the nigga wanna fight me.
Yeah I got that chopper red beam on his head though.
Nigga talkin shit but I push his shit back though.
V-Nasty throw the free throws comes right back with three hoes.
Now I'm getting frito we cookin' up them kilos.
Money on my mind and I ski in a white girl.
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm rockin' in my world.

Now I got the cake you could say that I'm bakin'.
Look at all this money I'm flippin' I'm makin'.
I don't give a fuck cuz V-Nasty never fakin'.
Got that chopper on me and my chopper never breakin'.
You can take it to the block, ho.
Yeah I whip anything for survival.
Yeah I never lie ho.
Money on my mind and I'm gonna ride or die though.
Yeah I don't die slow.
I kill a bitch I kill a bitch I'm on this fuckin real shit.
Money on my mind and V-Nasty really kill shit.
Hundred dollar bill shit, throw it in the sky though.
You already know that V-Nasty be real idle.
And I wave bye when I'm in that fuckin jet.
I'm passin through 35th man I see the.

And niggas know that I been on this block before, huh?
