A Sermon in the Name of Death Lyrics
by Xasthur.

Ceremonies and worship inverted by suicidal mass.
Palace of praise and light, death and blood becomes its memory.
Taking its place, you can feel god's disgrace.
By a sermon preaching death to the dying.
Scattered hateful thoughts.
Pieces of brains hang from the cross it stains.
Poisonous grail, rewritten books, I lead you to fail.
Helping you sleep. Lost in your sleep, never to awake.
May your void become as deep as my hate!
