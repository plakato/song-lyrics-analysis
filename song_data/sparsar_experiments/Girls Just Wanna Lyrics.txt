Girls Just Wanna Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.


Girls we wanna.
We wanna, wanna.
We wanna have fun, have fun.
Girls, girls we need to have fun, fun.
Girls, girls lets have fun, fun, fun, fun.
Lets have fun, fun.

It's the weekend.
Time for meeting.
All my dogs will go creeping.
Spending dub after dub.
I'm wide awake in the club.
With no love for the hatas.
In the V.I.P. that hate us.
In the mix huffing and puffing.
Well all of that don't mean nothing.
No bluffing, we whilling, go carry on to criss styling.
All night we laughing and smiling.
Silk suites and gators we styling.
So sweet just like a pamper.
Putting musical hits down for Tampa.
From Washington to Atlanta.
From Havannah to Savannah.
Please can have a little fun.
Hit the floor we shake a little butt.
With my left leg down my right leg up.
Tilt my head back then finish the cup, huh.
Nigga what nigga what.
Lie and direct me I'm the one.
And the reason we come is to have a little fun cuz.

Girls we wanna.
We wanna have fun, have fun.
Girls, we need to have fun, fun.
Girls, lets have fun, fun.
Girls with my girls, girls we wanna.
I'm gonna have fun, have fun.
Girls, I need to go out, out.
Girls, give it up one time, time.
Girls, girls, girl girl.

Shorty why don't you and your friends.
Take a little trip with me in my Benz.
You ain't a brotha thrill from the coat.
Your girl in the back far from your boat.
Chilling up in my S-T-L.
Go get me room in the T-E-L.
Lock it down like a C-E-L.
So I can waive your B-E-L.
Huh, go and turn it down.
You know what them 69 Boyz about.
We don't play no mood no funk.
And I bet we can make you shake yo rump.
Fun if you want it come get it.
And if you see admit it.
Girl you can hit and split it.
Just go play wit it, aow.

Girls we wanna.
We wanna have fun.
Girls, we need to have fun.
Girls, lets have fun.
Girls, with my girls we wanna, we wanna.
I'm gonna have fun, I'm gonna have fun.
Girls, with my girls.
I need to go out with my girls, my girls.
Give it up one time for my girls.

We all into the mix roaming.
Strolling just roll it.
Benjamins we hold it.
With a gold thirty spokes rolex.
I'm folding them papers.
Disolve into vapors.
I got a trunk full of papers.
With a gangsta to wake up the neighbors.
I'll make ya get down.
All the way to the ground.
From Canada to Cancoun.
Back across the late line a doom.
Boom coming out ya speakers.
I'm breaking you like a beepa.
Close ya eyes and I'll creep ya.
Hit the Marriot and I'll freak ya.
Like Heavy-D and Monifah.
Big time just like Latifah.
Guaranteed to make ya get weaker.
Like a boom the bass is gonna keep ya.
And beat ya like Tyson.
If you don't believe me go ice it.
All the bills we sike em.
So high like Toni Braxton.
If you wanna get with this action.
Show em off like Michael Jackson.
Or sream like Janet.
So funkdafied you can't stand it.
Huh, nigga what nigga what.
Lie and direct me I'm the one.
And the reason we come is to have a little fun cuz.

Girls, girls we wanna, we wanna.
We wanna have fun, have fun.
Girls, girls we need to have fun, fun.
Girls, girls lets have fun, have fun.
Girls, girls with my girls, girls.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have fun, have fun.
Girls, girls I need to go out.
