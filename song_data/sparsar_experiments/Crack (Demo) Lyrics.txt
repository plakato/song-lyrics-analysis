D.M.C. 
Here's a story of a guy who used to be fly, 
He never would steal, he never would lie. 
The type of person. Money could not buy 
Thought. He be that way. Until the day he DIED, 
 
Run 
MAAAAAAN. He met this girl made his head. Swirl 
To him. She was worth more than diamonds'n pearls 
But. She wasn't like all the other girls 
Because. She was only out to crush his world 
 
D.M.C. 
He didn't care what his friends had to say. 
Cause he had to see the girl everyday 
He quit his work. His J-O-B 
And he got ta lose his touch with his family. 
 
Run 
HEEEEEEE would lie for herrr cold die for herrr 
Did. Nothing in the world, wouldn't try for herrr 
Get ill for herrr. He'D steal for herrr 
There's, nothing in the world. He wouldn't DEAL for herrr 
, 
D.M.C., 
He sold his car stole a VCR 
So low on dough. He went and robbed a bar 
He lost everything he had nuttin to LOSE 
For staying wit, this girl. He was paying his dues 
 
Run 
Well. He tried to leave, but the love was strong. 
He shouldn't have stayed with T'HER, so long, 
, 
D.M.C. 
Now, What's Going On, He sings the sad song 
What was right in his life has now gone wrong. 
He said I got to leave for a day or two 
But on the very next day. He said I need you, 
I can't live without you, and you know this true 
Cause. My love for you just grew and grew 
So. He took her home. She took him back 
They made so much love. He caught a heart attack. 
She drove him to his grave. That'S where he's at 
AND THE GIRL THAT KILLED HIM IS A GIRL CALLED CRACK.
