Crack (Demo) Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

D.M.C..
Here's a story of a guy, who used to be fly.
He never would steal, he never would lie.
The type of person money could not buy.
Thought he be that way until the day he DIED!

Run.
MAAAAAAN, he met this girl, made his head swirl.
To him she was worth more than diamonds 'n pearls.
But she wasn't like all the other girls.
Because she was only out, to crush his world!

D.M.C..
He didn't care what his friends, had to say.
Cause he had to see the girl, everyday.
He quit his work, his J-O-B.
And he gotta lose his touch with his family.

Run.
HEEEEEEE would lie for herrr, cold die for herrr.
Did nothing in the world wouldn't try for herrr.
Get ill for herrr, he'd steal for herrr.
There's nothing in the world he wouldn't DEAL for herrr.

D.M.C..
He sold his car, stole a VCR.
So low on dough, he went and robbed a bar.
He lost everything, he had nuttin to LOSE.
For staying wit this girl, he was paying his dues.

Run.
Well he tried to leave, but the love was strong.
He shouldn't have stayed with T'HER so long.

D.M.C..
Now What's Going On? He sings the sad song.
What was right in his life, has now gone wrong.
He said, I got to leave, for a day or two.
But on the very next day he said, I need you.
I can't live without you, and you know this true.
Cause my love for you just grew and grew.
So he took her home, she took him back.
They made so much love, he caught a heart attack.
She drove him to his grave, that's where he's at.
AND THE GIRL THAT KILLED HIM IS A GIRL CALLED CRACK.
