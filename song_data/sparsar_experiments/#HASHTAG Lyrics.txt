#HASHTAG Lyrics
by 67.

Sixty.
Fuck all the ops.
Free my niggas ten times.
Gang, Gang.

Skeng in a four door truck.
?
Come in tryna take that whole road.
And tryna jump in a ride through weapons.
Put the m10 on full burst and i'll show man teckers.
Tryna get Ps from Qs and Os.
Come on I really like them letters.
What's all the talk like me and my man weren't tryna dash stones that's.
sweaters.
Pull up in that stolen truck.
Backdoor bus, now i got pepper.
Tell bros step on the pedal.
Man left the crime scene hashtag ketchup.
Money and touch that skeng with the safety off cause the skeng there's ten.
there.
Everyday man moved food.
I swear down man come like some waiter.
Key the forty for the ob boys.
Now i put a middle finger for the hater.
Shoutout missed you a skeng man normal I thought about it later.
Cut off fifth corn him.
Nothin' like stones fuckboys better wear some layers.
I ain't ever fucked with dem man.
Er'body goin' on like i'm some traitor.
I only do me but i bang with the bros on my right i ain't gotta ask for a.
favour.
I can take man to the old days.
Most berg with a big light green laser.
Double tap at the ding dong window.
That's a go better pray for some for a saviour.

Man knows that I squeeze no section.
Two five no kick like teck 'em.
Got a couple shootings pendin'.
OT stack that no spendin'.
Do road for the bros cause I can.
SN two Zs in the night bag.
Ten toes on votes on my right van.
Don't get 'em mad he don't like man.
You won't like him.
But I love that.
No home for him man i bosh that.
Front Z that he mashed got a clutchback.
We ride round with a mac and a brockback.
I ain't sayin' he got drop burners.
I beg man fire that's some lead.
Trespass rounds 06 hear that man got skenged.
I jumped out a 4 door whip and i jumped off a one twos ped.
One twenty with the gang bro.
Two Zs up for the bando.
I bang for my bros.
And i trap for my bredrins.
There's two in the twelve.
Twenty five in the ten.

So they fucking the whole of the gang.
It's about time i get paid for this shit.
When they featured then throw me some bands.
Feds know that we spitting the truth.
So they went and put Scribz on the bands.
Got a shoutout to bugs and trap.
Cause they sponsored the block with some scrams.
I but oxes on road and I do road for my bros.
I ain't gotta talk niggas know, i been getting man with my pull.
You was trappin' on the bando.
Til i came squeezing the long nose spinner like jango.
Plus i'm the plug for am doe.
I'm sweet for the drink like mango.
It's either we hit or dash.
When we roll up with skengs and we crash.
One time we got peeped with the feds.
So Pete nearly lost us some mash.
But we still keep skengs in the 3 litre.
Trapped til they leave man hashtag dead up.
I can never stop selling Os do a lot for the door cause I need that bread up.

Dem man are other sides.
I can't trust my cousins.
I'll smoke off for my fucking brothers.
I got mad hate for them undercovers.
Tryna lock man up til man's thirty something.
I got bags of grub.
Tell the other sorrow we ain't servin' nothing.
Bare talk from them bitch boys.
When they see us they're cuttin.
Chef man up on the main road, you know Asap loves it.
Free young emmy.
You don't listen you so fucking stubborn.
Skeng, Skeng in a four door truck.
I'm tryna go ham.
25 shots in the mag.
That's for your whole gang.

They ain't in the field.
Why they asking questions?
Got work, no college can't teach me no lesson.
All my skengs if I didn't mention.
You either trap or squeeze if you're in my section.
Had the uck who's friends I went to corn him.
Your mate's cutting these shells.
They weren't even for him.
Ring trap am.
It ain't even mornin'.
Shouts kid, that's my G, that's my bro from mornin'.
Big rambo me not sure how it fits.
You can't care at all.
That's a 15 inch.
4 door, 4 man on a pagan strip.
4 man tryna crash at a paigon's wig.
Free m-skeng.
They got a real G locked.
I just smoke man.
I don't smoke pot.
Hashtag man down then I'm breezing off.
Ain't been in jail when i'm tryna dodge cops.
