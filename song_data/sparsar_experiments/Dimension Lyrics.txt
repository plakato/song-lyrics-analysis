Dimension Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

I fell down in the desert, baby, yeah.
Well, I had nothing but a piece of paper, oh yeah.
I had to write something down.
And I found myself alone.
Then I let go of everything into another dimension.
The purple haze is in the sky.
See the angel's wicked eye.
All these things we must try.
Until we see the reasons why, oh yeah.
Lightning crash on the hill tonight, yeah.
And I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright.
Then a horse came running to me.
Said, we're gonna go to the sanctuary.
Then a storm began to blow into another dimension.
The purple haze is in the sky.
See the angel's wicked eye.
All these things we must try.
Until we see the reasons why, yeah yeah.
I got lost in the desert, baby, yeah.
I found temples made out of a paper, oh yeah.
They all try Incomprehensible.
Building dreams in front of their homes.
Then I let go everything into another dimension, yeah.
