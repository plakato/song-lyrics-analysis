Blank Space - Acoustic Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things.
Magic, madness, heaven, sin.
Saw you there and I thought.
Oh my my, look at that face.
You look like my next mistake.
Love's a game, do you want to play?

New money, suit and tie.
I can read you like a magazine.
Ain't it funny, rumors fly.
And I know you heard about me.
So hey, let's be friends.
I'm dying to see how this one ends.
Grab your passport and my hand.
I can make a good girl bad for a weekend.

So it's gonna be forever.
Or it's gonna go down in flames.
You can tell me when it's over.
If the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex-lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane.
‘Cause you know you love the players.
And I love the game.

‘Cause we're young and we're reckless.
We'll take this way too far.
I'll leave you breathless.
Or with a nasty scar.
Got a long list of ex-lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane.
But I've got a blank space, baby.
And I'll write your name.

Cherry lips, crystal skies.
Yeah you show me incredible things.
Stolen kisses, pretty lies.
You're the Queen, baby, I'm your King.
Find out what you want.
Be my girl for a month.
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh.

Screaming, crying, perfect storms.
You can make all the tables turn.
Rose garden filled with thorns.
Keep me second guessing like.
Oh my my, who is she?
I get drunk on jealousy.
But I come back each time I leave.
‘Cause, darling, you're a nightmare dressed like a daydream.

So it's gonna be forever.
Or it's gonna go down in flames.
You can tell me when it's over.
If the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex-lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane.
‘Cause you know you love the players.
And I love the game.

‘Cause we're young and we're reckless.
We'll take this way too far.
I'll leave you breathless.
Or with a nasty scar.
Got a long list of ex-lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane.
But I've got a blank space, baby.
And I'll write your name.
