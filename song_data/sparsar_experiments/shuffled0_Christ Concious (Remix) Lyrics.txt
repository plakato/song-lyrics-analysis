Christ Concious (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

Mixed a couple pills.
Yall thinkin he could defeat us.
A blood'll get bloody if yall.
Dramas older than re-runs.
High when my tri.
So i won't let the sun set.
And i won't stop until im in a.
This shits incredible.
Im too live in the buildin.
Keep askin me about yo blues clues.
Baby.
Ill beat him like a fetus.
Side beside the villa.
Until we reach christ concious.
And i just might hit ya.
Like *kendrick gunshot ad-lib*.
But all im hearin is doodoo.
You need to prove that you dont need one.
Ya know.
A crip'll get crippled.
Like a motherfuckin news crew.
Put you and me inside a boxing ring.
Ain't noone i won't chew threw.
And figure whos who.
Is the hight of like 5 buildins.
Prepared for a better flow.
I mean g is us.
With cleets on a fuckin.
Im the mic killa.
And not wantin to swallow it.
In the cinema.
And fuck these bitches on.
What would you do.
Cerebral palsy compared to how we run.
I accidentally popped off.
Nah.
And i won't stop until im in a mansion.
Like a LSD laced edible.
Get it jesus?
Yall sets killin son.
Dont enter my vacinity.
Whats this shit with bitches.
Yall paws got.

In order to get a loan.
Speed bump.
Like a mew ooh.
Clone my sytle like a mewtwo.
We is the streets.
Nah.
My scrilla.
Just to let you know i only need one.
In yo ipod again.
Nah.
Eye balled em.
How many enemies want a enima.
Until we reach christ concious.
Suddely sayin that he won.
The horizon of my sight.
Dont tell me what the rules do.
Its whatever tho.
With a moon roof.
Look at all these faggots.
And poke a man.

Until we reach christ concious.
Starin at the city.
I got the munchies for money.
I mean jesus.
If you werent scared.
Until we reach on million.
Unless ya brought protection wit ya.
Christ concious.
With the liquor.
My bitch and a blunt.
Wuick whip wit the top down.

I might just get a knife.
Yall thought yall rap like kendrick.
