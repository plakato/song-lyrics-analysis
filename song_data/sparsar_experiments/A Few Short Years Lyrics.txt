A Few Short Years Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.

Go!

We headed out of Kansas in a flatbed Ford.
Just a couple hundred dollars, you an' me an' the Lord.
We didn't know where we were goin'.
We just knew we had to go.
Anywhere was better than Truvy's Hair and Nails.
An' workin' at a single pump Texaco.

And maybe it's crazy and we should've planned better.
Saved a little money from the little we'd made.
Guess we shoulda waited for a better moment.
Never taken that chance and played it safe.
Sometimes you've got to dance with danger.
An' sometimes you've got to face your fears.
What's your life if you ain't gonna live it?
Nothing but a few short years.
All right.

Well, I got a job in Pittsburgh working in a steel mill.
And if they hadn't gone busted, I guess we'd be there still.
We had a desperate situation laying in our laps.
Girl, I thought that you were kidding.
When you looked at me and said:.
Let's just throw a dart at that old road map.

And maybe it's crazy and we should've planned better.
Saved a little money from the little we'd made.
Guess we shoulda waited for a better moment.
Never taken that chance and played it safe.
Sometimes you've got to dance with danger.
An' sometimes you've got to face your fears.
An' what's your life if you ain't gonna live it?
Nothing but a few short years.

Here we are by our little Coleman camper, dancing by the light of the KOA.
Ain't it somethin' how we made it and we'd give it all back.
Just to chase a promise of a brand new day?

And maybe it's crazy and we should've planned better.
Saved a little money from the little we'd made.
Guess we shoulda waited for a better moment.
Never taken that chance and played it safe.
Sometimes you've got to dance with danger.
An' sometimes you've got to face your fears.
An' what's your life if you ain't gonna live it?
Nothing but a few short years.

A few short years.

Yeah, baby.
