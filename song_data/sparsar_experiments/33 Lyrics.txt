33 Lyrics
by The Purist & Westside Gunn.

458, i was leaning on the 33
30 on the lap. I pray t god that the don't fuck with me
Do you like Tony
In the shower with the chainsaw
13 gauge one shot, blew his face: off
Blood on the bottom of the pony, hair loafers
Spanish nigga. Every time i plug he playing soca
Yellow rice, half a chicken
Having shootouts in the fashion district
We mix the side in terrific leave his body twching
Gabanna goggles, 24, half a brick 
Im rocking 20 chains. Bitches think i hit the lotto
Gas stoves ticking in the kitchen
All that oil in the pot merry christmas
Loos at all the shit swimming

Ago. What up lord
You the same nigga praised dilla
Hopping out the 8 dragging chinchillas
Life is way better when you rich ain't, it
Money getting bluer
Money machine manoeuvres
We. Never talk we just do
Tell him, the god sent ya
Flashing lights. Dont. Make me ask twice: nigga
