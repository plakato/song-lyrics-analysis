Absolute Power Lyrics
by Akala.


Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
But absolute powerlessness does the same.
Its not the poverty.
Its the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane.

In a scheme of livin' my life wasn't hard.
But as far as britain goes shit I practically starved.
Sleeping in a track suit, gas meter runnin' out.
Electric cut off as well, candles lightin' up the house.
Lookin' in my momma's eyes I see how she feels.
The strain and the pain of just paying bills.
It ain't real, and thats how I grew like so many more.
And it is part of who I am.
I am very sure.
You wanna know the rage I feel in my stomach.
Knowing my mum and dad split up when I was still in her stomach.
And not everything that happened I will put in sixteens.
But I will tell you enough so you will know what I mean.
My boy's mother got cancer the same time as mine.
His mother died, and mine survived.
The shit was fucked back then.
When I was like ten already had the mental strength.
More than many grown men.

This was a couple years after my step-dad left.
Did he really know the crazy mess that he left?
Cos mum done' recovered from the lumps in her neck.
Being poor and alone just couldn't cope with the stress.
And I earn my big sis for.
So much soul that night hattan left school.
When she left home.
I was thirteen by now.
Still a little kid, innocent.
Next couple years though would turn him 'to a militant.
That is the result of no food in the fridge.
And every other day being searched by the pigs.
Fuck these patronizing teachers.
Don't want my grades 'slip, trynna' emasculate me.
-yeah turn me 'to a bitch.
And I dont mean a woman please lemme be clear.
I mean a spineless man 'cos what do they fear.
Than a working class black male with a brain.
When our energy is harnessed, every changed.
Look at 'Pac look at Marley look at Hendrix look at Garvey.
This is the potential that is wasted on a daily basis.
In this racist, classist world that we live in.
Still we comin' from nothing but we educate millions.

I understand why it scares you.
Its like how dare you.
Overcome obstacles that we have been careful to.
Place in your way every step of the way.
In this so called democracy where kids get sprayed.
Blacks and the Asians, Turks and the chavs.
Crowded in council flats, living like ants.
And who's more confused than the poor white trash.
Spouting the bullshit about they want their country back.
It never was yours, you should read more.
What they did to brown people they did to their own poor.
Peoples memories short, so much that im seeing.
Black and asian kids cussing eastern Europeans.
No pot to piss in, makes competition.
I fail to see how this is an effective system.
Cats and dogs in America and Britain.
Eat better food then most of humanity.
We spend our technology only on killin'.
How is this more than sophisticated savagery.
Its like its said, the world is a stage.
Each person's just an actor with a part to play.
Like the middle class kids, - kids of the rich.
Have everything, but yet still they pissed.
On coke and ketamine, strung out on heroin.
I ain't generalizing, look at the evidence.

Go to Glastonbury any year.
You will see, unlike carnival.
It won't be crawling with police.
This is London, the kids on the.
very next street.
Had a very different life experience than me.
In my experience they can't help but be smug.
After a lifetime of what they think's just good luck.
They're still more anxious.
And more frank cos'.
Unearned privilege weigh's like an anchor.
That's why they copy what we do, tryna' be what they not.
They will grow up though and get better jobs.
They will maintain the system they claim that they hated.
But they can't burn it down they got a stake in this matrix.
Hip-hop is just a fad to them, you didn't know?
But to us, this our living breathing soul.
And yeah they might backpack in South America.
Or even volunteer in an African village.
But all said and done, push comes to shove.
And shit hits the fan they're middle class and British.
That's just how it is, most rich brown people are just as full of shit.
So more concerned with they cars and jewels.
Most of the worlds poor looks just like you.
So more concerned with imprivileged few.
Most of the worlds poor looks just like you.
