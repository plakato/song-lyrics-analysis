Agora Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


I be that schizo motherfucker.
Walking with a shovel.
Keep the bodies covered.
Lurking with my brothers.
Killers by the hundred.

Bleed out my fucking eyes.
$carecrow the glorified.
Fuckboys get mortified.
Bitches get traumatized.

Can't you see in my eyes.
My heart's been paralyzed.
Never apologize.
God's been disqualified.

Demons are calling us.
My soul's been compromised.
59 homicides.
59 mommas cry.

Just got a motherfucking hand full of cash out.
Spend it all already on a head full of hash hoe.
Hope the weed will last yo.
Half a dub already smoked.
Turning ghost I'm burning Os.
Drunk and I go and I do this shit often.
And I know what they talk.
And then pull out the weapon we'll see how it goes.
Bitch get that stuff but she sick in the snow.

She bend the knee and now her.
Whole throat feeling cold.
Snow leopard seeking throws.
Throwing bones his clothes ain't glowing.
Bitch they need to keep you froze.

Nigga it's me and me people.
Where my head is to you that's a free throw.
It's the Crackhead, rolling up napkins.
Have to toggle my shit I'm a beast though.

Started off talking them pounds.
They talking up rounds.
And not with the fucking around.
Pull out the chopper.
If you start walking with them.
Imma start cutting shit down.

Imma re-up in a couple of weeks.
And be rich with the squad like a couple of g's.
Fuck with my niggas we coming for keeps.
Had to pull out the fader it fucked up the streets.
I ain't the nigga who stuck on the streets.
If you ready the die don't say nothing to me.
Imma bust out the track and then bust out the trap.
I just put in the work for a fuck with degree.

Cash in the bank then we stuck on the weed.
I'm just living our life feeling good as can be.
If you see what I saw ?
You be starving like Marvin I'm busting your teeth.

I'm just that nigga you couldn't compete.
Got that grass in the bag like there's wood in the tree.
If you asking for action then we let you have it.
You niggas afraid that you wouldn't want beef.

How much you pay when I roll in the deep.
Has your bitch on my knee.
Yelling put it to me.
Need to pack up her packs.
And say get the fuck out.
Cause I ?
When she pulling them G's.

I don't want static.
And you don't want heap.
Til I burn out that bag.
?
This nigga who died just for looking at me.

I be so nutty.
My wrist be so flutty.
My icey be dripping.
Just fucked up the scene.

Sipping on sprite.
Like that stuff is for cheap.
And my tummy is numb.
That's a cup of some weed.

I be just chilling with me and my villains.
You snitching you rats give up fuck 'bout some cheese.
I'm ready to harvest the harvest and me.
I'm just cooling it down like a cup of some tea.
And I'm out.

San have to make money.
San have a go.
Gonna make money.
Always fucking bitches at the show.

You a fake now.
Sipping lean with Drake now.
Hitting fucking corpses.
At the motherfucking base now, man.

I'm bossing all you bitches.
Keeping all of you ups living.
All I wish is for three bitches.
That can give me all the digits, woah.

Sipping lean in the cup.
With the bitch looking bruv.
Looking tough.
For the bitches that looking for all the drugs.

Now it's different decision.
I put my dick in the center.
And if you listen to Jynn.
My niggas wishing you with it.

It's like a subtle predicament.
If you with it we finish it.
If you dip in the middle.
We put a brick to your head and then.

? in the mist of it all.
Even before you benefit.
Get the rest of you call.
? get the business involved.
Get the business involved.

Like, damn how the fuck do you do that.
You just another motherfucker in a dorag.
And you can tell me I can hustle if I'm new jack.
Cause you get shot up in the gutter.
What you do that nigga.

Imma prove that.
If you two step.
Brother we can do that.
Get the crew bang nigga.
Where the roots.
Like where the cues at.
Hit 'em with pool sticks.
Like I'm gonna move back.
Crackhead.
