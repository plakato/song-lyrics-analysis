Broke and Famous Lyrics
by Rumor.


I was with a fellow musician the other day, name withheld.
We were trying to eat, walked into the restaurant of this hotel.
A few patrons recognized us. We started going through the pricelist.
The looks on our faces: priceless. We didn't need no one to advise us.
I faked a phone call and walked out.
He caught the rouse; he followed suit.
We went outside and laughed out loud.
Next stop was at my house.

They see me on T.V they say I be celeb.
It's funny man no money man no ref i dey use my legs.
And charlie trust me i still dey wey troski.
Small small e go be i will be where i must be.
Lifestyle of the broke and a little famous.
Sometimes i have dreams of chilling in Vegas.

Look in my eyes I'm sleep deprived i stay up all night and dream.
Imagination helps escape reality and as it seems.
From a.m to p.m put my frustrations on the pen.
Cos a brother still don't even own a pot to pee in.
I'm starting to feel the pressure.
I swore to never say yes sir to any boss in any office.
A nine to five could be a real stressor.
So I'm working twice as hard to make it and maybe then.
I wouldn't have to go back on my words like Arabians.
I know it may be grim.
Your light just may be dim.
Turn that sad face upside down.
Light your life up with a smile.
You see the old folk stay hopeful.
You can tell it by the hymns they hum.
I'm in the stu cooking som'in cos Sam Cooke said change gone come.

Next week i got a show; put my homey on the phone.
Tell am say i dey need some clothes.
I dey come do la-borrow.
I'm on stage looking like a boss.
Only thing i own my drawers.
Meanwhile a fan wondering how much my wardrobe cost.
Appreciate you putting me on that pedastal but truly.
I'm but a man with a gift and usually i rock no jewelry.
I'd much rather rock the stage and work the crowd into fury.
Leave'em debating my sentences like a jury.
