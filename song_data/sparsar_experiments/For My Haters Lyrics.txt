For My Haters Lyrics
by Z-Mane.


This for the shatters in my room.
All the players in my room.
I'll get my money, aye.
I'll get my money, aye.
For my haters in my room.
Talking that shit? Gonna get so blown.
That's on my money.
That's on my money.

Look, throughout my life, haters came and they went.
Thinking that really phase me, thinking that I'm a trip.
Man, I ain't worried about you niggas, yes, I know you exist.
But I ain't about to go and diss, that ain't time well spent.
For 12 years I've been rapping and so many were doubting.
But back then I couldn't blame them, mane, cause I was still sprouting.
They use to laugh and make fun of me saying, Oh, man, you ain't nothing, Z!
But now a days, when I pick up the mic, all they can do is run from me.
I've never been the type to give up my dreams.
So everyday I'm a put in work by any and all means.
Necessary, I'll bring the heat and the flow cold ad February.
And if they wanna hate, then let them hate, Z-Mane ain't never scary.
They say they hate you cause they ain't you, mane, and I believe it.
And I'm a keep doing my thing until I've finally succeeded.
G.O.D.'s the only man that I fear.
This is a message to my haters, hope you listen loud and clear.

Interlude.
The literary definition of a hater:.
A derogatory term in reference to critics of a person or an object.
I still see no reason for somebody to hate on you just because.
You're making it and they're not.
Maybe it's just not their turn yet.
But I guess the world never sees that.
This is a message to you haters....

I remember back in the day, I use to stay up all night.
Have my stereo blasting, trying to think of what to write.
I used to get so frustrated to the point where I just hate it.
Then I thought to myself: Look at how all these rappers made it.
They all went through the struggles, they all went through the pain.
They all went through the haters saying that they were lame.
Some of the made it, others sold out just for the fame.
But I promise you I'm gon' be the hottest rapper in the game.
They expect me to fall, they expect me to quit.
They expect me to sell out, but please, mane, I ain't having it.
So go ahead and have a fit, giving up, that ain't happening.
I'm headed to the top, I'll see you niggas at the balcony.
I hope you haters have been paying close attention.
Cause this song is to let you know Z-Mane is on a mission.
All your jealousy and envy just gon' make me even greater.
I'm a press the send button, this a message for my haters.
