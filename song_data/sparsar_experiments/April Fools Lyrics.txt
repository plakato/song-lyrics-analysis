April Fools Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.


Oh, what a shame
That your pockets did bleed on St. Valentine's
And, you sat
In a chair thinking boy, I'm such a prince 
Well life's a train that goes from february on
Day by day
But. It'S making a stop on April first

And. You will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
But, just until the fish start to smell
And you're, struck down by a hammer

Sure. You were swift
When. The handsome Greek boys dropped by with gifts
You are suave
Thanks to ribbons that open sesame
But in the stars and closer to home. In every planet
It ain't hard for me and dear jo, jo to see

That, you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
But, just until the fish start to smell
And you're, struck down by a hammer

So. Let it all go by
Looking at the sky
Wondering. If there's clouds and stuff in hell
Let it all go by
Looking at the sky
Wondering, if there's clouds and stuff in hell

And, you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love
Cause. You will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be

Cause. You will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love
