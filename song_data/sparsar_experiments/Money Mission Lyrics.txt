Money Mission Lyrics
by Xpertthief.

XpertThief :Yeah, XT.

Pistols like I'm Lara Croft.
Missiles aimed at the cops.
Your game sick dog no its not.
My gun bark my gun talk.
People think I lost it.
My lines homie don't cross it.
Cold flow get frost bit.
Rollie flow, watch it.
I be sicker than the average.
Mofo with a mic if you won't give it up I'll grab it.
My fabric designer cause that dough player I stack it.
I'm hotter than my jacket.
In summer time, in LS.
Fully zipped with my gun equipped.
I spray lead like pencil tips.
And break cars like elder hips.
Crush kids lays chips.
You mad homie don't give a glitch.
You lag son connection issues.
New magazine you read the issue.
Who is with you? no crew?
Bish I get the green, Mountain Dew.

Don't mess with me, I've been know to get silly.
Things are looking grim for ya, and I ain't talking Billy.
I'm riding round and I'm getting it x2 I'm trying stack a milli.
On the mission for the money and I ain't running but they never gonna get me.

Cash flow no cash flu.
Cause I'm sick jigga, pull triggas.
Fast lane and I pass you.
I'm at her waist like trash trilla.
She showing but we clap you.
Might lap you when I leave the dealer.
Ray bans, I zap you.
I pac macs you gonna meet the millers.
Sirens on the scene ho.
Police ask me who the killa?
I laugh and I say I don't know.
Cause this warfare no guerrilla.
Chilling at my crib trying plan out a robbery.
I don't trust no one so be careful if you follow me.
Model chicks massaging me.
They know I am the prodigy.
Asking for the wood log cabin like I'm lodging G.
I'll jump you but don't ollie me.
Green stacks like broccoli.
No one can do it better 4 letters SEKC.
