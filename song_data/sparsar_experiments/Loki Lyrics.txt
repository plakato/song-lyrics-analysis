Loki Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


Bounce.
Bounce.
Bounce.
Yea.

Feelin' on her while I'm subtweeting you.
Composing in your name when there's nothing to do.
I have more thoughts about you than i have feelings for her.
I mean i like her, i do, but in spurts.
Winter approaches and i hear it'll be a long one.
I'm praying i spend it with you.
And not the wrong one.
I got a lotta work to do up until then.
Nobody's ever won in this position.
Let the games begin.
Wheat timbs, military green flannel.
I just think my outfit's wavy, i don't mean to ramble.
Date night, scoop her up in the carriage.
She look delicious in that velvet skirt she snuck by her parents.
I like the way she put together.
I feel like she wants it.
Evening in the city with me got her running like a faucet.
Between the pauses in the talking you come into focus.
She want it all, but I'm too busy daydreaming to notice.
I'm thinking yo.

If they only knew.
Got my hands on her.
And my mind on you.
All eyes on me.
Lies gettin' obese.
But i gotta keep you close.
So i keep it lowkey.
So i keep it lowkey.

The repercussions of me coming clean are catastrophic.
But f*ck I'm supposed to do.
Take this all the way to the coffin?
If you want honesty i'll give it to you so good, so good.
You just gotta ask me to break you off, ma.
When I'm with a girl.
I'm wishing you would hit me with an emergency to come get you or something.
People chirpin' like they got me all figured out or something.
I just hope they never find out what they already know.
So I'm like yo....

If they only knew.
Got my hands on her.
And my mind on you.
All eyes on me.
Lies gettin' obese.
But i gotta keep you close.
So i keep it lowkey.
So i keep it lowkey.

I know how to treat you.
I know how much space to leave you.
I know how to freak you.
I know where to meet you.
I know how to love your features.
I know how you like it bumping outcha speakers.
I know not to put you on a pedestal or leak your secrets.
I know how you love it raining out.
I could pick your outfit out for you and we can wave it out.
I can inspire you.
We can take the town by storm.
You've barely scratched the surface of me.
But when you cut to the core?
It's just yo....

If they only knew.
Got my hands on her.
And my mind on you.
All eyes on me.
Lies gettin' obese.
But i gotta keep you close.
So i keep it lowkey.
So i keep it lowkey.

You deserve the best.
So when i look around at my competition I'm not impressed.
You're not a trophy to me to put on my mantle and boast about.
If you surrender to me we can pack it up.
And cash in both our phones and see what all that european coast is about.
I'm berry serious.
You do the cutest damn things sometimes and i hate it.
Just please....
Stay the f*ck from 'round me whenever I'm faded.
It's already tough as it is, man.
Yo....

If they only knew.
Got my hands on her.
And my mind on you.
All eyes on me.
Lies gettin' obese.
But i gotta keep you close.
So i keep it lowkey.
So i keep it lowkey.

Just for you.
