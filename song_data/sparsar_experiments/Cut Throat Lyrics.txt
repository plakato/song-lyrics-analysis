Cut Throat Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.


All my youngin's that's around me cut throat.
All my youngin's that's around me cut throat.
All my youngin's that's around me cut throat.
Fire from the barrel, I smell gun smoke.
B.S.M. you know them niggas gun tote.
Wooh Da Kid, you know that nigga cut throat.
Fire from the barrel, I smell gun smoke.
F.M.J., Wooh Da King is cut throat.

Riding with my homie, he ain't playing games.
A.K. 47, he just spraying things.
All my youngin's that's around me cut throat.
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, I smell gun smoke.
Wooh Da I'm a problem and they noticed it.
Problem for the game and I'm exposing shit.
Bullets got him ducking like he playing limbo.
Thirty round clip, I got that extendo.
Adios, that's my ad-lib's.
Three chains, Wooh Da King and a bad bitch.
All my youngin's that's around me T.T.G.
Trained to go, F.M.J., Wooh Da King a G.

B.S.M. my squad, all I need is them.
Money going in and out, like the A.T.M.
Out in the A them fuck boys don't play with him.
Wooh Da King like LeBron on a fucking rim.
No handouts, so I gotta take it all.
Roll the dice motherfucker, I'ma break 'em all.
Wooh Da I'm the kid, that's gon' get it done.
It's Mr. N.W.G., nigga with a gun.
No deal, whole floor deal like roadkill.
Tryna' take my style, bitch you on the wrong pill.
Red alert, my boys watching and they all alert.
Get you murked, whole top missing like a verte'.
