Wherever I go, they stare, bunch of Mona Lisas.
And I don't own no bitches if she moans Ima lease her.
Puke on a sentence sons a menace, I finish him.
Dreamin bout the 70's to live just like the hippies did.
Ill route 66 to quickly visit the Dixie chicks.
Shake the game up til it explode on some Pepsi shit.
Then ill ball so hard that my shows on ESPN.
When I finish ill live in Greenwich by 50's crib.
Vertigo flow got you Dizzy like Gillespie is.
On the low, though. this is all you niggas left me with?
Stairmaster shows, stayin 10 steps ahead of em.
Tell you I'm the nicest then I prove it like a veteran.
New Hampshire's sole representative.
They lookin out in Europe they wanna know where New England is.
OK, OK, I started out in Nashua.
No I ain't say Nashville, I'm drinkin in public I'm 21!
I be wildin in public, I'm 21.
I be sippin in public, 21.
Gettin live in the club cause Im 21.
Askin for ID and I love it I'm 21.
