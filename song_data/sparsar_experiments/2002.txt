Wherever I go, they stare bunch of Mona Lisas 
And. I don't own no bitches if she moans Ima lease her 
Puke on a sentence: sons a menace. I finish him 
Dreamin bout, the 70's to live just like the hippies did 
Ill route 66 to quickly visit the Dixie, chicks, 
Shake, the game up til. It explode on some Pepsi shit, 
Then ill ball, so hard that my shows on ESPN 
When. I finish ill live in Greenwich by 50's. Crib 
Vertigo flow got you Dizzy like Gillespie is 
On the low though.. This is all you niggas left me with 
Stairmaster shows stayin 10 steps ahead of em 
Tell, you I'm the nicest. Then I prove it like a veteran 
New Hampshire's sole representative 
They lookin out in Europe. They wan na know where New England is 
OK. Ok, I started out in Nashua 
No, I ain't say: Nashville, I'm drinkin in public, I'm 21 
I be wildin in public, I'm 21 
I be sippin in public 21. 
Gettin live in the club, cause Im 21 
Askin for ID, and I love it. I'M 21
