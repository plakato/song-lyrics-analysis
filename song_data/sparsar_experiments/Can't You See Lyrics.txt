Can't You See Lyrics
by Women.

Waiting for the night.
Feelings blind air.
Can't you see.
Can't you see.
Not so sure that I've seen this face before.
Can't you see.
Can't you see all.
The beaten chill of fright.
Take fault and rust.
Told us the wrong way out.
Hop to the town.
Want to make a pass.
Want to starve and.
Can't you see.
Can't you see.
Not so sure that I've seen this face before.
Can't you see.
Can't you see all.
I spill the public strain.
Take fault and rust.
The beaten chill of fright.
Hop to the town.
