Game Of Love Lyrics
by Xperience.

It?s just one year ago.
That i?ve met you at a show.
You were the clown.
I was the fool.
Right now it?s vice versa.
And i know it?s just because.
You?ve always been.
The fool for me.
Do we feel the same way.
Or do want to play the game of love.
On and on.
You took me to a bar.
To tell me who you are.
You never know.
What you want.
And you want me for good.
Just if you?re in the mood.
To spend the next.
Night with me.
