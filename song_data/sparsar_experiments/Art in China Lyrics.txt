Art in China Lyrics
by Yung Neptune (AKA YUNG JZ7).

Continuous I'm frivolous.
Boisterous catch her moist.
Hoyden tighter than short wound.
Nodes of odin. Knockin rock annoying.
Sweaters loud like the kush.
Kash carryin girls.
Meant for burying. my hobby.
Is a hairy trick nimble.
Rick roller stealing baby strollers.
And droppin off the load.

She bop me squattin.
Rockin on her toes.
Pull out on her nose.
She can smell my.
Descendants, open wide.
Eat my kids, yr lips is.
Where I end it.
