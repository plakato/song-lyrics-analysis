Alright With Me Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


No matter what I tell them.
Seems I always end up misunderstood.
No matter my intention.
All they gotta say is I'm up to no good.
I ain't even mad.
Why would I be mad?
It's all alright.
It's all alright with me.

The kids don't wanna turn down.
They with a bad chick hoping she ain't fertile.
I got two kids, maybe I'm the third child.
I just put the work in, hoping that it works out.
See, I got two bitches at the same time, I know.
She just drop it down till she can't go low.
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, I'll throw up.
When I drop Growing Over Life, I'll grow up.
Say they got ice but it must be Carte D'Or.
When you're living sky high, you design your own floors.
Running by my ride, holding on the car door.
Slip it into gear five, why I got the Porsche for.
Rappers sold less, claiming that they know more.
Did their core fanbase even want an encore?
I had a Cuban link, had to take my chain off.
She be looking at me funny every time I take off, ayy.

No matter what I tell them.
Seems I always end up misunderstood.
No matter my intention.
All they gotta say is I'm up to no good.
I ain't even mad.
Why would I be mad?
It's all alright.
It's all alright with me.

The kids don't wanna work now.
The student loan got them feeling it will work out.
They even told me on the low they prefer it loud.
They just turn up till they're floating with them fur clouds.
See, my niece is on fleek and in love with coco.
But four years ago she was singing Don't Go.
She says she wants a watch from her favourite uncle.
Michael Kors let the G-Shock, where'd the time go?
Had to ask if she knows something I don't.
Had the longest conversation on the shortest drive home.
Said she sees what I'm saying, staring in her iPhone.
Guess she didn't get the message but there weren't a typo.
Lord-a-mercy, you see the god in me?
That'll probably never let me fly economy.
I never had a better dream when I was asleep.
I guess the Ox in me really wants to top the league.
I'mma keep gunning, keep gunning.

No matter what I tell them.
Seems I always end up misunderstood.
No matter my intention.
All they gotta say is I'm up to no good.
I ain't even mad.
Why would I be mad?
It's all alright.
It's all alright with me.

Every day I make a prayer.
Lord, make sure I'm way up.
I'mma make my own way up.
No sleep, I'mma stay up.
Every day I make a prayer.
Lord, make sure I'm way up.
I'mma make my own way up.
No sleep, I'mma stay up.

prgrshn, _Wretch 32_ &amp; **Anne-Marie**.
Stack to the clouds.
On the pennies, we look down.
But the pennies make pounds, what do you want now?
_But the pennies make pounds, what do you want now?_.
We all want bags to be loud.
Don't let 'em make a sound.
But don't drink water till the well runs out.
_But don't drink water till the well runs out_.
Place to sleep so we're alright.
Food to eat so we're alright.
**Alright, it's alright.
Alright, it's alright**.
Family tree so we're alright.
Bun the weed so we're alright.
**Alright, it's alright.
Alright, it's alright with me**.
