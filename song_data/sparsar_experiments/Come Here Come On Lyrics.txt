Come Here Come On Lyrics
by Ruse.

Oh no oh no you just can't hide your surprise.
When I tell you.
Oh no oh no you just can't pretend it's alright when I ask you.
Come here c'mon and take it away.
Come here if you've got nothing to say.
Come here I'll make you afraid.
I don't want to find another you.
I don't want to find another you.
Oh no no.
It's no surprise.
Open your eyes.
Feel the abuse.
All the temptations.
All the sensations.
Give me some truth.
Come here c'mon and take it away.
Come here if you've got nothing to say.
Come here I'll make you afraid.
I don't want to find another you.
I don't want to find another you.
Breaking in two is so hard to do.
But easier than to return again.
I don't want to find another you.
I don't want to find another you.
