Sweet Home Alabama Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.


Big wheels keep on turning.
Carry me home to see my kin.
Singing songs about the Southland.
I miss Alabamy once again.
And I think its a sin, yes.

Well I heard mister Young sing about her.
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down.
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember.
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow.

Sweet home Alabama.
Where the skies are so blue.
Sweet Home Alabama.
Lord, I'm coming home to you.

In Birmingham they love the governor,.
Now we all did what we could do.
Now Watergate does not bother me.
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth.

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers.
And they've been known to pick a song or two.
Lord they get me off so much.
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue.
Now how about you?

Lordy!
Lord, I'm coming home to you.
Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer.
