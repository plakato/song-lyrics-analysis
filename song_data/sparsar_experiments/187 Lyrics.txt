187 Lyrics
by Tyga.


T-Raw's, rock my own kick game.
8 figure deal how I'm court-side at Clip game.
Still pop ace king shit I'm with Ros√©.
Black Maybach leather gloves on that OJ.
OK the day you beating me bitch no day.
Bandz A Make Her Dance, that's thousand dollar.
foreplay.
AK get a full clip not a sound wave.
You kissed her in her mouth, ask her how my dick taste.
Bitch nigga you don't want no drama I'm worth a couple commas.
It's death before dishonor.
Last king come sign up all my shit be.

Extraordinary rhymer I bodied yo' shit for.

West up, hot temper.
Get wet up she give me head not neck up.
She clean the mess up.
One false move death from gesture.
Cash in the safe I don't feel no pressure.

Cuz it's 187 how I'm killing these hoes.

Shit.
She fuck hermes and the hustle.
Crown on the watch she got niggas still thuggin'.
8.7 on the crib so fuck it.
Went gold in a month so it ain't no budget.
New chains, rollex links.
New chick just to drag my mink.
New car just to ride around here.
Aviator crew we flyest 'round here.
Hating on hood niggas dying 'round here.
Bath Salt Boss, got insurance on the beard.
Cars rockstar dope boys at odds.
I done seen it all but it's back to these broads'.
Hands clap like a nigga in the stadium.
Million dollar chain but I'm rocking 8 of 'em.
I see you sleeping boy don't make me pick your label up.
Scottie Pippen on the dribble I just laid 'em.

Another triple got me tripping like it's angel.

Off topic, get on top it wish us some absence.
So Sincere in her Belly, that's that Nas shit.
King announcing that gangsta shit we mobbin'.
We taking your dollars creflo no white collar.
