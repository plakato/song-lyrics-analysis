Am I Confused Lyrics
by Quasimoto.


Yo living in these times of life is getting hectic.
We got to find a method to survive the head trips.
I wonder every day if this is how it was meant to be.
Looking at society, police always eying me.
Plus my girlfriend keeps trying me.
She thinks she can buy me.
To cover up the mind see.
Pretty soon she's gonna be crying see.
When I have to tell her about these kids on the way from these other broads.

Shit's about to get odd.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Some make more than others.
A statistic like crackhead mothers.
? in the gutters.
Drinking nightrain pumping.
needles in their veins.
Trying to maintain while the rich weight game.
The situation's from taking the wrong path.
It'll lead you to your doom from not doing the math.
Am I confused or.

Interlude.

Yo nigga used to be a breakdancer.
But now he's lying up dying of cancer.
Doctors can't find the answer.
He used to smoke mad cigarettes.
Nigga get like three packs a day and straight smoke em away.
Now he gotta pay run away to go out.
Wasn't about the game on the ? getting the ho out.
The sister copped AIDS from going raw skin.
She still hoin' the pastor monk's men.
Lookin' all fly but you can't tell from the size of the thighs.
Waiting for you is a deadly surprise.
My niggas ain't listening still.
Cause y'all blinded.
You got your mind washed.
Always thinkin' one-sided.
Am I confused or.
