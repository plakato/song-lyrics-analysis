Onyx And Dmx Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.

F/ dmx, Onyx.

Sway &amp; King Tech.
Revolution on the ones and twos.
Come on let's do this.
Onyx, dmx on the Wakeup Show.
Come on.

Sonsee.
Word up, we in the zone yo.
O-N-Y-X, dmx.
Word up we bout' to flex.
Sonsee yo, yo, yo.
Verbally shot down, beat up, burnt up and sizzled.
I rock microphones, ya know it's me I shoot like missle.
Freestyle, meanwhile we in L. A.
No doubt kid, hit em' in the place.
If he get too fly, yes yes y'all.
Ya comin' down, we gon' bring down the wall.

Fredro Starr.
Yo wake up, time to break up what what.
Since you last in the cut raise it up.
No doubt, blow em' all out.
Official now, sinkin' em' out, it's all bounce.
Shake for ya head to leave you headless.
Eyes with redness.
Spray rap cats with burnin' lead tips.
Point blank range, take aim.
Blow ya brain out the frame.
Out to touch, spit this musical structure.
Yo, yo this is a lyrical destructure.
Path of disaster breaks mass.
Comin' at ya from blasts.
Catch ya, caught ya last.
Huff like asthma.
I couldn't care less.
You approachin' they death.
My own lyric politic with the feelings.
The devil himself, revel in himself.
Shots in America.
Assassinate ya character.
Slaughter ya.
Twenty-one holes in ya Nautica.
What, what, what.
Yo, yo, yo.

Sway &amp; King Tech.
Dmx, dmx, dmx.

Dmx.
Uh, check it out y'all.
Check it out, check it out, check it out y'all.
Check it out y'all, check it out y'all.
Check it, check it, check it, check it.
I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with the gift.
I'm the best so unless you wanna mess with the stiff.
Don't touch that, uh-uh leave it alone.
When you walk past the doghouse leave it a bone.
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs light.
Scratch, shake and hold all night.
So when you hear that arf-arf start runnin'.
Cause when ya hear that arf-arf I'm comin'.
I don't like drama so I stay to myself.
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth.
I want the money, give me the honies with big asses.
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses.
First I'ma bash his head wide open.
Beggin' me to stop but at least he's wise open.
Didn't gethis wish now he's a dish for the pack.
Two glowin' red eyes, everything else black.

Sticky Fingaz.
Yeah and that's dmx, know what I'm sayin'.
Official yes, official yes yo.
Now Sticky Fingaz mad man, tear down stages.
Ain't nobody dead or alive can get with me and my rages.
Throw a clip in the gat, I'm sick of the yap.
I'm ready to bust a cap, it can happen.
And killas will get hit that's a rappin'.
My itch, will cap you up and get you blasted.
Closed casket, I'm the bald-headed bastard.
Black dust gave me black lungs, I pack guns.
I'm used to action like doctor bullets reaction.
Blaze the mack ten, show gun.
I can spot the sheisty villains.
Cause it takes one to know one.
Remove my mask and reveal myself.
If I was you, yo I would kill myself.

Sonsee.
Hey yo, I got this date.
Full swing mic attackin'.
Makin' big stackin'.
My brain is always packin' a plan.
To be pursuin' newer things that I'm doin'.
Hit ya with the zing.
Bada-boom bada-bing.
Spine is tingling.
Ring it up at ya register.
Sweat you can edit mister ding ding.
Come out fightin' recitin'.
What I'm writin' for ya uh like it.
Cause I'm a supremecist, grimicin' the menace.
The optimistic, pessimistic, guess the rest of it.
