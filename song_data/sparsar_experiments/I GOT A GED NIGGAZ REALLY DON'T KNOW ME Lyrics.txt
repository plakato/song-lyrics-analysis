I GOT A GED NIGGAZ REALLY DON'T KNOW ME Lyrics
by Yung Sizzle.

What up, bitch ass niggas?
Yung Sizzle is back, motherfucker, I got a GED.
So fuck with me.
Fuck with your nigga.
Atomic Sonics, nigga, Yung Sizzle nigga, we back.

I got a GED.
Niggas really don't know me.
I got a GED.
Niggas really don't know me.
I got a GED.
Niggas really don't know me.
I got a GED.
Niggas really don't know me.

Coming up out of the pink of a toothless bitch.
I knew my destiny was to spit.
Park in the lot across from your ass.
Who's under the scope?
That's my new bitch, and your old bitch.
Making cheesesticks for me.
She suck my big dick.
That trill shit, you niggas know.
If you don't know me, I'll fuck a nigga's hoe.
But niggas don't know me.
Niggas don't know me.
Niggas don't know me, niggas don't know me.
Niggas don't know me.
Niggas don't know me, niggas don't know me.
Niggas don't know me.
Niggas don't owe me shit.
Nigga don't know me.
But I got a GED, I got it.

Fuck a nigga's hoe on a daily basis.
Sizzle Was Here on all they faces.
White writing drip like the shit in vases.
Gold tips on my teeth like my fucking laces.
All the niggas I teached, all the bitches I leached.
Shit, I'm losing the count.
All the dirt that I did has led me to have a big ass amount.
Leaving you dead in the dirt.
Put my hand up in her skirt, she went into mine.
Got no time to flirt.
She gives head like Kurt, and ended up eating yogurt.
I gave her the work, she returned my balls.
I'm disappearing my dick in her walls.
Slipping my tip up into the bando.
And I'm in space, nigga, like I'm Lando.
My face iconic, I'm sexy like whoa!
Wanime niggas pronounce it as mo.
Show yourself to the do', show yourself to the do'.
I'm finna drown, my condo is filled with pussy that's indigo.
Damn, I got so many hoes.
They all belong to a nigga, though.
I got a bigger dick, though.

You got a PhD, Magna Cum Laude.
But your nigga love me with a GED.
