Statik Selektah’s “Bird's Eye View” Lyrics

Produced by Statik Selektah.

I want you to tell them.
Statik Selektah.

Lets do this man for real.
We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us.
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush.
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush.
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust.
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust.
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust.
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic.
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted.
Sports cars, reendorsed yards.
Everybody four stars, Rae like forty, jewelry gaudy.
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me.
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely.
Hanging around the vets in the sweats.
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra.
Fuck around a hundred Tecs flash.
Flex, cash, drugs, money and sex.
Dumb check smashing.

Watching the game from a bird's eye view.
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew.
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking.
Hoping my best buds ain't only in it for the tokens.
Cause they say it's who you joking with, tokin' potent with.
Tag team and strokin' chicks, the ones that do some bogus shit.
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip.
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch.
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is.
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is.
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit.
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top.
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history.
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily.
Laughing with a fan like.

It's the elephant in the room.
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon.
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb.
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon.
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising.
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is.
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's.
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is.
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude.
I am the living definition of improving the groove.
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used.
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes.
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you.
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you.
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble.
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double.
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you.
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you.
The most notorious, Poet Laureate.
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors.
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-.
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod.
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are.
Imposters, long drawn out process.
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience.
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on.
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny.
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me.
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over.
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus.
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus.
Naw, I'm on your block with Somali pirates.

For real man Statik man, Whats good?
Yeah you know I gets it on.
I ain't playin', i'm truly the worst.
I was born about that.

…Represent me.
