Hammerhead Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: IHooray! It's a Deathtrip.
Hammerhead.
In another time and space.
I'm awaiting the awakening of day.
Going far beyond the sun.
Cause nothing is really what it seems.
In a room within a room.
Where I go to see the setting sun.
In a room within a room.
Hammerhead.
Do you understand.
Yeah the deeds of man.
Worship you my hammerhead.
Let me stay inside your womb.
Time is no more, evolution is for fools.
Should have told me long ago.
What's right is wrong but yesterday is gone.
Room within a room.
Where I go to see the setting sun.
In a room within a room.
Hammerhead.
Do you understand.
Yeah the deeds of man.
Worship you my hammerhead.
I am standing on the outside looking in.
Searching for the end to find where to begin.
Doesn't matter what you do when evolution fails.
To make you understand, I sure don't understand.
