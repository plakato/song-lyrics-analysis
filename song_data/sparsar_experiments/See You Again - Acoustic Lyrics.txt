See You Again - Acoustic Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

It's been a long day without you, my friend.
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again.
We've come a long way from where we began.
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again.
When I see you again.

Man, who knew?
All the planes we flew.
Good things we've been through.
That I'll be standing here talking to you.
About another path.
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh.
But something told me that it wouldn't last.
Had to switch up.
Look at things different see the bigger picture.
Those were the days.
Hard work forever pays.
And now I see you in a better place.

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side.
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride.

It's been a long day without you, my friend.
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again.
We've come a long way from where we began.
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again.
When I see you again.

First you both go out your way.
And the vibe is feeling strong.
And what's small turn to a friendship.
A friendship turn into a bond.
And that bond will never be broken.
And the love will never get lost.
And when brotherhood come first.
Then the line will never be crossed.
Established it on our own.
When that line had to be drawn.
And that line is what we reach.
So remember me when I'm gone.

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side.
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride.

It's been a long day without you, my friend.
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again.
We've come a long way from where we began.
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again.
When I see you again.
