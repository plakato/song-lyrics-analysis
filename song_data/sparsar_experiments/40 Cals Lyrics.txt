From my calibar, carrry the, comp to the hospital.
When he date your calendars, flip it on y'all who copy cal.
Watch me now, rock the crown, now one.
Smooth like the lotion, you miss me when cal gone.
It's the set, you know we real, my weapons only steel.
Cause like Evander we give niggas the Holyfield.
I told G chill but he had to go.
So I grip the calico, let the shit.
blow like calidro.
The 40 cali go, hard like calculus.
Your boy carry burners so large I get calluses.
So pass the calamine, this ain't a battle rhyme.
Your moms put my name on her behind like Calvin Klein.
For the thousandth time you see cal spitting.
Why these juniors after my name like Cal Ripken.
From, California, the cal-cutter.
I got that dust called tical you gotta say my style butter.
Brown color, the white like calcium.
Niggas tryin to scheme on my brothers, but cal see them.
Be on the ground leaking, your bowels and guts.
Will be the same dude speaking, like Calvin Butt.
Who be at his wake, preacher Reverend Calvin Butt.
You a G cause you touched for a thousand bucks, WHAT!
Call me Calhoun, with the ex-caliber.
Think the pen almighty than the sword then I challenger.
Cause off the calendar I'm calling out haters.
Cause I Bomb up your turf, call me 40 cal-qaeda.
To calculate mine you need four calculaters.
I get money for real word to my daughter Calasia.
I'm, so lyri-cal, y'all is spiri-cal.
Well I'm raping the track, you can call me Mr. Cal.
Or Mysti-cal, with that cha cha bow.
