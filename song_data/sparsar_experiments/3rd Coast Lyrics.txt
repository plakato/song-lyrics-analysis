by Z-Ro.


Yeah sup Ro sup Grace it's your boy Den Den 
To jump on this track with you boys. You know I'm tal'n bout 
It's all about the 3rd baby 3rd coast yeah. I got this 
 
Den Den 
See, I'm mentally ready, fuck. Those is testing me. 
Progress is so sweet ain't tripping with envy 
Slip and slide like a snake vibrate the world like a quake, 
Mashing hard on the gas with 3rd Coast on the plate, 
Roll on cowards and busters peeping them soldiers and hustlers 
Got, an eye for them. Fuckers that trying P.H. with snorkels 
Got a trunk full of clutches blinding mine, make you stutter 
I blow like a hurricane, so close all your shutters 
See. I wants everything and everything. I'M gone have 
Roll out my red carpet just to go to my stash 
Third coast, blinding and shining like a brand new slab 
On, my birthday, I'm throwing me a fortune life bash, 
 
If you living shife, don't fuck with 3rd Coast. 
These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast. These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast. 
You could lose your life, don't fuck with 3rd Coast, 
These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast. These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast, 
 
Grace 
This. How we ride in 3rd po' up syrup blow herb 
From lane to lane we grip the grain and 20's chop up the curb 
We popping flippers on sippers 3rd Coast, g's on the rise, 
With bubble eyes and customized and chrome be 20 inches wide 
Entertainment center be Lit up and all the trunks gone, lift up, 
Button rims they rip up down. Talkers mouths gone zip up 
It's that time - and here we come 3rd Coast, take a stand. 
We drew it up and screwed them up proceeded through with the plan 
Jumped in the mix. With hundred bricks and now a mobbing gorilla, 
Unanimous go-getter about the scrilla, my nigga 
Stay loaded up and we ready Box City working that jelly 
Burning more streets than Perelli while cutting up like machetes 
No, doubt screwed up, candy paint killer, think straight drink 
Down. Here we swinging the tank and every thought be bout. Bank 
I'ma be T from the S.U.C. pay. Dues got stripes that be ranks 
That boy, G-R-A-C-E 3rd Coast, born caught off game

These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast. These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast.

I done took a lot of losses now it's time to win, 
No, more signing, dotted lines and I stay dollars. Spend 
I want convertible Benz with the blue bubble lens 
I'm worth a million off the corner. When I'm pimping, my pen, 
Blue over gray, is my choice. Pearl white Rolls Royce 
Don't need no natural lemon tea. I don't be training my voice, 
I'm signed thoed by nature, suckers, punchers, simps and fakers. 
A click full of back breakers and more in a Studebaker 
The Mo City Don. I wave a truck like it's a wand 
Hit. The ATM machine. Ain'T no need for me to pawn 
Cause, I'm paid my game sharper than a razor blade, 
Bald faded and X-rated. The Gucci's is tailor made 
I bubble in the sauna, as I smoke marijuana, 
From Daytona to Arizona no longer on the corner. 
World wide I got ta keep the dream alive. 
2Pac and Biggie done died. So now they ready for the Southside 
Top dropping body rocking like Fat, Pat 
Dirty rats get splat. When I pull out my black Mack 
Cause, it's over the fat lady done sung the song 
From California, to Rome. These hoes pussies stay warm 
And on to the Alamo Dome, then right back home 
Ain't, no regular, we hydro'd as 4-54 
On the po's be spinning flipping with yellow boned women 
Swimming in divid-ends cause I'm cold with my pimping, 
 
If you living shife, don't fuck with 3Rd Coast, 
These niggas, can't fade 3rd Coast. These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast. 
You could lose your life, don't fuck with 3rd Coast, 
These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast. These niggas can't fade 3rd Coast
