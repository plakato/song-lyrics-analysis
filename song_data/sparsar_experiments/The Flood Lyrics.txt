The Flood Lyrics
by The Swellers.

The flood carries us away.
I'll hold my breath for other days.

I won't make this wager, where's the light for me.
Now that you've raised the stakes?
And they're always waiting. Fuck waiting!
My hands are surface bound.
The rest stays under water.

The flood carries us away.
I'll hold my breath for other days.
And when I hear that voice and everything's okay.
Then I'll pray the world my soul to take.

With my philosophy expelled, it'd take a saint to give me hell.
And I don't know what's real.
I'm deteriorating, the most hated.
Drown without a sound.
True hearts and minds are sinking.

The flood carries us away.
I'll hold my breath for other days.
And when I hear that voice and everything's okay.
Then I'll pray the world my soul to take.

Suddenly, it hits me that there's something out there for us.
But I can't breathe, and I can't shake this sick feeling. I'm half alive.
Suddenly, it hits me; a feeling I've never known.

The flood carries us away.
I'll hold my breath for other days.
And when I hear that voice and everything's okay.
Then I'll pray the world my soul to take.
Then I'll pray the world my soul to take.
