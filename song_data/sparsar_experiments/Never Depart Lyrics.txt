Never Depart Lyrics
by Xander Ghost.


Can you take her away from me?
You know I'm the worst â€˜round that league.
The blond beach, but she been long in life.
But she will fall back in line.
I know, I know, I know.
Go and see your life.
I miss her like the water flies.

She said she wanted all or nothing.
I get it if ? your wrong.
Cause I miss with all your thoughts.
Because she settled for so long.
But I didn't see that blow.
We have a hope in my heart.
That you will never depart.
You will never depart.
You will never depart.
You will never depart.
Never depart.

I don't it small.
I love by the kilo.
But now that you're gone.
And you were wrong.
The ? so let's go.
Let it go.

She said she wanted all or nothing.
I get it if ? your wrong.
Cause I miss with all your thoughts.
Because she settled for so long.
But I didn't see that blow.
We have a hope in my heart.
That you will never depart.
You will never depart.
You will never depart.
You will never depart.
Will never.
