The Scene Is Dying Lyrics
by X Blake Freeman X.


She graduated with honors, headed up to UT.
Dorm room after hours, tripod makin' movies.
I think her dad's in real estate, mommy's just a cutie.
Never say I miss her  she's always right next to me.
I'm in a Minnie Mouse hat, treat love is like a Disney movie.
She's in a Mickey.
snapback, Chanel.
shoes, and brown.
Louie.
She ain't really Scene, but I make her though.
She needs a makeover so I take this girl home.
Now she's super Scene with them neon skinnies on.
Hair teased up.
and Hello Kitty.
on her phone.
I like her more this way, but who's to say:.
â€˜'Scene kids just don't exist today!''.

The Scene is dying I wanna bring it back.
So I threw some beast lyrics on a real sick track.
And I took some Scene pics for a Scene video.
And spreaded it around like a Facebook Ho.

The Scene is dying I wanna bring it back.
So I threw some beast lyrics on a real sick track.
And I took some Scene pics for a Scene video.
And spreaded it around like a Facebook Ho.

Shout out to my kids that always make a scene.
Never change for no one, be who they wanna be.
I can be your influence take notice of me.
I'm known across the world: ''Internet Popularity''.
And you can do the same, just promote your name.
Play your cards right and be accepted in this game.
Life is a gamble and that goes for fame.
But never try equals never anything.
So please little kiddies take my advice.
Do what makes you happy and set your mind right.
If dressing kind of crazy defines you every night.
There's million of us, we embrace you alright.

The Scene is dying I wanna bring it back.
So I threw some beast lyrics on a real sick track.
And I took some Scene pics for a Scene video.
And spreaded it around like a Facebook Ho.

The Scene is dying I wanna bring it back.
So I threw some beast lyrics on a real sick track.
And I took some Scene pics for a Scene video.
And spreaded it around like a Facebook Ho.
