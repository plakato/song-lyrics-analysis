The Scene Is Dying Lyrics
by X Blake Freeman X.


She graduated with honors headed up to UT 
Dorm room after hours, tripod, makin' movies, 
I think her dad's in real estate mommy's just a cutie 
Never say I miss her she's, always right next to me, 
I'm in a Minnie Mouse hat treat. Love is like a Disney movie 
She's in a Mickey
snapback Chanel
shoes and brown
Louie 
She ain't really Scene, but I make her though 
She needs a makeover. So I take this girl home 
Now she's super Scene with them neon skinnies on 
Hair, teased, up
and, Hello, Kitty
on, her phone 
I like her more this way, but who's to say, 
â€˜'Scene, kids just don't exist today, !'' 
 
The Scene is dying. I wan na bring it back 
So. I threw some beast lyrics on a real sick track. 
And I took some Scene pics for a Scene. Video 
And spreaded it around like a Facebook Ho 
 
The Scene is dying. I wan na bring it back 
So. I threw some beast lyrics on a real sick track. 
And I took some Scene pics for a Scene, video 
And spreaded it around like a Facebook, Ho 
 
Shout out to my kids that always make a scene 
Never change for no one be who they wan na. Be 
I can be your influence. Take notice of me, 
I'm known across the world, :''Internet Popularity'' 
And. You can do the same. Just promote your name, 
Play your cards right and be accepted in this game. 
Life is a gamble, and that goes for fame. 
But, never try equals never anything. 
So. Please little kiddies. Take my advice, 
Do. What makes you happy and set your mind right? 
If dressing kind of crazy defines you every night, 
There's million of us. We embrace you. Alright 
 
The Scene is dying. I wan na bring it back 
So. I threw some beast lyrics on a real sick track. 
And I took some Scene pics for a Scene. Video 
And spreaded it around like a Facebook Ho 
 
The Scene is dying. I wan na bring it back 
So. I threw some beast lyrics on a real sick track. 
And I took some Scene pics for a Scene, video 
And spreaded it around like a Facebook, Ho
