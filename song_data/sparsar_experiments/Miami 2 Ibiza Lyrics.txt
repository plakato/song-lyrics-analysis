Miami 2 Ibiza Lyrics
by Swedish House Mafia.

Swedish House Mafia.
She says she likes my watch, but she wants Steve's AP.
And she stay up all hours watching QVC.
She said she loves my songs, she bought my MP3.
And so I put her number in my Bold BB.

I got a black BM, she got a white TT.
She wanna see what's hiding in my CK briefs.
I tell her wear suspenders and some PVC.
And then I'll film it all up on my JVC.

Uh, scene one. Everybody get in your positions.
Pay attention, and listen.
We're tryna get this in one take.
So let's try and make that happen.
Take one, action!

She pose for FHM, she like my Black LV.
We spinnin' LPR, up on my APC.
I'm in my PRPS and my Nike SB's.
Ravin' with SHM, London to NYC.

I got my Visa and my Visa.
A diva and her dealer.
Bitch I'm up on the guest list.
With the Swedish House Mafia.

You can find me on a table.
Full of vodka and tequila.
Surrounded by some bunnies.
And it ain't fucking Easter.

I wake up in the morning.
With a mild case of amnesia.
With a girl that like a girl.
Like Lindsey Lohan, Queen Latifah.

If you niggas are pullin'.
Then boy I must be FIFA.
And that's standard procedure from Miami 2 Ibiza.
