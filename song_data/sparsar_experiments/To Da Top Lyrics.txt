To Da Top.

Y'all already know that i be killing.
On mics i be ripping.
Bad bitches i be hitting.
And my diamonds they be chilling.
Uh.
Real nigga i been one.
Real niggas never seen none.
Opps they be lacking so nigga i gotta give em some.
Yeahh.
I be going all the way.
Struggled now i have a way.
In the booth.
Spitting the truth.
See the target imma shoot.
Cause im shooting and im scoring.
I wake up every morning.
Gotta get this money while y'all niggas still snoring.
I was just fed up.
So i had to get up.
Couldn't led up.
Shit was tough.
Now its fucken rough.
Started for reason.
Money is what i needed.
Niggas change like seasons.
Victorious, never beaten.
And imma few steps away.
Lames stay away.
Going hard niggas, so its fuck you what you say.
To the top.

I had nothing.
Now im stunning.
Put words together and started busting.
Fuck niggas they be hating.
But they my motivation.
Niggas doing life.
Cause fuck niggas want the price.
They be snitching all the time.
I ask myself why?
And Remember those day where i couldn't get by.......
Uuhh.
And Niggas talk shit.
So i have to leave em quick.
With the clip.
Spray, he flip.
ATM thats my clique.
And they be hard like a brick.
.............
