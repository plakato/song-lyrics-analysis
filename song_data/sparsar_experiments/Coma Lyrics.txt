Coma Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Machines that make me breathe, I just can't stand their terrible scream.
I'm stumbling through smoke-filled rooms.
With only darkness ahead, I wish I was dead.
Drowned in a distance, I'm so safe and sound.
Damn well protected from all those around.
Seeking the life that was taken from me.
Still all I see is a man on his knees.
Although I'm asleep, can you feel I'm here?
Lost in this place, screaming for you.
Back on my feet when a distant light.
Brings me some hope and a strength that had died.
A doorway that speaks of the world I once left.
A final way out and a final way back.
Then a sudden change makes the light start to fade.
I need to run but I stumble instead.
The light disappears as I lay on the ground.
My last hope of freedom is turned into none....
Will I ever speak again, love again?
Will I ever leave my mind?
I am trapped inside myself, far from the outside.
Why won't they let me die?
I'm tired as I lay here bleeding on the ground.
Breathe.

Breathe.
Here I am, I'm lost in this place.
Wish I could just say goodbye.
But you're not around to hear my cries....
Will I ever speak again, love again?
Will I ever leave my mind?
I am trapped inside myself, far from the outside.
Why won't they just let me die?
Die.
