Pluto Lyrics
by Work Drugz.


Smoke rings it's a smooth attack.
I guess we'll never make it back.
Stand up and come along with me.
The beat takes, 1, 2, 3.
Staring out the window reasons aside.
We're never gonna make it alive.
Speeds cold but these hands are warm.
Light speed will keep us hanging on.

We're just two deep space lovers.
And this feels alright.
Zero gravity high in the cold sunlight.
We're just two deep space lovers.
And this feel alright.
Zero gravity high, zero gravity.

Now the years, they're rolling on.
Moonlight fades into one.
Can't remember if the Earth survives.
Blinking lights in every single size.
Twinkle twinkle on all the stars.
Just make a wish and I won't be so far.
Sky's the limit, so close your eyes.
Space is dry, but you won't be tonight.

Zero gravity it's on and on.
And I want you to, I want you now.
I want you to look at you tonight.
