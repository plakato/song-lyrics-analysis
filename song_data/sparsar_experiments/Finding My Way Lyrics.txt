Finding My Way Lyrics
by 702.


I'm so glad see to you.
I can't believe what I've found.
Got yourself together, trying to move to a higher ground.
Now what have I been missing.
Besides from the fact that you're fine.
Into your mind, and all that comes with it.
So many feelings to deal with.

Where do we go from here.
Can we face our fear.
Into a love again, and remain friends.

I believe I wanna stay.
So once again I'll be finding my way.
Back to you.

That's just what it will be.
So won't you???? Right there.
And create a future.
Build a life that we can share.
That's what it's about.
So do you mind hangin' out.
Now till forever.
Somehow I know we'll end up together.
Oh, I wanna know.

I'll be finding my way.
