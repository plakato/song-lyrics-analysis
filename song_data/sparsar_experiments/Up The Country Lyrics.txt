Up The Country Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

It's all downhill from here.
So bottle up your fear.
Head's on a bit unsteady.
I think you'd better steer.

See, I'm north country bound.
Gone, but still renowned.
You may not see my face no more.
So keep my picture out.

Once there was a youth I led.
A fallacy I chased.
Got so used to them somehow.

But now there's criminals in mine.
Leading me to distress.
I'm so lost, I best not get found.

Though I'm much too weak to ride.
Watch these hills on glide.
Mama said I'm best off dead.
Lord knows how hard I tried.

Incase my skull with clouds.
Made my failure loud.
Heard a teardrop hit the ground.
Somewhere among the crowd.

But still I'm restless for the bed.
My tongue no longer tastes.
Oh, I'm dying and lay me down.

If there's someone in my steer.
Let him keep his place.
Not sure how I'll long I'll stick around.

There's a girl who knows my name.
How I wish I could explain.
Just tell her that she's at my side.
Though at hers I can't remain.

See, I've seen salvation's yard.
But every highwayman's been barred.
Some cheap box wine to ease my mind.
One, oh one's mighty hard.

But baby, babe come hold my hand.
There is no time to waste.
You know I think I'm sinking down.

But I doubt you've heard a word I said.
Or looked into my face.
Yes I'll see you next time around.
