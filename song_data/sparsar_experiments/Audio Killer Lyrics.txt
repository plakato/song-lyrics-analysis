Audio Killer Lyrics
by Ruslan.


Audio killer.

Audio killer.

Audio killer.

Audio killer.

Audio.

Got so much blood on my hands that my conscience stained.
These pages are evidence to confiscate.
The crowds gather 'round, wanna congregate.
They wanna hear me now and what it is that I can say.
To explain myself while I've been caught red handed.
But they slap me on the wrist like I'm Smoky and a Bandit.
Like I'm smoking in abandoned buildings.
I dismantled, set on fire, then I hitchhike cause I'm really left stranded,.
poor me.
My life's a OD.
My life's a high life, well you gots to know me.
I'm only so human, Skywalker hold me.
Down and don't forget who's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Pour me a drink, help me to think.
Show me what's phony the homies didn't offer going.
Escaped and the force is leading me to slaughter.
The brink, I can't kill this feeling any longer.

Audio killer.

Keep me in compact, keep me in contact.
I been killing before I had me a contract.

Never been half-stepping, plenty of ?
I be with monsters like Ash Ketchum, strapped all black weapon.
Flow so funky I should be giving them jazz lessons.
Letterman jacket I'm balling out on my class with it.
I hit the stage and move bodies like bad pivots.
Wicked.
Tell 'em hold up, Imma roll up.
With the homies, with soldiers.
We focused, I told ya.
We high off them dreams.
When I get tracks, I don't back track.
Got a few raps for the backpacks.
Get a click-clack, blat, blat, blat.
Then right off the scene.
Wait.
I'm so realer.
I grew up with bangers, pimps, and dope dealers.
I done traveled all around to give 'em something to hear.
I'm trying to tell you it's not a flow iller.
I'm a.

Audio killer.

I think they heard it cause I'm a versatile dude.

I'm so fortunate to be in his will, I don't spend nothing unless I'm.
purchasing a vowel fool.
Surfing through the crowd, searching every smile.
Burning every foe, mercenary down.
Churches where the sound booms.
Lurking in your town, verbally astound.
Working with the.
Blow your mind like the burner in your mouth.
I'm that dude that ?
Keep it cooler than your ventilation system.
They say that gambling against the Scripture.
When I spit it I can make the alphabet that Imma kill 'em.
If I give 'em a hand they gon' turn around put a nail through it.
So much fire, Hell owe me like Adele music.
Audio murderer get prepared for the funeral.
When I'm spitting all the children say ten, like Lucifer.
I'm a.

Audio killer.
