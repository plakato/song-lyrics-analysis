Decisions Lyrics

Strap-A-Holics with the Trap-A-Holics Wooh Da Kid Wooh Da King 
 
Decisions, We all make decisions 
Don't make the wrong move and get plucked like a pigeon 
You decide your fucking homicide 
If I catch a lil niggah trynna break into my ride. 
 
Decisions. We all make decisions. 
We all take positions. You a hero or a villain, 
You decide your fucking homicide. 
I hope he trained to go when I say it's time to ride. 
 
This niggah screamin' like hurry up it's time to go 
All. This talk at who got snaps on my packs row 
Niggah chill out, relax and enjoy the ride. 
Black car black niggahs, equal homicide, 
Now. We pull up to the house of a fuck niggah 
Sleeping on yah enemies. Got you touched niggah 
Don't make a sound 
We through the door. 
We kill this niggah take the cash we out the door 
My lil greedy ass homie, like I need more 
We, took the cash. What the fuck we need. The TV's for 
His lil shordy came shootin' through the closet, 
But, that's the decisions you make when you into robbin' 
 
Now back to the story: 
This bitch bussin' 
30 round clips squeezin', like it ain't nothin' 
I, look down my lil homie head split, 
The next thought. In my head, this a dead bitch 
I get low, thinkin' bout. My next move, 
I, don't care if its a chick yah, better, not snooze, 
Get revenge or leave. I gottah choose 
But, I'm ridin' for my niggah. That'S what homies do 
An. I already know Jay gone away: 
But, It gottah be done. She gon die today, 
Got her done, but the whole force outside 
I decide right now. Life or Homicide, 
 
I know it's on sweat, pourin' from my head 
But I gottah choose now or I'm fucking dead. 
I hear foot steps runnin' and they gettin' close 
I ain't diein' over bread. So I raised my toast 
Can't freeze up now or it's over with 
I'm a villain. So you know I'm on that murder shit 
Fate decide right now. What'S the outcome 
I think I chose death now, ask me: am I dumb
