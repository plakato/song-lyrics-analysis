Fall Again Lyrics
by Virtue.


Yes, I remember when i saw your face.
I felt all my life wrongs made right.
As soon as i gave into you.
I took one step you took two.
Yes, I called on you.
Every single day.
But then i started to lose my connection with you.
And nowconviction is so true.
That's why i'm running back to you.

Spirit will you fall again.
Make me over again.
I hear your voice so clear.
Will you please draw me near.
I'm Sowing.
Restore me.
Back to when i First believed.
Please Fall again on me.

No this ain't like me.
Thought I'd never leave you side.
But somehow guilt and shame destroyed my faith.
I thought this walk would be easy.
But the devil decieved me.
Now I learned the hard way there's no living life for me.
Now I see if there's no you there's no me.
So I'm calling you Jesus.
Please Rescue me.

The love I felt.
When I denied myself.
I do believe that you care bout me.
No I can't live without you.
No I won't live without you.
I need you to fall again.
