Steelo (J-Dub Mix Edit) Lyrics
by 702.

702: :.
Hmmm, come on,.
Yeah.

I'm gonna keep it real.
How you make me feel.
Boy you give me chills, baby.
I'm gonna break it down.
You just drive me wild.

Whenever you're around.

1 - You know how I do.
And you know how I flow.
Can I get your name and number.
Cuz I like your steelo.
And I dig the way you move.
And the way you do your thing.
Baby you can bring it on.
You can swing it this way.

Brad Dacus:.
Babygirl take a trip with me.
On an exotic fantasy.
I know your man will be mad.
If he knew I was the best you ever had.
On vacation, conversation is cool.
Let's take a swim in the pool.
Begin the romance, slow dance.
You know the circumstances.
Whisper in your ear.
Making advances, giving glances.
Picture this on the canvas.
Sipping on pina coladas.
On the beach in the Bahamas.
Away from all the drama.

2 - You stay on my mind.
Think about you all the time.
Got to get to know you well.
If you kiss then I won't tell.

Kiss me, oh, hold me, I say squeeze me, oh squeeze me, whoa.
Kiss me, oh, hold me, I say squeeze me, whoa, kiss me.

Missy:.

One two, uh check it, check it, check it out.
Follow, follow me, many, many, many miles.
One two, check it out.
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme break it down.

One two, check it out.
Follow, follow me, many, many, many miles.

One two break it down.
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, break it down.

This track is nasty like pornography.
Work the mommy I like Joe but he sloppy, dag.
Poppy got a brand new bag, for real.
I taking 'Quel O'neil like shaq, shak.
Ask Michael Jackson who bad.
He says I am but the queen not drag, dag.
I'm bad enough to let my pants sag.
I be in 'Vegas where 702 be at.
Check it out.

Brad Dacus:.
At sight it's visual.
Could it be physical attraction.
I hear you're diggin' my steelo so come show me some action.
What'cha gon' do, 702.
I guarantee you'll be loving me after I'm through.
Apparently you know what I'll do.
Get it, get it, let me hit it you don't stop.
We won't stop till I'm finished.
Babygirl it's your world.
I'll be your friend like those diamonds and pearls.

702:.

J-Dub:.
Remix, Noontime.
J-Dub, Dent, 26-20 crew.
See we out.

702:.
Kiss me, oh, hold me, I say squeeze me, oh squeeze me, whoa.
Kiss me,  oh, hold me, I say squeeze me,  whoa, Kiss me.
