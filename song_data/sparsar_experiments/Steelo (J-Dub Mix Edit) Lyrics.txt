702 
Hmmm come on 
Yeah 
 
I'm gon na keep it real 
How. You make me feel 
Boy. You give me chills baby 
I'm gon na break it down. 
You just drive me wild 
, 
Whenever you're around 
 
1. You know how I do 
And. You know how I flow 
Can. I get your name and number 
Cuz. I like your steelo 
And. I dig the way you move 
And. The way you do your thing, 
Baby you can bring it on. 
You can swing it. This way, 
 
Brad, Dacus, 
Babygirl. Take a trip with me: 
On, an exotic fantasy 
I know your man will be mad 
If. He knew I was the best you ever had 
On vacation conversation is cool 
Let's, take a swim in the pool, 
Begin the romance slow dance. 
You know the circumstances 
Whisper in your ear, 
Making advances giving glances 
Picture this on the canvas 
Sipping on pina coladas 
On, the beach in the Bahamas, 
Away from all the drama, 
 
2 You stay on my mind, 
Think about you all the time 
Got to get to Know you well 
If you kiss, then I won't tell 
 
Kiss me. Oh hold me, I say squeeze me. Oh squeeze me whoa 
Kiss me. Oh hold me, I say squeeze me whoa kiss me: 
 
Missy, 
 
One, two uh check it check it check it out. 
Follow follow me many many many miles, 
One two check it out. 
 Lem me lem me lem me lem me lem me break it down. 
 
One, two check it out. 
Follow follow me many many many miles. 
 
One, two break it down. 
 Lem me lem. Me lem me lem me, lem me break it down. 
 
This track is nasty like pornography 
Work, the mommy I like Joe, but he sloppy, dag 
Poppy got a brand new bag for real 
I taking'Quel O'neil like shaq shak, 
Ask, Michael Jackson, who bad 
He says. I am but the queen not drag dag 
I'm bad enough to let my pants sag 
I be in'Vegas where 702 be at 
Check it out. 
, 
Brad, Dacus, 
At sight. It'S visual 
Could, it be physical attraction. 
I hear you're diggin' my steelo so come. Show me some action. 
What'Cha gon' do 702 
I guarantee you'll, be loving me after I'm through 
Apparently. You know what I'll do 
Get it get it. Let me hit it, you don't stop. 
We won't stop till I'm finished 
Babygirl. It'S your world 
I'll, be your friend like those diamonds and pearls
