Cirrus Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


Everywhere they go.
It's like a blanket for the Earth.
But they're so far away.
From what they shelter.
Sometimes they fall.
And leave their mark upon the ground.
But it's alright, they will appear again.
Just like us.

The sun has set.
And so the sky is now on fire.
And as it burns.
I wonder what will guide us.
But now I know.
That there is light beyond the clouds.
And when they glow.
I see the stars shine through them.

Don't fade away.
It's not your place to go.
And when the light comes through.
I know we'll find our way.
