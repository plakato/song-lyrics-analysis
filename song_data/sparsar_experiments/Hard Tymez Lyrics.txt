Hard Tymez Lyrics
by Yukmouth.


Its hard tymez...its hard tymez...its hard tymez.
Its hard tymez...its hard tymez...these hard tymez.

Z-Ro.
My people get crushed on by poverty, got lives that scarred.
Single mother selling her body, nigga times are hard.
Wheres the Lord when I need a blessing.
Devil's be after me supply your child with a weapon.
My nigga ran up in a bank, sixty seconds for a lifetime bid.
And I don't get ???, now he selfish just for trying to feed his kid.
I'm living for mo', lead us out of slavery.
Revolution is coming but for now we waiting patiently.
Started out fiending to eat and starving together.
So when we crumble, survive of this place start robbing each other.
We got 'jects and those that eject, and those that die.
Refuse to come up out their shit so now they close they eyes.
Ask my nilla servin milla at that mexican joe.
Muthafuckers ran up with AK's straight letting em go.
We tried to walk straight and narrow but we end up going to jail.
For selling drugs, no wonder my people out here smelling blood.

Trae.
These hard times really be crazy and I don't want to lose it.
But the reality got the pistol b, and I feel like I abused it.
Till the banks peeping through cracks hoping I see the light.
So every night I praying to God, I'm beggin he make me right.
True 'nuff, we gotta be our own man dying ain't part of my plan.
I've been broke all through my life so struggling and new to me man.
I lost family after family, sittin lonely in my zone.
The only way I express myself is when I'm doing these songs.
I throw the drugs I prefer to face ??? with my pain.
I stay in my lane but appeal to people I'm doing the same.
My brother Deeky in the pen facing three with a L.
The only thing that he ever see was penitentiary cell.
Through all my niggas pass, even Big Mello too.
To Mafio to Screw Up Click, we gotta ride for you.
Cause these be hard times, deep down I be scarred times.
I want to cry but then I can't cause it be bar time.

Yukmouth.
We got evicted so its crunch time.
See me and my little sister earning free brick cheese in the lunch line.
Now I'm running from one time under the sunshine.
With one nine, stick to my hustle stay on my grind.
With the fine mind, body, and soul.
God placed my feet on solid ground, all ten toes.
Like the deeper than each holes in the benz-o, it's more like a trap.
To see how far you could get without getting blowed off the map.
Get stabbed in the back, getting blast with a gat.
In this ghetto and havoc thats when they move slabs of crack.
My parents both died, how to handle that.
We light candles and cry wish we had them back.
Sometimes I want to commit suicide blaze the steel.
My father died from having HIV, AIDS is real.
Lord forgive us cause we hustle just to pay the bills.
Struggled in the projects never stayed in the hills...hard times.
