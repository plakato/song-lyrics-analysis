California Dreamin' Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.

All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey.
I went for a walk on a winter day.
I'd feel so safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreaming on such a winters day.

I stopped into a church.
I passed along the way.
I got down on my knees.
And I pretended to pray.
You know the preachers he likes it cold.
So he knows I'm gonna stay.
California dreaming on such a winters day..

All the leaves are brown and the sky is so grey. I went for a walk on a cold.
winter's day. I'd feel so safe and warm if I was in L.A.. But.
I'm California dreaming on such a winter's day.

California dreaming.
California dreaming.

California, California Dreamin'.
California Dreamin'.

I know it's just a dream.

Dream on.

California Dreamin'.
