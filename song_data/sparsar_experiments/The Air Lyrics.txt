The Air Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

The air is unbearably harmful tonight.
Take me away from these old city lights.
And I would be better off.
With your lovely limbs just wrapped around me tonight.

This love is unbearably harmful tonight.
Should we call it quits.
And end it for the night.
Could we be better off with someone else just wrapped around us tonight.
