She Down For Me Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


She Down For Me, She Down For Me.

If it all goes down, she down for me.
If it all goes down, she down for me.
If it all goes down, she down for me.
She down for me, she down for me.
If it all goes down, she down for me.
If it all goes down, she down for me.
If it all goes down, she down for me.
She down for me, she down for me.
She down for me, she down for me.

Plenty niggas sliding in her Dm's.
I ain't gotta worry baby girl so loyal.
So its only right I treat her like she royal.
Spoil her with all designer clothes.
Giuseppes and Michael kors.
I do it for you girl, so drop it for me girl.
Lets kick it like Miguel, all I want is you girl.
Cause you do me well, she never kiss and tell.
Cause we was creeping on the DL.
That was two months ago.
Realest chick I ever met.
I knew she was the one before we were intimate.
Realest chick I ever met.
I knew she was the one before we were intimate.

Never met a girl this real.
Word to my momma she is the real deal.
Shawty like my style, man she like the way I dress.
I'm fresher than y'all niggas.
I'm a Teesside brudda.
Nah here we don't murder.
But every beat I'm on you know I'm finna murder.
And thats word to my mudda.
I'm tryna get paid like Sean Carter.
This rap shit is so easy.
Wack rappers make it look harder.
I had to do this for you girl.
You better come thru for your boy.
Fuck that power couple shit.
We just two motherfuckas in love.
And it feels so great.
