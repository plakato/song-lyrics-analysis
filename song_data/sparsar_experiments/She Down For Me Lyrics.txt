She Down For Me Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


She Down For Me She Down For Me, 
 
If. It all goes down she down for me, 
If. It all goes down she down for me, 
If. It all goes down she down for me, 
She down for me she down for me 
If. It all goes down. She down for me 
If, it all goes down she down for me 
If. It all goes down she down for me, 
She down for me she down for me, 
She down for me she down for me, 
 
Plenty, niggas sliding in her Dm's 
I ain't got. Ta worry baby girl, so loyal 
So its only right. I treat her like she royal 
Spoil, her with all designer clothes, 
Giuseppes and Michael kors 
I. Do it for you girl, so drop it for me, girl 
Lets, kick it like Miguel. All I want, is you girl 
Cause, you do me. Well, she never kiss and tell 
Cause. We was creeping on the DL 
That was two months ago. 
Realest chick I ever met. 
I knew she was the one before we were intimate, 
Realest chick I ever met. 
I knew she was the one before we were intimate. 
 
Never met a girl, this real 
Word to my momma. She is the real deal 
Shawty like my style man. She like the way I dress 
I'm fresher than y'all niggas 
I'm a Teesside brudda 
Nah. Here we don't murder 
But every beat I'm on you know, I'm finna murder, 
And thats word to my mudda 
I'm tryna get paid like Sean Carter. 
This rap shit is so easy. 
Wack rappers make it look harder. 
I had to do this, for you girl, 
You, better. Come thru for your boy, 
Fuck that power couple shit 
We just two motherfuckas in love, 
And. It feels so great
