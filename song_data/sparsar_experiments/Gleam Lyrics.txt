Gleam Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: The Quill.
Gleam.
Step inside my wonderwheel and we'll go for a ride.
Cause you need to see things from above Step inside to see the light.
Step inside to see the light I shed all over.
Come on slow, come on slow.
Feel it grow, feel it grow.
Now you're here to see what's hidden down in the haze.
If you're asking me it's just a shell with a face.
Let me show you there's a gleam of light.
Step into my wonderwheel and we'll go for a ride.
Cause I have to show you colors fade Step inside to see the light.
Step inside to see the light I shed all over.
Close your eyes, close your eyes.
Sacrifice, sacrifice.
