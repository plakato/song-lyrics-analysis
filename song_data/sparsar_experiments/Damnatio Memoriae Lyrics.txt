Damnatio Memoriae Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Well, it's just the fault of circumstance.
The game of youth, the threat of chance.
And I can't seem to find another way.
To justify my loss of words.
But some day, they say I'll be cured.
But be assured I'll always be this way.
And we all suffer guilt and shame.
In the frame of skin and bones.
Little one, you're not alone.
I think it's time you stepped out of the shade.
But who among your chosen ones?
Am I to be so bold to the one who can't be told?
No, don't believe a single thing I say.

But I recall that night right well.
You stood the streets while darkness fell.
Said you could tell I had something to say.
Well I tried to leave, but you said no.
That eventually we all must go.
So we search the town to find out why we stay.
But now the day's are growing thin.
And the leaves litter the streets.
And the fog infests my sheets.
And we're each too scared to even greet the day.

Can't escape my own deceit.
Oh I do intend to meet myself someday.

It sickens me to see you now.
With your pursed lips and your purchased crowd.
Spouting out self-evidence as proof.
But you are virtue, you are why.
Mothers weep and young men die.
For just the sight of the pyrite of your tombs.
But what shames me the most.
My dear, is the hate you left behind.
In the shadows of my mind.
And the cold outlines.
Where once you used to lay.
So I'll pour out this potting glass.
And attempt to wash my hands.
Of what your memory demands.
No, I never planned for things to end this way.
