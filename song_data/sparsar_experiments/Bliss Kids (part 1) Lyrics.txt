Bliss Kids (part 1) Lyrics
by The Wolf Pack.


Rhyme different dawg.
Coz being me makes me bliss.
Coz we just them different kids,.

'98 baby.
Man I'm going fucking crazy.
I rhyme and shine tight,.
Your swag talking it just bites.
But lemme talk swag anyway.
Look kids this isn't bragging class.
Where you show up with sagging pants.
Couple of gold, watch bigger than your hands.
Sure you can have it all.
But it ain't suppose to be part of your lyrical.
But who am I to judge,huh? Huh?
Uhmean its not like my rhymes are so deep.
It would take about an hour for you to land at the bottom if you were to leap.
See that's depth son.
Stick to the basics first you moving too fast doing futuristic shit, Jetsons.

Rock your Flinstones,.
Rock your twin shit.
Rock whatever you want but just calm down with the current shit bitch.

Uhh,Wolf Pack.

If I go back in time.
And I look how I use to bust a rhyme.
From time to time.
Looking at niggas that wanna commit crimes.
And never do the time.
And face the fines.
But did I really give a damn? No.

Yes sir you got it right.
Until I nearly got into a fight.
Do you really think its right.
To reference things you wanna bite.
Haha nigga that was a long time ago.
Concealing it for a long time, I never thought I'd whole a grudge for this.
long.
Oh well sob story let's forget about it.
We off topic.
Let's go back to the first line.
Where we talk about my self rhyming rhymes.
From time to time.
So back then I wasn't all that.
Tell me all the facts I wasn't really that good.
And so I respect yall niggas.
For showing all your figures.
And showing all the talent you got.
