Digits Lyrics
by Zoetic.


With different genre's, im makin' hella commas.
Thats the first double entendre, go spark the marijuana.
Oh you don't got some? lemme spark this llama.
So you could receive some problems like minajin' wit Maddonna.
I'm droppin' the common knowledge that this artist keeps it honest.
One hunit, bad bitches around me, like a college.
Ebonics, spoken by a white boy with harmonics.
You doubt me? i've been smokin' chronic since an embryonic.
These phonics, got me speakin' in tongues, like i'm demonic.
But i got the voice of a god, now isn't that ironic?
You could call it what you want it, bad bitch wit ass and she flaunt it.
I want it....
I want it....
So i, slide up her neck, wit both hands on her breasts.
I tell her that she's the best, and she rewards me wit sex.
And in the background you hear them speakers playin' that tic.
That's something else, some other shit.
Fuck a bitch until the rubber split.
Hit it too fast and i might just spit.
Tie her body down and i'm likin' it.
So fuck the game, cause i'm pipin' it.
And fuck the pen that you writin' wit.
I don't like ya stuff stop recitin' it.
You'll never be more than a whiny bitch!
Yo... i'm the opposite of Ghandi.
Wit this molly in my body.
You prolly, couldn't calm me wit a hundred spartan armies.
Imma zombie, eatin' brains is my muthafuckin' hobby.
I wanna stick my vampire fangs into ya jugular vein.
And watch the blood drain!
Like i'm starin' at the sink when the.
faucet's turned on.
So why the fuck would i turn down, can we move on?
Like it was Uhaul, i'm hittin' the cue ball.
Inside of a pool hall, she givin' me blue balls.
I told her she's too gall, my money is too tall.
You tryin' to shot call, stop dressin' like Rupaul.
You shoppin' in cheap malls, you shootin' i hit sprawl.
End it once and for all... you cannot beat me ya'll.
Like i said before, move on.
I'm mixin' potions inside the blackest caul-.
Dren because i sin before the day even begin.
Levitate above my bed.
Every night i'm gettin' head.
Battle me put up ya bread.
But you better check the spread.
Cause all i ever do is win.
And imma keep shittin' till the very end when i'm dead, muthafucka.

Mind on my money mental sky is the limit.
If you can't take the heat, get out of hell's kitchen.
It's gettin' hotter by the minute, mufucka's is makin' digits.
Dig it.
