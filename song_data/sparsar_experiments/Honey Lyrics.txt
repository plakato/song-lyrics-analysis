Honey Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


If you want more love, then you gotta let it in baby.
If you want my soul, then you gotta turn it on.
If the sun comes first, you'll be drying out and faded.
So tonight I need to find you in my bones.

You know I'm gonna live it.
Though it's only for a minute.
On a wild wild level.
In the wild wild world.
Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Gettin' high till the morning.
No we'll never hear the warning.
But the sun keeps climing.
And our hearts keep falling.
Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Only now we know that we were born the same.

I let you go.

I let it get inside you.

I won't let you down.

I won't let it define you.

Have you lost more love than you could ever give, baby?
Have you lost more soul, no you've had to turn it on.
If the fight comes first, you'll be wishing we were burning.
In the light, I find you resting in my bones.

I feel the ?
I feel the ?
If both our hearts start kicking.
Nobody knows.
That we were born the same.

We learned a lesson from our love oh no.
Throwing atars into the night can light a flame.
But in the end when only dust is all we are.
Only then they'll know that we were born the same.
