Venus Lyrics
by XamVolo.


I'll be there, across the room.
Whiling away time waiting for the holidays.
Winter's cool; the sun's only here to tell me the time of day.
I just read the news, another little girl's just turned into a star.
Thats one more in the sky.
Just give her a billion years-.

She's gonna set the world alight.
It's a beautiful view, she's beautiful news.
She's gonna drift away from sight.
Like I've seen time and time again.

There she comes.
There she goes.
There goes Venus.
Out the door.
And she's beautiful.. beautiful...

I'll be there, across the street.
Watch Venus get chatted up by Mars.
Head like Jupiter, You're losing her.
You fools are a world apart.
She's a Blue Giant, she's a goddamn superstar.
Black holes full of shoes and cars.
Suits and ties and open fires-.

To set the world alight.
It's a beautiful view, she's beautiful news.
Penthouse patios and lingerie.
That I've seen time and time again.

Make her cum.
Make her go.
There goes Venus.
Out the door.
And she's beautiful.. beautiful...

Make it worth my while.
'Cos Astronomers like me.
Are used to seeing stars in their eyes...
Make it worth my while.
'Cos Astronomers like me.
Are used to seeing stars in their eyes...
Make it worth my while...
