Cocaine Dreams Lyrics
by Yungjay.

Call me old school fasion, but the fucks will be last to send.
I don't give one, so they remain abscent.
I used to give some but that was the past tense.
I thrive off your ability to give one so loosely.
The chosen one will choose one and make the king look stupid.
You want to fuck around? Well this round Earth I've been cruising.
Fucking women mentally after they've been physically abused and raped.
It's a light subject, unlike a bank safe....
But bank on this I would rather leave you than wait to be late....
If your mind is ignorant then I will penetrate.
I wear 3 inch collars, fangs and a cape.
Stuck in triangles my angels stay in shape.
Tried to sell out but I'd rather watch the weight.
The fittest stay fit, Just for survival.
Wanted to pay attention, but more reactions from a freestye.
.....
Respect God, Jesus, and the holy spirit.
The deals I've dealt with will not give me clearance.
Tried to ask for forgiveness, but still got no reassurance.
I kept on learnin, even when the World stopped turnin.
Knowledge is power but with power comes responsibility.
With responsibility comes new found abilities.
And reality of it is that I'm only fuckin 17.
I could be on the inside of your glove and you still won't be feelin me.
Able capabilities, stable st-abilities.
Spittin no bullshit, only comin with nobility.
I had 6 different hearts, in all different places.
And I've seen a million people, with all different faces.
Everyone running towards the finish, all different races.
I hate the human race, but I'm not a racist.
Were a disease, an infection just bacteria.
The big bang? Naw I think God just had diarrhea.
Shit us out!
