Baby Come On Lyrics
by +44.

She's a pretty girl.
She's always falling down.
And I think I just fell in love with her.
But she won't ever remember, remember.

And I can always find her.
At the bottom of a plastic cup.
Drowning in drunk sincerity.
A sad and lonely girl.

Quit crying your eyes out.
Quit crying your eyes out, and baby come on.
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on.
Quit crying your eyes out, baby.

And she said, I think we're running out of alcohol.
Tonight I hate this fucking town.
And all my best friends will be the death of me.
But they won't ever remember, remember.

So please take me far away.
Before I melt into the ground.
And all my words get used against me.
You sad and lonely girl.

Quit crying your eyes out.
Quit crying your eyes out, and baby come on.
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on.
Quit crying your eyes out.
Isn't there something familiar about me?
Quit crying your eyes out.
The past is only the future with the lights on.
So quit crying your eyes out, baby.
