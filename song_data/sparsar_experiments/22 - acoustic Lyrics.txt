22 - acoustic Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters.
And make fun of our exes, ah ah, ah ah.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight.
To fall in love with strangers, ah ah, ah ah Yeah we're happy, free, confused.
and lonely at the same time.
It's miserable and magical oh yeah.
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time I don't know.
about you but I'm feeling 22.
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you.
You don't know about me but I bet you want too.
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22 It seems.
like one of those nights, this place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids,  ah ah, ah ah.
It seems like one of those nights we ditch the whole scene.
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping Yeah we're happy, free, confused and.
lonely in the best way.
It's miserable and magical oh yeah.
Tonight's the night we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time Uh oh, I don't.
know about you but I'm feeling 22.
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you.
You don't know about me but I bet you want too.
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22. 22 It feels.
like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news.
I gotta have you, I gotta have you.
