Tip Jar Lyrics
by World's Fair.


One got a nice rack.
One got a bubble butt.
Only one Metro card.
Show you how they double up.
Shake her double Ds, but her friend kinda flat.
She can make that ass clap.
Two broke girls in the city.
With a ? pass.
Speaking out the tray.
Show me where the fun at.
Playin' hard to get.
Cause they been did done that.
At the open bar.
Show me where the fun's at.
Who got a dollar.
Who, who got a dollar.
Who got a dollar.
Who, who got a dollar for the tip jar.

Nasty Nigel.
Dominican physique, like Raffaelo Ts.
Mama turnin' 23 by the end of the week.
Lansky.
But she's really 17.
You'd better keep it discrete.
Band around her head matches the Toms on her feet.
How she tryin' to ride clean with a Metro card, great.
Hair gelled down and her ringtone, The-Dream.
Fuck with bitches in class.
I fuck with bitches with class.
Dollars, BBQ, she ask.
You got cash.
Now that ?
She tried to pay the cab with a gift card.
It bounced back, I got that.
That sounds a bit odd.
God damn, my date is runnin' late.
She text me 'round six.
It's now 8:28.
I swear, at 8:30, I'll dip.
Fuck how this girl feel.
I ain't tryin' to be the motherfucking third wheel.
Chill.
Man, these chicks runnin' games true.
And I ain't got a dollar for they motherfucking train home.

Hit Jerome's, and I ran into some broke hoes.
ASking me for weed.
Shorty, that's a no-no.
Drunk hoes, bitches hailin' from the suburbs.
Tryin' to hang around a nigga.
Prayin' for some free herb.
They need to be around the green.
Lookin' like a crouton.
It's funny how you the first victim.
That they can mooch on.
At the bar, drinkin' a Stella.
They get their groove on.
Cool, calm, collected.
But the pussy is lukewarm.
Professionals, they been doin' this for too long.
Shorty tryin' to flex like I don't know the tricks.
Drinkin' from my cup.
Tryin' to take big sips.
Walkin' 'round the bar.
Lookin' for a bogie.
Tryin' to catch a ride home.
Actin' like she know me.
Hey ma, what's up.
I'm broke, me too.
Oh well, I'm dippin' on a cab tonight.
Haha, broke ass.
