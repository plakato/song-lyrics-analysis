Beautiful Child Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

When I am older, than
These small goddamned hills
And, there's no reason
For my mind to be still

Oh, how I'll feel like a beautiful child
Such, a beautiful child again
Such, a beautiful child
Such, a beautiful child again

When. I have finally found
My room filled with toys
Be banging on my crib
Excited by noise

How I'll feel
Oh, how I'll feel
Oh, how I'll feel like a beautiful, child
Such, a beautiful child again
Such, a beautiful child
Such, a beautiful child again

And when there's nothing to gain
Or, bring me pain
Or, pin the blame
On you Or myself

And, when they finally fall
These wailing, walls
And burdened crosses
God's, twilights and all

How I'll feel
Oh, how I'll feel
Oh, how I'll feel like

Such a beautiful child
Such, a beautiful child again

When? I am older, than
These small goddamned, hills
