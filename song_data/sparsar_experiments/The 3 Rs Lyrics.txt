The 3 Rs Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Eh Jax/ Where you gone to, Ajax? /.
To escape from Toronto, the awful caldron of your problems? /.
To quote Joe Budden Bars/ we may have come apart/.
But the rule is still John Q, son can have my heart/.
Listen bro, I know exactly what suicidal means now/.
Cause I've been through the drama, and seen down that street now/.
Boulevards of Broken dreams, Avenues of.
‘Ain't Mad at You'/.
Which of us deserves the blame, don't know exactly who/.
Man, is that even important? / How to extort it? /.
But I'm ain't saying our friendship can ever be restored kid/.
But no lie, I was riding the Subway, and saw a status/.
Thought you committed suicide, and I was mad as/.
Fuck! Cause I blamed myself, had a manic panic attack/.
Now on pills for anxiety, don't know how to relax/.
But if Nature calls violently, when you gotta take a piss/.
Maybe God calls, when your friend decides to give a shit/.
Are you alive?

Repercussion, Regret, Repentance.

Yo here's how bullies are made/ when they were kids they/.
Were picked on/ then became big dogs/ then were sicked on/.
Other little kids, yeah yeah we know this shit's wrong/.
It's why I wrote the words to the beat of this song/.
Yo picture me as a little fat white child/ with a basketball swag style/.
Bullied by the 8th graders, no more smile/.
So I found this little skinny white kid, named Max/.
That I could bully back/ to assert my dominance like a fact/.
We were in middle school, obsessed with and messed with the girls/.
But Max was obsessed with squirrels, no lying, yup! with the squirrels/.
No no no, not sexually man/.
But I guess we always fear that which we don't understand/.
But Max, did make all these really cool clay figurines/.
Of superheroes like Superman, the Hulk and Wolverine/.
I really wanted one of these things/ so I just asked him.
‘Could I please have one?' / and he said, ‘Yeah yeah no prob man, done' /.
But the months went by, and it wasn't out of the oven/.
I started to intimidate with mean stares and punching/.
When we were small, gotta show ourselves bigger than we was/.
Its what drives all the Governments and Gangs to draw deep blood/.
Ripples in the pound, are an ominous omen/.
Of the tsunamis coming cause of things we did or were spoken/.
It haunts me and I wish I could take some things back/.
The last time I heard of Max/ he was smoking crack/.
