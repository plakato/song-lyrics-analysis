Eye of the Storm Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.

When the world's caving in.
And the world stops.
Hear the voices.
Beckoning.
Me towards the rocks.

Lie awake.
Watch the city sleep.
Silent road.
Watch the crowds.
Leave their seats.
And the credits roll.

I believe in you.
I believe in you.
It's not over.

I will stand.
In the eye.
Of the storm.

musical break.

Feel the pulse.
Quickening.
Brushing eyes.
Feel my hide.
Sickening.
In pain subside.

I believe in you.
I believe in you.
It's not over.
I will stand.
In the eye.
Of the storm.
I will stand.
In the eye-.
I will stand.
In the eye.
Of the storm!

It's not over!
It's not over!
It's not over!
Of the storm!

musical break.
