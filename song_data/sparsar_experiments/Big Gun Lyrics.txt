Big Gun Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.


Oh, Saturday night special, little suit me right.
And it ain't the kinda blade you can use in a fight.
Made 'em along, well, it's all that I need.
You can shove it your standards, cause I have my own creed.

Ain't got no big gun, I ain't got no big gun.

You call me mean mistreater, cause the name don't suit me right.
When it come to time to bleed her, I'll make my cut go line.
Know what I got and I know just how to use it.
You can keep a child away, boys, cause I don't wanna lose it.

Ain't got no big gun, ain't got no big gun.
I said I ain't got no big gun, ain't got no big gun.

Call me blacker jacker, cause the bingo lickin' good.
And when you're linin' all your backup, I keep you everything a wood.
Cause I been so lonely, baby, withouta ain't no quested honey.
And if you were my good girl, give me your lovin', all your money.

Ain't got no big gun, I ain't got no big gun.
I said I ain't got no big gun, I ain't got no big, big, big gun.
