Fantasies Lyrics
by The Runaways.


Night visions of fantasies.
Are laying in bed with me.
In the dark I can see you smiling.
You touch my body and set my soul on fire.
Oh yeh.

I can see morning light.
The sun is rising, shining in your eyes.
Suddenly you're gone.
And I'm left here all alone.
Oh yeh.

Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming.
Oh yeh.

Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming.
Oh yeh.

I know you're here.
I can feel your presence.
And that sound you're making.
It's getting me so hot.
Oh yeh.

Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming.
Oh yeh.
