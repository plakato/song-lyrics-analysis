Fruityrelationships Lyrics
by Blood Duster.

I was the first to place fruit in your bits.
A rock solid love with vegetables and shit.
It started one night when we where alone.
Naked and bored the fridge light was on.

With bananas n' others inserted in the night.
The fruit of our labors the time it was ripe.
