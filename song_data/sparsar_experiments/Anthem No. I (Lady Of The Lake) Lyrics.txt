Anthem No. I (Lady Of The Lake) Lyrics
by Sweet.

Connolly/Scott/Tucker/Priest.

Your are the queen.
I'm just a pawn.
In the Chess game of Life.
Send me to war.
A Whisper to the king.
Of the favours you gave me.
I will take my chance.
On a crusade of love.

Be my lady of the lake.
Come love me before it's too late.
Be my lady of the lake.
For the angel with the sword of death won't wait.
The colours that I wear.
Show me just how much you care.
Lady.

My body is done.
My soul will return.
To the Lady of the Lake.
Dying came too soon.
Cry no more tears.
There's love after life.
A king and his queen everlasting light.

Be my lady of the lake.
Come love me before it's too late.
The colours that I wear.
Show me just how much you care Lady.
