Don't Lose Hope Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

I can see you.
Sitting there feeling like the world has passed you by.
I can feel you.
I feel you there thinking that your time is running out.
It's been so long since somebody.
Patted you on the back.
But what do you need that for.
Reach inside your heart and explore.
There's nothing you can't do if you pray.
Stay in the fight a litle longer for better days.
Never lose hope for tommorrow.
Never lose sight of the ribbon in the sky.
Never forgo into sorrow.
The rain will come but the sun must shine.
Keep hope alive.
I can see you.
With a smile on your face because you came out on top.
I can feel you.
You used what you had and you now know it was a lot.
Now you feel so strong from behind the past.
You bounced your way back.
It's what you are living for.
Reach inside you heart and explore.
There's nothing you can't do if you pray.
Stay in the fight a little longer for better days.
Never lose hope for tommorrow.
Never lose sight of the ribbon in the sky.
Never forgo into sorrow.
The rain will come but the sun must shine.
Keep hope alive.
Follow your dreams by any means.
It doesn't matter what it seems.
Hold on to your pride.
It is the fuel of your energy to your destiny.
Never lose hope of what tommorrow brings.
Never lose hope for tommorrow.
Never lose sight of the ribbon in the sky.
Never forgo into sorrow.
The rain will come but the sun must shine.
Keep hope alive.
I can see you.
No matter what the world may say keep hope alive.
I can feel you.
No matter what surrounds you keep hope alive.
