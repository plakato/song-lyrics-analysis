Aim 4 the Head Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
*Watch 'em now, watch 'em now*.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Let them lames know you ain't playin with 'em.

Cassidy.
Shit real, I know how baggin a whole brick feel.
Big deal, hit the garage and switch wheels.
My chicks real, with the menage and tip drills.
Give me a massage, then show me how them lips feel.
I'm shinin cause I'm clinin on the strip still.
And I grip steel, still keep the clip steel.
Everything I spit real, everything I spit ill.
Everything spit sick, for real.
When shit switch, ain't shit changed.
Like Rick James, I'm rich bitch.
Get change, big chain and wrist gliss.
I'm with game, I'mma make cake like this quick.
My album went gold in a month, that was a quick flip.
Don't say shit bitch, cause niggas with the lip bit.
Ain't one in the gun, 'till it go click click.
Then I'm gon'switch clips and squeeze like toothpaste.
Palm over my forearm so I could shoot straight.

Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Let them lames know you ain't playin with 'em.

Jin.
My objective is to live lavish, rip mad kids.
Jin stand out like Swiss ad libs.
Compared to me, your shit's average, no matter how you come.
Should've been spit on volume one, tell your corner it's time.
Throw in the towel, you done.
Call up Jimmy, Kevin Lyles, whoever you want.
It's a wrap, your career can not be saved.
Fuck makin a comeback, you ain't Flavor Flav.
Before my album dropped, I rocked show for G's.
Blowin trees, while I'm.

Flew to PR, won a quick fifty G's.
And I'm still poppin up on Smack DVD's.
Ain't got no platinum plaques for records sold.
But if eatin rappers was sales, I'm seven times gold.
Bout to blow, get set for detonation.
Speakin on behalf of the next generation.

Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Let them lames know you ain't playin with 'em.

J-Hood.
No matter what they spit, I still ain't convinced.
Not at all, your brains over the window, make it look like you got red tints.
Hope your GT got a bulletproof F-R-O-N-T.
Pop with them slugs and give a fuck about your Bentley.
You a punk and I'm a boss boy.
It's the U Cheeks and I ain't talkin bout that nigga from the Lost Boys.
The barrel was too big, you had to see the fall.
You had to see that havin it all was just a casualty of war.
I got keys like a cord when I'm swingin a sword.
I could bring you the law, got them things on the fog.
We the best and I ain't got to spit a punchline.
Cause I do situps all over the track when it's crunchtime.
Fuck this rap shit, I've been realer, you got thin scrilla.
I'll put this machette through the side of your chin chilla.
Black hoodie with the matchin fitted.
Don't come up short lil' man, we even clappin midgets.

Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Aim for the head, when you see him, go get him nigga.
Let them lames know you ain't playin with 'em.
