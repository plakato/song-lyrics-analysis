Girl I Need You Lyrics
by ViZion.


Girl I need you so.
Tell me why my heart feels so low.
Girl I want you more.
Please don't leave me standing at the door.

On these nights when we fight I go to bed lonely.
I'm worrying while wondering if you'll phone me.
Wish I wasn't alone, this breeze is blowing coldly.
Tell me, why this lonliness surrounds me.
Love on the phone line, killing us slowly.
Can't kiss the phone and the phone cannot hold me.
So much foundation, to act like you don't know me.
Girl that's only phony, put your arms around me.

Girl I need you so.
Tell me why my heart feels so low.
Girl I want you more.
Please don't leave me standing at the door.
Girl I need you so.
Tell me why my heart feels so low.
Girl I want you more.
Please don't leave me standing at the door.

Feeling down and lonely after all of the drama.
Will never forget her, she was my nirvana.
Teardrops are clear, so I hid behind this armour.
Trying to feel better, smoke more marijuana.
Sitting, on a corner.
Drinking, Johnny Walker.
Bottle and body dressed in black like a mourner.
She came back, no-one warned her.
I think that, must've torn her.
I only cried her name when she disappeared around the corner.

Girl I need you so.
Tell me why my heart feels so low.
Girl I want you more.
Please don't leave me standing at the door.
Girl I need you so.
Tell me why my heart feels so low.
Girl I want you more.
Please don't leave me standing at the door.

Now you say yes it's best that I go.
But I don't care what you say I'm standing at the door.
I walked from your door once before.
Tired and unsure, of what we were fighting for.
But girl I learned my love is as secure.
As the sun rise on the hills and the rain will pour.
Solid as a rock with an iron core.
I don't wanna feel that heartburn no more.

Girl I need you so.
Tell me why my heart feels so low.
Girl I want you more.
Please don't leave me standing at the door.
Girl I need you so.
Tell me why my heart feels so low.
Girl I want you more.
Please don't leave me standing at the door.
