Live From The Bottom Lyrics
by Xc.


Reporting live from the bottom let me tell you bout Erica.
She'd be a doctor or something if she just cared enough.
She just broke up with Joseph cause he wanted to marry her.
And he ain't got his own shit she say he embarrass her.
But they got a lil girl he just wanna take care of her.
She called the state up and said he never be there enough.
Damn so they went and put him on child support.
And he ain't coming around no more.
But she don't give a fuck she boutta find her a star.
She fucking them dope boys she hopping up outta cars.
She go to the club soon as 12'oclock hit.
And she going home with.
Whoever buy out the bar.
Damn you'd think her moms tell her slow down baby just chill.
But mama said it ain't love if he ain't paying ya bills.
Thats ill I mean thats the woman that raised her.
The way she came up.
Could yo really blame her.

Reporting live from the bottom.
Reporting live from the bottom.
Reporting live from the bottom Ain't no signs from the fathers.
Either they walked out or them guys came and got em.
If you listen close you can hear the crys from their daughters.
And the sons they just happy that their moms didn't follow.

Repoting live from the bottom my nigga Kevin he all in.
It really ain't nothing you can tell him he balling.
I mean his whip mean.
And he keep his kicks clean.
Shit he been paying bills since he was 16.
Now he 20 his moms tell him he bugging.
And he don't understand it man.
Use to live hand to mouth now they living hand to hand.
Police ran up in that spot swear they didn't stand a chance.
He pulled that 357 made em do the hammer dance.
And now he too legit to quit he pulled up his pants and ran.
An officer died in that ambulance.
In deep shit.
He ain't hit the precinct.
But he ain't had a good night sleep since.
He tensed his uncle tell him its nothing lil nigga you bitching.
And you know what happen to you they hear that you snitching.
Just listen thats his uncle yo, And thats the one that raised him.
So how he came up could you really blame him.

Reporting live from the bottom.
You ever looked in the eyes of a guy from the bottom.
He just wanna cry, he look the sky.
And he start questioning God I'm thinking how could I stop him.
When everything he worked for never seem to work shit.
School for 6 years and never learned shit.
Use to think its priceless and now he think its worthless.
Because he did it to death but he ain't never earn shit.
I tryna tell him it'll pay off.
He like X don't bring that shit this way dog.
Working this job for 3 years took no days off.
And right out of the fucking blue I got layed off.
Damn here he go he feeling like here we go.
The only woman he loved died over a year ago.
See thats his grandmother she the one that raise him.
So if he gave up could you really blame him.
It don't matter cause he'd blame his self.
Offer him anything he wouldn't take your help.
Some niggas looking for crutches he tryna brace hisself.
Tryna imagine the way he felt.
He was working hard just to keep his lights on.
While Kevin and Erica party all night long.
Listen I'm tryna get you to focus in.
They all at the bottom he the only one that notices.
