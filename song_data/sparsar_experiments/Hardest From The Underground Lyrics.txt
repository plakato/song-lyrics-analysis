Hardest From The Underground Lyrics
by Ruste Juxx.


Good riddance, niggas ain't spitting.
Horse fly style, ain't bull shitting.
Me, on the other hand, brother man.
Destroy mics, that's word to the motherland.
Africa, I'm drastic bruh.
Kill 'em, bury 'em, flip your casket sir.
Fuck 5-0, enemies die slow.
Stupid niggas done forgot, but the wise know.
It's RJ repping that BK.
From KA, swinging that AK.
Shoutout to Brownsville, my Flatbush niggas.
White widow, real Bubba Kush niggas.
Fire flame lighting it up.
Kicking hot shit, yeah, five mic-ing it up.
Nigga, you ever got the shit pushed in?
Just listen to the styles that my pen pushed in.

Can't stop, won't stop, banging that sound.
Ruste Juxx, hardest from the underground.
I do what I does, I does what I do.
Get mine, so I don't give a fuck about you.
If it ain't about money, it's irrelevant.
I stay paid in the shade getting hella bent.
Big face bills, fat pussy hoes.
Cardboard condos, homemade bungalow.
Me and Kyo is a two man wrecking team.
No bum shit, bitch we getting cream.
Cause homie this ain't the norm.
A hundred fans faint every time that I perform.
Fire flame lighting it up.
Kicking hot shit, yeah, five mic-ing it up.
Nigga, you ever got the shit pushed in?
Just listen to the styles that my pen pushed in.
