Hardest From The Underground Lyrics
by Ruste Juxx.


Good riddance niggas ain't, spitting, 
Horse, fly style, ain't, bull, shitting, 
Me. On the other hand, brother man, 
Destroy mics, that's word to the motherland 
Africa, I'm drastic bruh 
Kill'em bury'em flip your casket, sir 
Fuck 5-0 enemies die slow, 
Stupid, niggas done forgot, but the wise know: 
It's RJ repping that BK 
From KA swinging that AK 
Shoutout to Brownsville. My Flatbush niggas 
White widow, real Bubba, Kush, niggas, 
Fire flame lighting, it up 
Kicking hot shit, yeah five mic-ing it up 
Nigga you ever got the shit pushed in 
Just, listen to the styles that my pen pushed in 
 
Can't. Stop won't stop banging that sound 
Ruste Juxx hardest from the underground 
I. Do what I does. I does what I do 
Get mine, so I don't give a fuck about you. 
If it ain't about money. It'S irrelevant, 
I stay paid in the shade. Getting hella bent 
Big face bills, fat, pussy, hoes, 
Cardboard, condos, homemade, bungalow, 
Me and Kyo is a two man wrecking team, 
No bum shit bitch, we getting cream 
Cause homie this ain't, the norm, 
A hundred fans faint every time that I perform 
Fire flame lighting. It up 
Kicking hot shit, yeah five mic-ing it up 
Nigga you ever got the shit pushed in 
Just, listen to the styles that my pen pushed in
