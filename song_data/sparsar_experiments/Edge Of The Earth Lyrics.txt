Edge Of The Earth Lyrics
by Volumes.

To go as far, as far as I can see, at the edge of the earth.
The continuous sound of lights that have reached the bottom.
In the middle of the desert I stared patiently to see them touch the ground.
Imploding on the cracked mud surface.
I knelt down underneath the midway, in the millionth sighting.

Lets lay back, sitting inside my car, at the edge of the earth.
I turned my head to the left and I knew I could not be drugged.
Orbs with infusion white mirroring the image of a silhouette.
At the edge of the earth.

And I'm here tonight, underneath the influence.
And why can't I find a way out?
It's calling me tonight, this secret I have become.
At the edge of the earth.

You misunderstood the gravity as the weight falls apart.
You'll watch me walk away.
I walk away, calm as the wind.
You'll watch me go.
