A Song For Patsy Cline Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

My airbag light's been on for weeks.
And I keep having dreams.
Where I go through the windshield but I don't fix it.
Patsy Cline came and sang to me.
She told everybody.
How she knew she would die soon before she did.

I hear her cry on Faded Love.
The air in August here's heavy with salt and smoke and stings my lungs.

My airbag light's been on for weeks.
And I can feel it mock me.
It's bittersweet like laughter through crooked teeth.
I want to move so far from everything.
That they could hear my heart beat.
And then break as I lay dying in the street.

They'll think the ice cracked at the lake.
They'll think a tire blew out and a car crashed on the interstate.

It's hard to watch you walk away.
These aren't the vultures that were circling just yesterday.
It's hard to watch you walk away.

Picking at bones, at what's left of your misery.

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh.
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh.

So when my vocal chords rip.
So when my knees give in.
So when I bury all of this.
Who's gonna give a shit.
If I'm breathing?

It's hard to watch you walk away.
These aren't vultures that were circling just yesterday.
It's hard to watch you walk away.

They're picking at bones, at what's left of your misery.

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh.
My airbag light's been on for weeks.

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh.
My airbag light's been on for weeks.
