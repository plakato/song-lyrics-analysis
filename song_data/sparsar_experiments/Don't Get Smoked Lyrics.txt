Don't Get Smoked Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


Let'S get it 
Know how I'm rockin man 
RIP LA man, fuck the opps 
Let's, get it 
 
I'm in traffic, with these poles 
Yellin' free, my bro D. Rose 
Put, this 40 to yo' nose 
Mark his face just like a mole, 
These niggas. Don'T want no smoke. 
Naw they don't want no smoke 
Bitch. We out here when it's cold 
'bout, my green, just like a toad 
Poppin' pills, I'm on a roll 
600. We liftin' souls 
Nailin' niggas. With these poles 
GDK, don't get exposed 
Niggas, they don't want no smoke 
Naw. They don't want. No smoke 
We in traffic with these poles 
So, don't get yo' ass smoked, 
 
For LA my niggas blow 
Catch that nigga smoke 
051 you niggas hoes 
Ask fathead about that smoke. 
060. My niggas tote 
600, my shooters blow 
In a steamer with yo' ho 
Fuck bricksquad. Don'T go jojo 
Bitch. We winnin' check the score 
It's like 6 to 24 
All. My niggas is 2-4 
Just to let you niggas know 
In the Wic bitch. That'S the O 
We, the real double O 
Lil jay, steady gettin', his ass smoked 
18 times to be exact. 
Quit that rappin' that shit whack 
You niggas some fuckin' flats 
Off these pills, I'm poppin flats, 
Jaro bitches, give good neck 
I'm in traffic.
