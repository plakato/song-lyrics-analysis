Don't Get Smoked Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


Let's get it.
Know how I'm rockin man.
RIP LA man fuck the opps.
Let's get it.

I'm in traffic with these poles.
Yellin' free my bro D. Rose.
Put this 40 to yo' nose.
Mark his face just like a mole.
These niggas don't want no smoke.
Naw they don't want no smoke.
Bitch we out here when it's cold.
'bout my green just like a toad.
Poppin' pills I'm on a roll.
600 we liftin' souls.
Nailin' niggas with these poles.
GDK don't get exposed.
Niggas they don't want no smoke.
Naw they don't want no smoke.
We in traffic with these poles.
So don't get yo' ass smoked.

For LA my niggas blow.
Catch  that nigga smoke.
051 you niggas hoes.
Ask fathead about that smoke.
060 my niggas tote.
600 my shooters blow.
In a steamer with yo' ho.
Fuck bricksquad don't go jojo.
Bitch we winnin' check the score.
It's like 6 to 24.
All my niggas is 2-4.
Just to let you niggas know.
In the Wic bitch that's the O.
We the real double O.
Lil jay steady gettin' his ass smoked.
18 times to be exact.
Quit that rappin' that shit whack.
You niggas some fuckin' flats.
Off these pills I'm poppin flats.
Jaro bitches give good neck.
I'm in traffic; where y'all at?
Stay put up or come get wet.
Bullets flyin at night like bats.
Bitch I'm on a lotta that.

I'm in traffic with these poles.
Yellin' free my bro D. Rose.
Put this 40 to yo' nose.
Mark his face just like a mole.
These niggas don't want no smoke.
Naw they don't want no smoke.
Bitch we out here when it's cold.
'bout my green just like a toad.
Poppin' pills I'm on a roll.
600 we liftin' souls.
Nailin' niggas with these poles.
GDK don't get exposed.
Niggas they don't want no smoke.
Naw they don't want no smoke.
We in traffic with these poles.
So don't get yo' ass smoked.

Smokin' dope that's to the face.
Shot p5 right In his face.
Sprayin' niggas like some mace.
No fuckin' face, no fuckin' case.
Free the guys, fuck the jakes.
Don't come outside, it ain't safe.
Sippin' lean I love the taste.
Ask yo' bitch how my dick taste.
Free my nigga Makado.
Cause my nigga mac'll do ya.
Tay600 got macs and rugers.
Rondo savage he'll shoot ya.
Cdai got 22 shots.
Bitch we out here on these blocks.
Booka walkin' 'round with mops.
Shoot a nigga out his socks.
Like a soda bitch we pop.
We'll smoke yo' fuckin' top.
We don't fuck around with thots.
That fuck around with opps.
Bitches too you can get shot.
Bullets burn that shit hot.
CPDK fuck the cops.
Free my niggas out that box.

I'm in traffic with these poles.
Yellin' free my bro D. Rose.
Put this 40 to yo' nose.
Mark his face just like a mole.
These niggas don't want no smoke.
Naw they don't want no smoke.
Bitch we out here when it's cold.
'bout my green just like a toad.
Poppin' pills I'm on a roll.
600 we liftin' souls.
Nailin' niggas with these poles.
GDK don't get exposed.
Niggas they don't want no smoke.
Naw they don't want no smoke.
We in traffic with these poles.
So don't get yo' ass smoked.
