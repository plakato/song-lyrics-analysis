Letterman Lyrics
by Punsy.


My name is DRE AKA, PUNSY
Repping DTF and I'm working OT
I'll use my ABCs and my 123s
To make LUV to the MPC
You'll, say OMG when I kill this beat
Here's a PSA, I'm a real MC
It's in my DNA homie. This is me
I'll always be about music like an MP3
I. Am changing hip hop? You can ENVY me
Cuz you're throwing concerts with EMPTY
seats
In the NBA I'd be MVP

I LOL at your useless feats
Dude. I suplex beats like it's UFC
I'm about to blow the spot like TNT
Or, a missile that you shoot from an RPG

And just as nasty as an album from TLC
Wishing RIP to my ENEMIES
You're, all DOA from my POV
Dead as VHS sony UMDs
Dead as TRL on MTV
Dead as BIG in His SUV
Dead as wu tang clan and ODB
I think WHY, OH, WHY, when I hear your
CD
I rather spend a whole week in the DMV
I SMH cuz you're like BET
You're, a big disgrace to NCAAP
Think you're, better than me, you're on LSD
Crack, PCP, X and THC
OH. I SEE you're OG like EASY, E
NWA and DPG
Cuz. You play COD on your PS3
Getting 10 kill streaks with your M16
See, I'm KRS1 EMINEM and Cool G
You're D4L and ICP
You're a BMX, I'm an ATV
With, crazy MPG, your tank's on E
I'm, the CEO status VIP
Everywhere, YOU BE. They ask to SEE ID

I'm an HD screen on a sprint 4G
You're, a TXT on an I60
I'm, an MBA from an HBCU
You're, a GED. Man. I'D hate to be you
TBH, I'm feeling GR8
I am AY; OK, shine like UV rays
I'm schooling. These cats, like the PTA
We're all in the same class. J, slash K
