Poser Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Catch me creeping up outside bitch.
I'm smoking in the night bitch.
These bitches want a taste of what I got, i'm cooking pies bitch.
Catch me with the knife bitch.
I'm tweaking got no spine bitch.
Addicted to bitches and getting rich is my mission.
I smoke the dope and i'm piffing.
My eyes roll back when i'm sipping.
It's just real loud like it's clipping.
We in the studio pimping.

We pull your card.
You acting like you hard but you not.
Selling dope up on these streets.
I got no life I got no heart.

Saying that you fucking flipping aye?
You saying that you fucking pimping what?
You saying that you fucking sipping thangs?
You saying that you'll fucking pull my card?
