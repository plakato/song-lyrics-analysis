Zones Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


It's not what you think.
Only what it looks like.
Too terse when I drink.
You like those longwinded types.
Puffing out their chests.
Talking circles round our eyes.

Mapping out their bodies in erogenous zones.
Bloody hands in pockets c'mon everyone knows.
Don't be too hard on your parents they.
Don't be too hard on your parents they really tried.

Don't curse while you eat.
It is unbecoming.
I said trick or treat.
And you left me with something else.

Mapping out their bodies in erogenous zones.
Bloody hands in pockets c'mon everyone knows.
Don't be too hard on your parents they.
Don't be too hard on your parents they really tried.
