James Brown Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


That's my boy Surreal on the beat right there baby.
They don't call me Breezo George Gervin for nothing.
I got them diamonds dancing on me nigga.
Diamonds dancing on me, James Brown.
Haha, 6-0 shit man.

Diamonds dancing on me, James Brown.
Retarded gun call it Atown.
Load the choppa then we spray rounds.
Niggas know we don't play round'.
Diamonds dancing on me, James Brown.

Water homie, bitch im like the ocean.
We just put your main bitch in motion.
Smokin loud, hoe I got the potion.
Pistols on us, we'll cause commotion.
George Gervin, I'm the ice man.
Burner on me give a nice tan.
Racks on me, bitch i'm just saying.
Im the player from the Himalayans.
Charged up like a Super Saiyan.
For that pussy, hoe I'm not paying.
You ain't worth it bitch, im just saying.
Up this gun, nigga start praying.
Smack a hoe with a open hand.
Diamonds looking like a broad day.
And I got it all from selling Yay.
Bags fat like Anime.
Diamonds ice skating on my neck.
Baby girl im playing with a check.
6-0 shit baby thats the set.
Pistol to ya if you disrespect.
Shaq city, baby baldy world.
George Gervin's what you call me girl.
In these bitches head like a curl.
Bitch you drunk like my Uncle Earl.

Ice on me, bitch im slip and sliding.
Front seat shit im pistol riding.
Shut your mouth hoe I know you're lying.
Clutch this toaster boy, I know you frying.
Pockets same size as a lion.
X6 baby girl i'm gliding.
Pipes in the whip, bronem sliding.
OVO 6to6, we riding.
I don't want your hoe, bitch it's iight.
Jewelry on me that'll change the climate.
Got them hoes like i'm Frankie Lymon.
Came in the game, perfect timing.
Bitch im higher than an active pilot.
Foenem drunk, we gon' start fighting.
Bitch you struck, you been hit by lightning.
Off these pills we could get violent.
Diamonds on me got your bitch excited.
Pistol party, nigga you invited.
Drop a 4 hoe, i'm dirty spriting.
Where your hoe? Cuz I know she like me.
Load the choppa we don't play round.
Stupid shit look like Atown.
Diamonds dancing on me, James Brown.
Diamonds dancing on me, James Brown.
