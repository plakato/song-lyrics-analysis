Hallelujah Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.


I'Ve heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But. You don't really care for music. Do you 

It goes like this. The fourth, the fifth
The minor, fall The major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen, chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips. She drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe I have been here. Before
I know this room. I'Ve walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble. Arch
Love is not a victory, march
It's a cold and it's a broken. Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

There was a time you. Let me know
What's real and going on below
But. Now you never show it to me. Do you 

And remember when I moved in you 
The holy dark was moving
too
And. Every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe. There'S a god above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

And. It'S not a cry. You can hear at night
It's, not somebody who's, seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah.
