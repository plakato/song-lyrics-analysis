Help Yo Self (Prod. Byous) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


Aye... wait, who the fuck you talking to?
Who the fuck is who?
I give no fuck it's me who coming thru...
Fuck that nigga and his whole crew.
I don't give no fuck you mad for what?
Because I pulled thru and killed youu.

The 240 is damn fool.
Pulled my 46 and now yo bitch can't even fuck with you.
What the fuck you mean these niggas mad because they fell thru.
What'd I try to tell you, these niggas need some help fool.
Pull up talking shit, like I always do.
Now watch me shake a spliff.
Catch a grip, see me comin' thru I smoke and switch a gear.
Who is this, talkin' shit?
Another jealous hatin' bitch, you a trip.
I'ma take a trip and smoke until I trip.
Yeah you posted in the city but, who you stayin with?
Yee ain't got no damn crib, how you think that make her feel?
How you skrt, skrt, skrt?
Yee ain't got no damn whip.
Only renting for the hour then it's back to Uber trips.
I ain't even hatin' on it nigga get it how you live.
But don't ever try to diss a damn king of this hill.
Treat yo bitch like ? and let the squad do a drill.
I go strictly for the kill, gut 'em all before I kill.
See me in my damn garage.
Fuck that rappin' shit I'm here.
I pull off, screamin' why the fuck you niggas even here.
All you hipsters gettin' hip.
And you hoes beggin' for chips.
Always hail Wulf Woe, I say the word and then we dip... you bitch.
