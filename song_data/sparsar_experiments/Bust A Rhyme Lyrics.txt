Bust A Rhyme Lyrics
by Tyler Gary.


He be that crazy haired kid with the all black get up.
Pockets stay fat like that don't do sit ups.
Born to be king like Simba, remember.
He don't do Scars so I really will end ya.
This that knick knack patty wack take ya bitch and give her back.
I'll probably feel bad the day Siri has heart attack.
Let me guess she was the apple of your eye?
Well I had to take your apple and turn her into Pi.
Thats 3.141... 5!
Seconds that it took her skanky ass to say alright lets kick it.
Legs got to rubbin' like crickets.
So much friction that the mattress start rippin.
Like, where they do that at?
Happened up inside my room in fact.
We had smoked a sack, opened snacks, then she groped my sack.
I was sad... when i had to let her go.
But i had to grab the mic and get up on my duty yo.

When I be on the mic yes I do my duty yo.
Wild up in the club like we robbin the studio.
When I be on the mic yes I do my duty yo.
Wild up in the club like we robbin the studio.

When I be on the mic yes I do my duty yo.
Shit up on the mic without using a booty hole.
This is not a robbery, your can keep your loot and gold.
But I'm taking all your attention, its so unusual.
The swanton bomber, Arnold Palmer.
Half good half evil but the dark side stronger.
Everybody asks who can last for longer.
Well the answer ain't me, last place is foreign.
Like konichiwa, a synonym for let me get up in your bra.
Hit it raw and if we're lucky feelings will not get involved.
You can find me on the planet Earth living large.
Fee fie forty bitches knocking at the front door.
It's a party, it's a party.
Tons of shitty vodka, wine, weed, and bacardi.
Find me with the hottie named Naudia.
Would have fucked her friend but she seemed way naughtier.

When I be on the mic yes I do my duty yo.
Wild up in the club like we robbin the studio.
When I be on the mic yes I do my duty yo.
Wild up in the club like we robbin the studio.

Out ya'll.
Check it out ya'll.
Just swing to the left swing to the right.
Make you feel good make you feel alright.
Out ya'll.
Check it out ya'll.
Just swing to the left swing to the right.
Make you feel good make you feel alright.
