Ain't Too Proud To Pray Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Whoa, you can call me a fool.

The robe it floated around my bed.
The night I had, has long since gone.
Well, he took them away.
Yes, I know he was there.
But I know he was there.
Whoa, you can call me a fool.
All the troubles and the pain.
Yes, he took them away.

But the memories stay.
Just open your heart and live again.
You can talk about the help you need.
Yes, I know he was there.
He's a friend indeed.
Whoa, you can call me a fool.
All the troubles and the pain.

I heard the voice and saw the face.
And he'll set you free.
And I felt no pain.
All the troubles and the pain.
But I know he was there.


But the memories stay.
And I know he was there.
Yes, I know he was there.

The night I had, has long since gone.
But I know he was there.
I'm not too proud to pray.
I'm not too proud to pray.

Well, he took them away.
And now Mr. Trouble when you come my way.
And now Mr. Trouble when you come my way.
