Critical (Madlib Remix) Lyrics
by Zion I.

*behind vocal samples from foreign movie*.

Zion I.
Planet As.
Madlib.

Zion I.
Yo check out the superb tech.
Casinh checks through dialect.
Dope as the gold around your next.
This is my manuscript to spit lyrics like I'm fat spliff.
I show the whole damn world my gift.
From pirates to speakin the pawn.
Powerful just like a pawn.
Positioned in the proper placement.
Focused like militants.
Deep in concentrational cabins.
Devise the secret plan to split atoms.
I verbalize, lust to bust, just as dangerous.
As watchin Mt. Vesuvias erupt.
Corrupt your data disk.
From the super soul powered slums.
Zion I, Planet Asia make it bump, bump.
I'm deep off in the trunk.
SWATS call it crunk.
The fifteen inch woofers make the beat go thump.
I dump clips to pros.
Orrator of goals.
The chilling is killin us with the illest type flows.

Interlude.
Ah yeah, right about now.
See what we don't wanna do.
We don't wanna do...just do shit, get up here.
That's seen and did, and you know.
Just wearin shit we wore before, things like that, ya know?
We come out to give ya a little something different.
Alright, we gonna get into a little something like this.
Whenever y'all ready.....

Planet Asia.
Yo yo.
Vocally blessed to beat you into submission.
I paddle units with pro-??? from the underside, the train.
Do not touch, I'm high voltage like the third electric.
Emergency phones needed in every tunnel for this murder method.
You're dealin with the armed forces.
We wave warmed torches.
Through the trenches of the onslaughtness.
G up, we up next, I'm an-ticipated.
Post my plan is to stand behind my ever line stated.
Delux, Aeon Fluxuate/fluctuate what I pronunciate.

*Life As It Is* baby, Zion I got me flyin high.
My mind inside music symbolic to INI.
This ain't the Sci-Fi channel.
We livin legends of the speak freak committee.
Clash The Titans through the vinyl.
When we splash the atlas with the rules of the game.
We out the old school and came to drop a jewel on your brain yo.

Interlude 2.
Since we are folks who has this mad passion for observance of music.
I am the art.
Beats Or just rap.
We're going to do something.
That's a little bit different right now already.
And as we put it together, you probably be able to dig what we mean.

Zion I.
My brother hit me on the game.
Said that we original, man.
And we manifested here to spit slang.
I thought a minute.
And let it sink deep like the Titanic.
We wider than the Ocean of Atlantic.
This typical mythical style in the West is gettin Wild.
I'm chillin like a space upon the Nile.
Reverberatin, why is you hatin, hip hop we creatin.
Across the desert sands, we be bakin.
My melanin, the key to lock, rock spots in flocks.
Walk the rugged avenue with my b-boy bop.
It's evolution, toss a pebble at the devil and smile.
I'm rebelling while propelling freestyles.

Planet Asia.
From the bottom to the top, I made alot of em drop.
Hip hop's the lifestyle of urban civilians and even cops.
No it don't stop, once again another classic.
Fantastic rap shit that make y'all MC's wanna practice.
How to lock shit down like Daddy As.
I blaze mics for days.
Hit the page like stage then burn sage.
Then engage, this ain't a phase or some played out gimmick.
That's word to Kemet for the fact that most of y'all cats is timid.
Vivid fuels, of the do's and don'ts don't apply.
To the non-compromising Planet As and Zion I.
Worldwide we're known, zones as the chosen few.
Verbal shots, I cypher rhymes to leave holes in you.

*Cut and scratched*.
Verbal assault--it's on till the death till we settle the score Inspectah.
Deck.
