Juice Part 1 Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Juice.
Yo, yo let's do it like this...yo yo.
To any nigga I'm the one on the poster holdin' Janet.
I might just be the dopest freestyle nigga on the planet.
When I rock the mic I bust it off like a gauge.
I let this niggas know freestyles ain't from a page.
They younger than models that be workin' for Calvin.
Ask em' to freestyle it's the stuff that's on they album.
Well I'ma tell em' somethin' it's time for gettin' noble-in.
When I rock mics my stuff is never written.
I wish a nigga would, try to come and test.
What I got, I put this microphone straight through his chest.
I don't care where he from, from here to Connecticut.
He get shredded with etiquette, subject and a predicate.
Never let it get, outta pocket when I rock it.
MC Juice plugged in like, a mother-F'in socket.
I don't even gotta cuss when I bust.
Turn authors to ashes and mc's to dust.
Who really think they want to get meticulous and kick this rediculous.
Rip microphone you can't freestyle and it's conspicuous.
When I freestyle I tell mc's they can't rock me.
MC Juice is dope I bash his skull like I was Rocky.
Somebody told me ever since my birth.
I was the dopest nigga off of the top on planet earth.
So if any brother wanna bring it to the Wake Up.
Bring yo' dice, bring Cognac so we can shake up.
And have a good time like J.J. Evan.
Niggas are gay as Tevin, I take em' out right at eleven o'clock.
Battles niggas don't rock right.
I get dirtier than pit bulls inside a cock fight.
Niggas think they dope I cook they styles slow and steady like a Croc pot.
They gettin' on my nerves like stupid niggas trying to cock block.
And don't try to diss me, ya' whole style whiskey.
I have a nigga tipsy like he just hung with Dizzie.
Gillespie, Crunch em' like Nestle, Elvis Prestley.

So who's the next mc to try to flex.
I'll rock microphones and always be having sex.
And next time you wanna battle we can do the constitution.
And call my DJ for an F'in Revolution.
