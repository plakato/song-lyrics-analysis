Exploding Hands Lyrics
by Volcanoes.


This house, Let go.
These walls, Won't talk.
Eyes up, Eyes down.
No sound, but the clock.

Hands shaking, No sleep.
Shirt's ripped, From my pounding heart.
Take time, To think.
Did you hear that? Did your hear that?

All I hear now are my thoughts they're screaming at me to stop thinking.
All I see now are my memories haunting every conversation.
My hands intertwined like every vein that runs throughout your body.
If I could print my heart onto vinyl it would sound like this.

Did you hear that?
