Turnt up to max.
My pockets so fat.

Pussy money weed,thts all.

Eastside they gon ride,if.
A nigga get wrong in.
They'll shoot just like I.
They say time is money.
Money is tyme, I ain't got.
Times For no games.
Leave ur body in tha rain.

Over her we got big Glocks.
Tht chop chop tht aim.
In its on lock get back.
Or get drop yo mama.
Crying he popd.
Trues on my gucci on.
Smoke a blunt I'm in my zone.
