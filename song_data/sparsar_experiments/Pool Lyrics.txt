Pool Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

Thought I'd see you around.
Not every day but pretty often.
Now that you're really leaving town.
I just wish I had been more honest.
Remember over the summer.
When I first got your number.
I thought that we could be friends.
Or maybe something better.

My heart skipped.
In New Brunswick.
You were all swimming.
And I felt so homesick.
Walked to Dev's car.
To make a phone call.
But you didn't pick up.
And I felt so desperate.
In the backseat.
Swimsuit dripping.
I made a promise.
That when we got back.
To poughkeepsie.
I wouldn't call you.
Wouldn't involve you.
I guess.
You were just too busy.

One time I showed you a song.
You only thought that.
It was kind of good.
I never played it again.
It wasn't even about you.
