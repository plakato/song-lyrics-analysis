Ain'ta Gonna Grieve Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

I long to fly away to Heaven.
Pass beyond that shining door.
See my master and my savior.
High away to Heaven soar.
I have made myself my promise.
Never again to grieve my lord.
I will live his gospel story.
Sweetest story ever told.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord no more.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord no more.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord anymore.
Not anymore.
Guess I've lived my life in blindess.
I have lived a life of wrong.
Now my heart runs full with gladness.
Singing out my gospel song.
Many a faith's too easy shaken.
Many a heart's too full of fear.
Many an eye is too mistaken.
Grievous to my savior dear.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord no more.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord no more.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord anymore.
Not anymore.
Make today this golden promise.
Make this vow forever more.
Live the story and the glory.
Dwell in peace forever more.
Make today this one agreement.
Change my thoughts from greed to love.
Enter soft into my chamber.
Pray for light to show me through.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord anymore.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord, not anymore.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord no more.
Ain'ta gonna grieve no more.
Ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord no more.
I ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord no more.
I ain'ta gonna grieve my Lord anymore.
Not anymore.
Not a gonna grieve.
Not anymore.
Not anymore.
