Katherine Lyrics

Katherine.
Produced by Vo-Kal.

The way.
All the way down.
Eyes locked.
At her waist now.
Possession.
It's her.
Profession.
The excuses made.
On the way down.
It's keeps playing over.
Tell me it's over now.
Her head on my shoulder.
I promise it's over now.

Dim these lights down low for this late night.
I'm syrup sipping while she sipping great whites.
Her cigarette still smoking in the ash tray.
But her mind still toking on this past day.

Her.
I would have never felt the temptation.
Never heard the whispers.
Her.
Never would I have tested my love.
Or heard the voices getting nearer.
I can't stop this feeling of slow motion.
Or even question the strength of my love my love.

All I could have wanted.
All I could have done.

I needed something.
That I lusted for.

It was her.
I always yearned for her.
I always dreamed of her.
Even though I have you.
I felt I needed her.

Bottles babe.
Straight to face.
Take a big swallow babe.
Not for the taste.
For the fun that we takin'.
Love we could be makin'.
Take off your shirt before.
I stain it with vacation.
Initiation with your body.
I'm just getting fucking glances.
From everybody.
I'm sorry.
I can't read these signs.
It's blurred between the lines.
And now we're fucking naked.
In the middle of the lobby.
And I.
I don't want to stop right now.
Cause they're coming after me.
But it's so hot right now.
And falling to my death.
Could be the plot right now.
But if I have a fucking say.
We won't get caught right now.
And I.
I don't think that I can stop right now.
They're so close the catching me.
Its more than hot right now.
And running out of breath.
Could be the plot right now.
But I guess I'm sticking with it.
Ain't no way that I'm forgetting.

My love.
You can't test the strength of.
My love.
Who are you to question.
My love.
But I can't even remember my love.
Oh oh X2.

Eyes closed and I'm leaning.
Eyes open I'm a free man.
Can't escape without gaining.
Everything that makes me a heathen.
I'd rather try and tame the ocean.
Than become what I'm not seeking.
I believe it.
I believe it.
I took everything that's close to you.
Stole my heart.
When I was close to you.

So I stole your faith.
What I'm supposed to do.
Was tempted.
Approachable.
I was weak enough.
You were weak enough.
And we were each finding.
We weren't enough.
And I.
Don't want you.
To cry.
It's deceiving to.
Your eyes.
To think I.
Didn't try.
But you're right.
I know you're.
Gonna cry.
In convincing you.
I'm right.
Might even save my mind.
I swear I forgot about.

Drifting away.
Further away.
Drifting away.
Deeper away  X3.
