Cold Crush Lyrics
by The Underachievers.


I put it down for my city, 
That New' New York is with me 
They, say it's like the 90's cause we bringing back the gritty 
Rep that conscious flow committee, 
We'll kill'em, with no pity 
I link my nigga Lex. You know I told him we gon' get it 
 
Cause. We blowing up 
New York back on the map, my nigga 
Shout out to Cold Crush 
Yeah. We coming up king of the city 
When. I show up 
Bring a pound to a show security. 
They know whats up 
Let me get my roll up, 
Whats the hold up, 
 
Came up from the bottom cause a nigga working hard 
Everybody want a piece, my conscious shine. Just like a star 
Now, we copping the whole thing. I blow my weed down by the jar 
And, I'm using my three eyes: a nigga watching for facade 
Lets get lit 
She like how i spit 
I told her pop a hit 
So innocent 
Put. Her on that shit, 
She went and told her friend 
I remember getting caught smoking that indo in the morning 
Told my momma best. Don'T worry, 
Ima get it! How I want it 
We all in 
Ain't, smoking that grade unless it's medicine, 
My Letterman, reek of the reefer 
Ain't tryna. Let us in 
Never sober wake up in
the morning, take a hit 
Never heard, a kind of nigga flowing like this 
Put, my city on the map. 
While I bang on these hits 
Now i laughing at these kids, while I'm passing again 
 
Elevated lifestyle 
Never aim by the prophet, if it ain't on the dial 
Rose like Roths, so they call me Sun, Child 
But. After my sesh shorty wet like the Nile 
Took us back to the green room, made her go down, 
I mean back to the team room. Now Mary go round 
Fans shed tears, screaming you're immortal 
Give me a couple more years and i would've thrown crown foreall 
Counting mils 
Stepped out the box. Now my brain builds 
That sour diesel, my brain fills, 
Live stress, free cause, pain, kills, 
Uh stack, green bills. 
From show to show 
Bout to tour the globe. 
Torch slow till your torso can't dodge those, though 
 
What, you niggas on 
I'm in the bush, with the herb, I'm puffing strong, 
Been a gift to this earth. Since I was born, 
Better know your fucking work before your gone 
Elevated go home, you can't dethrone king 
Got, my wisdom from the holy soul, the worlds spring 
Know the system want control 
But. No, i won't sink. 
Cause New York raised the golden soul through the ink
