Global Dance Lyrics
by Swindle.


Run long time and I make steps to the future.
Revolution soldier.
Military grade gloves and mask.
Riot and bazooka.
I'm in the front lines with my military guns with a G like Martin Luther.
Ready with a left and a right if time man step over the border.
Try to poison man's water.
I eat no lamb for the slaughter.
I succumb to Cajun on the corner.
We start original order.
They want to kill the mind stay local.
That's my mindset but I inform her.
I done did a dial up and vocals but our dos is global.

Choru:s.
Left right left right step in out the pub.
And we show them how to step right.
Left right left right we step in out the pub.
In long from midnight to daylight.
Tonight we walk tonight we watch no more talk no more buzz no more crap.
Let's send them back to days light past this is a global dance.

Yo step by step man regulate a global campus.
With military tanks pave the way for the next generation.
Roll out as the global champion.
General big fish to fry.
This movement's built with emotion.
Free speech and justice for everyone.
Wait til you hear my slogan.
Lightning will solve any problem.
MP's running out of option.
Take no take over me run the lands.
Same coast for the ocean.
Keep an eye when the plans in motion.
My still shape in the informant these tender minds stay focused.
Won't stop til they pop on the corner.
