Monster (freestyle) Lyrics
by Quilly.

17 I was on the Greyhound.
5am why is these smokers still Callin.
I serve niggas, curve bitches like waist trainas.
Im tryna build a empire my bitch badder than Cookie.
I made 20 thousand dollars in a playground.
Im bouta do it real big nigga gimme the loot.
Rappers washed up bubble bath get a tub for em.
Just hit the gym on you bitches and that workout.
Tell ya bitch we still got the sour and them percs out.
I put my Bitches on Uber.
Dickin down ya bitch from the rear.
Pill flippa, cake gaina.
Sellin percs in the lobby I been exchanging Armani.
Niggas tried to take me out the game Im still Ballin.
Niggas wanna live my lifestyle Young Thug on Em.
On the Road to Riches goin to Jail was my worst route.
E and Reds Wit Truck Im bouta get me a coupe.
12 for the sweatsuit nigga this my ball gear.
I mean hot as Taraji that pussy wet as Dasani.
I put my niggas on pussy.

I send the money to Jails my nigga buy you some suits.
Circle small cuz you niggas all squares.
Next month its gonn be a dime no Bargin I been.

I ain't really where i wanna be but I buzzed on Em.
I came up Cuz I stayed down.
Marshawn Lynch Im a Beast.
Pocket full of blue faces make me pull the smurfs out.
I put my Lawyer on his Feet.
Killin these niggas Life support pull the plug on em.
My oldhead really flew them birds in from A-Town.
My nigga just came home Im bouta buy him some boots.
I been plottin on ya bitch all year.
