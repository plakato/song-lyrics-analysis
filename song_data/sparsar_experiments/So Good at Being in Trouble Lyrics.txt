So Good at Being in Trouble Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time.
It's a long, sad, lonely time.
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind.
It's a strange old state of mind.

Memories, they mess with my mind.
Who am I to deny?

She was.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So bad at being in love.

Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time.
It's a long, sad, lonely time.
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind.
It's a strange old state of mind.

Memories, they mess with my mind.
Who am I to deny?

She was.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So good at being in trouble.
So bad at being in love.
