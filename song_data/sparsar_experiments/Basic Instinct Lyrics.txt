Basic Instinct Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Production by Madlib.

Yo, we got the basic instinct to keep the party live.
We got y'all niggas open, hit you with the party vibe.
I'm cruising like skating in Central Park.
Up in Venice.
Lord Quas portraying the menace.
I got the forty on my lap, my tape playing Boom Bap.
The nigga next to me talking about “Niggas acting up man I shoulda' brought.
my strap”.
I said yo chill with that, we ain't having no black-on-black.
I gave him a slap on the blackhand side, pulled out a fat sack.
Now we spark the la every day of the week.
Keep a nigga from getting tweaked up inside this piece.
I fall on niggas like a rain child.
When we're wrecking up the scene we bring the pain loud.

And wow, Quasimoto rock on and on.
Quasimoto rock on and on.
Till the break of dawn, we rock on and on.
Till the break of dawn.

Quasimoto rock on and on till the break of dawn.

Yo, we got the basic instinct to keep the party live.
We got y'all niggas open, hit you with the partyvibe.
It goes yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all.
We will leak all out the streets y'all.
Through your auditory wall, never take a fall.
Just call on Lord Quas, you know we'll always keep it raw.
Like my nigga Madlib, we manifested from the west.
No one protest, I keep myself free from stress.
Plus I drop in sight like Mike Mainieri.
I keep my cherry on top but that's a Blackberry.

But anyways, Quasimoto rock on and on.
Till the break of dawn.
come through.
with the vibe that picks ya up).
Quasimoto rock on and on.
Till the break of dawn.

Quasimoto rock on and on.
Till the break of dawn.
