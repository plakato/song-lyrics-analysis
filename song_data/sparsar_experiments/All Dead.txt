All Dead
by Queen.


She came without a farthing.
A babe without a name.
So much ado about nothing.
Is what she'd try to say.
So much ado my lover.
So many games we played.
Through every fleeted summer.
Through every precious day.

All dead, all dead.
All the dreams we had.
All dead, all dead.
And alone I'm spared.
My sweeter half instead.
All dead.
And gone.
All dead.
All dead, all dead.
All the dreams we had.
All dead, all dead.
And alone I'm spared.
My sweeter half instead.
All dead.
And gone.
All dead.

Her ways are always with me.
I wander all the while.
But please you must forgive me.
I am old but still a child.

All dead, all dead.
But I should not grieve.
In time it comes to everyone.
All dead, all dead.
But in hope I breathe.
Of course I don't believe.
You're dead.
And gone.
All dead.
And gone.
