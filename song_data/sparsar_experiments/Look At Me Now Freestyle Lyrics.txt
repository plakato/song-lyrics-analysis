Look At Me Now Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.


Young Milla 
6, Deep 
Clique that'll make them clips, speak 
Rolling with them niggas I been kicking it with strong 
So in direct comparison. Your cliques, weak 
Niggas, never really wan na flick me 
But. They wan na roll around and diss me 
But. They never really say a nigga flow, whack 
Cause. They know that every track make they chicks. Squeak 
Mixtape is a mousetrap 
Never. Do pronounce that 
All. I do is count. Stacks 
Never got ta bounce back. 
Lil' nigga keep a stack where her blouse at 
Cause. I'M bout that 
And I never be without that 
Never got ta ask where the house at 
If, you see the lake 
Then you're, seeing my estate 
Nigga fresh as shit 
But. If you're seeing Bathing Apes 
Then. You know they're not on me now 
Think about a nigga with a flow so cold 
That. It don't grow old, but a nigga. So pro 
That I never talk shit and I never walk past 
A nigga like you cause you niggas walk last 
My whip sexy watch. It transform like Megan Fox 
One man, rock band tell'em, Saegan Rox 
I'm 6'7, but my whips 211 
Never lay a finger. It'Ll be a 187 
I'm, a Motherfucking problem. 
Tell a motherfucker solve'em 
Or get a motherfucker off a beat 
I'm attacking the track. 
With immaculate swagg 
How a nigga come off so sweet 
I'm, a killer for real 
I, be feeling for deals. 
But, you niggas, don't know my name 
YM the king 
Rollin with the queen 
In a whip colored like cocaine, 
, 
I'm, good 
, 
Back to the topic. 
Actually forgot it 
Hoes money, I'm the shit. Okay, I'm reminded 
The way. I flip the words Armando Estrada 
Looking over states. You can call me Nevada, 
, Wan na get to Letterman 
To, kick it for the betterment 
Of innocent Americans 
Who stuck on the irrelevant 
Unintelligent niggas who be selling this 
2011 new Nelly shit, 
 
Oh. Yes, I did 
My baby's due in may lord bless my kids .
 Oh yes, I'm is 
I'm curling the world Exxon Valdez, 
Kill opposition, 
Fuck Competition, 
From, my composition, 
Lyrical ignition 
Flipping, the flame 
I'm kicking the'caine, 
Thats, keeping them Vegas chicks, going insane, 
A nigga. So vain. I'M probably listening to this shit right now, 
 
Then. I kill it again, 
I'm in it to win. 
Y'All niggas is in it to witness the end. 
Wait 
And, y'all ain't. Never in the winners circle 
Your wins low. I finish: Urkels 
I make your girls pussy talk that cats meow 
Used to look at me sideways. Well, look at me! Now
