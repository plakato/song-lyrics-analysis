Look At Me Now Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.


Young Milla.
6 Deep.
Clique that'll make them clips speak.
Rolling with them niggas I been kicking it with strong.
So in direct comparison your cliques weak.
Niggas never really wanna flick me.
But they wanna roll around and diss me.
But they never really say a nigga flow whack.
Cause they know that every track make they chicks squeak.
Mixtape is a mousetrap.
Never do pronounce that.
All I do is count stacks.
Never gotta bounce back.
Lil' nigga keep a stack where her blouse at.
Cause I'm bout that.
And I never be without that.
Never gotta ask where the house at.
If you see the lake.
Then you're seeing my estate.
Nigga fresh as shit.
But if you're seeing Bathing Apes.
Then you know they're not on me, now.
Think about a nigga with a flow so cold.
That it don't grow old, but a nigga so pro.
That I never talk shit, and I never walk past.
A nigga like you, cause you niggas walk last.
My whip sexy watch it transform like Megan Fox.
One man rock band tell 'em Saegan Rox.
I'm 6'7 but my whips 211.
Never lay a finger it'll be a 187.
I'm a Motherfucking problem.
Tell a motherfucker solve 'em.
Or get a motherfucker off a beat.
I'm attacking the track.
With immaculate swagg.
How a nigga come off so sweet.
I'm a killer for real.
I be feeling for deals.
But you niggas don't know my name.
YM the king.
Rollin with the queen.
In a whip colored like cocaine.

I'm good.

Back to the topic.
Actually forgot it.
Hoes, money I'm the shit okay I'm reminded.
The way I flip the words Armando Estrada.
Looking over states you can call me Nevada.
Wanna get to Letterman.
To kick it for the betterment.
Of innocent Americans.
Who stuck on the irrelevant.
Unintelligent niggas who be selling this.
2011 new Nelly shit.

Oh yes I did.
My baby's due in may lord bless my kids.
Oh yes I'm is.
I'm curling the world Exxon Valdez.
Kill opposition.
Fuck Competition.
From my composition.
Lyrical ignition.
Flipping the flame.
I'm kicking the 'caine.
Thats keeping them Vegas chicks going insane.
A nigga so vain I'm probably listening to this shit right now.

Then I kill it again.
I'm in it to win.
Y'all niggas is in it to witness the end.
Wait.
And y'all ain't never in the winners circle.
Your wins low I finish Urkels.
I make your girls pussy talk, that cats meow.
Used to look at me sideways well look at me now.
