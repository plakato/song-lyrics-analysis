Straight Lines Lyrics
by Wood.

Well, I tried so hard but it was not enough.
I guessed wrong and I messed up.
But I think I still believe.
When you walk in a straight line.
You don't have to worry.
When you walk in a straight line.
Things get out your way.
When you walk in a straight line.
You don't have to worry.
When you walk in a straight line.
You can face the day.
Down by the river stands a man.
Trouble on his mind, running out of plans.
But I think I still believe.
When you walk in a straight line.
You don't have to worry.
When you walk in a straight line.
Things get out your way.
When you walk in a straight line.
You don't have to worry.
When you walk in a straight line.
You can face the day.
