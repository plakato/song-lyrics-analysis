Withdrawals Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.


You were that whiskey running through my veins.
You were that first sweet taste of Mary Jane.
All alone in the darkness watching my hands shake.
But they don't have a rehab for heartbreak.

It's your blue sundress with the strap falling off of your shoulder.
It's that all night moonlight drive, you saying baby pull over, pull over.
It's that long kiss barely coming up for air.
Had to have you anytime and everywhere.

Whoa, I bang my head against the moon.
I bang my fist against the wall.
You always used to get me high.
Now all I do is crash and fall.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
Yeah you got me going through ‘em.

It's the rain on the window with your body wrapped tight around me.
It's that lightning flash in your eyes make me want you so badly, madly.
You're the ghost that's still sleeping in my bed.
A song I can't turn off in my head.
You're the perfect storm, yeah baby, and I'm still drowning.

Whoa, I bang my head against the moon.
I bang my fist against the wall.
You always used to get me high.
Now all I do is crash and fall.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
Yeah you got me going through ‘em.

I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals, yeah.

I bang my head against the moon.
I bang my fist against the wall.
You always used to get me high.
Now all I do is crash and fall.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
I'm going through withdrawals.
Yeah you got me going through ‘em.
