Doin' My Thang Lyrics
by Zion I.


Now in a world full of pain, hard strugglin' stressed.
The Buddha say your soul sufferin', I'm still here blessed.
Just to breath, please believe I'm way out west.
Oakland to be exact, where the pimps still rest.
And the mean mugs and thugs that test your chest.
It'd be so easy for me to be a pess-I-mist.
But I'm still here rhyming', still chart climbing.
Addicted to the game like I'm on cane vibin'.
It's really all organic, so mamma don't panic.
Your son ain't a crack fiend, even though I back lean.

The mega lord mix board, sword with a sheen.
Unseen in the night, while you sleep without light.
I slave to the beat, twist it til it feel tight.
Then take it to the sound proof booth with a mic.
The only thing in life that always made me feel right.

Some my people got high, sold they soul for spit.
Some drink water fire, work to that brink.
Some make hard love til it starts to sting.
I stay rymin', doin' my thing.
Some shorties get smart, givin' brain to kids.
Some homies get live with their one night fling.
Some even go to church, prayin' on they sin.
I stay rymin', doin' my thing.

In school I did cool, always got them grades.
But I acted real bad so the teachers say:.
What ya gonna do boy, you gotta go get paid.
Man I be rymin', doin' my thing.
And when I wrote they would joke that I wouldn't be shit.
Caus we was rocking high fashion, all counterfeit.
Tryin' to learn a new dance step, and feel legit.
Get a girl with a booty, and real big tits.
We was crazy home boy, my mind was warped.
By a 40oz bottle, speakin' tales.
Too Short.
What's my taste is yours, didn't know what for.
Just wanna be a rapper, wanna go on tour.
Hit hoochies in a hojo, life.
moves slowmo.
Fast forward today, on planes doin' promo.
Now ya see who I am.
MC to the heart, I'mma funk the jam.

I coulda been a doctor, or psychologist.
But it wouldn't make me happy, I chose to bust.
Roll with gamblers and hustlers.
Cats who grind all the time, drink and cuss.
But there's something beautiful, it's right beneath my touch.
It's hard to understand a certain kind of rush.
That I get from my lifestyle, struggling trife style.
Long way to go, happily I walk a long mile.
I'll... be... coming to town.
God gave me many blessings, I'mma spread 'em around.
When you see us in the club imma break shit down.
And I'll be rymin', doin' my thing.
It's my thing.
