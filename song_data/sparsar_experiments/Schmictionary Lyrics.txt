Schmictionary Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

I want to take.
Pictures of you.
Every single moment.
But especially in the morning.
When sun's pouring.
Through your windows.
But i don't need photographs.
I know just what you look like.
Your image is internalized.
You go wherever I go.

Who loves you baby?

I need new adjectives.
To try to describe you.
Words are so meaningless.
When they're applied to you.
Dictionary schmictionary.
I need something better.
Than these.
Insufficient combinations.
Of some stupid letters.

Who loves you baby?

I like you.
Completely.
Every last.
Aspect of your.
Entire being.
Every day we.
Spend together.
It gets easier to see.
That you may not.
Be perfect.
But you're perfect.
For me.
