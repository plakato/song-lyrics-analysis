Q & A Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Bae you need get some act right.
And I don't want to talk about last night.

Cause you know you can get that last slice.
And that's light.
You know I'm just not used to answering questions.
Out of all of these women girl you was the best one.
And we official like ref girl, we could bet some.

Cause I never bet on my ladies.
And girl you forever was crazy.
But you forever my lady.
I never would play you.
I never would play you.
Girl I've been saving to take you to all of the places I never could take you.
And I never said I was ready.
I'm working so hard to put bread on the table.
Fuck all your friends girl we fed off them haters.

And you fed up with favors.

But I got shit set up for later.
So hold up.

Feel like.
You feel like I'm not sure.
I said what's mine is yours.
You said I made you insecure.
If answer all your questions just don't say you got one more.
No more questions.
No more questions.
Just don't lie to me, lie to me oh no.
I'm no player.
No more questions.

No more drama.
Girl I'm a boss and I know you a rider, know you a rider.
Be mine solution I got enough problems.
I did things I ain't proud of.
But if you got me then I got us.
I'm no longer where I was, word to mama.
How you always come with this shit.
Like damn girl I ain't even diss shit.
Why you let them lames gas you.
Tell 'em niggas pull up at the Quiktrip.

Girl you know I pull up on you with the quickness.

Trying crop a nigga out like a picstich.
Steady worrying about the hoes on my hit list.
But you know nigga don't love you like I do.

Feel like.
You feel like I'm not sure.
I said what's mine is yours.
You said I made you insecure.
If answer all your questions just don't say you got one more.
No more questions.
No more questions.
Just don't lie to me, lie to me.
I'm no player.
No more questions.

Baby you need get some act right.
And I don't want to talk about last night.
You fucking right.
You know I just not used to answering questions.
Girl I'm just not used to answering questions.
