A New England Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.


I was twenty one years when I wrote this song.
I'm twenty two now, but I won't be for long.
People ask when will you grow up to be a man.
But all the girls I loved at school.
Are already pushing prams.

I loved you then as I love you still.
Though I put you on a pedestal.
They put you on the pill.
I don't feel bad about letting you go.
I just feel sad about letting you know.

I don't want to change the world.
I'm not looking for a new England.
I'm just looking for another girl.
I don't want to change the world.
I'm not looking for a new England.
I'm just looking for another girl.

I loved the words you wrote to me.
But that was bloody yesterday.
I can't survive on what you send.
Every time you need a friend.

I saw two shooting stars last night.
I wished on them but they were only satellites.
Is it wrong to wish on space hardware.
I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care.

I don't want to change the world.
I'm not looking for a new England.
I'm just looking for another girl.
I don't want to change the world.
I'm not looking for a new England.
I'm just looking for another girl.
Looking for another girl.
Looking for another girl.
Looking for another girl.
