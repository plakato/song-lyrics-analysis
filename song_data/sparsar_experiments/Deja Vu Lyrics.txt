Deja Vu Lyrics
by ViZion.


Same old games, looking in my phone, it's the same old names.
I've been going hard just like cold paint.
Trying to keep it closed to these hoes, cause I know.
That I fuck and duck 'em, and change clothes, stone cold.
Yea I roll, blow o's.
I get high no joke and we fly, no coach.

Then you came on through.
In a summer haze, like better days do.
I approached you, and you brushed me off.
But I loved that shit, cause you played your cards.
So I played it cool.
Let dudes make moves while I chilled with my crew.
Got faded too.
'Til you came back through, like deja vu.

It came in like a wave.
Same way went away.
One night, me and you.
Memories in the nude.
It came in like a rush.
Every time we touched.
Underneath the moon.
Now it's gone, like deja vu.

No clothes, yea I love to see it when you stop and pose.
Like a private show.
Get up on this pole in my sunset home.
We'll be up all night till the cocks come crow.
And I hold you close.
And I love you slow 'til you tell me go.
Then I'm in that zone.
Getting all up in it, have you hitting high notes.
It's funny how we fit, like a puzzle piece.
Underneath these sheets, it's so easy to believe.
Nothing is forever though, or so they preach.
You'll be gone in the morning, yea, life's a beach.
But I live by the sea.
So if you waan' go dipping under stars, I'm willing.
I don't do this with these women, but girl I swear that you're different.
You're magnificent.

It came in like a wave.
Same way went away.
One night, me and you.
Memories in the nude.
It came in like a rush.
Every time we touched.
Underneath the moon.
Now it's gone, like deja vu.

Girl you know, I've gotta go.
Yea you know, tomorrow I'll be gone.
And the sun is coming up.
But in the sky, these stars shine on.
Let it go, and let it show.
Yea I know, this feeling is not wrong.
And the sun, is coming up.
And memories live on.

It came in like a wave.
Same way went away.
One night, me and you.
Memories in the nude.
It came in like a rush.
Every time we touched.
Underneath the moon.
Now it's gone, like deja vu.
