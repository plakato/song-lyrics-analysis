NES Hard Lyrics
by Swych.


Yeah, yeah, uh.

Late nights, mind right, grind right.
Might sound like, the rap game got me feeling like the zomb' type.
Vamp life what they screaming right now right?
But it's funny because their life not my life.
You can't tell me how to live it.
Tell me what to love and I'll be absolutely livid.
Can't control my soul, pardon my addiction.
Hat to my past, 2Pac in my system.

When you working this hard, you.
Get to do what you want, so.
I'm a do what I want, now.
She gon' do what I want now.
I been going so hard, so.
I'm a do what I want, I said.
I'm a do what I want, now.
I know that this what I want now.

Yo, uh.
Hard's a understatement, hardly underrated.
Shoutout to my future haters that still hope I make it.
That's okay I'm used to fakers overpopulated.
People stupid, saying I had to go pop to make it.
Still spit above 99% of them.
Shorty used to turn me down, now she want to turn me up.
I ain't gon' sweat her now, y'all be on that Drizzy stuff.
Stacks so fat that I got to get my skinnies custom made.
Eating until my guts in pain.
Don't nobody ever ask if it was rough today.
But I'm fine now, yeah I'm fine now.
Since life's a nightmare, I never lie down.
Keep it so trill, never lie now, I could die now.
So I'll sleep when I die, like the bleach.
Like the beat that I'm on so just please.
Do a solid for me.
Don't ever say nobody going harder than me!

They just don't get it, they'll never get it.
But it's okay though, I never sweat it.
I always go as hard as it gets.
And lately I been putting more than 100% in, uh.

They gon' talk anyway, make them talk everyday.

Maybe it ain't so bad.
They gon' talk if you doing good, they gon' talk if you doing bad.
So on every track I snap like someone talked about my dad.
Know he looking down at me like he sad.
But he proud and my fan's screaming loud, so it's all good.
