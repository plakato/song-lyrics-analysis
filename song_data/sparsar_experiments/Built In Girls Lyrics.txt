Built In Girls Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Sweet pretty things set out in motion.
Painted to doll and sleek with grace.
The city has no real need to be nervous it's seen it all before.
Measured out life in lipstick and lashes.
It's easy when you've been given such charms.
Tease a little smile, pull back your hair.
Toss around, walk around, act like you care.
It's built in girls so naturally.
Built in girls and it's all that they'll ever need.
Just turn around and tell me you love me.
Spit out the words that you'll make sincere.
There is no time for decisions or countless revisions.
I've heard them all before.
So don't pretend to be so true when you got him coming through.
When everything you wanted has turned to nothing more.
Don't say i never warned you, it's well known.
Something has been happening here for years.
I'm not worried i can always come back crawling to you.
Begging for forgiveness in the honest degrees.
Talking through some circles with the greatest of ease.
These are the assumptions and these are the times.
