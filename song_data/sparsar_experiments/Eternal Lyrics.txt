Eternal Lyrics
by Swing Dee Diablo.

Prelude}.
Yeah,What Up Ya'll?
Swing Dee Diablo.
This Song Is Dedicated To The Ladies.
You Know what I Mean?
There's No Gimmicks.
Nothing Crazy Going On.
I Love You Guys.
I Love All Of You.
You Know What I Mean?
No Matter What Your Shape,Size.
Eye Color,How You Dress.
I Don't Give A Shit.
I Just Love You For Who You Are.
You Know What I'm Saying?
So Check It Out.

1st Verse.

Baby Girl You Be My Queen.
And Swing Dee Be Your Pharaoh.
Pretty Black Girl On My Side.
Like I'm Robert De Niro.
I Laugh At These Drug Addicts.
They Be Popping They Molly.
Cause I Pop Molly.
But I Mean That White Girl.
I Pop Her Body.
Asian Woman,Open Up Your Pool.
It's Time For Swimming.
You Gonna Love Me Long Time.
After I'm All Up In It.
To My Latin Ladies.
Every time You Talk.
You Drive Me crazy.
Puerto Rican you out Cold.
But You Hotter than Hades.
I Swear To God.
I Love All Of Ya'll.
Everybody Can Have it.
I Can't Wait To See Your Big Booty.
Silly Puddy And Grab It.
Let's Keep it Simple.
Baby Girl I'm Not Playing With You.
Love your Style.
I Love Your Walk.
I Love your Smile.
And Them Beautiful Dimples.
I Love The Way That You Do Your Thing.
In Your Future There's A Wedding Ring.
Your Ex Man Just Leave Him Be.
I'm All You'll Need,Baby.
You'll Soon See.
Let's Stay Together.
We'll Never Die.
We'll Live Forever.
You Wanna Find Me.
Here's Where I'll Be.
Inside Of You.
Eternity.

I Promise I'll Never Hurt You.
I Promise I'll Never Desert You.
I Will Love You For Ever.
Because Our Love Is Eternal.
Don't Let The Troubles Of The World.
Come Home and Concern You.
Cause Together We Hot Like Infernos.
Our love Is Eternal.
I Promise I'll Never Hurt You.
I Promise I'll Never Desert You.
I Will Love You For Ever.
Because My Love Is Eternal.
Don't Let The Troubles Of The World.
Come Home and Concern You.
Cause Together We Hot Like Infernos.
Our love Is Eternal.

Baby Girl I Love You.
All I Wanna Do Is Taste you.
You My Favorite Flavor of Love.
But I Ain't Got Time To Date You.
I Just Want You To Feel Me.
And Baby Girl.
I Know You Do.
Sugar Walls In Candy Land.
Every Time I Make Love To You.
And I Can See You From The Stage.
You Be Rapping My Lyrics.
And I Can Visualize The Way U Look.
When I'm Up In It.
Get To Your House.
Roll A Blunt.
Then I Pass On Out In You.
After A Hour Of Stroking.
No Need To Stay.
And Baby I Won'T Pretend To.
I Love The way You Shake Your Ass.
So Shake It,Shake It.
Shake it Fast.
All Them other N*%$AZ is Trash.
Like Keith Sweat I'm A Make It Last.
A!!!, You My Sexy Mommy.
Let's Do It Like Pam and Tommy.
Let's Do It Like Paris Did.
In That Video.
But With Better Lighting.
Oh,So Exciting,Your Body.
So Inviting.
Pull Your Panties.
I Play In It.
I Lay In It.
Then Come? Inside It.
Let's Stay Together.
We'll Never Die.
We'll Live Forever.
You Wanna Find Me.
Here's Where I'll Be.
Inside Of You.
Eternity.

Hook Repeats.

I Promise I'll Never Hurt You.
I Promise I'll Never Desert You.
I Will Love You For Ever.
Because Our Love Is Eternal.
Don't Let The Troubles Of The World.
Come Home and Concern You.
Cause Together We Hot Like Infernos.
Our love Is Eternal.
I Promise I'll Never Hurt You.
I Promise I'll Never Desert You.
I Will Love You For Ever.
Because My Love Is Eternal.
Don't Let The Troubles Of The World.
Come Home and Concern You.
Cause Together We Hot Like Infernos.
Our love Is Eternal.
