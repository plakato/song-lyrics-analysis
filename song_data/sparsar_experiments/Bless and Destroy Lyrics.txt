Bless and Destroy Lyrics
by Swollen Members.

MadChild.
I give you the creeps.
My style's sickening.
First the awakening.
Prepare for the quickening.
Battle sole controller.
There can only be one.
Drink a can of Pepsi-cola.
While I'm walking on the sun.
I'm ill.
Equipped with interchangeable weaponry.
Three mystical blades.
And multiple personalities.
Come crisp with raspiness.
Witchcraft to grasp this.
Depth of perception.
Schizophrenic perfectionist.
My direction is out there past the stars.
Part beast, with powerful jaws and sharp claws.
Exceptional in this physical existence.
Suck on my potential.
And choke on this persistence.
For instance I'm the light.
That's shining in the distance.
Palm trees pina colodas.
Citrus and incense.
I'm intense.
Joker laugh get broke in half.
Like Sylvester Stallone.
Comfortable, stroke the shaft.
No doubt I'm immaculate.
I'm tackling those.
Cackling crows attacking.
And I'm packing in shows.
Transform, but still come with fantastic form.
Ancient war chants.
Clips surpass the norm.
Windstorm that is creating a god-awful mess.
Now take a shot at the best.
I got a lot off my chest.
And this is hot off the press.
And it sizzles and scorches.
I scorch you down in deep dark caves lead by torches.

Prevail.
Yo, man how ya feeling?
Man for realla I could kill a gorilla.
I'm a breed of the last to see men.
In activation on a planet of freaks.
I frequent hollows and abandoned hallways.
And the poisons in my abdomen.
So watch my movement always.
I take the things out of my old armor.
Remove the rings out of my old grenade parlor.
I stay sharper than the tails from the partner.
And twice as sharp as the reason.
The hands of the hooded wanderer.
Some will wonder how much longer.
Before the berserkers conquer.
I promise my attack on all those who sponsor.
The material put out by monsters.
In appearance of king Richard the third.
My style comes precured.
There's no further twisting necessary.
There's many ways to enter Deferrin's embassy.
And take your place on the last line of security.
Renege from him's a blasphemy.
Swine like red red wine and beads of rosary.
