You Don't Mess Around with Jim Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


Uptown got its hustlers.
The Bow'ry got its bums.
The 42nd Street got Big Jim Walker.
He's a pool shootin' son of a gun.
Yeah, he's big and dumb as a man can come.
But he's stronger than a country hoss.
When the bad folks all get together at night.
You know they all call Big Jim 'Boss' just because.

And everybody say Jack.
You don't tug on Superman's cape.
You don't spit into the wind.
You don't pull the mask off the old lone ranger.
And you don't mess around with Jim.

Well, out of South Alabama came a country boy.
Said he was looking for a man named Jim.
Hey, I'm a pool shootin' boy, my name is Willie McCoy.
At home they just call me Slim.
Hey, I'm lookin' for the king of Forty Second Street.
Drivin' a drop top Cadillac.
Last week he took all my money and it may sound funny.
But I've come to get my money back.

Well, a hush fell over the room.
Jimmy came boppin' in off the street.
And when the cuttin' was done the only part that wasn't bloody.
Was the soles of the big man's feet.
Well, he was cut in 'bout a hundred places.
And he was shot in a couple more.
And you better believe they sang a diff'rent kind of story.
When Big Jim hit the floor.

Yeah, Big Jim found out where it's at.
Yeah, he's hustling people, strange to you.
Even if you do got a two-piece custom made pool cue.
