The Change-Up Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.

Produced by Mura Masa.

Now I wanna tell you that there's nothing more ridiculous as someone dealing.
with fire.

Conquer life through a drop of hope.
You don't need the pope to cleanse your soul.
View the world through a wider scope.
And you will see that freedom's a jail.
Don't stop drop the soap.
It's hard to stay tranquil.
When men of power hold rifles.
Poisoned by hate and greed.
We're disposable once they get what they need.
If these walls could speak, they'd say swim good.
Where would I run?
Where would I hide?
What is life?
Who am I?
When I'm just â€¦ a victim to my mind.
A Victim to my Mind.
A Victim to my Mind.
A Victim to my Mind.
A Victim to my Mind.
