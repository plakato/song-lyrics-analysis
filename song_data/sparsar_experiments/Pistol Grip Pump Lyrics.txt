Pistol Grip Pump Lyrics
by Volume 10.


I was raised in the hood, called... what the diff?
Whether brothers in the hood be chivalrous.
So I rest defense on my ligaments.
Pistol grip pump on my lap, risking it.
So life living it, never giving back.
Too late for slipping, so slack... up.
It's on my lap, its on your lips so track shit.
A steel dick full clip for punk butts.
All I'm saying there ain't no question who the man is.
In my Civic or in this showbiz.
I shit a fool, I cut a fool, come on, what you say?
I think I can take care of all you motherfuckers no delaying, right away.

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times....
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times....
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times....
Niggas fuck with other niggas' shit but they don't fuck with mines.

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times.
Cause tricks be out for your blind side.
Never understood it, but remember I showed you that.
In the nineties you gotta look over your shoulder strap.
Well that ain't nothing but just for getting high.
And a cop ain't give a shit for just passing you by.
If you're in trouble, on the double best to call your pals.
If you ain't got none, bitch, I got- I got a million styles.
Around me.
Are we getting along?
We family, we better be.

Aiight man....

Rhyming is a cinch, son of a bitch I'm rich.
But that don't mean you can gank me, cause all my peoples is pimps.
Players, hustlers, killers, all been through the filter.
I hang with my dogs man, fuck a gorilla.
Iller, cadaver, hill-a, beans.
Show me have a enough steam, to blow me up, run up, what up, shut up.
A trick get the buckshots.
Your daughter get the love, a lot.
Until you're outtie, at the cemetery.
Man, she loves me, and not a single solitary witness to the party.
And if you didn't know, should've asked somebody.

Pistol grip pump.
Pistol grip pump.
Pistol grip pump.
Yeah.
Pistol grip pump.
Pistol grip pump.
Pistol grip pump.
Ay man, Ay....
