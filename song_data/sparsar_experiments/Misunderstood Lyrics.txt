Misunderstood Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


Oooooooo.
Waaaaa yeah.

A lot of people call it his story.
It's only right to call it my story.
Cause I been through a lot.
And thought it'd never stop.

With everything that I got I held on with.
Ohhh.
Like being taken from my comfort zone to.
A total stranger's place that they call home.
So I put up my guard.

Had to ignore my heart.
That's when I grew up a lot.
But now the cost is....

I may have a problem with expressing my opinions.
And a million other things.
I just failed to mention.

Whenever I cry and.
Nobody was there to dry my eyes.
Like it was my fault that nobody told me to hold on tight.

I'm just misunderstood.
Tryna make you love me any way I could.
Maybe one day you will see.
That there's so much more to me.

I'm just misunderstood.
Do the opposite of what you think I should.
So there's nothing else to do but to live misunderstood.

I often think about what it'd be like.
If I could push rewind to save his life.
Would everything be the same or.
Would it turn out this way?

I still harbor the pain from you missing.
Cause when you left, she put the blame on me.
Mentally, emotionally, physically.
Thought it was what I deserved.
Thought I was pleasing her.
I learned to live with hurt.
But now the cost is.

I'm just misunderstood.
Tryna make you love me anyway I could.
Maybe one day you will see.
That there's so much more to T.

I'm just misunderstood.
Do the opposite of what y'all think I should.
So there's nothing else to do.
But to live misunderstood.
