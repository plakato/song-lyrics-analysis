Young Man Lyrics
by 3 Melancholy Gypsies.


When I was a young man growing up I could see I would be the one.
One of many headed towards the sun.
Cause the suns burning in our heart.

At one time.
Color inside the lines were all the rules I had to take.
Sitting Indian style, colorful carpet under my shade.
Once I learned what I loved I knew I controlled my own plate.
Third grade started falling for the dames.
Started calling out names.
Fourth through eighth were just a bunch of innocent childish games.
Everyday in between been breaking on a balance beam.
Taking me on a roller coaster faster than the speed of light.
Sending up prayers hoping God catches them swift and slight.
Giving me heavy handed insight on my chosen life.
Serving up cyclones injecting what I've learned into rhyme.
Yet everyday is just a march on a dime through time.

When I was a young man growing up.
I could see.
I would be the one.
One of many headed towards the sun.
Cause the sun is burning in our heart.
When I was a young man growing up.
I could see.
I would be the one.

Scarub.
Born alone die alone.
Between the end and the beginning.
Life plays out like the scales of a xylophone.
Already knew right from wrong.
So my tendencies to fail were less.
Knew I was blessed and pushed right along.
From an early age they thought I was different.
Had a more mature approach about me.
They labeled me gifted.
Yeah, I got a pocket piece.
But rarely keep a close watch of the times.
Rather explore my mind and what's caught up in it.
I ain't crazy y'all just scared.
And that's the truth.
Seems like the ones who make it through the same ones breaking the rules.
I ain't one for authority and I ain't no menace.
Was put here with a task to finish.
Let's get to business.

When I was a young man growing up.
I could see.
I would be the one.
One of many headed towards the sun.
Cause the sun is burning in our heart.
When I was a young man growing up.
I could see.
I would be the one.

MURS.
One of these dudes was not like the others.
But I never ran for cover.
Cause I knew I never was.
In the hood they used to point and say, There go weird cuz..
With my dreadlocks high on an underground buzz.
Backpack on.
Headphones on 10.
And not much changed.
We became grown men.
I'm still hella weird.
Just tighter with my raps.
And they still grindin'.
Ridin' in the trap.
But the bond that we got goes beyond all that.
Of that obstacles that you face when you're young, black.
We do a different dance but it's too the same drum.
Trying not to get burnt by the flames of the sun.

When I was a young man growing up.
I could see.
I would be the one.
One of many headed towards the sun.
Cause the sun is burning in our heart.
When I was a young man growing up.
I could see.
I would be the one.
