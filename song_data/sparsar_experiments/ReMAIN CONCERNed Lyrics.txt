ReMAIN CONCERNed Lyrics
by Running Legion.


I talk like Pac, spit fire, it'll burn ya lips.
I came to kill bars, flow well, and murder shit.
I shoot at anything red playing games and Crip.
Walk, you're acting selfish, something's going on, I smell fish.
Motions going through my brainwave.
Talented enough to make the insane behave.
Rain again on my parade.
Fame's the same as hell, no glass of lemonade.
I remain plain with Mary Jane in my brownies for aid.
As I begin my reign on the rap game, laid.
Back, I back up and see myself begin to fade.
Constant battles, I'm sane but Wayne went on a raid.
He thinks he can kill me, him and 2Chainz.
Tried to destroy my brain with detail but failed.
Bars is stale.

Rolling tress they overgrown.
Making cheese that provolone.
We in the paper, cigarillo.
Rap to make bread, we don't pay no bills yo.
Here's the deal yo.
I got about 15 niggas down ready to ride if you down to slide.
We can take this motherfucker outside and let it fly.
Tripping off hoes why you niggas do that.
It's just gonna hold you back.
Why not stack.
Get that paper.
Take off running and don't look back.
Niggas sell crack and then they die.
Nigga start rapping and then he die.
Next thing he know, he in the sky.
Talking to 2Pac like thank god.

Damn.
