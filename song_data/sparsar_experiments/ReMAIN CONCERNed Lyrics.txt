ReMAIN CONCERNed Lyrics
by Running Legion.


I talk like Pac spit fire, it'll burn ya, lips, 
I came to kill, bars flow well and murder. Shit 
I, shoot at anything red playing games and Crip 
Walk you're acting selfish something's, going on. I smell fish 
Motions, going through my brainwave, 
Talented enough to make the insane behave. 
Rain again on my parade 
Fame's the same as hell. No glass of lemonade 
I remain plain with Mary Jane in my brownies for aid 
As. I begin my reign on the rap game laid 
Back. I back up and see myself begin to fade 
Constant battles, I'm sane, but Wayne went on a raid. 
He thinks he can kill me him and 2Chainz 
Tried to destroy my brain with detail, but failed 
Bars is stale 
 
Rolling tress. They overgrown 
Making cheese that provolone 
We in the paper cigarillo 
Rap to make bread. We don't pay no bills. Yo 
Here's the deal yo 
I got about 15 niggas down ready to ride. If you down to slide 
We can take this motherfucker outside and let it fly 
Tripping off hoes. Why you niggas do that 
It's! Just gon na hold you back! 
Why not stack 
Get, that paper 
Take off running and don't look back, 
Niggas sell crack and then they die 
Nigga start rapping and then he die 
Next thing. He know he in the sky 
Talking to 2Pac like thank god, 
 
Damn
