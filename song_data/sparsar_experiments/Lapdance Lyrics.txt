Lapdance Lyrics
by Vita.

Dirty Dog.
I'm, I'm a dirty dog.
I'm a dirty dog.
I'm, I'm a dirty dog.
Dirty Dog.
I'm a dirty dog.
Dirty Dog.

I'm an outlaw.
Quick on the draw.
Somethin' you've never seen before.
And I dare a mother fucker to come in my face.
I got somethin' chrome.
And I got it from home.
And it ain't a microphone.
And I dare a mother fucker to come in my face.
It's so real.
How I Feel.
Cause this society.
That makes a nigga want to kill.
I'm just straight ill.
Ridin' my motorcycle down the streets.
While politicians is soundin' like strippers to me.
They keep sayin' but I don't want to hear it.

Ooh baby you want me?
Ooh baby you want me?
Ooh baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free.
Now you can get this lap dance here for free.
Now you can get this lap dance here for free.
Oooh baby you want me?
Now you can get this lap dance here for free.

It's a raw night.
Who wants to bar fight?
Well come on alright.
And I dare a mother fucker to come in my face.
Baseball bats.
I got somethin' for that.
It goes bla ka ka kat.
So I dare a motherfucker to come in my face.
It's so real, how I feel.
Cause this society, hat makes a nigga want to kill.
I'm just straight ill.
Ridin' my motorcycle down the streets.
While politicians is soundin' like strippers to me.
They keep sayin' but I don't want to hear it.

When you think of Harvey, think of a Harley.
Blue denim, spiked wrists and gone be.
Lap-screws and tattoos that's all me.
Two guns, both arm's spinnin' like Fonzie.
You can find me drunk, whip it it might crash.
Or find me chillin with crackers, who like thrash.
Find me in court smokin' that nice grass.
Burnin' the flag, all in the name of white trash.
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm I'm lawly baby.
Fuck with me? Not hardly baby.
And you know the flow unguardly baby.
So lets party baby.
Chicks nick-name me prador, they get high of my dick.
I take 'em to my home, they call it the cock pit.
Time for take off, their panties they drop quick.
Now that's first class fuckin, ain't that some fly shit?
