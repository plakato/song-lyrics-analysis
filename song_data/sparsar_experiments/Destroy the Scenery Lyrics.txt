Destroy the Scenery Lyrics
by United Kingdom.


United Kingdom... the UK.
We're bringing fire war.
To those that oppose against the chosen.

Timbo King - Royal Fam.
As the sun rises, heat rays strikes the light geysers.
Vision makes me see all snakes through their disguises.
Who's the wisest, you'll be under, we'll be overstanding.
The four devils don't exist in our cipher.
We have to fight you, free from dumb, true and lighter.
Knowledge provider, my limitation is above water.
These are the days of the last quarter.
Staying in tune, observing all aspects of life.
Intelligent minds building electrical powerlines.
Magnetic attracts metal made of steel.
Disconnect your internet, burn corporate seals.
Islams is shield, when we fight against satin.
Allah u Akbar, time for revelations.
I'll bomb nations who deal with paganism.
False teaching, were here to civilize a whole region.
Right and exact, my brain contains inner, outer tissues.
While you be popping pistols, we be launching nuclear missles.
Crimson Tide, we react like Denzel.

Inhale and exhale, we prevail.

Snuggle-Up - C.O.I.N.S..
Now.
Money, you stole my rhyme, so why dont you just confess?
Your mouth will say no, but your body will say yes.
Your ears'll say I heard it, your feet: I brung a beer.
The angel'll find you quilty and award me the mayor.
Internal flowing on a mountain thats blasted.
So, cry for your lives and the fight is everlasting.
Freeze, repent ladies and gents and save your spirit.
Cuz once judgment comes, I ain't trying to hear it.
Suckers say, ain't nothing wrong, love is something long.
But nowadays hit the wrong button and your gone.
Its written and caress about people having sex.
If your holes too big, uhh shorty i'll renig.
A fig with milk, the Eifel Tower tilts.
To roast MC's thats why the Coin MC was built.
My grandmom's took a whole year to sew a quilt.
It read, a hard head leaves a soft tale.
So, when you cheat, you get a beating.
I hope it rings a bell, one, two, I know you Power-U.
This is a message to you and you and you.

Timbo King.
What? Yo.
You fake moves like you play chess.
Off with your head, yes, striking at night with a army vest.
Test the mic with words that's scientific.
A chemist in a laboratory building off physics.
I break you down, chopping you up in small pieces.
My flows updated like pants without creases.
Heat releases when energy is conducted.
A forty block radius, the castle is constructed.
My fam's loyal, we stay royal just like Egyptians.
I slam like Islam, my knowledge brings wisdom.
I bomb you with plutanium, mixed with C-4.
Fuck up your route and lane with a detour.
You rap peasants, you dont impress my intelligence.
Off with your head, pawn 4, no type of evidence.
Case closed, legally, we be regally.
Catapults hit direct, destroy the scenery.

Snuggle-Up, , *Killarmy sample in background*.

You know what I mean?, my man Kruger's even here.
All of my other family's here.
You know who I'm talking about... the real cats.
The real kings, the real Gods, y'all dont want it.
U.K., U.K., we're gonna bring that in, y'all.
For the '98 and on, and on, we're gonna bring that in, y'all.
U.K., we rule, we're taking out your kingdom.
What?, for real, everything is ours.
U.K., '98, word is bond.
Peace to the Gods and Earths-Queens.
Peace.
