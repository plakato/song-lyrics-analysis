Free At Last Lyrics

Free at last, free at last, free at last.
Now I'm free at last, free at last.

on no sleep.
Can't breathe, it's so deep, can't breathe, it's so deep.
Nosebleeds are your seats.
Courtside, with a girl with an ass like a horse ride.
And she bad for my heart like a pork rind, heart attack.
Tell that nigga I was poor and I ain't goin' back.
But now I'm richer, all I need's a fuckin' almanac.
Somebody check the time, been gone for a minute.
Somebody check the dick, I've been long for a minute.
Sean Paul for a minute, man gimme the light.
I'm prayin' that these niggas don't see me tonight.
I'm prayin' that a bitch start actin' right.
I make movies, dude, I met Arca.
like.

The carbon era, Arm &amp; Hammer socialite.
Two shots for y'all, too drunk to call.
I sent an email, the text was too long.
I'm waitin' outside, you're takin' too long.
To take you to the club to get your groove on, I hate the club.
I'm sittin' in the booth with the vapor, burn through the paper.
My life is on purpose, you must be mistaken.
I butcher these rappers, just bring home the bacon.
Ah, shit, I hurt myself, lines so fire, man I burnt myself.
Self-immolate like Tibetan super sepen.
Suckin' a dick when I'm finished,.
pause, kittens.
I ain't a player, I just stunt a lot, I ain't old, I just done a lot.
Watchin' these women count calories.
So why they still eatin' my Captain D's?
My architect has to learn Japanese.
Nah, nah, they can't hold me.
The crowd goes mild, lost in the.
world that was gone for a while.
There's a coke in her smile.
Model diet, he is who he says man, I.
don't buy it, I don't buy it.
I don't really know, 'til the fat lady sing so Figaro.
'Til my fans all sayin', oh, you didn't know?
Turnt up on the worst stuff, smoke one with a hurt lung.
I'm at the drive thru with a no IQ nigga sayin'.
Serve somethin', serve somethin'.
