Free At Last Lyrics

Free at last free at last, free at last 
Now, I'm free at last free at last, 
 
on, no sleep, 
Can't, breathe. It'S so deep, can't breathe it's so deep. 
Nosebleeds are your seats 
Courtside with a girl with an ass like a horse ride 
And she bad for my heart, like a pork, rind heart attack 
Tell that nigga I was poor and I ain't goin' back 
But. Now, I'm richer. All I need's a fuckin' almanac 
Somebody check the time been gone for a minute. 
Somebody check the dick I've been long for a minute, 
Sean Paul for a minute man. Gim me the light 
I'm prayin' that these niggas don't see me tonight, 
I'm prayin', that a bitch start actin' right 
I make movies dude. I met Arca
like 

The carbon era Arm
