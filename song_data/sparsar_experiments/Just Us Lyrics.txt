Just Us Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.


What could I say to you?
There's nothing I wouldn't do.
We've traveled so far.
Now it's just us once again.

Pictures appear from the dark.
Of days long ago.
When we made a start.
Like a kiss to a stranger.
Brings a smile to the face.
You're my solitude.
My serenity.
With an angel's face.

I'm hearing the sounds of a cry.
Peaceful he sleeps ?

A silent moved is sealed.
Encapsuled in time.
The days when we were young.
All we had was time.
We'll ride this train.
All the way to the heavens.
Just you and me.
Hand in hand.

A mother's voice calling out slowly.
From the other side patiently.

Slip inside my dream.
Carry me away.
Time goes by.
No matter what you say or do.
I'll still love you.
Time goes by.
I'm with you now.
The days get longer.

Reflections of time.
They're yours and mine.
The things that used to be.
Still remain so fine.
Is the face of a child.
Your common grace?
You're my shining star.
Of the darkest night.
Our saving grace.

I've seen the signs of the times.
Forever is now, there's no rewind.
