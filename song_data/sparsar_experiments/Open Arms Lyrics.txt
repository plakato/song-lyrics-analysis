Open Arms Lyrics
by Virtue.

My child please come home.
I'm waiting for you.
I feel your pain.
I want to comfort you.
I know you.
Think that its.
Too late to come home.
No, I welcome you home.
No, I welcome you home.

You can turn to me.
I'll take you in.
I've been here hoping.
You would choose me.
I'm standing here.
I've never left you.
I'm standing here.
With open arms.
I'm standing here.
With open arms.

Can you move without me.
Can you breath without me.
Oh, can't you see.
How much you need me.
I want to help you.
Can't you feel me near.
Oh, I welcome you Home.
Oh, I welcome you home.

You can turn to me.
I'll take you in.
I've been here hoping.
You would choose me.
I'm standing here.
I've never left you.
I'm standing here.
With open arms.
I'm standing here.
With open arms.
