Beggars And Thieves Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.


Grain of sand, no man's land, I wanna fly.
Fade away, that's okay, I enjoyed the ride.
Incognito, fireflies, burning up my eyes.
Sanctify or receive a fortune full of lies.
Cover me- Disconnected all the way down.
I Gotta hold on.

Beggars and thieves.
They won't bring you no peace.
Beggars and thieves.
They're living on a one way street.
Standing on the edge of madness.
I look down and what do I see.
Beggars and thieves.

Detour ahead-it pretends to save the day.
Full of hope, low on faith, I feel compelled to pray.
Overwhelmed with emotion, the tea has been brewed.
Indiscreet and abandoned, I guess I'm pretty well screwed.
Forgive me, feeble minded out of control.
Break down, shakedown.

Safe cracker, scene stealer, a thief of the first degree.
Heartbreakers with no takers What does it mean?
Dreaming of at time with no pain, Dreaming of the time when they came.
Nothing here but faded pictures, kinda smooth with faded textures.
