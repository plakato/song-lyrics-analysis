\STAY GLDN\ Lyrics
by TwonDon.


Yeah... Hear the potential in my mental, when I'm using this pencil/.
These dreams we follow grew far from hollow just look what we been through/.
Your hometown won't commend you, niggas talk shit to offend you/.
But I'm thorough in every borough yo what chu tryna get into?/.
Grind with the meanest team and the goal is green/.
They gotta respect it - doing in fine in time we living our dreams/.
I'm counting the seconds, tick-tock/.
I see the sand drop, won't give us no shot/.
Either they threatened they see us stepping our way to the top/.
We climbing - and with this rhyming we avoiding them sirens/.
I turned my struggle into a hustle now the rest is with timing/.
I'm being patient/ Uh.
Better say sorry for that late shit/.
Cause niggas is starvin' going through problems dying to escape it/.
You playing on every record, give a fuck what you saying/.
Momma stressin' she need a blessing &amp; I'm tired of praying/.
Do that shit night and dayin'- look to the sky when I'm laying/.

I sit back, and think what life would be if niggas ain't rap/.
I know these bitches will prolly diss us from the shit that we lack/.
They still gon fuck us, no they don't love us - so I don't call em back/.
It's UpperClass until my casket carried on six niggas back/.
&amp; those my scholars, every thought I ponder be bout them dollars/.
We need them commas cause spending with limits ain't my persona/.
You hear me? Laid out the blueprint and I followed it clearly/.
Now these niggas is turning bitches quicker then Tyler Perry/.
Like na uh - do it for momma, Shout out to papa/.
Who kept my pockets with decent profits when having nada/.
I keep it moving, UC the movement now who gon stop us/.
I'm so suburban, til reapers calling I keep it Golden - haha/.
