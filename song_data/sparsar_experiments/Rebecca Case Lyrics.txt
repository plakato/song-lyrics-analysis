Rebecca Case Lyrics
by Rustlah.

There'S no love 
We preach drugs, not hugs 
Cause thugs, don't hug bruuuh, 
Big, shot big chain; big name drop. 
Porter of that 
What up. God lived on the same block, 
Held down the same shops, 
Harder than cane rocks 
Till, your patna put a knife in your back. 
When will the pain, stop 
Chubby raindrops 
Just, a glitch in the kitchen? 
Where innocence went missin, 
The road to santa Rita, 
Wasn't paved in good intentions. 
Only greed, soaked hearts, 
And dishonorable mentions 
So, you wan na be a BOSS, 
Big shot Big chain; Big name drop. 
 days of future past 
When, you speaking through a phone 
Through, a thick pane of glass, 
Your implant, flash GET CASH, 
Get, mad hands, smash glass, 
The man, laughs, 
Puts, you in a cage for 8 summers; 
Replaces your name with some chains, 
And a 7 digit number 
 
Man, with the silver badge 
Gleaming and bright 
Sharpens, his teeth with a knife 
Truly believing he's right, 
Clinking, the keys to your life right in front of your eyes. 
Something inside of you dies 
Righteous with a plasma nerve, blaster 
On the captured. He has ya 
In. His sights like he's your master, 
New age slave trade, 
Where corporations, lobby 
For that unpaid wage 
25 to lifer 
Who can't even decipher 
The loopholes in the laws. 
And you're a fighter. Every time you rattle the cage, 
They hide the light away. You dismantle for days 
Victor, Zsasz, tally, marked arms 
Heart still beating through the bars 
Can't. Remember what your crime was: 
Time's a killer at large 
A Rebecca case 
Lost cause faced with hate 
Searching for love in the dark 
With. All the hunger that awaits 
Big shot big chain, big name drop 
What happened to the love
