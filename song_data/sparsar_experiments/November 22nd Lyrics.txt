November 22nd Lyrics

Julian Camarata, name insert.
I need to break from this prison, help me Wentworth.
Why try when this is the third time my records been burnt.
Since birth, killing tracks has been kids work.
Driving so fast my whip swerved, hit a big curb.
It set ablaze I hope I don't get my dick burnt.
It feels like I'm walking around naked.
And I wish my Nonna was still alive to see that I made it.
Maybe not how y'all think but to me I'm famous.
And she had Alzheimer's so I would need to tape it.
Cause nothing going to stop, nothing going to stop.
Nothing going to stop me from making these other MCs outdated.
Sess puffin', I hold on to my chest clutchin'.
Pen and paper because I don't care when the checks comin'.
I don't expect nothin', but I'm like a suicidal hobbit.
Yeah, a depressed munchkin, that says somethin', don't it?
I wake up freezing but my bed's flooded.
That's why I never sleep, it reminds me too much of death's cousin.
These withdraws don't effect me it's bizarre.
But it's what I get for having big balls and disregarding.
All laws when I break swishers and the codeine dissolves.
But that's what kick start-ed all these problems.
That could fill an endless pits bot-tom.
I need help I can't solve 'me, I want to get par-doned.
But I'm diving to deep and I forgot goggles.
I sought options that included everything but not toxins.
I'm the Shepard that Waka Flocks artist, whom can dodge comets.
And go on a killing spree but leave the block spotless.
I'm adept at this; not novice, I wasn't even there for one day.
Before I got kicked out of God's Garden.
