Because I'm God Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album IHooray, It's a Deathtrip 
Because, I'm God 
I'm gon na ride on the edge of tomorrow 
I'm gon na carry myself on the lonesome breeze 
I'm gon na enter the room of tomorrow, 
I'm gon na tear down the wall. To my total defeat 
Bow before me-, because I'm God 
You don't have to die before me, because I'm God 
I'm gon na live in the eye of the storm yeah 
I'm gon na die, though I never came close to life. 
I'M gon na break yeah whatever's around me, 
I'm gon na give to the rich from the fatherless child 
Bow before me, because I'm God 
All I'm asking do adore me because, I'm God 
Well won't. You come on and dance up- to my evil eye. 
You! Don'T have to die before me because I'm God
