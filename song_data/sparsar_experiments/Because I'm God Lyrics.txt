Because I'm God Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: IHooray! It's a Deathtrip.
Because I'm God.
I'm gonna ride on the edge of tomorrow.
I'm gonna carry myself on the lonesome breeze.
I'm gonna enter the room of tomorrow.
I'm gonna tear down the wall to my total defeat.
Bow before me- because I'm God.
You don't have to die before me - because I'm God.
I'm gonna live in the eye of the storm, yeah.
I'm gonna die though I never came close to life.
I'm gonna break yeah whatever's around me.
I'm gonna give to the rich from the fatherless child.
Bow before me - because I'm God.
All I'm asking do adore me - because I'm God.
Well won't you come on and dance up- to my evil eye.
You don't have to die before me - because I'm God.
