I'll Do The Same Lyrics
by Twi Teacher.

This song is originally Performed in Twi. This is the English Take.

I drink pito and watch Kaizer SÃ¶ze get charged.
Me too, I'm Looking to put status to my name.
I use flows that's killer.
Goes in your head &amp; you forever remember.
Where I'm from, when you see crime.
You saw it?, act like never....
Hustlers &amp; Chicks.
Rolex &amp; Whip's.
Police &amp; Handcuffs.
Gangsters &amp; Clicks.
We hear shit like Pastor's are up to mischief.
Looking for money is a mischief.
Monday to sunday.
Some people carry Ak's.
Pablo Escobar, that's what i'll learn.
This &amp; That, that's what i'll push.
Griselda Blanco &amp; Al Pacino, their lives are my imo.
Finding money is like finding nemo.
When I ask, Jesus is my hero.
Jesus do you know I'm a negro?
If you don't know, black's are also people.
Connection man gives me a visa.
Corruption man is my leader.
Back in Ghana, I'm a teacher.
In babylon, I'm a cleaner.
They think, just because I'm black.
I'm a dealer, but they.
don't know me.
But this &amp; and that about my life.
Just take this little bit of a rhyme and run with it.

SBTRKT.

Cause I've never never had so much to gain and threw it all away.
And if I ever ever had the chance again I'd probably do the same.
Singing oooh I've only let you down.
Singing oooh I've left you the crown.
