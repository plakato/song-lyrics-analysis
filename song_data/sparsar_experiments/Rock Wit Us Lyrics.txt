Rock Wit Us Lyrics
by The Undergods.

Canibus 
The style is new, so we all crowd round into a crew. 
This is what we do. We listen to you. 
Early thirties, spitting words from the lyrical library 
University. That has nothing to do with us personally. 
This is new to you. There'S a reason for that. 
This is beautiful, Canibus and Keith Murray rap 
If. You ever forget the best rap artist, no matter how they were regarded 
Then. You are soon to be forgotten. 
 
Canibus 
Yo increase the cardio, follow the flow 
'Follow, the Leader' ,'I Ain't, No Joke' end quote: 
 
Canibus 
Barack Obama speak ___ to the rasta 
Tell him. I say I'm out to legalize ganja 
Canibus at your service, small electronic purchases, 

Canibus 
Who, you battling you. Ain'T got nobody to blame, 
Just be happy. Your hair color got more black than grey. 
Rap is great. You listen to my songs every day, 
Come to find out. If I'm really not as wack as they say, 
 
Canibus 
Why. Do you rap. I don't have to discuss that 
Temporary layoffs mean good times to bust raps, 
I whistle through my teeth. When I sleep 
The only time I ever feel at peace is when I spit to a beat 
 
Canibus 

The surface degree hotter than some barbecue burger meet 
You. Don'T know me you just heard of me: 
You worshipped me, but then deserted me. Cuss me out with no common courtesy, 
You misinterpret me 
Where on this Earth. Do you think I deserve to be in the middle of the next
emergency 
You wan na learn from me. Then turn to me 
Or turn away and don't even work for me, but I won't search for the beef 
 
Canibus 
Yeah. He fell to his knees in despair and disappeared. 
I signed the wall, Keith, Murray and Canibus was here. 
The names have been changed to protect the privacy of the lyricists 
That spit like this, when they serious
