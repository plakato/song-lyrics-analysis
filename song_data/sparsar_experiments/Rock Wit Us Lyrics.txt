Rock Wit Us Lyrics
by The Undergods.

Canibus.
The style is new, so we all crowd round into a crew.
This is what we do, we listen to you.
Early thirties spitting words from the lyrical library.
University that has nothing to do with us personally.
This is new to you, there's a reason for that.
This is beautiful, Canibus and Keith Murray rap.
If you ever forget the best rap artist, no matter how they were regarded.
Then you are soon to be forgotten.

Canibus.
Yo, increase the cardio, follow the flow.
'Follow the Leader', 'I Ain't No Joke', end quote.

Canibus.
Barack Obama, speak ___ to the rasta.
Tell him I say, I'm out to legalize ganja.
Canibus at your service, small electronic purchases.

Canibus.
Who you battling, you ain't got nobody to blame.
Just be happy your hair color got more black than grey.
Rap is great, you listen to my songs every day.
Come to find out if I'm really not as wack as they say.

Canibus.
Why do you rap? I don't have to discuss that.
Temporary layoffs mean good times to bust raps.
I whistle through my teeth when I sleep.
The only time I ever feel at peace is when I spit to a beat.

Canibus.

The surface degree hotter than some barbecue burger meet.
You don't know me, you just heard of me.
You worshipped me but then deserted me, cuss me out with no common courtesy.
You misinterpret me.
Where on this Earth do you think I deserve to be in the middle of the next.
emergency.
You wanna learn from me then turn to me.
Or turn away and don't even work for me, but I won't search for the beef.

Canibus.
Yeah he fell to his knees in despair and disappeared.
I signed the wall, Keith Murray and Canibus was here.
The names have been changed to protect the privacy of the lyricists.
That spit like this when they serious.
