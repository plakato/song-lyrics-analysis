Supermodel (You Better Work) Lyrics
by RuPaul.

You better work.

Work it, girl.

Do your thing on the runway.

Work.

You better work it, girl.

Wet your lips and make love to the camera.

Work, turn to the left.
Work, now turn to the right.
Work, sashay, shante.

It don't matter what you wear.
They're checking out your savior faire.
And it don't matter what you do.
Cause everything looks good on you, supermodel.

You better work.

Work it, girl.

Do your thing on the runway.

Work.

You better work it, girl.

Wet your lips and make love to the camera.

Work, turn to the left.
Work, now turn to the right.
Work, sashay, shante.

I see your picture everywhere.
A million dollar derriere.
And when you walked in to the room.
You had everybody's eyes on you, supermodel.

Linda, work mama, Naomi, she is fierce.
Christy, foxy lady, out of sight, Cindy, I can feel it.
Claudia, sell the garment, Nikki, work the runway, sweetie.

I have one thing to say, sashay, shante.
Shante, shante, shante.
I have one thing to say, sashay shante.
Shante, shante, shante.
I have one thing to say, you better work, bitch.
