Disparate Youth Lyrics
by 57 Pixels.


All I want is a feature with Tyler C and Earl.
But I'm guessing it'll be easier to have a tie dye shirt wearing squirrel.
To hop on the track. And I don't even think about Eminem.

The blows hes dealing son, I can't take that shit.
Three bars in and I'll break a hip.
It'd hurt less if I take a dip.
In hydrochloric and bath in some laymin jist..
I mean lemon juice. There I go spitting like a retarded kid.
What I forgot my helmet at home so now I'm starting shit?
My flow is hard but I'm soft like carpet is.
So powerful it can push by anything clogging it.
But you hate when I spit, you fucking loathe it.
And I bet its because your girl talks to me with both lips.
Ya don't control shit, no one does in their lives.
We think we do but there's always a pair of eyes.
Watching, jotting down every word, every lie.
Dare deny, you don't have any secrets hidden.
Here's one, I think I'm great when I'm probs the weakest spittin'.

I wanna, I wanna be close to you.
But I need, I need to be told the truth.
For once when you come to me.
Would you please please want to be.
With me for centuries.
For once when you come to me.
I wanna I wanna be close to you.
But I need, I need to be told the truth.
For once when you come to me.
Go back to being Disparate Youth.

So here I am, full fledged and everything.
Why do I stand in a tool shed of wedding plans?
Is it to help a fools dread travel to Neverland?
Or to escape jewels, beds then weathered games.
Yo, its about time people hear me out.
Its annoying floating in a stream filled with doubt.
What is it to me but douche bags with dick crammed mouths.
Saying try rapping bout big tits and a six floor house.
But fuck that suck fags blow smoke, nuts gag.
Buy water guns shoot my daughters sons cut what act?
You're filled of broken dreams like a sluts trash.
Blush pass the blunt ass hole i need to get hiiiiiiiigh.
Oh yeah don't have another child on my block again.
Because I'll shake it til it gets Micheal J Fox-icans.
Pause the shit? I'm watching this. Apartment bills? I'm stocking them.
Up enough to make a mirage exist.
Like the amount of carcasses in my garage that fits.
Uhh about 74 people, lets see you try to do even more evil.
Too much? Yeah I'm feeling a wee more creeper.
Oh well, looks like-.

I wanna, I wanna be close to you.
But I need, I need to be told the truth.
For once when you come to me.
Would you please please want to be.
With me for centuries.
For once when you come to me.
I wanna I wanna be close to you.
But I need, I need to be told the truth.
For once when you come to me.
Go back to being Disparate Youth.
I wanna, I wanna be close to you.
But I need, I need to be told the truth.
For once when you come to me.
Would you please please want to be.
With me for centuries.
For once when you come to me.
I wanna I wanna be close to you....

Real spit, still lit, deal shit, kill bitch-.
Es this, misses, fix this, endless.
Trench that, drenched my, fence gasp, sent as.
Julian, a hooligan, from New Zealand, teach schoolchildren.
How to treat people like dozorubicin. Learn from Buddhism.
Try and find your inner peace.
It'll feel better than a dinner feast.
And you could finally make the liquor cease and jam on to this killer beat.
And you could finally make the liquor cease and jam on to this killer beat.
And you could finally make the liquor cease and jam on to this killer beat.
Don't take it from me I'm not the only one.
People always think they stand so lonely son.
If that was true it'd be pandemonium.
So get up you can't be moping bruh.
