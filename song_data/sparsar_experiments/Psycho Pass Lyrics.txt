Psycho Pass Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


I'm coming through the front, I ain't worried 'bout shit.
Trying to harm me I leave his ass like a tip.
I'mma tell you now, I'mma twist him like a hip.
Then smoke a blunt by my motherfucking self.
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of you here.
Bitch, I only rap just to let you niggas hear.
And when we do a show your fan base disappear.
Bitch, I ain't lying I'mma keep it sincere.
Bitch, since when could you chill up over here?
Bitch, hit the road like a motherfucking deer.
Get hit too, shit bitch might as well.
I don't even talk all a ho do is tell.
I'm standing on a boat finna set the damn sail.
I burn incense because my brain likes the smell.
She get a whiff and thought that it was a spell.
I ain't say come but she at the hotel.
Fuck a nigga mean, me and my niggas don't be fucking with niggas.
We give no fuck 'bout none of you niggas.
Or whoever with you.
I pull up to my nigga then'll spark.
Blunts already rolled what the fuck a nigga thought?
East Memphis streets still burning damn hot.
Police might as well live up on the damn clock.
That's why I stay in the goddamn house.
On the damn couch while I eat take-out.
Text T.A. when the weed run out.
Call T-Bo when we finna swerve out.
I be on the beach feeling like a bird now.
Smoking on a ounce on the roof of the house.
Master Roshi tried to kick a nigga out.
'Cuz I had a sack I ain't tell his ass about.
Bitch you fucking know what the fuck do we about.
Hollow Squad Blunts don't.
never fade out.
