Revolution Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

Comin´ on strong with a new direction.
Take a new life with a total affection.
Mind and soul living on the edge.
See you comin´ on ´cos your life is dead.
I never did go ´cos I never did see.
Now I´m gonna fight ´til the day I go free.
Give it all you got, take a big shot.
Step it up, live it up, fight ´til you drop.
I can feel the power comin´ down on me.
Fight for the Son with a new foundation.
Shout to the world ´cos you never gonna stop.
Come to the rock with a big revolution.
Never look back when you take a big knock.
Back to the wall run with the mob.
Takin´ every tick give a stick to the dog.
Give it all you got, take a big shot.
Step it up, line it up, fight ´til you drop.
I can feel the power comin´ down on me.
I can feel the power comin´ down on me.
