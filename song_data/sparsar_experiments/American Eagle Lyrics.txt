American Eagle Lyrics
by Wordplay.


15 bands - all on American Eagle, 
Blowing money, ain't shit, especially when your ass single 
Last Kings, I'm cashing out. You can call that shit. Regal 
Walked up in the club and my ass ain't, even legal 
Though Word Play was a Latin King from these letters. 
I'M fly as fuck. My closet got all these feathers 
You, keep it silent and they think you, the devil, 
Spent 7 racks on all my jeans and sweaters 
 
Walked up in the store and I'm changing the weather, 
AE Everything I put it on for whatever 
Some 10's of thousands. When you see us together, 
Got an American Eagle plug, I cal that bitch Heather 
These Last Kings jeans are wax nigga, no leather 
Clothes in my closet, rare, like a bald eagle, feather 
I'm balling, like I'm Curry, your ass ball like a tether 
Every time. I walk in the store my budget get bigger, 
I'm fly as fuck. You can see by my shirt, 
Your swag ain't touching mine bruh, your ass is so hurt. 
My shit is mean bruh. My shit go berserk 
Rap game track game bitch. I go to work. 
 
Summertime is mine when I step off the plane, 
I'm dark as fuck, so I don't need no sunscreen 
Put lotion on my tats bruh. My shit is so mean 
LK is my tank and my shorts is AE. 
My love for it deeper than an ocean or a pool 
I get all the fucking fame the money and them garden tools. 
I'M the AE king fuck, your fucking, Tru Religion, jeans, 
Mr., Bookbag, wear that bird and Steez a 501 fein 
It ain't enough amount of money to change where I'm from 
I'll take two-thirds a fucking kilo and put it right in my lungs 
I'm. Moving on I'm moving on fuck that Louie Vutton 
All the drugs I fucking take call me El Padron, 
,
