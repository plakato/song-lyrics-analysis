American Eagle Lyrics
by Wordplay.


15 bands all on American Eagle.
Blowing money ain't shit especially when your ass single.
Last Kings I'm cashing out, you can call that shit regal.
Walked up in the club and my ass ain't even legal.
Though Word Play was a Latin King from these letters.
I'm fly as fuck my closet got all these feathers.
You keep it silent and they think you the devil.
Spent 7 racks on all my jeans and sweaters.

Walked up in the store and I'm changing the weather.
AE Everything I put it on for whatever.
Some 10's of thousands when you see us together.
Got an American Eagle plug I cal that bitch Heather.
These Last Kings jeans are wax, nigga no leather.
Clothes in my closet rare like a bald eagle feather.
I'm balling like I'm Curry your ass ball like a tether.
Every time I walk in the store my budget get bigger.
I'm fly as fuck you can see by my shirt.
Your swag ain't touching mine bruh your ass is so hurt.
My shit is mean bruh my shit go berserk.
Rap game, track game, bitch I go to work.

Summertime is mine when I step off the plane.
I'm dark as fuck so I don't need no sunscreen.
Put lotion on my tats bruh my shit is so mean.
LK is my tank and my shorts is AE.
My love for it deeper than an ocean or a pool.
I get all the fucking fame, the money, and them garden tools.
I'm the AE king, fuck your fucking Tru Religion jeans.
Mr. Bookbag wear that bird and Steez a 501 fein.
It ain't enough amount of money to change where I'm from.
I'll take two-thirds a fucking kilo and put it right in my lungs.
I'm moving on I'm moving on, fuck that Louie Vutton.
All the drugs I fucking take, call me El Padron.
