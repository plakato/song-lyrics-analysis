10 Bands (Drake Reference) Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it man, 
I'm tryna, run through the budget. Man 
OMG niggas sleep, I ain't, trippin', I'mma let'em, sleep 
When, I get it nigga let'em rest in peace. 
 
I can tell ya how it happened. 
I can tell ya'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas. 
I can tell you not a rapper 
You niggas sellin' swag. I ain't got ta open up the package 
Who you with What you claim. 
There'S checks all over me. You know I'm 1317 
Sprite dirty like Diana. Never clean 
My ex asked me Where you movin', I said On to better things: oh 
, 
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it man 
Tryna, run through the budget. Man 
OMG, I ain't trippin', I'mma let'em, sleep 
When, you wake up, nigga rest in peace, 
 
Boys tell stories'bout the man, 
The boy shoots shots from the corner: Robert Horry for'em bands, 
I ain't really wan na, be that type of man 
The world gettin' cold. So I got ta turn the heat up for my fam 
I'm on level. Three, I'm going in ya'll, don't wan na see me get to ten 
Tryin' to wake the beat up for my man, 

Let's get this cheese and go again.
