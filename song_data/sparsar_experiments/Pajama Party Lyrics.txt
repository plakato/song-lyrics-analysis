Pajama Party Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

When you just can't sleep.
And you're sick of counting the sheep.
The sunlight in your head.
Just won't let you put the days to bed.
Pick a place to meet.
In pajamas and bare feet.
On a moonlit street.
Move me to the rhythm of your heartbeat.

Oh, the places we could go.
Chicago, New York, and Toronto.
And if it starts to snow.
We can hop a train to Mexico.
Where we'll sleep on the beach.
With blankets made of leaves from palm trees.
And we'll say Let's never leave.
And that's when I'll feel the sun creeping up on me.

I'll always wake up so confused.
Each time I have that dream of you.
So if you dreamt of me, too.
Does that mean we dreamt the same dream.
