Pimps don't run Lyrics
by Visual.


Hey yo look home boy,ha, Pimps don't run.
It's a real basic thang like one plus one.
Be what you wanna be is what they say when you young.
But they don't ever say lil man don't front.
&amp; those are basic rules, back from the old school.
Look, do what you wanna but always do you.
For example you look dumb if you ACT tough.
Trust me, real type dudes will call that bluff.
Then you get your ass whoop &amp; face lumped up.
&amp; when everybody sees you man, they wondering what.
Happened to you &amp; you be like ....
IT WAS 16 DUDES, THEY WANTED MY CHAIN &amp; BRAND NEW SHOES.
&amp; THEY SPRAYED ME WITH MACE &amp; THEY KNEW KUNG-FU.
LET'S CALL THE HOMIES UP MAN, WHAT WE GONNA DO?
&amp; they look at you like we?? Man, you a damn fool! You be lying too much.
We ain't down for you!!!

Ay,yo Pimps don't run ....
Gangsta ain't guns ....
You betta watch how you walk.
Ay,yo Pimps don't run ....
Gangsta ain't guns ....
You betta watch how talk homie.

Here's another truth, not all g's got guns.
Ya'll know that loud mouth that talks fast ? He's ain't one.
And Naw man, that dude will never be.
Cuz a real type gangstas' way past his pedigree.
He probably says things like.
IMA FUCK THAT BITCH!
IMA PUNCH YO FACE, I'M A THUG, THAT'S IT'S!!!
WE GONNA GET THIS CHEESE,CUZ I FLIP KEYS, I GOT GUNS, I GOT GOONS, IMA.
MAFUCKIN G!!!
Man, straight up its so damn comical.
The way that tough guy shit got phenomenal.
Now don't get me wrong, I ain't saying be a punk.
But if you don't use good judgement, you're done!
Ok,let's say some dude thinks he's the truth.
&amp; he gets called out by some random dude.
They both shoot &amp; both lives they lose.
But hey, at least they kept real.
So what would you do?

Ay,yo Pimps don't run ....
Gangsta ain't guns ....
You betta watch how you walk.
Ay,yo Pimps don't run ....
Gangsta ain't guns ....
You betta watch how talk homie.
