by Yung Kilo.


It's yo boy kilo.
Rip lil snupe.

rest in peace to lil snupe the game needed you it's.
Still gone be a change through the young mini snupe that bitch ass night toni.
Ain't had no reason to take your life I eat sleep pray that I make it.
In the game every night cold ass world we live I keep a chopper in the.
backseat.
Niggas wanna run up on kilo they better bring the fat heat drugs money.
violence always fill the.
Air niggas want illegal money take a life niggas don't care shout to my nigga.
meek.
Never thought a lil nigga from Wilson NC will ever turn out to be me.
Niggas wanna fuck with me think I'm that same lil nigga nothing ain't gone.
punk me down got bazookas.
And them triggers you wanna be that nigga just because you smoke weed nigga.
stay in your lane bitches ain't got shit on me I'm not that nigga now but yeah.
I'm soon to be snupe preached in his songs he gave the game respect this nigga.
right here on the mic every day hoping. He and praying he will get a record.
deal signed in any way I may not be poor but I'm most certainly not rich just.
because a nigga came up from a struggle don't mean I can't take your bitch I.
hate a snitch but all my haters bitches love the dick yeah I'm the next lil.

so if you think that you gone ain't gone make it think about. Snupe and then.
