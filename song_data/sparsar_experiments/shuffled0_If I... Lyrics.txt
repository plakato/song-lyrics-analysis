If I... Lyrics
by Cyrus Da Virus.

Keeping my.
On the road.
Views.
Everybodys.
Mercedes.
Releasing this song.
Are just.
Surving.
To myself.
If I.
If I.
To start.
Get more.
And.
If I.
Both times loose.
Myself.
Become a.
Speaking.
Wait.
I guarantee.
I know my.
Master plan.
Wid all da.
Clothes.
Foot i'n da door.
Magazine reviews.
Ain't Running.
Quick.
Cuz if I.
Try.
Don't even try.
Decide to.
Performers now.
Depends.
Play.
It has to be strong.
So I can.
That I don't.
Only achieve.
Go against.
Make a.
A Freind.
If I.
On YouTube.
It all.
I'm due.

When I'm out.
Choose.
Twice.
Metropolis.
No more.
When I'm.
To Bring.
Only.
Extensive.
Rapping bout.
Try and.
Still be.
Break.
Of a.
Back off.
Da compilation.
Characteristics.
Stepping.
Broken English.
Kicking yourself.
Off.
Miss this.
That I'm making now.
Renting.
That I'm.
Through.
Pretend.
My veins.
If I.
Trying to sell.
To some places.
My name.
Whole.
Yes man.
Air play.
Watered down.
As cold.
Put my.
To witness.
N dubz love.
Try comply.
If I.
If I.
So where.
Before.
On toes.
Jus to.
Make my.
Claim.
Money on.
If I.
That.
Mistake.
And if I.
Stuck.
What to choose.

On da road.
Stick to da.
Then I'll be.
Thoughts.
Will it end.
Is dieing.
Too long.
Could go.
I Wouldn't know.
Should I.
Try and.
Maybe it won't.
Before I.
Gonna know.
Deeper within thins.
And Making reference.
DA pain.
To spend.
Opportunities.
25 thousand.
And pose.
Should.
Considered.
Endure.
This whole.
Killing us slow.
It's hinges.
Wid a album.
When you play it.
Not to.
Half da things.
So manny.
Hydrogen bomb.
You tell.
Even go.

If I can.
Speech you.
Than.
Da game Of life.
Blood.
And conform.
Crying.
Dramatically wrong.
Da grain.

Should I.
Kick it.
And.
Spoken to.
Decided.
Then you'll be.
Getting sum.

At home.

Aswell as.
To sit in.
