Pulling Me Under Lyrics
by XO.

You're the anchor beneath my feet.
You drag me down 'til I can't breathe.
I gasp for air, do I deserve this?
Reach for the light, can't touch the surface.
You keep pulling me under.
You keep pulling me under.
You keep pulling me under.
You keep pulling me under.
You keep pulling me under.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Now every day it feels the same.
Sinking and swimming to your games.
I see no shortcut or loophole around this.
We're in too deep, can't keep myself from drowning.
In you.
In you.
In you.
In you.
You keep pulling me under.
You keep pulling me under.
You keep pulling me under.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
You keep pulling me under.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
You keep pulling me under.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
Keep pulling me – keep, keep pulling me.
