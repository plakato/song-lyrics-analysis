Do U Feel Pain Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Huh yeah, Mr. Pain nigga.
He don't feel me ain't real, so he don't exist.
Poof be gone,.

Now when you cut does it bleed, and when it hurts you feeling me.

Black on black crime in the ghetto, mama lost another son.

Prisons got another baby, whole life done been shady.

If you don't feel it then you numb, nigga we know pain where I'm from nigga.

Yung Ro.
How long can I take this, put up with fake shit.
Keeping it basic, don't think I'ma make it.
It's hard to face it, got everyone waiting.
Went from Carrio hero, called it anticipating.
But sometimes, I wanna cut my mic off.
Sometimes I wanna go to my room, and cut the lights off.
And meditate to find peace, and try to remember my purpose.
But this pain is on my brain, I can't pretend it ain't hurting.
So I got use to it, and made pain my friend.
Shit I figured get cool with him, hey he coming again.
You never seen a spiritual, lyrical miracle worker.
And this material hearing, is my superior working.
Through me, and I try to keep it all positive.
But if you only understood, just how hard it is.
Well what's worse is this chip on my shoulder, just keep getting bigger.
Tired of watching that same picture, vision ain't getting clearer.
Plus I can't even find a remote, to change the channel.
Call me Nobody the Unknown hid, all deranged from scanners.
Like David Banner might get ya, broke stole shot up.
Hey-ho, no I bet ya your ass think about us.
They lock up us, in the Penitentiaries.
Them do's revolving, been going on for centuries.
I feel the flames of the game, and the pain that it brings.
I'm still a mayn but I remain, out my frame when it rains.
Cause I'm a nobody nigga, yeah I know you feel me coming man.
Walking not running man, creeping with my gun in hand.
A funny man,  and never hollered back.
But that's the end of that story, don't believe me then holla back.
