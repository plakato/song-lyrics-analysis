Mannequin Lyrics
by Yuna.


Who are you? What you want from me?
I've got nothing to give.
Are you here to waste time with me?
Cause time is all I have.

I don't know what it means to feel whole.
You're next to me, but I feel so cold with you.
I will be your mannequin, love.
Moving my lips the way that you want.
Remain the same whenever you walk away.

I will be your mannequin, love love love.
I will be your mannequin, love love.
I will be your mannequin, love love.
I will be your mannequin, love love love.

I am the deepest shade of jaded.
Drowning from the past, love.
Can you breathe, breathe love into me?
So I'll know what it's like.

I don't know what it means to feel whole.
You're next to me, but I feel so cold with you.
I will be your mannequin, love.
Moving my lips the way that you want.
Remain the same whenever you walk away.

I will be your mannequin, love love love.
I will be your mannequin, love love.
I will be your mannequin, love love.
I will be your mannequin, love love love.

Love, love, I will be your mannequin, love love.
I will be your mannequin, love love.
I will be your mannequin, love love.
