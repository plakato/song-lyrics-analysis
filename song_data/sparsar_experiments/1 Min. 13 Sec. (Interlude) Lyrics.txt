1 Min. 13 Sec. (Interlude) Lyrics
by Z-Mane.


A nigga get paid, then it's all about the money. 
Then everybody want a piece of it. Man, that's funny 
Send, a nigga running like a lil, kid's, nose, 
If, your girl's, fine, yellow and thick. She might get chose 
J's on my toes or should I say my feet: 
Money in my pocket try and take it. Then you sleep, 
They, worried about the fame and the fortune. 
These niggas get it late man I get it in the morning. 
Southern Oklahoma, born and raised country boy to the grave 
I'm a have the mic burning. Nigga can't you feel the flame 
Now turn the A.C. up or burn up with the heater 
I'm all about my bread, take it white or wheater 
Your girlfriend. I see her. I really wan na meet her 
Bring. Her to my crib have her going fast. Like a cheetah, 
Twitter heads following, I guess I am the leader 
Niggas dying just to reach my level man catch a breather, 
Haha, asthma attacking ya 
When. I finish man I'll bring her right back to ya 
Man, I'm a D-Town native yeah shout out to Davis. 
I only want a yes girl, no time for maybes 
Man. This is only 21 bars 
When. I was young. I wanted about 21 cars. 
Man. Is this a song or maybe an interlude 
Don't matter, either way because it's concluded
