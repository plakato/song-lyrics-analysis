Bright Eyes Lyrics
by Vonnegutt.

I think I've seen you before, no wait that was just in my dreams.

I took it upon myself to go and intervene.
Between the scratches and the pulled hair.

And not to mention that you're pretty cute.
Been down this road before, and I've been back again.
Next thing you know she's throwin' all her clothes up out the sunroof.

I think I'm in love.
I think I'm in love.

I think I'm in love.
At the hotel, it was all from there.
And come to think about it, i didn't even catch her name.
All this time before and now I've lost my track again.
She had the brightest eyes I'd ever seen.
See people busy playin' games and making truth a dare.
She was all about herself, at least that's what it seemed.
She handcuffed to the bed with chains.
What it takes to get you here is what i'm askin' then.
I must admit that we make quite the pair.

She took out whips and all them freaky things.

Of course she left before morning came.
I took that as my cue and then i went and made my moves.
She laughed and said I bet you think you're really smooth.
What i should ignore has kept me back from when.
