Power Lyrics
by YUNG ROC.


I know una dey feel my beat right now 
Wetin, I wan yarn different right now, 
Look at my life on different angle, 
The courses. Events are on a chain reaction, yo 
No matter. What men must whack 
If? I work so hard. I swear. I no go lack. 
This life na real jungle 
Even, if it rains the rule, is we must struggle yo 
No, be by might nor by power 
No be grii, grii, no be gra gra 
Look, for what you seek in time, 
Pray hard you go, get what you desire! 
Your life is full of ups and downs 
Er'day. We see peeps smile and frown 
Work your way straight. Uptown 
No do merry-go-round and I'm out now 
 
Say. I dey fresh, like this 
I dey fine like this 
Omo. You know the story now: 
See them wey been laugh me 
Them wey been mock me 
Happy to know me now: 
Omo our blessings, no go Sour sour, sour, sour leh 
Omo na the Oluwa power power power power, leh 
 
One day, gala hawker fit push, Rolls Royce. 
Even pure water trader no fit shout above him. Voice 
 life grows in stages. 
Life is not ugly e get different phases. 
I know the dues I owe 
I know the rules I made 
I know the milestones. 
I know choices I made 
I'll, be moving on the right side, 
Not, the wild side, 
Keeping my eyes, open, focusing the right side, 
As Oluwa dey by my right side. 
Nothing, I go lack if I work for it 
Now. I don dey see myself on the bright side. 
I got ta, thank God cuz his hands on it. 
 
Say I dey fresh, like this

Omo. You know the story now: 
See them wey been laugh me 
Them wey been mock me 
Happy to know me now:

Be what I wan Na be 
If, I work hard on it, 
I'll be where I wan na be 
Yo. No be my fault. I dey see the sunshine 
Insha Oluwa. What'S mine is all mine. 
I'M on the apex. I dey see things clear, 
My future so bright and it's crystal clear. 
And my fame is near 
Na me dem dey, cheer 
Nowadays. The rules I made an him dem dey adhere 
Cuz. Even jealousy cannot ignite the fire. That'S part of me. 
I walked a million miles to get where I stand in history. 
God blessed me, nobody can take it. 
Even, though you go to babalawo. Nobody can curse me 
Yes. Of course I no dey lie 
If y'all. Doubt me Make you. Try me 
Call me on your mirror. Its not gon, find me 
See olurun, you dey my side 
And. I know say you be my guide 
Never ever I know no fear
