Power Lyrics
by YUNG ROC.


I know una dey feel my beat right now.
Wetin I wan yarn different right now.
Look at my life on different angle.
The courses, events are on a chain reaction yo!
No matter what, men must whack.
If I work so hard I swear I no go lack.
This life na real jungle.
Even if it rains the rule is we must struggle yo!
No be by might nor by power.
No be grii grii no be gra gra.
Look for what you seek in time.
Pray hard, you go get what you desire.
Your life is full of ups and downs.
Er'day we see peeps smile and frown.
Work your way straight uptown.
No do merry-go-round and I'm out now!

Say I dey fresh like this.
I dey fine like this.
Omo you know the story now.
See them, wey been laugh me.
Them wey been mock me.
Happy to know me now.
Omo our blessings no go Sour sour sour sour leh!
Omo na the Oluwa power power power power leh!

One day, gala hawker fit push Rolls Royce.
Even pure water trader no fit shout above him voice.
life grows in stages.
Life is not ugly e get different phases.
I know the dues I owe.
I know the rules I made.
I know the milestones.
I know choices I made.
I'll be moving on the right side.
Not the wild side.
Keeping my eyes open focusing the right side.
As Oluwa dey by my right side.
Nothing I go lack if I work for it.
Now I don dey see myself on the bright side.
I gotta thank God cuz his hands on it.

Say I dey fresh like this.
I dey fine like this.
Omo you know the story now.
See them, wey been laugh me.
Them wey been mock me.
Happy to know me now.
Omo our blessings no go Sour sour sour sour leh!
Omo na the Oluwa power power power power leh!

I know I can.
Be what I wanna be.
If I work hard on it.
I'll be where I wanna be.
Yo! No be my fault I dey see the sunshine.
Insha Oluwa what's mine is all mine.
I'm on the apex I dey see things clear.
My future so bright and it's crystal clear.
And my fame is near.
Na me dem dey cheer.
Nowadays the rules I made an him dem dey adhere.
Cuz even jealousy cannot ignite the fire that's part of me.
I walked a million miles to get where I stand in history.
God blessed me, nobody can take it.
Even though you go to babalawo, nobody can curse me.
Yes of course I no dey lie.
If y'all doubt me, Make you try me.
Call me on your mirror, its not gon find me.
See olurun you dey my side.
And I know say you be my guide.
Never ever I know no fear.
Yeah I'm taking over this year!
