23 - Stop Xenophobia Promo Lyrics
by PureMatics.


No to xenophobia
Phobia
No to xenophobia
Phobia

No to xenophobia
Phobia
No to xenophobia
Phobia

Stop the xenophobia
Why ungibulala
Ngibulalelani 

Xenophobia is an irrational. Emotional
Chemical inbalance
Xenophobia has no natural place

Stop. The xenophobic culture
Xenophobia is a vulture
Cultured cultures in UK currently
Live in harmony

The Irish hate, the Scots
And, the British hate everyone
Including Yanks and the French

But you never hear of such blood stains
In the streets
Why so much barbaric, 
Barbarian
Barbarism

Mungano wa, Africa

Why, ungibiza, ngama, gama
Ungibiza, ikwerekwere
Inyamazana, hey wena, chileshi

Zimbabwe, helped ANC
Lama qhawe Enu
During umzabalazo

When Zimbabwe was the bread basket
Of Africa
Now. You kill us for fun

What happened to the rainbow nation 
And. All the hard work and votes
Kalangas put into Mzansi 

We worked those mines
Way before the Dutch fences

Phansi ngodlame
Stop Xenophobia, today
And, not tomorrow, sikhotheni
Utholeni ngokubulala
Umvuzo, wakho, yimi 

Open letter to President Zuma
Kodwa. Why do you turn a blind eye? 
Thina sikuhlonipha kangaka

No to xenophobia
Phobia
No, to xenophobia

No, to xenophobia
Phobia
No, to xenophobia

Back to the matter at hand
I, hope, ngokucula
Ngesintu, lizongizwa, ngchono
Umama li Ndebele
Ugogo, ngumaNkomo

Bantu language, speakers
Please, listen, carefully
And, focus
Keik na may, moi
Asebliff

When you beat and stab us
We bleed red. Just like you
Dont. We 

When verbally abuse, us
We dont carry arms. Do we 
When abohata
Stop us systematically
To, extort bribes from us

We dont fight back? Do we 
So why so much hate bantu
Police radiated xenophobia

Xenophobia is cancer
Trapped in time
Like a capsule
No baby is born with hate

Babies and grown folk
Are then taught to hate
Why 

No to xenophobia
Phobia
No, to xenophobia
Phobia

No to xenophobia
Phobia
No to xenophobia
Phobia

Xenophobia is another form of racism
Xenophobia is another form of racism
Xenophobia? Is another form of racism
Xenophobia is another form of racism

No to xenophobia
Phobia
No, to xenophobia
Phobia

No, to xenophobia
Phobia
No to xenophobia
Phobia

Why, kill a man whose off to work
Cos you say he takes your jobs
Politicians. High profile. Artist
And common folk
Say nowt
Cos you wan na remain neutral
There is no neutral ground with xenophobia, people

Your passive behaviour
Does, nowt to change things

Hopefully. We can begin a new era
In which xenophobia will be ejected
As. A vote, winner
