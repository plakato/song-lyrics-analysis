Dirty Dreams Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Powdered pride in a jar near your bed.
Save it up, save it up.
For the death of loneliness.
Caution tape around the scars.
That still bleed for me.
For me.

Who knows?

Tones the shape of surprise.
Every voice is paralyzed.
Animals don't beg like you do, like you do, like you do?

Tones the shape of surprise.
Every voice is paralyzed.
Animals don't beg like you do, like you do, like you do?

Incidental love is all around.

Tones the shape of surprise.
Every voice is paralyzed.
Animals don't beg like you do, like you do, like you do?

Who knows?

Who really knows about.
23, you and me, 33, dirty dreams?
Every night.

Who really knows about.
23, you and me, 33, dirty dreams?
Every night.
