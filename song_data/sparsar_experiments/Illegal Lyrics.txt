Illegal Lyrics
by 67.

Mischief 
 
Dem man just chat like bitches 
Everyday. I run to the riches dodging plain clothes and snitches 
More time, man a suspect, never been a victim or witness 
Skrr round. Your block on smoke can't talk about the things I've
witnessed 
 
Dimzy 
 In skengs. We trust. That'S me and my people 
They're saying the shit that I rap about is way too illegal. 
Bro said he got, phones get grub, he got spots like measles, 
, Pull up, skrr bang. That'S me and my people 
 
Mischief 
I, leave bare man. Angry they broke 
I. Make P from the moment I woke still make drinks from coke. .
 Add that bosh to the raw I just redone a whole load. 
Still tryna see riches them man tryna, please hoes, 
That's, why my trap phone blows 
It's all truth! No word of a lie: 
2 dottys up on a big bike, really tryna hit up a guy 
 Them man there. So wrong got left cah. They won't move right. 
15. On my waist, I ain't tryna. Have me a fight, 
Splish splash, and I'm doing it right. 
 Stay dodging those feds 
Tryna turn grams into money, tryna turn money to skengs, 
Take risk and I build man still I run through them, Z's 
, On the back roads. Ten toes ten toes got my stack all mense, 
Make money. I don't make new friends: 
 Ring trap. 24'S. I push so much work on the block. 
Nobody helped me out had to got get what I got. 
Like forget a middle man. I wan na talk gwuap with a boss, 
 365 through the year and his phone still ain't switched off. 
 
Mischief 
Dem man just chat like bitches 
Everyday. I run to the riches dodging plain clothes and snitches 
More time, man a suspect, never been a victim or witness 
Skrr round your block on smoke can't talk about the things I've witnessed, 
 
Dimzy 
 In skengs. We trust. That'S me and my people 
They're saying the shit that I rap about is way too illegal. 
Bro said he got, phones get grub, he got spots like measles, 
, Pull up, skrr bang, that's me and my people 
 
Dimzy, 
 Pull up skrr bang. That'S me and my people 
We slide through jump out with skengs ten toes ting, like it's legal, 
, Bro whip out the skeng watch. It kick pow like Lethal 
I pray to Allah, but I do some thing's that are evil 
Like, bring out the dots or put the 44 spins in the vehicle. 
Tryna put opps in a box like cereal 
Put holes in your Armani Emporio, 
Hold corn. If your tryna be a hero, go from a hundred to zero 
Money, don't sleep and the clock? Don'T stop 
And the fiends, don't sleep! So the phones? Don'T stop 
If, it's beef! Then it's beef, your block and my block 
Ten toes in the streets or in a 4 door truck 
You, don't know about skengs in 4 door, trucks, 
1, Mac, broke, backs and stuff 
Mana got things and stuff 
Back up the things and stuff 
Cutting through the city. In cabs, I don't pay no weight in fares when I'm tryna buy lunch. 
They say I smoke too much. Skunk 
44 leave a big man, slumped 
, 
Mischief 
Dem man just chat like bitches 
Everyday. I run to the riches dodging plain clothes and snitches 
More time, man a suspect, never been a victim or witness 
Skrr round your block on smoke can't talk about the things I've witnessed, 
 
Dimzy 
 In skengs. We trust. That'S me and my people 
They're saying the shit that I rap about is way too illegal. 
Bro said he got, phones get grub, he got spots like measles, 
, Pull up, skrr bang. That'S me and my people
