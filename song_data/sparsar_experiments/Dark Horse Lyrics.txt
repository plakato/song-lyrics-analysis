Dark Horse Lyrics
by 57 Pixels.


Hold up, is that my name you're calling?
Stuck in class with no money, no wallet.
With two friends why am I even in college?
My grades have been doing nothing but falling.
Rap is the only thing I'm good at.
But I still suck at that should of been a hood rat.
But I bet I'll do worse at that so I move back.
If I keep bending my back for everyone I could snap.
Fuck this, I wish I could go back. A whole 180 like a new cap.

Before I went camping and puked in that forest.
Even before I thought women were gorgeous. I feel like a tourist.
Everything I see is new to me, its weird cause usually.

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for.
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse.
Are you ready for?
Ready for?
A perfect storm?
Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine.
Once you're mine.
There's no going back.

I've never met anyone quite like her.
In the bedroom she prefers all nighters.
I don't wanna get to close it might hurt.
Like sticking it in from behind like I sniped her.
Christ your, so incredible.
So exceptional you need a pedestal.
Her timing was just impeccable.
The next place she wants to fuck is a confessional.
I guess that's cool, Yeah I guess that's cool.
Whatever let's me make a mess of you.
A fresh ass dude, I'm a fresh ass dude.
And she still thinks she'll be my next tattoo.
Is this your best debut?
I've seen better from one legged stripers near The Island boo.
Don't stress this, you.
Will blow up louder and better than that Wildin' dude.
Haha, That's a stab at Nick.
All I want to do Mirah is grab that tit, and after it.
We'll find a nice place to jump into a cab and dip.

Uh, she's a beast.
I call her Karma.
She eat your heart out.
Like Jeffrey Dahmer.
Be careful.
Try not to lead her on.
Shawty's heart is on steroids.
Cause her love is so strong.
You may fall in love.
When you meet her.
If you get the chance you better keep her.
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart.
She turn cold as a freezer.
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor.
She can be my Sleeping Beauty.
I'm gon' put her in a coma.
Damn, I think I love her.
Shawty so bad.
I'm sprung and I don't care.
She ride me like a roller coaster.
Turn the bedroom into a fair.
Her love is like a drug.
I was tryna hit it and quit it.
But lil mama so dope.
I messed around and got addicted.
