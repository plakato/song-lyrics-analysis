Los silent kidz Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Driving through the lot finding different cars to drive out moving snow like.
bricks falling off my hands birds singing music to my ears The come up coming.
through we hide the Glocks around stick up kidz coming through when u talking.
to much we quick when its danger around thoughts to silent to touch eyes to.
closed to see knock your self out words can't touch me to soild to be seened.
around here give em the full clip same o clip bullets passing at fast speeds u.
can't escape it because we see through.
