Lurid Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


There's a knife up in my spine got a razor in my pocket.
Counting fifties in my grave, pimp mctombstone what they call me.
Now i'm laying in the rain smoking weed up and i'm spraying.
Thirty shots to any bitches tryna claim that they can bang.

BANG.
BANG.
BANG.

Take a shot and then you praying.
Mangled corpse up in the mud, decomposing into grains.
The legendary outcome of my journey to the fame.
Seek out riches and new visions venture farther then these lames.

Fuck niggas hate.
Real ones just grind to get the cake.
I am the one they try to chase.
But this shit never was a race.
I take my time and get it straight.
I smack a pussy in the face.
Don't share a crumb from off my plate.
I never slither with a snake.

Cause you all fake I don't got time for a fool.
Running round scheming all day you fucking mook.
Get your self a pack smoke a little then you flip the rest.
Get a trap line then tell them chill with the text.
Hotboys I don't like though be EASY.
Don't think what you see is real on the T.V.
Yes the police will run up in your residence.
If you off point then you caught with the evidence.
I be 10 steps up ahead where the felons is.
Never will snitch cause that be the sucker shit.
Still smoking building empires with my fucking bitch.
Run up on me you will die so bloody quick.
