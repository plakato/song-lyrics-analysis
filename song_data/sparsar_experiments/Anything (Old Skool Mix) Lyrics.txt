SWV.
Anticipation, of what's to come.
I'm so happy that, I'm the lucky one.
So long I've waited but it's, never too late.
For love…
It feels so right, baby, that it can't be wrong.
Where I am weak, baby, you make me strong.
I'm down for you, and whatever you want.
To do… it's all up to you, because.

Anything you want, baby Gonna try to.
I am gonna try to do It's alright.
I'm gonna try, to do.
Pleasure every way You can ride.
Just to get with you If you want to.
To…
SWV.
Whatever method used, is alright with me.
As long as you get to where, you need to be.
This is the vision made for both of our eyes.
To see…
It feels so right, it can't be wrong.
Where I am weak, ba-by, you make me strong.
I'm down for you, and whatever you want me.
To do… it's all up to you, because.

Ol Dirty Bastard.
Dirty Bas, style cuts like glass.
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass.
Yo Gods, another like platinum hit.
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit!
Method Man.
Kaboom! Guess who stepped in the room.
Tical, hailing from the Shaolin Isle.
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C.
With the S-S-double-double-U  to the V-V.
Me me goin downtown, let me see.
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now.
Listen, I ain't sweatin no competition.
Flow, goin mad low like I'm dissin.
U-God.
Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group.
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep.
Nonstop, put you on the choppin block.
Unorthodox, attitude to melting pot.
Method Man.
I'll do anything, I'm so into you.
Right here, I win, downtown with the Wu.
Kaboom! Guess who stepped in the room.
The S-S-double-double-U  to the V-V.
