Pray For Me Lyrics
by QuayChronicles.


Pray for me, young man with big plans.
Billions envisioned but start with less than 10 grand.
What to do? Moms needs me.
My state need me, Hip-Hop starvin', sayin' feed me.
Enter my complex, my stress.
Not concave... nah--- more like it's convex.
Sorry, let me explain it at its simplest.
This is my heart... nah--- this is my art.
My only chance, to do my part.
Lyrics learn to sew and knit with the hope of.
Gettin' words to stitch and, reupholster my culture.
Save more than myself: takin' it further.
And I can't comeback until we all got 40 acres.
And the mule's a Cadillac.
God Bless the day for me.
And let the people pray for me.

Look! Anyone can get on mic and rhyme.
But how many will be remembered in due time.
Mine! Understand that where I rhyme and where I'm in.
Everything I'm not makes me everything I am.

To help another person just get through.
A life they ain't ask for but forced to just use.
Figure my words as your just dues.
So excuse, if the raps aren't in metaphors.
I'd rather speak it plain so more people can feel me more.
Recognize: I don't want to rap to you.
I'd rather speak it plain so that I can rap through you.
All in hopes that my word connects.
Explains my complex about bein' too complex.
Cause, lyrically I could be Talib Kweli.
But at the end of the day, who would pray for me?
