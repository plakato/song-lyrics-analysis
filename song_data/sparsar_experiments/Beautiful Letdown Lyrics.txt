Beautiful Letdown Lyrics
by Switchfoot.

It was a beautiful letdown.
When I crashed and burned.
When I found myself alone, unknown and hurt.

It was a beautiful letdown.
The day I knew.
That all the riches the world had to offer me.
Would never do.

In a world full of bitter pain.
And bitter doubt.
I was trying so hard to fit in.
Until I found out.

I don't belong here.
I don't belong here.
I will carry a cross and a song.
Where I don't belong.

It was a beautiful letdown.
That's what I'll forever be.
And though it may cost me my soul.
I'll sing for free.

We're still chasing our tails.
And the rising sun.
And our dark water planet.
Still spins in a race.
Where no one wins.
And no one's one.

I don't belong here.
I don't belong here.
I'm gonna set sight.
And set sail for the kingdom come.
Your kingdom.
Won't you let me down!
Let my foolish pride forever let me down.

What a beautiful letdown.
Painfully uncool.
The church of the dropouts, the losers.
The sinners, the failures, the fools.
What a beautiful letdown.
Are we salt in the wound?
Let us sing one true tune.
