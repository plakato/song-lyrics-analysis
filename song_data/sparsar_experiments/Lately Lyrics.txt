Lately Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


You know me OG, nigga, 
Moving, ozs and running from the police. Nigga 
Feel, like I ain't, had no sleep for about 4 years now, 
I been out here in these streets. I cry no tears now. 
I ain't know â€˜til. Now, while I was out here doing, these shows 
I was out here fucking these hoes and it was right there under my nose 
When. I needed me, someone never thought that she was the one 
Thinking about jumping the broom hope. I ain't jumping the gun, !
 No pun intended 
No other bitches, your love's exquisite 
, I'm so committed 
I'm gon', admit it. I hope you're with it 
 6 feet above 
It was all sex beats and drugs. 
 
Now I'm here to receive your love. 
Never thought I needed love 
 
But. Lately, 
Every time I think about it, I go crazy. 
Just can't do without it you're. My baby 
Never thought that I would shout it 
But. I need love and that's your love, your love, 
 
Baby. I just want to celebrate 
In the middle of nowhere. Like the letter H 
And, I can't wait to cut the wedding cake, 
It's crazy, how you hold me down and make me levitate 
Girl you my first second third, fourth and fifth choice: 
This love deeper than Michael from Boyz II, Men's voice; 
And, it don't feel forced Far from bogus 
Gorgeous, our love will part the sea like Moses 
Trojans. I swear you got that hocus pocus 
That repossessed, my ford girl, I'm losing my focus 
Hypnosis. You got me at your door with roses: 
And a ring with a bunch of snowman noses. 
Lotus flower bomb remind me of a song 
Bonita Applebum, I'm glad you put me on 
 
Sometimes. I may complain 
That. I can't take the pain. 
I just can't stand the rain 
Sometimes. My heart gets weary 
But, I'm blessed to say 
That that was yesterday 
 
Fuck them bops ain't chasing nothing but guap 
I put your love on top, and now I just can't stop- 
 
And girl. You know that I just hate sleeping alone: 
My bed is a straight cannibal. I feel like a caged animal 
And. I just can't handle
