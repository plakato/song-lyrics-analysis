Lately Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.

Lately I've been getting focus.
Going to class fast to avoid the clowns who really just wanna be the.
jokesters.
Last quarter.
I was the one.
Getting bad grades then lying to mom.
When my report card come.
One day she sat me down &amp; said son.
Your really bright.
No need to fuss and fight.
Cause you know what's right.
So I'm working every night.
To accomplish a dream.
With my team.
You know.
I'mma get it by any means.
Nothing , Without.
Motivation.
Haters say we hate them.
But fuck it we still working.
And never hating.
On another person.
Who spend their nights working, and planning.
Like us.
So why fuss.
With another nigga.
Who not in the picture.
They been cropped out.
How can you school me if you drop out?
Dirty flows get moped out.
When we cleaning.
Spitting this dope shit.
That hiphop feigning.
When I'm on the mic.
Don't bike.
Cause you can't kick it where I stand.
Your bellow me.
Under me is where you stand.
I'm not a baby.
So please don't hold my hand.
I quickly drown you dry rappers and call it quick sand.
Nigga.
Money can buy books but it can't buy intelligence!
Nigga.
I quickly drown you dry rappers and call it quick sand.
