Billy the Kid Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Silence 
In the steps of no-man's land, 
Camp fire, the smell of prarie wind 
Men, surround the blaze 
Drink booze recall the day. 
Til a strangers voice rings out to pray. The sin 
 
The man who pulls his gun'd, be dead 
Before. He moves the trigger 
Scared to death. No one dared to breathe. 
Billy took their money 
Burst into ringing laughter, 
Stole a horse and left the shattered scene. 
 
Billy the kid beast of prey that won't be tamed. 
Billy, the kid loved the thrill of deadly games, 
 
Wanted 
For, the men he'd killed in vain 
A thousand dollars cash on Billy's, head 
Hunted by a star 
For the lives he'd left in pain 
And the day they met the outlaw lost the game. 
 
The marshal held his gun 
Aimed at Billy's head with laughter 
But. The youngster was to proud for given' in 
Billy, felt no pain 
But he was shot. The law was faster 
Falling to his knees. He hit the trail 
 
Billy, the kid beast of prey that won't be tamed. 
Billy, the kid loved the thrill of deadly games, 
Billy the kid a youngster and his deadly gun, 
Billy the kid a lonely hero on the run, 
, 
The, killing and the blood for golden dreams. 
A senseless war, 
An endless fight the youngster couldn't win 
A hundred times before he'd died, 
He knocked on heaven's door. 
Til his maker opened up to lead him in 
 
Billy the kid beast of prey that won't be tamed. 
Billy, the kid loved the thrill of deadly games, 
Billy the kid a youngster and his deadly gun, 
Billy the kid on the run
