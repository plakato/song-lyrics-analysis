Analogue Lyrics
by A-ha.

Come back, my darling one.
I'm calling on you.
The road ahead is long.
And I must warn you.
I wonder where did she go?
If I failed you.
I tell you right now.
All I want you to know, I love you.
All I need is the time to show you.
Come back, my fallen son.
Don't let them fool you.
Cause when the day is done.
They'll never move you.
Lay down your senseless pride.

Put out your mournful tones.
I tell you right now.
All I want you to know, I love you.
All I need is the time to show you how I feel.
Feel.
Lay down your senseless pride.
You traveled once too often, yeah.
I tell you right now.
All I want you to know, I love you.
All I need is the time to show you, oh yeah.
You know, I love you.
All I need is the time to show you how I feel.
