I'm Really Just A Loser Lyrics
by Twitchy.


I'm really just a loser.
Geek or whatever.
But imma be me conscience clean for forever.
I'm a loser, said that I'm a loser.

You can tell that I'm a loser.
By the time you shake my hand.
Politely tell you now that you will never understand.
Who I am, I'm a faggot with a plan.
To make the world my other land.
I want to have about a million things.
All the money in the world.
Plus I wish that I could sing.
But nothing comes easy it all gets harder.
And dealing with it wrong it could also get darker.
Accept who you are let yourself shine brightly.
And we all have flaws and somewhere unlikely.
Dealing with crap I don't cut or take pills.
Imagine suicide lives write a couple of wills.
Would I be hurting all the people surrounding me in my life.
Or would they even care to bother have a reason to fight.
Because I've met rock bottom but will you help me now.
Or not give a shit and stay letting me down.

And do I matter in life or do I matter at all.
And am I dying in peace or getting chopped with a saw.
And will my spirit be remembered when it's strapped in my casket.
Had only one life and I'm glad that it lasted.
Was a mother fucking idiot.
Searching for help.
I got friends on my mind I don't care about myself.
And my mind stays fucked up it works for me.
My clever little brains always hurting me.
They never call me cool but I could pretend though.
We could all get along and play Super Nintendo.
I could order Dominoes and we could all relax.
Talk about the world like when will it collapse.
Not think about the negatives I think about it twice.
People love you more if you view about it nice.
Opinions ain't shit if they are not super.
In the ending of it all.
I am really just a loser.
I am really just a loser.
