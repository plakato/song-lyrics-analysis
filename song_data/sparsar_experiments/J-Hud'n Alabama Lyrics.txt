J-Hud'n Alabama Lyrics
by The Unknown DJ.

I'M your niiiga, I'm your triiggaa 
Don't ask for money, be wild'n, funny 
Yo yo…no job. Just give me a blоwjоb 
Just, be my honey white slave for money. 
 
I'm, your Black mamma, my name's Obama, 
I came Pakistana for Jihad'n Alabama 
Be. My sister, be my Minister. 
Yo yo yo..Jihad'n Alabama
