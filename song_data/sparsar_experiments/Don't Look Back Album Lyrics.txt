Don't Look Back Album Lyrics
by Boston.


Don't look back, ooh a new day is breakin'.
It's been too long since I felt this way.
I don't mind ooh where I get taken.
The road is callin', today is the day.
I can see, it took so long just to realize.
I'm much too strong not to compromise.
Now I see what I am is holding me down.
I'll turn it around, oh yes I will.
I finally see the dawn arrivin'.
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'.
It's a bright horizon and I'm awakin' now.
Oh I see myself in a brand new way.
The sun is shinin' ooh the clouds are breakin'.
Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play.
I can tell there's no more time left to criticize.
I've seen what I could not recognize.
Everything in my life was leading me on.
But I can be strong, oh yes I can.
I finally see the dawn arrivin'.
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'.
Far away and left behind, left behind.
Oh the sun is shinin'.
And I'm on my road.
Don't look back, ooh a new day is breakin'.
It's been so long since I felt this way.
I don't mind ooh where I get taken.
The road is callin', today is the day.
I can see, it took so long just to realize.
I'm much too strong not to compromise.
Now I see what I am is holding me down.
I'll turn it around, oh yes I will.
I finally see the dawn arriving.
I see beyond the road I'm driving.
Far away and left behind.
Don't look back.
Don't look back.
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

Hey.
I've got no place to be.
And no one I'd rather see.
I won't mind if you can find.
The time to stay with me.
Oh I've got no time for wastin'.
Gotta live a life when I can.
I won't hide if you decide.
To let me be your man.
When I get close to you, not much to say.
I get that same old feeling I had in my younger days.
And I can show you the way.
It's just a game we play.
It's easy, takin' it day by day.
Hey.
You know I would concede.
And I think we both agree.
You and I can testify.
That love is what we need.
Just take a look around you, livin' for the future is blind.
I believe what we can achieve will soon be left behind.
The things I try to say are so hard to find.
If you doubt what your love is about it can ease you mind.
And I can show you the way.
It's just a game we play.
It's easy, takin' it day by day.
Hey.
I've got no place to be.
And no one I'd rather see.
I won't mind if you find.
That you're in love with me.
Well we got no time to worry.
Gotta live a life when I can.
I won't hide if you decide.
To let me be your man.
And I can show you the way.
It's just a game we play.
It's easy, takin' it day by day.

If I said what's on my mind.
You'd turn and walk away.
Disappearing way back in your dreams.
It's so hard to be unkind.
So easy just to say.
That everything is just the way it seems.
You look up at me.
And somewhere in your mind you see.
A man I'll never be.
If only I could find a way.
I'd feel like I'm the man you believe I am.
And it gets harder every day for me.
To hide behind this dream you see.
A man I'll never be.
I can't get any stronger.
I can't climb any higher.
You'll never know just how hard I've tried.
Cry a little longer.
And hold a little tighter.
Emotions can't be satisfied.
You look up at me.
And somewhere in your mind you see.
A man I'll never be.
If only I could find a way.
I'd feel like I'm the man you believe I am.
And it gets harder every day for me.
To hide behind this dream you see.
A man I'll never be.

Well come on.
All you people.
The time has come to get together.
You gotta have a little rock 'n' roll music.
To get you through the stormy weather.
And do whatever you feel.
When you let go.
Nothin's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll.
So come on, put you hands together.
You know it's now or never.
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll.
Ooo are you feelin' satisfied.
Come on let us give your mind a ride.
Ooo are you ready tonight.
Come on let us give your mind a ride You can do what you like.
Come on let us give your mind a ride.
Oh that funky feelin'.
Is what you need to get you through.
You oughta know.
I'll tell you somethin'.
Don't let your troubles get to you.
Cause win or lose it's alright.
Well take control.
And nothin's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll.
So come on.
Put you hands together.
You know it's now or never.
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll.
Ooo are you feelin' satisfied.
Come on let us give your mind a ride.
Ooo are you ready tonight.
Come on let us give your mind a ride You can do what you like.
Come on let us give your mind a ride.

Well you know I don't get off on workin' day after day.
I wanna have some fun while I'm here.
I play the game when it's goin' my way.
And there's nothin' like a party when it's kickin' into gear.
I'm gettin' ready for a party tonight.
Yes I'm gettin' ready to cruise.
And if you've got somethin' for me.
I've got somethin' for you.
Baby.
It's a party and nobody cares.
What we're doin' there.
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there.
It's a party, party, party!
I can't believe it when some people say.
That it's a sin that way we live to die.
You know, there's never been a more natural thing.
Yea there's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie.
So come on.
Get ready for the time of your life.
Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove.
And if you've got somethin' for me.
I've got somethin' for you.
Baby.
It's a party and nobody cares.
What we're doin' there.
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there.
It's a party, party, party!
Yea yea yea yea get down and party if you need a cue.
You're sure to find one in the crowd.
Just meet some friends and have a toke or two.
In a place where they can never play the music too loud.
Get ready for a party tonight.
Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove.
And if you've got somethin' for me.
I've got somethin' for you.
Baby.
It's a party and nobody cares.
What we're doin' there.
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there.
It's a party, party, party!
You know a man doesn't live on bread alone.
He's got to have some lovin' each and every night.
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known.
Let's get together honey, it's alright.

Just let me hear it from your lips.
It's the last thing that I'll ask you to say.
Don't wanna hear it from strangers.
If it's over let me have it straight.
I've been used.
But I'm takin' it like a man.
I'm confused.
But I'm doin' the best that I can.
I've been tossed around plenty before.
I've had this heart of mine broken and more.
I can't find a reason for sure.
But I've gotten used to bad news.

Don't tell me why.
Yes it's over I can see the end.
But please don't lie.
If you're leavin' me like a friend.
I've been tossed around plenty of times.
And I've read between all the lines.
You're just another in the grand design.
And I've gotten used to bad news.
I know what you're sayin' is bad.
It's not what I wanted but I'm ready for that.
I'm ready for that, yea.
I've been used.
But I'm takin' it like a man.
I'm confused.
But I'm doin' the best that I can.
I've been tossed around plenty before.
I've had this heart of mine broken and more.
I can't find a reason for sure.
But I've gotten used to bad news.

Now if you're thinkin' 'bout a love that left you.
Thinkin' you should hide away.
Girl I think it's wrong.
You just try to be strong now babe.
Listen to what I've got to say.
I know the feelin' that you feel today.
But don't be afraid of love.
Tell you how I feel about you.
Tell you what you want to hear.
Tell you that it's true.
But it's all up to you now babe.
Don't let your love disappear.
Can't believe that I'll be stayin' here.
But don't be afraid of love.
Baby don't you know good love is hard to find.
Don't you think I know what's goin' through your mind.
One man left you cryin' so you shut the door.
Just let me inside that's what my love is for.
Tell you how I feel about you.
Tell you what you want to hear.
Tell you that it's true.
But it's all up to you now babe.
Don't let your love disappear.
Can't believe that I'll be stayin' here.
But don't be afraid of love.
