Party Ain't A Party Lyrics

Queen Pen.

1 - Yo, a party ain't a party 'till it's ran all through.
And leave it to my crew, it's gon' be playa' proof.
After three rounds we gon' blow off this roof.
A party ain't a party 'til it's ran all through.

Shorty, who you be, you're staring at me instantly.
As I walk into this vide I can feel you diggin' me.
Wit' yo' glass of Rhemy, you had one too many.
But still I'm impressed wit' cho' wild out Henney.
It's a party and I got's to run all through.
But maybe later on we can chat over booze.
See I thought you knew, ain't no delaying what I'm saying.
Want me to rewind and collect on my track, it won't wait.
I said it's a party, I gots to run all through.
We holding 20 plus we can follow if you choose.
See ain't nothing changed, since the days of the Q.
Except uh, elimination that wanna chew up my crew.
Yes you, but you true I got to browse on through.
You can catch me at the bar being shady to my old crew.
How I do? Make moves like I shoot.
Catch me on the rebound, make at the tunnel.
Catch me on the rebound, or maybe at the tummy.

Mr Cheeks.
I'm tipsy from the cab, down the whole bottle of Henney.
Peepin' shorties in my biz and seeing many.
But there's something about you.

Givin' me that I want to say something look.
Plus that dress you wearin'.
Got my whole team starin'.
You not bouncin' with me, I'm not hearin'.
Lickin' the lips for real like you really want it.
Is you dealing with the cat that's blunted?
Stay forever real shorty Ra', is you down.
To go home wit' the champ a whole round? You see.
I had my eyes on you from way across the room.
You looked so good from over here, I can smell your perfume.
I assume, if I got ta come and get ya.
Ya'd think I was only out to hit ya.
See, you's an intelligent chick.
With that Nestle type of smile.
Held my temptations back for awhile.
Tell my brother Tah Lee, I'll be back, yeah.
That's Pretty Lou and Spigg Nice, so watch my jacket.
Make her touch to my lips, put the drink in my hand.
'Till the center my legs expand.
Cuz.

Freeky Tah.
That's how we do.
Better forget her for me and you.
I give a shout out to my whole crew.
From New York City to Chicago too.

Markell Riley.

Now a party ain't a party until I run through it.
Pick 'em stick 'em sick 'em, that how I do it.
Move it, get down keepin' ya'll movin'.
Certified game tight prove it, aight!
Deala of the dancefloor, makin' all ya'll stomp and clap.
Ya feelin' me?, damn sure.
I had the answers for ya dancers.
Since way back, puttin' it down like that.

Nutta Butta.

I came in the door, 20 or more.
Watch the dancefloor, cause we like it raw.
Dom got my head spinnin' like a set of rims.
Nutta Butta like a pair of Timbs.
What the deal shorty?, wanna rock with me.
Take ya back, do the wop wit' me.
Spend the cash like Monopoly.
Words slurred and my vision is blurred.
But a party ain't a party 'til I slide with a bird, what?
