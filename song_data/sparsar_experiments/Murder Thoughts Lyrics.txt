Murder Thoughts Lyrics
by Yung B from Farlin.


This music is my life, Farlin is my passion.
Sometimes I can be coldhearted, no compassion.
I wouldn't suppose to make it 25.
On top of that I made it out the hood alive.

Murder, murder, murder 'round my way.
I'm having thoughts about the shit like everyday.
If they don't understand then they gon' tell us pray.
But that ain't stop lil' homie from gettin' hit wit' that K.

Murder rate ain't going down, ain't going down.
In my city they lay it down, blood they lay it down.
Niggas be with that jaw jacking, all that jaw jacking.
Me and my niggas make it happen, blood we make it happen.

That's how it is in the field, blood real in the field.
Show signs of weakness you'll get killed, blood you gon' get killed.
Turn on the news it's off the chain, blood it's off the chain.
Ain't no mercy they bussing brains, blood they bussing brains.

The police murdered Michael Brown, then they tried to keep it quiet.
On every national news, St. Louis starting a riot.
Reverand Al Sharpton trippin', that nigga wasting his time.
Ain't no justice in my city, 'cept niggas slangin' that iron.

Closing all these fuckin' schools, all niggas got left is dealin'.
The jackin', crackin', and stealin', and felony no appealin'.
Let's be honest I been gangbangin', since '04.
With my pistol cocked, and that Curtis Blow.

My trap boomin' like Looney Tunes, I'm a OG off that Farlin block.
Blind to the facts, 9 to the Mac oooh she sexy.
Not the type that I'd marry though.
Probably one of them crazy hoes.

I, I can't save 'em, cause they sink fast and they can't swim.
I, I don't blame 'em, cause they homegirls just like them.
Sick and tired of all that bullshit and stress.
Niggas keep bringin' up my name, knowing damn well they ain't gon' flex.

Got that pistol charge for that strap.
Got that crack charge for that sack.
Couldn't find a place to rest.
'Til I got savage on my chest that's why it's.

Murder, murder, murder 'round my way.
I'm having thoughts about the shit like everyday.
If they don't understand then they gon' tell us pray.
But that ain't stop lil' homie from gettin' hit wit' that K.

And we gon' do it big man no matter what they say.
Can't never take my spirit Blood cause we gon' shine today.
And we gon' do it big man no matter what they say.
Can't never take my spirit Blood cause we gon' shine today.

Murder, murder, murder 'round my way.
I'm having thoughts about the shit like everyday.
If they don't understand then they gon' tell us pray.
But that ain't stop lil' homie from gettin' hit wit' that K.
