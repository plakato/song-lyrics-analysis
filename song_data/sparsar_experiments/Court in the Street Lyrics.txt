Court in the Street Lyrics
by 415.


D-Loc.
D-Loc's the name, I got a thang against police.
Nigga, I'm straight from the streets.
Fuck a punk in a blue suit.
Wanna get em up, let's go, but I just might blast you.
In this game the rules is you lose.
Duck to the side but you still get choosed.
If I miss, shit, you ain't save.
My homeboy Rich kicks up the backfire.

Richie Rich.
So on the first note I'm steppin off like this.
A brother only gets through life if he's serious.
Givin ain't shit, but see, takin is a method.
Even if you use a weapon.
You see, the law ain't straight, so why follow it.
I'd rather have you give me some poison and say 'swallow it'.
But now fuck that, I'm much sharper.
I eat and shit too, but I'm much darker.
So on the strenght of my color I get pushed and harassed.
Taken to jail with no questions asked.
It's sort of like apartheid, there's no peace.
We're holdin court in the streets.

Richie Rich.
As a positive gangster with the motive to move on the Town.
Uzis greased, ski masks pulled down.
And when it's time to move I roll a bucket.
So if I kill up shit, fuck it.
I'm up outta there, it's time to hit me a fence.
Ditch my gat and get a room at the SixPence.
Shower and change to get up out of the black.
And then I'm back.
I'm in the streets again, I read a paper.
That says: At large.
A killer with a helluva charge.
His name was Richie Rich.
His motive - to start shit.
You got a gat and badge, I'm not duckin.
Fuck the Klans, the Kluin and the Kluckin.
You see, I know that shit, I'm not a dummy.
And when they get me down to the station and try to run me.
I cold got a alias that will never ever fail.
You say that it does, then I will quickly post bail.
Then back to the streets to get my money on and pop.
Throw away the tickets and say 'fuck the cops'.
Am I goin to court? Hell nah, you serious?
Man, I'm gettin furious.
Cause the way things look we'll never have peace.
I'm holdin court in the street.

D-Loc.
It ain't easy in this time and age.
See, those are rough days, locked away in a muthafuckin cage.
Never will they catch a young brother like me again.
I'm gonna run until eternity ends.
Fuck that, I'm not havin it.
It don't make sense cause it's just dumb bullshit.
Be in court on a certain date and certain time?
A nigga like me hits the borderline.
I ain't goin out like a sucker.
I strive too hard for mines, muthafucka.
Think you can take what I built and break it down?
Suprisize, you got a bullet in your crizzown.
Cause I ain't the one to be played.
Gettin paid is my prerogative.
You think not? Well, then think again.
Think about the shit that I talk.
Because I don't take shorts I just dust a muthafucka off.
Come up or run up on me.
But when you step to the Locster, don't come weak.
Be prepared for do or die, you lose your life.
Cause when you're fuckin with Loc, it ain't nothin nice.
So to the punk police I'm sayin this:.
Drop the gat and let's get with it.
I ain't trippin, we can't have peace.
You wanna talk to me, let's hold court in the streets.
