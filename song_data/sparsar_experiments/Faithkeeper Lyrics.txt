Faithkeeper Lyrics
by Unleash The Sky.

Put your arms around me.
Lay your head on my chest.
Can you see it? Can you feel it?
Behind the horizon.
I can see the promised land.
Can you see it? Can you feel it?

Into the unknown.
No matter where the journey ends.
Step by step, you're not alone.

You can put your faith in me.
I will show you something better.
Take a look behind the horizon.
It gets better.

Thousand gulls, a thousand above our heads.
Keep singing their song.
A melody of freedom.

Into the unknown.
As long as I can see your light.
Side by side, you're not alone.

Into the unknown.
Far away.
Into the unknown.
Chasing the sun from today.
