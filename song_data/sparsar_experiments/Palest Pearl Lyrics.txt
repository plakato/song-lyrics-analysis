Palest Pearl Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.


Payless world
The pearl of greatest prides
Born, first form
It's, all you wanted
But you caught up in the rush
Of love
Do. You really want that. Much
Trust
Amaze, your mind
It's curling over line
In, the finest curls

There, is lighting. All these lines
You caught up in the rush
Of lost
Do. You really wanted much

Trust
Does it make. You want to run
The touch
Or. Do you want to turn to dust
From lost

Payless world
The pearl of greatest prides
Payless world
There is lighting. All these lines
Payless world
World of greatest prides
Payless world
There is lighting. All these lines
