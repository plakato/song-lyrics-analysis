Bitter Melon Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

A hammer of purple shit.
Bashes down on your fantasy.
Fantasy piled upon the fantasy.
That maybe now you are free.

Little boy, can I ever love you enough.
Little boy, can I face you truly enough.
Can I ever pat your head gently enough.
Can I ever smile at you honestly enough.
Can I keep dread far from your heart enough.
No, I cannot.

When I am near you.
Everything everything everything.
Is worth its cost.
Your dad told me he has no feelings.
Now I understand.

Little boy, can I ever love you enough.
Little boy, can I face you truly enough.
Can I ever pat your head gently enough.
Can I ever smile at you honestly enough.
Can I keep dread far from your heart enough.
