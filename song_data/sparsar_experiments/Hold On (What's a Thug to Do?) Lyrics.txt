Hold On (What's a Thug to Do?) Lyrics
by X-Raided.


When I was young, I wanted to be man of the house.
Have a car, kids, and Vanessa Williams as my spouse.
A dog in the yard, to protect the premises.
Fuck Good Times, I'm talkin' about some of that Cosby shit.
Four bedroom home, white trimmed with green.
I'll be a doctor, regular American dream.
I'll go to college, obtain some knowledge and a degree.
I'll go to Stanford, CSUS, or maybe UCB.
Could go to law school, try to pass the bar.
I could be a fireman, maybe a movie star.
Could play hoops and be the next Mike J.
Gettin' paid for a game I like to play anyway.
Man, so many options, which will I choose?
Pursuin' my dreams and I'm willin' to pay dues.
Gotta take care of Mama, I'ma buy her a house too.
Look out for my sister, the first thing I'ma do.
When I'm rich, no more apartments full of roaches.
We'll have the best of everything, at least that's what I'm hopin'.
So in the innocence of youth, I stand strong.
As my future unfolds I keep holdin' on.

Hold on, never let 'em see you shed a tear.
My soul's gone, on the inside I've been dead for years.
Hold on.
Mama, all my love's for you.
So much drama in the World, what's a thug to do?

Now it's deep, it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic.
Cuz life as an adult ain't quite what I expected.
Bills to pay and mouths to feed.
Everybody askin' for what they want, instead of what they need.
I thought it would be easy, I was mistaken.
Thought my folks would have my back, but they be fakin'.
I went to the pen instead of college.
Tryin' to have more than a dollar in my wallet.
Fucked around and got a girl pregnant.
My baby.
Won't be neglected the way my Daddy did me.
All of my dreams turned to nightmares.
And if I tell you about it, maybe you might care.
I got a  girl pregnant but she got an abortion.
Said I wasn't disciplined and didn't have caution.
Didn't want her only child to be fatherless.
She told me I would be dead before next autumn hits.
I disagree, but maybe she's right in a sense.
Cuz I'm a G until the day they put me in the crypt.
No bullshit.
Hard livin' got me on one.
Until the day I D-I-E I'ma be holdin' on.
Standin' strong.

Holidays come and go kinda quick in the pen.
I got a call from my sister, it's my birthday again.
I barely noticed, deuce-five to life for murder.
On Thanksgiving they fed us potato tots and hamburgers.
I made my bed, but it's too hard to be layin' in it.
Fightin' the drama, but for some reason I'm stayin' in it.
Writin' to Mama, Can your son get a visit?
I'm feelin' a little depressed, can you tell me what is it?
What you suggest? I'm stressed out beyond belief..
So much weight on my chest daily, I'm missin' the streets..
Got me stretched out like a pregnant lady's belly.
X-Raided is stagnated and it's drivin' me crazy.
I created this situation, I know that's the truth.
No father figures in the ghetto, but that ain't no excuse.
Mama excuse my behavior please.
Feels like my soul's gone.
Pray for your only son, need to be strong.
And hold on.

Hold on, never let 'em see you shed a tear.
My soul's gone, on the inside I've been dead for years.
Hold on.
Mama, all my love's for you.
So much drama in the World, what's a thug to do?
Hold on.......shed a tear.
My soul's gone.......dead for years.

Hold on.
Mama, all my love's for you.

So much drama in the World, what's a thug to do?
