It's On Freestyle Lyrics
by Z-Mane.


Yeah.....
Y'all ready?
Gon' tell 'em it's on.

Okay, it's time to let these bustas know what it is.
It's just that young boy Z still handling biz.
Still repping D-Town Davis with all the fine ladies.
But I'm back in O-City and yep, I'm going crazy.
On the beat and on the mic, I do my thing all day and night.
Y'all niggas ain't on my level, y'all ain't even in my sight.
I'm Stevie Wonder when I'm looking at these little punks.
See, I will not trust these little bitty bustees.
I bust on em, I cannot trust none of 'em.
Cause when I come through, these niggas try to rush on me.
But it's cool, though, you just a fool, hoe.
And when Z-Mane come on through, it's just like fool's gold.
All gold everything, on my T. James.
Niggas hating on me, I don't care, y'all some lames.
Cause I done been here, you niggas sitting here.
They say, Z-Mane, you different!, nigga, I been weird.
Ha, I'm just crazy on the mic and insane in the booth.
These niggas speaking the lies, but me, I'm speaking the truth.
The best thing to come up out of OK since Q.
Or Caspa Loc, yeah, you know what it do.
Ugh, still the Young Balla, what up to my brother J?
Down in D-Town holding it down like everyday.
Going straight up off the dome, no pen and no pad.
Why you do that, Z-Mane? Cause I ain't got time for that.
Looking at my watch and it's about that time.
To do what? Just to make another classic rhyme.
Ha.... had to stop for a minute.
Then I'm right back in it, got your freaking head spinning.
I'm.... going insane in the braaain.
Other niggas hating on me but they just... lames.
Y'all already know what it is.
It's just the boy Z to the Just-Handling-It.
Okay, repping Royalty until the day I go.
So much white girls, looking like it's snowing.
Ha, what up to the Latinas?
I'm all about my green, bruh, you niggas ain't seen none.
Whoa, where you looking? Your girlfriend, she be cooking.
I ain't talking about that other stuff, she really is cooking.
Chicken on the stove, biscuits in the oven.
Naw, I'm just fronting, now ain't they something?
It's on.

Interlude.
Y'all, I'm just going crazy.
I don't even know what I'm saying.
It's just some... Naw, keep it going.
Keep it going.
Gon' tell them it's on, though.
Alrite....

It's the Boy in Blue and I stay so true.
And you already know what it do with my crew.
And I rep that R.G.O.D. until the day I go.
Y'all already know, yes, the flow is so cold.
Like burr, what up to Gucci Mane?
He already know, it's that boy Z-Mane.
What up to my homeboys? Royalty Gang.
Standing up like all day everyday.
What up to Lite Brite Afrikn, that's the real G.
And all you ladies tryna holla, just chill, please.
What up to T-Rone? Yeah, the real T-Rone.
AKA Terrence Tyrone, yep, we going strong.
My nigga King Henry, yeah, we stay so cold.
If you try to touch my brother, I'll knock you out cold!
And my boy Drei? I mean, what can I say?
He got his style up and he's swagging like everyday, all day.
Royalty!

Yeah..
Oh, is it done? Is it done?
Oh okay *laughs*, nigga, I told you I was gon' freestyle that.
I told you I could do it.

Naw, I didn't write that!
Naw.
Yeah, I don't know.
This is just something I felt like doing.
Just clowning around, y'all, so.....
Quick shoutout to all the bros I mentioned on there.
And Trotman City, you know what I'm saying?
Temp2uece, Armyboy, Phillip Flame, Switch City, P. Lemoins.
J-Main, Aaliyah on Royalty Gang, Caspa Loc, I see y'all.
This is just something extra, so....
And this is only, what, this is track two?
Yeah, go ahead and play track three.
Because we about to bust on em, let's go!
