Graffiti Lyrics
by S-X.

All alone on the city floor.
Your mother's dead.
And your brother's gone.
You are young.
And you want to inspire.
Roaming on.
In the haze of the city light.
All alone on the city floor.
Your mother's dead.
And your brother's gone.
You are young.
And you want to desire.
Your faith is on tonight.
I really wish you had it all.
Your faith is on tonight.
