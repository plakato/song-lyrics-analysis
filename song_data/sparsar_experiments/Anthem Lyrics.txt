Anthem Lyrics
by Swift.

I am alive.
I feel so free.
Your love came along.
When I thought hope was gone.

And it rescued me.
You lifted me up.
When I was down.
I whispered a prayer.
And my God, You were there.
You stuck around.

And I wanna sing out loud.
For all You've done.
Finish the work in my heart.
That has begun.

Love come rescue me.
Take me away from the world.
And set my spirit free.

Love come rescue me.
Safe in Your arms, Oh, Lord.
Is where I wanna be.

Love come rescue me.
You've opened my eyes.
You've given me peace.
You've given me so much joy.
That sometimes I can't hardly speak.

Now I am redeemed.
And forever will be.
You are my Lord.
And I'm gonna be Yours, eternally.
