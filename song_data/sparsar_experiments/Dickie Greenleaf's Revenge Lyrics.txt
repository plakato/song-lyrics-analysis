Dickie Greenleaf's Revenge Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

He's sitting there with a girl on his arm, working his charm, and I fucking.
hate him.
Standing there with some confident air, making faces at the girls at the bar.
but he's losing.
Face with me, he'll lose face to face with me.

I'll hold out this note and wrap it tight around your throat cause.
I hope when he goes down you go, crashing through rock bottom.
As far as the pacific goes it can't hold a candle to the lyrics that I wrote.
So take it up with them and your radio.

I'm as far as you can see cause I'm a one man army and I'm storming the beach.
Yeah, it's you versus me and I need you like a flesh disease.
Or an internal bleeding that still bleeds.
Like this shit's World War three and the battle's coming.
So tell that chick she made my list, and I'll get to it.
When I finish this song so sing along, sing along.

I'll hold out this note and wrap it tight around your throat cause.
I hope when he goes down you go, crashing through rock bottom.
As far as the pacific goes it can't hold a candle to the lyrics that I wrote.
So take it up with them.

I hope you crash your car to this song when you sing along.
So I hope you sing along, YEAH SING ALONG and.
Tell that chick she made my list, well I'll get to it.
When I finish the bitch she's dating.

I'll hold out this note and wrap it tight around your throat cause.
I hope when he goes down you go, crashing through rock bottom.
As far as the pacific goes it can't hold a candle to the lyrics that I wrote.
So take it up with them and your radio, that you threw out your window.
