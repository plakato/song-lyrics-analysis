Pumpin' Lyrics
by Xplicit Entertainment.


Monday we...').
Tuesday we....
Wednesday we....
Alright and Thursday we....
Friday we....
Saturday we....
Well everyday, we say we....
Alright COOL!

Pumpin'! Pumpin'!

Ayo, we stack we money, get paper.
Cause you know we party hard later.
Mr. Flexx Dem Proper got.
the whole city locked.
Pretty girls in each and every area.
Sipping Hennessy with no chaser.
Cause we party hard, we don't cater.
We got Puncheon, White Oak, Stag &amp; Guinness.
Do it to the max like Beta.
We never stop, call we the Pumpin' Bantons.
We're taking pics with your girl, like Sampson Nanton.
Cruise down the avenue,.
bass-line thumping.
Me and my whole team pull up and, everybody....

Pumpin'! Pumpin'!

Ayo, I's a man does pump real hard.
Hear the scene, where's.
the green?
Get high, swear it seems.
I wouldn't see this in my weirdest dreams.
They fear the team.
We don't play, like online in C.O.D.
A harder crew doesn't exist like the flying squad.
Must go, in Rosscos.
Or frankly, go Frankies.
If the vibes buss though.
To Stumblin, we stampede.
51 or Zen?
We do it big like mampees.
Crew thick like dumplings.
No NP but we pumpin'.
VIBES.

Pumpin'! Pumpin'!

See Pumpin' is a way of life.
That's just the way we roll.
Pumpin' whether day or night.
Let the vibes take control.
See, I work so hard.
So excuse me if I wanna let go, oh no.
You never know when it's your time -.
To the world, it's a message, whoa.
From Trinbago.
Pumpin'!
All night I say we Pumpin'.
Trinidad we Pumpin'.
Tobago we Pumpin'.
Yo, the WHOLE world we Pumpin'.
Oh no no no no no.
Yeah yeah yeah.

Pumpin'! Pumpin'!
