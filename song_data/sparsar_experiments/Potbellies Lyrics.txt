Potbellies Lyrics
by 4 Broz By Broz.

Saruman of many Kronics 
We, don't have potbellies, but we're fat 
We don't have sonar, but we know where it's at 
We're, not radioactive, but we'll melt your face. 
Saruman Steve Genes, 
We rest our case 
 
Phantom, Menace, striking back lyrics. Rushing like Zerg 
Did. I break your concentration. I hope it was insured 
If you're having rhyme trouble. I feel bad for you, son 

If. I had my druthers I'd pen, another with precision. 
Don'T have Shinigami eyes, but I'm a man with vision, 
Step off fool.
