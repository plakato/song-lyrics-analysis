Bullshit Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


Six 0 Breezo the mixtape need I say more.
Niggas ain't wanna let me in but I kick down that door.
I'm here.
Came in the rap game and I'm on bullshit.
I'm still the same nigga from the same hood with a full clip.

Came in the rap game and I'm on bullshit.
I'm still the same nigga from the same hood with a full clip.
And I ain't with that small talk cut the bullshit.
Bitch I'm Breezo from Six 0 this that hood shit.

Dear America, I came for the bullshit.
These niggas rapping like they killers and ain't doing shit.
These bitches acting all mighty but they be doing dicks.
Lil hoe I'm live from 600 and we don't honour shit.
Bitch, these niggas pussy we can sniff them out.
We them killers them fake drillers always talking about.
But bitch I'm rapping for the money, what the fuck is clout.
Clips full of hollow tips and bitch we a bring them out.
Listen closely motherfucker I am not a rapper.
I was born in the audience I'm a fucking clapper.
These niggas should start a team called The Fucking Lackers.
Free Nine and 22 they stressing in that slammer.
This shit bigger than rap, no I'm not kidding.
If I had a mil, bro'nem would not be sitting.
I'm tryna get this money feed my team.
Where I come from yeah it's mean.
So I'm riding with them beams fuck you mean nigga.

See I came for the bullshit.
Still sliding tryna shoot shit.
Bitch we does this.
I'm the new face of this hood shit.
On that long live Lil Boo shit.
Niggas been hoes on that fu shit.
I'm Breezo who is you bitch.
Keep a 30 shot for the loose lips.
No bla bla bitch this true spit.
I'm on 600 with my niggas.
Free all of 'em that's locked.
We was more than that, killers.
So we grew up blowing torches.
Sparking shit burning niggas.
Stay your ass on that porch.
Cause we out here turning niggas.
We on bullshit.
