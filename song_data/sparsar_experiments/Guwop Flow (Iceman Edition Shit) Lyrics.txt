Guwop Flow (Iceman Edition Shit) Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


Iceman edition shit, baby.
Huh?
Niggas already know how I'm rockin', nigga.
Six-O shit, baby, Six-O shit, baby.
Breezo George Gervin Iceman shit.

Iceman shit, bitch, I'm George Gervin.
Ridin' around and I'm servin'.

That nigga, you heard me.
My bitch, she so pretty.
I'm drinkin' that dirty.
This Glock holdin' thirty.
Bitch I score like George Gervin.

Ridin' 'round town, I got yo' bitch with me.
Might sell you a couple zips of this hickory.

And like some kids at dinner time, we be movin' P's.
Feelin' really goofy off these Percys, jeez.
Ruth's Chris shit, ain't no Applebee's.
Two cubans round my neck cost a hundred, G.
And nigga, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm known to squeeze.
600 shit, I spit a hundred ki's.
Pistols everywhere, we causin' murder scenes.
Might take a selfie on some lightskin shit.
But every we club that we in, we get them pipes in, bitch!

Iceman shit, I don't give a fuck.
Ridin' around town with my .45, it ain't tucked.
Balmain Jeans, me? A nigga that zip'em up.

Breezo, whatcha doin'? Bitch, I'm coolin' and boolin'.
Hundred shots, dress 'em up, suit'em and boot'em.
Crackhead hoe, bitch, you smokin' bags.
I got 2 for 25, what you wanna grab?
Hit a fuck nigga with a couple jabs.
I used to stand on the 9 with a hundred bags.
Rich nigga shit, Ballys on my ass.
A hundred racks in each pocket, I ain't trying to brag.
All my ex-bitches lookin' super sad.
Go tell your dusty ass nigga go and chase a bag.
I'm the best nigga bitch could've ever had.
I'm eating hundred dollar steaks, I can't fuck with strags.
If you sneak diss me, nigga, that's yo' ass.
Paparazzi shit, bitch, I'm known to flash.
Rappin' ass nigga wanna act like he Biggie.
Inflate yo' fat ass with this hundred round semi, bitch!

Iceman shit, bitch, I don't give a fuck.
Chiraq to PA to New York, my guns tucked.
Lift this motherfucker, I'll fire this bitch up.

This that Six-O shit, nigga.
