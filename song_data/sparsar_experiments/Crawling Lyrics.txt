Crawling Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Out of bed my limbs are screaming.
Hit the floor I lose another line.
Crawling with the things I'm seeing.
Fix my bones they're coming after me.
I never know but I take more than I can.
Tracking my veins lets me out again.
Tell the dead I'm cold and freezing.
Lie me down I'm ready for the push.
Drag me out I must be sinking.
Put me through before they shut me tight.
I never learn.
Still I take more than I can.
It tracks my veins as it lets me out again.
And it takes me down again.
And it takes me out again.
