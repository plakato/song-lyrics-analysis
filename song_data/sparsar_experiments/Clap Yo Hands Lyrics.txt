Clap Yo Hands Lyrics
by Yukmouth.

He'S Yukmouth 
 
He's Yukmouth, he's thugged out 
He's Yukmouth, he's thugged out thugged out 
Yukmouth he's thugged out 
He's Yukmouth he's thugged out thugged out 
 
If, you're thuggin and you know it clap your hands, 
If you're thuggin and you know it clap your hands. 
If you're thuggin and you know it 
When you're, hustlin nigga show it 
If you're thuggin and you know it clap your hands 
But. If you're ballin - and you know it stomp your feet, 
But if you're ballin and you know it stomp your feet, 
But if you're ballin and you know it 
Shot-callin and you show it 
If, you're ballin and you know it stomp your feet. 
 
Yukmouth pursue the Benjamins. The future, like Timbaland 
Eat shrooms, like Eminem pop X, like Lil', Kim 
Hot, sex to gentlemans, puffin, Havana, 
Bring ya, drugs to Atlanta, if you don't fuck with bammer 
You, only fuck with chron' be poppin, Cris Don 
You rockin Big John's. Your watch is glistenan. 
You ain't watchin, the Pistons inside your dot, six'n 
You got a hot chicken who never stops. Lickin 
I smoke the hash to ashes. My click be draggin, tatted, 
I, probably pop a tablet, but never fuck. With acid 
My bitches be the baddest petite with fat asses 
Proceed to stack the cabbage till we in lavish mansions 
Aiyo. I toast to that my niggas toast to that 
Cause. I was broker back in the days wearin crocker sacks 
Now, I smoke doja! Sacks I'm never goin back 
I got the house, the Jaguar and the Rover black 
 
You, like menage-a-trois, you fuck with exotic broads 
You, drive exotic cars. You smoke chronic by the jars 
Your platinum, teeth, diamond your platinum piece diamond 
You on them streets rhymin, you makin, g's, timin, 
You slap, a bitch out you slap a nigga out; 
You slap, a pimp out. You slap a trick out 
Pistol-whip a snitch down, get hit with a pistol 
We sippin Cris. Now my niggas rich now 
We at them play-offs baby. We at the Super Bowl 
We in Las Vegas baby fight night as usual, 
I switch and gatored out gaffled and papered out 
Pull stretch, Navigators out TV-/PlayStation-ed out 
Y'all niggas hate us now, two thou. I say this now: 
Jackers wan na lay me down rappers wan na spray me down 
But. They can't fuck with Yuk cause. I'M a Thug. Lord 
That's gon' bring em that hardcore. If they want more 
 
You fly to Cancun, you take flights to Jamaica, 
You, love them. Damn shrooms, you love Garcia, Vegas 
You, take flights to the Bahamas. You fight your baby, mama 
That, child payment drama, then flipped her a new Mercedes partner, 
You're, not a Captain. Save Her cause hoes be pullin capers, 
You, smoke'dro, different flavors X, Men like Doctor and Xavier 
Pop pills. Like Christian Slater, you on a mission player 
You, always spendin paper, fuck ice. We gettin glaciers, 
My neck bling-blingin Rolex bling-blingin, 
20 bling-blingin, my set bling-blingin 
But. If it was back in the days, I'd take a nigga, bling 
Take a nigga ring break and make a nigga scream. 
I was slingin powder, sacks I'm where them dollars at 
Till. I holler back at niggas that sip more syrup than Project Pat 
Now, I fuck with Rap-A-Lot I hit the jackpot 
We like to scrap a lot so busters keep your gats cocked .
