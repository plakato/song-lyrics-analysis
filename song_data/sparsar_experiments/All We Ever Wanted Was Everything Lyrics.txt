All We Ever Wanted Was Everything Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

All we ever wanted was everything.
All we ever got was cold.
Get up, eat jelly.
Sandwich bars, and barbed wire.
Squash every week into a day.
The sound of drums is calling.
The sound of the drum has called.
Flash of youth shoot out of darkness.
Factorytown.
Oh, to be the cream.
