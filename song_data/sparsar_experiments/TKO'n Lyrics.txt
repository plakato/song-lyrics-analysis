TKO'n Lyrics
by Two Kings in a Cipher.

Amen-Ra.
Here we come, here we come, we're two kings.
The cipher's complete, spiced up with a smooth beat.
A guaranteed hit, sure to get us paid.
The cut was concieved by Freeze from the hit brigade.

D.O.P..
It's a mellow type of flow, the kind you snap your fingers to.
While you're in your car playing Low Pro.
You're not an MC, but even you start flowing.
Amen-Ra come down, and do a little TKO'n.

Amen-Ra.
All right, let me explain TKO'n.
It's like breaking your curfew, coming in after 3 and.
You're tip-toeing, trying to be slick or very quiet.
It's so smooth your mother and your father try it.
Nodding and bobbing your head is the main reaction.
Then you're tapping and snapping causing a chain reaction.
And the person next to you does the same.
You're acting like really big kids playing one big game.
You begin to recite the rhymes.
Then you hear a hard line and rewind for a foul time.
The record is memorized, your conscious is stimulized.
And you're glowing, we're TKO'n.

D.O.P..
Yes, thy kingdom come.
Two Kings in a Cipher keeping you hyper, children of the sun.
And I bless, the listening ones.
I'm filling your soul and making you whole.
With truth when the rhyme's done.
It sounds kind of wicked, am I correct?
And I didn't even say 1,2 or give a mic check.
Cause I can just grab it and whip it.
A true MC can you dig it? When the rhyme flows, you sip it.
Like drinking champagne with a cutie named Tootie.
TKO'n with a mossie, pimping hard like Rudy.
Looking like 3 the Hard Way.
TK Tone, D.O.P., and on my right the Amen R-A.
Crashing the scene like the A-Team, we're showing off.
Grabbing the mic and we're going off, we're TKO'n.

Amen-Ra.
Here I am, back again, the serpent in the sky.
TKO'n in the sudio making hits when I.
Turn on the boards, set up the reel and run the beat through.
Wait for a minute, rewind, then give the music EQ.
The engineer asks, Who's up, you or D?
I say Me and put my vocals on tracks two and three.
Then I proceed to rip the mic up like a chainsaw.
Brothers falling victim when I'm taking the blame for.
Those who slept, crept he stepped on my.
Ego, D.O.P. come ghetto legal.

D.O.P..
Damn, we're saying fly weak dope shit.
I got a second mic cause the first one I broke it.
But hype hype rhymes I hit harder than a brick.
The DJ will scratch and cut and we will just kick.
Yes the tempo is slow and my voice is low.
So hip hip hooray and away we go.
Behind the M-I-C I'm standing, rhymes I'm rambling.
On, got MC's scrambling, word is bond.
I take a trip and I fly by the power of the eye.
And I know where I'm going, that's TKO'n.
