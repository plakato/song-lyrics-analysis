Ali Lyrics
by 404WILL.


I'm the greatest like Ali.
Ohhhhh ohhhhh.
Float like a butterfly.
Sting like a wild bee.

Killin niggas in the daytime uh huh.
Thrillin niggas it's a wild night uh huh.
Play wit hunnids that's my playtime uh huh.
No sleep this a wild life uh huh.
Ali lace my boots up.
Might call Asher that's my shoota.
Real shelled paratrooper.
Spend a house note pair of shoes huh.
Leave out chuck the deuce up.
A town for my real niggas.
Peep game let the roof up.
Talkin bout 2 door no meal ticket.
Motorola Chirp that's a real cricket.
Chirp chirp don't it feel different.
When they notice you.
But they never speak.
Too used to you SITTIN in the seats.
Now the ball in my hands nigga.
Sayin hi to my fans nigga.
Layin out the floor plan nigga.
From the ground up.
Hammer in hand.
My sound up.
Camera in hand.
Retro snappin.
Forreal.
How did this happen.
Forreal.
Nigga might sign em a deal.
404WILL.

I'm killin im stuntin I'm STUNTIN im killin.
Baby stay down till we make a million.

10 rounds it's a knockout.
Clock in never clock out.
Bet i make you talk.
Bankroll can't walk.
Don't care about costs.
Never take a loss.

Mike Jordan take the last shot.
Everybody love u when the cash hot.
Nigga Primetime.
This my time.
Feelin like Hov sippin my ties.
Nigga Spike Lee filmin movies.
Can't lie I'm feelin groovy.
Muhammad Ali.
Muhammad Ali.
Muhammad Ali.
Said Muhammad Ali.
I'm the greatest like Ali.
Muhammad ali im the greatest.

Flyest nigga since Tuskegee.
I ain't goin cuz she need me.
Nigga lookin a TV.
Show.
Know my exes hate to see me.
Blow.
Know I'm reckless when you see me.
Hoe.
Know I'm dabbin.
Rippin tags off clothes.
Gottem yellin. Yellin 2Pac back.
Gottem askin How did you cop that.
Think da Porsche goin bald.
How the roof drop back.
Sip on that.
Didn't mean to drip on that.
Her lip on that.
Spilling swag.
I Want mine back.
Nevermind I'm finna leak it.
Preachin like a deacon.
You holy as a heathen.
I told em it was our season.
They talk I was talkin greasy.
Nah I'm talkin right now.
Shoot up.
Hide out.
You better turn yo lights out.
