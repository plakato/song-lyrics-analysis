Now What You Want From Me? Lyrics
by Zippy Kid.

Now what ya want from me?

The story goes on and on.
Call me Zippy Kid.
I get first crack to mix this track.
And I perform it perfectly:.
You'll be pleased mightily.
I join my forces to involve.
Rising above the crowd.
Impaste with the tangible sound.
My fidgety is precise.
These beats are elastic and nice.
I poke the rhythm for all that guys-.
They are rolling and twiddling invariably.
When the world is burnin'.
No harmony with the society.
The breaking news raped me.
But I can't change the human history.
And I deprecate with the incisive fluster.
I fight rapidly.
Now what ya want from me?
I check speed for next slow beats.
Chill yourself with the juice directly.
You'll makin' heady,it's the snifin' limit.
Get ready!I will show my feelings.
If you really need it.
Now I spray my eccentricity.
This is how you want to be just like me.
I say we were called to be free.
I'm shifting your stability.
Now what ya want from me?
I wanna inject in you my energy.
These explosive skips and muggy squeeze.
Are frittering me.
I wanna order your temper.
I will save the humanity.
Now what ya want from me?
It's like fast moving process of emerging madness.
It's like imagining kiss of revealing death.
All these explosive skips and muggy squeeze.
And my nice and elastic beats....
Now I'm ready to incite.
I wanna make some outrage on this stage tonight.
It's like my racy extremity.
It's like rhythm of my virginity.
New creative shot for the modern society.
And your tainted wits....
These explosive skips and muggy squeeze.
Are frittering you and me.
Now what ya want from me?
I wanna load in your ears this melody.
Call me Zippy Kid.
I have a great deal of vitality.
To survive in the faked reality.
I offend your dumpy monotony.
I give ya the impulse to inflame.
Now what ya want from me?
Suppose we're goin insane-.
Let's stuff our heads with it again.
I will save the humanity with my bright individuality.
I wanna split this brittle tranquility out and inwardly.
Now what ya want from me?
It's the rest before your learning process.
The story is over.
The last summer party....
Now what ya want from me?
