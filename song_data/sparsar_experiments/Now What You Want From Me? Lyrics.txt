Now What You Want From Me? Lyrics
by Zippy Kid.

Now, what ya want from me, 
 
The story, goes on and on 
Call me Zippy Kid 
I get first crack to mix this track. 
And I perform it perfectly 
You'll, be pleased mightily, 
I join my forces to involve 
Rising above the crowd. 
Impaste with the tangible, sound 
My fidgety is precise, 
These beats are elastic and nice 
I poke the rhythm for all that guys- 
They are rolling and twiddling invariably 
When. The world is burnin' 
No harmony with the society. 
The breaking news raped me 
But. I can't change the human history 
And I deprecate with the incisive, fluster 
I fight rapidly 
Now. What ya want from me 
I check, speed for next slow beats, 
Chill yourself with the juice directly 
You'll makin' heady, it's the snifin' limit, 
Get ready. I will show my feelings 
If. You really need it 
Now I spray. My eccentricity 
This is how you want to be just like me: 
I say we were called to be free, 
I'm, shifting your stability 
Now. What ya want from me 
I wan na inject in you, my energy 
These explosive skips and muggy squeeze 
Are frittering me 
I wan, na order. Your temper 
I will save the humanity 
Now. What ya want from me 
It's like fast moving process of emerging madness, 
It's like imagining kiss of revealing death 
All these explosive skips and muggy squeeze 
And. My nice and elastic beats ... 
Now. I'M ready to incite 
I wan na make some outrage on this stage tonight. 
It'S, like my racy extremity 
It's, like rhythm of my virginity, 
New creative shot for the modern society 
And your tainted wits, ..., 
These, explosive skips and muggy squeeze 
Are frittering you and me 
Now. What ya want from me, 
I wan na load in your ears, this melody 
Call me Zippy Kid 
I have a great deal of vitality, 
To survive in the faked reality. 
I offend your dumpy monotony 
I give ya the impulse to inflame 
Now. What ya want from me? 
Suppose we're goin insane- 
Let's stuff, our heads with it again 
I will save the humanity with my bright individuality, 
I wan na split this brittle tranquility out and inwardly 
Now. What ya want from me 
It's the rest before your learning process. 
The story is over 
The. Last summer, party, ... 
Now. What ya want from me?
