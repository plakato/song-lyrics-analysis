Bad to the Bone Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Fifty years ago with the world at war.
Hands bloodied - devastated.
Better believe they're back for more.
Pounding the world with a fist of steel.
Jack booted, heavy handed.
Careless of the pain we feel.

Bastards - throwing life away.
Killers - alive today.

Oh oh oh oh.
Don't tell no lies.
I see through your eyes.
You're bad to the bone.
Oh oh oh oh.
Don't tell no lies.
You can't hear the cries.
'Cos you're bad to the bone.

Times have changed but he don't know.
Zoot suit, black tie.
Careless that the lies are low.
One for all and all for one.
Talking smooth - hidden truth.
Time bomb ticking just begun.

Standing alone for the world to see.
Non-starter - push harder.
He still believes his time will come.
Small wonder - old thunder.
Can't he see that he's wrong.
