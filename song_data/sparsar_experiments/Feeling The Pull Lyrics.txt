Feeling The Pull Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Well I'm heading back to pack a bag.
To head out on the road.
To take away what I know is mine.
And I'm running down and past the yellow house.
With Joe into the breeze where no one seems to care.

And I'm feeling the pull.
Dragging me off again.
And I'm feeling so small.
Against the sky tonight.

Well stories of an open light.
And every time we work ourselves up into a rage.
We smash and grab.
And pull the handle no one says but everybody.
Wants to be the one just climbing out.

And I'm feeling the pull.
Dragging me off again.
And I'm feeling so small.
Against the big sky tonight.
Tonight, yeah.

And I'm feeling the pull.
Dragging me off again.
And I'm feeling so small.
Against the big sky tonight.

And I'm feeling the pull.
Dragging me on again.
And I'm feeling so small.
Against the big moon sky tonight.
Tonight, oh.
