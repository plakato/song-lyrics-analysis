Ballers Feud Lyrics
by Yukmouth.


That's the Ballers Feud.
A thug changes, and love changes.
That's the Ballers Feud.
And best friends become strangers.

Survey says....
You know some fake mutha fuckas.
I know some bustas too.
This fake mutha fucka been causin rukus in my crew.
Since '92.
At first I thought he was cool like Dru.
Always hollerin the Dangerous Crew, but if you only knew.
Them niggas don't wanna hang wit you.
Cuz of the thangs you do.
Learn a thang or two.
Talkin bad bout yo homies, two bitches who juss be framin you.
Niggas thinkin bout hangin you, the game is true.
Everywhere we go the punk hoo bangin you.
Makes it kinda hard for me to swang wit you.
That's why niggas only hang wit Dru, my pimpydoo.
Folk-el, smoke out my Range Rove-el.
What? What?
Fuck these broke-els.
I hate it when niggas be playin wit yo mail, because they only end up.
Smoked out.
Broke as hell.
Drivin buckets.
I'm drivin luxury cars and plus shit.
Benz the Lexus the roughest to fuck wit.
So you wanna be P-I-M-P?
You need to get a bitch to fuck you fo free.
You payin G's fo pussy.

** 2x.

There's too many playas.
Too many ballas.
Too many hustlas.
Too many killas.
Too many pimped out mutha fuckas.
So now we got the east coast and the west coast feudin to see who's.
Cleanest.
The cleanest mutha fucka is the richest and the genius.
What if you stumbles, like buyin too many houses.
Wit rims to put on yo shit, too many furry couches.
Who the mouses nigga, I think you knowin.
Sheadin tears from bitches who take yo shit and keep goin.
An don't come back, cuz they done sucked you dick and yo cabbage.
Got 20 hoes across America livin lavish.
Hatin is juss a ho thang, yo, I gotta live like that.
A bitch can roll wit me, or hit the track.
You can talk about pimpin, you can talk about killin.
But when that shit goes down, sound minds will be revealin.
When you die and comeback, maybe you can try again and beat me.
But don't try now, cuz you niggas can't see me.
22, ready to hoo ride at moments notice.
First to swang, hittin noses, eyes can't focus.
Hocus pocus.
Now 25 niggas on ya.
Juss because you moved from California.
Ballers Feud.

** 2x.

We went from loved ones, on the way up.
To no love at all.
Time to go though, so I don't give no fucks at all.
Cross the game.
Don't be playin, stoned get right.
I shed blood wit this, and that can't be gone, overnight.
This hate.
Man, could be a cold mutha fucka.
Close friends, close as cat scan, love 'em like my brother.
Now I.
See 'em dyin like a mutha fucka.
Slow death, no breath.
Man I love it like my mother.
And that's some cold shit, I'm on some mo' swole shit.
Listen quick.
Fingers thick.
Lady clit.
Piss this shit, on yo clit.
Niggas know I'm flossin K-Cash.
Cash foldin.
You want what I'm holdin, my wife an my life stolen.
Worse enemy, authority.
Police are all enemy.
Richeously, this life fo' me ain't as bad as it seems to be.
But still in all I love, all I love.
Take my ten fingers, my ten toes, an mash outta love.
Do it fo ya'll, all ya'll.
My baby girl an God.
This crazy world like a knife in the heart of my cause.
Now half part of me hard.
The other part of me scarred.
Death wit out health, but still a nigga prayin to God.

** 4x.
