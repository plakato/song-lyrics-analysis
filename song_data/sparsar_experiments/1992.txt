Writin rhymes thinkin how Ima be on.
Whatever on is Ima go beyond and beyond.
And pee on the pee-ons with the vicious flow.
Bitches know I'll have em singin like figaro.
Have the girls on they knees like macaro.
Spaz in between the lines, John Macenroe.
Jus defendin my chips like the Packers tho.
You a pregnant chick, you don't have a flow.
Period.
I'm in Defam crew neck.
Lovewright boots so hot I gotta cool it.
The leather so soft, the cow must have been a pussy.
Good wood necklaces and hat by stussy.
Seeing eye glasses make me see 20/20.
Tryna get the money money like it ain't funny funny.
Look sonny, I get ill when I flex these pipes.
You plus rap?
Taxes and Wesley snipes.
Get it?
