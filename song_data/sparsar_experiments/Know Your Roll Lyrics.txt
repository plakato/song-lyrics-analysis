Know Your Roll Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


All you do is tell me what I know.
You say I don't got no money I don't got nothing to show.
For the hours that I'm in the studio.
Every time I'm here you think I got all the hoes.
In reality I'm really with my bros.
All we do is chill get another one to roll.
I don't think you ever knew your role.

It's like I stepped into a golden place.
When I saw ya face all the pain in my soul start to go away.
I called you over but you over me.
You don't want to deal with the rain and the scars from the older days..
Remember when you use to hold my face.
Look me in the eyes for a second.
So the world don't take control of me.
Then you chose to skate like a roller rink.
You used to call me daddy in ya ovaries.
Now I hit the town on the weekends while you sleep in.
Don't be jumping off the deep end.
All my friends that I used to defend.
If you don't like them, how you like me, when in like them?
I let you be the ref. you said that I'm the one that came foul so you left.
I hope you're blessed.
And only time tells, when time fails.
I hope you lived a good life and had your time filled for real.

All you do is tell me what I know.
You say I don't got no money I don't got nothing to show.
For the hours that I'm in the studio.
Every time I'm here you think I got all the hoes.
In reality I'm really with my bros.
All we do is chill get another one to roll.
I don't think you ever knew your role.

Don't be so quick to flip.
Admit that you were mad when you said those things.
You pretend that you were jokin bout the shit that you mean.
Nah that ain't nice love, you've been deceitful.
And if you never had no faith than what you leap for, Yeah.
I think it's better that we parted ways.
Tho it's hard to say, but we threw each other shade through the coldest days.
Making gestures to receive a praisin'.
Just so you can bring it up in altercations.
With ya alter ego when we got in front of people.
Got me lookin like I beat you just so somebody can see you.
That's why I don't want a redo.
It's never finna change we can never be the same.
Used to be my sunshine never thought I rained.
Used to have them sunlines, apple bottom frame.
Just to compliment my swing.
All's well If it don't end well.
I know I'm finna to miss you but it's been real.

All you do is tell me what I know.
You say I don't got no money I don't got nothing to show.
For the hours that I'm in the studio.
Every time I'm here you think I got all the hoes.
In reality I'm really with my bros.
All we do is chill get another one to roll.
I don't think you ever knew your role.
