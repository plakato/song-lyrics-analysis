From The Dust Returned A Titan Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

La la la la la la la la.
La la la la la la la la.

Oh.
And so it begins.
And so it begins.
From within.
The depths of the dying earth.
It has given birth.
To a terrible thing that has broke free from it's cage.

Night is.
Night is.
Falling fast.

Time is.
Time is.
Here at last.

The leviathan.
The leviathan.
Has come again.
And an army of agony.
It will surely bring.
The spell is upon us and has us tightly in its grip.

Night is.
Night is.
Falling fast.

Time is.
Time is.
Here at last.

From the dust returned a titan.
From the dust returned a titan.

Ancient name whispered in the darkness.
Lost words spoke from chattering teeth.
Bloody runes forbode the arrival.
Of the beast that no longer sleeps.

This is the end of everything we know my darling.
This is simply the end.
Such safety finds us.
Trembling lambs environed by wolves.

Heaven is shuttering.
Heaven is shuttering.
Hope is lost.
And soon there will be a flood.
Of angels weeping blood.
Grim retribution for our many unnumbered crimes.

Night is.
Night is.
Falling fast.

Time is.
Time is.
Here at last.

Hell is assembling.
Hell is assembling.
Humanity.
Has reached its bitter end.
No time to make amends.
Up from the pits crawl the unnamable faceless ones.

Night is.
Night is.
Falling fast.

Time is.
Time is.
Here at last.

From the dust returned a titan.
From the dust returned a titan.

Ancient name whispered in the darkness.
Lost words spoke from chattering teeth.
Bloody runes forbode the arrival.
Of the beast that no longer sleeps.

This is the end of everything we know my darling.
This is simply the end.
Such safety finds us.
Trembling lambs environed by wolves.

Well, it is far too late to change our ways.
Now that the curtain has been raised.
Events we've witnessed can never be unseen.

We walk alone.
To atone.
Into the unknown.

We walk alone.
To atone.
Into the unknown.

Well, all that will be left is scattered stones.
Of forgotten cities long gone.
The things we've witnessed can never be unseen.

We walk alone.
To atone.
Into the unknown.

We walk alone.
To atone.
Into the unknown.
