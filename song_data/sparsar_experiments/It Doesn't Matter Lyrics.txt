It Doesn't Matter Lyrics
by Tyler Collins.

It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

Who's to say when love.
Will knock on your heart.
So be ready to let it in.

And who can tell if love.
Is real before it starts.
You never know until you're in it.

So don't hear them when they whisper.
That this love is not enough for you.
Cause they know they'll never find.
True love like yours and mine.
And that's the bottom line.

Oh, oh, it doesn't matter.
What your friends all say.
It don't matter, love you anyway.
It doesn't matter cause.
You stay on my mind.

It doesn't matter.
What you put me through.
It don't matter.
Gonna keep on loving you.
It doesn't matter.
Cause you stay in my life.

Rumours fly when people.
Have something to fear.
It's no telling about it, no.

Just weaving lies for.
Anyone who wants to hear.
Some people just can't.
Do without it, no.

So don't listen when they tell you.
That this love is never gonna last.
Cause they know they'll never find.
True love like yours and mine.
And that's the bottom line.

Remember, it doesn't matter.
What your friends all say.
It don't matter, love you anyway.
It doesn't matter cause.
You stay on my mind.

Oh, oh, it doesn't matter.
What you put me through.
It don't matter.
Gonna keep on loving you.
It doesn't matter.
Cause you stay in my life.

It doesn't matter.
What your friends all say.
It don't matter, love you anyway.
It doesn't matter cause.
You stay on my mind.
Stay on my mind, all the time, yeah.

It doesn't matter.
What you put me through.
It don't matter.
Gonna keep on loving you.
It doesn't matter.
Cause you stay in my life.

Oh, I'll never leave you.
All the way, yeah.
Won't have to beg you.
To stay with me.

Oh, oh, I'll prove it to you.
That my love is real.
By the way it feels.

By the way, by the way.
The way it feels.

It doesn't matter.
What your friends all say.
It don't matter, love you anyway.
It doesn't matter cause.
You stay on my mind.

It doesn't matter.
What you put me through.
It don't matter.
Gonna keep on loving you.
It doesn't matter.
Cause you stay in my life.

It doesn't matter.
What your friends all say.

It don't matter, love you anyway.

It doesn't matter cause.
You stay on my mind.
Stay on my mind, all the time, yeah.

It doesn't matter.
What you put me through.

It don't matter.
Gonna keep on loving you.

It doesn't matter.
Cause you stay in my life.

Oh, yeah.
It don't matter.

oh, yeah.

All right now.

Oh, yeah.
