Eve of Destruction Lyrics
by The Undead.


The eastern world.
It is explodin'.
Violence flaring, bullets loading.
You're old enough to kill.
But not for votin'.
You don't believe in war.
Then what's that gun you're totin'.
When even the Jordan River has bodies floating.
But you tell me.
Over and over and over again my friend.
You don't believe we're on.
The Eve of Destruction.
Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say.
Can't you feel the fear that I feel today.
If the button i's pushed there's no running away.
There'll be no one to save.
With the world in a grave.
Take a look around you boy.
It's bound to scare you boy.
But you tell me.
Over and over and over again my friend.
You don't believe we're on.
The Eve of Destruction.
My blood's so mad.
Feels like coagulating.
And I'm just sitting here.
Contemplating.
I can't change the truth.
It has no regulation.
A handful of senators.
Won't pass legislation.
And marchers alone.
Can't bring integration.
When human respect.
Is disintegrating.
This whole damn world.
Is too frustrating.
But you tell me.
Over and over and over again my friend.
You don't believe we're on.
The Eve of Destruction.
Think of all the hate.
There is in Red China.
Then take a look around.
To Selma, Alabama.
You might leave here.
For four days in space.
But when you return.
It's the same bloody place.
The beating of the drums.
And the pride and discgrace.
You can bury yout dead.
But don't hleave a trace.
And hate your next-door-neighbor.
But don't forget to say grace.
But you tell me.
Over and over and over again my friend.
You don't believe we're on.
The Eve of Destruction.
Yeah, you don't believe we're on.
The Eve of Destruction.
