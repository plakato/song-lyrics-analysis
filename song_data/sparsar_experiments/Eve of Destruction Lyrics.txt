Eve of Destruction Lyrics
by The Undead.


The eastern world 
It is explodin' 
Violence flaring bullets, loading, 
You're old enough to kill 
But, not for votin' 
You, don't believe in war 
Then. What'S that gun, you're totin' 
When, even the Jordan River has bodies floating 
But. You tell me 
Over and over and over again my friend 
You, don't believe we're on 
The Eve of Destruction. 
Don'T, you understand what I'm tryin' to say. 
Can'T. You feel the fear that I feel today 
If the button i's pushed there's no running away. 
There'Ll be no one to save 
With the world in a grave 
Take. A look around you boy, 
It's bound to scare you boy, 
But! You tell me 
Over and over and over again my friend 
You, don't believe we're on 
The Eve of Destruction, 
My blood's, so mad 
Feels, like coagulating 
And, I'm just sitting here, 
Contemplating 
I can't change the truth. 
It has no regulation. 
A handful of senators 
Won't pass legislation. 
And marchers alone 
Can't bring integration, 
When human respect, 
Is disintegrating 
This whole damn world 
Is, too frustrating 
But. You tell me 
Over and over and over again my friend 
You, don't believe we're on 
The Eve of Destruction. 
Think of all the hate 
There is in Red China. 
Then take a look around 
To Selma Alabama 
You might leave here 
For four days in space 
But when you return 
It's the same bloody place: 
The beating of the drums 
And the pride and discgrace 
You can bury yout dead, 
But, don't hleave a trace. 
And hate your next-door-neighbor 
But, don't forget to say, grace 
But, you tell me 
Over and over and over again my friend 
You, don't believe we're on 
The Eve of Destruction. 
Yeah, you don't believe we're on 
The Eve of Destruction
