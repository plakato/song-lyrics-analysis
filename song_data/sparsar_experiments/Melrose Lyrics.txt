Melrose Lyrics
by XP.


Someone gave you all my love, baby.
All my love.
All my love.

They say keep your head up and stay smooth.
But how can I when girls love leaving my heart bruised.
He's so funny and so nice.
So I'm gonna put him in the friend-zone like Khaled's wife.
But through it all I kept a big smile.
And up til now I've been just letting it compile.
But That's it I got you bitch.
I'm stuck in the dark a pterodactyl In a tar pit.
See now it's no more mister nice guy.
Dude talk shit I'm leaving him with a black eye.
Broke arm, snapped spine.
Ratchet bitch, fish fries, I'll hang a bitch by her leggings.
That's what I call a necktie.
You thought you could fool me.
XP on the track motherfucking unruly.
I'm throwing em' in the back of the ac with a mac.
Filled with all of my love cause you snatched it.
And that's it.

Someone gave you all my love, baby.
All my love.
All my love.

Wee ooh wee ooh no no no no no.

x3.
