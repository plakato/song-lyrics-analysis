Township Music Lyrics
by PureMatics.

Purematics â€“ Township Music. He Who Dares Wins CD, 4

Leseke la lahla, tshepo
Dintho di tla, loka

Close to a decade
I've nursed. This Cypherhead beat
Mixed emotions, I've had
Rap about ikasi or Hull City 

Then. It came to me
Rap about the Hood
The estates, the blocks
Imikhukhu and shanty towns

Kingston Alexandra
Mbare Njube Syria
Egypt Iraq

Siphi isagila sam'
Ngigcwalise isaka lam'
Sekaye selamu saka
Sekaye selamu

Sekaye selamu saka

Ketlatse mokotla, waka

Modemo, tlogela, setshaba
Sizwile, ubuhlungu
Igazi, licithekile
Imizi, itshabalele
USibongile, kasa, lali, ekhaya
Ubaba, kasela, umsebenzi
Umalume, ubotshiwe
Umfowethu, ubhubhulile
ENgilandi
Kawula, mali, yokuthumela
Isidumbu

Zimbi, indaba, madoda
Imbizo, ibiziwe
Iziphica, mfundo
Zimenyiwe, zifikile
Iyahluzwa, indaba

Leseke la Lahla tshepo
Dintho di tla, loka

The mass murderers
You`ve never heard of us
You've, never been ahead of us
Moving in silence
Fly on the wall

Click clack ni**as
Heartless streets
Served ya, to us

LeviTechStudios powers
For. My music
I bleed
My bars are forged

Fitted and cube rooted
V-rooted buck wild
Abwana Jinx engineer

So many Trojans
I fought off
To preserve the Album
Bootlegs

So. That means
You are the first
To put the last pieces
Of the Butjilo Igwendo
CD Album Saga

Rere completed
The story
Masimini and Levi
Witnessed it
Took a walk down to twins
Had a proper Yorkshire
Keep calm and carry on
Cuppa

I murder them beats
I crucify
And glorify
The streets

With, The Wingfield
Massive movement
We are at peace

Cooking. Phat hits in the kitchen

Love is spread: around
The, world
Through, music And theater
Actions speak louder
Than. Words

So put your hands. Together
Or put your hands
In the air
Like? U do not. Care

I have been lost for words
But, not speechless

I speedily steadily
I speedily
I speed up the flow

Now that we have arrived at the end
Of. Our journey
8 years it took to complete
This song

Then slow down the flow
Black chief Yes
Wase BYO

Peace is all we need

ONeLOVe. One movement
Bulawayo Gwanzura
Bangi phethe emoyeni
Sicela ukuthula

Sicela lehlise umoya
Sicela lithuthuke
Ngicela izenzo zami
Zayi zolo
Zingabi yinhlungu
Zaku, sasa

Ngicela, libambane, bantu
Ngicela, lixolelane

Lakhe, ndawonye

Izandla, emoyeni bandla
Leseke la lahla, tshepo
Dintho di tla, loka
Singa sebenza, sonke
Bandla
Ikusasa, izobanhle
Bandla

Omakhi, omakhelwane

Leseke La lahla tshepo
Dintho di tla, loka
Bakha ibandla
ONdlovu, oDube, oNcube
Sibambene, sindawonye
Bantu

Tshabangu, Butjilo, Igwendo
Mdongo good, looking out
Publisher extraordinaire
Look at us, now

Pure, music
Looks and books to match
I. Remember the first day
I lay eyes on you
When. I was with
My next ex boo

You Took my breath. Away
Even. My boy knows the score
What more. Can I say
Except that
You have inspired

This year
Zimbabwe hip-hop top ten, we chop it
You got to drop him

Zalabantu zebantwini
He, doesn't deserve
Your, love, trust and affection
Fatal. Attraction
I picture us running GTA6
Straight outta the hood
It's, all good
One date
One question

Music. Will you marry me

Not the last ex, but our lass
Funny, how time flies
And as time flies
I open my mouth wide
Like a crocodile
And catch, all the flies
No lies

No hard feelings
Cos truth be told
She was all good to Levi

Hush hush hush. My son
Go back to sleep
Daddy is tripping
All. This beverage
Has left me with no
Balance no leverage

Pure flip with script
Erase any others
Keep. Only the pure
So to all my ex's
I wish. U well

I bid. You farewell
Pure has finally met
The apple of his eye

I call her My Love
Code name for music
Hip-hop music
Live music from Bishops. Corner

You make a Rasta
 Wan na cut his dreadlocks
And get an Afro
UMbo murders. The flow

My Music was written in the garden of Eden
The biblical character
Turned, rapper

Curves cost money
So. Don'T be shy to chop, my money
Music makes me high
I'm High on music

Love songs. I don't write
But. If loving? U is wrong
I, don't wan na be right
I, have never deceived. Ya
Secret codes
In songs

Music, my love
Zimbabwe, my damsel in distress
The, lonesome dove
The only girl. I chased for ages

My music

Pure Music

What. More, can I say
I love. You music

I love. You Zimbabwe
I love. You music

I love! You Zimbabwe
I love. I love you. I love you

Music. You make me feel so high
Music if loving you

I, don't wan na be right
Music. If loving you
I, don't wan na be right

Purematics.
