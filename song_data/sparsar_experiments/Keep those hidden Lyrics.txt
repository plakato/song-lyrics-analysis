Keep those hidden Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Keep secrets hidden from nice views known as los silent kids silence is the.
key to the gold chain i wear keep on walking on the moon stars on my back stay.
shining my mind stays writen like books on paper i keep on burning the papers.
i smoke daily we slept on many to many thoughts who reads the words coming out.
my mouth no one over here take a swim in the coldest water thats icecold go to.
ct where the fire is burning on wood burnt both hands with with wood turnt it.
off with water.
