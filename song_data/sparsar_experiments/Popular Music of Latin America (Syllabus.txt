Popular Music of Latin America (Syllabus
by Russell Cobb.

_**Course Description and Objectives:**_.

This course will focus principally on popular forms of music traditionally.
associated with certain regions or countries. Among others, these will include.
corrido in Mexico, salsa and son in the Caribbean, samba and bossa nova in.
Brazil, tango in Argentina, as well as Latin American versions of rock and.
hip-hop, which have all travelled beyond the places where they originated..
While tracing their origin and development, they will be placed in the context.
of the cultures from which they emerged, with a view to understanding the.
meaning they have in that context, both as expressions of popular life and.
culture and as symbolic capital that has in some cases been appropriated by.
processes of commodification and the formation of national and regional.
identities.

The course is conducted in English. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is.
required. All readings will be in English and translations of song texts will.
be provided as required.

_**Objectives:**_.

• Develop a historical and theoretical knowledge of Latin American popular.
music.
• Improve critical thinking and writing skills.
• Develop a public research project that will annotate the lyrics to one.
significant artist or group in Latin American popular music, to be hosted on.
Rapgenius.com.
• Appreciate the wide variety of music in Latin America and its role in the.
region's history.

_**Texts:**_.

Found at http//albertamusica.wordpress.com/ This your space.
to reflect on readings and discussions. Entries should consist of 200-300.
words  commenting on an aspect of the class that you want to.
discuss in more depth. Writing here can be informal, but it must be original.
and must be focused on our topics. You might pose questions or venture some.
diverging opinions. Although you have a certain amount of freedom to post, you.
must post by the due dates listed in the daily work schedule. There will be no.
credit for posts after class time on the due date. There is zero tolerance for.
plagiarism here, as well as in the more formal writing assignments.

Individual Presentation.
Presentations will be given on a topic of interest by each student, for 15-20.
minutes. Each presentation will also include a 2 minute assessment  to be given to the rest of the class..
Presentations will be assessed based on content, organization, time.
management, and engagement with the audience. Students will choose one musical.
genre or movement from a list and present their findings on that topic on the.
day listed in the syllabus.

Class Participation : Students are expected to come to class with reading.
and listening done before class and to engage with lectures and discussions..
More than three unexcused absences will result in a 10% loss of the.
participation grade for each subsequent absence after three. Eating, texting,.
or emailing during class will automatically lower your participation grade.
10%. Class attendence is especially important to understand the music in its.
context. Students will evaluate themselves at the end of term. Participation.
will be evaluated holistically and based on class attendence, participation in.
group activities, and reaction on eClass forums.

Test #1  : This test will be held on Oct. 18 and will cover the first.
half of the content covered in the term. It will come straight from readings,.
screenings, and discussions. There will be short answers, no longer than a.
paragraph each.

Test #2  This test will be held on Nov. 27 and will cover the second half.
of the content covered in the term. It will come straight from readings,.
screenings, and discussions. There will be short answers, no longer than a.
paragraph each.

NON-CSL Students: Rap Genius Artist Annotation.

American artist or music group on the website Rap Genius, which is an open-.
source database of annotations of lyrics.

CSL students:.
