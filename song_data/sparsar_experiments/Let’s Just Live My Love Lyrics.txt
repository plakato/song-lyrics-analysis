Letâ€™s Just Live My Love Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

We've never seen.
The sky so clear before.
The grass is greener.
Than any other.
So here we are.
Just staring at the stars.
Let's be adventurous, let's be brave.
Let's not worry, we'll be save.
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake.
So here we are.
Just staring at the stars.
Let's be adventurous, let's be brave.
Let's not worry, we'll be save.
Let's just live my love.
Let's just live my love.
Let's just live.
Let's just live my love.
Let's just live my love.
Let's just live my love.
Whatever happens.
We'll just see.
Whatever happens.
We'll just see.
So here we are.
Just staring at the stars.
Let's be adventurous, let's be brave.
Let's not worry, we'll be save.
So here we are.
Just staring at the stars.
Let's be adventurous, let's be brave.
Let's not worry, we'll be save.
