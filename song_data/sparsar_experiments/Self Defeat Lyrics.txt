Self Defeat Lyrics
by Tyler James Williams.

One. Im tripping literally, I should be dish-washing.
Cause I got bowlegged knees and often they be crossing.
Go head and ask my bosses They'll tell you that Im clumsy.
I'll probably fall into your fist So you dont have to punch me.
Two. I'm Vegetarian So I don't want no beef.
You've Floss expensive Jewelry I Floss my crooked teeth.
I sing in church choir My daddy is a Reverend.
I tried to be a gansta But my curfew was eleven.
Three. I drive my Vespa through the streets and wear my helmet proud.
I do my homework every night Then come into this rowdy crowd.
I signed a full on battle, Filled in all the basics.
But when they saw it was me They put me on the waiting list.
Four. I run from bullies in the streets I don't know how to fight.
I don't throw lefts or rights I just slap, then sprint and write.
Im skinny all scrawny arms and a tiny chest.
Shoot I could hide behind that pole if i just hold my breath.
Five. My apron look like a drees.
I should twirl around like a pretty princess.
I'm not a busboy I'm a waitress.
But i can't get the drink's right, Taste Test.
Let me buy another round for all ya'll guests.
My hand's got sweaty and I lost my grip.
My shoes don't fit, They hand me down's.
From the salvation army right Down-Town.
When I walk into the room the lights go down.
Im so ugly mom won't hug me.
And that's ten better Disses than you.
I beat myself some-in you couldn't do.
