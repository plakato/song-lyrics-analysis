Infinite Regression Lyrics
by Quantic.

Here is the painting of a landscape.
But the artist who painted that picture says.
\- Something is missing. What is it?
It is I myself who was a part of the landscape I painted.
So he mentally takes a step backward.
\- or 'regresses' -- and paints....

...a picture of the artist painting.
A picture of the landscape.
And still something is missing. And that.
Something is still his real self.
Painting the second picture. So he.
'regresses' further and paints a third....

...a picture of the artist painting a.
Picture of the artist painting a.
Picture of the landscape. And because.
Something is still missing, he paints a.
Fourth and fifth picture....

...until there is a picture of.
The artist painting a picture of the.
Artist painting a picture of the.
Artist painting a picture of the.
Artist painting the landscape.

So infinite regression is--.

\--It is the moment when our artist.
Having regressed to the point of.
Infinity, himself becomes a part.
Of the picture he has painted and.
Is both the Observer and the observed.

Well, in that peculiar condition.
What would he be observing if he were observing.
Time?

He would perceive, Mr. Bonds, that Time is like.
A freeway with an infinite number of.
'lanes'.

\-- all leading from the past.
Into the future. But not into the.
Same future. A driver in Lane 'A'.
May crash, while a driver in Lane 'B'.
Survives. It follows that a driver.
By changing lanes, can change his.
Future.

Mr. Bonds, i think that time can.
Fully be understood by an observer.
With the Godlike gift of infinite.
Regression.

Do you believe that?

Absolutely! I think it is the only explanation.
