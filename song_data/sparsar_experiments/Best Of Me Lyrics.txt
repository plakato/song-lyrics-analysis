Best Of Me Lyrics
by Yuna.


I can see that lately, you've been struggling, 
I know that you've been de-motivated 
Saying, Sometimes things they just don't go your way and people gon na say
some things about you, 
 
When. You give everything you give everything up for nothing, 
You'll find when you give everything you give everything up for nothing. 
Just tell yourself that 
 
Yeah 
I'm not gon na. Let you get the best of me today. 
All these people tryna bring out the worst in me. 
Come, look at what you've created 
I'm better than what you've been saying: 
 
Cause. Once I was like you, the struggles that I've been through 
Cause once I was like you yeah, oh oh 
, 
I can see it now. The world is changing. People 
Hiding faces behind screens, 
Throwing criticisms. You don't need all that 
Just keep your head up. High, keep walking 
 
When, you give everything people hate to see that you're growing, you're
growing 
When, you know everything everything you've gone through is worth it 
And. You tell yourself that yeah 
 
I'm not gon na. Let you get the best of me today. 
All these people tryna bring out the worst in me. 
Come, look at what you've created 
I'm better than what you've been saying: 
 
Cause. Once I was like you, the struggles that I went through 
Cause once I was like you 
Do it all. Just like you, 
 
Come, and see what you've created, 
Come and see. If you like it, 
Challenge me and I might take it 
Take it take it. 
 
Yeah 
I'm not gon na. Let you get the best of me today. 
All these people tryna bring out the worst in me. 
Come, look at what you've created 
I'm better than what you've been saying: 
 
Cause. Once I was like you, the struggles that I went through 
Cause once I was like you
