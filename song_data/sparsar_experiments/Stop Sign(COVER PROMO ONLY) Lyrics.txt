Stop Sign(COVER PROMO ONLY) Lyrics
by YungKing.


Aaa.
Twerk some.
Shake some for a lil bit..
A.
STOP.Now make it pause like a stop sign..
Twerk some.
Shake some for a lil bit.
Stop. Now make it pause like a stop sign.

UH.
Got the fans pepped up like a rally.
Time to head out to the club.
Leave the kids with they daddy.
Get the Pinto, get the hoopie, bettah' hop inside a caddy.
If it got fours wheels then it better ride pass me.
Hat game tight,.
Shoe game tight Ya it's Yung King.
Im about to rip the mic.
Ya I stay ready to party You ain't even gotta ask me.
Make that that thang' drop like my ex left a$$ cheek.
Y-U-N-G-K-I-N-G why do you keep on hatin'?
Even when I fall Im get back up keep goin' like I'm skating.
Ya they waitin' on the mixtape but tell the truth.
That Sh#t ain't ready yet.
Hat on my head, tie in my back pocket.
Go ask them girls to.

Twerk some.
Shake some for a lil bit..
A.
STOP.
Now make it pause like a stop sign..
Twerk some.
Shake some for a lil bit.
Stop. Now make it pause like a stop sign.

Twerk some.
Shake some for a lil bit..
A.
STOP.
Now make it pause like a stop sign..
Twerk some.
Shake some for a lil bit.
Stop. Now make it pause like a stop sign.

Twerk some.
Shake some for a lil bit..
A.
STOP.
Now make it pause like a stop sign..
