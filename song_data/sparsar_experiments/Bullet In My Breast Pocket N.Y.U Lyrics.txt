Bullet In My Breast Pocket N.Y.U Lyrics
by Woody Allen.

**BULLET IN MY BEST POCKET**.

Years ago, my mother gave me a bullet...a bullet, and I put it in my breast.
pocket. Two years after that, I was walking down the street, when a berserk.
evangelist heaved a Gideon bible out a hotel room window, hitting me in the.
chest. Bible would have gone through my heart if it wasn't for the bullet.

**N.Y.U**.

I used to go to New York University a long time ago, which is in Greenwich.
Village, that's where I started, and I was, ah, in love in my freshman year,.
but I did not marry the first girl that I fell in love with, because there was.
a tremendous religious conflict, at the time. She was an atheist, and I was an.
agnostic, y'know. We didn't know which religion not to bring the children up.
in. And I bummed around for a long time, and I met my wife, and we got married.
against my parents' wishes, we were married in Long Island, in New York, we.
were married by a reformed rabbi in Long Island, a very reformed rabbi, a nazi.
It was a very nice affair, y'know, really good, and right after the wedding,.
my wife started turning weird. She went to Hunter College, and she got into.
the philosophy department at Hunter, and she started dressing with black.
clothes and no make-up, and leotards, y'know, and she pierced her ears one day.
with a conducters punch, y'know. And she used to involve me in deep.
philosophical arguments, and then prove I didn't exist, y'know...infuriating..
And I had to let her go, was what happened, and I had to tell my parents about.
it. And my parents are what you used to call 'old world'. My parents come from.
Brooklyn, which is the heart of the old world. They're very stable down-to-.
earth people, who, ah, don't approve of divorce. Their, their...their values.
in life are God and carpeting.

I came home on a sunday, this was a long time ago, my father's watching.
television sunday night, he's watching Ed Sullivan Show, on television, he's.
watching the Indiana Home for the Criminally Insane Glee Club on the Ed.
Sullivan Show. And my mother is in the corner, knitting a chicken, y'know. And.
I'd said that I would have to get a divorce, my mother put down her knitting,.
and she got up, and she went over to the furnace, and she opened the door, and.
she got in. Took it rather badly, I felt.
