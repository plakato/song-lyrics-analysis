Drive Thru Lyrics
by Quilly.

Can't buy my jacket cuz its 1 on 1.
She say that she lovin my style.

Trap house is open come Drive Thru.
Trap house is open come Drive Thru.
Half ass trappas.

Long as my money straight.
I got paper on paper my money not done.
I just fucked dem bitches then its one and done.
Im stackin that money at PAL.
Junkies at my door They just want some more.
She say that she lovin my style.
I got 500 pills.

Niggas at my door hit em wit the .4.
Im countin these 100s and throwin these 1s.
Weed Dope Crack.
Got a new house.
Gotcha bitch at the telly she ready to cum.
I dont need no friends.
Hammers in the ceiling Ounces on the floor.
Brought a new wheel.

I just talk face to face.
Wow! Wow!

Pour a lil liquor.
Im stackin that money at PAL.
I dont talk on the phone.
I got shooters on shooters so closet the gun.
Ima be here for a while.
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
Tone wassup wit em.
I just got a bag and it weigh a ton.
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
I beat my case at the trial.
Im just sellin weight.
Wow! Wow!
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
Trap house is open come Drive Thru.
Tired of these bitches.
You supposed to bring the family witcha.
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
I dont need no baggies.
I'on know niggas, Niggas know me.
Ima be here for a while.
I beat my case at the trial.
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
Tired of fuck niggas.
Razor blade or plate.
Cousin Got killed.
I do my dirt by my lonely, No Codeine.
Good bye Bottom, Never goin Back.
Whipping up the cakes.
I beat my case at the trial.
Wow! Wow!
They told me when you get rich.

Ima be here for a while.
Gotta get this money sick of being poor.
TRAP TRAP TRAP.
I just hit a lick I did that for fun.
Im stackin that money at PAL.
She say that she lovin my style.
Rest in Peace my nigga.
