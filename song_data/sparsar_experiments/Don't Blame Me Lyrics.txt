Don't Blame Me Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Leave you at the fast food forget to pay the pizza dude.
You always got to feed my dog.
I know it sounds crazy baby let me try maybe, maybe.
My memory gets fogged.
Well gimmie a chance we can go out to dance.
But before I go I should say.
I'm only a man, I'll do as much as I can.
I can't help it if I'm that way.

Don't blame me for something I can't change.
It's not my second nature to be good like you.
Let's walk around the problems that I've made.
Cause whatever happens you'll still, love me too.

Forget to pick the clothes up, accidentally break your cup.
Why stop I'm on a role.
I'm trying to do good get in a better mood.
Then we can really tear up the floor.
Well, things haven't changed, baby, I'm still the same.
I'm not perfect and you should be glad.
Take one look and listen to me play.
And you can see I'm not half bad.

Run around day and night barely never time to fight.
We're different from all the rest.
How do you do it, putting up with me.
Let me tell you baby you're the best.
Well, it makes no sense having us apart.
You'd have to see it or you'd be blind.
When we're together I'm so confused.
When we're apart your on my mind.

Let's take a break from our life all the pain all the strife.
It sounds too good to be true.
Living my life and singing my songs.

And yes, baby I've got you.
Well, playing six strings are my favorite things.
It keeps me up while I am down.
You got to believe me and you got to have faith.
You can't be snooping around.
