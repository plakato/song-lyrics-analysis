I Surrender Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

From the beginning you had me spinning in side.
You wanted romance i said ther eas no chance.
No matter how hard you trie.
D but as i lie awake at night and fantasize until the morning light.
I realize there is only one thing left to do.
I surrender to you.
I try to fight it but i saw your passion break thru.
I surrender to you.

When i first met you i tried not to let you get near.
I tried to resist but oo when you kissed me.
Imy body trembled with fear.
They way you touched me just blew my mind.
I held it back but now i think it's time.
To take the dreams i've been having and make them come true.
I try ti fight it but i'm hungry for love.
