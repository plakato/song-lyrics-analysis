Cloud Shadow on the Mountain Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

I was asleep in a hammock.
I was dreaming that I was a web.
I was a dreamcatcher hanging in the window of a minivan parked along the.
water's edge.
I'd say that I was all alone.
I'd say that I was all alone.
I'd say that I was all alone.
But I will never be born as a scorpion.

You're gonna be okay come morning.
Find your legs and find your horns.
Everybody gotta be reborn.
But I'll never be born as a scorpion.
Everybody gotta gotta be reborn.
But you will never be born as a scorpion.

You're gonna be okay come morning.
Find your legs and find your horns.
Cause you're not just another pair of boat shoes walking away from the harbor.

Cloud shadow on the mountain, cloud shadow on the plains.
Cloud shadow make an island nation on the fabric of this terrain.

You gotta jump, jump over the island like a gazelle.
You gotta jump over the island like a new long-legged gazelle.

But you will never be born as a scorpion.
Or just another pair of boat shows walking away from the harbor.
Just another pair of boat shows walking away from the harbor.

You're gonna be okay come morning.
Find your legs and find your horns.
Everybody gotta be reborn.
But you will never be born as a scorpion.
Everybody gotta gotta be reborn.
But you will never be born as a scorpion.
