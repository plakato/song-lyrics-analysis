Goodbye Lyrics
by Russ.

Goodbye, no use leading with our chins.
This is where our story ends.
Never lovers, ever friends!
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day.
But before you walk away.
I sincerely want to say.
Goodbye, bye.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, bye.
Goodbye!

You told me that I was crazy.
'Til I pulled up on your man and you.
You looked like the devil when you waved at me.
Bitch, I got something to say to you.
Goodbye, bye.
Goodbye!

Yeah, I cracked my windshield.
Lucky that I didn't crack you.
Bitch, you're a black hole.
Sucking me in your vacuum.
Yeah, I cracked my windshield.
Lucky that I didn't crack you.
And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying ask you.
Bout all of your past dudes.
And why they stay so present.
Cause bitch if im the future, then why they in yo presence.
And if I'm the king and you the queen.
Then why you acting like a peasant?
Why you acting like a peasant?
I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes.
Goodbye, bye.

Goodbye!

Let me start with Paul.
Have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens.
And your goats while you getting dogged.
Cause you think you love Paola.
Cause you went and fucked Paola.
But you're just enamored by pussy power.
Cause you never really got it.
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it.
And I knew it but I bought it.
And Paul's just your puppy.
Better keep him on your leash.
Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gonna leave.

But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!

Goodbye, bye.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon.
There was Igor, there was Paul.
Then I found out you're a prostitute.
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops!
Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus.
Man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you.
Oh, I, I really loved you.
But you're a money hungry ho.
Guess what I'm saying.

You told me that I was crazy.
'Til I pulled up on your man and you.
You looked like the devil when you waved at me.
Bitch, I got something to say to you.
Goodbye, bye.
Goodbye!

Goodbye!

Goodbye!

Goodbye.
