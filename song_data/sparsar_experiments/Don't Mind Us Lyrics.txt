Don't Mind Us Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

She's not nineteen, but she's got ID.
And she walks nicely, so she got by free.
She's on the guest list, blessed with huge breasts.
That protrude from her chest with a dude in a Lexus.

Who knew once she stepped in the club.
He'd be letting her hump.
Anybody that be getting her drunk.

Cause she gets free shots.
If the chick tease cocks.
And a 50-spot for the dick she'd suck.

The next day took her itchy muff.
To the clinic, pissin' samples into dixie cups.
And then she's off snorting on pixie dust.
Drinking back a mickey for a pick me up.

Just a club hopping slut talking obnoxiously.
Walking up Robson street on a drunk shopping spree.
Spending cash she made from ass she gave.
To whoever tapped it and paid without asking her age.

And these are some people that we don't like much.
Just a couple people that we don't like much.
Pet peeves get me vexed, please don't mind us.
We're just a couple MC's that don't like clubs.

These are some people that we don't like much.
Not you, just some people that we don't like much.
If you fit the description, well listen don't mind us.
Dance retardedly to R &amp; B and don't mind us.

Well, he's not quite cool, but he's got nice shoes.
Complete with buckles on 'em and he rocks nice jewels.
He's won the breast getters executed huge head trips.
Screwed unprotected a dude in a Lexus.

Who knew he would get in her pants so he's letting her dance.
With any guy that's directing her glass.
The pimp he's not with his limp greased cock.
But she thinks he's hot with the blinks he's got.

The next day to the gym he walks.
Notices his Jimmy smells like stinky socks.
Meanwhile, her ex-boyfriend on his dink sees spots.
Blisters on his c*ck the size of bindee dots.

An odd looking Todd booking out his doctor's door.
Walking across and sure that he can spot the whore.
Regretting cash he spent on flashy friends.
Trying to get her ass in a bend to follow fashion and trends.

And these are some people that we don't like much.
Just a couple people that we don't like much.
Pet peeves get me vexed, please don't mind us.
We're just a couple MC's that don't like clubs.

These are some people that we don't like much.
Not you, just some people that we don't like much.
If you fit this description, listen don't whine to us.
Dance retardedly to R &amp; B and don't mind us.

These are some people that we don't like much.
Not you, just some people that we don't like much.
Pet peeves get me vexed, please don't mind us.
We're just a couple MC's that don't like clubs.

These are some people that we don't like much.
Just a couple people that we don't like much.
If you fit this description, then listen don't whine to us.
Dance retardedly to R &amp; B and don't mind us.

These are some people that we don't like much.
Just a couple people that we don't like much.

Well I'm here with you guys today, to talk about a couple of things that have.
just been getting me so pissed off lately. I'm seeing people, and they're.
wearing orange pants, orange Abercrombie pants, and they have blond highlights.
in their hair with visor caps, and it's starting-a really get me vexed here..
If you, if y- if see you and you have a visor cap on and you got, and, and if.
it looks like you have about two bottles of gel in your hair, well I'm fuckin.
you up.  And if I might see you out on the street one day; I might be.
d- having some 93 ___ pizza down there on the... And, uh, you might walk my.
me... And if I see you with Tiva sandals and you're wearing socks, and you.
