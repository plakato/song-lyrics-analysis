Lost to the Wind Lyrics
by The Union.


Where do you go.
When you're here in the room.
But somewhere else inside, my dear?
I don't know.
The warm embrace of a young man that went to fire.
In the war, alone, long time ago.
Is there where you go?

And in the sea, lost to the wind.
A boat caught a drift on a strange sea within.

Dance on ice, summers that last still longer than today.
Through fields you used to run when you were young.

And in the sea, lost to the wind.
Wish I could reach her, she won't let me in.
And in the sea, lost to the wind.
To the wind.

And in the sea, lost to the wind.
A boat caught a drift on a strange sea within.
Wish I could reach her, she won't let me in.
And in the sea, lost to the wind.
The boat caught a drift on a strange sea within.
And in a sea, lost to the wind.
Lost to the wind.
