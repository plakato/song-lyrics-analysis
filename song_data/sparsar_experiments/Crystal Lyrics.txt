Crystal Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

Everything tonight.
Made everything alright.
I am speechless.
I listen to your words.
Float like hummingbirds all around me.

Sweet mess suspend me in crystal.

You and I were set.
To float down with a map.
See where it takes us.
I left you on that street with shadow at your feet.
I should've kissed you.

Sweet mess suspend me in crystal.
Sweet mess suspend me in crystal.
