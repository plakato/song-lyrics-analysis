Juice Part 2 Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Juice.
Yo it's really kinda funny MC Juice is my name.
I'm fin to kick some stuff about the phony rappers in the game.
I'm at the U.I.C. Pavillion wearing MC Juice medallions.
Brazilian or Sicilian rip apart they whole battalion.
These playalistic rappers fall prey to Juice the infamous.
Versace wearing niggas always trying to be some pimps in this biz.
And record labels sign the most unpresentable.
Clicks that go platinum for grabbin' on they genital.
And every single day why brothers die up in my mix.
All they ever rap about is Alize and fucking.
And I guess it really knows on the mic how I do it.
Everybody know I got the microphone in the fluid.
Brothers know on the mic I got the timin'.
You really think you're rhymin', cause Billboard charts say ya' climbin'.
I ain't saying no names, but why you biting his style?
Had these niggas laying in the casket with ya' Cristal.
And all the record buyers y'all be making music choices.
So why you be believing all these playalistic voices.
It's all the same the Big Willy wack the unoriginal.
Got the whole world like believing y'all some criminals.
Before them record deals they was broke and you can check it.
Cause true players don't be having no time for making records or no videos.
They to busy hustling in the zone.
And if you got so much loot, put out yo' records on yo' own.
And all this East vs. West rap mess need to stop.
Acting like some little shorties ain't nobody getting props.
Cause if you was, they wouldn't have to diss no other state no other crew.
No other click to put some food up on ya' plate.
I be like point blank this whole freakin' industry is wack.
But this brother from the Go gon' bring that lyricism back.
And a lot of y'all may not like the way I'm gettin' loose.
So whoever wanna battle bring that mess to the Juice.
Cause I rock the microphone and everybody know I battle right.
Watch me fly the mic and rip this mother via satellite.
Ain't no pimpin' me I freestyle and show no impathy.
Marley shoulda been the fifth nigga on the symphony.
Couldn't say the N word but I'ma have to spark it.
MC Juice is dope Monopoly let's free park it.
I'll go around the board on the mic I'm just advancin'.
In the game of Monopoly they don't got a chance in.
I es MC's who wanna be hard, rappers need a rap get out of jail free card.
And then when they done they be layin' in the middle.
I cook em' like a griddle, the Penguin and the Riddle.
I don't need to cuss get beheaded Nabisco cause brothers get shredded.
My Alzheimer's style you can't forget it.
But if ya' try then I'ma have to get fly and show ya' brothers who be.
Asking why I'm the number one guy.
So I could pass it to the right or to the left of me.
Cut off they ankles just in case they wanna step to me.
MC Juice ain't open to rebuttle who muttle.
Rappers fly up in the air but get blown up like the shuttle.
Cause I mack right, attract light like photosynthesis.
Rappers is wack as hell and I'ma put it in parenthesis.
No pause or comma, cause I'ma keep you fearin' this.
You gotta question mark I'm the nigga here period.
