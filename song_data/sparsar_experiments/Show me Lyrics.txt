Show me Lyrics
by Zinc.

When're you gonna show me?
When're you gonna show me?
When're you gonna show me?
How good it is with you.

When we gonna get it on?
When're you gonna show me.
How good it is with you.

When we gonna a get it off?
When're you gonna show me.
How good it is with you.

I want you so bad.
You make me feel so damn good.
I want you real bad.
Gotta have you.
I want you so bad.
You make me feel so damn good.
I want you real bad.
Gotta have you.

When're you gonna show me?
When're you gonna show me?
When're you gonna show me?

How good it is with you.
When we gonna get it on?
When're you gonna show me.
How good it is with you.

When we gonna get it off?
When're you gonna show me.

How good it is with you.
I want you so bad.
You make me feel so damn good.
I want you real bad.

Gotta have you.

I want you so bad.
You make me feel so damn good.
I want you real bad.
Gotta have you.

I want you so bad.
You make me feel so damn good.
I want you real bad.
Gotta have you.
