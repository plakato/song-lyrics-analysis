Blue Hotel Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

I'd like to say that I tried.
Fits in with all deceptions and lies.
And empty tables with food, untouched.
I couldn't see the future.
And I liked it too much.
I've been goin' from door to door.
With nothing to sell.
Wanderin' like a fool through the halls of a blue hotel.

Go on and rain down on us.
Go on and rain.
Go on and rain down on us.
I give up, I give up.

Somethin' about her is cold.
Blowin through the trees.
Leavin me wrong.
As the words come out.
I get confused, I get shattered like a lightbulb in October.
She's inside me like a secret.
And I got no one to tell.
And wanderin' like a fool through the halls of blue hotel.

Go on and rain down on us.
Go on and rain.
Go on and rain down on us.
I give up, I give up.

I give up, I give up.
