Gold Chain Lyrics
by Swazi Jive Entertainment.


I'mma make you one time.
You gon' want the all the time.
I be with my gold chain on, hanging at my neck.
I be with my gold chain on, banging on my chest.

Hold on wait niggas thought that I could rap.
Nigga minor detour got a job I'm really stackin'.
Nigga fucking with my chain on could stop the honest jackin' niggas.
Drop Lion Hearted Vol. 3, boy it's crunch time.
Graduated 2012 but I don't fuck with one time.
Homie cop the cannon, so we the knew drum line.
Your bitch said my cum whiter than a fucking coke line.
Slurp slurp whoe, babies on your tongue.
Fuck her with my chain on to show her I am not no bum.
Call her ? to show her I am not the one.
Stream AK iro 'mind that bitch where I'm fucking from.
No relation cause I ain't from nobody block.
Top and hands down don't make your fucking knees knock.
Take off my ? leave my name.
Boy still hot.
Cougar bitches trynna show me how they pussy pop.
And best believe I beat that pussy out the fucking frame.
She don't know my name, all she know is I fuck with my chain.
Drop this they gon' be like “who that nigga man?”.
Whoever he is that nigga 'bout to change the game.
Arizona Kings, Arizona Kings.
Team so cold I had to franchise our name.
Arizona Kings, Arizona Kings.
When I'm on I'mma cop another fucking gold chain.

Ooh I see that you covered some things, so unholy.
Ooh uncover yourself for the selfie.
Ooh I see you in love with the chain and the roly.
In love with the bank.
In love with the range.
Get back and we ?

Chain got me feeling like Django.
Middle finger to stranger.
I see some haters in the corner actin' like they be finna cause some danger.
Posing like some Power Rangers.
Fuck out of here.
Need something and Sakhile can arrange it.
He can get that for you.
Art Money Swazi Jive Enterainment.
Who else you know been putting out these records for you.
