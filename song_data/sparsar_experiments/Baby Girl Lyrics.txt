Baby Girl Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


You ain't nothing like my last chick.
Matter of fact you got me hoping this relationship can last.
Ask no questions cause I feel like I been granted my wish.
Been a long time since a brother felt like this.
I'm not going to the club tonight I'm staying home.
Me and my woman some Isley Brothers and sip this Patron.
My homies they be laughin at me telling me that I'm sprung.
But I'm in the zone when it comes to lil mama cause she the one.
What I really love about her she don't even need a man.
But she follow my lead and respect the fact I wear the pants.
And I got no problem hullin myself cause she my queen.
Half the time I spoil her half the time I'm tryin to get her out her jeans.
Z-ro still a gangsta he never been a romantic.
He spends most of his time with semi and fully automatics.
Although my baby been givin me reasons to leave the streets.
So instead of shootin up the block Imma take baby out to eat.

Cuz she my baby girl.
I'm used to the wrong woman.
Now I got my own woman.
She so good to me she gotta be my.
Baby girl.

No Longer do I have to search.
She a diamond she down to Earth.
Its Understood to me she gotta be mine.
Baby Girl.

And Everytime we sexing.
That hidden room is like a weapon.
Hey she gotta be mine.
Baby Girl.

More than anything she my friend.
It ain't all about the skins.
I don't ever want this to end.

She don't ever have to worry if I'm cheating.
I'm on the way home to give that bottom a beating.
Even though I'm what they call a rap singer.
Wit business to handle I got time to Carat my woman neck and her finger.
She there for me when life get hard for me.
And if i get busted she willing to take the charge for me.
But I can't see her wit handcuffs on for me.
Soon as they fingerprint.
She go be there wit my bond money.
Feelin like Martin Luther King Free at Last.
I hate you bitch is a thing of the past.
Not totally though I still got up a couple walls.
But on the other hand I be feeing for her phone calls.
And I'll be mad if I don't get it.
I ain't to gangsta to admit it.
So don't play wit me when I'm stressing.
I'll take yo shit and split it.
Hell naw she ain't no hoe She my old lady.
The one that's go gave 3 or4 of Z-ro's babies.

Baby girl.
I'm used to the wrong woman.
Now I got my own woman.
She so good to me she gotta be my.
Baby girl.

No Longer do I have to search.
She a diamond she down to Earth.
Its Understood to me she gotta be mine.
Baby Girl.

And Everytime we sexing.
That hidden room is like a weapon.
Hey she gotta be mine.
Baby Girl.

More than anything she my friend.
It ain't all about the skins.
I don't ever want this to end.

When I come home my bath water and my food ready.
And that lingere she be wearin be keeping the mood steady.
Lord Heaven must have got robbed cause an Angel is gone.
I'm guilty as charged Lord cause she all up in my home.

I'll say I do in sickness and in health for better or worse.
Imma still kick it wit all four homies alive.
When I'm not in Europe letting baby shop until she drop.
I'm the King and what good is a Queen if she can't rule wit ya.
Get out there like one of the homies and act a fool wit ya.
What's mine is hers she ain't gotta borrow nothing.
Watch I'll buy her a beauty shop and a foreign car or something.
And what's hers is mine. All I want is her heart.
And of Course that secret hidden treasure when her legs come apart.
And if I was to ever fall off my game she wouldn't leave me.
She'd help me get back on my feet and back on my CHANGE.

Baby girl.
I'm used to the wrong woman.
Now I got my own woman.
She so good to me she gotta be my.
Baby girl.

No Longer do I have to search.
She a diamond she down to Earth.
Its Understood to me she gotta be mine.
Baby Girl.

And Everytime we sexing.
That hidden room is like a weapon.
Hey she gotta be mine.
Baby Girl.

More than anything she my friend.
It ain't all about the skinsI don't ever want this to end.
