Swallow My Pride Lyrics
by Yung Redd.


N-D-T-P , nigga.
Get your money nigga, get your money nigga.
I'm just saying though, I'm still on the block man.
I'm trying to get mine, but I'ma tell y'all like a nigga told me man.
Get your money till you D-I-E man.

Yung Redd.
See I can't back my ways, partna not even if I tried.
Never swallow my pride, or keep my feelings inside.
There ain't nothing to hide, you can see it in my eyes.
A couple minor setbacks, still at least I tried.
For every nigga that died, for every mama that cried.
To every kid that heard a shot, scared to come outside.
Pay attention y'all, I'ma tell you like a nigga told me.
No matter what, get paper till you D-I-E nigga.
With all the shit that I been through, dead ends where I been to.
It's a couple of issues, I'd rather not get into.
Never thought I'd fill my vault, with just a paper and pencil.
You ain't gotta pay me back, for that money I sent ya.
Took mine, while the getting was good.
Feel like a prison, just to live in the hood.
If ya could ya would, find a way out never wear your days out.
And really I'm just trying to get paid, till I fade out.

Nine when I ride, high until I die.
Don't ask why, I just won't mind.
Rain sunshine, I'm on my grind.
Don't ask why, I'd never swallow my pride.
Yeah listen you'll never do me, and it's a million niggas in the street like.
me.
My eyes wired shut, you don't see what I see.
I've been hunting for weeks, ain't no time to sleep.
Still a nigga gotta eat, try to feel me.

Lil Ron.
Ask no questions, get told no lies.
That's why I blow the arm, when I'm rolling by.

I trust no one, to ride on the other side.
You gotta walk in my shoes, to see it like I see it.
If ain't no money being made, I ain't staying I'm leaving.
Not down, with betraying the fam' believe it.
I'm just relieving my mind, it's time for me to speak it.
It ain't a click of niggas, like the team I run with.
Bitches get y'all set up, cause y'all doing dumb shit.
Click-boom there go the tool, speaking to you fools.
He was innocent, but his man made too many moves.
Oh well, his chick like taking pictures nude.
Running through the crew, I ain't faking what you do.
I play photographer, and let her do what she do.
Run through the homies let her screw, she screwed.

Unique.
Collect the thoughts, from the back of my mind and then.
Reel 'em out, in the raps that I rhyme and then.
Resco', go package 'em down.
Hit the block grind 'em hard, like a package of dimes yeah.
I'm on my mash fa sho, I can't stall black.
You can call me what you want, cause I be all that.
Tickle this fo' nickel, and make you fall back.
You came all tough but nigga, had to crawl back.
I see facts, had the figga fa sho'.
Peep game peep lames, that these niggas is hoes.
Yeah it take work, just to get in the do'.
But why you faking and you shaking, I'll be getting this do' ay.

Scooby.
Some niggas, ain't acting the same mayn.
Grit bout to start, slapping you lames mayn.
Our money nigga, that ain't a game mayn.
You try to get us, we gon splatter your brains mayn.
And I'm harder, than any you artists.
I'ma be the nigga in the winter, that's getting it regardless you retarded.
And the meaning, we bringing it so important.
Of you thinking of intervening, believe that you a target yeah.
And I'm making it better, for niggas that's starving.
Trying to get they cheese up, we can't leave 'em back they need us.
Please brah, you ain't walked on my streets.
So how the fuck, you gon have the nuts to try me yeah.

Poppy.
See I am what I am, and it is what it is.
I've seen some shife shit, in the city I live.
Lil' kids man they out there bad, they out on the Ave.
With a mouth full of butter, chasing mountains of cash.
And on the other half, some cats is taking another path.
Struggling wondering, how long will the trouble last.
I'm trying to bubble past, what everyone expected fo' me.
Accept it homie, this the road God selected fo' me.
So don't question my motives, know that I'm focused.
Niggas is hating I'm hear em, and I know that they bogus.
But, I ain't gon let my boat pass me by.
So when I do what I do, don't ask my why.
