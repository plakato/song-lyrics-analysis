Hyrule Field Lyrics
by Yungtown.

Ever since I was little 
I wondered why 
I felt so different, 
 
These nightmares aren't 
Accustomed 
I must uncover this 
Vision 
 
We had adventures 
In, the Lost Woods 
You had claimed were sacred 
Even under Mido's enslavement. 
You said that I was your favorite 
 
But when that moment finally had arrived, 
The Kokiri Sword and the wooden shield 
That I had to buy 
 Can not protect me 
From. This feeling inside 
 
We'll miss a lot of years. 
Which isn't appealing to my 
Heart pieces, I'm seeking 
A freaking replacement 
Cause this stupid fairy Navi 
Doesn't, know what she is saying. 
 
Mido is psycho 
Blaming me for the 
Deku Tree's devastation 
 
It's difficult to leave you 
But. This emerald is complicated. 
Yeah kinda, like our friendship, 
And, it could possibly be us 
Together in the future. 
But hey thanks for this ocarina 
, 
See ya, 
 
I will remember all the times that we shared 
Times that we shared yeah 
I'll. Never forget you, though 
I must leave you right here. 
Leave you right here for that 
Hy-Hy-Hy that Hyrule Field 
That Hy-Hy-Hy, that Hyrule Field 
That Hy-Hy-Hy, that Hyrule Field 
It's the adventure of a lifetime, 
 
Now that I'm gone 
All these girls toy with my hearts, 
It's driving me Coo-coo 
That. I have to avoid all these guards 
 
So. Do I really have to listen. 
When Zelda is trippin 
About, her prophetic dreams, 
I mean we're only two adolescent, naive kids 
But a hero is what this legend needs. 
 
Impa teaches me this lullaby 
Though, the lyrics are unknown 
And afterwards, I must go 
Reclaim, two more spiritual stones 
When. I return 
We'll open this Door of Time, 
To protect what's most valuable 
Though. When I show up to see you 
You have to go 
 
Ganondorf. Now that I understand 
What, you are planning to do. 
Make the planet, yours 
Though, you'll, never manage 
For. I am challenging you, 
I might just be a child. 
But. Do not underestimate my courage, 
Time permitting
