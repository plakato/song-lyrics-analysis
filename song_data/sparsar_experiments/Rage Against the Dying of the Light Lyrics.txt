Rage Against the Dying of the Light Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

Before I die, take me to the place where we wrote our names wrong, but they.
shared a space.
Branches and leaves gathered between where you are right now and where I wanna.
be.
Between earth and sky, we'll build a fire so high they'll turn all the lights.
out.
And all will sing: I am alive, I deserve to be.
Not getting quiet, swallowing age.
But bless those sharp tears.
But rage and burn, and turn all those lights out before it gets warm.

Always compressing days.
Spending long out of time with no one else sorry for the outage.
Haven't you ever been set out and miscounted, frail and fully compromised?

Sharing a meal at a table your friends built.
We reach for the salt with our arms wet.
