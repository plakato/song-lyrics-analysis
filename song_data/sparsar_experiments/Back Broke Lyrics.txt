Back Broke Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Back broke and dancing.
Cause you're here beside me.
Cause you're here.
Cause you're here.
You're here with me.
Back broke and happy.
Cause you're near.
Cause you're near.
You're nearer to me.
I came on your command.
Don't give me false hope.
Back by big demand.
I'm back broke.
Don't give me false hope.
Back broke and smiling.
Cause it's clear.
Cause it's clear.
You still want me.
I came on your command.
Don't give us false hope.
Back by big demand.
Don't give us false hope.
Back broke and crying.
Well pardon....
