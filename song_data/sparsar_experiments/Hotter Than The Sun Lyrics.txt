Hotter Than The Sun Lyrics
by Z-Mane.


Ha, you wanna know something funny?
Just two years ago, I was over singing that I'm so cold.
You know, and I still do say that.
But right now....I'm a turn the other knob on.

Lil Wayne sample from Mr. Carter.
Man, I got summer hating on me cause I'm hotter than the sun.
Hot-hotter than the sun, hot-hotter than the sun.

Okay, I got summer hating on me cause I'm hotter than the sun be.
Temperature a hundred, got them sweating like their running.
But all they do is run their mouth, I don't care what they're talking about.
Claiming that they stay on top, well let me bring them back down South.
Haters gonna hate, yep, Henry couldn't have said it better.
If they think they're fly like paper, let me put them in a shredder.
Make them deader than a door nail, oh well, bring them more hell.
I'll show these niggas, no tell, just worry about your flow sales.
Man, it's getting hot, these niggas starting to feel the flame.
No Phillip, now gon' feel up on this knowledge to your bain.
I hope it don't melt away cause it's looking like summer days.
And these niggas are looking lost cause I got them trapped in amazing.
Summer's hating on me, winter's looking lonely.
She ice cold, I'm too hot, but she's my one and only.
I never fall and I'm never sprung, never that.
Summer time shining as I'm riding in my Cadillac.

Hold up, wait a minute, what's that noise? Man, that's sounding like the cops.
Naw it's just the firefighters, they running up and down the block.
It's so hot that when I step outside, I nearly combust.
But you'll never water me down, mane, I'll nearly destruct.
They say the game need change but it really need a miracle.
These niggas acting like slaves, they might as well sing some spirituals.
Like holy cow, he's slowing down, but if I speed it up, then they get shut.
down.
I spit that fire, nigga, better retire, looking down at you niggas like yeah,.
what now?
I'm from the town where they're representing the Wolves.
My team must be Matadores because them other teams be on that bull.
Well tell them ole and watch us bring the heat.
Got the crowd up on they feet, it's so intense, it's burning up their seat.
Even in the winter time, I be chilling on a beach.
With a country girl so sweet, I call her my Georgia peach.
But she ain't from the A-Town, naw, baby from the O.
Hometown grown, she set a fire to my soul.

Okay, I got the Eskimos sweating up in their igloo.
I'll light a fire on these niggas, I'll call them my Kindle.
They say that I'm the new fire man, but I'm a leave that to Wayne.
Me and Pac both told you niggas that we had so much pain.
I'm tired of these lames saying that they're too hot.
Because to tell the truth, my nigga, um, yeah, you're really not.
They used to see Z-Mane say he was so cold.
But he came back to bring that fire to you niggas' soul.
Like whoa, I'm about to be gone like I said on that Royal City.
I see these niggas and I burn them up, there's no pity.
And then I'm outtie 5000, or should I say 3?
What up to Andre? These niggas' lames, can't be like me.

I'm too hot, I'm so cold.
Never really warm but I got so much soul.
Like Aretha, just can't beat me, bruh.
Don't make me get to swinging on you like Derek Jeter.
It's R.G.O.D. until the day I go.
I rep for Trotman City, too, but you already know.
What up to Lil Weezy? Yeah, you know what it is.
I'm hotter than the sun, you can't get like this.
