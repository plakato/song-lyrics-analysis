In the Morning When I Rise Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

In the morning when I rise / In the morning when I rise.
In the morning when I rise / Give me Jesus.

Give me Jesus / Give me Jesus.
You can have all this world / But give me Jesus.

And when I am alone / Oh, when I am alone.
And when I am alone / Give me Jesus.

Give me Jesus / Give me Jesus.

You can have all this world / But give me Jesus.

And when I come to die / Oh, when I come to die.
And when I come to die / Give me Jesus.

Give me Jesus / Give me Jesus.
You can have all this world / But give me Jesus.
