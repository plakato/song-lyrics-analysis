XL Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

Yeah.. yeah...
Ladies and gentlemen ..may I present.
Yeah...

Four of New York's finest...
Give it up for the X-Ecutioners!

Large Professor.
Yo.
I'm like a country wild western, rhyme style murderer.
X-Ecutioners, cuttin things you never heard of.
Flip new beats, never once flipped a burger.
But I flame-broil, and still remain loyal.
On the hip-hop throne, and most kings I been doin it.
Rock, Rob, Joe, and Big E is one unit.
Supreme force, ever since Main Source, my nigga.
Shoulda had yo ass drunk like liqour, in a stuper.
Got to stay super, with the Cash Flow.
Never bashful, here's what you asked fo'.
The best DJ's in the world today.
Cuttin up Rock the Bells LL Cool J.
And many more, Robbie Swift and he raw.
Roc Raida, number one chop innovator.
Total Eclipse, man you know that he flips.
And he diminished the, record like my man Joe Sinister.
I'mma lay back and watch 'em bless the track.
For the hip-hop world, cuz these brothers don't slack.
They always comin with the up-to-par.
You can call X-Ecutioners the best by far....

Knowhatmsayin? Yeah...
Knowhatmsayin? Word up...
Yeah....

Large Professor.
Yo, I take you back to the cave man era.
Survival and how to live, on ways I get better.
I'm too deep to peek, rock niggas to sleep.
I'm like a four star general, out in the street.
Keep my business low, represent Cash Flow.
Bustin loose like Chuck Brown to get that dough.
Most of y'all could tell, I come from the ghetto.
Eight blocks from flushin metal where my family settle.
Got Chinese, Korean, Asian.
Used to link up with Nas, from Corntop Choice, for female persuasion.
Bustin off in the park, that was in the dark.
I'm real not fake so please don't pretend to part.
I'm lettin it start, the glamour the bucks.
Gotta get mine, cuz beef got stamina and guts.
Plus the phat beat, plus the rhyme plus the cuts.

Cutting up cut in background.

Large P talking.
Yeah, X-Ecutioners rockin the track.
Comin through with the hefty scratch.
Cuts galore...
Boardin back and forth.. all over the world.
Tri-state, every five borough.
Word up, these brothers been doin this for a minute.
Man, gettin busy man, just.. cuttin 'em up man.
Choppin 'em, slicin 'em.
That's the original essence of hip-hop, knowhatmsayin.
Just niggas just gettin busy and shit.
Two turntables that's how it started.
Two turntables and a microphone.
X-Ecutioners, keepin the foundation strong....
