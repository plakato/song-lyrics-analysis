.
Left hand on that wood grain, I'm passing the dutch with my right hand.
I cruise with the devil, my shoes on the pedal, them bitches imported from.
Thailand nigga.
What a nightmare nigga. Yeah I been real since high chairs nigga.
If I could pay my flight fare you almost guarantee that I would not be right.
here nigga.
Best believe that, hunger in my eyes you can see that.
Girl can't you see we're tryna relax? Put your feet up, put your seat back.
My nigga 'bout to bust out the weed bags, Cheif that, we blowing that.
Cease to her knees she's blowing that, I can see your Love Pink, she throw it.
back, with your.
Hoeing ass. You ain't notice that niggas in the streets taking shells to the.
face.
I'm out here tryna win taking L's to the face. We could prolly fall in love if.
it fell into place.
Thats that real life shit. You know the flow to make them niggas feel.

Let me get a deal right quick. Want to know what Heavens like? Get a feel.
right quick.
Rocking shows, I rock the boat, throw your clothes all on the floor.
Got my name across her toes, I could be your pot of gold.
Best believe that, if you let a nigga in between that.
Girl can't you see I'm tryna beat that, put your feet up, put your knees back.

Aaliyah - Rock The Boat.
Boy you know you make me float.
Boy you really get me high.
I feel like I'm on dope.
Cause you, you serve me on a regular.
Boy we need to tie this rope.
Before we drift any deeper.
There now hold me close.
Boy let's take this overboard now.
I want you to rock the boat.
Rock the boat.
Rock the boat, rock the boat.
Work the middle, work the middle.
Work the middle.
Change positions, new positions.
New positions, new positions.
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me.
Stroke it for me.
Ooh baby I love your stroke.
Cause you, cause you get me to where I'm going.
In a jury you'll get my vote.
Cause I believe.
I believe you know just what you doing now.
Baby now we can coast.
Just don't get in a hurry.
That's too slow.
Go ahead and put that thing in over drive.
I want you to rock the boat.
Rock the boat.
Rock the boat, rock the boat.
Work the middle, work the middle.
Work the middle.
Change positions, new positions.
New positions, new positions.
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me.
Stroke it for me.
I want you to rock the boat.
Rock the boat.
Rock the boat, rock the boat.
Work the middle, work the middle.
Work the middle.
Change positions, new positions.
New positions, new positions.
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me.
Stroke it for me.
Stroke it for me.
Stroke it baby, Stroke it baby.
Mmmm, Work it baby, Work it baby.
Oooh Stroke It.
There is somethin' I want you to do.
I need you to use yourself.
Like you never ever used to do before.
To explore my body.
Until you reach the shore.
You'll be calling, calling for more.
Rock the boat.
Rock the boat.
Rock the boat, rock the boat.
Work the middle, work the middle.
Work the middle.
Change positions, new positions.
New positions, new positions.
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me.
Stroke it for me.
Rock the boat.
Rock the boat.
Rock the boat.

Its been 9 months and 10 days.
On the 11th of every month we celebrate.
I met you back in the 12th grade.
But nowadays I'm really starting to develop hate.
You have me walking around like an emotional blur.
Choking on that potent everytime I be toking that herb.
Lying by the ocean with her.
Applying lotion to her, I guess thats no notion to her.
That I'm in it, until my life is finished.
And I be missing those times when we rode bikes to picnics.
And I admit it now I'm living on the edge.
And ain't beating around the bush, I'm just trimming off the hedge.
No sugar coating, cuz I'm not cooking nothing.
And please don't look for something in me, I'm a good for nothing.
A little hoodlum running on no sleep.
You might have got hot headed but I never got cold feet she said.

Boy you know you make me float.
Boy you really get me high.
I feel like I'm on dope.
Cause you, you serve me on a regular.

Its been 9 months and 10 days.
On the 11th of every month we celebrate.
I met you back in the 12th grade.
But nowadays I'm really starting to develop hate.
You have me rolling over in my sleep thinking bout you.
Something so unique about you. My knees weak around you.
I couldn't survive a week without you. Let alone a day.
But I'm left alone today.
I'm tryna see eternity.
Chip on your shoulder I told you thats where your purse should be.
But on the floor is where your shirt should be.
Dont take it personally cuz we're certain to be together.
Forever. Imma tourist in this world.
Can I have a flourist for my girl?.
So she can have all the flowers she likes.
Yeah all the flower she likes.

Boycott.

Aaliyah.
Yeah.
