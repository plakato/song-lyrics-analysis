Homebuilder Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

Out in the back, looking up at stars.
Talking about stuff much bigger than ourselves.
Thanks for being Dad whose bags aren't packed, waiting by the door.
Looking for the perfect time to go, like I've seen in so many other homes.
I've come to believe you breed more like yourself. As you put me to bed.
I wouldn't just sleep, I'd dream to be half the man I saw you to be.
I'm proud to be your boy. I love I bring you joy.
And I'm honored one day, I get to do the same and pass on our last name.
I'm proud to be your boy. I love I bring you joy.
All roads lead to roaming.
But I never would have grown if I never left home.
300 miles is nothing too far. In my life you're that guiding North Star.
You're here when I look in the mirror.
Everything you give for this family. Your wife and us three.
You live and you love true.
I can be just like you, cause father you used to be just like me.
