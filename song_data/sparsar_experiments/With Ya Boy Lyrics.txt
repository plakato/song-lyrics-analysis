With Ya Boy Lyrics
by Qon Vince.


I'M on Zone number four
Who's funny
They is funny
But. Lately, I'm what they hating on

Lj with a fat sack
Fuck figures wan na pack
But no sell just Mack
On the cell dreamin in a Cadillac
Smoke some trees with ya boy
Riding in my caddillac
Smoke some trees with ya boy
Riding. In my Cadillac

In. The clouds making my block hot
Most crowds wan na knock pot
But, I'm Swagging out, I'm geeking
Drag in mouth, I'm wreaking
Long, rips, plus acid trips
I, kissed Mary. She bit my lips
Im just smoking given tips
Get this money then get the tits
Got your girl sassy catch, no mits
See! You are in the midst
Of, both sides, quick, leopard prints
Of a presents like a mist
I, keep a cannibis cup to twist
I put in order list
The easyness till I got ta toughen fist
Not selling G's, but they don't get the gist
My mind yelling jeez
As. I wake an bake Sipping on a Sunkist

Shout to Rich Boy

I'm, not just tryna, soda pop
I hope my mixtape more than sorta drop
I need 
Datpiff crashin. I need this laughin an smashin
While. The beat drops stash out to stash in
Break it down an get to passin
Want to get to where we all eat no fastin
Im livin life on the fast end
Mixin hashes passin out with my best friend
They say they cruising out. Well, I'm cruisin on the best bend
Blunts used to be bananas, now thats, how my life goes
Im flyin over Kansas tappin, my toes
Im, the wizard of the Oz
The slizzared to the flows
My reef. You doze My keef, it slows
My need. It grows This seed of lows
On, the come up
The sun to the sun, up
The sewn to the done up
The to blown to the torn up
Im a lot of things, but this is something needed
All. These flings compiled still just weeded
Like. If I was any higher, would there be a point
So? I hit it till its ironic, like how I kill this joint
