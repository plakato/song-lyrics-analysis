Cue The Rain Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.

You know it's over but you don't wanna say.
You see the writin' on the wall but you don't wanna read.
And now you're hopin' that there'll be somethin' different.
Somethin' to change the circumstances of the way you're livin'.

But that's that fantasy, that's that reality.
The one you love that keeps on changin' personalities.
It's always jealousy, too much intensity.
I don't remember signin' over my I, identity.

Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy.
Baby, you got my heart in chains.
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light.
On this site, somebody cue the rain.

Cue the rain, cue the rain.
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain.
Didn't know you'd be so greedy.
Baby, you got my heart in chains.

Now you met me on the fly, I was flyin' so high.
You said I can fly too, that's the start of me and you.
Chemistry, what a blast, had us movin' so fast.
Ooh baby, what a ride when your love is the map.
Let's go.

Love the way I move in, the crowd still a jewel.
I rule it all with these cause I got that joie de vive.
But like Tinker bell in the story of Pan.

But I want free love.

Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy.
Baby, you got my heart in chains.
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light.
On this site, somebody cue the rain.

Cue the rain, cue the rain.
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain.
Didn't know you'd be so greedy.
Baby, you got my heart in chains.

If you don't love me now, you will never love me again.
I can still hear you say you will never, never break.
Never break the chains.

Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy.
Baby, you got my heart in chains.
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light.
On this site, somebody cue the rain.

Cue the rain, cue the rain.
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain.
Didn't know you'd be so greedy.
Baby, you got my heart in chains.

When it comes close your eyes, I'm takin' over your body.
Close your eyes, close your eyes.
When it comes I know cause I, I release myself.
Incomprehensible inside, close your eyes.

Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy.
Baby, you got my heart in chains.
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light.
On this site, somebody cue the rain.

Cue the rain, cue the rain.
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain.
Didn't know you'd be so greedy.
Baby, you got my heart in chains.
