Astral Projection Lyrics

Astral Projection.
Produced By Vo-Kal.

You don't.
Look at me like you used to.
And I.
Still remember what you used to say.
But now.
There is this distance between us.
Could you.
Just tell me that you love me.
And.

Can you.
Take me.
Away from.
Everything in my life.
Cause I fucked up on my last one.
All I want is.
You to.
Take me.
Away from.
Everything in my life.
Paralyzed by the pain of my soul.
And yearning for your hold.

Looking at the carpet.
From ground level again.
Still picking up the pieces.
From that last bitch's sins.
No excuses being made.
For the money that I spent.
But I just want some reimbursement.
For all the time that I lent.
Spending less time at home now.
More time with my friends that.
So called know me well.
But yet they ain't giving me no spins.
Getting drunk on the weekend.
Is some shit that I miss.
But if you only know me intoxicated.
Then please don't say shit.
No new friends.
No new women.
Not my choice.
It's new living.
Cause deep down.
I'm pretentious.
And I'm ok with.
Not having fucks to give.
But maybe.
I'm lonely.
And I'm still scared.
That little boy.
That loves to stay up.
And watch anime.
And fall asleep with his sonic toys.
I wasn't popular in school.
But I've blown up since graduation.
And now my heads gotten kinda big.
Wish I had grown up from graduation.
But I barely passed.
And they almost laughed.
Know they still will.
With no hesitation.
I'm a product of my environment.
Just guilty by association.

My third eye is calcified.
Lusting over a fat ass.
Love life is Ned's Declassified.
Are you satisfied.
Like I'm really gonna change now.
The crazy thing is.
I've been the same.
Took a strangers words.
To reveal the shade.
Took the bitter truth.
To reveal my shame.
My character is in jeopardy.
My intentions and.
My expectations.
Are the only true things to carry me.
I mean damn.
Tell me what would my grandma think.
If I told her I was strip clubs.
Cause Drake made it cool to show strippers love.
So made it rain.
But that's not the answer.
I use lust as a cover up.
I'm scared commitment won't work out.
I'm scared my talent will ruin us.
I'm scared that every bad bitch.
That wants to make a name.
Will come after me.
And throw that pussy oh so well.
And I lose it all.
And I won't sell.
Cause I can't relate to myself no more.
I see myself and I can't ignore.
The blind truth.
Cause I'm blinded to.
Reality.
I'm falling through.
They trapped us all.
They trapped us all.
Don't want to lose myself cause they can't break us.
Sewn inside of a walrus suit.
I just don't want to become Wallace from Tusk.

Austyn, Stephanie.
Ellen, Erin.
Gabriela, Emily.
Courtney, and Amanda.
I used to could barely stand you.
I had a simple crush.
With a little lust.
A little trust.
That we could be.
But I ain't enough.
Or at least I wasn't.
I seen it coming.
It was something I grew to expect.
I wasn't your type and you weren't mine.
You were so fine.
Blind to the fact.
That you helped me grow.
Heartbreak is so.
Freeing and so natural.
It took me years to appreciate.
All the pain you brought and didn't know.
I don't blame you.
I respect you now.
And for all the guys that you've turned down.
It was meant to be for self growth.
Self expression.
Where the hell would I be without those lessons.
So God put music inside my soul.
To heal my heart.
To help me know.
To help show me.
That I don't need help.
Or confirmation.
That I'm just me.
Still underground so sleep on me.
I can believe in myself.
Without hypnosis.
I'm Spider-Man fresh out the black suit.
My detractors and I have a symbiosis.
I've grown a little.
I experienced things.
Learned to create.
I've learned how to sing.
My psychosis might be to change the world.
But now my passion has become my neurosis.
