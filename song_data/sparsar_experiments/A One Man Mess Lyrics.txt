A One Man Mess Lyrics
by Two Crown King.


The first steps you know. The rest – guess you don't.
Possessed? Yes or no? Obsessed? Yes and no.
I'm blessed; destined, woah. My jet's set to go.
Heart beating so bad that my chest lets it go.
Wait a minute. Turn the time back; rewind.
I'm weak in my knees, and I'm sick in my mind.
Caught up in the act, confused by the chaos.
I need to find an answer, but I'm waiting for the pay off.
Weak, sick, under the weather, and not feeling right.
Ill, feeling sick. Still sick feeling I'm a like -.
\- a one man mess. One man army.
With my weakness exposed, and you know so you harm me.
So quick to disarm me; I'm left weaponless.
Next step in this {game}, is to make you feel the {same}.
Weak knees. Now please speak. Now what's the remedy.
I think you would ???, cause only you can better me.

Refrain.
You – you – you should know me by now.
I'm a fool – fool – fool, and I just can't seem to help myself, no.

Now I smile when you smile. I admit it - I'm addicted.
Call me blessed. Yes, I confess; I'm afflicted.
But this is what a chip did. I want to know why.
Better go. Yeah, yeah. Bye bye.
See, now I'm down to one. This crown's down. I'm done.
My power's lost all of its fun. And yet I keep speaking out, -.
\- and you keep freaking out. This is killing us.
But even though we say that it's gone, I know it's still in us.

Refrain.

I'm afraid I might be a lost ship on your sea.
Every time that you speak I get weak.
{I get weak}.
No mistake how I break. Only so much I can take.
From the top of my soul to my feet, I get weak.
{I get weak}.

Even though we say that it's gone I know it's still in us.
Even though we say that it's gone I know it's still in us.
Even though we say that it's gone I know it's still in us.
Even though we say that it's gone I know it's still in us.
{I get weak}.

I'm afraid I might be a lost ship on your sea.
Every time that you speak I get weak.
{I get weak}.
No mistake how I break. Only so much I can take.
You can ask. Hold my knees. I get weak.
{I get weak}.
Like a dog on your street, hungry, begging for a treat.
Late at night watch you sleep. I get weak.
{I get weak}.
And you ?? to blame, and I'll never be the same.
From the top of my soul to my feet. I get weak.
{I get weak}.
