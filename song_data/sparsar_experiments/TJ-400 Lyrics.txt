TJ-400 Lyrics
by 420Chainz.


We in this thing like it's eighteen-double-o.
Hamilton playin' second fiddle to the commander n' chief.
Thomas J.

Yeah my bars are dope.
Just read the declaration.
Without my penmanship.
America's not a nation.
Rep' the constitution.
A-H just assumin'.
Federalism may be boomin'.
But against me its just losin'.

Never strike out when I'm baton rouge.
15 million dollars to act a fool.
I ain't the bus driver I get to school.
So much money on me.
Its hard to lose.
Swerve.

Staying mad fresh.
Yeah I got a stack.
But the farmers need it.
So I give it back.

Third president.
On that number 2.
Call that triple double.
Shouts out to Ice Cube.

Never strike out when I'm baton rouge.
15 million dollars to act a fool.
I ain't the bus driver but I get to school.
So much money on me.
Its hard to lose.
Swerve.

I'm a two-squared father.
I ain't never been a square.
Hit my buddy Adams up.
I'm a revolutionaire.
Midnight sunrise.
I don't need to wear shades.
Chillin' with my brothers.
All kinds of escapades.

Kanye point, I made it.
No new slaves, I state it.
Tariffs, I just hate it.
And these seeds, I just laid it.

Made my own mansion.
Southern V.A.
Alienation and sedition.
You can't tell me what to say.

Never strike out when I'm baton rouge.
15 million dollars to act a fool.
I ain't the bus driver but I get to school.
So much money on me.
Its hard to lose.

Cold as Hamilton.
Just ask Aaron burr.
Everywhere I go.
Got that fox that mink that fur.
If you in my way.
Bitch you better swerve.
