She's Out There Lyrics
by Rushlow.

She's out there.
Callin' somebody baby.
Drivin' somebody crazy.
Breakin' hearts just like mine.

She's out there.
Lookin' just like an angel.
Flirtin' across the table.
Drinkin' somebody's wine.

She's out there somewhere.
Dancin' around the moon.
Yeah, the laughter we shared.
Ended way too soon.
But when I close my eyes.
I know deep inside.

She's out there.
Tellin' somebody's secrets.
Makin' somebody feel it.
Changin' somebody's life.

She's out there somewhere.
Dancin' around the moon.
Yeah, the laughter we shared.
Ended way too soon.
But when I close my eyes.
I know deep inside.

She's out there.
She's out there somewhere.
Dancin' around the moon.
Yeah, the laughter we shared.
Ended way too soon.

She's out there somewhere.
Dancin' around the moon.
Yeah, the laughter we shared.
Ended way too soon.
But when I close my eyes.
I know deep inside.

Yeah, she's out there.
Yeah, she's out there.
Yeah, she's out there.
Yeah she's out there.
