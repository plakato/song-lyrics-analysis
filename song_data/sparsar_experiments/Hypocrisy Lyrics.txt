Hypocrisy Lyrics
by Sworn In.

2x.
This is hypocrisy.
Practice what you preach.
Practice what you preach.

Fuck you.
You're meaningless to me.
You're everything.
You told me never to be.

Sick and twisted, fucked up and ruthless.
Deranged at worst and at very best useless.

2x.
Save it for hell's gate.
Save it for the fucking treason parade.

I watched my world burn 5x.
As you watched with a grin.
From the point of no return.
Once again, yeah, once again.
This sympathy symphony never seems to end.

No trust, no, there's no fucking trust.
All I've learned is fucked I'll never adjust.
Nothing you'll ever do will make this just.
Disgust, disgust, disgust.

Keep burning, ashes to dust.
There never was any trust.
Laid to rest, dead in the mind.
Completely blind, completely blind.

Fuel the fire, burn to the ground.
And don't you even dare try to fucking turn this around.
Cause nothing's left but this silent grin.
You will never win.

I watched my world burn.
As you watched with a grin.
From the point of no return.
Once again, yeah, once again.
This sympathy symphony never seems to end.

2x.
Not like you said.
You were not just friends.

So take your necklace off and put a fucking noose in its place.

Fuck!

2x.
So sing along with me.
You'll burn in hell with no sympathy.

2x.
This is hypocrisy.
Practice what you fucking preach.
Practice what you preach.
Nothing but a useless leech.
Sucking the world dry with everything you teach.
