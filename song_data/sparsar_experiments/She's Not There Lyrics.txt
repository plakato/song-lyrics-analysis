She's Not There Lyrics
by The Zombies.

Well no one told me about her.
The way she lied.
Well no one told me about her.
How many people cried.

But it's too late to say you're sorry.
How would I know why should I care.
Please don't bother trying to find her.
She's not there.

Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked.
The way she'd act and the color of her hair.
Her voice was soft and cool.
Her eyes were clear and bright.
But she's not there.

Well no one told me about her.
What could I do.
Well no one told me about her.
Though they all knew.

But it's too late to say you're sorry.
How would I know, why should I care.
Please don't bother trying to find her.
She's not there.

Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked.
The way she'd act and the.
color of her hair.
Her voice was soft and cool.
Her eyes were clear and bright.
But she's not there.

But it's too late to say you're sorry.
How would I know, why should I care.
Please don't bother trying to find her.
She's not there.

Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked.
The way she'd act and the.
color of her hair.
Her voice was soft and cool.
Her eyes were clear and bright.
But she's not there.
