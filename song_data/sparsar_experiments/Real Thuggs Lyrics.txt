Real Thuggs Lyrics
by 50/50 Twin.


50/50 Lil' Twin, I'm in here with Slim Thugger the Boss.
And the cocky copy machine King Koopa.
We off this Nawfside of Houston.
We just wanna put it down for all the thugsters.
And the gangstas naw I mean, dig these blues cutty what.

Slim Thug.
Slim and 50 gon drop classics, to the day they drop our caskets.
Some folks got that magic, and us three have it.
Dropping hits our fans blasting, over a million cashing.
Five years I'm still lasting, foot to the flo' I'm mashing.
Guarding traffic not crashing, controlling the wheel.
Independent holding a mill, without a holding a deal.
50/50, Slim and Chamill, getting it grown man style.
Our pockets to y'all pockets, like a man and a child.
Paid In Full and Boss Hogg, stay controlling the crowd.
You know the click you hear the speakers, and cars banging loud.
You know the click that represent, and have H-Town proud.
You know the click that live they life, like outlaws.
We the untouchable two, it ain't much we don't do.
If you try to touch our crew, well reach out and touch you.
fill you with slugs, for grilling us with your mugs.
Make doctors fill you with plugs, you dealing with thugs.

If you ain't no real thug, go ahead give it up.
If you are a real thug, where your sets put 'em up.
Your life seem full of hard times, really rough.
Put the sad songs to the side, grind and get bucks.
Don't eat with your eyes, stack cash then stunt.
Dump your problems in the ash tray, fire up you some'ing.
Why try to play catch up, breathe easy stay humble.
Cutty your time is coming, are you hungry do you want it.

50/50 Twin.
I get down on the dice like what, better set of thugs.
Put some 20's on my mama car, let her Perelli's run.
50/50 slumped down, in a awkward machine.
Four screens six 15's, don't look directly at my ring.
Matter fact I got a ticket, for causing distractions.
I'm like officer my head itched, sir I was scratching.
I swang watch me swing, black Rover sitting clean.
Niggas on my side mirrors, crawling European.
And a European dime, playing hide the ding-a-ling.
My chest don't bling-bling, hell I can't describe the things.
Four/five ice trays on your chest, you understand just what I mean.
Got plex naw I mean, P-shooter with two beams.
Boss Hogg Outlawz, Paid In Full, Rock 4 Rock.
My twin brother is on lock, and I gotta get him out.
The boy blue with Slim Thugger, and my I'm 50-Feezie.
My hustlers and my thugsters, holla back breathe easy.

Chamillionaire.
My candy frame got readjusted,  it isn't wait.
I'm sitting straight on spinning plates, I hit the breaks they getting scraped.
Mo' showing love some niggas hate, we get it now they get it late.
We put it down we innovate, can't keep us out we in the gate.
You hungry Twin go get a plate, I'ma tell you how much we finna make.
If niggas hate that nickel plate, make sure they face disintegrate uh.
Y'all niggas is agitating, your gat is a fashion statement.
You ain't gonna blast you faking, ha-ha  I'm waiting.
I don't hear no shells falling, I don't hear no pistols popping.
Matter fact give me that gat, I'll take that witch you watching.
Niggas be wish she-watching, you know you won't do nothing.
You ain't gon shoot and just gon sue, you better go get you Cochran.
No baller rapper, I'm a all-of-rapper.
We did all of that already, and y'all did all-of after.
Matter fact to be exact, the fact is more then half of.
Y'all rappers new I'm through, I'ma give y'all that chapter Koopa.
