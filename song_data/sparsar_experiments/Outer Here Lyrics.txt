Outer Here Lyrics
by Swych.


Do you want to do you want to do like a *laughs* 
Do. You want to do like a little like improv rap song. 
Yeah give me a beat 
*beatboxes* 
 
Welcome to my world 
Quiet as a library 
Ain't, no one to talk to 
Ain't no place to walk to 
Only things to run from 
And. My mind run a mile, a minute 
Trying to stay like Popeye on the spinach 
Screw. The dealer all these cards I deal with 
Make, you need a dealer, but I'm chilling. 
At least I try to 
Look up at these gray clouds 
Still trying to find blue 
But them hard times. Colorblind, you 
And. They say one day the sun'll shine through but 
Everytime. They say it: why do 
I feel like I'm being lied to 
So? I do 
What. I do 
Just to 
Make it through 
 
, MIC,,
