Dramacyde Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

Kool G. Rap.
No doubt.
The real drama shit.

All ya rap niggas pay homage.
When he raps, spit atomics.

Raise a prophet, make hot lava spit out like vomit.
We Vietnam it, scramble ya brain like an omelette.
Spling baby link the bomb it, keep you reek niggas in bondage.
A convicts we Allah, then we bomb it.
We trom it, it take a Terror Squad to dis arm it.
We layin with grenades in our palms, two hours longer.

Big Punisher.
Ah shit nigga, you got me started momma one of the good boys.
Said she got a 400 pound retarted Bronx nigga from the Projects.
What nigga you don't want it, cock figga figga got it.
You make me sick, fuckin wit Pun, youse a crazy bitch.
Hold him for ransom, or cut off his tongue in cause he itchin.
80 stitches across cheak, 70 more for talkin cheap.
A buck 50 even nigga, that's regulation on the street.

yo and come on scratched.

No man can go against me!

more scratchin.

You don't stop me.

Kool G. Rap.
Probaly socks soes inside the trenches.
Closin in for miles to inches, killin the distance, enemy flinches.
Death finces left for kid limus.
Made mine behind the barb wire fences.
Crossfire tent winters.
Saw my man blow, bandana tied tight like Rambo.
Burn a slug make the land glow.
Niggas screamin for medics and ammo.
Every soldier in your camp go.

Big Punisher.
Me and my man Joe got ya back.
AKA Joey Crack, AK with the mack, makin my to the pack.
Everyday I gotta be strapped, cuz niggas don't know how to act.
You don't wanna go the gap, cuz T-Squad gonna react.
Whatta we go? thugs and ammo, by a hundred tons of guns and rambos.
Just in case you comin Commando.
I'm a Sopranos and Corleones wit they own armies.
And a couple of morrenos that'll die for me.

Kool G. Rap.
Hammers a law under the camouflage here to take jars.
Put a cap inside ya cap and leave a four in your sarge.
Killas are large, my two trade pound gauge will sound hard.
For every round sabotage, bodies hit the ground hard.

Big Punisher.
That's a pound dog bout to get down and put the work.
Try the jury but it wouldn't work, skit but it wouldn't merk.
He glass, no glass, think fast yo ass too late, muthafucka.
Put a d-rap too fast.

scratches.

Act like you want Drama.
Kool G. Rap.
Big Pun.
X-Executioners style.
