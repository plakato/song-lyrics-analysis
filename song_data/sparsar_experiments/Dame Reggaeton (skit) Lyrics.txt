Tell me what you want mami is it my heart.

Tell me what you want I'm down with double R.
Everybody know pirate is out this world.
This is for the cats fighting fevers.
Keep fight till the club closes.
And if your them girls that get down.
I'm on fire so all ya getting burned down.
A lot of them reveal to see.
And I let them do what they want.
The one's that stay I front them.
Suit and a flag and I take a few with me.
I ain't no saint that's why I wake them up.
I like her so much that with Nore I sing to her.
I hold her and caress her... I'm a complete man.
That's why girls don't leave me alone.
And I give them what they ask for.
And this is what they decide.

Tell me what you want mami is it my heart.
You know it papi gimme reggeaton.
Tell me if you like it so I can be your man.
You sure daddy gimme reggeaton.

Tell me what you want mami is it my heart.

Tell me if you like it so I can be your man.
You sure daddy gimme reggeaton.

Lets go lets go its all good line up.

Yeah and we could grind up and you can sign up.
You know baby go head and pour the wine up.
Reggeaton godfather New York boricua.

And I grab her right by the ass that make her mess up.
Catch me in my P.R stance I'm like take that.
Handout my pistol like take that.
And I get ass nothing like menudo.

To my star big ma and killah three harder harder.

Tell me if you like the way that I seduce you.
When pirate gets you high and get you loose ma'.
Everybody knows that my music gets inside you.
When you see what I have its gon' scare you.
Cause you never seen what I brought you.
If you ask questions ma' you'll get put on.
What I'm worth a bill real big ma'.
Come wit me girl cause I'mma calm you down.
And please I ain't looking for no love ma.

Now you gon' see how pirate gonna make you fall.

Let's go hang out I feel like driving around.
