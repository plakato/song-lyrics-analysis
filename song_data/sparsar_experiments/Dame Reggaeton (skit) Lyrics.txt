Tell me what you want mami. Is it my heart? 
You know it papi gim me reggeaton 
Tell me. If you like it, so I can be your man 
You sure, daddy, gim me reggeaton,

Tell me what you want, I'm down with double R 
Everybody know: pirate is out this world. 
This is for the cats fighting fevers 
Keep fight till the club closes 
And. If your them girls that get down 
I'm on fire, so all ya getting burned down. 
A lot of them reveal to see 
And. I let them do what they want. 
The one's that stay. I front them 
Suit and a flag, and I take a few with me: 
I ain't, no saint! That'S why I wake them up 
I like her, so much that with Nore I sing to her 
I hold her and caress her ..., I'm a complete man 
That's! Why girls don't leave me alone 
And, I give them what they ask for 
And. This is what they decide. 
 
Tell me what you want mami! Is it my heart? 
You know it papi gim me reggeaton, 
Tell me. If you like it, so I can be your man, 
You sure, daddy, gim me reggeaton, 
 
Tell me what you want mami. Is it my heart? 
You know it papi gim me reggeaton 
Tell me. If you like it, so I can be your man 
You sure, daddy, gim me, reggeaton,

And. I grab her right by the ass that make her mess up.
