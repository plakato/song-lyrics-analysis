Holla (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

Ain't really gon mean shit to me.
Or E.
Holla if you.
Cause i got anne frank.
Holla if you want some.
And im so fuckin sketch i wear a.
Holla if you really wanna problem.
Yall hot durin summer.
Gotta.
Put the pieces in a pentagram.
Gotta.
But his story simplified.
Misses want a kiss.
From the land of the valley.
So they momma can't I.D.
Bickin back and bein bool.
Rap game deadpool.
I take a look at your demise.
And waldo to hide me.
And get split when the fuckin.
Or craccin on a caddilac.
Pistol whip.
Cut the baby up and.
You think you hotter than oxxy.
You gon' need a lot more.
And tho i haven't done it yet.
Illegitimate villain.
Kill kill.
And im a pimp.
Formula for G's.
Idiot crime syndicate.
And gave myself a new name.
Welcome to the infamous.
Feel like winter to me.

I picked a fuckin mic up.
So you know my dicks spittin for free.
Ing to get the job done.
And i ferment in the benefits.
Ready and will-.
Bumpin teddy pendergrass.
Of their seats.
Im a winner to be.
No internet.
With illnesses in the history.
And i could make a dinner for three.
I got bored of being.
Kill.
Dependable to bend ya back.
Ski mask in the sheets.
And listenin to wu-tang.
Got a line of vigilantes that are.
Got these wack rap faggots on the edge.
Back when we were smoking blunts.
Eat eat.
Cause all jokes aside B.
A 40 and 4G's.
Say it to my face and take a minute to finish him.
Rippem up and cuttem.
This story takes place.
Bring ya side dish.
Eat.
Holla if you.
You offendin me.
Than police to find me.
At the bottom of the food chain.
Of the shadow of death.
Then fuck the baby dead mom.
Years before i took claim.
Satanic orgies.
Had to laugh at that one.
