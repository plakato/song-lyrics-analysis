Salvador Dali Lyrics
by XCEP.


Ring the bell when it's time to slay and kill.
Flipping this shit again every time you think I went chill.
No biggie, I can merk 'em with my eyes closed.
It's Ray Charles, hitting them keys, Overdosed.
Laying out lames as long as the beat goes.
Hot flames, you feel it when the heat blows.
It's all composed, rhymes go like the water flows.
It's elemental, man, this shit going all disposed.
I'm the new Salvador Dali.
Making you watch the sound through the dark valley.
Nothing is real, Switch the lens, Leave the rally.
This the conceptual art from the hood alley.
They never get it so when they ask me  What you do?
I'm playing with your brain, it's the motherfucking Voodoo.
I'm unreal, It's not skill, It's the magic and the energy you feel.
For real, It's always a plain canvas to fill.
I write it with a quill, move anything if it's still.
Giving you that ecstasy, make you feel the thrill.
While they rap about the ecstasy they get from popping pills.
I'm about to go Braille on the sound, feeling every waveform.
Words building every poem, going Louis Aragon.
Rough rugged boom bap beats crushing your bones.
This the lord flowing, killing the mic on a throne.
Y'all can play your games, you can play who you claim.
I'm way too out of the frame, your childish shit is so lame.
Spread the word to create something and have the right aim.
Don't get dragged by the suits, the wealth and fame.
This the type of music you can only find in the books.

While the world is going down, war, injustice and crooks.
Music is holding us together, take your time and look.

Music? when you think about the... Everybody wanna get famous and shit and...
and.. you know.. uh...

I'm a fiend of this shit.
I'm a fiend of this shit bitch.
Cause every time I feel low.
I gotta take these notes and let my brain float.
And I know, I ain't okay.
And I like it that way.
Uh, Man I like it that way.
Dali In this bitch.
Salvador Dali in this bitch.
