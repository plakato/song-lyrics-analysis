Black Keyboard Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

Why would mother say such things?
Why add tongue to a kiss goodnight?
Force me to know the want.
No one needs to know.

Be free.
Laugh at your son.
A child is nothing without hate.
Be certain he feels.
His love is trash.

Be the premier to shriek out.
Hail Bigots!
Hang him.
Hold me mommy.
Face down in your filth.

Why would you tell me how many times.
That my father made you cream?

Rest now.
Be free.
Be free, be free, be free, be free, be free.

A child is no one without pain.
As you pray, head down.
That I find a sensuous love.

Push me mommy.
Eyes ablaze into hell.
