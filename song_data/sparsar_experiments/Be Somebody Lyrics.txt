Be Somebody Lyrics
by Russ.

Produced by Russ.

Maybe you can be somebody.
Something outside of the party.
You run around the streets like all day.
You can't do that and complain.
But maybe you can be somebody.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Lately i been feelin like.
This what i been workin towards.
If you ain't tryna be the boss.
Then tell me what you workin for.
Certain doors were closed but now they opening up.
Celebratin with some shots.
Maybe poke on a couple sluts.
Russells up next and i got this.
Crazy like Britney and her loves so toxic.
Got a wall up im tryna infilitrate her conscious.
Takin 12 shots like where the cops is.
Come on.

You ain't gotta sell yo sex baby.
I know that you tryna get a check baby.
But you got talents you should pursue.
You pushed me out when i pushed you.
You ain't gotta sell yo sex baby.
I know that you tryna get a check baby.
But you got talents you should pursue.
You pushed me out when i pushed you.

Maybe you can be somebody.
Something outside of the party.
You run around the streets like all day.
You can't do that and complain.
But maybe you can be somebody.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Refrain: Russ.
I only see you when im drunk and lonely, lonely.
Dont take it to serious.
You dont know me, know me.

Ride around Atlanta got drugs in the back like a pharmacy.
Thoughts clogged up like an artery.
Out all night like you homeless.
You a dog so you go where the bone is.
And a house ain't a home.
Unless that house is where the dope is.
So you trappin tryna not lose focus.
On what the end goal is.
Hood presidents are compelling.
Even if they all felons now you hopeless but.

Maybe you can be somebody.
Something outside of the party.
You run around the streets like all day.
You can't do that and complain.
But maybe you can be somebody.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
