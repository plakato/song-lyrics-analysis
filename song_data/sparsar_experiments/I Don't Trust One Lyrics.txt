I Don't Trust One.
Yeah.

I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.

Some need a lot but I'm fine with none.
I gotta whole lotta friends, I don't trust one.
We all want money, we all know the game.
And these dudes back stab over petty little things.
I thought I was your homie.
But I'm better off lonely.
Then ride with a phoney.
Life lesson, but dad never told me.
One thing that never goes out of season.
Lies and treason but what's the reason?
Money, fame, cars, and dames.
I'd call you bitches out but there's too many names.

Breakdown.
Too many, too-too many, too many , too many names.
Too many, too-too many, too many , too many names.

I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.

Yeah and they can't be trusted at all.
I don't even save their number when they call.
I was nice to the world when it wasn't to me.
I kept to myself but created enemies.

They can't remember who I am now they can't believe.
They watched it all unfold from behind a screen.
Now my haters wanna shake hands and girls wanna scream.
I don't need fake support when I got my scene with.

Breakdown.
Too many, too-too many, too many , too many names.
Too many, too-too many, too many , too many names.

I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I don't trust one.
I gotta whole lotta friends I don't trust one.
Yeah.

I don't trust one.
Yeah.
