Good Life Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

Pulled out from the station.
Fifteen after two.
300 miles away from Vegas.
We had nothin better to do.
30 dollars left in my pocket.
And three last cigarrettes.
Tom Petty was playing on the radio.
Life was as good as it could get.
We get crazy and we get wild.
But we never did hurt no one.
We get loud and we get high.
Just livin out on the run.
Days are short but our nights are long.
And everybody's singing along.
When we get crazy and we get wild.
We're livin, we're livin the good life.
I spent some time in the city.
Where everything moves so fast.
I met girl.. she was pretty.
But we both knew that it would never last.
I'm living out this red suitcase.
Taking it day by day.
The bright lights became an addiction.
And nothing can take that away.
We get crazy and we get wild.
But we never did hurt no one.
We get loud and we get high.
Just livin out on the run.
Days are short but our nights are long.
And everybody's singing along.
When we get crazy and we get wild.
We're livin, we're just livin the good life.
We get crazy and we get wild.
But we never did hurt no one.
We get loud and we get high.
Just livin out on the run.
Days are short but our nights are long.
And everybody's singing along.
When we get crazy and we get wild.
We're livin, we're livin the good life.
