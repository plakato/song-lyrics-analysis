Front Door Lyrics
by Xali.

Welcome.
American house slave.
Front door shit.

Niggas know the truth.
Where everytime I spit, I swear I only show the roots.
Talking to pieces of shit as scripted off the news.
I flip the vision for you.
Beautiful country where everything is confused.
Left to amuse, eyes of the fool.
Lies in the schools.
Dunk is a muse, the only way to view the value of you.
You're a number, not a name.
With a picture of your face.
On the title of your page of your government profile.
Open your mind to deeper thoughts, my boy.
Grab that 9, drive by and skirt off, my boy.
And even though you keeping a colt.
Wasn't right with the aim, leaving a leak in the soul.
Stray bullets for the kids set to play in the streets.
Step Daddies rubbing their kids while they're laying in sheets.
Couple crimes committed with knives, you get the image.
We living to die by getting live every minute.
America, America, system to set the terror up.
Era of pera in the eschalon, see the era stuck.
Heard my people fold to money, bitches and clothes.
Where they say we don't belong but they stole this from my home, ugh.
Blacks on blacks, stacked on the slave ship.
Racks on racks, still working that slave shift.
Souls, our souls disconnect from the motherland.
Black reign of pain, defend my brothers here.
Fighting the storm is shit that people ignore.
Girls from my younger days, make a profit as whores.
Niggas from those hoop days, try'na even the score.
Put abominable Kate at the step of your door.
The upper eschalon beyond the lines of time.
Hold bulk over the borders, try'na hold my mind.
Coking up people.
Vision of future, that you belie.
See the truth behind their lie.
The pyramid in the sky.
Tell me what I buys for my ma' when the summers eyes from the holy ghost to.
the soul, either way I'mma shine.
Bringing incense and myrrh.
Hoping I can find sense of worth.
