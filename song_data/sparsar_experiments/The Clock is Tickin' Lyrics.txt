The Clock is Tickin' Lyrics
by Woodie.

Woodie 
Bullets fly 
Quicker than the eyes. 
You was hittin', Mary-Jane 
To ease the pain, 
Your homie died, 
Muthafucka, I'm a ride. 
To the rallies on steel 
I'm in the bushes, camouflage, 
Ain't thinkin''bout, no clientele 
If. I fail I'll rot in jail 
And. If I succeed, 
I'll burn in hell 
So either way. I'M fucked in these streets, 
The Bible says I live. My life rough 
Statistics say I'll die. Young 
I can't disagree, cuz, I'm a 
Fuckin' walkin' time bomb. 
The clock is tickin'. 
Finger'S itchin' 
To unleash a beast: 
And 32 empty homies 
That are dyin' to feast 
Upon your flesh, you wan na kill me 
Sucka, really 
Ya'll the type that pull your strap 
And shoot holes in the ceiling. 
And I get out for killin' 
Sucka, give it up 
With your strap beside and ride 
To the club and live it up. 
 
Out to the cuts 
The clock is tickin'. 
Finger'S itchin' 
In, the bushes camouflaged 
Waiting for my victim 
 
Woodie 
I, never thought that. I would live 
To see the age of 21. 
I grew up paranoid 
One eye open sleepin'. With my gun, 
50 dollars bought my first 
Strap a sawed off one shot gauge 
Since the a day I lay the blaze. 
I was stuck in evil ways: 
In amaze, 
At. The power that it could devour 
Strip that O.G. from his reputation 
In the late night hour, 
Show shower let the situation sour, funk, 
But ain't, no stoppin', the poppin' 
That gets the droppin'. These punks 
I found my callin' and I 

Preferrin' 45 calibur's over 9 miler's 
The 5-0s out peel us 
So. I creep with caution 
Steppin' out a skylark 
On them red chucks, flossin' hoggin' 
I'll, be that muthafucka that you hate 
Cuz. You know I'll take that clip and 
Slap it in and test your fate. 
And demonstrate the Yoc influenced 
State of mind that I'm stuck 
I'll be committin', sins wit. A devilish, grin 
I gives a fuck 
 
Woodie 
Creepin' crawlin' 
Strap, not fallin'. 
But got a box of ammo 
For, the weapon that I'm haulin' 
The streets are callin' 
So, I'm comin' with artillery 
And chucks and khakis 
As. I move up on my enemies, 
A pedigree soldier 
Yeah. That'S were the foul 
Northern Cal profile, 
Nothin' less. I confess 
I'm a sinner 
But. How can I show remorse 
Cuz? I can't afford to let the Bible 
Throw me off course: 
I'm known to ride 
With. What I got to make these 
Sucka's skull crack 
It could be better than 
Havin' my chips and a yacht. 
And bet the whole stack 
Do or die 
Make. These muthafuckas understand 
That they're tryin' to touch 
A particle that they can't comprehend 
Can't pretend to be a soldier 
When. Your a punk 
Cuz it'll hold ya 
Hog tied in the trunk 
And name, one chump 
Run your mouth 
And. Now your bent up like a slut 
Should, have kept your pistol cocked 
Fuckin', with this Yoc nut 
 
Out to the cuts echoes out
