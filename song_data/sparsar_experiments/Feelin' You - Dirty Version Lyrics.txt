Feelin' You - Dirty Version Lyrics
by 3LW.

You're the heart of me.
Had to tell you a little.
Baby, pardon me.
If I sweat you a little.
It's just the effect you have.
I don't quite understand myself but.
I ain't worried about it.
Cause I see it in you.
No, I ain't worried about it.
I see you're feeling it too.
I just wanted to put it on your mind.
I think that you're one of a kind.
And I know cause I.
I done had others in my life that I like.
But I ain't feel them like I'm feelin' you.
Every time we talk, every time we touch.
I get a rush cause I can tell you're really feelin' me too, me too.
And it's rare, it's rare.
These days to find somebody who really cares, who cares.
You mean everything in my life and I wanna share.
These ways I never felt cause I'm really, really feelin' you.
You really got a way that I just can't deny.
You be on my mind from night to sunrise.
And even if I try to fake it, I know I'll never shake it.
You got a kiss that make me flip and I would never trade it.
Twenty four seven, three sixty five.
Your love is staying fly, your love is staying right.
Forever and ever I need you.
I never, no, never will find a nigga better.
Ooh, I been meanin' to tell ya.
It's the way that you look that's so irresistible.
And it's the way you touch me that's so incredible.
There's no other, you are my lover.
From beginning to end, I'll say it again.
Forever and ever, I need you.
I never, no, never will find a nigga better.
Ooh, I been meaning to tell ya.
I done had others in my life that I like.
But I ain't feel them like I'm feelin' you.
Every time we talk, every time we touch.
I get a rush cause I can tell you're really feelin' me too, me too.
And it's rare, it's rare.
These days to find somebody who really cares, who cares.
You mean everything in my life and I wanna share.
These ways I never felt cause I'm really, really feelin' you.
Now, now, now, baby you know how hard it is.
Tryna find the right one.
I done had lovers in my life but you're like none.
I love your whole style, physique, you're so sweet.
Petite, type of girl I let hold my Jeep.
My parking lot, pimpin' slow up.
Tell 'em girls hold up, me and you, no luck.
I got it girl, sho' nuff and I feel like I'm gettin' it bad.
Cause I ain't felt like this since I was a lad.
My whole mood when I'm around you change.
I keep you around new thangs, I pull up and your brow do raise.
You the shorty I was lookin' for, one I had to push up on.
Seein' that you up out of ya crew, true.
And everything I do is for you.
The love you give me in bundles.
Is the same way I feel for you, for you.
And everything I do is for you.
The love you give me in bundles.
Is the same way I feel for you, for you.
Word.
I done had others in my life that I like.
But I ain't feel them like I'm feelin' you.
Every time we talk, every time we touch.
I get a rush cause I can tell you're really feelin' me too, me too.
And it's rare, it's rare.
These days to find somebody who really cares, who cares.
You mean everything in my life and I wanna share.
These ways I never felt cause I'm really, really feelin' you, you.
I done had others in my life that I like.
But I ain't feel them like I'm feelin' you.
Every time we talk, every time we touch.
I get a rush cause I can tell you're really feelin' me too, me too.
And it's rare, it's rare.
These days to find somebody who really cares, who cares.
