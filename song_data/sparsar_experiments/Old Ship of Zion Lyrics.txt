Old Ship of Zion Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

I was standing on the banks of the river.
Looking out over life?s troubled sea.
When I saw that ole ship that was sailing.
Is that the ole ship of Zion I see.

Its hull was bent and battered.
From the storms of life I could see.
Waves were rough but that ole ship kept sailing.
Is that the ole ship of Zion I see.

At the stern of the ship stood the captain.

I could hear as he called out my name.
Get on board it?s the ole ship of Zion.
It will never pass this way again.

As I step on board I?ll be leaving.
All my sorrows and heartaches behind.
I?ll be safe with Jesus the captain.
Sailing out on the ole ship of Zion.
