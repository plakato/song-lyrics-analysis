Do The Knife Fight Lyrics

J-J-Joe.
Gave.

Tour.
Of his house.
Joe.

Tour.
Of his house.
Joe.

Tour.
Of his house.
Joe.
Gave.
Me.
A.
Tour.
Of his house.

Do the knife fight.
Stick it in and twist.
Into the ribs, between the bones.
I don't care where it goes.

Oh, just don't ask me to choose.
Go.

I think the time is right.
Between the alley of the school.
Behind the church.
On the roof.
Grab the sheets.
Grab the stuff.
We can Oooooooooow....

I wanna rupture.
I wanna rupture.
I wanna rupture your jugular.
I wanna rupture.
I wanna rupture.
I wanna rupture your jugular.
I wanna splay your varicose veins.
I wanna splay your varicose veins.

Just don't ask me to choose.

Blood type a, blood type b.
Doesn't matter cause his bloods on me.
Blood type a, blood type b.
Doesn't really matter cause his bloods on me.

Do the knife fight.
Do the knife fight.
Do the knife fight.
Do the knife fight.
