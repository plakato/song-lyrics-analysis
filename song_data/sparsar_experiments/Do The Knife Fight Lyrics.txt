Do The Knife Fight Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

J-J-Joe 
Gave 
Me 
A 
Tour 
Of, his house 
Joe 
Gave 
Me 
A 
Tour 
Of, his house 
Joe 
Gave 
Me 
A, 
Tour 
Of, his house 
Joe 
Gave, 
Me, 
A, 
Tour 
Of, his house 
 
Do, the knife fight 
Stick it in and twist 
Into the ribs between the bones. 
I. Don'T care where it goes, 
 
Oh, just don't ask me to choose 
Go, 
 
I, think the time is right. 
Between the alley of the school 
Behind, the church, 
On the roof 
Grab the sheets 
Grab, the stuff 
We can Oooooooooow ... 
 
I wan na rupture, 
I wan na rupture, 
I wan na rupture, your jugular 
I wan na rupture 
I wan na rupture, 
I wan na rupture. Your jugular 
I wan na splay, your varicose veins 
I wan na splay, your varicose veins, 
 
Just. Don'T ask me to choose 
 
Blood type, a blood type b, 
Doesn't matter cause his bloods on me. 
Blood type, a blood type b, 
Doesn't really matter cause his bloods on me: 
 
Do, the knife fight 
Do, the knife, fight 
Do, the knife fight 
Do, the knife, fight
