A Message Lyrics
by Akala.


Why are men so weak?
I ain't got the answer.
Any boy can bust a nut.
Takes a man to be a father and a partner.
Especially young and poor, makes it harder.
So we fuck and flee the glee of dicks harder.
See every man wants to be loved as much as women do.
But we are men, who we gonna admit it to.
Especially in these streets when we pose like a killer do.
When we say they're hoes does that go for our sisters too?
And I ain't saying i'm perfect.
Far from it.
Chauvinistic pig, but shit, i'm working on.
From the day I woke up and realised that I hated women.
Which is dumb, cos I was only raised by women.
And I ain't saying they're perfect they would admit they ain't.
But they ain't doing 99% of the rape.
Male supremacy got us thinking its cool.
And women are just objects we do things to.

This is a message to my little sisters.
Growing up in this world with no father figures.
Deep down need that love from a man.
So she get it anyway that she can, yo.
This is a message to my little brothers.
Growing up in this cold world with only mothers.
Trying their hardest to be a man.
Gettin' the gram feed the fam only way you can.

If most mothers acted exactly like most daddies do.
There would be an even bigger bigger bag of homeless youths.
Runnin' the streets, feeling unloved.
How many so called tugs.
That grew up with only mums.
What if daddy stayed around.
Showed him what a man was about.
What if he wasn't 8 when he became the man of the house.
Where would he be now?
Disciplined, smarter.
Mums wouldn't have kicked him out for lookin' just like her partner.
Instead when she glance at her son?
It's a reminder of the beatings that he gave her.
How he mentally enslaved her.
All the while he was abusing she looked at him like a savior.
But nobody but herself could save her.
And now her eldest son in and out of the prison and women like his daddy.
And daughter 15 dropping a baby on the family.

Listen.
What about the daughters.
We always hear about the boys madness.
What about the girls born to a dad absent.
Told her she was the princess, him and mummy fell out.
Ever since then? quickly just lost interest.
On to the next piece of skirt with a thin dress.
Odd, the lessons we learn we don't sin less.
We leave daughters, just because we can.
And she after any affection she can have in a man.
Same type of girl we turn and call a slag.
I ain't sayin' I never did it i'm just sayin' its mad.
Cos cuz?
Been 15 and suicidal sad.
I don't know what it was.
Maybe I miss my dad.
All the things I never had, making me mad.
In a world that says you don't have? You're basically bad.
If we have half the parents.
Are we half the person then?
Has it always been like this?
Is this the curse of men?
But then again, even if they stayed together.
I don't know if its necessarily better.
If they're at each other's throats, or just plain ignore.
Parents, they fuck you up they do, that's for sure.
Then we grow up.
And turn up just like you.
The question is?
Can we break the cycle.
