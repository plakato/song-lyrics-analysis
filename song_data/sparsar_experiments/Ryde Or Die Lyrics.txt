Ryde Or Die Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.

Sheek.
Yo if you gon' sleep on somethin, might as well be a bed.
And if you gon' crack a nigga, might as well be a head.
Cause if you target the LOX.
You might as as well target a box.
That you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks.
Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got.
Ya hotshots ain't got blocks, ya puta muchacha.
From the days in school, now a motherfucker rule.
Enough to drop my chain in coffee and keep shit cool.
That's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest.
And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest.
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk.
The baby nine be on the daily, ain't no poppin a trunk.
But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag.
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag.
Must I brag? My shit paid for, yours tagged.
And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek been done bagged.

Jadakiss.
Hey yo I hope you ain't tongue-kissin your spouse.
Cause I be fuckin her in the mouth.
Type of nigga buck at your house.
Too slick, means she be suckin my dick.
And before you know it, I'mma have her stuffin my bricks.
Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later.
I been nice since niggas was watchin movies on Beta.
Ready to clap, everybody givin me daps.
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps.
Listen to y'all shit, then listen to our shit.
Ain't nuttin y'all faggots could do but gossip.
That's the reason now y'all niggas ain't got shit.
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the LOX dick.
Niggas thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel.
Give it to em at the light, like Caine's cousin Harold.

The Ruff Ryders!  The Ruff Ryders.

Styles.
Fuck you and your son, y'all lower than scum.
Show me the money, I'll show you a gun, motherfucker.
S-P will spin the corner while.
you parle' with dun.
I clap you, I clap him, and thats rule number one.
Suckin my dick, and I dont give a fuck what you spit.
Who you are, where you from, and who the fuck you could get.
Cause I sell records, plus I got a jail record.
Y'all niggas ain't sayin shit until y'all bare weapons.
And even when you dead, you can still fuckin get it.
A nigga that'll smack ya, fuck around and clap ya.
Styles P., your favorite rapper's favorite rapper.

Eve.
Ain't no surprise niggas, only fuck wit recognized niggas.
Babygirl want the world, gave ya pies niggas.
No tops, take em in all shapes and size niggas.
No lie, prefer them ready do or die niggas.
What? What you want? cutey starin at me like.
Damn, where you from? You be comin at me like.
Can I get some? Lick your lips for this brown sugar.
Suck me like a thumb, if you want, til I come, uh.

Drag-On.
I be the D-R, A-G, dash O-N, slash often.
Comma, burnin niggas often.
They call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin.
Keep the block roastin.
Light a dutch wit the flames coma-toastin'.
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin.
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead ride.
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty.
Cause it got one buried, so you better run, hurry.
Or catch one early.
You wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?
You better throw your boots on and your unflammable suits on.
Cause I'm comin through in a Yukon.
Black tinted wit gats in it.
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it.
But only half of it, cause y'all are half-ass dude.
And we are one whole, and y'all niggas is one slash two.
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're they, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a backdraft.
Cause my fire retire men.

DMX.
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water.
Everyday I show another how I love a slaughter.
Plug your daughter, full of more holes than sponges.
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches.
With these, I shoot the breeze, and extort.
Enough ki's from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort.
Caught up in somethin that I can't control.
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll that's swoll.
Catchin' bodies like a cold, and I stay sick so face it.
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it.
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit.
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I.
Love money, but the scramblin's hot.
So I snatch up my man and hit the gamblin spot.
Twenty grand has got, one nigga shot, one nigga less.
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fucking vest.
