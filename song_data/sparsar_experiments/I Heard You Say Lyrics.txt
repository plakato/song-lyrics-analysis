I Heard You Say Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

I heard you say.

See the road.
Long and lonesome road.
Dozens come from many miles away.

See the lights.
They go on for miles.
But you'll never see the light again in his smile.

Now you are gone, are they moving on?
Don't listen girl.
Listen what they say.

Got no soul, got no rock and roll.
And he'll never hold me in his arms again.
I'm so cold.

And I heard you say I heard you say.
Almost took my breath away.

No, he will never hold me in his arms again.
He'll never hold me in his arms again.
I'm so cold.

And I heard you say I heard you say.
Almost took my breath away.

No, he'll never hold me in his arms again.
You never hold me in his arms again.
I'm so cold.
