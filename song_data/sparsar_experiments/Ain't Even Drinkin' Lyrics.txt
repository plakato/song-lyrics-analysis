Ain't Even Drinkin' Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Must be something in her lipstick.
Got me this messed up just off her kiss.
Kicked back and I'm feeling all right.
Parked by the river she's got her.
Tan lines hanging out by the water.
Better slow down if I'm gonna tie one on tonight.

Ain't even drinkin' but I'm buzzing baby.
Ain't even smoking but I'm so stoned.
Feels like I'm getting lit.
Ain't even took a sip.
But I'm already gone.
Too drunk to drive home.
And I ain't even drinkin'.

Don't need no rum or Bacardi.
Cause that girl she's my kinda party.
She's the only shot that I need.
Sun sinks she starts to get frisky.
One touch and I'm feeling tipsy.
Somebody take my keys.

Ain't even drinkin' but I'm buzzing baby.
Ain't even smoking but I'm so stoned.
Feels like I'm getting lit.
Ain't even took a sip.
But I'm already gone.
Too drunk to drive home.
And I ain't even drinkin'.

She's got me feelin' fine.
Higher than a Georgia pine.
Stronger than homemade shine.
She gets me every time.

Ain't even drinkin' but I'm buzzing baby.
Ain't even smoking but I'm so stoned.
Feels like I'm getting lit.
Ain't even took a sip.
But I'm already gone.
Too drunk to drive home.
And I ain't even drinkin'.
Ain't even drinkin'.
Ain't even drinkin'.
