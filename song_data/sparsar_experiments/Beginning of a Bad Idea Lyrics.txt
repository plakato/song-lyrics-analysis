Beginning of a Bad Idea Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.


Comfortable like an old sweater.
Memorable, you just can't forget her.
Starting over is the hardest thing to do.

Eventually we'll just do the same thing.
Starting over is impossible with you.

So don't pick up anymore.
When I call you up.
Cause it's the beginning.
Of a bad idea.
A bad idea.

Loneliness has a way of magnifying this.
Feeling that I'm still not, no I'm not over you.

I'm still in love with you.
Guess I'll love you from a distance.
