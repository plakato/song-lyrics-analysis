Youth Gone Wild Lyrics
by Swindle.


Woah yeah....

Since I was born, they couldn't hold me down.
Another misfit kid, another burned-out town.
I never played by the rules and I never really cared.
My nasty reputation takes me everywhere.

Well I look and see it's not only me.
So many others, have stood where I stand.
We are the young  so raise your hands!

They call us problem child.
We spend our lives on trial.
We walk an endless mile.

We stand and we won't fall.
We're one and one for all.
The writing's on the wall.

My boss screamin' my ear 'bout who I'm s'posed to be.
Get a three-piece Wall Street smile, and son you'll look just like me.
I said Hey man, there's somethin' you oughta know, well I'll tell ya Park.
Avenue leads to !!

Well I look and see it's not only me.
We're standing tall, ain't never a doubt.
We are the young  so shout it out!

They call us problem child.
We spend our lives on trial.
We walk an endless mile.

We stand and we won't fall.
We're one and one for all.
The writing's on the wall.

Well lemme hear ya get wild!

They call us problem child.
We spend our lives on trial.
We walk an endless mile.

We stand and we won't fall.
We're one and one for all.
The writing's on the wall.

Woah  Woah.

Woah  Woah.

Yeah  Yeah.

Woah  Woah.
