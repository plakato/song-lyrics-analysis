Clover Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.


You'Re, our next president
Your price, on our island

Clover to get on your rewards
It all reaches you slower than first
Charm brings you any less
Like me this morning is to violet lights
Clover to get on your rewards
It all reaches you slower than first

Open you skin
So, more than slow motion
With. You rocking around the limb
And tumble
Whoooooooooooooo

Clover to get on your rewards
It all reaches you slower than first
Your. Greed is as we'll ever know
In your garden of morning. Stroll
Clover to get on your rewards
It all reaches you slower than first

Your. Greed is as we'll ever know
And In your garden of morning. Stroll
And grow x3
And grow, let it grow
