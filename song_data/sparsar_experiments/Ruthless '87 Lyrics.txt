Ruthless '87 Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

Our song sounds like a high school fight song.
Why? cause we don't get along.
So don't get me wrong I don't want to see your  pretty face again.
Cause there's something to be said about someone.
Singing the words and actually meaning them.
But I got no one to impress cause all my heroes are dead.
Yeah all my heroes are dead.
But I still got my friends.

Ohh and they know what you said, and this song is the bounty on your head.

Cause this is the resistance and it's futile to resist this.
Our friends know all our songs and they're still wearing our shows wristbands.
“we're nothing without you” - but you're nothing but bad for.
business.
And I don't give second chances, did you actually think you were gonna win.

Don't you know who you're messing with?
Cause these words all like weapons for an army of kids.
Who wear their heart on their sleeves with a vengeance.
Completely reckless, in their search for equivalents to our hearts, electric.

But you're what makes it so much worse.
You make things so much worse it's because.

Ohhh I know what you did, and this song is the bounty on your head.

Cause this is the resistance and it's futile to resist this.
Our friends know all our songs and they're still wearing our shows wristbands.
“we're nothing without you” - but you're nothing but bad for.
business.
And I don't give second chances, did you actually think you were gonna win.

Don't you know who you're messing with?
Cause these words are like weapons for an army of kids.
Who wear their heart on their sleeves with a vengeance.
Completely reckless, in our search for equivalents to our hearts, electric.
I'd expect it to be anything but easy Ohhh.

Cause this is the resistance and it's futile to resist this.
Our friends know all our songs and they're still wearing our shows wristbands.
You said we're nothing without you but you're nothing but bad for business.
And I don't give second chances, did you actually think you were gonna wi.
