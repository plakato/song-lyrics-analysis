Underground Tactics (radio) Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Wake-Up Show international something in a foreign language.
This is hip-hop music, and this is all we got.
Representin hip-hop worldwide.
Give it up y'all The worldwide Wake-Up Show.
Sway and Tech.

Rock.
Yo, that's the man Rock.
So if you can stand what I be doin.
Yo who you think you're foolin, you'll be shittin when I be screwin.
Your crew's doo-doo and you seem to think that I be jokin.
Buckshot Got Me Opin as you get your body broken.
Foldin, hoes get, dropped like dominos an'.
Fear of my Boot Camp'll have you runnin like a nose, man.
I sniff, I smell pussy on the set.
But he better jet cuz I like my nigga's pussy wet.
BOO-YAH, do ya, brain your wigs pushed back.
Black I swing bats and break backs over crackerjacks.
I'm JUST LIKE THAT.

Word to miz Mr. Flipsta flips wit some bigger shit.
Wit an extra clip, longer than my kneecap to my hip.
Now you plead the Fifth.
Used to riff, guess I should've known you was bluffin.
You better guard your melon kid 'fore Ra throw a slug in.

Ruck.
My culture, colt ya, sculpture, vultures.
Who in-sult the lyrics that Big Ruck wrote ya.
Bitch-ass niggas don't wanna test the skills.
Word is bond god I think you best to chill.
See I splash flesh, money like crash test dummies.
And cash checks bluntly when radios pump me.
Due to circumstances in my lyrical advances.
Another man die, why, cuz of my verbal enhancements.
Transmit, lyrics over bass and your treble.
Then I'm vexed cuz the devil can't take me to that next level.
If push came to shove, I push drugs.
Shove slugs in niggas mugs who show the Ruck no love.

Crooked Eye/Tech N9NE.
You probably heard me on The Anthem.
Throwin a tantrum, now the phantom's.
Kidnappin platinum rappers for ransom, murder em at random.
Hand em they cranium on a platter.
Then scatter, splatter your bladder.
Niggas got to add up the data, they scatter.
When I brings the whoo-ra, I'm in this game to stay.
You couldn't put me out if your name was neutron.
My receital's prime to climb, homicidal rhymes unwind.
My rival's minds and time, they vital signs decline.
Your title's mine, resign, leave you blind.
Cuz every line's designed to shine.
And I'm, all about the lyrical skills advancing.
Tech drops the beat, I starts the verbally break-dancin.
Cuz first I do my foot-work then I break it down to my knees.
And now I'm spinnin around on my back, ?when melon? ?
Better stop and freeze, please.
You MC's ain't never wanna bout.
You need to make like a cecerious-section and cut it out.
I'm pure devotion, dosin.
The psychological field have chosen, to analyze my notions.
But most men, catch emotion, sickness cuz my intelligence quotient.
Goes deep as the Mediterranean o-cean.
Me and Sway in the concrete jungle bringin comotion.
Our blood might be boilin but our attitude is frozen.
See me pass up a chance to rip shop, naw.
That'll be worse than Kool Herc sayin Fuck hip-hop ya'll.
That'll never happen.
I'll be bustin even after half the major labels start.
Financially backin this rappin.
Rhymin's my first love, she's been wit me from the start.
I exchange vowels wit my styles, now it's till death do us part.

Planet Asia.
Slang exhaust dust, I lace tracks quick.
In tournaments, I can't fit the throne that I sit upon, is permanent.
Splashin Lugers wit my Chaka Zulu.
Observe the numero uno schoolyard assassin.
That's fastin to sock it to you.
Fuck a team my theme's state of the art.
Jumped up and cross seas, sellin em dubs over a pub by the quarts.
Now how that sound, Fresno, Cali's even on the map now.
Tech holdin down the back ground.
We flip chips for rings and championships.
Desperado wit the convo, guerilla congo.
Killin ? black wit his eyes on troop.
Before I disappear in a flash.
Me without pizzazz like a warrior wit a spear up his ass.
From '99 down to the last second.
A devastation, findin out like it's the last record.
A revelation, it's on a suitcase full of magnificent poems.
And testaments, most cats is pestilence in terrestrial form.
I'm out there, and I doubt there is any comp.
Against the relentless, rap assassin holdin it down in the swamps.
My gun claps acts, these raps run laps around irregular run waves.
Whatever the cirumstance to uplift, I shoots the gift.
It's futuristic, how my patterns they switch.
And how the wacker gets rich, I assume while they're down bitin and shit.

Twenty-four bars of rage shakin Bay Area earthquakes up.
It's like that, lettin loose juice wit forty-duece.
First class proof, product and that's the platinum truth.
Schoolyard to the fullest, that's the platinum truth.
Cali Agent to the fullest, that's the platinum truth.
