Click Clack (Make Dat Money) Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Gon na walk right through that door, High heels on a hardwood floor, 
They all coming back for more. It'S a party tonight, hey hey 
Get it up and do it right this time, 
Never gon na stop till the beat is mine 
Come'round. If you're so inclined. It'S a party tonight, 
 
Where, my girls go gon', be a good show. 
Hey girl, you go gon' gon' gon' make dat money. 
Body'S insane now go make it rain. 
Hey girl, you go. Gon' gon' gon' make dat money. 
 
Where my girls at Make your heels. Clap 
Where my girls at Make your heels, clap, 
Click, clack click, clack, uh, Everybody, everybody! Do you hear that 
Click clack click, clack uh, That's sound of a slingback 
 
 Lem me get another track DJ. All the brothers wan na eat this cake. 
 Lem me show you how to instigate a party tonight. 
 Lem me hear your Jimmy Choo's Louboutin. What you gon na do: 
My Manolo Blahnik's gon na party tonight, 
 
Peanut butter head kiss, my grits 
Yo Moma's in the kitchen, but her oven on the fritz 
Yo Daddy's in jail, raising hell, 
And, yo sister's on the corner selling, something for sale, 
Something for sale. Something for sale, 
Yo, sister's on the corner, something something for sale
