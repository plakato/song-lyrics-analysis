Click Clack (Make Dat Money) Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Gonna walk right through that door, High heels on a hardwood floor.
They all coming back for more, it's a party tonight hey, hey.
Get it up and do it right this time.
Never gonna stop till the beat is mine.
Come 'round if you're so inclined, it's a party tonight.

Where my girls go, gon' be a good show.
Hey girl, you go gon' - gon' - gon' make dat money.
Body's insane, now go make it rain.
Hey girl, you go gon' - gon' - gon' make dat money.

Where my girls at? Make your heels clap.
Where my girls at? Make your heels clap.
Click clack - click clack uh! Everybody, everybody do you hear that.
Click clack - click clack uh! That's sound of a slingback.

Lemme get another track DJ, all the brothers wanna eat this cake.
Lemme show you how to instigate a party tonight.
Lemme hear your Jimmy Choo's! Louboutin, what you gonna do?
My Manolo Blahnik's gonna party tonight.

Peanut butter head, kiss my grits.
Yo Moma's in the kitchen but her oven on the fritz.
Yo Daddy's in jail raising hell.
And yo sister's on the corner selling something for sale.
Something for sale, something for sale.
Yo sister's on the corner something something for sale.
