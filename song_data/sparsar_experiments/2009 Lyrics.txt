2009 Lyrics
by The Swellers.

I keep on my shoulders the weight of the world.
But I broke when you asked for a ride.
I'll be outside.

I guess you're just bored and you're boring like me.
And if you don't keep me happy someone will.
I'll be all right.

I didn't know there's a roller coaster in town.
Been gone too long.
I'm prepared for the ups and downs.
But sometimes.
Yeah, sometimes you wanna get off.

I'll never feel the same again.
But I wouldn't re-write anything.
Let's hope your resolution's made.
Yeah.

A minute to midnight.
And I'm bailing out.
Nothing to kiss but pavement now.
We're counting down.

I can't believe I used to like losing to you.
And if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, then.
That's what you said.
Where are your friends?
Who are you gonna tell?
Been gone too long.
I guess the time alone will do you well.

I'll never feel the same again.
But I wouldn't re-write anything.
Let's hope your resolution's made.
Happy New Year, you're dead to me.
Now that I've set the record straight:.
This is my holiday.
This is my holiday.

I'll never feel the same again.
But I wouldn't re-write anything.
Let's hope your resolution's made.
Happy New Year, you're dead to me.
Now that I've set the record straight:.
This is my holiday.
