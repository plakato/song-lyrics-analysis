All Ya Gotta Do Is Touch Me Lyrics
by Woodie Guthrie.

All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me;.
All ya gotta do is touch me good.
All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me;.
All ya gotta do is touch me good.

All ya gotta do is touch me easy.
All ya gotta do is touch me slow.
All ya gotta do is hug me squeeze me.
All ya gotta do is let me know.

I fully aim, to get my soul known again.
As the maniac, the saint, the sinner, the drinker, the thinker, the queer.
I am the works, the whole works.
And it's not 'till you have called me all of these things.
That I feel satisfied, I feel satisfied.

All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me;.
All ya gotta do is touch me good.
All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me;.
All ya gotta do is touch me good.

All ya gotta do is kiss me, kiss me.
All ya gotta do is kiss me nice.
All ya gotta do is touch me all day.
All ya gotta do's kiss me all night.

No one will ever know, when you are ready, ready for me.
But I know when you feel ready for me.
And you know when I feel ready for you.
The others will never know.
They will never know, in all of their words.

All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me;.
All ya gotta do is touch me good.
All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me;.
All ya gotta do is touch me good.

Let me see the way you move.
Warm skin soft with a cat step groove.
Let me do what you hope I'll do.
Let me think what you want me to.
