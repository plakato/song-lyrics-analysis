Urgh Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


Urgh.
These rappers be lying.
These niggas be trying.
To do what they can't.
Urgh.
They copy my style.
They copy the flow.
They would rather be me.
Urgh.
Know why you sad.
Know why you mad.
This shit is too hard.
Urgh.
I make it look easy.
Get on your knees.
Better worship the god.
Bow down bitch better bow down.
Its going down, yeah yeah its going down.
RCA on my heels now, talking 3 mills now.
Taking record deals now.
I know how it feels now.
Should I sign to label.
I'm a contract rebel.
Too many offers on my table.
Told these rappers from day one they ain't on my level.

Crime after crime I'm outchea nigga no lie.
Time after time I'm outchea tryna get by.
Rhyme after rhyme living dreams money can't buy.
I swear to God I won't rest until the day that I die.

Urgh.
Remember watching the telly.
Then I seen Nelly.
Rapping to Kelly.
Urgh.
Now its dilemma, with Emma.
Balling in Spain with no Neymar.
Urgh.
They talking Versace.
I'm rocking Givenchy.
Givenchy, Givenchy.
Ricardo Tisci, Rottweiler T-Shirt.
Sippin dat D'usse.
Cliché cliché nigga whatchu say.
Touché touché nigga whatchu say.
One of the best, in the UK.
Thats what they say, thats what they say.
Today is my day, today is my day.
I am okay, I am okay.
Are you better than me? Nigga no way.
Dressing so fresh, off the runway.

Urgh.
I never had cash.
They were so harsh.
They thought we were trash.
Urgh.
Remember in class.
Hating on us.
Now they look up to us.
Urgh.
Fuck all this hype.
I'm not your type.
I'm never on Skype.
I am the king.
So many rings.
Dare you to step in my ring.
I'm on 46 going 50-0.
26 KO, If she look like JLO.
I swear Ima try to smash your hoe.
You already know put that bitch on leash.
Don't make me unleash the Mayweather in me.

No Lil B but I will teach you how to cook.
