by HV Gutter.

with us then go.. yeah.



just how it goes, since like back in 2004 the only thing I know, is every.
friends are in it for the ride along, man thats the type of shit that make me.
holla at big bro, cause ain't no time for turning back I done waited too long,.
you took walk in my shoes, tell me who I am, tell me how'd I get here,.

fucking far I'd go, since Jokaz Trick I swear they want me for my pot of gold,.
grindin get straight to the point you niggas wouldn't even know what to do if.
but every step is for the Fam I just thought you should know, if you ain't.
everyday's a different day but you feel like you been here, tell me how feels.
do if you took walk in my shoes, tell me who I am, tell me how'd I get here,.
blazed when we thought it would go, and if you got something to say come and.
HV Gutter and you grinded all Summer long, feel like your closest.
stay grinding get straight to the point you niggas wouldn't even know what to.
wanna ride alone, can't no one tell me that I didn't do it on my own, gettin'.
stoned walking home writing on my phone on my lonely road and it's cold that's.
what I wanna when I want nigga, I'm just steady mobbin' niggas hate but I, I.
everydays a different day but you feel like you been here, tell me how feels.
HV Gutter I'm so sick and tired of these fake niggas, I say what I.
when they say you gon get it next year.. yeah.
HV Gutter yeah, I'm so sick and tired of these fake niggas, I say.
time we took it back where we started before, before the hate just getting.
when they say you gon get it next year.
I run the Rose if you didn't you should probably should know, I think it's.
wanna when I want nigga, I'm just steady mobbin niggas hate but I, I stay.
