Hearsay Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Say ahhhh.
Say ahhhh bitch I make 'em say ahhhh.
Say ahhhh bitch I make 'em say.

All you wanna do is hustle but ya game is pretty low.
You aiming for the bitty bitches not impressed my Kajmans broke.
You came in clame a name and make a song and now you acting pro.
I'm coming for the fame you think i'm joking you can watch me glo.

Fuck it i'm broke.
Dirty i'm dope.
I got the burner in coat.
I got a hundred of those.
I'm coming back packed up like an all black dresser.
I know it's jynn the professor not many kids do it better.
I'm gone you better make it bust leave the drugs or you are stuck.
I am the only fucking spic that's leaving you up in the dust.
I got 3 stacks up in the whip like I can't flip all of this shit.
Bitches acting like them trappers but you tryna be the shit bitch.

Ahhh.
Say ahhhh bitch I make 'em say ahhhh.
Say ahhhh bitch I make 'em say.
