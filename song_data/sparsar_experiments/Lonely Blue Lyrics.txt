Lonely Blue Lyrics
by Unleash The Sky.

An empty chair, empty for so long.
And the radio is playing just the same old song.
Too tired to sleep, too weak to fight.
So she closed her eyes and started to write.

Even if it's hard, one thing is for sure.
That it takes time till everything is cured.
Just listen to your heart, it tells you to let go.
And that it takes time till every wing is cured.
Just listen to your heart.

Line by line in lonely blue.
Straight from the heart where every word's so sad but true.
Sealed with a kiss and a lullaby.
About a bird with a broken wing and the will to fly.

Keep on holding my head up high.
And I always will be.
With your kiss and this lullaby.
You are right beside me.
