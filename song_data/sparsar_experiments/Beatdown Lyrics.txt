Beatdown Lyrics
by Virtuoso.

Virtuoso.
Yo, I be attestin' bad you soon discover I'm the best around.
Virtuoso omnipotent medulla rule the extra crowds.
Step in battles weapon-rals give ya chest a pound.
'til ya breast is ground meat.
Pharaohs Army sound fleet.
Snatch ahold of half ya soul make, casserole.
Crack a pole on ya back and roll you in the blackest hole.
The winter brewed, enter nude Amazonian jungle warfare.
Silver back guerilla I'm covered in more hair.
Than four chairs in a barber shop.
Vocals hard as rocks and the beat's on smash.
Make ya veto, jigga weak foe.
Cause my machete unique flow fuckin' beat yo ass.
I got the key to sense or hear a deer sharp as fox.
Sound as when carver chop, galaxies and stars'll drop.
You know Virt, run with ogres who throw dirt.
Stomp ya ass 'til ya bones squirt like yogurt.

T-Ruckus.
Aiyyo rush extreme pervert, I'm undercover covert.
You need to put in work, and get ya games out my face.
Let the flames in the place, you fuckin' wid Ruck's a fatal move.
You stand in disgrace yo my brain's in outerspace.
Taste the toxic, improved reflexes like shadowboxin'.
Sternum crack, extreme force applied to ya back.
Pick ya torture that's the rack.
I'll scortch ya with the lift.
And word style I clash like,  with full clips.
Guerilla war I killed ya core.
Atilla the Hun don't want none.
I'' bash your fuckin' head into the floor.
Spittin' shots through ya door, and kick that bitch down.
From the bowel, where Ruck throws the mic to the ground.
In discussin' Ruck you trust, word to us.
You spittin' the shit we flush time to bust.
And crack the earth's crust with one thrust.
Nasty as shit, toxic the hazardous, analyst.

I got it locked from the 2-1 pound to beantown.
From Philly to Boston we tossin' cats to the ground.
Then some clown jumps up to get beatdown.
Virtuoso, T-Ruckus, Jedi Mind for the crown.
I got it locked from the 2-1 pound to beantown.
We cats that speak growls to blast ya weak sound.
Then some clown jumps up to get beatdown.
Big Virt, Ruckus, Jedi bring the beatdown.

Vinnie Paz a.k.a Ikon.
Prepare for the blitzkrieg, ya wrist.
bleed into six seas.
Ya veinless, my stainless will split trees.
The fist need to smash through the brain.
Soul of the chauvanist cast into the flame.
You'll come to learn that my flesh is unslashable.
You damn coward ya man power is laughable ya chest blastable.
The chaplain'll smash you in the adam's apple.
For not doin' what's asked of you.
That's the last of you, I'm a sick.
bastard.
I spit gases and split rappers wid pick axes.
From Illadelph Shambala to Los Angeles.
Rappers are mummified from the number of bandages that I inflicted.

With guillotine swiftness.
We mean vicious and fiends can get they spleen shifted.

Jus Allah a.k.a Megatron.
Jus Allah and Vinnie Paz, leave ya.
flags raised at half mast.
Let the fuck off wid less crimes than fuckin' cats.
The wrath, leavin' you outside and jacked.
Then we drop more shells than pregnant crabs.
The Glock make motherfuckas bow down in hell.
You opened immediate, like priority.
mail.
That's my dog and I clean up after his tail.
So the evidence can't pin the god in jail.
Leavin' you peeled, buried in an underground cell.
While your family still hopin' you alive and well.
Call the Reaper, tell him I got, lives for sale.
I'm paid for each motherfucka supplied to hell.
I can tell y'all can provide work for me.
Motherfucka like Hercules versus Freddy Mercury.
Virtuoso pass the blunt.
And let Megatron smoke these trees down to stumps.
