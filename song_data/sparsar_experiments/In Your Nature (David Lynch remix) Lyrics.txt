In Your Nature (David Lynch remix) Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

Eyes above me.
Eyes are blown.
And now just when the wall becomes a hole.
I don't want to know.

... the ground is shaking.
Out of realm.
A hunted world.
Where it never shows.
I don't want to go.

I feel it forming.
Through the skin.
Swallow me whole.
Let it bury me in.
And there i go.

It's coming down.
Like a sharp.
Curve in the sky.
And i don't even know why.

If it's in your nature you'll never win.

It used to be that.
The war was brought.
But now the end becomes us again.
We never let it in.

And in the shadows.
A burning light.
It's getting deeper for the fight.

So run off run off.
Let it drip down you.
Run off run off.
Like it was born for you.

If it's in your nature you'll never win.

And then you go down that old regarded road.
And i'm not the one to say i told you so.
And you know.
Oh you know.

If it's in your nature you'll never win.
