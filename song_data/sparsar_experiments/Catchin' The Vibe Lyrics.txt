Catchin' The Vibe Lyrics
by Quasimoto.


Ay yo the other day some nigga hit me up.
Said yo what you got left.
Cuz he heard mad shit, he tried to put me to the test.
I lay like 150 more styles on him.
I was flipping mad taste,.
spitting shit out like phlegm.
He couldn't even understand the progress.
I was smoking on the criz.
While he lit up the stress.
No more, when that shit touch my chest.
Always got the orange hairs when it's time to bless.
I guess, that's why I'm always on a higher plane.
To gain past the wealth and fame.
Why niggas always pushing on mental rights.
I straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.

Why niggas always pushing on mental rights.
I straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.
Why niggas always pushing on mental rights.
I straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.
I straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.
Manifest, I be catching the vibe.
Why niggas always pushing on mental rights.
Straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.

Ay yo, I keep it butter while you're artificial flavor.
Even though I'm independent and your label is a major.
Your watered down status sound like you're Johnny Mathis.
Only one album and already your path is the wrong one.
While I be on the strong one, you'll be in for a long one.
I hit this bong one, time, picture vibe, why you can't?
Cuz you keep it phony like Kevin Mahoney.
Strikes champs I be strictly trying to blow out your amp.
On the buzz bye, the ill loop digga man.

Why niggas always pushing on mental rights.
I straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.
Why niggas always pushing on mental rights.
I straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.
I straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.
Manifest, I be catching the vibe.
Why niggas always pushing on mental rights.
Straight manifest, I be catching the vibe.
I be catching the vibe....
