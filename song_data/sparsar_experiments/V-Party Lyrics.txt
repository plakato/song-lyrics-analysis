V-Party Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


What's that in my crib?
A party!
House so big, that's gnarly.
Whip game party, wrist game party, rich game party.
Insane party!

I pulled up to my party, in my new Ferrari.
What's this in my water?
Shit this must be molly.
This bitch is hella drunk, she lookin' hella sorry.
Rich chandelier, r-r-retarded.
Who's knockin' at the door?
Hugh Hefner!

Party goin' crazy, who could do it better?
Bitch you ain't invited, unless you gettin' cheddar.
This bitch is hella wet, so bring an umbrella.
Whole street blocked off - traffic.
This is my party! - r-ratchet.
Shit you never seen - magic.

Don't sit on my couch!
That's Versace fabric.
I ? in Liberace, bitches snortin' ?
This ain't once a month, bitch we do this all the time.
I walked into my room, bitches butt-naked.
Party, party, party, let's all get wasted!

Party! At my residence.
Everybody here, we even got the president.
You ain't at my party, bitch you irrelevant.
Rockstar wasted, bitch we hella bent.
Speakers so loud, we blowin' out the windows.
? this party ?, they blowin' out the ?

Runnin' trains on a bitch, monkey in the middle.
All hoes suckin' dick, Nintendo.
It's my party, I'll get high if I want to.
You ain't my bitch, so you know I don't want you.
? off drank, ooh I caught you!

Said you want another shot?
Well my bartender ain't got you.
Be mad if you wan't to.
Bitch I'm a party animal!
Bitches eatin' bitches out, cannibal.

Five-o at the party.
That's not understandable.
They was at the door, I let 'em in.
I got manners, too!
