Caroline Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

I can remember, I can remember a time of beginning to relate.
To who you are, who you really are.
Never look back cause we've come so far.
There's a place I can never return so I decide to let it burn.
Far away is where I'd rather be than to see that look upon your face.
Our love is all around here.
She goes away just to be near.
Caroline, tell me why you wanna leave this way?
Caroline, tell me where you gonna go this time?
Cause all we are is all we are and now it's up to you.
Caroline, we'll find a place that makes you feel apart.
Well, it gets you high and makes you feel the possibility.
And who you really are, who you really are.
Never look back cause we've come so far.
There's a place I can never return and from here you'll start tonight.
Our love is all around here.
She goes away just to be near.
Caroline, tell me why you wanna leave this way?
Caroline, tell me where you gonna go tonight?
Cause all we are is all we are and there's no reason why.
Cause all we are is all we are, don't let it go to waste.
Don't you let it go to waste, don't you ever go away.
