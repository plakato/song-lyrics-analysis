Baron Samedi Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


You will encounter everything you fear;.
Violence, Darkness, Helplessnessâ€¦
How many lives will you destroy in pursuit of what you call justice?

They don't want to see this sort of nigga, what's ya purpose, I be on the move.
I'm different, really I don't need it all, so nigga, I don't really got to.
prove.
Nothin' I will get to bussin', I really don't wanna hear no kind of fussin'.
If ya get to bluffin', I will call ya bluff and leave ya mama knowin' what it.
feels to lose, nigga.
Slurrin' like I was just poppin' off of that bottle of Jack Danielsan.
Wax on, wax off, give me that weed nigga, cigar and rum.
Ya told me you wanted that turn up nigga that's hardly fun.
Gettin' hella faded, now a nigga lookin' like he's so Bacardi done.
Ritualism admitted, I might get a little creepy to some but.
Never pass judgement, how in the world I was penny pinchin' with you dumb fuck.
Put a curse in you and make it worse for you so everywhere you go you lumped.
up.
Any of you never have a friend and put ya body parts up in a dump truck.
Reincarnated, I'm Baron comin' in to kill 'em all.
I don't ever wanna stop until I see bloodstains on the wall.
Kill or be killed nigga, you make the call.
Pull out the chainsaw and slice right through his jaw.
Any time you bring a demon in it, you will always find a nigga lurkin'.
The serpent, slippin' my dick up inside the beef curtains.

Who you think is gon' be first in line to put the work in?
And pullin' off and leave a motherfucka layin' hurtin'.
I just really wanna know exactly what's ya purpose.
won't you have a nigga bring them to the grave.
Come with me in the middle of the full moonlight.
Say goodnight to the motherfucker because in the end they always will pay.
Baron Samedi.

If you wanna put a fuckin' body.
In this bitch, you gotta pay me.
If you wanna keep that nigga soul.
I need blood, gotta pay me.
Catch a nigga diggin' ditches.
In the back yard like it's nothin'.
Ain't sacrificed nothin'.
But Brainsick niggas need somethin'.

I be really doin' voodoo, won't you come in here and fuckin' take a seat?
Got a fancy for the necromancy, lookin' for the candy up under the sheet.

I cut you all up into pieces so mind your business 'fore you're on my table.
as a feast, nigga.
Die Hard like Bruce Willis but homie, I would never play with ya.
Imagine me up in the cemetery with a shovel, scoopin' like a grave digger.

Movin' like I'm an assassin, I'm a professor like I was Xavier.
Savior, and I ain't ever gotta ask a bitch if it's okay with her.
Dancin' around that fire, lookin' like I am wild, but it's really Voodoo.

I can only imagine what people think about a nigga like I'm really cuckoo.

Yeah, nigga, Shaka Zulu!
Niggas be wolfin' all up on the internet, in person they run away and drop.
doo-doos.
I'm Baron, nigga, why you starin' at me, with a cane and black hat.
I be really into black magic, don't need no black cat.
I be try'na tell that mothafucka for years so don't be lookin' at a nigga.
surprised when you hear that brrat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat.
Put a curse up on you, somethin' simple, I don't know, like a nose bleed.
Could be unbearable, the pain that you feel in your brain and your dome piece.

When they pull up on you, hop out with the badge and say Freeze.
NWA nigga, still Fuck tha Police!
Straight from South East, they gon'.
?Run and get bang out, green strains, got?
Nothin' for me to put the price on your neck.
The most evil of all Loa when I strike like a boa.
And I promise you and your family that I will bring you all death.
Baron Samedi!
