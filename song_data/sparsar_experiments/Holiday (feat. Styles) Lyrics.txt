Holiday (feat. Styles) Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


Yeah.
L O X nigga.
It don't stop.
It keep goin, and goin, and goin, and goin.
Motherf**kers.

You heard it from the P, you oughta know it's the truth.
I get you kidnapped and raped and thrown off a roof.
You could nod your head to this like it's only a rap.
Cause when these bullets hit your ass I'm like it's only a gat.
I need a funeral to feel god, I'm hopin it's yours.
Think you religious, heard he got shot in the cross.
Holiday Styles, bitch I broke most of the laws.
F**k with the poor, so flip to the boots, stick to the truth.
Do anything it takes just to get to this loot!
And missin a tooth, but both of 'em chipped, told you the script.
You heard about the trouble, I start most of the shit.
When I squeeze ain't no controllin the wrist.
And niggas leave the room when the hear the P flowin with swiss.
I'm an ignorant and negative nigga.
I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas.
You think not, I'll look at your man and level a nigga.
If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name.
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame.
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call.
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than y'all.
If I left the gun home, I'ma give you the sword.
I'm the devil in the flesh, I can't give you the Lord.
It don't make no sense for you to pray for your life.
I got my niggas in the crib, you oughta pray for your wife.

I gotta make it to heaven for goin through hell.

And I don't care if I sell, y'all know what I sell.

I use my left hand when I'm loadin the shells.

S: cause I know it ain't right, that's why I'm blowin a L.

Yo, I do it all for my niggas, even ride wit a bomb.
Get shot, die in his arm, and give him my last.
It's a million dollar bail, I'ma get it in cash.
I sell crack like it's '88, I live in the past.
You know the P carry the gun, live in the mask.
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash.
I like malibu and pineapple, fifty's of hash.
Hundred's of dro, wear my clothes a week in a row.
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the door.
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for.
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard.
But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car.
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard.
Gettin jewels from the old timers, stashin the cards.
But jail ain't part of the plans.
I keep weight on the scale cause I feel I get further with grams.
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars.
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up.
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut.
I don't deal with the snakes and fakes.
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes.
Double R now bitch you oughta know I'ma ghost.
Blow up your face, blow up the coke, and blow up the smoke.
