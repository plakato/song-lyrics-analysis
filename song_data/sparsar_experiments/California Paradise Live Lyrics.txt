California Paradise Live Lyrics
by The Runaways.

Turn up that radio.
Hear the rock and roll.
Malibu shines like summer gold.
Wild beaches.
In the salty wind.
California summers never end.
California - you're so nice.
California - your paradise.
The kids are ripping up the streets.
In their super cars.
All night parties and loud guitars.
Hot hot neighbourhoods.
Its the silver sound.
Wicked Hollywood goes round and round.
California - you're so nice.
California - your paradise.
