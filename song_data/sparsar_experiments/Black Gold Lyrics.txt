Black Gold Lyrics
by Running Wild.

The world is on fire, hunting for oil.
A handful of liars dividing the spoils.

Bullshit is walking with a whole bunch of lies.
When money is talking, reality dies.

Pre:.
They came with a lie, feeding their pile.
Souls' gonna die, they're addicted to win.
Selling wrong for right enlarging their file.
Boneheaded games, triumph of sin.

Black gold, stuck to their veins.
Black gold, they're running insane.
Black gold, blood on their hands.
Black gold, life's got no chance.
Black gold.

Raking in money the evil to praise.
Licking its honey hellfire to face.

Black gold, goes up in smoke.
Black gold, children to choke.
Black gold.
