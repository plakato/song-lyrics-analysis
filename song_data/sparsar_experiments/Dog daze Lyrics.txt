Dog daze Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Trippin' on the serials.
Surfing next to criminals.
My mind feels the pull.

Independent soldiers.
With confidential owners.
My mind feels the pull.

When you and me together.
Means you and me forever.
My mind feels the pull.

When everything is certain.
And the ocean smells of nonsense.
My mind feels the pull.

Even when we fall away.

I don't need your money.
And I don't need you pull.
It's so easy to fake what's easily sold.

Even when we fall away I'm home.
