Adding To The Noise Lyrics
by Switchfoot.

Spoken:.
One two.

What's it gonna take to slow us down to let the silence spin us around?
What's it gonna take to drop this town?
We've been spinning at the speed of sound.

Stepping out of those convenience stores.
What could we we want but more more more?
Form the third world to the corporate core we are the symphony of modern.
humanity.
Yeah.

If we're adding to the noise turn off this song.
If we're adding to the noise turn off your stereo, radio, video....

I don't know what they're gonna think of next genetic engineers of the most.
high tech.
A couple new ways to fall into debt.
I'm a nervous wreck but I'll bet that that T.V. set tells us what we've wanted.
to hear.
But none of these sound bites are coming in clear:.
From the third world to the corporate ear we are the symphony of modern.
humanity.
Yeah.

If we're adding to the noise.
Turn off this song.
If we're adding to the noise.
Turn off your stereo, radio,....

If we're adding to the noise.
Turn off this song.
If we're adding to the noise.
Turn off your stereo, radio....
Stereo, radio…
Stereo, radio…
Stereo, radio…

If we're adding to the noise.
Turn off this song.
If we're adding to the noise.
Turn off your stereo, radio....

If we're adding to the noise.
If we're adding to the noise.
If we're adding to the noise.
Turn off this song.
