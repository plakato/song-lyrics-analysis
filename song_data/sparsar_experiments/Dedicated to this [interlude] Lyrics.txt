Dedicated to this [interlude] Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


I only express my feelings with a french kiss.
Real rappers that's the only thing that I miss.
Fuck these other rappers they never the shit, they be taking a piss.
This ain't not diss my nigga.
But anyway, your porshe was rented and your bimmer was on lease.
So tell me what you stunting with? nigga please.
I'm tryina multiply my hustle so that my money will increase.
I pray we run into each other.
Coz you never in my raider.
Girls now losing feelings because I never call them first.
Unless we are together.
I'm definitely in my zone but Jay row another.
I'm always high because I'm tryna catch up with my mother.
So if you ain't talking what I'm talking.
Or reppin what I'm reppin, nigga please don't bother.
I'm kinda married to the game and I pray we will never divorce each other.
Fuck a new year resolution everyday I'm tryna find a new solution.

Put your middle fingers high yeahhh.
Tell the hater, he a fuckin liar yeahhh.
