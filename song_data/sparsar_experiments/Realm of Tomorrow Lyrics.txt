Realm of Tomorrow Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

Oh how it shines....
Pried from the fingers of a dead man.
Frozen in time of suicide.
In death his hand still clutched the weapon.
Body betraying the mind.

Steel racing through flesh, onto the next victim.
Feel the power, spill forth from hell ascended.
Sing with no regret, reduce the threat to nothing.
Slave to the sword.

Journey on.
Unto the realm of tomorrow.
Journey on.
Only the brave dare to follow.
Journey on.
To meld the soul with the steel.
Journey on.
No other way to be free.

Can't stop, even if he wanted to.
Can't stop, not until he dies.

He'll feel the peril and the pain, offered by wielding evil's bane.
As all who perish by his hand, combine to make a darker man.
Sinister visions cloud his mind, his heart turns quick to dark from light.

Onward into the abyss.
Now what's left?
On the Plains of Aramethea.
Slaughtered them all.
Consummate this wicked union.

Now, conquered the world.
Just one more life left to take...mine.

Soon he'll learn the truth, he's been used for slaughter.
Deathbringer is bleeding his soul dry.
