Arrow of Time Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.


What will you do when it's right up on you.
Like a ring of fire.
Why ask why? Don't need to justify.
Who really cares anyway?

Ethical tragedy.
Rabid humanity.
Learn from our past so they say.

Now is the time.
To make up your mind.
And find out what is real.
Fight or flight.
You can't run.
You can't run from yourself.

One reason to survive.
With a thousand ways to die.
When you're living on the wire.
Reaching the threshold.
Near system overload.
Caught on the red-eye again.

Close your eyes.
And hear the voices in your head.
Grand disguise.
This mass confusion.
Revered Illusion.

Some grip the mast on their final descent.
Into the darkness below.
Others will kick and crawl their way out.
There is no heaven below.

You can't run.

From the arrow of time.
