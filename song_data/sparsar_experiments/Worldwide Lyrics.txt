Worldwide Lyrics
by Tyler Tracey.


When everyone told me that I could never be.
The dreams that I see, you know what this means.
I got my middle finger up, my crew by my side.
We taking this globally, we going worldwide.

Now it's been a while since I felt this confident.
Last time I was so young, hadn't experienced life yet.
Hadn't had time to forget.
Then things got heavy and I was ready to quit.
Ready to give up on it all and say To Hell with it.
I don't need this shit, fuck it all and end it.
But I'm glad I didn't do it, I took it out on my music.
And my family, we a unit and I didn't know that and I abused it.
But I understand what we are now and I thank God I didn't lose it.
And Imma take that pain I felt as fuel and God damn it Imma use it.
Light a match under my ass because shit is just warming up.
Since I left my old life, I've been happy and you can say it was luck.
Or will power or whatever but I'm back and stronger than ever.
As long as my team and my family behind me I'll push through the storm and the.
weather.
Darkness can still be success, you just need a light.
And fight with all your might and aim for all new heights.
That's what Imma do to make sure I enjoy this ride.
So I'll be smiling the day I know I'll have gone worldwide.

When everyone told me that I could never be.
The dreams that I see, you know what this means.
I got my middle finger up, my crew by my side.
We taking this globally, we going worldwide X2.
We going worldwide, I said we going worldwide.
We taking this globally, we going world wide.
I got my middle finger up, my crew by my side.
We taking this globally, we going worldwide.

I still remember all those nasty things, I still know the harness life brings.
But I won't let it take everything I won't let it take all these things.
That I've worked so hard to accomplish because I rose up through the darkness.
Came out into the bright light to show the whole world I'm a true artist.
I'm a survivor like Eminem in Call Of Duty so even if I walk up on stage and.
everyone boos me.
I'll take it as a stepping stone in my life because this is my moment to lose.
myself in the limelight.
Motherfuckers you can't bring me down.
I'm the hardest working MC around.
Keep my name in your mouth but don't spit because Imma spit the illest shit.
You ever heard in your whole careers of judging everyone's God given talents.
I've been blessed with this gift to rhyme and spit my story in these lines.
And last time I let you get inside my mind but I'm going for the glory, you.
can't hurt me this time.
I said you can't hurt me this time because I left all your hate behind.
I'm on the latter to another level and damn right I was born to climb.
So when they bury me in that box and it's the last home I'll reside.

yeah.

When everyone told me that I could never be.
The dreams that I see, you know what this means.
I got my middle finger up, my crew by my side.
We taking this globally, we going worldwide X2.
We going worldwide, I said we going worldwide.
We taking this globally, we going world wide.
I got my middle finger up, my crew by my side.
We taking this globally, we going worldwide.

Interlude:.
Yeah, thank you to everyone who's held me down and supported me since day one.
I appreciate you all.

When everyone told me that I could never be.
The dreams that I see, you know what this means.
I got my middle finger up, my crew by my side.
We taking this globally, we going worldwide.
