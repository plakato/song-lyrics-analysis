Bitchassness Lyrics
by Swifty McVay.

They never love you nigga!

It was some niggas from Iron Fist.
That dissed us on a track.
And when I called them.
You woulda thought them niggas do Christian rap.
Now this is fact.
Remember Dirty Harry signed.
you.
On a dotted line.
And when he died, you was crying, dude.
Ya took advantage of his heart.
Be mindful.
You walked in this bitch.
Blindfolded, and now behind closed.
Doors, what the fuck you cared about we chasing whores?
And he's Proof, established his life and tried to give you yours.
Y'all niggas ain't even sork shit, you ain't here to brother.
When he talked, when Em were near, it came out the other.
And on tour, y'all was humble as some puppies.
You didn't know rap, some hood flunkies that got lucky.
And all the fuck you ever was good fo' was hitting hoes.
That's the winner's attention, it wasn't genuine known.
One of you niggas hated on Dolo, you bastard fuck!
The other tried to sue Proof, they wouldn't give his masses up.
But you gon' take it to Shady, and try to ask for bucks?!
That's why the too lureless niggas got they asses up.
Outta there, G-Flame and Famous, yeah they knew the game.
On why the mug this they try to gain fame off his name.
Claiming y'all been doing this for Proof.
But ain't nothing changed.
And now you argue with his wife.
About the kids' estate.
I knew it was something strange.
But I can say that I'm positive that.
Big homie is spinning in his grave.
You bitches!

There's only one type of nigga.
That'll do the shit that you did.
And that's a bitch! That's a bitch.
And that's a bitch, bitchassness.
There's only one type of nigga.
That'll take from a dead man's kids.
And that's a bitch! That's a bitch.
And that's a bitch, bitchassness.
