Now I wanna know who's in the motherfucking house!
Is Queens in tha house?!

Roll up da philly, we getting silly.
In graffitti lofts chilling on chilli rocks, just really.
Only young knocks out on the look out for cops.
In these spots We watch, talk, drop.
Lots of conscious, lyrically accomplish.
\- Complicated interlectual content.
Share ya company from Z to compton.
Stop the narrative, this is native to y'all.
Scene: a big party which bitches, Q and lamar.
Styro-cup, don't give a fuck about your „I-know stuff“.
Eye-go-not so ironically inside your psych-oh-Uhhm.-.
I don't know why I do smoke so much. Take a toke is lust.
But tonight I'm getting high like I am so in-luck.
Yea I'll toke a lot, crack a morgan open like coconut.
Roll- a blunt and get so in-touch with Emily.
Your best friend may be your enemy. Who's got stuff?
\- Put it up, baby push it up, you sitting weird though.
I'm in the truck, she gimme fuck, I'm speaking weird though.
„What a weirdo, he's like so for-real gross“.
But reckoning that you subbed to me, shows you got an ear for me though.
For me these egos and machos are very muchos.
Not my secundos, they're unos, who don't know my Judo.
Muchas Gracias, I learned that shit on Sesame.
Don't know what the fuck is up with me, I act so recklessly.
First crashed my car in a tree and now I killed Stephany.
She was another girl who once ago had slept with me.
\- Just saw a cow shoot down the deputy.
What the fuck is up, where's the party and where is Stephany?
I think I'm credibly so incredibly high right now.
I believe I can fly right now.
I'm in the sky zone, high zone, lost in the mist above me –.
This for my NY peeps living like Big Lebowski.
