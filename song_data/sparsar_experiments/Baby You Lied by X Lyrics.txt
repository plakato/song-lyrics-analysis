Baby You Lied by X Lyrics
by X.

You got lost in the dark last night.
The road was empty.
Sittin' in your car you saw a black and white.
Doin' a hundred and twenty.
Baby, you lied when you loved me.
To you the whole thing was a fake.
And now you're stuck out in the wilderness.
In the middle of a big mistake.
Baby, you lied, I even understand why.
I'm lookin' at a candy bar you left behind.
I'll make you be forgiven.
Baby, you lied.
You smelled like shit this mornin'.
But refused to crawl back home.
A black snake never moves backwards.
You both will spend your life alone.
Baby, you lied when you left me.
Another line in your private joke.
I hope you had a good time watchin'.
Your life go up in smoke.
Baby, you lied, I even understand why.
I'm watchin' a musical monkey unwind.
Hopin' to be forgiven.
Baby, you lied.
Your car broke down, you sat for an hour.
Chewin' on your hand.
You fix it yourself, it's not your fault.
That the world is so unfair.
Baby, you lied on Sunday.
Workin' on the day of rest.
The fact that I could lead you.
Proves that you're no best.
Baby, you lied, I even understand why.
Lipstick and Gideon's, runaway signs.
Wasted livin'.
Baby, you lied. Uh, baby, you lied. Baby, you lied.
