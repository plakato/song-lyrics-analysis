Perfect Day - feat. Anuhea [Full Version] Lyrics
by Awa.

My perfect day would be you in my arms.
Watching the sunrise.
Feel mellow sun rays slipping through the palms.
Echoing your design.
Sharing our dreams.
Free and naive.
While drifting deeper into your eyes.
Make love to me, my baby.
And tell me you'll forever be mine.
Me tātari tonu māua'.
I te āio o te aroha.
Kia kotahi ai te wairua.
Mo āke tonu.
If there's one thing I know.
You are my only.
You have my heart.
My love will never roam.
It will never fade away.
You're my perfect day.
Anuhea.
My perfect day would be in your arms.
Watching the birds fly by.
Hearing sweet melodies.
Vibin' through the sky.
Singing a love song for you and me.
Sharing our dreams.
Letting time slip away.
Tell me is this love that I'm feeling?.
Show love to me, my honey.
And tell me, and tell me you'll forever be mine.
He aloha wela  ko'u mai ke Akua mai la.
Komo 'oe i loko o ko'u moe 'uhane.
He la hemolele kēia'.
Aia au ma na lani.
Anuhea.
Today is ours and no one else's.
I thank the Lord for all His blessings.
Mahalo ke Akua no kēia la.
Awa.
You're my symphony and I wanna listen.
Solely my purpose for living.
Toku whaiāipo, haere mai.
Anuhea.
And I don't even wanna try.
To be with another guy.
My baby, you're perfect to me.
So to you, this song I sing.
Awa.
Me tātari tonu māua'.
I te āio o te aroha.
Anuhea.
He la hemolele kēia'.
Aia au ma na lani.
