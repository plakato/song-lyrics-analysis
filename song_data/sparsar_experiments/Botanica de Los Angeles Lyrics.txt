Botanica de Los Angeles Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.


You should have known.
Yet unashamed.
That there's no way.
To save.
Your wasted flower of youth.
But you feel the same.
In spite of all he did to you.

Sweet heart cut up face.
That I would have died any number of times for.
Beat down and beat down.
So peculiar so beloved.

Don't look away.
Be rough on the weak.
True love ought not wait.
But has.
The pistol is raised to your lips.
The feel of a kiss is gone.
Gone as soon as it ends.

Sweet face busted teeth.
That I would have died any number of times with.
Slapped around like a clown.
So peculiar so beloved.

Hyunhye dead.
Kathleen dead.
Molly dead.
Natasia dead.
Denise dead.
Mylinh dead.
Mimi dead.
Jessica dead.
