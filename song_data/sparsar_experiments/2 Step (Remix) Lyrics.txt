T-Pain.
Ay, you know my bank roll , got a lot of zero's.
Teddy Pain , the Tallahassee hero.
I done got a crib , now I'm in The A.
2 Steppin lemme show you how I do this thang.
Take yo left foot, put it out in the front.
And do it - mmmmmerrrrrrrrrahh...like this.
Now if you look around the club, you would notice cain't nobody do it.
Qui....iiiiiiite - like this.
Ay! Shades on, dem Oakley's to be exact.
Now when I sang my song, I'mma bring dem hoes in the back.
And you know, I'm the hottest nigga 'round!
So when I get 'em up to my room, I got 'em countin me down, let's get.

DJ Unk.
{4..} Steppin to the right, wipe me down manye.
{3...} Steppin to the left, with yer stunna frames.
{2...} By this time the WORLD know what to do.
It's goin down 2 Steppin REMIX! Unk, what it do?
I'm back one mo' geeeen, wit another one.
2 Steppin, gettin jiggy baby have some fun.
They said it couldn't be dooooone, I guess I got it crackin.
2 Steppin, ay bay-BAY.
Now gawn n get it shawty, the charts I climb back on.
One-hit wonder, bet dey wonder how I do it all.
They got dey steps wrooooong, dey try to bite mine.
Let's see what's hap'nin when I count down, one more time - GO.

Money's on the fadeaway.
NYC, you know how we do it.

Jim Jones.
Now catch us 2 Steppin, I got my goons reppin.
We turn the VIP into the do it, do it section.
You know the jewel selection , I'm blue VVS'in.
We ain't gon' talk about the whips, you know the Coupe selection.

And I got everything that you want , I'm registered to Dupont.

I get bread like croutons , I make dough like crouissants.
I'm Grey Poupon , Bentley shit baby.
What the fuck is you on?  It's how I'm livin' lady.
Like Queens call the car dealer then the Girbaud dealer.
Now we out at Vegas, poker face with the card dealer.
The hard nigga , gone off the hard liquor.
You better watch your ass when them foreign cars wheel up.

Official remix! Official remix!
Official remix! eeRRRRRAH!

E-40.
I'm in my Cutlass on two shoes.
Breakin all the rules.
Two hitters manye two fools!
Two hammers manye two 2's!
Shinin like a chandelier.
Diamonds up in my ear.
Sick Wid It trophy on my neck, I dang near wear it everywhere.
Too much candy on my ride.
Too many rumors I done died.
Too many haters on this Earth.
All my life it ain't been certs.
Started off real small.
But now my mail is tall.
Had to walk before I crawled.
I had my back against the wall.
Two faces not us, two faces at once, grittin it gettin it in.
Hustlers R Us, never no punk, I'll 2 Step on yo' chin.
I see some broads.
2 steppin' by they lonesome.
These square suckers they actin' like they don't wanna.
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know!
You gotta find 'em doe, send 'em doe, break 'em doooooe-oooh.
You gotta get the dough, get the dough, get the dough.
I mean get it manye rain, shine, sleet, or snooooow-oooh.
See I managed wit it , I get jiggy wit it.
Eh-ha ha!
ERRRUGH!
