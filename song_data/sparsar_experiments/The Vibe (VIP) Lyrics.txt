The Vibe (VIP) Lyrics
by The Yung Fusion.


I be that young rapping dude.
Might just trap with you.
Coming with the thunder baby.
Might just clap ya' crew.
I roll out in the morning light.
Whip that Harley bike.
All black, i'm the party type.
-and it's on tonight.
I just stepped no weapons.
But my outfit might take ya soul.
See my presence impressive.
Got strippers slipping off of poles.
I just whip then I swerve em.
Wish you would i'm Timmy Tuner.
Turned her to a carnivore.
Now she treat me like a burger.

I don't their names but, they all wanna ride.
All this energy around me, I feel so alive.
This must be the vibes x3.
Cause I feel so alive.

I got a fresh cut in the denims.
All these sexy genes in my section.
And if a nigga wanna run up.
Boy get done up by the Confessor damn.
Slide into yo DM's in the pm and am.
Then I slide into your feelings.
When you see just what I'm saying.
I ain't ever tryna front.
Imma' show you girl wassup.
You can show me what is love.
Then we ride of in the sun.
Damn, this must be movie cause we directing the fun.
And producing weekend music.
But the credits never come.

Speakers popping like soda.
Make em turn up and over.
I'm the slickest in here.
Thats why she kissing the cobra.
And I feel so alive.
All these girls going wild.
And its all in my jungle.
I see they all feeling vibes.
So bring yo girl.
