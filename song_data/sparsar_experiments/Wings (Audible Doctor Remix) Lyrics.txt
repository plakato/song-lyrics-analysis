Wings (Audible Doctor Remix) Lyrics
by The Union.

Produced by The Audible Doctor.

Yeah, yeah don't even try to ask me when I'm coming down.
Nah, nah I ain't wasting time beneath these sinking clouds.
Nah, nah why would I settle for less than the crown.
Uh, uh when I'm over your head watch as I leave the ground.
Yeah don't even try to ask me when I'm coming down.
Nah, nah I ain't wasting time beneath these sinking clouds.
Nah, nah why would I settle for less than the crown.
Uh, uh when I'm over your head watch as I leave the ground.

The Audible Doctor.
Step outta my spaceship like you damn dirty apes can take this.
Middle finger to the bringers of the fake shit.
You feel the pain when I deliver like a taint rip.
With styles so fat it's been known to break hips.
I fuck with beats so hard the break will need a rape kit.
And ain't shit I can say I was made to make hits.
Doc get 'em out of they seat like when a plane dips.
Claiming they contain heavy metal like eating paint chips.
Fuck it cuz I'm above it where the oxygen stops.
I'm trying to go pop like astronauts removing their top.
I'm proving any song you drop, it'll probably flop.
Cut a rapper short like he represent the guild of the lollypop.
In this field you body rock or you'll probably lose them.
Shit ain't real it's all about hits and mass confusion.
My DJ's got terror wrists and knows how to use them.
And bitch I'm guaranteed to knock your socks off like a shoe bomb.

Yeah, yeah don't even try to ask me when I'm coming down.
Nah, nah I ain't wasting time beneath these sinking clouds.
Nah, nah why would I settle for less than the crown.
Uh, uh when I'm over your head watch as I leave the ground.
Yeah don't even try to ask me when I'm coming down.
Nah, nah I ain't wasting time beneath these sinking clouds.
Nah, nah why would I settle for less than the crown.
Uh, uh when I'm over your head watch as I leave the ground.

Yo, Elzhi's in the building.
The Union's in the building.
Analogtronics, hot shit, yeah.

Puffin' on cigars got me high as planet Mars.
Every blue moon I get to mingle with the stars.
I toke the buddha, may choke the ruger.
I warn you if you download this make smoke computers.
El will prevail.
Now put that on the Glock shell bitches on my jock trail.
I knocked, when their socks fell.
Rhyme writer, tighter than a locked jail block cell.
For spittin' molotov cocktails.
Straighten the rumors, speculators consumers and late bloomers create tumors.
If they ain't consumers of my numerous.
Material built for your stereo to pack fanatics, flyer than aerial acrobatics.
Cause what I bust, crush your hopes and dreams.
Shoot the gift as if it came with scopes and beams.
Haters wanna' tie me down like ropes and strings.
But I'm about blings, slingin' dope and flings, wings.

Yeah, yeah don't even try to ask me when I'm coming down.
Nah, nah I ain't wasting time beneath these sinking clouds.
Nah, nah why would I settle for less than the crown.
Uh, uh when I'm over your head watch as I leave the ground.
Yeah don't even try to ask me when I'm coming down.
Nah, nah I ain't wasting time beneath these sinking clouds.
Nah, nah why would I settle for less than the crown.
Uh, uh when I'm over your head watch as I leave the ground.
