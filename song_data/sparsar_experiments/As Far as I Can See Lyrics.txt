As Far as I Can See Lyrics
by The Zombies.

There's a slow train coming.
From the distance coming.
As far as I can see.

From a blue horizon.
That I keep my eyes on.
And I search constantly.

Let it come.

There's a safe house waiting.
That I know is waiting.
Some way down the line.

And I can't quite see there.
Though some day I'll be there.
And I look for the sign.

Let it shine.

Only as far as I can see.
