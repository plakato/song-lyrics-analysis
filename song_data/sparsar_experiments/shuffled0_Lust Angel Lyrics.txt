Lust Angel Lyrics
by NuLOVE.

Damn, thats how that shit go. Girl you walk around this bitch.
Nevermind, just give me top while I'm getting high as a satellite.
I promise you a substitute will do the kama sutra that you don't.
I thought you had a halo but I can see your horns.

Acting like a misfit looking for a strip pole.
Acting like a misfit looking for a strip hole..
But  you're delusional. Thinking you, the wifey type.
From your parents, but instead you drinking liquor with niggas.
Lying that we loving you, but lord knows that you bluffin too.
With that blue dream inside it, but you ain't touching my weed.

And that's cool, I'm just hoping that they're using protection.
You swore you'd make up for every single party you missed.
I heard your momma barely ever let you out the house.
Are you down to go? Its up to you.
Whenever you through with that sex you get disowned.
For your sake, just think; Do you know who the F that they're F'ing?

Seventeen, lit candles on that birthday cake.
But now that you're finally of age theres no more round-a-bouts.
We play Russian Roulette with sex pistols.
You can have whatever you want, I won't tell nobody if you won't.
Sip Bacardi, throwing dollars, you gon' probably strip.
You about to call up your ex and get thrizzowed.
The moment that you take'em off is when you'll be ignored.
Throw back a couple of shots but  really there's no need to keep a score.
I don't know about that train shit, that pussy is wreckage.
Girl you a Vixen, Santa deer on Christmas.
And we puffin too. My memory prolly won't be restored.
But whatever, cause I'm having a goodtime, listen.
Damn, thats how that shit go. Girl you walk around this bitch.

Every time that come around, you on a niggas wishlist I'm serious.
You play Russian Roulette with sex pistols.
