Ugly Lyrics
by XP.


Ugly nigga when I say the shit bitch I'm so legit.
When life gives you lemons, kick him right in his fucking dick.
See me and ugly, that shits a synonym.
If it's hard to swallow, choke it down with some cinnamon.
Suicidal thoughts, walking though these empty halls.
This ain't me trippin' it's more like a seven story fall.
Accept the weird in fact, locked him in a tire rack.
All you niggas weirder than white kids wearing fitted hats.
They wanna crucify a nigga but won't dignify a visit.
To my mind-state.
Give my mind a listen and I bet it make they mind break.
This ain't a class they won't be mad if I sign late.

Wonder if I died what would they do? would they apologize?
Throw a party? Thank the skies I died? God I'm about to cry.
Solidify my spot as a pariah.
Fuckin' monsters, fuckin' asshole, fuckin' bashful.
Nigga.

And if I'm lying may this place be my fucking tomb.
While my mom is bumping Hott Nigga in the other room.
Ain't got a girl, ain't even got a mistress.
I pray to fuckin' god that I never become religion.
This ain't me looking for attention, this shits clouding up my vision.
Steady listening to niggas who ain't got shit nice to say.
Wanna work me like a slave, lock myself inside a cave.
But won't have the common decency to pay?
Am I all that fucking ugly?
My personality's shit but I'm really cuddly.
I'm a dick to them, to her I'm lovely.
You think that I could get a kiss a fuckin' date.
Without being accused of rape.
Or Even get a girl that loves me.
I'm taking her for granted don't deserve her it's apparent.
I guess I'll grab that fuckin' Glock that I inherit.
With a squeeze and a click while I'm knocking back a fifth.
I'll have this ugly nigga laying in his filth.
XP Nigga.
