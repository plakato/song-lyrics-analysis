Been Robbed Lyrics
by Wu Block.

What happened to that street shit you rap about?
And yo, four bundles of wet.
Where that spot that you sell heron, and dope and all that crack about.

Then I told him shut the fuck up but his dog even said arf! arf!
Sheek and Ghostface on our '88 shit, get your chest hit.


If I take it off your neck, you probably call the cop, it's like.
Cocaine flow, cocaine dough.
Lay 'em down, face first, take the numbers out his cell.
Niggas stop fronting, you don't own a Glock.
Winked at my goons, they leave quick, big man ran.

Told him, yo, kid, respect the juks, and there's one thing.
We smack niggas up, shake 'em down as we see 'em.
Out of respect, I through the gun to his neck, he had singles and loose change.
Get his connect to gag him, so the faggot don't yell.



He tried to raise the price on me in the spring, in the midst of a drought.
Box cutter, get your face split, they yelling like!
Aiyo, I had to shove the fifth in his mouth.
Where that money, where that paper, where that cocaine go?
Take his jewelry and his podium.
'88 Riker's Isle, banging for phone time.
One big nigga slid through, bulky with two shines.
You shouldn't yell around murderous crooks and that's.
Told him papi, no need, just put the slabs in the bag.
