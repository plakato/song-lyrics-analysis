Funky Period Lyrics
by Z!PPO G∆NG.


Microphone check mica microphone checka,.
Robson the God and I'm about to wreck ya.
Listen close, cause I'm about to set it.
The Z!PPO G∆NG got half the uni pregnant.
Step to me and witness an MC.
Who doesn't give two fucks, about a Grammy.
Next on the mic is my man Hugsy.
He about to blast off, in one, two, three.

Tesco, tesco, tesco, value vodka,.
Smoke good shit, make a hit.
Illicit herbs in my pizza.
Cause I'm that super-frenchman so can fuck friend ya,.
And if I took you on my spaceship can I falcon fist ya.
My friends call me Vegeta, yeah I got the dragon balls.
When I kamikameha, then you cumming cumming yeah.

I got my boy Davo, the funky armenian.
He's a backwards man, he likes it doggystyle.
Gets it on for a while, finishes you with the anal.
And on my left Robson, the horny polish stud.
Smokes a bud, destresses to calm his hormones.
And if you're girl ain't up to be his cowgirl.
Then he'll go in deep and make the whore moan.
Now on my right Candyman, yeah he buffer than bane.
If you suck his lollipop, he'll make you taste the sugarcane.

We be the three musketeers at your all-girl party.
So if you got your periods,.
then we'll get our swords bloody,.
Point. Blank.
Period.

My beats make the panties drop and records flop,.
I flow like the Nile, but I do it non-stop.
You won't find this album in any record shop.
Labels know we'd spend the whole profit on rocks.
The Candy Man stole our stash of pot.
Now he's in the Bahamas, hoes rubbing his cock.
Hugsy booked the flight we'll see him there.
Don't like our music I suggest you grow a pair.
Within a few months we'll be everywhere.
Cause the Z!PPO phenomenon is something rare.
Like two dykes on a polar bear.

Candy Man.
*laughs*.
