8 More Miles - Freestyle by 50 Cent and G Unit Lyrics
by 50 Cent.

Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might.
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write.
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life.
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics.
And show these people what my level of skill's like.
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life.
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights.
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like.
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault.
Great then I falls, my insides crawl.
And I clam up  I just slam shut.
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's.
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked.
So I must then get off the bus then split.
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home.
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road.

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan.
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land.
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands.
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back.
And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin.
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone.
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own.
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road.

You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me.
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto.
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you.
The shells hit you, you screamin'.
Think I'm playin'? I mean it.
Man, I done bought all these pistols.
Lets get it poppin'.
Start wavin' my M-1 shell cases get the droppin'.
Death round the courner the corner, I got too much pride to hide.
I'm outside, gun in my pocket you stunnin' and stoppin'.
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know not to test this.
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned.
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons.
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish.
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now that 50 in nice chains.
Beligio, twenty grand, chips at a dice game.
Ballin now, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET.
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin' good.
Or cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your 'hood.
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back.
Cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat.
You pussy.

Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga.
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga.
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga.
Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga.
Read the Daily News nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga.
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit.
Pussy, lets get it poppin'.
