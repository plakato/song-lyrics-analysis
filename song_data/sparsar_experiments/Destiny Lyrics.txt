Destiny Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Yeah.
Break it down.
Ooo eyeayeee.

All my life i been waiting here fo ryou.
A special kind of bouy t make my dreams come truei never thought that i could.
ever find someone.
That boy would never come.
But then one day you came into my life.
And when i felt your ksiss and new that is was right.
You know it had to be it was destiny.
Anyone can see that i was meant to love you.
Boy it;s you an dme you.
Re my estiny no one can deny that you are mine.
Until the end of time holding hand and walking thru the park.
Watching the usn go down.
And kissing the idark.
Those were the special thigs i thoght i would never do.
My heart was empty before i met you.
But now your'e mine and loneliness is gone.
You give me all i need you help me carry on.

You light my darkest day.
When we're together.
Our love is here to stay.
You and me forever.
