Georgia Peaches Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Well, peaches, peaches. Love them Georgia Peaches x2.
She got high-heeled shoes and a dot on her cheek.
Well these Georgia Peaches.
I just seem to fall in love with the wrong things.
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine.
Sure do got the style.
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine.
Well, you can see her walking down on Peach tree Street.
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be.

They'll steal your heart with a Southern smile.
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach x2.
Son they know their way around.
They can take your money, son before you get sight of town.
Ain't got no money, honey.
She knows her way around.
She's looking good, she's headed downtown.
Nine out of ten of them gonna sell you a dime.
Well them Georgia Peaches.
I think she's cute, think she's cute as she can be.
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach.

I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be.
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach.
The older they get, I swear its like good wine.
