Crush Lyrics
by Yuna.


You call me on a lazy afternoon: 
Asking me what I'm up to 
Let's find something to do. 
Baby I'd, be down down down 
Down down down down down down 
You know, I'd be down down down 
Down down down down down down. 
 
I see you arriving in your car 
Jet black Mercedes built in the 70s 
Classic, like you and me, 
I'll, be coming down down down. 
Down down down down down down 
I'll, be down down down 
Down down down down down down, 
 
I feel a little rush. 
I think I've got a little crush on you, 
I hope it's not too much 
But babe! When I'm with you, I hear it. 
My heart singing 
La la la la la la la la-la, 
La la la la la la la la-la, 
 
Honestly. I shouldn't waste time. No more 
Cause, all these little boys you're chasing did they break your heart. 
I know: you've been down down down 
Down down down down down down 
I, won't! Let you down down down 
Down down down down down down 
 
I feel a little rush. 
I think I've got a little crush on you, 
I hope it's not too much 
But girl. When I'm with you, I hear it. 
My heart singing 
La la la la la la la la-la, 
La la la la la la la la-la, 
 
If. You feel the same. 
I see it in the way that you behave around me 
And I can tell 
What. We have is different from anyone else. 
Cause you stop doing what you're doing 
When. I call you come to me running 
And. I would do the same for you. 
So tell me that you feel it too. 
 
I feel a little rush. 
I think I've got a little crush on you, 
I hope it's not too much 
But babe! When I'm with you, I hear it. 
My heart singing 
La, la la la la la la la-la, 
La la la la la la la la-la, 
 
I, think I've got a crush babe 
_Crush on you, too_ 
Feel a little rush, baby 
_And. I feel it too_ 
I think I've got a crush babe 
_Crush on you, too_ 
Feel, a little rush, baby
