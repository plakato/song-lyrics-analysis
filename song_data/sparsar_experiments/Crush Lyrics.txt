Crush Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Tell me what I feel, tell me what I need.
And take me some place I won't wanna leave.

Take my breath and make me crush.
Talk real slow so I won't rush.
Take me some place I won't wanna leave.
I just wanted to say.

Obviously I want to feel, something I can't heal.
Obviously I can't deal.
Something I want, something I wanna feel.
I wanna crush 2x.

Give me something to taste, something I can't waste.
Take my eyes and follow them somewhere great.

Take my breath and make me crush.
Talk real slow so I won't rush.
Take my eyes and follow them somewhere great.
I just wanted to say.

Cause obviously I want to feel, something I can't heal.
And obviously I can't deal.
Something I want, something I wanna feel.
I wanna crush 2x.

Sh....
