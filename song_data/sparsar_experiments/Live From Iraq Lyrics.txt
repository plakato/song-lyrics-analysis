Live From Iraq Lyrics
by 4th25.


Every days like a gamble here.
This is no joke.
This is live from iraq.
Where were praying we make it home.

True gutter for you fuckers.
Think its gutter where you from.
Here its life by the second.
This is everything wrong.

This is not your beef on the block.
No its not that simple.
Here its more than gunfire.
They shooting rockets and missiles.

This is up armour kits.
And bulletproof windows.
We sleep with body armour blankets.
And Kevlar pillows.

In a country.
Where when anybodys talking they lyin.
And wherever there is a soldier.
There is schrapnel flyin.

59 of us april 4th.
8 of us dyin.
This is your thug turnt punk.
This is grown men crying.

This is bombs in the street.
Blowin up when I drive buyem.
Or its rpg's launched at me.
This is nothing problems.

The true definition of goin hard.
No games.
This is hundreds of bodies.
In the streets when we bang.

Cause this is live from Iraq.
Home of too many soldiers graves.
Where for our country.
We gamble with our lives everyday.
And there are no blue skies here.
Every colors gray.
This is the blood of soldiers of which the streets are now paved.
And there is no reimbursement for the price that we pay.
While yall home sleep were here constantly getting weighed.
And every convoy that rides out.
Constantly getting sprayed.
But we don't fold hands.
The cards we are dealt get played.

This is.
Nights wit no supper man.
Home ain't promised man.
Long journeys qualified.
Hell from a promise land.

Dreams feel real but not as real.
As tomorrow man.
Wish life was like contra.
Than life then I could borrow man.

No instant replays.
No highlights any days.
When balls get dropped.
You can't challenge the play.

This is the wrath of equipment.
No refs to stop the clippin.
This no timeouts casue father time.
Is still ticken, this is yeah.

Future in the air.
Pain sculpted in stone.
Families sheddin tears.
Cause they sons ain't comin home.

This is more than a gamble.
And I'll give you the truth.
Plenty of lives lost.
Over a scandal.

Turning more than a cheek.
Warm hearts turn cold.
Higher people in command.
Planning wit no type of goals.

This is your own exposed.
Media cast and the scoop.
Covered over the answers.
Cause you can't handle the truth.

For some this is the answer.
To a whole lot of issues.
Sure its politics back home.
Here its bullets thru our tissue.

This is trying to draw contact.
Hopin they miss you.
This is one mortar round from.
Bein over no continues.

This is nothing yall been thru.
Yall ain't seen shit.
And this is not whats on the news.
What really happens ain't printed.

This is your one mistake.
Bein everbody elses business.
Whether they see their family.
Or its funeral home visits.

This is 150 degrees.
3 months out of the fiscal.
250 g's when that ied hits you.
This is 60 miles an hour.
Thru ambush zones.
This is dead animals with.
Explosive devices on em.

This is the home of direct fire.
Where everybodys a target.
When you find out some people ain't hard.
They just talk shit.

Definitely nothing pretty.
This is no picnic.
This is trying to hold fire.
Without burnin your fingers.
