Inferno Lyrics
by Voli.


This is war.
And the enemy is at my door.
Light the torch.
Let the fire burn through your core.

So tell me why, tell me why.
Love don't last and the good die young.
They sell you lies, they sell you lies.
I fear that the fire will turn to dust.

So do I dance with the devil?
And make all my dreams come true.
Do I dance with the devil?
Do I burn myself for you.
Inferno inferno Inferno.

Dark angel, Bipolar.
Strong halo, God Flower, I was sent from the 80's.
All black leather, black denim, black Avi's.
Took the DeLorean to the future, how pathetic.
Cuz some reason, fellas in the present don't get it.
Way ahead of my time, you later, better rewind.
This message is for the haters, relay it, get a baton.
Here Here, Voli, Nouveau, Yah.
Best shit you neva hearda and I kill it, it's a murder.
And I kill off any juror, no judge no verdict.
Man, Voli got bars, only right for me to serve 'em.
Quarter-life irony, we die for the dollar.
I'm sumthin like Obama, make change, I'm a wallet.
Created my own genre, little bit of Kanye.
Little bit of Sting with a little Bob Marley.
Add a little Nas, Daft Punk, Big Punisher.
Gotta be the shit when these labels can't stomach ya.
Said I'm too damn retro, too damn electro.
But, only doin' rap was just too damn simple.
Dance with the devil? No. Sex with a goddess.
I'm on another level, lemme step it up an octave.
Higher, higher, higher, Inferno, set me on fire.
The only thing that burn is my motherfuckin' desire.

Oh, man on fire.
