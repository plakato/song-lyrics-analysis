Gypsy Caravan Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


I've been living on top the mountain, aye.
You don't think I'm ever coming down.
I'm looking at things that seem to catch my eye.
Wandering around from town to town.

Won't you take me to the.
To the gypsy caravan?
We can live together.
Where the ocean meets the sand.
Won't you take me to the.
To the gypsy caravan?

I'm looking at things that tried to catch your eye.
Things that do what people can't ignore ?
The bolts of lightning tried to strike you down.
The behemoth is waiting at the door.

Won't you take me to the.
To the gypsy caravan?
We can live together.
Where the ocean meets the sand.
Won't you take me to the.
To the gypsy caravan?

I see the gypsy caravan arrive.
I wonder where it's gonna go.

Won't you take me to the.
To the gypsy caravan?
Won't you take me to the.
To the gypsy caravan?
Won't you take me to the.
To the gypsy caravan?
