Back Round Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

I'm coming home, right now.
Can you tell me if the people need to let alone, right now.

I'm coming home.
It's been too long.
Since the light was gone.
I'm coming home, yeah.

Come alive, come alive just to see you.
Realize it's all in front of you.
Realize it's all you ever know.
Realize it's all you ever do.

Oh, I'm coming back around.
Oh, it won't be long.

It looks like someone has been.
Been here before.
They left here thinking they could.
Still have it all.

The tickets sold and the man got rich with a seven year itch.
But all those involved fell over in their own ditch.
They lack eyes to see on parallels; seeing all things as similar.
Those who deny chance have no chance at all.

Oh, I'm coming back around.
Oh, it won't be long.
