The Other Girls Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

I don't want to be like the other girls.
Don't want to see like the other girls.
I don't want to lose myself.
I don't want to live my life like the other girls.
I don't want to spend my time like the girls.
I don't want to lie like the other girls.
Don't wanna try and try, like the other girls.

I just want to spend my time inside my mind.
My mind.

I don't want to live like the other girls.
Don't want to give like the other girls.
I don't want to lose myself.
A lot people tell me these things have to go.
Well, I don't want to live my life like they think I should.
No, I don't want to be like the other girls.
Don't want to see the other girls.

I just want to spend my time inside my mind.
My mind.
My mind.
My mind.
