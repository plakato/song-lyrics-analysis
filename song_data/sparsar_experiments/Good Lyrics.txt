Good Lyrics
by WordPlay T.JAY.


Things were all good just a week ago.
Now they don't even try.
I try to give you good but you don't see me though.
Now it's just goodbye.

I try to leave my pain up on my dresser.
Hoping when I leave it it'll be lesser.
But lately I've been popping under pressure.
I'm creating all this Ash I gotta catch them.
But to make it to the show I gotta press them.
I can't write another song about depression.
I'm a blessing, who God is always testing.
Alcohol becomes a long term investment.
Especially when you in the bed sexing.
A bad woman with some really good flesh and.
She want a little stuffing with her dressing.
And I judge her off the very first impression.
Can't learn my lesson, look for a higher section.
But I'm in it too deep find another heaven.
And I'm tearing shit down call it 9-11.
But a man will never save me need to call a reverend.

I'm hoping that you feel good baby, I'm having a good life.
I hope he treat you real good baby, I'm having a good time.

I try to tell my family that I need them.
And I'm doing all this shit so I can feed them.
But no relief around me heavy breathing.
I'm drowning and my heartbeat is receding.
And they think you're shitty when you leave them.
I could see them at the mall but never greet them.
I ain't bitter, I call it like I see them.
I don't even have the time to make it even.

But wake up and I'm stronger for some reason.
I'm better when I'm battling the demons.
The devil tryna take my support.
But he never should have tried me when I hit home court.
He just a hating kid trying to knock down forts.
You put up a good fight but it's not your sport.

It don't matter, I'm doing real good without you x3.
It don't matter, I'm feeling real good without you.
