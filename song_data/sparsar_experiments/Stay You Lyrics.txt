Stay You Lyrics
by Wood.

I love the way you speak and I love the way you swear.
I love the way you walk around with your head held in the air.
And I love the way your words move and I love the way you drive.
I love the way you're scared of people scared to be alive.
Stay, stay you that's the toughest thing to do.
Stay, stay you that's the toughest thing to do.
I love the way you dress upon a Saturday night.
I love the way you never speak until it feels just right.
I love the way you're spending all your money on yourself.
I love the way you answer the phone and pretend you're somebody else.
Stay, stay you that's the toughest thing to do.
Stay, stay you that's the toughest thing to do.
And now I don't want to talk about the things you overcame.
By dragging up the past I'll put you through it all again.
I've got the greatest admiration for the way that you got through it.
Couldn't ask nobody else to do it better than you do it.
Stay, stay you that's the toughest thing to do.
Stay, stay you that's the toughest thing to do.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
