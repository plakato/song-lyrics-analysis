Clap That Ass Lyrics
by V-Nasty.

V-Basty, Princess Drop Dehd, D. Bledose.
Throw it back, hoe.
Make it clap, hoe.
You a pornstar, you know how to act, hoe.

I'm a pimp, bitch.
Yeah, I get chips.
Stop playin', girl.
You know who you fuckin' with.

You been doin' this.
Girl you ain't no amature.
Pop that ass like you working for the camera.
Me and my men tonight, we mobbin' in the Challenger.
Getting money everyday, look at my calendar.

K, ?, Rozay, poppin' champaigne.
Ice with the syrup, it ain't a damn thang.
Feelin' good and I wish a bitch would.
Quit playin' wit my money, girl I don't do it.

Drop out the fluid.
Lookin' for a prostitute.
You want red bottoms? Then girl you got a lot to do.
I'm a pimp, bitch, and I thought you knew.
All I wanna hear is, What I got for you!

V-Basty, Princess Drop Dehd, D. Bledose.
Throw it back, hoe.
Make it clap, hoe.
You a pornstar, you know how to act, hoe.

I'm a pimp, bitch.
Yeah, I get chips.
Stop playin', girl.
You know who you fuckin' with.

Princess Drop Dehd.

I bring that ass back.
But I ain't clappin' shit if you ain't got no cash.
I'm a real ass bitch, so you ain't flashin' shit.
You must be stupid if you think you gon' hit.

Keep that story to yourself.
I don't give a fuck if it ain't about my wealth.
Go find a bum bitch, cause I don't need no help.
I do this shit, and I do it by myself.

I'm a cold bitch.
I gotta have it.
Stackin' this paper like a mothafuckin' have it.
I ain't no type of hater, but I'm sicker than the average.
Ain't got no guilt but I'm livin' in a mansion.

V-Basty, Princess Drop Dehd, D. Bledose.
Throw it back, hoe.
Make it clap, hoe.
You a pornstar, you know how to act, hoe.

I'm a pimp, bitch.
Yeah, I get chips.
Stop playin', girl.
You know who you fuckin' with.
