In the Arms of the One Who Loves Me Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.

It's amazing to me in a world full of wonders.
I wonder for she makes me feel.
I've been everywhere under the sun.
And there's nothing that can even compete with her touch.

It's incredible, her love.
It's some kind of miracle.

I don't need to take a plane.
Fly a mile above the rain.
Or stand up on a mountain.
And have the world at my feet.

She's just gotta smile that smile.

I'd rather be.
Than in the arms of the one who loves me.

It's a powerful thing to walk through the doorway.
Of somebody's heart and somebody's soul.
Oh, you know even for always.
Wherever you are, wherever you go.

And no high can be higher than her eyes.
Looking into her mine.

I don't need to take a plane.
Fly a mile above the rain.
Or stand up on a mountain.
And have the world at my feet.

She's just gotta smile that smile.

I'd rather be.
Than in the arms of the one who loves me.
Yeah, she loves me, oh.

I don't need to take a plane.
Fly a mile above the rain.
Or stand up on a mountain.
And have the world at my feet.

She's just gotta smile that smile.

I'd rather be.
Than in the arms of the one who loves me.
Ohh, in the arms of the one who loves me.
