Projects Lyrics
by Swoop G.


Me and Keita Rock, off to our spot in the PJ's.
Where our niggas hold rocks... and.
Glocks and AK's.
Put our little homies up on game....
Give 'em some change.
2 months passed, they move 32 whole thangs.
Keys... OG's, set up shop.
And let the BG's hold the block.
And work the spots.
And tote them Glocks.
So you might get shot.
Them little niggas in the projects be bangin' a lot.
Now... don't you know that you was trippin' when you came through?
Tryin' to buy your work and wasn't framed up with no blue?
Got jacked, couldn't react....
Don't get back.
Left you naked in the parking lot, holdin' your sack.
And that's... just... how the shit go.
So don't be fuckin' with them projects on the West Coast.
Yeah... you gotta bad bitch, huh?
You wanna roll through the projects get your dick sucked, and get fucked?
But you got fucked in the wrong kind of fuck-in.
Wrong color car, niggas saw your car and start bustin'.
No questions askin'.
Just niggas who be mashin'.
In Watts... they got some real cold assassins.

Yeah, Wilmington Arms....
Where my niggas got the straps.
Nickerson Gardens....
Where my niggas got the sacks.
Jordan Downs....
That's when my niggas kick it at:.
In the projects....
In the projects....

Yeah....
I said, Wilmington Arms....
Where my niggas got the gats.
Nickerson Gardens....
That's where them niggas got the sacks.
Jordan Downs....
That's when my niggas kick it at:.
In the projects....
In the projects....

Pull up to the curb in that fresh, wet tint.
Yup, they 100 spokes, ghetto fabulous.
Remmy in my cup.
Bangin' my own shit.
Go and get a cup... what up?

On the D-L livin' it up.

What?

Yup, you know it....
20's, 50's, 100's, you know the streets, we run it.
I'ma get mine.
Everytime.
Hold to make a knot.
What cha got on the drink?
Headed to the store, across the street from the projects.
Gun play... that shit still crack.
Some get hit and don't hit back.
Front-back, side-to-side.
3-wheel motion.
We floss the most and it's on.
Representing the projects.

Swoop G, let me put you up on some project shit.
In Southern California, niggas call 'em the bricks.
Some bang Blood... some bang Crip.
I met a bad ass, yellow-bone, project bitch.
So you know, like I know.
That I'm assed-out to the Pablo's.
In the blue Ford.
Blue Khaks.
Blue Chucks, with the tongue fold.
Pablo's ??? from the parkin' lot.
A nigga life on the line, for a piece of cock.
So I grabbed my 4-5, out the stash spot.
Put it to my side, and hang through the parkin' lot.
Little niggas like: Blood, that's Keita Rock....
He fucks with the big home boy Stutter-Box.
So back the fuck up, nigga.
You're crowdin' my space.
It's the nigga with that L.A. Dodger face.
Death Row blew a flame.
Piru, 60 gang.
And every project that I bang through, respect my name.
