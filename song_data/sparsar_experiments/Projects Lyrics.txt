Projects Lyrics
by Swoop G.


Me and Keita Rock off to our spot in the PJ's 
Where, our niggas hold rocks ... and
Glocks and AK's 
Put our little homies up on game. ... 
Give'em some change 
2 months passed. They move 32 whole thangs, 
Keys ... OG's set up shop 
And. Let the BG's hold the block. 
And work, the spots 
And tote them Glocks 
So, you might get shot 
Them little niggas in the projects be bangin' a lot 
Now ...! Don'T you know that you was trippin' when you came through 
Tryin' to buy your work and wasn't framed up with no blue 
Got jacked couldn't react. ... 
Don't get back 
Left you naked in the parking lot holdin' your sack 
And! That'S ... just ... how the shit go. 
So, don't be fuckin' with them projects on the West Coast, 
Yeah ..., you got ta bad bitch, huh, 
You wan na roll through the projects, get your dick sucked and get fucked 
But. You got fucked in the wrong kind of fuck-in 
Wrong color car niggas saw your car and start bustin' 
No questions askin' 
Just niggas, who be mashin' 
In, Watts .... They got some real cold assassins, 
 
Yeah, Wilmington Arms, ... 
Where. My niggas got the straps 
Nickerson Gardens ... 
Where. My niggas got the sacks 
Jordan Downs, ... 
That's. When my niggas kick it at 
In. The projects ... 
In the projects, ... 
, 
Yeah, ... 
I, said Wilmington Arms, ... 
Where. My niggas got the gats 
Nickerson Gardens ... 
That's, where them niggas got the sacks 
Jordan Downs, ... 
That's. When my niggas kick it at 
In the projects ... 
In the projects, ... 
 
Pull up to the curb in that fresh, wet, tint 
Yup. They 100 spokes ghetto. Fabulous 
Remmy in my cup 
Bangin' my own shit 
Go and get a cup .... What up 
 
On the D-L livin' it up, 
 
What, 
 
Yup! You know it ... 
20's, 50's. 100'S. You know the streets, we run. It 
I'ma get mine, 
Everytime 
Hold, to make a knot. 
What cha got on the drink 
Headed to the store across the street, from the projects 
Gun play, ... that shit still crack 
Some get hit and don't hit back. 
Front-Back side-to-side 
3-wheel motion, 
We floss the most and it's on 
Representing the projects, 
 
Swoop G. Let me put you up on some project: shit, 
In, Southern California, niggas call'em, the bricks, 
Some, bang Blood ..., some bang Crip 
I met a bad ass, yellow-bone project, bitch 
So. You know, like I know, 
That I'm assed-out to the Pablo's 
In, the blue Ford, 
Blue Khaks 
Blue Chucks, with the tongue fold 
Pablo's from the parkin' lot, 
A nigga life on the line for a piece of cock 
So. I grabbed my 4-5 out the stash spot 
Put. It to my side and hang through the parkin' lot: 
Little niggas like Blood, that's Keita, Rock ..., 
He fucks, with the big home boy, Stutter-Box 
So, back the fuck up, nigga 
You're crowdin', my space 
It's, the nigga. With that L.A. Dodger face 
Death Row blew a flame, 
Piru 60 gang 
And every project that I bang through respect, my name
