Sleep To Dream Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

Packin up with tears in our eyes.
It's a pastime I'm used to.
Gettin good at saying goodbye.
Since it's all I ever seem to do.

Oh, I've been floatin around way too easy.
Go, wherever the breeze wants to leave me.
Never know when I'm coming through.
But when I do I'm gonna run to you.
Cause it feels right....

How can you make it better?

How will we push on through?

How can I keep us together?

I'm living here without you.

I had a strange dream the other night.
Everything was better than I knew.
The roads were gold, water was wine.
And when we kissed the magic grew.
I said Oh how can it be now.
Oh, I just felt my feet touch the ground.
I'm in love, I'm in love all the time.
But it feels so new with you.
Cause it feels right....

How can you make it better?

How will we push on through?

How can I keep us together?

I'm living here without you.

There's nothing to say now.
You've run out of ways to let me down.
There's too much space, not enough time.
Unlike the days you were mine.
Whenever I'm with you.
So I don't know why.
I'm living here without you.
Cause it feels right....

How can you make it better?

How will we push on through?

How can I keep us together?

I'm living here without you.

Packin up with tears in our eyes.
It's the pastime I'm used to.
Gettin good at saying goodbye.
Cause it's all we ever seem to do.
