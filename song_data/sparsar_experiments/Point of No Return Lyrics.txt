Point of No Return Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


I'm at the point, of no return.
Caught up in this game, everybody know my name.
I got, money to burn.

Ronnie Spencer.
I've been struggling, started off with nothing.
Everybody know me, as the one to do thangs for free.
Right now, I'm on the grind.
See you got yours, I gotta get mine.
See the most high, gave me a sign.
He said son, it's your time.

Dirty $.
I'm at the crossroad in my life, and baby it's do or die.
Fall or floss, small or cry could mean slow suicide.
On these streets scratching for my keep, grinding for my people.
When you're not treated equal, it's so hard to live legal.
Will my seed deceive em, to this never ending saga.
Fascinated by cash cars, and clothes just like our papa.
Taking mo' gambles than Pac did, in pursuit of the dolla.
On the verge of crapping out, from money and power.
Having big body dreams, and wood grain wishes.
Trying to taste the good life, cause it looks so delicious.
Man the pressure's tremendous, so I smoke on spinach.
Trying to find some piece of mind, than get caught from behind.
Mashing for the finish line, in this cruel millennium.
Make mo' shine than lime, I'm spending more than time.
Rocking pie with dimes, keep the top reclined.
Use to be caught up in grind, now addicted to rhyme.

Ronnie Spencer.
Never turn my back, on what's real to me.
That's my love, for my Wreckshop family.
I had my share of likes, up's and down's.
And thank goodness, I'm still around.
Never could, make it on my own.
When I'm looking in the sky, and I'm feeling so fly.
But though one day, you're here.
Then the next day, you're gone.

Tyte Eyez.
I'm at the point of no return, and ain't no looking back.
Cause there's ends I got to meet, big faces I got to stack.
They say man'll make the money, but money'll make us move.
Positions to get richer, a seven figga made dude.
Calm on the cool, collecting cash flow.

The new millennium, Mr. Tyte E-Z.
And if I turn my back now, then my kids won't eat.
My wolf pack won't sleep, until we slay all prey.
Get vicious without perdition in this Y2K.
This feddy is in my vision, in this hectic paper chase.
Wrecking my lyrical weapon, pimp the pen at a steady pace.
Appreciate God pressing, no cases and no bars.
Frauds and changed faces, but my game's up to par.
A ghetto shooting star, and I ain't trying to go back.
To the guns and the slums, and the jacks or the crack.

Ronnie Spencer.
La-da-da-da-da.
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da - 4x.

Iiiiii'm caught up, caught up.
To the point of no return, everybody.
Everybody knooows, caught up baby.
Ooooh-oooooh caught up baby.
I don't wanna go back, I don't wanna leave.
I don't wanna go back baby.
I'm caught up, heeeey.
