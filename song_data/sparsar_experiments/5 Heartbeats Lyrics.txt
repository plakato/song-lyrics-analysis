5 Heartbeats Lyrics
by 50 Cent.


Nights like this... I wish.
Rain drops would fall.
5 heartbeats left.
One last deep breath.

I got a 16 shot Ruger, I got 16 cars.
All over how I write 16 bars.
Ja, Joe and Jada they're fuckin' retards.
I run Interscope, uh-uh Oh, my God.
Your stuff I'll make it hot.
You want I'll get ya shot.
You're just open your coffin.
You're dead men walking.
Now when I'm out in London they say I'm so smart.
I fired rounds from pounds I came up so hard.

I been around the world and aiya-ya-ya.
Must be goin' crazy.
Cause I'm still down.
To get down to let off rounds.
I'm loadin up my 380.
I can't wait 'till I see death.

I'm tryin' to pray to the preacher man but he in new gators.
My ASCAP check got a nigga new haters.
The condos in Vegas - cause NY freezin'.
My strap is the reason that you on the floor bleedin'.
I learned the Coke game Young and Watchin' 50!
And learned the dope game fast ask Bo-Diddly.
Automatic Mossberg in the all white fur.
Shotgun pellets out of snow white spur. shot {DAMN!}.

I been around the world and aiya-ya-ya!
Must be goin' crazy.
Cause I'm still down.
To get down to let off rounds.
I'm loadin' up my 380.
I can't wait 'till I see - death!
Oh babyyyy!
Nigga I'm gonna... I'm gonna find you.

It's the first of the month.
Hahahaha.
It's the first of the motherfuckin' month nigga.
OOOHHH!
It's a fuckin' zoo out here, man.
These fuckin' chimpanzees, man.
Fuckin' monkeys talkin' 'bout me, man.
Pull through there man, it's hot.
These niggas out on the curb, I'm like look at these donkies.
Bunch of fuckin' jackasses.
Man go do something, nigga.
What the fuck, man?
Damn, nigga go to jail nigga.
Give yourself an excuse for bein' Fuckin' broke nigga.
Come on, man.
Fuck is up man.
This 50, man.
South Side, man.
You already know what I'm about boy.
