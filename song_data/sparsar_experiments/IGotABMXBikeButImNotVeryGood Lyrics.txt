IGotABMXBikeButImNotVeryGood Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.

Bones.
I've got a BMX bike but I'm not very good.
I try to do a 180 and I bust my lip.
But I don't give a fuck, I'm still riding like I should.
I try to grind on the curb and I lose my grip.

Xavier Wulf.
I got a piece of shit bike that I don't really like, I ride around and bunny hop.
and now.
I try to 180 off a damn curb and hit my knee across the bar so hard I hit the.
ground.
I be on Instagram chillin', watchin' Stevie and young Begin go so hard, I be.
like Oh my damn.
I ain't gon lie, I'm inspirated, and I'm faded, smoking indy.
while I cruise around my side of town.

Bones.
Wheels get to turnin'.
Blunts get to burnin'.
I don't give a fuck, all I wanna do is learn tricks.
I don't give a fuck, all I wanna do is learn tricks.
Sesh.
