ObsidianTears Lyrics
by Zulu.

Her words hit my frame like poison darts.
Songbirds chirp indifferent to the day.
Cries echoed out from the booth to the back pew.
Gondola rendezvous on the rivers of my heart.
Only confidant is a Ouija board.

Got a call at two, she took the blue pill.
Past pains dance in the wisp of my cigarette.


Casting ash and everything's in grey.
Tell tell hearts in my inbox rot.
Funeral pyres burning brilliant with love lost.
Watch teardrops fall on their own accord.
Said she never found love, I guess I didn't too.
Not a beep from the phone, just the tock of the clock.
Sun coalesced with the moon, open wound.
Vignettes soon carried off by the rain.
