Tales of a Killa Lyrics
by Woodie.


Listen to the tales of this Northern Cali killer, 
Take it for what it's worth but recognize a blood spiller 
So far I've been lucky but enemies might take me 
Take chances again. If they under estimate me 
 
Woodie 
Say, your Prayers count, your blessings, 
Grab your weapon grip, it tight 
Cause! Tonight I sport my put in work sweatshirt right 
But, you won't catch me, barking, duels! In a lark tonight, 
Creep up on foot and down the street. I got a stolen bike, 
Thats my getaway, but first I go to sit and wait. 
Lurking in the shadows on mission. To do my hit and shake 
Patience always pays, so I'm stiffer than a statue. 
By no means I won't fuck this up. This suckers life is past due 
I know he's home the TVs on. I see a shadow through the blinds 
Walking towards the front door 
Yeah. I think its about that time. 
Sure enough door opens wide 
Now he's stepping outside 
Barrel flashes from the bushes. All he seen before he died. 
Bent a corner run down the block hop on the BMX 
Meanwhile. His bitch is in shock hugging his bleeding chest, 
Pedal to my safe spot, 
Get, the fireplace hot 
Burn up my clothing scrub. My body 
Gunpowder trace gone 
On the way home I disassembled and disbursed 
Of my weapon in the gutters from 10th street to 1st 
So, I'm feeling pretty confident. My mission was successful. 
Kick up my feet: crack and Old E and drink a chest: full 
 
Listen to the tales of this northern cali killer, 
Take it for what its worth but recognize a blood spiller 
So far I've been lucky but enemies might take me 
Take chances again if they Under estimate me 
 
Why, they want to test me stress me to the point: I'm homicidal 
Don't, they recognize death is nothing new. In my eyes, 
When it comes to defending my title: 
 
Woodie 
Another sloppy late night in the drive thru waiting for our food 
Me and 2 homies and a bitch drinking 40's, an Boones 
Out at 2. One ounce left, so I'm burning holes in my head. 
I turn around fools are looking at me like they want me. Dead 
Words were said without a doubt, I'm knowing that the funks jumping 
They must be packing fuck, that I'll be the first to dump something 
Told. My homie drive and pull the car to the side of the road, 
They pulled up said a word or two. Until I proceeded to unload 
Bullets lighting up, the backseat windows are shattering 
Since, I'm thinking that they pack heat, I'm skipping the chattering 
I emptied the clip, 
Not sure how many were hit. 
I told my homie drive and lets split. He started to trip 
He just stopped froze 
Like. He was comatose. 
I said its not the time to break down like a ho lets. Go 
He finally put the pedal to the metal, but that tripped me out 
I told him drive a half a mile pull over and let me out 
Shake the spot and take the under routes park up in the cuts 
Now. This motherfucker starts driving in circles going nuts 
Scramblin' on the belt. 
I think you blew his brains out 
Sucka, that's another reason we should vanish, not hang out, 
I told him. Yo bitch got more nuts than you, 
Saw, red and blue behind us 
Thanks to my homie's, dumb bitch. It wasn't to hard to find us 
And. Then he proceeds to take them on a slow speed chase. 
Twenty Five I'm going to face the DA's got a clean case. 
With about seven different patrol cars in pursuit 
He pulls over and Five 0 draws their weapons ready to shoot. 
Over. The bullhorn I can hear them say 
Come out with your hands raised. 
I did exactly that, but then I broke and made them give chase 
Striking through a field. I hit a barbwire fence. 
I hopped it like a champion only got a rip in my pants 
Then. I advanced up on a bike trail 
Slowly, losing 50's tail 
Noticed water to the left, threw my strap in the canal. 
Half the evidence gone apartment, complex straight ahead. 
I'M more than halfway to home, I'm only giving up dead, 
I got ta stop to take a breath. In the apartments - and I listen, 
I can hear the ghetto bird, but it ain't knowing my position: 
Continuing on my mission, 
I'm hopping yard, to yard 
Crawling bush to bush 
Hiding, underneath car to car 
And. Now, three hours later and about 2 miles down the road 
I'm in front of my homies house, my hearts about to explode 
Knocked on the door at 4am, 
He wasn't one bit. Suprised 
He said he heard me on the scanner 
And. He knew I had to ride. 
You say you're a gangster and don't feel that 
You're faking it
