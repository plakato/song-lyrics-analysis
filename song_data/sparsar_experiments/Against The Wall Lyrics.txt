Against The Wall Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

I can't see the forest from the trees.
Headin'straight for a catastrophe.
One step forward two steps back.
Is a heart attack.

I'm going'heard first.
No warning signs.
Out in the danger zone.
Every single night.

Throw my heart against the wall.
Don't know where I'm going.
Take a chance and win it all.
Breakin'all the rules.
Let's throw caution to the wind.
Don't know where it's blowing.
Throw my heart against.
Heart against.
Heart against the wall.

My head is spinnin.
I can't see straight.
And that's when I'm havin.
A real good day.
When the same two muscles.
Ignore the brain.
You gotta follow your heart.
And shive the fate.

I got more love than sense.
And that ain't no defense.
I'm gonna hurt myself.
I've been a fool before.
And then I closed the door.
And walked into the wall.
Yes I did !
