Clouds - Redux Lyrics
by UNKLE.

You are lightning bolt.
Yes we must find a way.
To conduct your energy.
To a life machine.

Well you are.
Softly shaking electricity.
Softly shaking electricity.
Well you are.
Static hair in a cloud machine.
Static hair in a cloud machine....

Well you are.
Softly shaking electricity.
Softly shaking electricity.
Well you are.
Static hair in a cloud machine.
Static hair in a cloud machine....

You are lightning bolt.
Yes we must find a way.
To conduct your energy.
To a life machine.

Well you are.
Softly shaking electricity.
Softly shaking electricity.

Well you are.
Static hair in a cloud machine.
Static hair in a cloud machine... x10.

You are lightning bolt.
Yes we must find a way....
