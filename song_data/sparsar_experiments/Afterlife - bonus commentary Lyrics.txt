Afterlife - bonus commentary Lyrics
by Switchfoot.

I've tasted fire.
I'm ready to come alive.
I can't just shut it up.
And fake that I'm alright.
I'm ready now.
I'm not waiting for the afterlife.
I'll let it burn the way the sunlight burns my skin.
The way I feel inside, the way the day begins.
I'm ready now, I'm not waiting for the other side.
I'm ready now, I'm ready now.
Cause every day the world is made.
A chance to change but I feel the same.
And I wonder why would I wait 'til I die to come alive?
I'm ready now, I'm not waiting for the afterlife.
Yeah.
I still believe we can live forever.
You and I we begin forever now.
Forever now, forever.
I still believe in us together.
You and I we're here together now.
Forever now, forever now, but never now.
Cause every day the world is made.
A chance to change but I feel the same.
And I wonder why would I wait 'til I die to come alive?
I'm ready now, I'm not waiting for the afterlife.
Every day, a choice is made.
Every day I choose my fate.
And i wonder why would I wait 'til I die to come alive? To come alive?
Every day, every day, every day I still feel the same.
And I wonder why would I wait 'til I die to come alive?
I'm ready now I'm not waiting for the afterlife.
I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready.
I'm ready now, I'm not waiting for the afterlife.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
