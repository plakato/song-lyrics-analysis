Forever Spaceman Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


I'm so sad that I'm falling out, ooh.
Now I can't share my troubles and doubts, ooh.
Now I'm falling but I won't touch the ground, ooh.
And of course that I'm thinking of her.

The part I most enjoy is the sunrise.
Because it's only gonna get lighter.

When I grow up, will I be forever, spaceman?
A floating hero in space.

Tell my friends that I won't make the papers.
A floating headline in space.

Oh I, oh I, am a tiny little dancer in space.
I, oh I, I'll see you when skies aren't grey.

Now all that I can see is wild, wild rivers.
And all the snowstorms and mad, mad shivers.
