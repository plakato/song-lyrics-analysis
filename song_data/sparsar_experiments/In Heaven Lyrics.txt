In Heaven Lyrics
by The Zolas.

At intermission.
We meet outside.
A grin of a hug.
You blow your cigarette in the other direction.
We laugh at the same jokes.
But she pops the balloon when she walks through the room to you.
In heaven.

Who can control.
The bitter blast.
We know we let in the cold when we defenestrate the past and now.
She's not at the other end of our telephone calls.
She's in a desert on the surface of mars.
With you in heaven.
