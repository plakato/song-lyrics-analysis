Alouette Lyrics
by Unknown.

ALMA MATER.
FAR ABOVE CAYUGA'S WATERS.
Far above Cayuga's waters.
With it's waves of blue.
Stands our noble alma mater.
Glorious to view.

Loud her praises tell.
Hail to thee, our alma Mater.
Hail, all hail, Cornell.
Far above the busy humming.
Of the bustling town.
Reared against the arch of heaven.
Looks she proudly down.
Filename CRNLALMA.
SF.
