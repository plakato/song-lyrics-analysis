The Return of the Yung Don Dada Lyrics
by Yungstar.

Joseph Wilkes - 2x.
I know you gon love it, everybody gotta.
It's the return, of the Yung Don Dada.
On your radio, ain't nothing hotter.
It's Joseph Wilkes, and that Yung Don Dada.

Yungstar.
I can travel fumble to fall, when ball on me.
No striking out just throw me the rock, and watch the crowd no bleep.
I'm small but tall on my feet, in the street better ask your friend.
I ain't goin nowhere but around the world, yeah and I'm back again.
With having ends is faxing in, with that Yung Don Dada.
I signed a mill on my first album went platinum, 'fore Wanna Be A Baller.
I'm a leader not follow, just staring at the reality of my rear view.
Show you what going down here the time, just like a sneak preview.
Thanks to Screw got G's and food, break the bank the legal way.
In and out with large amounts, took gavel to Kappa for winter baby.
Repping our state on inches, baby we balling out of control.
Stop riding Excursions no Lexus, 24 foot roll get off the road.
Millennium drove millennium low, millennium drove.
Who wanna play with the CEO, who wanna play on 24's.
Mama said everytime they swing, block and weave and then unload.
There is no I in team, for two year dreams and get you gold.

Yungstar.
I spit out that real shit quick, unexpected like screwing.
Get out real quick, if I'm ever arrested for doing it.
Cause adolescent I influence, now pick up your pad and ruin it.
I done everything I want, so being jacked by two kids.
I'm not new to this I'm true to this, if you start it I'ma finish.
Pat told you playas and gangsta too, starched in some origin.
If you name it I could claim, from Main to Spain I shop.
Not only I-10's the route, so be surprised when we jump out.
It's lunch time cock far like Martin, it's crunch time.
You need me to keep the water boiling, then I make it off one rhyme.
Cause I know one mo' time, playing a game and it's over.
So you can picture me rolling holding, Lamborgini do's on the Rover.
Ain't no telling what I mean, you know I stay popping tags.
And only shoes the shirt the hat, with the fragrance to match.
With Supa Dave on the track, and  on the vocals.
Thanks to Screw to a hood near you, you already know how it go so.

Top Dollar.
I swing wide, and sit low.
Turn your head, come on your hoe.
Southwest H-Town, nigga what.
Topdollar.com, bigger nuts.
Pick a cut, spice lane to the brain.
I'm gutter boy everyday, all day.
See me top down, high looking good.
Pop the trunk, we getting paid in the hood.
Networking, leaving seeds on the street.
Boy you know, it's Supa Dave on the beat.
Top Dollar, yeah I'm straight out the leaf.
Beach nut boy, we got heat.

There you have it, the return of the Yung Don Dada.
Brought to you, by Alpha II Entertainment.
And yours truly, your boy Big Face Tulu.
And Chill Will, beat for that U.N. Click.
Supa Dave, keeping it hot.
And that star machine, what's up Rock.
