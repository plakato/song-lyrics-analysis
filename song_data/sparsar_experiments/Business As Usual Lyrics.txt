Business As Usual Lyrics
by ZSK.

Economic interests, religion, patriotism and fucking greed.
Day by day help to make the battlefields turn red.
A vicious circle with no winners just losers.
When will we stop this useless killing?

No War, No Hatred.
No support for the arms traffic.
And the profits that they make.
No War, No Nation.
No support for governments.
And the bribes that they take.

Greedy politicians supporting dictatorships, subverting democracy, worldwide.
This is their theory of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Arms supply and weapons of mass destruction.
The never-ending chain reaction.
