Cowboy Killers Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

Well I had to have been programmed.
For anything but this.
And to be honest you weren't a mark I'd aim to miss.
With your ten gallon hat and the spurs on your shoes.
It's everything in me that wants to kill you.

So lay me down, I'll smoke you out.
You won't make a sound, I'll find you without.

It was a mad man.
Who put this in my head.
A virus that makes me want all cowboys dead.
With this gun on my arm and this look in my eye.
Bitch you better know that it's time to die.

Lay me down, I'll smoke you out.
You won't make a sound, I'll find you without.

Lay me down, I'll smoke you out.

I'll put holes in your chest, with my laser cannons.
I'm gonna rip off your head, I want all cowboys dead.
I'll put holes in your chest, with my laser cannons.
I'm gonna rip off your head, I want all cowboys dead.
