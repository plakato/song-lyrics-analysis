Breakfast Club Lyrics
by Z-Trip.


If-If, you are listening to the new Z-Trip album on Hollywood Records 
We're here we're being silly. We got Supernatural 
Z-Trip, I'm MURS and I like to have a good time 
And on Saturday mornings, I used to like to get a big fat bowl of cereal 
And watch cartoons motherfucker, and, if that, if you can't relate to this
song 
You're, taking this shit too serious., It'S hip-hop man, it's-it's fuckin', fun, 
 
Ooh. I love eatin' cereal 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I love Fruity Pebbles 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I love Super Sugar, Crisp 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I love Count. Chocula 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons, 
 
Let's go 
Pour the milk in the bowl 
Make sure it's ice, cold 
Put my hand on the top 
So it won't overflow 
Forget playing outside with my friends from school 
It's Saturday morning, fool 
But! You know what ain't cool 
Wakin' up, first 
Cause, all that be on the tube 
Is, the Snorks and Smurfs 
 Strawberry Shortcake, the worst 
But comin' up next 
Was, my boy, Johnny Quest, 
Sim, Sim Salabim, 
But Fat Albert was the best 
The Brown Hornet Picture
Pages 
Made me Want to write graffiti 
I had to do it when Davey and Goliath couldn't see me 
Always tryin' to do right, they'd be hangin' out with Dudley 
But. I watched Wacky Races 
Rootin' for my dog Muttley 
You know what really bugged me. 
Go-Bots was wack 
Man. They bit the Transformers 
And, that's a well known fact: 
But ... 
After. These messages we'll be right. Back 
 
Ooh, I love eatin' cereal 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I love to eat Frosted Flakes 
When, I'm watchin', my cartoons 
Ooh. I love to eat Alphabits 
When. I'M watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I love King Vitaman 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons, 
 
I. Remember: Teen Wolf tried to go vegetarian 
Told Thunder. He was a sick, barbarian, 
For eatin' Tiger Sharks with his
Ninja Turtle soup. 
Because of that the Herculoids had to kick him out. The group 
Yo there used to be drama on the after school scene. 
Tiny Toons started beefin' with Beverly Hills, Teens 
But the Get Along Gang would come through and make amends 
And by the end of the week. They were all Super Friends: 
But GI, Joe, would get riled up again, 
Guns out lookin' for weapons of mass destruction, 
Harassin' Silver Hawks for little or nothing 
Of course. The Care Bears wouldn't have the heart to do. Somethin' 
I called Voltron on these Inhumanoids 
The Superions. Wouldn'T let the Joes be destroyed, 
You know even in Cartoons. 
Americana can't be tackled 
But at least we know now. 
And knowin' is half the battle. 
 
Ooh I love to eat cereal 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I love to eat Honey, Comb 
When, I'm watchin'. My cartoons 
Ooh, I love to eat Cookie, Crisp 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I love to eat Fruit, Loops 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons, 
 
Now right before we go 
I think you got the right to know about She-Ra 
On. The low 
She was a Thundercat ho 
Orco tryin' to cover up and say she got a man 
But he lied. 
It was really one of Jem's Holograms 
After that 
I got nosy, went around the back 
And found out Josie sellin' Pussy to Cats, 
Chargin' 3, 2. 1. For a little Contact, 
Because Hong Kong Phooey had the illest pimp slap 
Her, sweet, Jabber Jaws went to the highest bid 
But. What made it worse was she Incorporated? Kids, 
So Marshall Bravestarr came through with Captain Power. 
And vowed that G-Force would shut'em down within the hour. 
Until Chip'N Dale and the Rescue Rangers 
Came through to save them hoes with a Mouse named Danger, 
To make things stranger 
She still gets to ho 
Well. Let a ho be a ho 
And, that's one to grow on 
 
Ooh. I love eatin' cereal 
When, I'm watchin'. My cartoons 
Ooh, I love Crunch Berries, 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I love Rice, Krispies 
When, I'm watchin', my cartoons 
Ooh. I love to eat Golden Grahams 
When, I'm watchin', my cartoons 
Ooh. I love to eat Apple Jacks 
When, I'm watchin', my cartoons 
Ooh. I love to eat Cheerios 
When, I'm watchin', my cartoons 
Ooh. I love to eat Trix 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons 
Ooh. I like Cap'n, Crunch 
When, I'm watchin' my cartoons, 
 
And. You know I can't live without my cereal 
And. You know I can't live without my cereal
