Owens Lyrics
by VNCHY.


I'm bouta.
Hopped up out the coupe in em Owens.
My focus Michael Jordan.
Focus on the moment.
Serotonin ain't important.
Til your whips.
*IMPORTED*.
These bitches.
*IMPORTED*.

Fuck the love they showing.
Dawg just know there ain't limits to this.

Im tryna to move that fast.
Soon time finna move that cash.
1st class, tryna pop champagne on my way out to Spain.
We just came back from Cannes bring em all.
Bring em all.
Won't stop til I earn millions.
Thinking back when I was barely on.
Waited til they felt safe, red dot on the scope - I got em.
Shit- I'm just tryna go hard.
Thousand acre yard.
Get my girl some goyard.
Bags-pop tags with her out in New York.
Breathing from a blunt- Tom Ford shades on.
Eyes red for the moment.
Patron when I'm rolling.
That's Drunk driving the carrera in the morning.
Fly private this the era of the lord.
Skuuur through the boulevard.

And.

Hopped up out the coupe in em Owens.
My focus Michael Jordan.
Focus on the moment.
Serotonin ain't important.
Til your whips.
*IMPORTED*.
These bitches.
*IMPORTED*.

Fuck the love they showing.
Dawg just know there ain't limits to this.

Can't you see by their reaction.
Like black james bond rolling in that aston.
I must thank God always had my talents.
Put to practice- above average-.
Shit- I called out on your BS, Got my loot, eject.
And cut like crew neck.
All of yall witness the rise of the prefect.
Get shutdown like a nigga booked skepta.
Get your zen up.
Cuz my energy tesla.
Your one chance in a battle i won't let ya.
Got some cousins out in france who would wet ya.
International my nigga get those airline miles up.
Plenty bitches here to dial up.
Like an 60's impala.
I lay low as I ride up.
And my main chick a rider.
Ain't no games when I-.
