Neon Eyes Lyrics
by Volumes.

Unworthy target.
It'll take you out regardless.
As I sit here with the television on.
And the sound off.
Commercial after commercial.

I'm so lucky to define it.
By my self regret.
As I perceive narcotic.
Living life always keeping the weight in line.
But then you see the world just like I do.

Feed me until I'm sick.
Drown me out in white.
Drown me out along with everyone.
Not even here to fight this fight.

Burn it all as I sit back and watch discussions.
Not to be heard when I watch you talk, forget it.
Neon eyes always seeing the darker side.
But then you'll see the world just like I do.

Unworthy target.
Let me tell you right now.
He doesn't give a fuck.
See him walking down the freeway.
And it's twelve o' clock.
But I see him standing tall.
He's held up in an office on the 20th floor.
He turns it off.
He turns it all off.

The power to my city as we know it.
The power to my city as we know it.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

On my knees.
And I worship you with every pore.
I'd snort it all, I'd snort it all.

It's called addiction.
Caught up in the system.
The friction of feeling constructed.
Oh I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost.

Without a depiction.
My soul's a victim afflicted.
I know I'm a sick kid.
Oh I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone.

Drown me out along with everyone.
Not even here to fight this fight.
Unworthy target.
