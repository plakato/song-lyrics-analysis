Don't Wanna Go Away Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man.
They just don't understand.
Though young I'm still a man.
Noone can tell me I don't need you here in my life.
They call it puppy love.
But I've lived long enough.
To know these feelings I feel are for real to me.
And I know I....

3rd Storee.
1- Don't wanna go away.
I really wanna stay with you.
But I don't have no say.
For all we have is today.
Said all we have today.

Lil'Man.
They think it's easy to.
Just pack our bags and move.
They just don't know that it means.
So much more to me.
Know if I had my way.
There would never come a day.
That I'd allow us to be so far apart.
And I know I....

3rd Storee.
2- Don't wanna go away.
I really wanna stay with you.
But I don't have no say.
For all we have is today.

Lil'Man.
I just keep on looking up in the sky.
Fighting back the tears.
That keep coming to my eyes.
Really hoping to catch me a falling star.
To make a wish upon.
And change the way things are, make it stop.

Lil'Man.
Said all we have is today.
Said all we have is today.
