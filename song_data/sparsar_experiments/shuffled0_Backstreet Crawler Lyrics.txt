Backstreet Crawler Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler.
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler.
Where I learned to make the little man bleed.
That's when I got stomped like a cattle stampede.
Yeah I'm broken and torn I've never been free.
Where your ego meets defeat and your pride can't get no smaller.
I through the first punch that's when he hit the ground.
I snuck around the corner he had this guy down.

I guess you might say it sure is a shame.
To survive in the street you gotta win the first round.

Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler.
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler.
I used to have everything oh how my life has changed.
I'm a backstreet crawler.

Daddy paid for college I earned a degree.
Got a job up on Wall Street.
When you see them on the concrete it's their spirit that's harder.
Lost everything that meant a thing to me.
Had a nervous breakdown all my friends and family left me.

Because if you want eat you gotta be the baddest one around.
