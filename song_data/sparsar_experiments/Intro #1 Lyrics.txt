Intro #1 Lyrics
by Swish.


Lets get it man.

Im in a different type of situation.
Im a young nigga so i gotta stay patient.
Niggas never hesitate to give out information.
But you can catch me at the top standing ovation.
They always take the best.
Fuck the opps, fuck the rest.
Pull up in all black im bout to express.
Put that chrome to your chest.
Put that chrome where he guess.
I dont fucken care if i left a mess.
Yeah.
And Im out to drill.
Cause niggas out to kill.
If my plate empty imma take your meal.
Im never by myself cause im with the steel.
This shit ain't fake this shit is real uh.
And i Aim the red dots.
Refresh his thoughts im big boss.
Brought it to his spot i gotta go hard shoot.
Shots but no guard .22 in that shit so i gotta hit em.
All.

I be running shit around this place tech nine in the case.
So loud like a base.
Yall niggas ain't save i make your goons run a race.
Freddy Kurger shit ,hallows and the.

Going hard for my team michael jordan shit.
Catch me at the top i be koolin it.
If i see a opp i swear im fooling him uh.
What time is?
Watch the clock.
I keep a Glock.
With alot of shots if he acting hard.
I cock it back.
And niggas saying duck but i ain't never scared.
Run up on me its not gon be fair.
Cause my hittaz here and there.
They dont fucken care.
Realest out imma go now.
Same fake shit that i won't accept.
What do you except?
Get or right or get left.
We just might take your breath.
And im always getting cash dont get.
gashed.
Caught him by himself, you know i had to blast.
I let it off.
Niggas talking crazy i just let them watch.
I got my head up gotta, keep one hand up.
Niggas fed up so dont get wet up.

I was about to stop but i remembered why i started.
Turn nothing into something thats why i even started.
Young nigga tryna make it big.
Tryna get it quick.
It doesn't take a genius to figure out this shit.
Every line i sumbit.
Every line that i spit.
Real niggas niggas know this.
And real niggas dont quick.
