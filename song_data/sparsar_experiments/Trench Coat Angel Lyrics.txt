Trench Coat Angel Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.


Last night, under city lights.
I was wandering.
Across the street, he stared at me.
7 feet, a trench coat angel.
Through a smokey haze, he looked my way.
And said, could I have minute please?
I have something you need.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
At least you know you're livin.
The debts and pain, from when you strayed.
Well man, all's forgiven.
All's forgiven.

I've seen it all, the rise and fall.
Ten thousand years of living.
From Rome to Spain, Berlin, L.A.
People still pretending.
You fight your wars, but what's it for.
Trust me, they're never ending.
You better wake up, the end is your beginning.

Love, it is enough.
When it comes to us.
Let's make it right.

Love, it is enough.
When it comes to us.
We'll make it right.

Love, it is enough.
When it comes to us.
We'll make it right.
