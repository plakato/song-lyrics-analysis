I Wanna Be In The Mob Lyrics
by The Swellers.

I wanna be in the mob. I wanna shoot you dead. I wanna eat a pizza with the.
don then shoot him in the head. I wanna be in the mob. I wanna push some.
crack. I want a shirt that costs more than a car and I want a Cadillac. I'm.
sick of working at Sbarro's tossing dough. I wanna own a restaurant where.
families go, and then I'll burn it down. I wanna be in the mob. And then I'll.
burn it down. I wanna be in the mob.
