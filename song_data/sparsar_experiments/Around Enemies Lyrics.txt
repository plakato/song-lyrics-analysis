Around Enemies Lyrics
by Unonimus.

Look around . . .you see all these snots next to you?
Believe it or not, they're scheming a plot just for you.
They say they're your friends and treat you like God's best just to.
Take advantage while you still think it's just all vegetables.
Carrots and peas, whatever, you never can see reality.
Bet you can see the pleasure in everything you've found to be.
Fame and admiration, respect for just being how you be.
Yeah, they'll always be there, unless they don't need your talents.
Because you ain't nothing to them, you're just another tool.
Another pawn, another piece to their newest puzzle fool.
Man, why can't you see their using you?
Can't you see they only even noticed you because you know how to beat a.
Rubik's Cube?
Didn't mean to get that personal.
But what's so wrong with a nerd keeping a rap journal?
In a middle school of cynical and idiotic imbeciles.
Who brag about their clothes and then kid about their genitals.
Guess I don't fit their rapper image.
I don't wear the freshest styles or get the baddest women.
I'm a skinny average kid with a different hat of tricks.
A rabbit up his sleeve and a fist that hasn't hit.
I hear, but without listening.
And don't try to talk, cause I fear that I'll sound differently from them.
So now my brains full of foul memories.
I guess that's what I get for hanging around enemies.
