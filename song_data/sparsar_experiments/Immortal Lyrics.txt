Immortal Lyrics

The turning of the stars bring a time when my secrets can give you immortality.
But when that time has passed, those fleeting minutes gone, the secret is.
worthless.
Until once again the stars unlock its power.

My life is like an eternal cyclone.
I could guess but I never know where I'm going.
I'm dying on the inside but I don't show it.
I just stand before you, I am immortal.
I am immortal.

He is a storyteller turned poet and when given the mic.
He holds it then chokes it with words that you won't spit.
And it is a given that he don't shit especially not for a hoe or bitch.
But if you ain't an idiot he might show you some respect.

goodbye.
And if you ever need a shoulder to cry on, yeah, promise I am that guy.
Notice the switch up? That means two sides on this coin.
And the room is big and wide if you wanting to join.
And I feel anytime I could die so when I'm gone.
Remember that I always tried at whatever it was.
I wanted to better because I ruined everything at once.
All of it gone in a blink, it's done.
But when it's all over, I climb from the rubble.
Attempting to fix anything, my rebuttal.
But I'm just trapped and stuck in this bubble.
I'm broken yet untouchable, fuck it.

There was a time when immortality seemed the way to enchantment and happiness,.
now I yearn for death....
