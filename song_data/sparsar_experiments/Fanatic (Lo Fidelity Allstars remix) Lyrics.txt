Fanatic (Lo Fidelity Allstars remix) Lyrics
by Vivian Green.

When I wake up all I want is for him to take me away.
To that incredible comfort zone inside that beautiful place.
It's where I need to release tension so that I can feel brand new.
And reach that height that only one in this whole world can take me to.

All the time I want you baby, all the time i need you honey, all the time i.
gotta have you sugar.
Because I'm addicted.
Allthe time i want you baby all the time i need you honey all the time i gotta.
have you sugar.
It belongs to me.

I'm fanatically addicted see the way that he be loving me.
Its like a drug or sokme bad habit.
Since its mine i got to have it.

Feels like, like ive never had it right.
Cuz before this.
There was so much emotional pain nothing positive to gain.
But im loved full and completely now.
Not just a physical thang.
But its something spiritual.

I just got to have it Ii'm a fanatic.
I just got to hav it im a fanatic.
I just got to have it im a fanatic.
I just got ot hae it im a fanatic.
