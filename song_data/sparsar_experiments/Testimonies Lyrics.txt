Testimonies Lyrics
by Swoop G.

** 
 
Mobb shit, bitch, that's all them raps in my notebook finally paid off 
Testimonies of a gangsta. 9-7 
 
Most fantasise. I despise a nigga 
Who violate the game by casting dirt upon my name. 
Cuz I've been summoned from the vallies of hell. 
At the same time them shells dropped them. Niggas fell, 
You, claim you ballin, but I can't tell 
About your bitch, you fit 
Now. You can't afford bail 
Like, I dispose of toilet paper. I dispose of them fists, 
You, can't fuck wit. This Mobb-stylist so keep bitin yo lip 
Niggas, wan na see me lose, but ain't no room for error. 
Finally got a thick bitch. Now you scared to share her 
There's, a coward umong us. I detect his sent. 
I won't point no fingers nigga, but I said what I meant: 
Ain't no snitches in my streets Chris, I come wit, slugs 
Nigga, wash Tide. An Bleach can't fade this thug 
Give it up 
Live it up playa, expose your heart 
At. My best I rip flesh like a Great White shark, 
That's, real 
Po-po raids and barricades, can't stop us 
As a shout out beg center for AK's and choppers 
In the Bay. I must pray for the municable jury, 
There's. No way man can survive the decent of my fury, 
I married, Nina Ross 
Cuz she's, my hoodrat pal 
We got engaged the day. I pulled her out that bathroom towel 
I be ridin on that highway to heaven cuz I paid the toll 
It costed more than a dollar, so I gave my soul 
The pain from my past. It can't be disguised 
I, been baptised in fire watch the flames. In my eyes, 
Nigga 
2 Scoops assembling soldiers to ride in unison, 
PD's got AP's out for all us, hoolagans 
The dirt. I'Ve done I'd be willing to do again. 
As long as the bitch ass niggas I'd love to shoot again. 
Mama raised me well wakin up to them grits 
Kept it real and made all the playas praise. My shit 
Got discovered like a fossil or the secret of the ooze 
I, had to steal, because I refused to wear them. Payless shoes, 
Teacher, told me she'll, be back in a minute. 
I think she knows. 
My optimst prime lunch pale 
My twamp sacks in it 
I'm gettin, suspicious 
Niggas 
They askin too many questions. 
They know my new Pope 100's be my prized. Possesion 
Streets has got these niggas heartless. 
They ain't got no manners. 
When we run out of chronic. Do we resort to the bammers 
Sometimes? I wonder my mama. Don'T approve of me 
Humiliated by the fact that her son's a G 
Heaven has an admission and your hearts to feed 
Spotlight. Would you please shine bright on me, 
 
**, x2 
 
As. I get violent and physical 
Wit my strap to your mental 
Soon as I enter the reconstruction wit. This 12 gage pistol 
We handle the ghostrider 
We live and die through these hardcore. Raps 
Heaven will find a way to follow us down. This dark course path: 
Testimonies 
, 
*, 
 
I would like to take the time out to give credit to the cities of 
Frisco Vallejo Oakland Sacramento for manufacturing, so many talented, 
Niggas and giving us money-motivated hustlas an opprotunity to pursue a 
Legitamate career in this twisted game Called life., I truley hope after 
Hearing, my album, my songs will influence my fans to retire smoke. 
Bigger hope for better., Don't be content, wit. The circumstances cuz 
Most of these circumstances are only temporary. Can't nobody hold you 
Back from changin them. Music has given the testimonies of us gangstas a 
Voice. Amen,
