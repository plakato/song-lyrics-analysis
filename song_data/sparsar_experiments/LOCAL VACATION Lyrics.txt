Local Vacation.
Music produced &amp; recorded by: Phil N. DeBlank.

It's about time we accept that reality for what it is.
Milwaukee is ground zero , yeah it's terror where we live.
So don't profile yourself trying to fit into that stereotype.
They said you better know that ledge , and don't believe that hype.

This situation is confrontation , they tactics is intimidation.
They scared as what?
With guns and tear gas and armored trucks.
The military occupation , or your local police station.
They dash cam or your cell phone, gone press record on'em.
And exercise your rights for the rest of your life.
This that survival talk Milwaukee walk with ya head up.
Citizens protesting finally getting fed up.
No justice for the victims in a one sided system.
Listen get organized before the cries arrive, I'm sayin....
Dont be waiting on no tragedy or brutality to build up your family audacity.
And emergency plan.

We gone fight for the future so our babies make it to the top.
We might not get there with them but hey, this is Hip Hop.
Cause when you step up in that cross fire , its more than a promo.
Im that B-Boy stance in that Public Enemy logo.
LL Vivafidel that shooting star on a sunny day.
They all know me well from what I do, not what I say.
We speaking from the heart.
We ain't reaching, chasing charts.
Your best list or your guest list or your wish-list is useless.
I'm timeless, we can't let'em use our own kind as agents against us.
Giving trinkets , incentives.
Like emcees think it's sweet till they meet me on a beat.
And I'm setting slaves free.
The revolutionary never cut with the scary.
So you can keep your apologists and your little fairies.
I'm a critical physiologist , naturally a novelist.
Motivational giant have you looking up to an optimist.
Long live Fidel talking that rebellion.
Let's link up after the session taking action is the essence, yeah.
Taking action is the essence.
