Flatline Lyrics
by UNK.


Let's fuck his ass up! {*4X*}.
We fucked his ass up! {*4X*}.
Now call the ambulance! {*4X*}.
Flatliiiine~! {*4X*}.

Unk.
Fo'-fo' ducked off in my Chevy, let's fuck his ass up.
And if a hater buck, let's beat they ass up.
I'm black ski-masked up, whatever is whatever.
I'm watchin niggas posted mixin fruits and goose together.
I keep that black Beretta, I call that bitch my heater.
And if you play me close just like a bitch man I'mma skeet ya.
Them Western twins'll meet'cha, can greet'cha like a feature.
And change up all your features, call the Red Cross to treat'cha.
The club is off the meters, they crunk they doin they dance.
Security better check 'em, or we gon' throw them hands.
Now A-Town stomp that ass, watch me bow his ass up.
Call the ambulance cause now you fucked.
Ready to pick yo' ass up, and take you on the stretcher.
We fucked his ass up, I hope that God bless ya.
Your team ain't here to help ya, you don't want it with us.
I told you that we gangsters, let's fuck his ass up.

Unk.
Is he gone?  Lil' shorty dead.
He bust a move  We rocked his dreads.
Fo' to your dome  I split your wig.
I'mma grown-ass man, I don't play with fuckin kids.
These niggas swear they hard, these hoes think they bad.
But when it comes to beef, they all act like drags.
Sissies punks and fags, yo' life is slippin fast.
I hope you go to heaven, 2Pac gon' kick yo' ass.
I think you need to breathe, I'm cold so niggas chill.
Smoke you a blunt or kush, go try to get a deal.
Niggas bustin f'real, Big Oomp we tote the steel.
DJ Unk off in the 'llac, ready to twist yo' cap back f'real.
