Bad Heart Lyrics
by Wray.


Your head is so wild.
Your head is so wild.
Been talking awhile, yeah.
Been talking awhile.
It's so easy.

This thing is benign.
I'm looking behind.
You're gonna be fine, yeah.
You're gonna be fine.
And you know it.

It's a strange course.
It's a strange course.
There's no bad heart, yeah.
There's no bad heart.
It's a blessing.

Your head is so wild.
Your head is so wild.
Your head is so wild, yeah.
Your head is so wild, yeah.
Your head is so wild, yeah.
Your head is so wild.

It's a strange course.
It's a strange course.
