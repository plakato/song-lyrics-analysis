On The Rise Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


My niggas call me Turbo 
And. I hope it sound familiar 
Cause. If it don't, then let me fill you in 
Behind. The scenes is where I been 
Yeah. I got an ego 
But. I don't need no attention 
Future, physician 
Followed by heaven 
So, why stress 
I'm, just living on the rise? No bitching, 
I wan na be proud of me. 
Fuck, the bank balance 
But enough philosophy, 
Here's the motherfucking talent 
Ayo. My rhymes is timeless. 

I find this beat priceless. Like Cherry Wine is 
So, I kindly say silence with your rhyme diss 
Snatch, your finest diamonds leave you with blindness. 
Triple T we not spineless 
Call us your highness 
Or you sinus will be caught up in your mind. Bitch 
, 
We, don't know what it is. We, after 
But, we stay up on the rise, 
X4 
 
Man. What can I say, 
We stay far out and away. 
My eyes are red and all glazed 
Repping Two-Three for days 
We, keep you walking, which way 
I'm feeling awkward and strange 
We are confound, not deranged. 
We play you out like some strings. 
We can't say what the future brings. 
But we LeBron sonic, knuckle them rings, 
Two Tan, and that's what we sing 
We on the rise 
Like we some bling, 
Is it Versace or is it some Mink 
So tell em Thought like what do you think 
 
On the rise 
Yeah? It'S no surprise no lie. 
We'Re chained to the game until we die 
First class fly into the sky 
To, let the pain, subside 
If! You fail well. At least you tried 
Cause. We grind like some 
Trucks on a line: 
Divine rhymes in fine times, 
Inclined signs telling me not to drop mines. 
Show in pro time, 
With fractions, climbing up
on my mind 
Sad, but true 
My mouth loose, like ladders with no chutes 
I rep, the tre deuce, because we rap fluent 
Freezing like a coolant 
Refreshing like a fluid 
Undoing the ruins and teach it to my students. 
All about this movement 
Hoping that me and my money become congruent. 
This is how I do it
