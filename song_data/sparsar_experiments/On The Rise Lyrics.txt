On The Rise Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


My niggas call me Turbo.
And I hope it sound familiar.
Cause if it don't then let me fill you in.
Behind the scenes is where I been.
Yeah I got an ego.
But I don't need no attention.
Future physician.
Followed by heaven.
So why stress.
I'm just living on the rise no bitching.
I wanna be proud of me.
Fuck the bank balance.
But enough philosophy.
Here's the motherfucking talent.
Ayo my rhymes is timeless.

I find this beat priceless like Cherry Wine is.
So I kindly say silence with your rhyme diss.
Snatch your finest diamonds leave you with blindness.
Triple T we not spineless.
Call us your highness.
Or you sinus will be caught up in your mind bitch.

We don't know what it is we after.
But we stay up on the rise.
X4.

Man what can I say.
We stay far out and away.
My eyes are red and all glazed.
Repping Two-Three for days.
We keep you walking which way.
I'm feeling awkward and strange.
We are confound not deranged.
We play you out like some strings.
We can't say what the future brings.
But we LeBron sonic knuckle them rings.
Two Tan and that's what we sing.
We on the rise.
Like we some bling.
Is it Versace or is it some Mink.
So tell em Thought like what do you think.

On the rise.
Yeah it's no surprise, no lie.
We're chained to the game until we die.
First class fly into the sky.
To let the pain subside.
If you fail, well at least you tried.
Cause we grind like some.
Trucks on a line.
Divine rhymes in fine times.
Inclined signs telling me not to drop mines.
Show in pro time.
With fractions climbing up.
on my mind.
Sad but true.
My mouth loose like ladders with no chutes.
I rep the tre deuce because we rap fluent.
Freezing like a coolant.
Refreshing like a fluid.
Undoing the ruins and teach it to my students.
All about this movement.
Hoping that me and my money become congruent.
This is how I do it.
