Grape Jelly Lyrics
by Yung 69 & 0ld 420.


Yung yolo.
Everyday wearing a polo.
I own a yoyo.
Sometimes i bounce on the pogo.
I drink OJ without the Mayo.
Whoa.
You are an average Joe.
And your mother is a ho.
Your car is really slow.
Every time you rap i say NO.
I ball hard.
Just like a young Rashard.
I got a really big yard.
And i spit these bars free of charge.
Yung 69 is the best.
And i didn't even have to get dressed.

Waddup Yung 69.
I heard you like to 69.
They call me 0ld 420.
Cuz I like to smoke 420.
Driving a foreign whip, trying not to crash.
But it's really hard while I'm gettin' all of this ass.
From your mom and your sister.
Not tryna catch a case if you know what I mean.
I'm still rappin' though, keepin' it real.
Remindin' negus of that young niqqa Bradley Beal.
In the club with about a trillion bad bitches.
Just filled a mass grave with about a trillion bad snitches.
0ld 420 back to make them pussies wet again.
Fuck a French girl with my big baguette again.
RIP to Chris Farley yeah you know a niqqa miss him.
But I named my dick Chris so your mom still can kiss him.
