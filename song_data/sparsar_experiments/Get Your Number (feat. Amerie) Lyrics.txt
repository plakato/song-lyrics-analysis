Get Your Number (feat. Amerie) Lyrics
by Yung Berg.


Listen I know we been through our.
Ups and downs but you cheated and broke.
My heart I gave you a second chance.
But you never gave up so... well I'm going.
To sing to ya to get you to understand.
Baby listen up it's sad news.

Ooooh! Yeah.

Sigh's.

I love ya but I'm sorry I just.
Gotta let ya go baby listen.

Baby listen!

Look but baby stop cryin' I know it's hard.
But what you did to me really broke my heart.
And babe I know your sorry and I forgive you.
But we just gotta just be friends so don't act.
Like you don't know so ya know what.
I'm bout to do.

This has to be the hardest thang I ever done.
Desbite all the ups and downs our love was fun.
But you cheated on me like twice and it made me cry.
So I think it's time to say goodbye.

Look but baby stop cryin' I know it's hard.
But what you did to me really broke my heart.
And babe I know your sorry and I forgive you.
But we just gotta just be friends so don't act.
Like you don't know so ya know what.
I'm bout to do.

Baby I gotta let you go, cause I can't.
Be with you nomore baby I know your heart.
Is breaking but how you think I feel.
You cheated on me felt like as if my heart.
Was killed baby I'm sorry but....

and it wasn't from you.
Not loving me good it's just you cheated on me.
Like I wasn't the one baby I loved you so I gotta.
Give you up what I'm tryna say is I....

{Gotta... Let You Go Listen! }.

Walkin' in school hopin' to catch up with you.
Saw you with another dude got me wonna hit you.
But that's not a man thing to do and I ain't gon hurt you.
But say it's through but I'm a sing it to you baby.
I love ya but I gotta say goodbye.

{Cause! }.

Baby I gotta let you go, cause I can't.
Be with you nomore baby I know your heart.
Is breaking but how you think I feel.
You cheated on me felt like as if my heart.
Was killed baby I'm sorry but....

and it wasn't from you.
Not loving me good it's just you cheated on me.
Like I wasn't the one baby I loved you so I gotta.
Give you up what I'm tryna say is I....

{Gotta... Let You Go Listen! }.

BreakDown:.
Baby I thought our love would grow.
But you cheated on me so I gotta let you know.
That it's over so I gotta let you go.

Baby when I was there you never.
Really acted that you cared but I was.
Surprised that a kiss was the only thing we shared.

{Gotta Let You Go}.

Music Stops For A Breif Mintue.

Oooooh, Yeah Uuuum.
Gotta let you go Woah Woah.
I said put ya hands up in the air if ya had.
Someone you loved but they never.
Cared I said.

Put ya hands up in the air if ya had.
Someone you loved but they never.
Cared.

{Gotta Let You Go}.

Baby I gotta let you go, cause I can't.
Be with you nomore baby I know your heart.
Is breaking but how you think I feel.
You cheated on me felt like as if my heart.
Was killed baby I'm sorry but....

Gotta Let Ya Goooo!

and it wasn't from you.
Not loving me good it's just you cheated on me.
Like I wasn't the one baby I loved you so I gotta.
Give you up what I'm tryna say is I....

{Gotta Let You Go}.
