Freddie Foxxx Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.

.
It's the youngest lynguists coming with the stunning english.
Tongue and fingers in your broad's heart performing cunnilingus.
.
Make her soul cum, heard of a full atman orgasm?.
Your whore has 'em, like full body with even more spasms.
Your whore'll report she's at my fort for oral support.
Don't be a poor sport cuz I store more in the shorts.
Or try to quarrel in court or this war'll be short.
Stupid ass, shooting back at the Lord with mortal retorts.
It's Unorthodocks, opposite of Freddie Foxxx.
Get ready I'm coming jetti with the medi on my socks.
He said he turn the petty into confetti when he rocks.
Never freezing even when the cops steady many Glocks.
Invest in my penny stocks, use them as building blocks.
To be a bandcamp billionaire soon as my album drops.
But, talent flops even if your boy's styling hot.
Dope beats with a dome piece deep as Alan Watts.
I'm wilding with violent thoughts more vile than Stalingrads.
But I just smile and nod cuz meenwhile I'm piling wads.
.
So cats of soft consistancy are falling off consistnantly.
.
