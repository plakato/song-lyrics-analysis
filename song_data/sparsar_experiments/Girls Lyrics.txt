Girls Lyrics

H-town.
Only for the ladies.
Uptown, south side, east side.
On the way down to the south side.
We love them girls.

VIP, drinks on me.
Dresscode is, sexy chic.
On second thought.
Let me take that off.
Let me see you naked.
Baby drop that bra.
All I wanna be, is where you are.

Houston girls.
Atlanta girls.
Cali girls.
Miami girls.
D-twon girls.
Toronto girls.
New York girls.
All my girls.

I love 'em from the ?
I love 'em educated.
I love 'em all flavors.
I love 'em natural with no make-up.
I love all the.

Houston girls.
