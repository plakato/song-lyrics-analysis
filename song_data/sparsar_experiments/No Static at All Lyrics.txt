No Static at All Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

No static at alllllll....

MC Serch.
Beef not needed to waste one.
Cause trouble don't feed the bass drum.
Some so feeble, so play the hoodlum.
A humdrum liver in bedlam.
Bet your last buck, you don't laugh to this.
Your horse came last behind the cactus.
Back so strong, you thought wrong a fallacy.
The groove will whip and flip cause it has to be.
In there, like Belvedere in his underwear.
On the new year, my dear, so make it clear.
I'm gonna ask do you wanna live small?
Static? Nah troop, none at all.

Pete Nice.
Why meddle in the middle of a ruckus.
? sip slowly on Snapple in hand.
Not these hands of mine holdin clippers.
Slip and clip your flat-top to ceasar.
Ease your ego, I go toe to toe.
Throw my voice like I throw my yo-yo.
And ho ho ho, on the mic is life support.
And toward a crumb static ain't my sport.
I swing to this, Serch swings to that.
And as you noticed, they always wear hats.
Boots and loops produced by Prince Paul.
Slaps ya skull, no static at all.

...

MC Serch.
Static mixed in but it don't cling.
To a fat rope dope Gucci link or an earring.
Hand now gropin for stabbin.
But the hand is used to get skins.
Skim the cream but it seems you still rise.
For some who lives more, now life lifesize.
All are lepers in my swingdom.
Groups and troops get friends and they bring them.
In goes props so pop til the mornin.
Home to the young, pop still snorin.
Wake up you blockhead and heed the call.
Aiyyo, no static at all.

Pete Nice.
I flip on kicks, my DJ tricks.
The a.k.a code name Richie Rich.
Daddy Rich, you never watch him on TV?

Full on 1210's flippin the beats.
*Richie Rich cuts more*.
Some bust nuts, Daddy Rich bust cuts.
Such transform over rhythms on dust.
I rush this rhythm, hold like Mingus.
I swing this joint, no static to sting this.
*Richie Rich cuts more*.

Nice A bitch's brew, who snappin gyro.
Serch Scabs can't craft what only the fly knows.
Nice Got skins all in on schemin'.

Nice I'm seemin vexed in my rhymin texts.
Serch Opened up shop to chop off the hairnets.
Nice I put off punks like junk so sporadic.
Serch Stashed away like old drawers in my attic.
Nice Or drawers on my legs, figures what I says.
Serch Snack on Jolly Rancher or Orange Pez.
Nice Yep this ain't no collect call.
Serch So peace, yo Pete.
Nice No static at all.
Serch True!
