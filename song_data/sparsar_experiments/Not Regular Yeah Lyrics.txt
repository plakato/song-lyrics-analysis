Not Regular Yeah Lyrics
by Wolfman D.

I attack like cholesterol.
On the heart, compress the chest of all.
Obese schoolboys taking the test.
And its stressing ya'll.
You kids sleep in class.
You need to learn the lesson.
I have twice your brain power.
But it keeps me second guessing ya'll.

Inhale the fumes.
Blow the powder into the eyes.
Of the elephant in the room.
Then kill it.
Sell the tusks to the bulls Pamplona.
Yep, even the Spanish.
Know they can't escape my doom.

Zoom zoom, bang bang.
A bunch of onomatopoeias.
Scare the fleet of PETA members.
Swarmin at me, I dismember.
Jive-turkeys in December.
Or even a Christmas goose.
Taking niggas out like trash.
With the fury I'm letting loose.

Give me a boost over this fence.
Is what they cry out.
When they see Wolfman with a sling shot.
Shooting eyes out.
Yeah, you'd best beware.
Oh yeah?
But not regular yeah.
Hell Yeah.

When I do it to 'em.
I make habitats into ruins.
They're like yo, this man is killin.
This villain is ill as flu.
And I'm killing it.
Rhymes are cuttin like scissors on the paper.
Hotter than the latent heat.
Of ammonia to vapors.

I'm hot as ever.
My rhymes are like saunas.
I dehydrate drunks.
And niggas get smoked like marijuana.
And I dont do drugs.
Although I'm losing street-cred.
But i like to stay sober when I tease.
Beer and weed-heads.

Who wants to get dirty with dirty D?
I'm infamously nerdy.
Just pretend.
You never heard of me.
Loud-mouths get tracheotomies.
The sterile need no vasectomies.
Feminine rhymers try to best me.
So I'd give them hysterectomies.

No lives will be spared.
I feed pretenders a chalice of my leg hairs.
Then call all of my friends for a ride to my lair.
My niggas be like yeah.
But not regular yeah.
Hell Yeah.

The smartest man could bet his manhood.
I'll punish even the worst ill parented.
Non-planned hoods.
I don't think any man would.
My rhymes are just too lame.
I guess they can't stand good.

Fickle phony fallacies.
Of future fetuses.
Will likely be the offspring.
Of Butt-heads and Beavises.
I catch more wreck about.
My lack of rigidity.
For than the common population.
For an abundance of stupidity.

I'm a hungry pest.
You fools can't get rid of me.
You trying to change the inner-me.
You'll need a stronger enthalpy.
The things I have are meant for me.
The Red Bull gives you energy.
I eat lightening, crap thunder.
And expectorate entropy.

I do the work on all these tracks I'm slaying.
Make you listen to me carefully to hear what I'm saying.
When I'm playing truth or double dare.
I always choose triple dare.
And make them say Yeah.
But not regular yeah.
HELL YEAH.
