Game Time Lyrics
by Z-Mane.


Look....
This is how it's gonna go down, we finna throw down.
Somebody call up Omi, this a Xiaolin Showdown.
These niggas always telling jokes, but ain't got no punch lines.
And if they hungry for them hands, then I guess it's crunch time.
I need some sleep because I'm tired of lames.
If they ain't hooping or touching down, I'm tired of games.
Excuse the title, though, I told you niggas I don't play.
I just go and put in work, and yep, your boy get pay.
Green is all I see like I keep it my main focus.
I got that magical spit, but don't call it hocus pocus.
Witchcraft, trick bad, , grain wood.
Wish a nigga would, but I doubt that nigga even could.
You can't touch me, trust me, it's impossible.
Cause when it's game time, mane, I'm nearly unstoppable.

It's game time, yeah, it's game time.
Naw, I ain't playing, but nigga, it's game time.
You gets no play time, nigga, this game mine.
I tell 'em I ain't playing, but nigga, it's game time.

Gon' tell em it's on, it's on!
It's game time..

Ayo, it's M.I.C., I'm bout to make some history.
These times are crazy, I'm a truth in a daze.
I'm tryna get back in position of my lucrative ways.
But you have no idea how much this scrutiny weighs.
But I don't know how to stop my ways.
So I keep on smoking on this fucking blunt until my worries go away.
But I might also smoke on my fucking vapor, I don't know.
This music is my life, I'm not old, I'm new.
So get off your ass and brew me some stew.
Because me and Zalen go H.A.M. like fucking one and two.
My first time on the mic, I'm not doing so bad, so don't hate.
This is my time to shine, this is my game, so don't blame me.
This is my life now, so I'm gonna roll a blunt and lay down.
Cause it's almost fucking game time now!

Gon' tell em it's on, it's on!
It's game time..

Yeah!
Shoutout to all my niggas out there doing they thing.
You know what I'm saying?
It's always game time.
Shoutout to the boy Matt Chandler.
Z-Mane!
