All Your Faithless Loyalties Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Confession's of the brakeman's son.
Vindicating setting sun.
Look back at what you've done.
You can't forgive.

In the costumes of complacencies.
Crime is worse than they can see.
Beauty torn so tastelessly.
It's all you give.

All your faithless loyalties.
They won't give me no rest.
But I got little else to defend.

Sure you've seen better but.
For you I did my best.
But oh no, I go faithlessly my friend.
When I know I can win.

Revolving door of Alabam.
Looks your way with vicious plans and.
It's where she always cleans her hands.
But don't give in.

Cause when the mouths are far between.
Something in your conscience screams.
Lipstick on a guillotine.
Darling caved in.

Think of me, sweet baby.
When your head is in the west.
If you need me, I'll be out in the wind.

I'm sure that you've seen better.
For you I did my best.
But as I go by, think of you my friend.
When I know I can win.

In the streets of sweetwaters.
The daughters of an ancortez.
Break their bodies for their bread.
It's the strangest thing.

Kiss themselves by candlelight.
Lips of red and robes of white.
Out to pulverize the night.
I can't complain.

Keep a coat against the cold.
And lilly 'gainst your breast.
There's something o'er the hills.
I must attend.

I'm sure that you've seen better.
But for you I did my best.
But I know I go patiently my friend.
When I know I can win.

Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.
