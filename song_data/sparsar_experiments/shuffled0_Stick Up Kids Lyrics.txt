Stick Up Kids Lyrics
by Wu Block.

You can walk up and smack 'em.
I'mma lick 'em.
But if not I'mma burrr stick 'em.
Word! Awe shit!
Its gonna be a long day.
Im looking at your chains.
Keep taking about that money.
They so soft.

My son said daddy if he move.
Mama said stick 'em.
Let alone a ratchet.
Around the crew like a grammy.
My grandmother go to church.
Mama said stick 'em.
Credit cards, debit cards.
To pray on my victims she say.
But where we gonna ship 'em.
Wedding bands, birthstones.
You ain't even gotta jack 'em.
Like chill par relax.

Donnie on his bullshit.
Yea my cloth is cut different.
Let her tell us where to get him.
Big shit, all the way.
Ha ha ha stick 'em.
I'mma lick 'em.
My little man with autusim.
Get my hand on the hawk I'mma stick 'em.
Prolly better to kill 'em.
My daughter said stick 'em.
To pray on my victims she say.
I don't care its waever homes.
Slow when I strip 'em.
Hoppin' out the whip.

C alar ripped him.
I'mma lick 'em.
Cause he can't take the whipping.
Camouflage, earth tones.
Ya know I'mma slim nigga.
Send a bitch home wit him.
My grandmother go to church.
Down to the heron bones.
Cut the jewels.
We hardly get caught with our hoodies off.
You barely need a gun.
Ha, ha, ha stick 'em.
To just listen.
Her maid just got enough.
Vvs clarity.
Maps for this hallway.

Usually make 'em take it off.
Ripped the Jules off his neck.
He said ship me, I'm not giving it up.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stick 'em.
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em.
My daughter said stick 'em.
I ain't even gotta koll em.
And looked at duke and said stick 'em.

Fuck it I just draw a door to me duck.
To pray on my victims she say.
He looked at me.
My daughter said stick 'em.
Cause them diamond look clearer.
Hand on the 4.
I'm just coming for that raw.

It don't cost nothing.
From a large family.
Lay him down on the floor.
My other homie downstairs.
I'mma stick 'em.
Everybody get god.
This how we do it in Staten.
ARA is the armed robbers academy.
Why ya looking at me stick 'em.
Aids needle I'mma stick 'em.
That fact should be up north.
I hope you remove the body.
Understand it came through.
Ima stick 'em.

The burner get passed.
Doc had to staple his face.
Mama said stick 'em.
Consider it charity.
Mask and a full clip.
My son said daddy if he move.
Can't wait to sic 'em.
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em.
Got the hollows in that ruger.
My mans at the door.
Straight victim.
Home still smelling like ajax.
My grandmother go to church.
My son said daddy if he move.
Than that water in Aruba.
Got the red nose off the leash.
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em.
Then you got the rats.
Put it in the bag.
