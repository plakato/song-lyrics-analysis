Mationaire Lyrics
by Sydney.

I wish I could devastate you.
Calculate, manipulate you.
And if I had the guts to save you.
Would you have the poise and grace to.
And these conversations that take a little bit from you.
And a lot from me your right.
There's no debating when your friends think that they know me but they're so.
wrong.

All I wanted.
It's kinda funny how its all I got and.
I never realized that your shoulder could get so cold.
And now I'm on my own and I'm off to New Jersey to sing it.

Don't take it back cause you know i wanna say it.
Don't hold your breath cause you know i wanna see it.
I'll hold you to this, you know ill do it.
I'm sure he loved every line you swear you never fed.
I guess we're passing time but I'd be better off dead.

All I wanted.
It's kinda funny how it's all I got and.
I never realized that your shoulder could get so cold.
And now I'm on my own and I'm off to New Jersey to sing it.

What's the point if you don't have to try it.
You said it, I get it.
A simple thought and reaction I'll tear you apart.
I said it, you get it.

So don't make me.

All I wanted.
It's kinda funny how it's all I got and.
I never realized that your shoulder could get so cold.
And now I'm on my own and I'm off to New Jersey to sing it.

This cold night i caught it again.
My frantic breath it fills the air.
Just breath out and ill breath you in.
I guess it makes less sense when we're trying hard to get to the start.
But know I'm on my own and I'm off to New Jersey to sing it.
