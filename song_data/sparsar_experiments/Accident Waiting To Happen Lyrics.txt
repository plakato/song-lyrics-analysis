Accident Waiting To Happen Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

I've always been impressed with a girl.
Who can sing for her supper and get breakfast as well.
That's the way I am, heaven help me.
He said, We don't like peace campaigners 'round here.
As he nailed another one to the wall.
And that's what gets me in trouble, heaven help me.

Goodbye and good luck to all the rubbish that.
You've spoken.
Goodbye and good luck to all the promises.
You've broken.
Your life has lost its dignity, its beauty, and its passion.
You're an accident waiting to happen.

There you are standing at the bar.
And you're giving me grief about the DDR.
And that chip on your shoulder gets bigger as you.
Get older.
One of these nights you're gonna get caught.
It'll give you a pregnant pause for thought.
You're a dedicated swallower of fascism.

Time up and time out for all the liberties you've taken.
Time up and time out for all the friends that.
You've forsaken.
If you choose to waste away like death is back in fashion.
You're an accident waiting to happen.

And my sins are so unoriginal.
I have all the self-loathing of a wolf in sheep's clothing.
In this carnival of carnivores.
Heaven help me.
