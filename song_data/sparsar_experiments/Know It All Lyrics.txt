Know It All Lyrics
by The Virus.

When it's all been said and done.
And you're out there on your own.
And no one's looking out for you.
Like when you lived at home.
But at the age of sixteen you thought you knew it all.
Hey piss off mom and dad cause I feel pushed against a wall.

So when you think that you know it all and you're rushing to grow up.
Don't alienate those that matter cause you might just push your luck.

After a few weeks of being on your own.
You found it wasn't as easy as when you lived at home.
You miss the free food and your dad's fancy car.
And you're looking at yourself and you don't know who are.

So when you think that you know it all and you're rushing to grow up.
Don't alienate those that matter cause you might just push your luck.
