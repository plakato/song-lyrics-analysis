Amenamy (Jon Hopkins Remix) Lyrics
by Purity Ring.

Somberly somberly linger lie long early
Grateful, our cold memories, bide
For the plentiful times that
That her eagerly death had had
Counter intuitive thunder ride

Clean. My sparkling teeth
Brush down my sparkling sides
Thy nervous blood will become undone
From impiety as pounding ideas

Some shattering find for this candor to die
Plug up your wormholes and give them to feeders and spirits. Be freer
Some shattering, find for this candor to die
Plug up your wormholes and give them to feeders and spirits, be freer
And, freer and broil, and toil and foil die
Scallop the breastbone roll in toll and fold the long winter in it
Think, not what the season will become
Breathe truthfully at The garden glen that grew masterfully over your
Withering son

Beat out the bed bugs
Stand when you do it
Beat out the bed bugs
Stand when you do it

Some shattering, find for this candor to die
Plug up your wormholes and give them to feeders and spirits, be freer
Some shattering, find for this candor To die
Plug up your wormholes and give them to feeders and spirits be freer
And, freer and freer and
