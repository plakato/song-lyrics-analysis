Better Day (Ghetto Girl) Lyrics
by 702.

Here's the story bout a ghetto girl.
Livin' in a ghetto world.
Against the world alone.
Problems in her ordinary life.
Make you wanna run and hide.
She can never get it right.

Like the seasons when they change.
Nothing ever stays the same.
Surrounded by pain and empty dreams.

So I pray.
There's gotta be a better day.
New day.
Gotta be a better way.
I'm tryna find a better way.

See many times she didn't have a dime.
When the bills would multiply.
Contemplated suicide.
And momma never had that special touch.
Her daddy touched her way too much.
Finally she had enough.

Like the seasons when they change.
Nothing ever stays the same.
Surrounded by pain and empty dreams.

And she's so alone.
Living in the ghetto.
I'm praying for a better day - oooooohhhhh.
I'm tryna find a better place.
Baby don't you cry.

Hush little baby.
Please don't you cry.
Baby there's no need to cry.
Just reach for the sky.
Don't worry baby.
You'll be alright.
So learn to smile.
Kiss your tears goodbye.

She was a little ghetto child.
And then she turned her life around.
Another day.
And I gotta find another way.
Baby don't you cry.
Dry your eyes.
You can spread your wings and learn to fly - high, high…...

Baby dry your eyes.
You can spread your wing and learn to fly - high, so high…...
Baby don't you cry.
You can spread your wings and learn to fly - high, high…...

Baby dry your eyes.
You can spread your wings and learn to fly - high, so high……

Said she gotta get outta the ghetto, oh yes…...
