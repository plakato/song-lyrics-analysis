First World Problem Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


When I woke.
I found my phone in the bed clothes.
And the curtain glowed crimson through the window.
To think of her was to want her.
Would you want me too?

You've got it all and yet.
You're betting all you have on a first world problem.
You've got to understand.
That I could be your man or a first world problem.

I know that I was better as a loser.
She's eating birthday cake inside the disco.
I may be lost but I'm a lost man.
In love with you.

You've got it all and yet.
You're betting all you have on a first world problem.
You've got to understand.
That I could be your man or a first world problem.

You've got it all and yet.
You're betting all you have on a first world problem.
First world problem.
First world problem.
First world problem.
