Copafield Lyrics
by 404WILL.

404, aye, aye.

I be in the field then disappear like Copafield.
Nigga posing with the strap I know he not foreal.

Aye, me and my niggas on the map bitch that's my gang.
And my chain be swangin, johnny Dang-ing.
Lanes i'm changing, I'm in a foreign, you in a 4 door.
Finna be touring, can't get out your door, aye.
All i want is peace and quiet, imma start a riot.
All bullshit aside, coldest nigga alive, aye.
Beamer blue like a blue jay, going up like a tuesday.
Karate chop like bruce say, never pressed for no pus-say.
Codeine in my kool-aid, , uh.
K-Preme got a click-clack, i'm recording nigga get back.
Water whip where my wrist at, my name where your list at.
My gang where your bitch at, aye, my gang with your bitch.
Told ya lil bitch it's my season,.
Your hoe on her knees yeah she pleasing, going this hard for.
No reason, I play and get tired, then i'm leaving.
Lean got her sucking me while i'm sleeping.

Okay Long Live A$ap Yams, NAZ that's my fam, boy.
We ain't heard of him, so we finna murder him, we pull.
The curtains in,  If i don't know him.
I ain't serving him,  my Ksubis all blanco.
True story, James Franco, 10 chains, nigga Django, playa nigga.
Need a kangol, smoking fruity nigga mango, set a trend when i change.
Clothes, me and my niggas run trains on ya main hoe, ya main hoe, main hoe.

I be in the field then disappear like Copafield.
Nigga posing with the strap I know he not foreal, I know he not foreal.

Aye, aye, aye, aye.
We be in the field then disappear like Copafield.
Nigga possin with the strap we know he not foreal.
We know he not foreal, the way I'm piped up in your bitch you'd think I.
Popped a pill, NAZ, Bitch, aye, aye, aye.
Good Cartier on my frames, and my jeans they say helmet lane.
In the booth nigga going insane!
Good wood grain and i'm... and i'm gone, and i'm gone.
Leave me lone, don't hit my phone, aye.
