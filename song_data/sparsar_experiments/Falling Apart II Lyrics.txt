Falling Apart II Lyrics
by Xilent.

Feel the warmth of the rays of light that shine upon you.
Feel your heart while the world feels like it's falling apart.
Take my hand while the whole wide world it feels like drowning.
Need you now.
Don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.
Feel the warmth of the rays of light that shine upon you.
Feel your heart while the world feels like it's falling apart.
Take my hand while the whole wide world it feels like drowning.
Need you now.
Don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.
