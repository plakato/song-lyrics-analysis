It's Tricky Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..


This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital.
To rock , that's right.
It's Tricky is the title, here we go....

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time.
It's Tricky...it's Tricky  Tricky.
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time.
It's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tricky  Trrrrrrrrrrricky.

I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly.
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early.
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me.
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said It's not that easy.

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time.
It's Tricky... It's Tricky  Tricky.
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time.
It's Tricky...Tricky  Tricky.

In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme.
They really  but we just  because we have no time.
And in the city it's a pity cause we just can't hide.
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside.

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time.
It's Tricky... Tricky  Tricky.
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time.
It's Tricky...Tricky  Tricky  huh!

When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time.
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cause I make up a rhyme.
I'm not braggin', people naggin' cause they think I'm a star.
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far.

A girl named Carol follows Daryll every gig we play.
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay.
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cause I'm on TV.
They even bother my poor father cause he's down with me.

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time.
It's Tricky... Tricky  Tricky.
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time.
It's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky  Tr-tr-tr....

We are not thugs  but you assume.
They offer coke  but we just leave it alone.
It's like that y'all , but we don't quit.
You keep on  shock! cause this is it....
