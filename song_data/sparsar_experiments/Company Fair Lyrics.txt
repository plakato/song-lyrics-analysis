Company Fair Lyrics
by World's Fair.


Pick up your piece G 
I'm representin' for Queens, 
Where, niggas, quick to fuck your bitch 
And live luxurious dreams. 
I'M From the East, see 
So. You should know what I mean 
NY'til. I die 
World's spit as a team. 
Ain'T, nothing PG, 
NC-17, 
7 seas, flow 
Wetter, gettin', better, it seems 
Nigga if need be, 
I'll. Take it up to the bean 
Hit up Salim 
Tell him bring the white bitches to me. 
 
With, my language most think. I'M from another planet, 
So many fake, niggas wouldn't ever understand it. 
I'M left like the hand I shake their hand with quick 
Cause, I'm back on the job like I missed a check, 
Called out, 
I'm sick still, let all my spill 
And. Then I take the paper. 
Get fresh for later 
Big city of dreams, 
Levitating Queens with me 

Point to where I live, 
Lansky Remy Banks, Nasty, 
Cotton, 
And, that's a hundred percent 
You must pick it 
Years we put in 
Blood, sweat, tears, 
Work live slaves, we some upset niggas 
The best under the Moon 
Accept all challenges: 
With 3 Kings, stay 
Christmas, Jewish holidays, 
No days off 
And, that's on all calendars! 
Givin' you! My twist till I pop like silencers, 
 
Queens, get the money 
I'm yellin', that to the grave 
Coffin full of gold chains 
Yet. I refuse to be enslaved: 
By these corporate label, niggas 
Stealing creativity, 
Blocking, all the shine 
Like skyscrapers in the city 
Fuck that 
We'll continue rhyming, independently 
World's, Fair 
The, next Queens artists to make history. 
Killing small talk with giant lyrics like Sasquatch 
Your time's up 
 
Queens historian, 
Born Coronian, 
Roof, Victorian, 
Rhymes, DeLorean, 
World's, Fair podium, 
Ten minute, walk from tomorrow, 
Fifteen minute ride to Corado 
All black Marauder 
VER bomber, 
Electric, politic 
Green and orange brim. Rocker 
Budweis lager 
Meadow park. Jogger 
Order Cherry Valley, 
Give me two Godfathers: 
 
Off, the top rope 
Who's comin' now SAMO 
Super fly Snuka 
Your, favourite gun, delaro 
Shootin' out arrows 
And starin', down barrels, 
I'm bad to the bone; 
Even worse to the marrow 
Call me pro-Method Man. 
Codeine. Beware: 
I'm gone from my Vans 
To the roots of my hair, 
Sippin' purp, chasing green
 
But, I'm proud to be black. 
I still run the four fat 
Putting Queens on my back 
 
Who's that peeping through my window, 
POW 
CH-CH-BLAOW 
Ain't. Nobody now 
Child you'll lose your balance, trying to figure out my angle, 
Gamble with a World's Fair vandal and get mangled 
Linger in the city. With that middle finger, dangled 
The, live, shows and movies, 
Cop tickets on Fandango, 
I'll, manhandle, 
You thinking you, we a sham, no 
It's more like a Shamwow 
Absorbing, the fans now
