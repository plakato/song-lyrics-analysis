100s and 50s Lyrics
by Que.


No ones: no fives; no tens, no twenties, 
Just hundreds and fifties hundreds and fifties 
Hundreds and fifties hundreds and fifties 
X2, 
No ones; no fives; no, tens, no twenties, 
Just, hundreds and fifties They coming in crispy, 
X2, 
No ones; no fives; no, tens, no twenties, 
Just, hundreds And fifties: 
X2 
 
I never put pussy on a pedestal. 
Always smoke good that medical 
Chopping up a nigga like Hannibal 
Turn, a fault nigga to a vegetable 
Young QUE ridding in the ghotti 
DUI drinking lean. 
Big ass gun make a fault, nigga run 
Like Kanye do when he see the paparazzi 
50's and Hunneds Hunneds and 50's 
They coming in, and they coming in crispy 
We, not trusting these bitches just fucking these bitches 
We ducking. We do em like Frisbee 
Pull up in fiskers, my diamonds look crispy 
My whip got me squeezed in. I know you can digg it 
They chop em like hersheys, then blow you some kisses, 
50 extensions. They know when you're missing 
What. You do nigga 
Well designer by my 
5's and 10's bitch. We hate tho, 
Ain't, no 1's in my bankroll 
 
Come at me, crazy! I'M taking you here, 
Kick it with yeah, I'm baking the bread 
Sequel to sequel, just stay with the man 
100's and 50's 
Riding shoe box, rich nigga, quick to get booba 
Popped in his goochie, his gooa 
Icy, as coolax bitch, trying to play with my moolah 
Comming Up shorter than coolax
