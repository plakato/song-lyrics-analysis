The Refractory Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

Any ground will do to bury.
One the earth does not anticipate.
Drinking in the spirit wide shouldered.
Wide mouth perfect mason.
The no good thing in me.
The seller of the Sun.
The cast douve mosabe.
The lawless one.
The shakers a shamble.

A standing fire ever doth intercede.
Rip the roof off and lower me down.
Forever in my time of need.

Son of the foaming see.
Her kiss just three days away.
From me.
Nevertheless.

We are not His witness.
Nevertheless.
This thing I have known.
He likes it cedar wood made.
Sealed with pitch.
The many rooms inside.
Come on soothsayer.
One ball remains.
He sees red six He has hated.
Yeah even seven.
Lying in wait.
In the shadow dim lit.
Ascended on high.
Taking captivity captive my audience.
Do you hear what I hear?
Way up in the sky, little lamb?
I stand corrected.
The refractory may rest.
In the shadow dim lit.
We remember one bull remains.
Way up in the sky little lamb.
You even seven.

Forever my time of need come.
