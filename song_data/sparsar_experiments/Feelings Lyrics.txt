Feelings Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


I sit and wonder at the TV screen.
And wonder what does it mean.
Is it all an illusion.
All the while it makes me smile.
Put it in another file.
Is it all an evolution.

Would you like to go and entertain these feelings.
I would really like to know.
Would you like to go and entertain these feelings.
I would really like to know.

Another day another girl.
Looking to unrule the world.
Looking for a solution.
All the while it makes me smile.
Put it in another file.
Is it all an evolution.

Feelings that make me sad.
Feelings that make me feel so glad.
Feelings that make me think.
Of the best time I ever had.

1, 2, 3, 4, yeah.

Feelings x6.
