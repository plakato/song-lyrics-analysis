30 Round Clip Lyrics
by Black Kray.


I'm growin up around' ya know.
All these older guy's, older than me.
And I see them doin' it, ya know.
So I think it's cool, so you know.
My momma ya know she wasn't able to give me everything I wanted, ya know.
Far as clothing wise, and ya know tennis shoe's wise.
So I saw them out there gettin' it, So you know.
They put it in my head, like you know, I could get it too.
You know that fast money.
I can't not be talkin' about it, but, you know.

Went from smoking blunt's ya know what I'm sayin...

Cell phones, Boost mobiles, got me turnt up.
Candy paint, blowin' candy dank, swisher's aren't the same.
Drip low, money dead low, that's why I smoke.
Skin tone, foreign redbones, foreign mac's too.
Shoot a nigga's bitch through the back here.
I'm so positive, I'll rob your hoe and go and cash out.
Drop a couple one's on her titties then I peel out.
Rob a shawty, got a young nigga steezed out.
Gave me hella jewels, got me feelin' real like Jesus.
Make her roll the weed up, smokin' amnesia.
Bitch I'm slugged up, call me gold mouth princess.
Smiling with the TEC, gave me neck in the igloo.
Iced out igloo...

I'm growin up around' ya know.
All these older guy's, older than me.
And I see them doin' it, ya know.
So I think it's cool, so you know.
My momma ya know she wasn't able to give me everything I wanted, ya know.
Far as clothing wise, and ya know tennis shoe's wise.
So I saw them out there gettin' it, So you know.
They put it in my head, like you know, I could get it too.
You know that fast money.
I can't not be talkin' about it, but, you know.

Went from smoking blunt's ya know what I'm sayin'.
