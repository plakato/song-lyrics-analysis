Don't Fuck Around Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


Fuck 'round, get stuck in the ground like a golfball.
You stay asleep with your eyes open, you Ray Charles.
Rub me the wrong way, get burned like the iron on.
Your girl a major meat-eater so we call her dinosaur.
My life a movie so I fuck with the camera on.
They say I'm a Don, so call me Corleone.
Mind on the money, so that's all you see in my phone.
Custo's, bitches and hoes, my main ho be hatin' Dough.
Probably cause she slidin' on me like I don't know.
But you know the code, M.O.B., get you cause I'mma get me.
Born and raised in these city streets, Obama couldn't change me.
?

He fucked around, he fucked around, he fucked around.
Get stuck in the ground.
He fucked around, he fucked around.
Get stuck in the ground.
So don't fuck around, don't fuck around, don't fuck around.
Don't fuck around, don't fuck around.
Get stuck in the ground.

Ride on 'em, slide on 'em, all my niggas goin' to ride, homie.
Blackland my side, homie, wintertime, got the five on me.
Hit 'em up, I ain't even know 'em.
Couldn't tell 'em show I had to show 'em.
Ski mask, that toe tag, that tech-nine, you touch mine.
Gold teeth spit gold rhymes, spit dope, spit cold lines.
Feel me, a real G, been hood, I been me.
Guns up, you know what's up, hood niggas in army trucks.
Big boots we stomp, bruh, get buck, we turnin' up.

He fucked around, he fucked around, he fucked around.
Get stuck in the ground.
He fucked around, he fucked around.
Get stuck in the ground.
So don't fuck around, don't fuck around, don't fuck around.
Don't fuck around, don't fuck around.
Get stuck in the ground.

You don't want war with us, dreads swing, I'm a warrior.
Bitch nigga keep actin' up, my young goons goin' to pack him up.
Put him up then strap him up, callin' shots they handle ya.
Got the tools, dismantle ya, he fucked around, I ain't mad at ya.
That Glock spit is goin' to rip, your body, your chest flip.
I'm from the city where niggas gritty, do me, get every penny.
Fuck hoes, I got plenty, none of them get shit from me.
She fucked, she get in front me, soft niggas get flipped, homie.
Took her home, she kissed on me, call her when I get lonely.
But I never get lonely, cause I been a mack, homie.
Ask me what I did, homie, pull her with two twins, homie.
The one and the only, shootin' fools like I'm Kobe.

He fucked around, he fucked around, he fucked around.
Get stuck in the ground.
He fucked around, he fucked around.
Get stuck in the ground.
So don't fuck around, don't fuck around, don't fuck around.
Don't fuck around, don't fuck around.
Get stuck in the ground.
