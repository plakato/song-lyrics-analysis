Bands (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Quilly.

Remind me of Bruce Jenner Just A bitch in Disguise.
Next Day 20k bussin out My Linen.
I get a baldy kill you let my hair grow.
I ain't know how to pitch I made myself tall.
Im gettin paid for the walkthrough.
I ain't got this Glock for nothin Nigga I Send dem.
Put it in the pot call it synchronizing swimming.
They ain't even touch pastries Im sicker than lies.
Niggas think they fuckin wit Quilly it ain't there though.
If I get the drop you get sent to the sky.
I used to want lo but i settled for lacoste.
Fake trap niggas talkin bout flippin dem pies.
I stand in the Field by myself like A Scarecrow.
Now I send niggas Outta town bring me triple back.
I carry tools like a handyman, Spin ya block with all my cousins in a family.
Coke so good you get high from the cook up.
I gotcha bitch at the loft slidin dick up her thighs.
I make a smoker wipe my wheel off, give em advice a .20 piece then i Peel off.
My niggas smokin on Ivory like How High.
These niggas you think thurl they all weirdos.
Fish Scale on the Block we Goin Fishing.
I used to fronted stack packs bringin nickel packs.
Yea! I made myself a boss.
My face on the bus see me every time you look up.


Nigga we can go to war like Afghanistan.
These bitches givin up the puss They shoulda listened to Piles.
van.
All these bad Bitches get curved after i bend dem.
Quilly Eatin good no more PB&amp;J'S.
Them labels knockin on my door cuz they Seee the Wave.
Read between the lines nigga scared to pick a book up.
Nigga you Rue Paul I can see the bitch in ya eyes.
I told this bitch jump she said  how high ?
Ain't nothin on it though the work skinny-dippin.
Doctor give me lean, I make myself cough.

I send niggas in ya crib Xfinity Live.
Just left Phlipe's and i Knocked my whole Meal off.
If I'on owe my publishing I cut the whole deal off.
Ciroc lifestyle but I came from Amsterdam.
My shooter gettin paid for the drive by.
