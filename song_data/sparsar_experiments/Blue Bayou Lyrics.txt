Blue Bayou Lyrics
by Swiss (DE).


I feel so bad I've gotta worried mind.
I'm so lonesome all the time.
Since I've left my baby behind on Blue Bayou.
Saving nickels, saving dimes, working till the sun dont shine.
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou.

I'm going back someday, come with me on Blue Bayou.
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou.
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloats, if I could only see.
That familiar sunrise from sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be.

Gonna see my baby again.
Gonna be with some of my friends.
Maybe I'll be better again on Blue Bayou.
Saving nickels, saving dimes, working till the sun dont shine.
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou.

I'm going back someday, come with me on Blue Bayou.
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou.
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloats, if I could only see.
That familiar sunrise from sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be.

I wanna be back with me lady, back with me one.
Back with me woman, oh back with me love.
Hold her close suffocate her, anything she wants I'll cater.
And I'll promise to never leave her side.
While she vows to be my wife.
Thats why, I can't wantt to get back to my lady.

I'm going back someday, come with me on Blue Bayou.
Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine on Blue Bayou.
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat if I could only see.
That familiar sunrise from sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be.

Kou ofa lahi atu kiho mata.
