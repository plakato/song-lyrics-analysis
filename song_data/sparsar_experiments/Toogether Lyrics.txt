Toogether Lyrics

Song by Sponny Bee 
, 
Eyo ..., Just diverted from my path, 
To think about .... My life choices, ... 
 
Thought. It was heaven 
But, never got chance in 11. 
My friends are all gone. Even the folks from 7 
There are limits. Even social media can't reach 
Now. I realize I got to study 
Cause life's a bitch 
Now. I look back to my'bright as sunshine' days. 
The life full of S's and A's 
I'm, a lucky guy got nice parents 
I don't need my teachers 
To hell with them. 
This life's just messed up, 
You hold hands with one 
The Brief History of Time. 
But, I'm not Stephen 
I. Thank all of you for being a part of me. 
I'Ll! Never forget you, Don't you dare think 
This CPU's getting old, but my brain ain't 
I may be somewhere else. Perseverance 
I got my dreams guys you got yours, 
We love our batch, even if Worlds apart, 
 
And. I think that we won't be together. 
But. Inside of me, it tickles 
Like. My conscience wants to join the discussion. 
 
I, never hated rock 
It just made my ears burst. 
Just, like a thousand, and one of my ex-girlfriends 
Guitar in background. 
This is a different me 
Open, the book. This is a new story. 
The new me, ..., 
 
I think nobody should be. Let go 
Let go ..., 
But life just pulls them away. 
You just can't go with the flow 
Can. You control all the emotions. 
You got trapped inside that frame. 
I know ... 
I know how it feels to be torn inside 
 
And. I think that we wouldn't be together. 
Together ... 
But. My conscience says else: ... 
I'll just leave it to a luck matter. 
 
Life fucks us surprises, 
We, don't understand, 
We can't read it can't comprehend 
We on our own in this game. Our ways 
Like me on this mic till the end of time. 
 
I think that we will be together forever 
But. It just doesn't matter what I do, what I say: ... 
 
I, just don't care ...,
