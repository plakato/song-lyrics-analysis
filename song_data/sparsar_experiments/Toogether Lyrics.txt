Toogether Lyrics
by Wonderstarz.

Song by Sponny Bee.

Eyo... Just diverted from my path.
To think about... My life choices....

Thought it was heaven.
But never got chance in 11.
My friends are all gone - even the folks from 7.
There are limits even social media can't reach.
Now I realize I got to study.
Cause life's a bitch.
Now I look back to my 'bright as sunshine' days -.
The life full of S's and A's.
I'm a lucky guy - got nice parents.
I don't need my teachers -.
To hell with them.
This life's just messed up.
You hold hands with one.
The Brief History of Time -.
But I'm not Stephen.
I thank all of you for being a part of me.
I'll never forget you - Don't you dare think.
This CPU's getting old but my brain ain't.
I may be somewhere else - Perseverance.
I got my dreams, guys - you got yours.
We love our batch - even if Worlds apart.

And I think that we won't be together.
But inside of me it tickles -.
Like my conscience wants to join the discussion.

I never hated rock.
It just made my ears burst.
Just like a thousand and one of my ex-girlfriends.
Guitar in background.
This is a different me.
Open the book - this is a new story.
The new me....

I think nobody should be let go.
Let go....
But life just pulls them away.
You just can't go with the flow.
Can you control all the emotions.
You got trapped inside that frame.
I know....
I know how it feels to be torn inside.

And I think that we wouldn't be together.
Together....
But my conscience says else....
I'll just leave it to a luck matter.

Life fucks us - surprises.
We don't understand.
We can't read it - can't comprehend.
We on our own in this game, our ways.
Like me on this mic till the end of time.

I think that we will be together, forever.
But it just doesn't matter what I do, what I say....

I just don't care....
