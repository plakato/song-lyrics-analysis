Wile Out Lyrics
by Zinc.

You don't want to play with dynamite.
The shit that blow your world apart.
Somewhere you can come but please don't try.
Cause a single blast'll break straight through your heart.

I ain't never see you no ready.
Long as she don't sound so deadly.
Seems they never knew the things we do.
But we just stop, ready to rock.
We drive a box and we get down, down.

If he mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out.
If he vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out.
If he out, wile out, right or not, girl stop, wile out.
Gwarn get deep make a scene wile out.
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him.

If he mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out.
If he vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out.
If he out, wile out, right or not, girl stop, wile out.
Gwarn get deep make a scene wile out.
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him.

Don't you take me there, you don't wanna know.
Where this crazy cool is about to go.
Don't you take me there, you don't wanna see.
What this crazy cool is about to be.

If he mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out.
If he vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out.
If he out, wile out, right or not, girl stop, wile out.
Gwarn get deep make a scene wile out.
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him.

If he mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out.
If he vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out.
If he out, wile out, right or not, girl stop, wile out.
Gwarn get deep make a scene wile out.
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him.

Don't you take me there, you don't wanna know.
Where this crazy cool is about to go.
Don't you take me there, you don't wanna see.
What this crazy cool is about to be.

Don't you take me there, you don't wanna know.
Where this crazy cool is about to go.
Don't you take me there, you don't wanna see.
What this crazy cool is about to be.

If he mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out.
If he vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out.
If he out, wile out, right or not, girl stop, wile out.
Gwarn get deep make a scene wile out.
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him.

If he mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out.
If he vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out.
If he out, wile out, right or not, girl stop, wile out.
