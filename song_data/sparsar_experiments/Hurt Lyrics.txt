Hurt Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Suicideyear Sad Boys, 
 
Shawty Ima, do things that you ain't never did 
Finna wake up. Next to you in my crib cause 
I'ma make you hurt 
I'ma I'ma make you hurt 
 
Sad Boys we on deck 
Am I awake. I got to check 
Went to sleep. Then I came back 
I'm the same guy smoking loud pack, 
Iced out right back, PCP attack, 
Greedy pills, hoes on my ball sack 
They, don't know how to act. 
High tech watch, high tech, locked 
Broken skies, fantastic fox, 
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock 
Emotion boys. We in the UFO 
Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy 
In Tokyo playing Mario 
Sad Boys blast your stereos 
Sucking on my nuts, like pistachios 
Mixing champagne, with Carpaccio 
Slangin, dough Ho, I'm in that polo
 
Stacks of money. More for you 
Milkshakes, with the crushed up oreos 
I'm. In Italy, Rodeo 
Forgive me after my death, Caravaggio
 
Louis duffel bag filled with heroin 
Louis goons, who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let them in 
Louis duffel bag filled with heroin 
Louis goons, who finna trip on LSD acid tabs. Let them in 
 
Shawty Ima. Do things that you ain't never did 
Finna wake up next to you in my crib cause 
I'ma make you hurt 
I'ma I'ma make you hurt 
 
Bitch. I light up the sky. Call me Charmeleon 
My life's on the line. 
I ain't Charmander, but I'm nearly on 
clearly on drugs 
That will make you hear clearly wrong. 
Longer than my yearly bong hit 
Shawty thinks she's guest star Lean, 
Lean, Doer dresses, slicker 
I'm, so iced out that it's Winter 
Destroy, my stupid, liver 
I, be on that bape shit. You rocking Quicksilver 
Never hesitate shit to pull the trigger 
Luxurious ate before my dinner. Throw Bombay down the river 
Yea, you get that picture 
Gold and silver around my finger. 
Shorty on that West Side. She a gold digger, wake up 
And, I'm a winner, showering in five star 
Ho. Take that look in the mirror, I'm
on my grind 
Like, all the time. Bitch, I'm Murakami
 
Shawty, sucking on my pastrami, Get that salami 
 
Shawty Ima. Do things that you ain't never did 
Finna wake up next to you in my crib cause 
I'ma make you hurt 
I'ma I'ma make you hurt, 
 
Louis duffel bag filled with heroin 
Louis Louis Louis duffel bag filled with heroin 
Louis Louis Louis duffel bag filled with heroin. 
Sad Boys
