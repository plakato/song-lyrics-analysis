Hurt Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Suicideyear, Sad Boys.

Shawty Ima do things that you ain't never did.
Finna wake up next to you, in my crib, cause.
I'ma make you hurt.
I'ma I'ma make you hurt.

Sad Boys, we on deck.
Am I awake?, I got to check.
Went to sleep, then I came back.
I'm the same guy smoking loud pack.
Iced out, right back, PCP attack.
Greedy pills hoes, on my ball sack.
They don't know how to act.
High tech watch, high tech locked.
Broken skies, fantastic fox.
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock.
Emotion boys we in the UFO.
Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy.
In Tokyo, playing Mario.
Sad Boys blast your stereos.
Sucking on my nuts like pistachios.
Mixing champagne with Carpaccio.
Slangin dough, Ho I'm in that polo.

Stacks of money, more for you.
Milkshakes with the crushed up oreos.
I'm in Italy, Rodeo.
Forgive me after my death, Caravaggio.

Louis duffel bag filled with heroin.
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let them in.
Louis duffel bag filled with heroin.
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let them in.

Shawty Ima do things that you ain't never did.
Finna wake up next to you, in my crib, cause.
I'ma make you hurt.
I'ma I'ma make you hurt.

Bitch I light up the sky, call me Charmeleon.
My life's on the line.
I ain't Charmander, but I'm nearly on,.
clearly on drugs.
That will make you hear clearly wrong.
Longer than my yearly bong hit.
Shawty thinks she's guest star Lean.
Lean Doer dresses slicker.
I'm so iced out that it's Winter.
Destroy my stupid liver.
I be on that bape shit, you rocking Quicksilver.
Never hesitate, shit, to pull the trigger.
Luxurious, ate before my dinner, throw Bombay down the river.
Yea, you get that picture.
Gold and silver around my finger.
Shorty on that West Side, she a gold digger, wake up.
And I'm a winner, showering in five star.
Ho take that look in the mirror, I'm.
on my grind.
Like all the time, Bitch I'm Murakami.

Shawty sucking on my pastrami, Get that salami.

Shawty Ima do things that you ain't never did.
Finna wake up next to you, in my crib, cause.
I'ma make you hurt.
I'ma I'ma make you hurt.

Louis duffel bag filled with heroin.
Louis Louis Louis duffel bag filled with heroin.
Louis Louis Louis duffel bag filled with heroin.
Sad Boys.
