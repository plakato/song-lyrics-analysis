Work Out Lyrics
by Sweet Tee.

computerized voice.
Work it out.
You got to work it, come on.
Work it out.
Shake your body till you break it.
You got to work it out.

female voice.
Work out.
Everybody work out.
Think it's a party, work out.
Everybody work out.
Think it's a party, work.

Work.

Jump on this beat.
Pump it up, rock with Sweet Tee.
It's time to jam, so get out of your seat.
Come on, get on up, get down to the sounds.
Droppin pound by pound.
Shakin and breakin and movin and groovin it all around.
That's what it's all about, there's no doubt.
Let's work it out, turn it out, burn it out.
Now.
Move it.

female voice.
Work out.
Everybody work out.
Think it's party work out.

This is a jam man.
Not a grandstand.
I wanna see some butts shakin, backs breakin.
Feet skippin and hips dippin.
I demand you to dance.
There's no wallflower-power.
This hour, work out now, or.

W-w-work.

Work it out.

It's a party damn it.
Put your body in it.
Let the lyrics move you.
And our music groove you.
People come alive.
Shift into overdrive.
It's a dancin record.
Do what's expected.

Sweet Tee's in effect, what the heck.
I want cash, not a check.
If I'm correct you can bet.
You ain't heard nothin yet.
Work it out hard, cause it's hot, so just sweat it.
Yo, I ain't takin no shorts, so forget it.
Hear the music drop.
Let your body rock non-stop.
Pump it up, let's go if it feels good ya don't stop.
Now that you know.
Then let's party, let's go.
And work it out, yeah.
You gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta.

Work out.
Everybody work out.
Think it's a party, work out.

Now I think you got it.
Jettin like a rocket.
Wasn't hard, now was it?
Everybody does it.
From New York with respect.
Work out's in full effect.
My mission is complete.
Gave you a dope beat.

computerized voice.
Work it out, you got to work it.
Shake your body till you break it.

Work it out, you got to work it.
Shake your body till you break it.
You got to work it out.
Work it out.
You got to work it out.
Work it out.
You got to work it out.

Just work it out.
Just work it out.
