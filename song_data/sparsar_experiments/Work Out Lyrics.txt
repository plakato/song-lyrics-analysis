Work Out Lyrics
by Sweet Tee.

Computerized voice 
Work it out 
You, got to work. It come on 
Work it out. 
Shake your body till you break it. 
You got to work it out. 
 
female, voice, 
Work out, 
Everybody work out 
Think. It'S a party work out, 
Everybody work out 
Think. It'S a party work, 
, 
Work, 
 
Jump on this beat 
Pump it up rock with Sweet, Tee 
It's time to jam so get out of your seat. 
Come on get on up, get down to the sounds: 
Droppin pound by pound, 
Shakin and breakin, and movin and groovin. It all around 
That's what it's all about, there's no doubt 
Let's work it out turn it out burn it out: 
Now 
Move, it 
 
female, voice, 
Work out 
Everybody work out 
Think, it's party work out. 
 
This is a jam. Man 
Not a grandstand 
I wan na see some butts, shakin backs breakin, 
Feet, skippin and hips dippin 
I demand you to dance 
There's, no wallflower-power 
This hour work out now or 
 
W-w-work 
 
Work it out 
 
It's a party damn it 
Put your body in it. 
Let, the lyrics move, you 
And our music groove. You 
People come alive, 
Shift into overdrive, 
It's, a dancin record 
Do. What'S expected, 
 
Sweet Tee's. In effect, what the heck 
I want cash, not a check. 
If, I'm correct! You can bet 
You ain't heard nothin, yet 
Work. It out hard cause, it's hot, so just sweat. It 
Yo. I ain't takin, no shorts, so forget it. 
Hear the music drop 
Let, your body rock non-stop 
Pump it up. Let'S go if it feels good ya. Don'T stop 
Now that you know 
Then, let's party, let's go 
And work it out. Yeah 
You got ta, got ta got ta got ta 
 
Work out 
Everybody work out 
Think. It'S a party work out, 
 
Now! I think you got it. 
Jettin, like a rocket 
Wasn't hard now was it 
Everybody? Does it 
From New York with respect 
Work out's in full effect? 
My mission is complete. 
Gave you, a dope, beat 
 
computerized voice. 
Work it out. You got to work, it 
Shake, your body till you break it. 
 
Work it out, you got to work, it 
Shake, your body till you break it. 
You got to work it out. 
Work it out. 
You got to work it out. 
Work it out. 
You got to work it out. 
 
Just work it out; 
Just work it out.
