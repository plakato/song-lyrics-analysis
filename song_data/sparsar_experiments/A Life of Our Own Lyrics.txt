A Life of Our Own Lyrics
by The Undead.

We were raised by a computer.
We never had no mom or dad.
And the rest of our life story.
Is surely just as sad.
Abandoned by the ones we loved.
In a world we couldn't understand.
We never had no reasons.
So we never made no plans.
And now we're speeding down.
Life's highway.
In white vinyl and chrome.
But someday we're gonna live.
A life of our own.
We always got in trouble with the teachers in our schools.
We never respected nothing, never followed any rules.
Outcasts at an early age, the first kids on the moon.
I guess we found out a little too late, we grew up a little to soon.

And now I guess we can't buy.
A split level home.
But someday we're gonna live.
A life of our own.
A life of our own.
Now we're speeding down.
Life's highways.
In white vinyl and chrome.
But we're never gonna live.
A life of our own.
We always got in trouble with the teachers in our schools.
We never respected nothing, never followed any rules.
Outcasts at an early age, the first kids on the moon.
I guess we found out a little too late, we grew up a little to soon.

And now I guess we can't buy.
A split level home.
But someday we're gonna live.
A life of our own.
A life of our own.
Now we're speeding down.
Life's highways.
In white vinyl and chrome.
But we're never gonna live.
A life of our own.
A life of our own.
A life of our own.
A life of our own.
A life of our own.
