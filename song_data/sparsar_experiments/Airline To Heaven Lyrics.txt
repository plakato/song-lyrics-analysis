Airline To Heaven Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

There'S an airline plane 
Flies to heaven every day, 
Past them pearly gates. 
If. You want to ride this train 
Have your ticket in your hand, 
Before it is too late. 
If the world looks wrong. 
And your money's spent and gone 
And. Your friend has turned away. 
You can get away to heaven 
On this aeroplane 
Just bow your head and pray. 
 
Them's got ears. Let them hear 
Them's got eyes. Let them see 
Turn your eyes to the lord of the skies 
Take that airline plane 
It will take you home again. 
Yes. Take you home again 
Yes to your home beyond the skies, 
 
Well, a lot of people, guess 
Some, say no and some say yes 
Will it take some and leave some behind 
But. You will surely know 
When to the airport. Go 
To leave this world behind 
 
Oh. A lot of speakers speak 
And, a lot of preachers preach. 
When. You lay their salary on the line 
But to bow your head and pray 
Is the only earthly way 
That you can fly to heaven on time. 
That. You can reach heaven on time: 
 
Your ticket you obtain 
On, this heavenly airline plane 
You leave your sins behind 
You have got to take this flight. 
Might be daytime, might be night 
But. You can't see your way if you're blind,
