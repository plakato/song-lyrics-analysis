Honeysuckle Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

You have tried.
You are ripped up.
But nothing has changed.

They have told you.
You will be lucky..
But nothing has changed.

I can't wait to set it off.
And it will be the end finally.

I'm gonna lie back down.
And ask for nothing, nothing.
I'm gonna throw it back, and.
Let it, let it go.

Though I'm not concerned;.
For this how it goes.
I am ill.
But it does not hurt.

I get up, get up.
But my day is ruined again.
I get up, get up.
But the day is ruined again.

You can run.
But what's the point?
They won't catch you.
You can love.
But to what end?
They won't leave you.

I get up, get up.
But my day is ruined again.
I get up, get up.
But the day is ruined again.

Yesterday was awful;.
Today is discolored.
