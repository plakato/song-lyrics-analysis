Communication Letdown Lyrics
by United Nations.

No, you can't believe it's true.
They can't be pulling a fast one.
You count your blessings.
But it's never enough.
Never enough.
Now you're living life.
In the pass lane.
You've got your foot.
On the brakes.
You'll never take a risk.
Never again never again.

It's always the same.
Things fade.
But nothing ever changes.
Level the playing field.
But keep the pieces.
In relative motion.
I get it, I get it, I get it.

Its always the same.
These days.
We live in an ashtray.
Breathing Smoke.
No you can't put a facade.
Between yourself and the truth.
You've got to break it down.
Break it Down.
Break it Down.
We've been taking losses.
We should be taking offices.
We should be making promises.
We intend to keep.

It's always the same.
Things change.
But never when you need it.
You can show us.
The campaign.
But no one's ever watching.
Don't you get it?

It's always the same.
A lead rain.
But never on the front page.
A red stain.
But never on the hands.
Of the ones.
Who Pull the strings.
