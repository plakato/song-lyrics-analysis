Worried Lyrics
by 40 Cal.

DukeDaGod.
Let's get back to doin what we do man.
Harlem, we still in the building man, and ain't shit changed man.
Killa Season: The Movie in stores, April 25th.
Killa Season: The Album in stores, May 9th.
I go by the name of DukeDaGod.
Dis my other nigga from 40th.
Let these niggas know who you be.

40 Cal..
Who am I? 40 Cal. motherfucker.
Gat to your back, get down motherfucker.
Clown motherfucker.

Let me try to explain.
I shoot his truck up just to drive him insane.
Give his Rover the new name, the firing range.
When we see you yell fire and aim.
Cause when I fire them thangs it's like.

I gotta watch who wit me, watch who pretty.
Drop two-fitty on a hot new Bentley.
But when it come to drops say he cop too many like, damn.

Down with wonderful Cal. {they make Hummers in brown?}.
Nah I just shitted on you, even haters lovin my style.
I'm a role model, I make the hustlers proud.
I make the customers smile.

Catch me in them thangs with Jennifer, BM's with Olivia.
If it ain't Vivica or somebody sim-i-lar.
Comin down the block the suspense is killin ya like, wow.

That's Cal. we see him {we see him} we leavin {we leavin}.
He schemin, he be beastin.
Heard he kill people, we believe him.
Oh shit he's reachin.
