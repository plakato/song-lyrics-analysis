Let's get back to doin what we do. Man

Dis, my other nigga from 40th 
Let. These niggas know who you be 
 
40 Cal. 
Who. Am I 40 Cal. motherfucker 
Gat to your back, get down motherfucker 
Clown, motherfucker,

I shoot his truck up just to drive him insane 
Give his Rover, the new name, the firing range 
When. We see you yell fire and aim 
Cause. When I fire them thangs, it's like 
 
I got ta watch, who wit me watch who pretty 
Drop two-fitty on a hot new Bentley 
But when it come to drops, say he cop too many like damn 
 
Down with wonderful Cal. {. They make Hummers in brown. } 
Nah, I just shitted on you even haters lovin, my style 
I'm, a role model I make the hustlers proud 
I, make the customers smile, 
 
Catch me in them, thangs with Jennifer BM's with Olivia 
If, it ain't Vivica or somebody sim-i-lar 
Comin down the block. The suspense is killin ya, like wow
