Say It To Me Now Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Scratching at the surface now.
And I'm trying hard to work it out.
And so much has gone misunderstood.
And this mystery only leads to doubt.

And I didn't understand.
When you reached down to take my hand.
And if you have something to say.
You better say it now.

Cause this is what you've waited for.
A chance to even up the score.
And as these shadows fall on me now.
I will somehow, yeah.

Cause I'm picking up the message, Lord.
And I'm closer than I've ever been before.
So if you have something to say.
Say it to me now, just say it to me now, now.
Oh, oh, oh.
