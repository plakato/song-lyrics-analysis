All My Bitches Sip Mud Lyrics
by Yung nation.


I said all of my bitches sip mud.
And they know we be fuckin' each other..
I swear this bitch, she done fucked up..
Walked out my room, she was fuckin' my brother..
I said....
I said all of my bitches sip mud.
And they know we be fuckin' each other..
I swear this bitch done fucked up..
Walked outta my room, she was fuckin' my brother..
I said she was trippin' on them xannies..
Went through my phone, god dammit..
Saw my messages with lil' Tammie..
But this kush keep me off this planet.
So I Grabbed her bags  and threw it on the porch..
This bitch got me fucked up,  I ain't showin' no remorse..

It's 5:31 in the mornin'  but who gives a fuck..
It's time for her to pack her shit,  cause she done fucked up..
I'm paranoid, I'm trippin',  cause she xanned up and I'm flippin'.
And I'm geeked up I was sippin'.
And this shit really got me trippin'  so I.
Kicked her out my shit  before she had to call the law.
I kicked her out my shit,  through her ass against the wall..
Put the middle finger up, told her suck my balls..
Went to my contacts and blocked all her calls..

Two of my bitches on drugs,.
And they fuckin' with me to get a buzz..
I be bangin' that pussy for my bloods..
These hoes so bad they hold no grudge.
Dick in her mouth all she say is duh.
Paranoid, aggravated, don't fuss bitch I'm already frustrated.
Diamond earrings keep haters irritated, my foreign bitch go and translate it.
Blowin' on loud,  but I heard ya car deflated.
Straight shots at the bar,  but I ain't chasin' no.
