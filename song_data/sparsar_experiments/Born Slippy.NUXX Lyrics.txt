Born Slippy.NUXX Lyrics
by Underworld.

Drive boy, dog boy, dirty,.
numb angel boy.
In the doorway boy, she was a lipstick boy.
She was a beautiful boy and tears boy.
And all in your inner space boy.
You had chemicals boy and steel boy.
You had chemicals boy, I've grown so close to you.
Boy and you just groan boy.
She said, Come over, come over, she smiled at you boy x2.

Let your feelings lift, boy, but never your mask boy.
Random blonde boy, high density.
Random blonde boy, blonde country.
Blonde high density.

You are my drug boy, you're real boy.
Speak to me and boy, dog dirty numb cracking boy.
You get wet boy, big, big time boy, acid bear boy.
And babes and babes and babes and babes and babes.

And remembering nothing boy, when you like my tin horn boy.
And get wet like an angel, derail.

You got a velvet mouth, you're so succulent.
And beautiful shimmering and dirty wonderful.
And hot times on your telephone line.
You got to never land on your telephone and in walks an angel.

And look at me, your mum squatting pissed in a tube hole.
At Tottenham Court Road.
I just come out of The Ship.
Talking to the most blonde I ever met.

Shouting, Lager, lager, lager, lager.
Shouting, Lager, lager, lager, lager.
Shouting, Lager, lager, lager, lager.
Shouting, Lager, lager, lager.

Shouting Mega, mega white thing, mega, mega.
White thing, mega, mega white thing, mega, mega.
Shouting, Lager, lager, lager, lager.
Mega, mega white thing, mega, mega white thing.

So many things to see and do in the tube hole true blonde.
Going back to Romford, mega, mega, mega.
Going back to Romford, hi mum, are you having fun?
And now are you on your way to a new tension and headache?
