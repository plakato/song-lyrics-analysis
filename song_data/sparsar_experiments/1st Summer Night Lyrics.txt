1st Summer Night Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.

We here.
I pulled up with my friends.
We rollin' blunts again.
She pulled up with her friend.
She asked if they could get in.
I said but what you mean.
She said she got her own weed.
She don't beg for anythin'.
I said cool then come with me.
She saw my S13.
Then she dropped to her knees.
Then her eyes teared up.
I said what is this supposed to mean.

She said I love your car.
I admire it from a far.
I saw you ridin' in the city.
But did not know who you were.
Now we both up here together.
I'm going out on the limb.
Then she said Can we be friends?
I said Wait what? Come again.
She said Yeah, I know it's weird.
But I like the way this feels.
She said she can keep it real.
I said That's the only deal.
Then she pulled her S14.
With no SR she do JZ.
I saw her name on her seat.
She was the queen of Akagi.

Damn, I'm back in Fujiwara house.
Ain't nothin' to talk about.
You see us smokin' now.
While we sit in silence.
I let my window down.
To hear the engines out.
Around the city.
Cryin' secret languages.
And I'm still smokin' out 20 blunts.
In rotation.
It's only me and I'm fadin'.
I hate it I'm trynna' level out.
And I'm still thinkin' bout her.
I'm trynna' shake it.
But I can't seem to make it.
I think I'm tangled up.

I pulled up to my friends.
Just to clear my head and then.
We hear motors in the mount.
But we always park here.
I said What the fuck is this?
We pulled up so fuckin' quick.
Throwin' pounds on the clutch.
Nigga switchin' straight to fifth.
All I thought about was this.
When I get there Imma flip.
How the hell they pull op on Akina.
And trynna' rip.
Now we slide up to the end.
And I see her car and then.
Her's along with her friend.
She said she's glad I came again.
