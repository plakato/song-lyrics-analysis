Creation story essay Lyrics
by Ryan Anthony G..

In the genesis archetype god made every thing from heaves and earth to man and.
woman.And in Greek creation chaos was like there god. But there was more than.
one god in the Greek story rather than one in genesis. In genesis there were.
man and woman. That didn't know what good and evil was. But in Greek there.
were many and there was death and there was love. In Greek the child tried to.
over thorn the gods. In genesis the serpent was trying to make the woman eat.
the fruit that god said not to eat. But she did and because of that they saw.
that they were nude but they didn't know what was good and evil. Till that.
time so god kicked them out of the garden and gave them punishments.
