Marilyn Monroe Lyrics
by WreQ one.


You know who it is, I'm Back, yo.

I got a bad chick, &amp; she's shotgun.
We're Tom Cruisin' like Top Gun.
Let me put you on some game Boy.
Get another chick before you drop one.
Miss your shot, &amp; I'll get the re-bound.
I'm headed home, N-Y-C bound.
Foreign girls in my city.
Say they like the way that we sound.
I'm WreQ.one I'm reppin'.
Queens.
Flow Raw like them Nudie Jeans.
Tell LouieKid I'm in the Louis store.
Cause I got me them Louis Dreams.
Handbags, All Damier.
No tricking though, I'm not trying to pay;.
But if she want it more than money.
Then you know that she's gonna find a way.
Material Girl like Madonna.
She spend it like no ma·ña·na.
She checking out my checkbook.
She count the digits after that comma.
YOU FUCKBOYS, Can't lock her.
down.
She's too high, Can't knock her down.
Them agents trying to get in touch.
But for the real deal, You gotta shop around.
She front row at my next show.
With no clothes, She got the best pose.
She's a model type, &amp; She's looking right.
She doesn't need to follow a dress code.
We drink Rosé &amp; XO.
Best bet, We Gettin' done slow.
&amp; If you ask about that one, yo.
She's a bad chick, Marilyn Monroe..
