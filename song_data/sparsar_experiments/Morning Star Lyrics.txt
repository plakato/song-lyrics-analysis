Morning Star Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

I can see the end in sight as we pacify our itching ears.
Quickly we are trending light and absolving self of all eternal fears.
Until our conscious clears.
Hear this voice engage the fight as I pound my chest still knowing my end.
nears.
Still knowing my end nears.

The sun is burning out and your rule is left, your rule is left in doubt.
We'll sing, and scream, and shout For You have won, You have won the bout!

The earth is screaming against its bondage of decay.
Creation eager for the coming new day.
My lungs are breathing stealing every single breath.
Not my soul, but my body is put to death.

For if heaven's not your cry, you're still afraid to die.
I'll tell you now your end is not far.
The sun is burning out and with all creation shout.
Enter in the bright Morning Star.

I know this is a voyage, it's not my destination.
I know this is a voyage, it's not my destination.

Not waiting for no dying sun, or watching for a fading moon.
No shooting star has caught my eye.
Nothing in my hand.
Still there is nothing in my hand I bring.
Only to the cross.
For only to the cross my arms will cling.
Only to the cross.
Nothing in my hand that I will bring, there is nothing in my hand.

For if heaven's not your cry, you're still afraid to die.
I'll tell you now the end is not far.
The sun is burning out and with all creation shout.
Enter in the bright Morning Star.

I can see the coming light as the nights will pass and the dawn it clears.
Screaming out with all my might for the Morning Star, the Morning Star He.
nears.
I see a new day is coming.
I see a new day is near.
