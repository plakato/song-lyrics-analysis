Be Your Shadow Lyrics
by The Wombats.


Tonight we'll both go M.I.A.
In different towns but in similar ways.
I've tried my best, best to forget.
But I can't, I can't, I can't.

Tonight we'll scratch each other's face.
If it's in the moment no one complains.
I've tried my best to move along.
But I can't, I can't, I can't.

Kiss me with your fist it's alright.
Wrap your hands around my throat I won't mind.
I'm permanent, now I won't go.
I just want to be your shadow.

Just one more uptempo tune.
The suits don't care if their feet aren't blue.
Are you aware of whats going on.
In my heart, my heart, my heart.
Those machine gun eyes have fired crystals into me.
You're such a violent high.
And I'm such a loose cannon can't you see?

Kiss me with your fist it's all right.
Wrap your hands around my throat I won't mind.
I'm permanent, now I won't go.
I just wanna be your shadow.

Have a bus drive it over my rib cage.
Snap my bank cards and throw them at my face.
I'm permanent now I won't go.
I just want to be your shadow.

Breakdown.
And I just want to be sum of your broken parts.
And I just want to be your creature of the dark.
And I just want to be the sum of your broken parts.
And I just want to be your creature of, your creature of the dark.

I just want to be your shadow.

Kiss me with your fist it's alright.
Wrap your hands around my throat I won't mind.
I'm permanent, now I won't go.
I just want to be your shadow.

I just want to be your shadow.
I just want to be your shadow.
