What You Rep Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


What you rep nigga?
Gang banging throwing sets nigga.
Where you from? What you claim nigga?
Everybody with me gang, nigga.
Where you from nigga?
You better have yo gun with ya.
What you rep nigga?
We gang banging throwing sets nigga.

Riding round with my check up.
Arms strong from lifting tecs up.
Pussy nigga, throw your set up.
I dare a nigga disrespect us.
Baldy World, nigga Steve Drive.
No, we not tryna ceasefire.
Grippin tools like some new pliers.
Steamin niggas cuz we keep irons.
Ima do the dash like Stello.
Up this gun, nigga Hello.
We got the same pipes as Halo.
Choppa leave a nigga with a Halo.
Catch his ass in Rush Hour.
.40 kicking like Jackie Chan.
Taurus on me like the Son of Sam.
No remorse, bitch this gun'll blam.
Bitch i'm high as fuck.
Niggas that's a must.
We don't fuck around.
Bitch don't play with us.
Glizzys, XD's, bitch they stay with us.
You can yo mothafuckin tader bust.
We 600 deep, bitch the gang with us.
Got yo boots on better lace em up.
.40 turn yo ass to some angel dust, NIGGA.

From a different cloth, I don't rock with niggas.
Breez0 the trending topic nigga.
Like a lil kid with a rubberband.
All I wanna do is just pop a nigga.
Middle fingas to the oppa niggas.
30 singing like the Opera nigga.
.223's will Waka Flocka a nigga.
Like a record label, bitch we droppin niggas.
Keep a Tommy on me cuz im stupid cold.
Blow a nigga with the snub nose.
Aim at your chest just to lift his soul.
Bitch we riding round with a couple poles.
Got ya gun on you bitch you better blow.
Put a .4-5 in a nigga face like i'm Bruh Man from the 5th Floor.
