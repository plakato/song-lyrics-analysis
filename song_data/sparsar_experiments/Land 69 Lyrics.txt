69:Sit back and relax and relieve your mind.
And get ready for the trip to Land sixty-nine.
Where the girls are fine and full of fun.
And they outnumber guys like ten to one.
We got trains, planes, and other thangs.
Like Dom Perignon and chicken wangs.
And a motel you can lodge at.
And plenty clothes for the big money boys to flodge at.
Yeah, it's the place to be.
Guys gotta pay but girls get in free.
So, come on and have a ball.
Bring a comb, a toothbrush, and extra draws.
And I hate for you to miss it all.
So, you better move swift shoot the gif and get your tickets y'all.
So, tune your radio in.
Cause the sixty-nine tickets go to caller number ten.
