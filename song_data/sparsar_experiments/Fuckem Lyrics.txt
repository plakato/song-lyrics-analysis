Fuckem Lyrics
by 4th25.


I hear is momma cryin 
But. I still scream fuckem 
Unload my magazine on this buster 
That's. How I say fuckem 
You know we don't trust, em, 
 
Let them all lie dead in a dirt bed; 
With a bullet in his head, 
Rest in peace to all my soldiers. 
Got a lot on my head, 
 
Now turn the combinations 
To release my thoughts, 
Im fed up with all this 
Save. The word talk, 
 
Right heres were the fuckem starts 
And. The piece stops: 
Fuckem 
 
If. He ain't got no food, 
Fuckem 
 
If. He ain't got no shoes 
Cause, I 
Got everything to live for 
He got nothing to lose… fuckem 
 
I know my thoughts are not fair, 
But im fighting for my country, 
And. I wonder sometimes 
If my country even cares. 
 
But fuckem 
 
If. He pull that trigger once 
Man he'll. Do it again 
So when he ran out a bullets. Put the weapon down. 
He must a thought. The violence was gon end 
, 
Fuckem, 
, 
Killem alls. What my heart say: 
So my finger, gladly replies 
With a 5.56 or a 7.62 
Right between his eyes, fuckem 
 
5 to 55. My bullets don't discriminate 
So. If you think that im wrong 
Get me outta here, 
You can gladly take my place. Fuckem 
 
This is war round. Here 
When we see um fuckem 
Everybody on the streets. 
When we see um fuckem, 
, 
They callin cease fires 
But they keep firin fuckem 
I got no love for them. 
Pussy niggas here fuckem 
 
They, trying to see us all dead over here, fuckem 
But. I ain't trying to get bled over here. Fuckem 
They even look like they bout to do something: 
Lay em down, put 50 rounds in they stomach fuckem, 
, 
Started, off kinda, professional 
But. Now this shit is personal. 
Niggas learn when red crosses 
And sirens come to they rescue 
 
And, its always getting serious 
When hot barrels get pointed at you, 
Don't give a fuck about yalls lives, 
Now that im guarding mine, more careful, 
 
Treat everyday, just the like the first day. 
Examples can be made out you 
And any day could be your last day. 
And experience won't help you 
 
And I'll, be damned if im scared. 
Cause me runnin is not an issue. 
And just think 
Somebody at the crib might miss you, 
 
Wish, your wife and children. 
Wishin For you stepped they woulda kissed, you 
When. All that be said is daddy died, 
Bein, a damn fool, 
 
If! You got nothing to lose 
Take a chance when convoys ride. Thru 
50 cals and 240's 
Like 360's and quarter miles dude 
 
And, its always getting serious 
Just thought. I would remind you 
Niggas thought: process, delirious, 
Not chancing. What the next might do, 
 
And, I still don't think y'all hearin 
Even, though y'all should find time to 
You, can love us and never hate us 
And. That'S the bottom line: dude 
 
Just puttem on the same block with me, 
Im poppin off till all 7 
Of. These magazines is empty 
No. They will not get me 
, 
Though they've come close to hittin me. 
So far, they missed me. 
Only managed to piss me off 
Now. I react more quickly, 
 
And! I will never lay down 
Nor. Will anybody with me 
Keep my boots laced up 
Tighter than fuck… lets go 
 
Till we dead in the street 
Or its time to come home 
Yeah. We don held down the block, 
4 mofuckers strong, 
 
And. We don popped off a few times 
New. We was dead wrong, 
Wish they'd, let god judgem 
Cause. My judgement is off 
 
And, though I try not to playem 
They hand me his role 
So in his image I judgem 
Fuckem. They got to go 
 
No, I ain't trying to be they jury 
But. This is all they'll. Give me 
So in return. All I can givem 
Is a vcerdict of guilty. 
 
And carry out they sentence of death. 
For, they kill me. They self 
They, trying to dance with the devil. 
But. I only dance by myself… fuckem
