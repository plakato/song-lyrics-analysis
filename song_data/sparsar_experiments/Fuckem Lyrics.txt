Fuckem Lyrics
by 4th25.


I hear is momma cryin.
But I still scream fuckem.
Unload my magazine on this buster.
That's how I say fuckem.
You know we don't trust em.

Let them all lie dead in a dirt bed.
With a bullet in his head.
Rest in peace to all my soldiers.
Got a lot on my head.

Now turn the combinations.
To release my thoughts.
Im fed up with all this.
Save the word talk.

Right heres were the fuckem starts.
And the piece stops.
Fuckem.

If he ain't got no food.
Fuckem.

If he ain't got no shoes.
Cause I.
Got everything to live for.
He got nothing to lose… fuckem.

I know my thoughts are not fair.
But im fighting for my country.
And I, wonder sometimes.
If my country even cares.

But fuckem.

If he pull that trigger once.
Man he'll do it again.
So when he ran out a bullets put the weapon down.
He must a thought the violence was gon end.

Fuckem.

Killem alls what my heart say.
So my finger gladly replies.
With a 5.56, or a 7.62.
Right between his eyes fuckem.

5 to 55  my bullets don't discriminate.
So if you think that im wrong.
Get me outta here.
You can gladly take my place fuckem.

This is war round here.
When we see um fuckem.
Everybody on the streets.
When we see um fuckem.

They callin cease fires.
But they keep firin fuckem.
I got no love for them.
Pussy niggas here fuckem.

They trying to see us all dead over here fuckem.
But I ain't trying to get bled over here fuckem.
They even look like they bout to do something.
Lay em down put 50 rounds in they stomach fuckem.

Started off kinda professional.
But now this shit is personal.
Niggas learn when red crosses.
And sirens come to they rescue.

And its always getting serious.
When hot barrels get pointed at you.
Don't give a fuck about yalls lives.
Now that im guarding mine more careful.

Treat everyday just the like the first day.
Examples can be made out you.
And any day could be your last day.
And experience won't help you.

And I'll be damned if im scared.
Cause me runnin is not an issue.
And just think.
Somebody at the crib might miss you.

Wish your wife and children.
Wishin For you stepped they woulda kissed you.
When all that be said is daddy died.
Bein a damn fool.

If you got nothing to lose.
Take a chance when convoys ride thru.
50 cals and 240's.
Like 360's and quarter miles dude.

And its, always getting serious.
Just thought I would remind you.
Niggas thought process delirious.
Not chancing what the next might do.

And I still don't think y'all hearin.
Even though y'all should find time to.
You can love us and never hate us.
And that's the bottom line dude.

Just puttem on the same block with me.
Im poppin off till all 7.
Of these magazines is empty.
No, they will not get me.

Though they've come close to hittin me.
So far they missed me.
Only managed to piss me off.
Now I react more quickly.

And I will never lay down.
Nor will anybody with me.
Keep my boots laced up.
Tighter than fuck… lets go.

Till we dead in the street.
Or its time to come home.
Yeah we don held down the block.
4 mofuckers strong.

And we don popped off a few times.
New we was dead wrong.
Wish they'd let god judgem.
Cause my judgement is off.

And though I try not to playem.
They hand me his role.
So in his image I judgem.
Fuckem they got to go.

No I ain't trying to be they jury.
But this is all they'll give me.
So in return all I can givem.
Is a vcerdict of guilty.

And carry out they sentence of death.
For they kill me they self.
They trying to dance with the devil.
But I only dance by myself… fuckem.
