The opera Lyrics
by Vitas.

My house has been built but I am alone here.
The door banged behind my back.
An autumn wind is knocking on the window.
Crying over me all over again....
Thunderstorm at night and fog in the morning....
The sun has turned completely cold.
Old pains are following one another.
Let them all get together!
My house has been built but I am alone here.
The door banged behind my back.
An autumn wind is knocking on the window.
Crying over me all over again....
This is Fate and I can't.
Ask anything of Fate!
I just know how the winds.
Will be wailing after I'm gone.
