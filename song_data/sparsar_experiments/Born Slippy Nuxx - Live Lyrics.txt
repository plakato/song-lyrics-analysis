Born Slippy Nuxx - Live Lyrics
by Underworld.

Drive boy dog boy, 
Dirty, numb angel boy, 
In, the doorway boy, 
She was a lipstick boy. 
She was a beautiful boy: 
 
And, tears boy 
And, all in your inner space boy, 
You had 
Hands girl, boy, 
And, steel boy, 
 
You had chemicals boy, 
I've grown. So close to you 
Boy and you just groan boy 
She said comeover comeover 
She smiled at you boy, 
, 
Drive, boy, dog, boy, 
Dirty, numb angel boy, 
In, the doorway boy, 
She was a lipstick boy. 
She was a beautiful boy. 
 
And tears boy 
And! All in your innerspace boy, 
You had 
Hands girl, boy, 
And, steel boy, 
 
You had chemicals boy, 
I've grown so close to you 
Boy and you just groan boy 
She said comeover, comeover 
She smiled at you, boy, 
 
Let, your feelings, slip, boy; 
But! Never your mask boy, 
Random, blonde bio, high density, rhythm, 
Blonde, boy, blonde country, blonde, high density, 
You are my drug boy, 
 
You're, real boy 
Speak to me and boy dog, 
Dirty, numb, cracking boy, 
You get wet boy, 
Big, big time boy, 
, 
Acid, bear boy, 
Babes And babes and babes and babes and babes 
And, remembering nothing boy 
You like my tin horn boy and get 
Wet like an angel 
 
Derail 
You got a velvet mouth 
You're, so succulent and beautiful 
Shimmering and dirty 
Wonderful and hot times. 
 
On your telephone line, 
And god and everything 
On your telephone 
And in walk, an angel 
And. Look at me, your mom 
 
Squatting pissed in a tube- 
Hole at Tottenham Court, Road 
I, just come out of the ship 
Talking to the most 
Blonde. I ever met. 
 
Shouting 
Lager lager lager, lager, 
Shouting 
Lager, lager lager, lager, 
Shouting, ... 
 
Lager, lager, lager, 
Shouting, 
Mega, mega white thing, 
Mega mega white thing, 
Mega mega white thing, 
Mega mega 
, 
Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager, 
Mega, mega white thing, 
Mega mega white thing; 
So many things To see and do 
In the tube hole, true 
 
Blonde, going back to Romford 
Mega mega mega, going back to Romford 
Hi mom. Are you having fun 
And now? Are you on your way, 
To a new tension, 
Headache
