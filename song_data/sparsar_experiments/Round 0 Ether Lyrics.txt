Round 0 Ether Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

Fuck RG!

Fuck RG!

What the fuck is this shit? American idol?
Motherfuckers singing in a rap contest like it's a piano recital.
Judges, doctors will think this is strange, get a klonopin script.
I'm bashing your heads 6x and in your mouth I'm shoving shit.
Completely corrupt; no way this shit isn't political.
Rhyming homie with homie 5 times and it's not even lyrical.
How much did these pussies pay you, man, I hope it was worth it.
Because your reputations are lost my rhymes were ethereal.
Keep gossiping like bitches; typing all up in editor chat.
Justifying that you can judge, motherfuckers then let's hear you rap.
Yea Mykro was wack, but the other entries were strong?
ScopeY is a moderator of course he's gonna move on.
Tyrosine's top sixteen was dope most people agreed.
Then judges fuck it up and expect everyone to be pleased?
I'm an editor right now, if I'm not tomorrow don't be surprised.
Because I spoke what's real, what's true, not just buying into lies.
Go ahead, say I'm salty, or am I just right?
Keep that front up for the forum, but we know the truth at the end of night.
Check your shit for next round, last one was a joke.
I was top 32, didn't say I was GOAT.
Not dissing the competitors, nah, just the judges who vote.
Just know next year I'm coming for your motherfucking THROATS!
