WHAT WAS IT WORTH Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.

HEY ASSHOLE.
COWBOY'S WASTED.
YER FRESH OUTTA FRIENDS.

Tropic thunder.
Land down under.
Over there.
Shave my hair.
Thousand yard stare.
Gunsmoke in the air.
And flames.
Even when it rains.
Which is all the time.
Can't wash off my grime.
From this place.
Wiped out a whole fuckin race.
Burn the trace.
Piss where they once ate.
No more.
Dicks fallin off sleepin wit whores.
Fuck war.
Saigon.
Why'd I gon?
Cause i'm a hero.
Death count zero.
For now.
Till tomorrow come around.
Always lookin down.
At the ground.
Bombs.
John's scared.
I don't fucking care.
Dry shit in underwear.
Papa bear comin thru.
Dust off, 1 2.
Foxtrot, we can't hear you.
Do another run over ma-hee-wa-hee-lee-hoo.
See em how we do.
When they seein two.
Lucy got me see through.
Hey did you see who.
Shot mine.
Blood soakin thru my peace sign.
No time to whine.
Jus another parta the grind.
Jungle rhythm.
Take me with em.
At least away from here.
For a fatty an a cold beer.
With no fears.
Death's always near.
Come with me dear.
Show you my humpin gear.

Backups gettin thin.
Never gonna win.
Tryna get out but stay in.
Tact.
In fact fuck that.
I wanna be a fuckin tunnel rat.
Leave the colt rollin wit the ol school baseball bat.
Not dyin lame.
Goin out with 12 heads and a handle to my name.
Vietname.
What was it worth.
Fifty years later moms still givin fucked up births.
Agent Orange.

Nothing rhymes with Agent Orange.
