I Got Da Feelin' Lyrics
by Sweet Tee.

I got this.
Feelin, and it's makin me break in-.
To a cold sweat when-.
Ever I'm present, it doesn't.
Matter how long, if you wasn't.
Down from now on, you'll be a-.
Round to count on this.
Feeling, put you down with the program.
Like I am, so just.
Dance till you feel how I feel now.
Sweet Tee's cold rockin the crowd.
Turn up the music, I'm a fanatic.
Make it heard from basement to attic.

Sweet Tee is fact, not fiction.
On the records you hear me rhymin'.
On the charts you see me climbin'.
To the top of the deck, and I'm dealin'.
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin'.

Now's the time, so check your Timex.
Hold tight while I take you to the climax.
Of the music, yeah, that'll work.
Get on the dance floor, go berzerk.
Tee is here to let you know that.
You others got to go.
I'm steppin' hard, steppin' strong.
Step out my way or, get stepped on.
I entertain, make you go insane.
Stick with me when I'm on the mic, and.
You'll feel no pain, I'll keep you up.
Like a cup of Seneca.
Get down like a sailboat anchor.
I'm on a roll, and I'm wheelin'.
I'm Sweet Tee, and I got the feelin'.

Stop and - ehm, listen to the rhythm of.
Sweet Tee, then fall in love.
Cause I'm hype, Tee's on the mic.
When I do it, I do it right.
Minx? is on the cuts and.
She makes party people shake their butts and.
She gets busy, she ain't no joke.
And with Tee on the mic you know we dope.
In demand.
As I expand.
I know how, so here and now.
I'll take my stand, this ain't no.
Game, I ain't playin.
Listen to the words I'm sayin'.
At the top of the deck, and I'm dealin'.
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin'.

Now what I want you to do is.
Get wet, let yourself perspire.
Get hot like your body's on fire.
Get ready, so you can observe.
The man with the beats, make it funky, Hurb.

If it feels good, then prove it.
On the dance floor, y'all, move it.
Start sweatin', cause I'm lettin' me.
Be real good, no one's forgettin' me.
I'm good to go, yo.
I'm not a amateur, Tee's a pro, so.
I give no slack, cause it's like that.
I'll be back, Jack, cause I got the feelin.

If it feels good.

If it feels good.

If it feels good, then prove it.
On the dance floor, y'all, move it.
