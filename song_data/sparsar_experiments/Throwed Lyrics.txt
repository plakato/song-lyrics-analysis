Throwed Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


Ha come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
5th Ward Weebie got the girls you know.
Swisha-Swish-Swishahouse, got the girls with us.
See up in this building right now, Fat Boy Entertainment.
Swishahouse baby, we gon do it like this here.
Rock with me, rock with me, rock with me.

I'm looking for a girl, that's throwed.
Nice feet, ice white teeth that's throwed.
The way she backing and working that thang, that's throwed.
6-5-4 she high, now let's go oh.

5th Ward Weebie.
You gotta rock-rock-rock-rock-rock the boat.
I heard you was a head hunter, with a sloppy throat.
Now like a man, come and break it off and let Weebie you understand.
Now you know this boy go off.
Now come on baby won't you back it up, I'm about to smack it up.
That ass sitting low, so I guess I gotta jack it up.
Put you on the wall and make you holla, ooh daddy.
Call your other girl, and toss that thang like a salad.
No I ain't no freak, I'm just a little bit nasty.
I like a one night stand, I ain't trying to get married.
5th Ward Weebie, got them girls going crazy.
After I get with em, they be trying to have babies.
Look at shorty she throwed, she working that there.
Fat Boy Entertainment, gon serve that there.
You know I like 'em throwed off, first time clothes off.
Shit I ain't tripping, I got plenty I could roll something.

Mike Jones.
I want a cutie, that could drop it like it's hot.
And do tricks with the booty.
A floozy that'll straight up, tell me she wanna do me.
A girl that can twerk and squirt on it, like she knew me.
In the streets she classy, in the sheets she nasty.
Doing shit for me without me even much asking.
Mike Jones, she's 36-25-34.
Cute face slim waste, need I say more.
These girls, in Clutch City.
Come equipped, with big hips lips and titties them big old thangs.
You wanna jump in leather wood, then drop your g-string.
Let your tongue hang, and show off your tongue ring.
Now play with it, slowly lick your lips with it.
And show all the tricks, that you can do with it.
That g-string you got on, got everybody watching.
Niggas bopping, and them hating hoes knocking.
Cause your feet really nice, your teeth ice white.
You the throwed lil' mama, I been looking for all night.
So just come with Mike Jones, walk with Mike Jones.
So when I'm done with your ass, you gon crawl for Mike Jones.

Choppa.
You don't want it with me, I'm just popular.
Now these people, pay to party with me.
I got girls in the V.I.P., getting it on.
And they ain't leaving, till they show they thong.
Some slim some big, some know they wrong.
But they all act a fool, when they hear my song.
I'm Choppa-Choppa, yeah I got another one.
Street baller Body Head, did I-did I stutter son.
I'm wilding out, off a bottle of Henn.
Got a line of girls waiting, at the Holiday Inn.
Mike Jones and Choppa-Chop, always flocking 'em in.
But I'm stopping again, cause she ain't hot as your friend.
Yeah I told your girl, don't hate a playa.
But if you is a throwed chick, you can page a playa.
I heard 5th Ward Weebie, got them hoes off the heezie.
Your boy lil' Choppa, bout to break 'em off proper.
And I heard, when she want the right song.
Who she call for Mike Jones, holla at your boy.
Houston and New Orleans, ain't no way you gon serve me.
Choppa-Choppa hold it down, representing that Dirty.

She want Chop-Chop.
She love Chop-Chop - 3x.
She want, she want, she want, she want.
She want Mike Jones - 4x.
She want, she want, she want, she want.
She want, she want.
