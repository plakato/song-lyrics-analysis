Rock the Body Lyrics
by Queen Pen.

The password is party.

T. Lee.
Ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
For the 98 this is how we do.
Queen Pen ya'll, T. Lee ya'll.
Rock on ya'll, D-Dot ya'll.
Come On.

Queen Pen.
For all the honeys in the ghetto that's holdin their own.
T. Lee.
For all my puffed out dogs in the club thugged out.
Queen Pen.
And if ya know that it's a fact that we got your back.
T. Lee.
Ain't no doubt Queen and Tray Lee turn it out.

Tracey Lee.
Lyrically i spray ya'll it's Tray ya'll.
Slay ya'll niggas it ain't hard to face me.
Break ya'll niggas like A.C.
Stay armed in case these cats want to hate on me.
Kill or be killed I'm God sent.
My callin' make shit bounce like Spaulding.
Ya'll know cuevo make Tray flow en fuego.
Its T. Lee spittin' and I'm down with the Queen.

Queen Pen.
Radio play just really advances my chances.
With big time niggas holdin legal finances.
Ghetto star just about the whole of my life.
Got eyes in the back of my head like mice.
With ya chat bad boy, I lived it.
I figure you just wake up in the morning.
And blame it on a nigga.
You's the type of nigga.
I leave standin' at the bar.
Have your thirsty ass waitin for my car tomorrow.
It's them lame chicks that fuck it up for us.
Runnin around the club bein a bag of darts.
A bonafide child not like years in diss.
Holdin down fort real Brooklyn shit.
Weed rolled in fry talon dreads swa rich.
Ain't nothin changed since '86.
We stopped transportin' start makin hits.
Ghetto from the start Queen represent.

Queen Pen.
For all the honeys in the ghetto that's holdin their own.
T. Lee.
For all my puffed out dogs in the club thugged out.
Queen Pen.
And if ya know that it's a fact that we got your back.
T. Lee.
Ain't no doubt Queen and Tray Lee turn it out.

Queen Pen.
Niggas talk shit on the regular.
And those be the ones that sweatin ya'll.
Wether east or west D servin ya'll.
Tray Lee and the Queen Pen murderer.
If it's not real boo, why bother.
Tell me why window shop with bags of copper.
Jack yo ass up like my baby father.
Jack yo ass up like my baby father.

Tracey Lee.
When Tray Lee come through it's party time.
But a party ain't a party till you spark a dime.
Ya'll can hate but i'm still gonna make ass shake.
Still got the steel by the waist runnin through ya'll.
Me and Queen Pen find us at the bar schemin.
I still owe dough.
So who i gotta get to break even.
RNF niggas who live for the weekend.
Stil drinkin, hey! stil leavin the club with hoes.
They seen us on Keenan.
You dealin with pros, Goddamn.
Future of the game turnin cats into what happen to's.
Like Brains, Tray ain't change.
Still spit on, still ride everything that I get on.
Still be in the club with Tims on.
Raw dog forever.
I got somethin for all ya'll.
Whatever!

Queen Pen.
For all the honeys in the ghetto that's holdin their own.
T. Lee.
For all my puffed out dogs in the club thugged out.
Queen Pen.
And if ya know that it's a fact that we got your back.
T. Lee.
Ain't no doubt Queen and Tray Lee turn it out.

T. Lee.
Hey! Well alright, uh-huh.
It don't stop ya'll, B-rock y'all.
From Brooklyn to Philly.
It's Queen Pen and T. Lee.

Queen Pen.
For all the honeys in the ghetto that's holdin their own.
T. Lee.
For all my puffed out dogs in the club thugged out.
Queen Pen.
And if ya know that it's a fact that we got your back.
T. Lee.
Ain't no doubt Queen and Tray Lee turn it out.

Rock the body rock, rock the body rock.....
