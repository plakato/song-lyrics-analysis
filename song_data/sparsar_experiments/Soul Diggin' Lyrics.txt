Soul Diggin' Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.


Soul-searchin', soul diggin', whatever you want to call it.
Walkin', gettin' mind off thoughts, I can't befall them.
Immortal artist, spittin' catharsis, above the darkness.
Above the sun, I am the farthest, steppin' in, I am Colossus.
Said forget about emotions, I tend to use my heart less.
I am not heartless, just stay.
chillin' on the surface.
Lookin' for purpose, prophets lookin' for some profit is a contradiction.

Reckless rappers lack description in they rhyme depictions.
Who could blame em'? Fuck the profit!
Wisdom-gossipin', unh, I'm stoppin' in, philosophin'.
Belong to no place, straight goin' Machiavellian, steady yen.
Fade to the light like a chameleon.
Deep breathin', nice dreamin', why stay seekin' this meanin'?
Why stay greivin' over shit you don't wanna get caught in?
I be believin' in some shit I really want to fight for.

Thought I lost my soul, been searchin' for another.
Diggin' in reality, stormin' through the thunder.
Sometimes I just sit here and just wonder.
Sometimes I just here and just wonder.
Thought I lost my soul, been searchin' for another.
Diggin' in reality, stormin' through the thunder.
Sometimes I just sit here and just wonder.
Sometimes I just here and just wonder.

Truth or truth and you're playin' with the one and only.
When the mask comes off and then you start sayin'.
What really clutters your mind, and then you start prayin'.
That you could get some direction, you're just star gazin'.
Look.
I been down this path more than once before.
I'm bull headed so you know that it's been once or more.
Tell me, how could you respect another man's opinion.
Knowin' that they guy is more fucked up than you are?
Ah!
And you wonder why I'm stubborn.
I'm more intelligent than motherfuckers who are double.
My age so when they try to put me in my place.
I'm not rebellious but I will call a spade a spade.
I will disrespect, I will innovate.
I will look inside myself, I will believe that I will succeed.
And if my mind state shall get me into trouble?
I'll look inside my own soul, just pass me back the shovel.
Vita!

Vita Et Mors and Negrostotle.
Thought I lost my soul, been searchin' for another.
Diggin' in reality, stormin' through the thunder.
Sometimes I just sit here and just wonder.
Sometimes I just here and just wonder.
Thought I lost my soul, been searchin' for another.
Diggin' in reality, stormin' through the thunder.
Sometimes I just sit here and just wonder.
Sometimes I just here and just wonder.
