The Dive Lyrics
by Quarta Quarta.


Chamber of my soul, my footsteps echo.
Life was easier when the creek was next to the meadow.
Strings attached like Kankuro and Geppetto.
Makes me tell you that I'm fine, clearly a falsetto.
Exercise caution when I let go of my energy.
Spirit bomb, Kaioken, I exercise differently.
Super Saiyan with the pen versus all the industry.
I don't need to sell just to find some validity.
I don't need this sin, I just need the Holy Trinity.
I don't need the fear, I just need the possibility.
You lie to my face, say you're never giving up on me.
But you never answer, and it leaves me reluctantly.
Calling for help, trusting a friend, trusting myself.
Bandaging my body trying to stabilize my health.
Message in a bottle, but they threw it overboard.
Now the message is this song, it washed up on my shore.
Fell into my hands, I knew it was something more.
Because the Dive is the reason why we haven't ended war.
Look in the mirror, in your eyes, in the sink.
Ponder on the fact that your ambition is on the brink.
Of extinction. Maximillion Pegasus.
Saw the hand, relinquished all of the evidence.
Until I go ghost at Danny Phantom's residence.
Ima make the future absolutely greater than its ever been.

Break.

Ima make the future absolutely greater than its ever been.
