Chapel Trill Lyrics
by X Blake Freeman X.


I was tellin' labels ''Please don't ignore us''.
With nothin' even recorded.
Now they see why it's important.

My girl is friggin' gorgeous.
We can kick it in her city or just rock it in my forest.
I got a million memories with a few pictures.
Excitement here and there from her favorites on Twitter.
A trophy of what I'll have and that makes me a winner.

Breakdown.
X.

I'm wide awake but I still dream.
To follow in the foot steps of James Dean.
Y'all still don't know what my X's mean.
I don't play Xbox and I'm before Scene.
Sell anything but propane to be king of the hill.
End it all like Cobain if I don't get the sales.
I done changed the face of rap, I done changed Chapel Hill.
I mean let's face the facts, I'd say I've earned the deal.

X.
