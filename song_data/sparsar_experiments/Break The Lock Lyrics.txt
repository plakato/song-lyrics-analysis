Break The Lock Lyrics
by Ty.

Uh, uh, uh, hardcore, niggas)!
Uh, uh, uh, hardcore, j-j-j yeah... er....
Alright, well... got my shit down here... smoke that shit....
We bout to just do some nice stuff here wassup....
Aaaaaaaaaaaah....

UH! My style hurts doesn't it?
Turn around and your hole crews loving it.
Uh, you tried stiff neck thugging it.
Couldn't sleep cause your mind had a bug in it.
Buzzing without weed, extract.
And you thought I wasn't coming? Well you need a slap.

Wait, fore warning you of the coming of kong.
Come on, splash little fishy can you swim in the pond?
Are you that, breaking the wall will your building respond?
To the pressure, walking with the strength of my predecessor.
Ancient, I never walk alone.
I'm up against the stereo-mono-typical.
Visualising wealth is not applicable.
Now, my brain cries out for me to read.
With movement inspired by Johnsy D and Benjy Read.

The Globe keeps spinning.
But I ain't moving.
We can't keep joking.
Break the lock if the door's not open now.
The Globe keeps spinning.
But I ain't moving.
We can't keep joking.
Break the lock if the door's not open now.

Concepts get abandoned with no gloves.
Traditional trends evaporate like soap suds.
The innercity whirlpool will suck you up like.
A person with a temper can fuck you up right?
Time to bring back down to syndromes.
Custard in your eye like Bugsy Malone.
You need to stay calm with napalm attached to ya.
Embrace arm in gasoline strike a match to ya.
Now, now do you feel enlightened?
Well I don't and I'm the one writing.
Anything versus everything really means nothing.
Can't be a king peacock - I hate strutting.
Dressed up semi-jiggy I might frustrate somethin'.
A lion in the wardrobe is ready to break somethin'.
Mr Fantastic Fox.
The Awkward individ' that makes the wack  hot.
My jazz addiction is a preminition of war.
When visible tussels appear on the dance floor.
The sweat breaks to the beat, freak of the month, year, decade.
Vacuum the essay, now lets say.
I'm one in a million, a million in one room.
You want an interview with the killer of monsoons?
I'll sing sonnets to don and donnettes, ok?
I'm terrible with a broom sweeping your mess away.

...two, three, break! x3.
