4s Lyrics
by Punsy.

I come with a craft that some of you lack untouchable, stats
I'm, crushing you cats like when you place your thumb on a gnat
Get snuffed in a flash, I'm busting, your ass punch, you so fast
Your, lungs'll collapse and you'll be laying slump on the grass
Then stuffed in a Sack pummeled with bats punctured and stabbed
Then covered with gas burned, with a match to bundles of ash
I'll chuckle and laugh you're. Nothing but wack, stuck with the fads
Of clutching the gat, with hundreds of tats and drugs in your bag
It sucks cause. You act so tough in your raps, none of it's fact
You tuck in your sack and cover your vag with one of them pads
You've summoned my wrath. punishing brats like mothers and dads
I'm coming to rap. Your careers will plummet and crash
Running this class that none of you passed you're coming in last
Hot as running in the sun in Iraq during summer in black
My, hunger is maxed. lunching on cats. til. My stomach is fat
A monster in rap. My champ's belt is buckled and strapped
You beating me. You have a better chance of dunking on shaq
I'm the future. The front of the pack you're stuck in the past
My sound, is like a thunderous, clap, rupturing glass
You sound like you're drunk from a flask mumbling crap
You should bungie jump with nothing attached or clutched to your back
Your structure is bad pulling us down like buckets of crabs
If you're. A wonderful act then teddy ruxbin's, a cat
That's. Why I got it covered like caps, I'm done it's a wrap
