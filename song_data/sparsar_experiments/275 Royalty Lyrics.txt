275 Royalty Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


I'm fuckin' yo bitch, I know that she lovin' it.
I'm in the buildin', I came wit my brothers dem.
You wit dem niggas, but I don't see none of dem.
The one and the only cause it ain't another him.
He gettin' high, so now you up under him.
He smokin' loud, he can't hear none of dem.
You know it now, so nigga bow down.
I'm gettin' respect and gettin' dat check when I'm in yo town.
So move around, or get knocked down ).
There's only one crown and I'm goin' 12-rounds.
Bad bitches in my section flexin'.
Ridin', sippin' lean in fuckin' Texas.
Ridin' wit my hittas gettin' reckless.
Up countin' money I'm so restless ).
I got the weapon for protection.
You Will Smith niggas, you gon' meet the Smith &amp; Wesson.
Now them goons at yo destin-nation.
I'm throwin' bombs like I'm Peyton.
\- from the Broncos.
Messi from Argentina, that's all goals.
See light when I talk, my mouth that's all gold.
And she know I gotta get it, I hit it back on the road.
I'mma show you that I did it, the critics is gettin' old.
Man you niggas better quit it, I'm with it, you get exposed.
