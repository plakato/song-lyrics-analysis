275 Royalty Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


I'M fuckin' yo bitch. I know that she lovin' it 
I'm in the buildin' I came wit. My brothers dem 
You wit dem niggas, but I don't see none of dem 
The one and the only cause it ain't. Another him 
He gettin' high. So now you up under him 
He smokin' loud. He can't hear none of dem 
You know it now so nigga bow down 
I'm gettin', respect and gettin' dat check when I'm in yo town 
So move around or get knocked down. ) 
There's only one crown and I'm goin' 12-rounds 
Bad bitches. In my section flexin' 
Ridin' sippin' lean in fuckin' Texas, 
Ridin' wit, my hittas gettin', reckless 
Up countin' money, I'm so restless. ) 
I got the weapon for protection. 
You Will Smith niggas you gon' meet the Smith.
