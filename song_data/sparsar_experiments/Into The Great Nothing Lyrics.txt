Into The Great Nothing Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Sadly aware I'm part of what I concider nothing.
Suffocating us while we pretend we're blind.
Before tired eyes, those who cling to nothing.
We embrace the echoes of our hollow souls.
Values of life have changed currency somehow.
Pockets lined with greed and shallow smiles of need.
Somewhere we lost sight of who we are.
Now more is more, less is nothing.
All we need is ‘need', a glass full of ‘me'.
As we toast to madness we find fulfillment in.
All this wealth is deafening, deafening our minds.
As we all stray further into the great nothing…

Corroded, corrupted… I sell my soul again.

Infected, dissected… I sell myself and die.
Trapped in my addiction, outside looking in.
The sound of silence, colours fade to grey.
My remorse is not enough, I have gone too far.
I've reached the end of my winding road.
Now that I've bared my weakness to you.
I beg of you to hear me; never follow me.
See how my fragile shell is breaking.
I beg of you to see me, see the great King Nothing.

Corroded, corrupted… I sell my soul again.

Infected, dissected… I sell myself and die.

Corroded, corrupted… I sell my soul again.

Infected, dissected… I sell myself and die.
