California Sun Lyrics
by VonBock.

Man.
I remember back in the day I used to be on that ? fresh shit.
Now.
I mean even now that I've.
Moved up a couple years, I could get a little bit more, you know.
That GDP, Purple K, OGK.
You know whatever your linked up with it's all good with me.
But if you got that purp..and you see me...
Wave me over, let me get a little trey puff on that.
I might not give it back though.

Aye.
I'm low as possible every aspect.
Eyes low, Hydro, working on this new project.

Sixteen spat even more thrown away.
Other I forget, cuz my brain's blown away.
Hurricane head band, thrown you in a storm.
I'm a category five wreck bout to drop the bomb.

My storm search was drowned.
Tryna rise, push down.
Tryna light get clowned.
I'm respect all in my town.

For splitting grams, hitting hands, paper that's the dividends.
$20 choice is yours, you take then you roll it in.
My methodology seems to be a policy that's hesitant.
Low economy, no responsibility, I'm just too God damn proud with this.

I hold this purp, I'm firm with the staines.
Relaxing in the sun, thank God for Cali's plants.
I'm real low but I'm high'd up.
Getcha Yeska bitch, go and rise up.

Oh, so low.
California sun got me feeling so slow.
So slow.
Oh Yeah.

I'm backed, I'm vaped, I'm living of the ?
Southern California is the home where I create.
I gotta stay real, cuz I'm the realest, respect it.
He is struggling, Imma let you buy my method.

Peep game, peep the rhymes the with the emphasis.
And make sure that you keep them eyes open, when look at this.

A 1/5 to sip on.
1/8 to get my spliff.
Girl to put my dick on.
I get it off when I want.
