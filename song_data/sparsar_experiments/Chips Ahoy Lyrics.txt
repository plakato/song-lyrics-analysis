Chips Ahoy Lyrics
by Uno Hype.

Smoke DZA Talking: Fuck the hype,.
nigga I'm dead nice. Higher than my mutha fuckin light bill in the summer.

Cool, however you wan do it.
My goons Trinidadian my lawyers Jewish.
First nigga in my hood to make money off music.
We don't entertain beef we stew it.
Two â€“two it four-five it so violent.
Potato over the 8-0 breathe slow I-ya.
Niggas baggin and they soundin like custies.
Used to be slim but Philippe got me huskies.
Think shit sweet then its bound to get ugly.
Don't get your whole shit patched up like a rug be.
Ain't nothing to it I stay cool like a AC breeze.
Come gamble wit ya boy I got ac cheese.
Rock polo boots? No ACG's.
No pussy getting nigga fuck you ain't seen green.
Leave rap alone get a job today.
Over aggressive ass niggas scare the broads away.
It's my lane and I can crossover like Hardaway.
Fall back nigga guard ya safe.

Who what too rough, kill it then it's two up.
Grew up on some two cup Houston nuisance.
UGK who else cube live crew what.
Was mom and pop lollipops nigga guess I blew up.
Bland lands to grand cans a jams cups the Reese's?
Damn Sam I scram ran and ran some polices.
Long rambled thesis that could hand stain a Jesus.
Raggedy Ann antics we grandstand to pieces.
You ain't talking fly shit nigga that's crazy.
I talk real and my shit nigga that's wavy.
Bastards a baby the reverend couldn't save me.
So you gon need an extra set of chords when you tape me.
You gon need a better set of flows if you play me.
Cuz they gone need an extra set of morgues when you face me.
So hate me cuz all the right humanoids love me.
Earth couldn't budge me, shit is ugly.
They diggin a plot I'm rippin apart.
With riddles I rock ripped em?
The simplest shot killin the block shit am I not.
Shakin ass nigga look alive when I hit ya.
Step aside while I super size up my picture.
Capture rhymes that could take the pride of a nigga.
And take the prize that I took and dive in his sister.
Apocalyptic with my narcoleptic narco scriptures.
Sleepin on it but I think its time to rock em nigga.
Bitch I'm mobbin.

I'm just bleedin from this ballpoint.
My percussion to my senoritas everything on point.
Reefer with the swisher blowin down till they can't reach us.
Fog under door vision hazy can't see us.
Kill em from a distance no need to creep up.
Paparazzi poppin girls rushin catchin seizures.
Hundred-degree fever and they hearin greatness.
Is you seein what it takes kid is you feelin what they playin.
Like what these dudes sayin can't remember I was faded.
Like these memories never stayin, I could never save em.
Like why you fools hatin plus they sayin I won't make it.
But I'm too far ahead I know my presence is waitin.
Racin with time losin my mind feels too hard to find.
Lookin for a little shine I bet they take it from me.
You could tell I'm comin I thought you as never runnin.
They better put the plug in and aim when they not lookin.
Spot token all up in ya feelins that's how I do it.
You gotta feel the movement through it all remain the truest.
Leakin on the cement and my heart beatin.
Leavin the world fiendin shit I seen em all steamin.
Plus I'm here for a reason I'm shittin on the defense.
Jumpin from the deep end nigga its our season so I.
Carry the team I think about the merrier things.
So I married my dreams get out of the way homie.
You actin obscene way before me an my niggas was packin the green.
Shit we laughin at they team.
Grindin hard on the scene man this shit ain't what it seems.
And nothing should come between the love and the work.
The stains on my shirt I gotta come in first.
You lil niggas is hurt just take it for what its worth.
My hands covered in dirt so much hunger and thirst.
But I yearn for the struggle the tell me to keep it humble nigga.
Yeah.
