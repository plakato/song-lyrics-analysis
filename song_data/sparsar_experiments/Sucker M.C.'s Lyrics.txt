Sucker M.C.'s Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

Run 
Two years ago, a friend of mine 
Asked me to say some MC rhymes 
So. I said this rhyme, I'm about to say 
The rhyme was Def a-then. It went this way, 
Took a test to become an MC 
And Orange Krush became amazed at me. 
So Larry put me inside his Cad-
illac 
The chaffeur drove off and we never came back. 
Dave cut the record down to the bone 
And. Now they got me rockin on the microphone 
And. Then we talkin autograph and cheers and laugh 
Champagne, caviar and bubble bath. 
But see ahh; ah, that's the life! Ah, that I lead 
And you sucker MC's is who I please 
So. Take that and move back catch a heart attack, 
Because, there's nothin in the world that Run'll ever lack 
I cold chill at a party in a b-boy stance. 
And rock on the mic and make the girls wan na dance 
Fly like a Dove that come from up above 
I'm rockin on the mic, and you can call me Run-Love 
 
I got a big long Caddy, not like a Seville, 
And written right on the side. It reads'Dressed to Kill' 
So. If you see me cruisin girls, just a-move or step aside 
There ain't enough room to fit you all. In my ride. 
It'S on a ah first come first serve basis. 
Coolin out girl. Take you to the def places 
One of a kind and for your people's delight 
And for you, sucker MC you just ain't right: 
Because, you're, bitin, all your life you're cheatin on your wife, 
You're walkin round town, like a hoodlum with a knife, 
You're hangin on the Ave chillin with the crew 
And, everybody know what you've been through: 
 
Ah with the one two three three to two one: 
My man, Larry Larr, my name DJ Run
 
We, do it in the place with the highs and the bass 
I'm rockin to the rhythm? Won'T you watch it on my face: 
Go Uptown and come down to the ground: 
You sucker MC's, you sad-faced clown, 
You, a five-dollar boy and I'm a-million dollar man 
Youse a sucker MC and you're. My fan 
You try to bite lines, but rhymes are mine. 
Youse, a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Klein 
Comin from the wackest part of town 
Tryin to rap up, but you can't get down 
You, don't even know your English, your verb or noun 
You're, just a sucker MC you sad-faced clown, 
So D.M.C. and if you're Ready 
The people, rockin', steady, 
You're, drivin, big cars, get your gas from Getty 
, 
D.M.C., 
I'm D.M.C. in the place to be 
I, go to St. John's University 
And since kindergarten, I acquired the knowledge 
And after 12th grade. I went straight to college 
I'm light skinned. I live in Queens 
And. I love eatin chicken and collard greens 
I dress to kill. I love the style 
I'm an MC. You know who's, versatile 
Say. I got good credit in your regards 
Got, my name, not numbers on my credit cards. 
I go Uptown. I come back home 
With who me myself and my microphone 
All. My rhymes are sweet, delight 
So, here's another one for y'all to bite 
When I rhyme I never quit 
And. If I got a new rhyme I'll just say it 
Cause. It takes a lot to entertain. 
And sucker MC's can be a pain 
You can't rock a party with the hip in hop 
You got ta, let em know you'll, never stop. 
The rhymes have to make 
You got to know where to start .
