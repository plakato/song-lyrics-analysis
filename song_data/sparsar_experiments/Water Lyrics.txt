Water Lyrics

Water, wet, water, wet, wet, water.
Wet, wet, water, wet, wet, wet, water.
Water.

She want some water mane?
I got some water.
Oh that's your daughter?
I gave her water.
I got this goop bottle here for wet water.
She ain't even pay for it, I front it.
I think I want her, she off the water.
No molly, is that a problem?
Goop bottle right next to my revolver.
My revolver right next to the water.

Water.

Gook by the dresser mane.
Boof right on schedule mane.
Get ya box, I'm flexin' mane.
Coupe by the Lexus mane.
Geetchie mane I got it mane.
Who that with the water mane?
You know I had the water mane.
I was the water mane.
Gook bottle, I'm flexing on her.
Boof batch, I got two pounds on 'em.
Thirty-two, two blocks of yack.
Sixty-two, it's jumping back.
Two blocks down we got some water.
One block down you place your order.
Monroe boys run off with packs.
Take 'em out, he got some water.

Water.
