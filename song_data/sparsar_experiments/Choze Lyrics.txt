Choze Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


Yeah, whoa.
Whoa whoa, I was choze.
Whoa whoa, I was choze.
Whoa whoa, I was.
Yeah, Yeah I ain't asked for it I was choosing.
We ain't asked for it we was choosing yeah.
I ain't asked for it but she choose me yeah.
I ain't asked for it but she choose me yeah.
I ain't asked for it but she choose me.

I ain't going back bro that's the old me.
Having no hoes that's the old me.
Whoa whoa I ain't choose it just chose me.
Whoa whoa I ain't choose that shit chose me.
Fundraising going ham with the proceeds.
Didn't have the plug on the floor seat.
If you ain't talking cash don't approach me.
Nike golf hats good approach way.

I ain't asked for it I was chosen.
We ain't asked for it we was chosen.
I ain't asked for her she just chose me.
I'll show you how to live when you're chosen yeah.
Ya yeah, when your chosen yeah.
How you live when you're chosen yeah.
Whoa whoa it just chose me yeah.

Yeah.
That's how you live when your chosen.
Hit that pussy had to let her go like Frozen.
Yeah, yea yeah, boy I'm chosen.
Oh I'm in the A real 6 no D Rose'n, damn.
It's how you live when you're chosen.
Baby I got some business you can put your nose in, yeah.
It's how I live when I'm chosen.. Yeah.
Word on the road I get flown in bit...
