Fire Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

I break the melted popsicle sticks and start the show.
Push me in the fire as you punish my soul.
I thought it was funny when the hungry would break.
Blew off every miracle I saw as a fake.
Show me something positive, I'll show you its flaw.
Try to preach your ministry, I'll shatter your jaw.
Try bringing the heat, I feel the heat on my face.
Don't you start me off with a taste, of the ogre's.

Fire baby, don't you know who we are.
Fire baby, bye bye bye bye boy.
Fire baby, don't you know where you are.
Fire baby, bye bye bye bye boy.

Tighter than a snake can wrap itself round your neck.
Watch a preying mantis eat a hole in your back.
You can see the story, he created the truth.
So much goes invisible seen only by you.
You can see me cause when you stare at the sun.
All I did to figure out, but who makes it run.
Steady pushin' barrel to the back of my head.
Anything to keep the ogre happy is enough for me.

Fire baby, don't you know who we are.
Fire baby, bye bye bye bye boy.
Fire baby, don't you know where you are.
Fire baby, bye bye bye bye boy.

I remember hearing all you voodoo doctors pray for rivers.
Hours later comes the thunder, raining showers he delivers.
Peasants fighting through the rain, they're happy that it's finally falling.
Tried and true, he's there for you again but you don't hear him calling.
Pause your life for mischief, and the mischief becomes life itself.
Before you know it, skin is wrinkled, teeth are falling like your health.
And what to do and where to turn and who to blame and where to go.
You feel the demons pulling at your body, you might as well let go.

Fire baby, don't you know who we are.
Fire baby, bye bye bye bye boy.
Fire baby, don't you know where you are.
Fire baby, bye bye bye bye boy.

Fire baby, don't you know who we are.
Fire baby, bye bye bye bye boy.
Fire baby, don't you know where you are.
Fire baby, bye bye bye bye boy.
