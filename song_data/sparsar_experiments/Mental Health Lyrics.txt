Mental Health Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

I was a child.
It's a strange thought.
Where is it going?
In the trees it looks like bees to float around like that;.
Like part of the rest of the thing, not looking for entertainment.
Don't worry if what you say is a quote from older days.
When in doubt, just look it up.
Or when in real doubt, look around you and stop crying.
Stop crying.

Better to let them know sooner than later.
Like you've never rolled down a window in your whole life.
Do you remember the start, where it all came down?

We aren't looking for entertainment to forgive your parents.
You are normal and healthy to forgive yourself.
