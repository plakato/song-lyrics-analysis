Freak Ya Down 2 Da Bass Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.

Yeah, we very different that I can't deny 
Yous a big city, girl and imma country guy 
You represent the north, so you love hip-, hop 
And, im straight up out the south, so imma bout that drop 
But lets get real for a minute baby. Look at my face: 
And tell me: have you ever been queen to bass? 
So has a man ever made. You buckle up at your knees, 
By the way he slowly ate your macorronni and cheese 
If. Not then, I suggest we go under my suite 
Get a knock and ill, none of talking and turn back my sheets 
Get a radio and put one one of C.C.s beats. 
Then lay your body down as I proceed to breed 
And eat your body like potatoe, salad and ham, 
Kissing on the nipples on your candied yams 
Squeezing, my whipped cream on your lemon meraing 
Bass music. In the back saturating, your brain 
To. Have you moaning screaming swanging and kicking 
Beggin for a piece of this Kentucky fried chicken 
Freaking you to the bass and fulfilling your dream? 
And me say: you know the body with the southern cousine c.mon 
 
Let me freak ya, down 2 da bass, baby 
Let me freak you down to the bass.X4 
 
I know you made love on satin sheets 
But. Have you ever did it in a chevy Capri? 
Drop top by the lake skin to skin 
With bass, music, pumpin out your 12.s and 10.s 
Body.s full of sweat like we diggin a ditch 
The whole car rocking, like we hittin a switch 
Tricking on the way that I slowly lick, 
Your body up and down. Like a chick-o stick 
Cuz when it come to getting freaky there.s, no one greater 
I freak. Some now then save some for later 
So stop playing hard to get and come chill. 
With this country bro from outa Jacksonville 
So. I can mix my rice with your lima beans, 
Drop my ham, hogs, and see your mustard greens 
And turn you O.U.T. in my B.E.D, then wash it all down with a glass of sweet
tea 
And everything I love imma freak ya. Well, 
Tapping on your ears, like a S.P. 12 
Taking, your hip- hop and enhancing the taste 
By, adding just a pinch of this country, fried bass, c.mon 
 
Let me freak ya, down 2 da bass, baby 
Let me freak you down to the bass X4 
 
If. You, let me stir your body like a bowl of soup, 
Then ill be softer than the leather in a lexus coupe 
Make you wetter than a beach when the tide is high. 
And have your body feeling sweeter than some pecan pie. 
You.Ll be riding cloud 9. When you flying a plane 
Higher than a junkie on some crack cocaine 
Happier than a kid playing ball in the park, 
And crawling up the wall like a roach in the dark 
Ill, be livin in your body like its Sunday brunch 
Swallowing, your sweat, like its tropical Punch 
Patiently im waiting on the chance to hunch 
Like im waiting on the check around the first of the month. 
Ill spray, your body down in some C.K.B 
And, lay it down like im, Eightball and MJG 
Go and watch braid. Her turn some tricks, 
Like im chris watch and nelson and you vanity 6 
Investigating, your body like the Rockford files 
Stabbing like the dagger from the golden child, 
Making love together, kinda, nice and slow 
To, a bass, grave beeper have some alga mo 
Ill lick your lolly Pop till the candy gone 
Till im singing mo tired than a brandy song 
Sticking to your body like its lesses paste 
And. Have you screaming yeah boy, I, like you, flava flave 
Trying, to win your price like the price? Is right, 
Singing in your ear, like im, brian mcknight 
All night long like the two man band 
And ride up in them sheets like the Ku Klux Klan 
 
Let me freak you down to the bass baby 
Let me freak you down to the bass.until fade
