Umbrage (She Was The First...) Lyrics
by Swing Dee Diablo.

I Understand that you were the first.

First Verse.

Sometimes life deals you an crazy hand.
Like when I fell in love with you.
And I became your Man.
I was mesmerized by your body and face.
I didn't realize that evils were slowly taking place.
Like The thought of you.
Being pregnant with his kid.
Kinda got me feeling like.
I no longer want to live.
I should just kill my self right now were I stand.
But I'm Scared my mother and father.
Just wouldn't Understand.
In The long run.
Child support was worth more than my heart.
You had a nigga figured out.
From the very start.
The 1st time we kissed.
You tasted my blood and liked it.
Since that day I've been addicted.
I felt no need to fight it.
You Piss me off.
Then you want me to stroke your Kitty Cat.
I Throw You up.
Then I Hit it just like a baseball bat.
Chase the cat.
Automic Dog.
I'm trying to get away from that.
But Just like the Dark side.
You always seem to pull me back.
You cut me so deep with your words.
My momma can feel it.
I Know when somethings is wrong with you.
Cause your face will reveal it.
You blow your top.
You going off the top like a ceiling.
Everyday you cause me pain.
We needed time for the Healing.

Chorus.

I try to make you happy.
But that's when you acted worse.
You represent that word called LOVE.

Sometimes you act pure EVOL.
Let's make love in a hearse.
You were here before Eve.
You were the first.

Second Verse.

I'm glad we ain't go half on rent.
Never mind a baby.
You are out of your mind.
I'm starting to think your crazy.
Teeth in your Vagina.
Beautiful Disaster.
We make love twice a day.
You just hoping I Die faster.

Chorus.

I try to make you happy.
But that's when you acted worse.
You represent that word called LOVE.

Sometimes you act pure EVOL.
Let's make love in a hearse.
You were here before Eve.
You were the first.
