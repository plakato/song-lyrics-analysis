Prey Lyrics
by Swing Dee Diablo.


I'm a Sacrifice.
I'm The Blood on a Rusty Knife.
You're The Demon.
I'm The Entity That Gave You Life.
I Run With A Crew That Only Works At Night.
Except For The Angel.
But He's The Angel of Death.
Ni$#a Get It Right.
You're Outta My Mind.
So You Outta Sight.
In My Pipe.
There's Nothing but Kush.
That Keeps Me Flying High Like Kites.
Barack Obama's a Muslim.
Yeah-5 Percent.
My Commissary's On Full.
Yours Is That Indigent.
Your soul i'm selling it.
At Dixieland for 60 Cents.
Smell The Mustard Gas As It Seeps.
Up Out The Vents.
I Use Chlorine As A Dip For My Doritos Chips.
I Serve Road Kill On A Bun.
But That Ain't Ketchup Bitch!
Aliens Say My Name When They Worship God.
The World Doesn't Exist.
It's Just An Elaborate Facade.
I Got A Pet Goat.
I Nicknamed Him Todd.
And He'll Die At The Same Time.
The Knife Enters The Virgins Bod.

When Blue Skies Turn Grey.
The Clouds Go Away.
I Guess There's Nothing Left To Say.
You Better Prey.
When Babies Are Born Dead.
Ni$#a Shot In They Heads.
Come On Let's Paint The Town Red.
You Better Prey.
People Losing They Homes.
Gas Prices Alone.
Will Make You Blow Off Your Mother Fucking Dome.
You Better Prey.
If You See A Ni$#a Like Swing Dee.
Coming Your Way.
Better Move My Ni$#a.
Or You Will Become Prey.

A-Yo.
I'm Walking Death.
Evil is Just One of My Traits.
I'll Throw a Rat In A Bag.
I Call It Shake N Bake.
I Drink Rubbing Alcohol.
But I Mix It With Pepsi.
Pop a Pill Go To Hell.
And Dance With Elvis Presley.
I See Biggie Smalls In My Sleep.
He Told Me To Ride.
On All Of These How Ass Ni$#a.
Because they Rhymes Are Weak.
I'll Take This Pencil I'm Using.
And Stab You In Your Cheek.
It'll Make It Damn Near Impossible.
For Your Ass To Speak.
I'm Eddie Murphy ,Esham ,and ICP Mixed Together.
If You're Familiar Then you Know That I Control The Weather.
If I Ain't there,Then It Ain't A Party.
It's Boring Dude.
But If I'm There Then You Hate Me.
Cause I Eat All The Food.
I'm Ravishing, Ain't I Rick?
Most Of The Time I'm Rude.
The Nature Boy, Ain't I Rick?
With Flare and Attitude.
This Is The W.W.E.
World Wide Evil.
Cults Play My Songs When They Want To Deceive You.

I'm A Dangerous Disaster.
Leaving Your Head Plastered.
Split,Bloody on The Street.
Swerve,Turn On Your Hazards.
I'm Your Master.
Let's Dance Around The Bond Fire.
My Desire's To Fuck In Dunz Tomb.
I Need The Room.
To Conjure Up The Spirit Of A Witch.
Then Hit That Shit.
Til The Green Bitch Trip.
And cast a Spell On My Dick.
Real Quick,Look In The Mirror.
There's No Reflection.
You've Won The Night Breed Election.
Now Who You Respecting.
I Was Eleven The First Time I Craved Blood.
Little Girls I Shoved.
Eating Up They Pies Of Mud.
I From The State.
Where The Water Surrounds Us.
Just To Drowned Us.
The People Closest To Us.
Are The Ones Who Want To Down Us.
It's Hell That I've Been Through.
So To Hell I'm a Send You.
Don'T Make Me Step Up.
And Cut Your Ass Like A Ginsu.
This Is The W.W.E.
World Wide Evil.
Cults Play My Songs When They Want To Deceive You.
