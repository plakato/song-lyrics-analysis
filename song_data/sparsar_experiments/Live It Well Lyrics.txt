Live It Well Lyrics
by Switchfoot.


Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Take the burden from my arms.
Take the anchors off my lungs.
Take me broken and make me one.
Break the silence and make it a song.

Life is short; I wanna live it well.
One life, one story to tell.
Life is short; I wanna live it well.
And you're the one I'm living for.
Awaken all my soul.
Every breath that you take is a miracle.
Life is short; I wanna live it well, yeah.

I wanna sing with all my heart a lifelong song.
Even if some notes come out right and some come out wrong.
Cause I can't take none of that through the door.
Yeah, I'm living for more than just a funeral.
I wanna burn brighter than the dawn.

Life is short; I wanna live it well.
One life, one story to tell.
Life is short; I wanna live it well.
And you're the one I'm living for.
Awaken all my soul.
Every breath that you take is a miracle.
Life is short; I wanna live it well, yeah.

I got one life and one love.
I got one voice, but maybe that's enough.
Cause with one heartbeat and two hands to give.
I got one shot and one life to live.
One life to live, yeah.
And every breath you take is a miracle.

Life is short; I wanna live it well.
One life, one story to tell.
Life is short; I wanna live it well.
And you're the one I'm living for.
Awaken all my soul.
Every breath that you take is a miracle.
Life is short; I wanna live it well.
And you're the one I'm living for.

One life, one love.
One life, one love.
One voice, yeah.
And that's enough, oh.

I got one shot and one life to live, one life to live.
