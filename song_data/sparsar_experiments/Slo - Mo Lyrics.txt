Slo - Mo Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

Stop. Pause. Take a minute.
Let this bring you back to a place that you remember.
We were young, cool, naive.
Hair was blowing backwards the California breeze.
I was smiling back at you as you were looking back at me.
Driving Santa Monica your hand upon my knee.
And I was kissing you.
Wasn't missing you.
Do you remember too.

I remember talking in the dark.
Until we saw the sunlight.
Girl we had a spark.
We let go.
Underneath the stars.
Drinking up the moon light.
Taking our time.
Living in slow motion.
\- slow motion.
Didn't learn the lessons that they taught us back in school.
Fell in love with taking chances so we broke all of the rules.
And I never knew the meaning of, â€žI've got something to lose.
Till I lost you, I lost you.

So come on baby.
Let's take a slow rude to living a good life.
Don't say maybe.
We'll take our time.

Talking in the dark.
Until we see the sunlight.
Girl we have a spark.
So let's go.
Underneath the stars.
Drinking up the moonlight.
Taking our time.
Living in slow motion.
\- slow motion.
I still thing about you and all our memories.
Late night dancing to that Marvin Gaye.
First time, back seat, Chevrolet.
So can we live it, can we live it again.
So pack your bags for a getaway.
We take a trip back to our hideaway.
Keep it old fashioned on the modern day.
4x So can we live it.
In slow motion.

Talking in the dark.
Until we see the sunlight.
Girl we have a spark.
So let's go.
Underneath the stars.
Drinking up the moonlight.
Taking our time.
Living in slow motion.
\- slow motion.
