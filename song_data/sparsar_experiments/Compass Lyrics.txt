Compass Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

I just want something to believe in.
Bigger than you and me.
I just want something to believe in.
Bigger than you and me.
Don't want to turn away.
Look where the time went.
Don't leave yourself in this day.
Where was the time spent.

Cause a compass is the call.
You don't even know what it's for.
Look to the eye of the storm, you're in it.
Cause a compass is the call.
You don't even know what it's for.
Look to the eye of the storm, you're in it.

Only time won't destroy.
The skin we're in.
And leave us all.
Until we begin again.
Every day, every night, all the time I wonder.
To the end of the line will it finish now?

Cause a compass is the call.
You don't even know what it's for.
Look to the eye of the storm, you're in it.
Cause a compass is the call.
You don't even know what it's for.
Look to the eye of the storm, you're in it.

Don't wash your time away.
Don't wash your time away.
Don't wash your time away.
I just want something to believe in.
Bigger than you and me.
I just want something to believe in.
Bigger than you and me.

Cause a compass is the call.
You don't even know what it's for.
Look to the eye of the storm, you're in it.
Cause a compass is the call.
You don't even know what it's for.
