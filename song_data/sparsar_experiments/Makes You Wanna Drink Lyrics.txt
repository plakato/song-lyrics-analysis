Makes You Wanna Drink Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Now there's something 'bout when the weather gets warm.
The bluebirds singing and the honeybees swarm.
Girls are wearin' the daisy dukes.
And I'm rockin' flip flops stead of cowboy boots.

So damn packed you gotta park it in the ditch.
Jams start pumpin' out the stereo.
Bass drum buckin' like a rodeo.

Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
On a riverbank.
Got the 'Bama cranked.
Makes you wanna drink, don't it.

Now when the dogwoods bloom and the grass gets green.
The catfish makin' them Zebco sing.
Monday morning is out of sight.
We all get little thirsty on Friday night.

Hey girl, won't you hold me tight.
My hands so cold from diggin' in the ice.
I got a case of Busch light.
You want one, alright.

Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
On a riverbank.
Got the skynrd cranked.
Makes you wanna drink, don't it.

Get your hands up.
If you're pickin' up what I'm Puttin' down.
Get your hands up.
If you want me to buy you another round a.
Get your hands up.
If your whiskey bent and hell bound.
Get your hands up.
If you like the way that guitar sounds.

Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
On a riverbank.
Got Bocephus cranked.

Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
On a riverbank.
Got that country cranked up.
Makes you wanna drink, don't it.
