Bad Dreams Lyrics
by Swollen Members.

Prevail.
In the beginning all I hear is people singing.
Deep and low with iron bells ringing.
And there's a source of heat near my feet.
Im so weak I pass in and out of sleep.
Flashes of light blotches of colour.
I yell out for help but its drown out by weather.
Downpour torrential power of the vengeful.
This was all triggered by the subconscious central.
Sweet dreams are hideous lets not confuse those.
Bad dreams will find you confine you to circles.
Every other movement is slowed by your mind.
That's why stabbing them blind is no crime.
With no REM. your bound to cave in.
And life in the conscious life is quite grim.
If I can't escape than I'll die in my sleep.
Cause the cliff is too steep and the water's too deep.

Mad Child &amp; Prevail.

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya.
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya.
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear.
You don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear.
You don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad Dreams.
You don't want to have to wake up here.

Mad Child:.
Im running down a hall with one wall of flames.
With friends I've never seen in my life with strange names.
Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya.
Pains not what it seems cold stares and sudden screams.
I get in fights every night as im reflecting.
Throwing punches fast hard as I can but not connecting.
There protected by a force field locked in an engagement.
Until I see the colour red when pounding heads into the pavement.
Caught up in a chase scene or working on a plan.
Sometimes im falling and I have to wake up before I land.
Lots of doors to open afraid what I might find.
My girlfriend getting fucked with eight more guys in line.
Can't wait to rise and shine when ill thoughts are provoked.
My girlfriends right beside me getting choked.
In real life plus I heard it could get worse.
So much for walking in my sleep that's close to murder in the first.

Mad Child &amp; Prevail.

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya.
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya.
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear.
You don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear.
You don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad Dreams.
You don't want to have to wake up here.

Prevail.
They say that most people can only dream in black and white.
That's why he packs a knife and only reappears at night.
I pray for the light to turn him back to stone.
And shine bright enough so I can find my way home.

Mad Child.
Watching myself from above and just behind.
Like im controlling video games inside my mind.
Be careful what you dream for because its right there.
Sometimes day dreams turn into nightmares.

Prevail.
I've prepared the chair.
Electricity rumbles through the air.
You don't want to have to wake up here.
Its cold in the morning.
Breath the eternal frost of our dawning.

Mad Child.
Plus it's dark and damp.
With slight hints of death.
So cold I'm spitting icicles.
Rip right through the flesh.
Smoke forms with every breath.
The sound of children screaming.
Pinch my self I have to wake up.
Afraid of dreaming.

Mad Child &amp; Prevail.

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya.
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya.
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear.
You don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear.
You don't want to have to wake up here.
Bad Dreams.
You don't want to have to wake up here.
