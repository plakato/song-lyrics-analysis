Carry you - cutmore remix Lyrics
by Union J.

George.
Dont ever say you're lonely.
Just lay your problems on me.
And i'll be waiting there for you.
The stars can be so blinding.
When you get tired of fighting.
You know the one you can look to.
Jaymi.
When the vision you have gets blurry.
You dont have to worry, I'll be your eyes.
It's the least I can do, cause when I fell, you pulled me through.
So you know that.
All.
I'll carry you, I'll carry you, I'll carry you.
So you know that.
I'll carry you, I'll carry you, I'll carry you.
Josh.
I know it's been a long night, but now im here it's alright.
I've done my walking in your shoes.
JJ.
We'll take each step together, til you come back to center.
You know that I know the real you.
George.
And when the vision you have gets blurry.
You dont have to worry, I'll be your eyes.
Jaymi.
That's the least I can do, cause when I fell, you pulled me through.
So you know that.
All.
I'll carry you, I'll carry you, I'll carry you.
So you know that.
I'll carry you, I'll carry you, I'll carry you.
Josh.
Like you've been running for hours and can't catch your breath.
The demons are screaming so loud in your head.
Jaymi.
You're tired you're broken you're cut and you're bruised.
But nothing's too heavy just hold on, I'll carry you.
I'll carry you.
instrumental.
All.
So you know that.
I'll carry you, I'll carry you, I'll carry you.
So you know that.
I'll carry you, I'll carry you, I'll carry you.
So you know that.
I'll carry you, I'll carry you, I'll carry you.
