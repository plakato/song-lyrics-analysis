NGM Lyrics
by World's Fair.


I lost twenty pounds, I'm sexy bitch.
Workin' out, I'm flexin' bitch.
I'm the lion king, got the nine ring.
Got the sun god on my necklace bitch.
This jungle can't hold me, my OG's done told me.
These streets done mold me, I'm still ridin' around with my homies.
And I'm too thug for these hipsters, too hipster for these thug niggas.
For the black girls in Jimmy Choo's and the white girls who love niggas.
But I still hate the police, still hate my landlord.
Still rock that town and that same ol' shit I stand for.

Never gonna make it x12.
Ya never gonna make it x6.

I'm prepared to save it like I'm worthless.
Hit a shit ball on purpose, hit a bitch off.
With a link on tell her get lost she get nervous.
I blame my like for words on the surface.
I'll bite your neck so you know what ?
The L on the weekends, you know never workin'.
On my nigga Abel with those shitty curtains.
He said I'm never gonna get it.
Never gonna get it.
You mean, ol' Nigel who had braces and who was bad at datin'.
Three XE's and matching laces, that was pretty tasteless.
The man named Georgie on his rider, he forever wasted.

Never gonna make it x12.
Ya never gonna make it x6.

This your party?
We at your party, screamin' Fuck yo party!
We about to crash this bitch, we weren't even invited.
So with that being said, don't be surprised when we rush the entrance.
Smelling like Hennessey and nugs of that potent substance.
We on another level sonically.
Don't nobody sound like us but the masses still wanna sleep on we.
Like a brand new mattress 'til we wake they ass up.
With pot and pans like some tireless.
Snatch ? like some burglas.
Who the fuck want to rump with us?
