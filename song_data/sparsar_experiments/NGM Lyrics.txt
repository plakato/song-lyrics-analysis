NGM Lyrics
by World's Fair.


I lost twenty pounds: I'm sexy bitch 
Workin' out, I'm flexin' bitch 
I'm the lion king got the nine ring, 
Got the sun, god on my necklace, bitch 
This jungle can't hold me. My OG's done told me 
These streets done mold me, I'm still ridin' around with my homies 
And, I'm too thug for these hipsters too hipster for these thug niggas 
For, the black girls in Jimmy Choo's and the white girls who love niggas 
But. I still hate the police still hate my landlord 
Still rock that town and that same ol' shit. I stand for 
 
Never gon na make it x12 
Ya. Never gon na make it x6 
 
I'm prepared to save it like I'm worthless. 
Hit. A shit ball on purpose, hit a bitch off 
With a link on tell her get lost. She get nervous. 
I blame my like for words on the surface. 
I'Ll bite your neck. So you know what 
The L on the weekends you know never workin' 
On, my nigga Abel with those shitty curtains 
He said I'm never gon na get it 
Never gon na get it 
You mean ol' Nigel who had braces and who was bad at datin', 
Three, XE's And matching laces that was pretty tasteless. 
The man named Georgie on his rider. He forever wasted 
 
Never gon na make it x12 
Ya. Never gon na make it x6 
 
This your party 
We at your party, screamin' Fuck yo party, 
We, about to crash this bitch. We weren't even invited 
So with that being said, don't be surprised when we rush the entrance 
Smelling like Hennessey and nugs of that potent substance 
We on another level, sonically 
Don't, nobody sound like us, but the masses still wan na sleep on we 
Like a brand new Mattress'Til we wake they ass up, 
With pot and pans like some tireless 
Snatch, like some burglas 
Who. The fuck want to rump with us
