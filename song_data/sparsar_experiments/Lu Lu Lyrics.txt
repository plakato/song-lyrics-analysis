Lu Lu Lyrics
by Univore.

It's not that easy to not think about you.
It's even harder to be here without you.
You're my secret, my secret girl.
The one I feel who can be in my world.

Lu Lu, you're my secret girl.
Everything I think of is about you.
It's all about you.

I know things about you.

I'm in disguise when I try to meet you.
I forget it all just to be beside you.
You're my secret, my secret girl.
My only vice, I can't shake you.

I know things about you.

This is the last time that I will see you.
We've come to far and now I must neglect you.
You're my secret, my secret girl.
I need to see what I'd be without you.
