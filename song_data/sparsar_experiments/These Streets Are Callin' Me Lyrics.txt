These Streets Are Callin' Me Lyrics
by Woodie.

My momma always told me it was gonna be days like this like this.

Woodie.
I live a lifestyle, covered up by dark clouds.
Dealin' with these suckas, but they only seem to bark loud.
Still I keep a strap for when I come across a killa.
I dreamt the day I'll have to fight that killa in the mirror.
I wake up every mornin', hit my fifth and hope I live.
Just another day to see what tomorrow's got to give.
I'm addicted to the liquor.
And at days I peel the sticker off another 40 ounce.
And wonder, How did my life get here?
My ole goes in stayin' drunk and eliminatin' funk.
Fuckin' hoes or rollin' triple golds always up in the trunk.
My mother asks me everyday, Are you still bangin?
I lie and tell her, No, but her heart knows I ain't changed none.
I hate to see her cry, wipe the tears from her eyes.
And try to tell her everything is gonna be alright.
I hug her tightly, as I leave it bothers me.
But for now I gotta go, cuz these streets are callin' me.

My mother prays that I quit the life I lead.
Damn I try to change my ways, but these streets are callin' me.
And I love her to death, but at the same time I'm a souljah.
I gotta put in work, let rivals know they can't get over.

Woodie.
I'm a yoc influenced souljah taking chances.
I'm levelin' with all my homeboys up in drug induced trances.
Evil dances through our thoughts as we plot different strategies.
To kill our enemies and not get caught.
My homie got shot in the spine, he's been paralyzed.
I see nothin' but deep despair when I stare into his eyes.
I feel my anger rise as I think about his character.
He never hurt nobody, just a homeboy that was there for ya.
These streets are really fair, and that's a hard lesson learned.
But you realize quick enough after up three time getting burned.
The streets are cold, bits of love but mostly greed is all they hold.
You in my way, I'll burn a load and make yo head explode, Now what.
That's my moto.
Livin' in the bottle, hit the throttle.
Let this shit start to get you thick, break out the fully-auto scrap killa.

Woodie.
Just got done.
Creasin' up my khakis, put my NIKES on.
I hear my homeboys outside honkin' the horn.
I guess tonight's on.
Grabbed the tray snubby.
Give my moms a kiss goodbye.
As I hop into the ride.
She prays that I come home alive.
I can't justify my life because I know I'm livin' wrong.
What the fuck do you expect me to do when the funk is on.
Tryin' to get along, with my rivals.
Foo, you must be jokin'.
What you smokin?
Hollow tips and pistols clips is what I got for fools approachin'.
I'm tryin' to get ahead.
Spitin' high-lead at these rivals ramped up.
In this life of vega got me homicidal.
Better check my vital signs.
Since I'm livin half dead by the thoughts.
Got my brain washed, fuckin' with my head.
Break a sweat up in my bed.
Dude, the nightmares got my body tense.
But still I'm prepared to die for this so called nonsense.
Cuz everything is fucked up.
The whole world is corrupt.
I'll never switch up on my homies.
So consider me stuck, fucked.
I ain't trippin' though.
Yeah my money's sittin' low.
But still I got enough to get a four-0 at the liquor store.
And clothes on my back, plus a gat for these rivals.
All my only necessities for survival.
