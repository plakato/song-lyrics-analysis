Boom Bye Bye Lyrics
by VI Seconds.


The Gangsta singing.

Boom Boom Bye Bye, Bye Bye, Bye Bye, Bye Bye Bye Bye.
Boom Boom Bye Bye, Bye Bye, Bye Bye, Bye Bye Bye Bye.
Boom Boom Bye Bye, Bye Bye, Bye Bye, Bye Bye Bye Bye.
Boom Boom Bye Bye, Bye Bye, Bye Bye, Bye Bye Bye Bye.

It was just a matter of time.
'til I would stand and start getting my stripes.
You're gonna give me what's mine.
Don't say you're not ready, I gave you your time.
I got my niggas in line.
Down for whatever once I wave that sign.
I'll give you all until nine.
To pay what you owe me.

Then I'm at your door.
I've taken interest and taking more.
Make it easy for yourself because I've run out of patience.
I don't hesitate when I'm taking my payments.
Bad mon if I'm holding a grudge and I choose to open arms better hope it's a.
hug.
If not, you're gonna see a whole new side.
So much metal on your whip, it's a whole new ride.
Gunshot! Gunshot! For your ross, playing with my paper it don't matter the.
cost.
Gunshot! Gunshot! For you fake niggas breaking the trust that's the reason why.
I hate niggas.
Gunshot! Gunshot! Where the crown at?
Gunshot! Gunshot! Where the chicken at?
Gunshot! Anywhere that you clowns at.
Gunshot! For the chicken nigga now we singing.

They always say to watch out for the quiet ones.
Cause they'll be the ones to tell you when your time is up.
Well I kept my mouth shut for a couple of years.
Now I'm out and howling getting paid by the punch this year.
From a city where niggas starve or get recognized.
Where there's two major things you should never set aside.
Your word and your balls and I hold mine with pride.
So much niggas can't even look me in the eyes.
I put fear in them cause there ain't a smidgen of real in them.

Life changing, people took notice on how I switched up.
Gasping, so much that they got the hiccups.
Now it's.
Gunshot! Gunshot! At any moment I'm killing these niggas, send my condolence.
Gunshots! Gunshots! In the air, for every little nigga finally making his.
career.
Gunshot! Gunshot! Where the money at?
Gunshot! Gunshot! For you funny acts.
Bang Bang! I'm living like Mick Foley.
The Cactus Jack gets gunshot by the police.
