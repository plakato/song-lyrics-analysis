Afternoon High Lyrics
by A-ha.

Ah, the sunlight hits the corner of your eye.
As it bounces off the morning sky.
The summer in the seventies fly by, bye.

Ah, daylight hits the corners of your mind.
Steals the thought you thought no one could find.
Close your eyes, and it will rob you blind, blind.

Ah.
Incidental memories collide.
Ah.
Sentimental reveries abide.
Afternoon high.

Ah, daylight hits the corners of your mouth.
Steals the words that filled you up with doubt.
Open up and let them all fall out, out.

Ah, honey smoothes the wrinkles from your bed.
Gone are the indentations of your head.
Leaving just the frown upon your forehead, head.

Ah.
Incidental memories collide.
Ah.
Sentimental reveries abide.
Afternoon high.

Ah.
Worry works a wrinkle over time.
Ah.
Open eyes and let it rob you blind.
Ah.
Incidental memories collide.
Ah.
People tell me you've been blinded by.
On afternoon high.
On afternoon high.
On afternoon high.
On afternoon high.
