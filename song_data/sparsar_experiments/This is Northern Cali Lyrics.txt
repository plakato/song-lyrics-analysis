This is Northern Cali Lyrics
by Woodie.

Woodie.
Enter my danger zone Northern Cali.
Yes son from the valley to the bay.
The mighty Norte got it sewn.
We bout half a mill' people up in these streets.
So keep a grip yeah we flared up we red flags and caps.
This ain't Blood or Crip.
this is northern organized raza till eternity.
Putting dips up in this mutha fucker stack and murder piece.
Never heard of Woodie now you have listen up and soak it in.
Northern Cali is full of killas homie go and tell a friend.
And if Fallen trail of nuds trail methamphetamine is good.

We gon raise the roof we pop our collars grip our nuts.
Kill our enemies' visions and feed fishes there guts.
Heavier in the old school Cuttys Larks N Malibu's.
350 rockers 450.
We got the now 916 N THE 209.
661 and 559 on the valley grind.
We got the 415 West Bay.
707 North Bay 408 South Bay.
But its all Norte.
The 510 of east bay 925.
East Co Co.
The Northern Cali breakdown for you po-po's.

This is Northern Cali representing putting it down.
We from the valley everybody holla your town.
We from the bay we all HANDLE the shit the same way.
From the valley to the bay ready for some gun play.

Woodie.
Homie we slang and we bang in east bay it's a G thing.
Punks saying salutation while taking lives with no delay.
Feel me its west coast the left coast no test wit killer Cali.
Nasty flashes  through your back streets and alleys.
Past the valley acting badly.
I hits the carry a fifth of brandy.
Splash these bitches cuz there trashy.
Rolling old school flows.
Valley cougars larks that park cut thangs and mustangs.
But one thing there's gun play.
So when the fucks bring.
Let your nuts swang.
It's a mustang for the no repore make you levitate regulate.
Po-po's got to bring the yellow tape in everyday.
Up here our tapes will set your hood now.
You can hear the evidence we represent put it down.
For the whole bay is a cold game.
And it all while cursing city streets.
These addicts smashing traffic on that cradik.
In the A-N-T-I-O-C-H we don't be hate.
We fo da pay and blowing brains.
I'm smoking dank  in my corner of the golden state.

When you smoking on the bubonic chronic that got you gone.
Where you think it come from.
Where you think it come from when you smoking.
On the bubonic chronic that got you gone.
Were you think it come from.
Where you think it come from.

Woodie.
It comes from northern Cali.
Up in home bock county.
the northwest region.
By the ocean not the valley.
It's considered the most ronic California commodity.
The hommies call it puff or balm.
The hippies call it pot or weed.
It's garneted to get you high tho O fo sho.
And the Northerners are making a killing slanging that roach.
But straight fo yayo packing pistols illegal substances distributed.
Got domies packing crystals and glass pipes and feel good again.
It gets dirty in this west coast sunshiny state.
You might die early gangbanging.
But that is the chance you take.
Locked up in prison for life.
1 2 3 strikes your out.
Sell a pound pack a pistol.
Shot a rival oh no doubt.
Wit no hesitation the judge will have you facing a life long vacation.
But we still regulation.
And these suckers APPROACHING and get treated like sluts.
This is northern cal bow down lick on these nuts.
