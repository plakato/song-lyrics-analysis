Betrayed Lyrics
by Wordsworth.

Feat. Skeematics.

Feeling betrayed by the things you do.
I don't give a fuck who you are, I'm superstar.
Flying through the airways high.
Don't give a damn I'll live it or die.

Feeling betrayed by the things you do.
I don't give a fuck who you are, I'm superstar.
Flying through the airways high.
Don't give a damn I'll live it or die.

Being successful is course and a gift.
People swear that they know me on a personal tip.
My close friends are amongst the first persons to flip.
Want my life.
Probably wishing at birth we were switched.
That person was Nick.
And find my parents, said not to talk to strangers.
Keep out of danger in the X-Man and Power Rangers.
Transformers at nine.
Was at obvious at that time.
Daddy stole my Optimus Prime.
Subtle signs that I notice as grown man.
I'm zoning and honing on moments should know was omens.
Could have known when I'm alone and doing radio he's not.
There that's when all the haters would phone in.
Stardom will always stark them.
Until you start to starve them.

That's when they wanna be best friends.
Fake friends at the wedding wonna be best men, pretend.

Yesterday I court my lady in lies.
My lady denies.
The question if the baby is mine.
I swore, that I'd stick around till the baby arrives.
Snooping around like a ninja in some crazy disguise.
But these Nike's ain't my shoe size.
In the mirror saying that she want's a bigger boob size.
Contacts and a new ride.
Disagreeing got me being two timed.
Found condoms.
We ain't used them ever since she got her tube sided.
See us park a lot.
Fretting like she park to shop.
A green Jeep pulled up next to her.
In the parking spot.
My heart had dropped.
Once I saw the doors, on the car was locked.
Saw the car start to rock, of course it was hard to watch.
She had other lovers before.
Don't my son to discover his mother.
Is undercover a whore.
She's sleeping with the brother in law.
I'm creeping with the sister to settle the score.
It's just the luck of the draw, betrayed.

Deception can be fatal.
Your buys waving weapons to persuasive you.
For the safe combination or the spray you.
In E.R. naked on the table with some seconds.
Just to save you a reflection.
In portrayel of betrayel.
When your recording the jam you call me.
But the court you on cam.
Taking out of hand damn you was fam.
So who your calling your man.
I ask those once you pass.
Don't put gas in your coroners van, betrayed.
