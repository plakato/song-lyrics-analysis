You Said The Words Lyrics
by Wood.

You said the words.
And I felt myself begin to fall.
And I saw the road ahead with moonlight at all.
And baby, baby, babe.
And I won't be home for tea.
Don't suppose you wanna see.
You said the words.
I felt the feeling in my heart.
And I saw my world just fall apart.
Baby, baby, babe.
And I won't be home for tea.
Don't suppose you wanna see.
