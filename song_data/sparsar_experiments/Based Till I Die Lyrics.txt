Based Till I Die Lyrics
by Yung God.


I hear the people talking but most of them never did this.
If you ain't talking business then get up out my business.
I fly so high I don't follow the rules of physics.
I'm achieving all my wishes bitch nigga I'm out here getting it.
I tell them suck my dick cause they don't like nothing that's different.
If you niggas keep hating I swear to God I'll fuck your bitches.
Pussy ass doctors could have sworn I needed Ritalin.
Cause I'm moving so fast a million thoughts how to get this cash.

I'm posted in the sky.
And I'll die before I lie.
And you can see it in my eyes.
Based world we on the rise.
Real niggas gone ride.
Fake niggas gone hide.
I'm based till I die.
I'm based till I die.

Pussy ass nigga I'm based till I die based till the grave.
Money on mind strapped twelve gauge.
Run up on me get flipped like a page.
Run up on me get flipped like a bitch in the bed.
Or a nigga get flipped like a switch.
You can call me toilet paper cause I'm on my shit.
Nigga I'm rich and I ain't got cash.
I don't give a fuck you can call me a ho or a fag.
Cause I still got swag M.O.E.
. everything means last.

I should have got seven eight nine ten eleven twelve years.
For the shit that I did in the past.
I ain't got to stop cause I stay on the D-lo.
Nine Glock cocked like the eyes on D-Bo.
Yung God I'll take your bitch like Nino.
And you know that I'll still be around like C-Lo.
Swag cost a kilo flow cost a brick.
Keep your mouth closed you ain't talkin bout shit.
Swag like a bitch dress like a bitch.
But thats on my dick best respect this bitch.
Swag like a bitch dress like a bitch.
But thats on my dick best respect this bitch.
Strapped like Plies nigga fuck your pride.
Tats on my face cause I'm based till I die.

I'm posted in the sky.
And I'll die before I lie.
And you can see it in my eyes.
Based world we on the rise.
Real niggas gone ride.
Fake niggas gone hide.
I'm based till I die.
I'm based till I die.
