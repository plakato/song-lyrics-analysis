Broken Glass Christening Lyrics
by Xasthur.

The lie is no escape, lost in the reflection's cycle and crying rape.
Fiends and sexual deviants hiding behind God at their own convenience.
Reach the realization, you're here because you've been thrown away.
From a broken glass christening to the recycling of broken mirrors.
The energy drained with the anger I instilled upon you.
Let me kill you, what do you have to lose?
