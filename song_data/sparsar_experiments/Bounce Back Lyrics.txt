Bounce Back Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


After the storm, After the rain.
After the morning, After the pain.
We gon...Bounce Back..Bounce Back..Bounce Back..Bounce Back.

Told me, It's a fire get out.
This the big one, I'm in the hood with the homies still hitting one.
I ain't going nowhere, Still struggling.
We on the block, fuck the game, still hustling.
I get my money from the streets stacking big papers.
I'm on the block strapped, Mane I'm ready for the haters.
Check the news mane, We don't move mane.
We in that Calliope Projects playing cool games.
I wanna bad bitch just like Trina.
Fuck around, came harder, came Katrina.
I got 'em shaking and baking, We getting paper like bacon.
They call us rapper G's, Mane why the media hating.
I'm so hood these hands so good.
Man I ain't leaving cause I'm stuck in the woods.
I'm living this thug life, Serve a bud light.
Used to riding on 24's with a chrome bite.

Now let me tell you we gon bounce back, bounce back.
I'm straight New Orleans like a bounce track, bounce track.
Now look lil' daddy we been bout that, bout that.
A moment of silence for everybody that lost it all.
You gon see that we gon get it how we living.
How we living is the realist whether in 'n out of prison.
I mean we keep it gutter people sweating gotta feel that pass.
Sack of dreads, twisting wrist blinging we in it mane.
My city under siege but believe we gon breathe.
It brings the dead like a book wrote by Steven King.
Its real life not a movie no second takes.
No saying cut just President saying heaven sakes.
I gotta tell it straight, We real as they gon come.
We not standing down, My city never done.
I gotta tell it straight, We real as they gon come.
My city not standing down, Mane we never done.
