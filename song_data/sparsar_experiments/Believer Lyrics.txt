Believer Lyrics
by Bizarre.


Make me a believer.

I want what I can see.
I want what I can see.
Just one thing to believe.
Just one thing to believe.
Make me a believer.
Make me a believer.

Look at the sky, it's raining outside.
But I got too much pride just to ask for a ride.
Hold my head high, never ask why.
Never ever, ever seen a grown man cry.
They took Bugz and they murdered P.
Sometimes I ask the lord why he ain't take me.
Sitting by the beach, staring at the ocean.
Kicking these raps that's full of emotion.
Suicidal thoughts going through my head.
Bizarre is alive, but Rufus has been dead.
I'm running out of time, I'm running out of rhymes.
Grab the tech cause I'm running out of nines.

And I believe that I'm gonna make it.
Don't ask for shit, man I just take it.
Detroit, Michigan, home of the broke dreams.
Abandoned houses, known crack fiends.
Man I'm on lean just to escape reality.
Im losing weight and I ain't counting no calories.
Ain't no salary, they done close down the plants.
Green failing parenting, I'm staying with my aunt.
Who gonna give me a ride? Who's gonna take me to school?
Who gonna help mama out when daddy acting a fool?
The D, watching my people get slaughtered.
Hurricane Katrina went out the water.
Who do you believe in, heaven or hell?
College or jail? Bed or a cell? Who got my bail?

Mom's steady sick and it's right to the point where I need her.
To be coherent cause Aaron's about to be blaring through speakers.
But it won't reach her when research feed her meds to get weaker.
How can the devil play her world when it's so beneath her.
Give and ye shall receive and yet she's the receiver.
Of seizures and fevers that's why I stay Ebenezer.
That's why you hear sorrowful messages through your tweeters.
Feeling my pain at my show in the front row and the bleachers.
God seek her please so she breathes deeper.
Not a preacher free be disease either.
On my knees for weeks hurry retrieve her.
Really need your deed to make me a believer.
