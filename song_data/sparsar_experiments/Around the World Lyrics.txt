Around the World Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.

Maybe what we need is just space to breathe.
Maybe we just need to take a step back and think this through.
Some might find it necessary while others find it challenging.
There's so many ways we can change, so many ways to see someone else's point.
of view.

All around the world.
Can't you see a day, everyone leaning the same way?
All you need is love.

We're blinded by fear and we hate our brother.
We don't understand his differences.
It's our ignorance that's a handicap waiting for a cure.

All around the world, we react the same way.
When you love it's like a flood.
All you need is love.

All around the world.
Love changes everything even in the smallest of ways.
All you need is love.

Day by day the veil is lifted and I release control.
All these changes, all this re arranging starts with me if I want more.
Love is all, all you need.

All you need.
All you need is love.
All around the world.
We all have the choice, speak in fear or make love your voice.

All you need is love.
Love is all you need.
All around the world, change begins with you, with everything you do.

All you need is love.
All around the world, it's time to stop the blame.
Only love heals the pain.
All you need is love.
