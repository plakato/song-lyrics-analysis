Dough Lyrics
by Ty.


Get yo' muthafuckin' mind right.
Get yo' muthafuckin' mind right.
Get yo' muthafuckin' mind right.
Free the BG, yeah, it's all on me.
Get yo' muthafuckin' mind right.

Bitches and niggas both know.
Before you step to the kid, you better head that dough.

Yo, look, and that shit just too real.
That's why I'm out there chasin' mills.
Do ya thang whether you smoke or pop pills.
Chill, show em hoes who's really real.
I'm a murderer and these beats I kill.
Man, whazam, I'm goin' hard in these bitch.
Do my raps while you applaud in this bitch.
And that money, oh, man, I gotta get it.
If I feel this a set-up then I ain't fuckin' with it.
My hustle come before these hoes, you already know.
Don't to the kid if you ain't got that dough.
If I fuck with you hard, you get it for the low.
Ready to blow, my clique, we ain't never see these hoes.
Couple racks fo' sure, designer shit on my clothes.
And the calls we pushin', we never afford blows.
On dangerous grounds, but they can offer a hand.
Ready to bake a blast, with someone cleanin' up now.

Got these hoes in line, that's tough niggas ?
Crib ?, crept on, I ain't lying.
Rapping and getting money at the same time.
You out your damn mind if you think it's all good.
For you to knock my hustle and nigga I wish you would.
Get your ass spanked like a child in the hood.
Let's get it understood.
If your bitch throw it at me Imma hit it good.
Nigga want the money and the power, fifteen every hour.
Used to show love until somebody played him sour.
Whole clique, some ridaz watching 'em outsiders.
Life ain't nothing but bitches and impalas.
My homie taught me that, ? just a rap.
Trappin' in the studio, how you trappin' a trap.
Real recognize real, fake niggas get killed.
Playing my position, nigga I'm bound to keep it trill.
