Bout To Get Fruit Punched
by The Wonder Years.


I was peddling sugary drinks to all the little kids for weeks, 
Spending late nights at the factory 
Making fat stacks for my family 
But. Now my wife's been getting shady 
That trick-ass mark, don't call me baby 
I'll sit by the window sill and if she's got another man, 
Then juice will spill 
 
Thought I had people. I could trust, like my boy, Captain Crunch 
I know he'd. Never do me like that, but behind my back, 
I found her mouth all cut up and his hat in the corner. 
Yo homes, you don't know what I'm capable of 
 
Before Kool-Aid picked me up. 
I ran blocks, I sold, rocks 
G's up hoes down and I'd have all these snitches stomped 
Then. I grew up. 
And got a real job peddling drinks to all these little snobs 
And. If you think that I fell off, 
Then watch your back before you get popped. 
 
Breakdown 
I'll disconnect the Captain's neck 
And make him wish that he was dead. 
I'Ll disconnect the Captain's neck 
And make him wish that he was dead. 
I'Ll smash your skull like a crunch-berry punk 
 
So keep my name out your mouth son
