BYOB Lyrics
by Yung Joc.

Yung Joc.
Joc Joc don't stop, oh my God you're so hot.
Catch me on yo' block with 4 Glocks and 4 shots.
Bet you niggas know not, try me like a ho not.
Niggas run in, kick the do', fuck a do' knock.
Gotta make the quarter, I mix it with the soda.
I chop the dope and sell it with the Razor Motorola.
Hold up 'fore I have to load up, hollow tips they explode up.
Leave you pussy niggas wet as chocha stankin with the odor.

Bring your own beer to the party - aight~!
Bring your own beer to the party - aight~!
Bring your own beer to the party motherfuckers.
Cause I heard you came to have a good time - aight~!
Alright, alright, alright, alright - ah let's go~!
Alright, alright, alright, alright - ah let's go~!
Alright, alright, alright, alright - ah let's go~!
Alright, alright, alright, alright - let's go motherfucker!

Yung Joc.
Yeahhhhhhhh.
Yung Joc so jiggy, Lear Jet to yo' city.
Monday night, Magic City, thunderstorm when I'm tippin.
Ice game, super nifty, super kush, two for fifty.
Fat boy yellin out, pop bottles 'til I'm tipsy.
I like my chick booty big-o, lay my head on them big ole's.
Put her on her tiptoes, I get up in the middle.
I don't wine them, dine them, or rest have 'em.
I'm the #1 playboy, I press play and.

Yung Joc.
Party like a rockstar, better yet, block bar.
Lighter to the ceiling, grab a beer, pop the top boi.
I.F. so clear, freezer burn both ears.
Elders say Oh dear when they hear I'm near.
Rubber burn first gear, platinum on my first year.
Wood on my sheer, put my wood all in her grill.
Roof on fire, sound the alarm.
We don't need water.

Yung Joc.
Ha ha, 5 4 3 2, R-2-D-2.
Let me see your robot, a little dance that we do.
Pyrite, no left, I'm hype, with no help.
On cloud 9 - heart racin like Corvette.
I need a material girl in a material world.
Give me slim on the backseat of my Imperial girl.
Go and show me what you work with, girl that's a perfect fit.
Hold up, stop, it hurts when you twist it.
