40 Days 40 Nights Lyrics
by Yung Joey.


40 days, 40 nights.
I make it rain like Jehovah nigga, Jesus Christ.
All I ever gave a fuck about was stunting.
All I ever gave a fuck about was stunting.
Just hit a lick, we blow it tonight.
Make it rain like Jehovah nigga, Jesus Christ.
All I ever gave a fuck about was stunting.
All I ever gave a fuck about was stunting.

All I ever gave a fuck about was stunting.
Fucking up racks with my niggas like it's nothing.
One thing about these bitches is I don't cuff 'em.
Cause these hoes man, they all want something.
Young nigga, ducking racks, chasing the cheddar.
These labels wanna sign me, they need a mill or better.
Talking dinner parties with label exec's who write checks.
And fly on private jets, call it changing the weather.
Some people say I changed, I say for the better.
Married to the money like we live together.
Flock boy ghoster make 'em feel better.
Suit got that Benz that will make you get your shit together.
Man the doors go up on that mo'fucker.
Make you hating ass niggas throw up in this motherfucker.
Throw your rent money, like fuck in this motherfucker.
Watch these hoes flock to me, like good luck in this motherfucker.

All I ever gave a fuck about stunting.
Paid in full like Lou-lou I be fronting.
You play with money, that's in the discussion.
No rice, no champagne, no nothing.
Gotta get it by any means, fuck you talking bout.
Like that crazy nigga that broke inside of Diddy's house.
I need an ounce in the Hamptons, born in the south.
Greeted by champagne, bad bitches, they titties out.
Some people love the fame, I just love the money.
? that will make the pretty bitch love me.
All my diamonds will make these pretty bitches wanna fuck me.
On my mama, my phone ringing, I'm still serving custers.
Wait, hold up, toast, pour up.
My bitch look like a bag of money, yours looking toe up.
Your career on the decline, my shit finna' blow up.
You got a show in your city, guess which hoes finna' show up.
