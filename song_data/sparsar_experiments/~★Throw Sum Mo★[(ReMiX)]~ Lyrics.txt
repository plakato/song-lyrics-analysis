~★Throw Sum Mo★[(ReMiX)]~ Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


Ass fat, yeah I know.
You just got cash? Blow some mo.
Blow sum mo, blow some mo.
The more you spend it, the fast it go.
Bad bitches, on the floor.
It's rainin hundred's, throw sum mo.
Throw some mo, throw some mo, throw some mo.

Hi, bye hater, I flood the club with paper.
Shorty got a ass, some for now, some for later.
Somethin like Nicki's, dancin like Maliah.
I'm throwin all this money, I'mma fuck around and buy her.
I can flick the money all night, til my wrist tired.
If you put in work, this the night you gon retire.
You a bad bitch, I ain't even gon deny her.
She told me, throw that money I said make it worth my while.
I'm bout to empty out the ATM.
She doin tricks that make a nigga wanna spend.
Girl, you know you got me fascinated.
Just keep on dancin' 'til I'm outta paper.

Franklin's rainin on your body.
Rainin on your body, rainin on your body.
Won't you do what I say, start rubbin on your body.
You like hundred's on your body, girl, you need to get naughty.
Hold up, hold on, her eyes on me, is that your ho?
If so I'mma get her fore the nights over.
DJ play my shit so I'm finna crank up off in the VIP zone.
See the money go up and she dance on sight.
By the end of the night she on endo.
Lemme see you make it clap on tempo.
Lemme see you get low like limbo.

Come in ho, mistletoe, I got birdies, crows.
Flip it a bit, wanna jump on the dick.
I'm like bool, let's get it, let's get it.
I got these bitches kissin on these bitches.
I can't even count 'em, I fuck by the digits.
Swag terrific, I might fuck that bitch in the kitchen.
Baby, don't use dirty dishes, or else you might whip up a BURRRR.
My neck, my wrists is a BURRRR.
She wanna fuck my dogs, I'm like, woof.
Panoramic roof, I drop the coupe,BOO!
Pulled up with a bitch, she look like New New.
It's okay if I lie to you, bitch, my swag's the truth.
Hey, she come right back, like em divers do.
Fifty thousand off fifty niggas, no caliber.

Step in, take everything relevant,don't care if you're benevolent.
Or you may never land well, it is clear and evident.
We roll in like the president, lock down the whole district.
Then steal every resident ,and given them democracy.
With the Axe that's sharp make sure that thing is permanent.
Have to get what I have to get , me don't care everything is hard to get.
I come take and then calculate , then do something immaculate.
Look pon de wall.
Check pon de right.
Listen to thunder.
Look at the lightn'ng.
We came here for all or nothing at all, that is the way of the viking.
