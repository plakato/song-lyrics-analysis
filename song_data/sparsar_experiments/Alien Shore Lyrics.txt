Alien Shore Lyrics
by Rush.


You and I, we are strangers by one chromosome.
Slave to the hormone, body and soul.
In a struggle to be happy and free.
Swimming in a primitive sea.
You and I, we must dive below the surface.
A world of red neon and ultramarine.

Reaching to the alien shore.

For you and me, sex is not a competition.
For you and me, sex is not a job description.
For you and me.
We agree.

You and I, we are pressed into these solitudes.
Color and culture, language and race.
Just variations on a theme.
Islands in a much larger stream.

For you and me, race is not a competition.
For you and me, race is not a definition.
For you and me.
We agree.

But that's just us....
Reaching for the alien shore.

You and I, we reject these narrow attitudes.
We add to each other, like a coral reef.

Reaching for the alien shore.

For you and me, race is not a competition.
For you and me, sex is not a definition.
For you and me, we hold these truths to be self-evident.
For you and me, we'd elect each other president.
For you and me.
We might agree.

But that's just us....
Reaching for the alien shore.
