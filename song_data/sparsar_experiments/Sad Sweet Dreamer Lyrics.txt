Sad Sweet Dreamer Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Sad sweet dreamer is just one of those things.
You put down to experience.
Sad sweet dreamer is just one of those things.

You put down to experience.
Been another blue day without you.
Girl.
Been another sad summer song.
Been thinkin' about you.
Girl.
AII night long.
Been another sad tear on my pillow.

Been another memory who told me You're the one girl.
Been thinkin' about you.
Girl all night long.
Sad sweet dreamer is just one of those things.
. ..
Been another long night and I missed you.
Girl.
Been another story from those endlees magazines.

Can't help thinkin' about you.
Girl.
All night long.

Sad sweet dreamer is just one of those things.
. ..

Was so happy when I found you but how was I to know.
That you would leave me walkin' down the road.
Been another hurt love story.
Been another man.
Who thought that he was oh so strong.
Been thinkin' about you.
Girl.
All night long.

Sad sweet dreamer is just one of those thing.
....
