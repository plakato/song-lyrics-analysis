Valley [Panda Freestyle] Lyrics
by Yung Rudd.


Yo.
Feels good to be back.
Happy 4/20 everybody.
2 Much Vybz.
Yo.
You know 1 thing, I always rep where I'm from, dawg.
You know where that is.
Valley/Diego.

I'm a boss from the valley.
This rapping shit right up my alley.
All these mooks them, they're faling.
I tell them, Hold up there, pally....
Try pull me down like some panties.
When you be secretly fanning?
Dread, allyuh should call me Manning.
Cause I smoked 2 super bowls with my ex girl.
Who live up in Cali.
Yeah she my ex, but she's family.
She believe's I'll be real big.
And that I'm fresh like I'm Mannie.
Sending some love to my granny.
Elsie what's cracking?
I got your backing.
Crazy that you understand me.
Promise you I'll win a grammy.

Real nigga on the flow.
Man I swear it feels so good to be back.
Can't stand the faking, niggas be MAC.
Please give up on the show.
Beast is what's the mode.
Girls be constantly asking, What's up?
But they say women be shady like the.
Retreat in bago.

The government lies, and gets caught a lot.
Yet still we do not do more to stop?
That shit is rather unorthodox.
That's why I write down these thoughts a lot.
I have as much respect for ignorance.
As I have for neighbourhood enforcer cops.
So I work hard to secure the top.
Lyrics, they've got a scope for the ops.

Shoutout Worm.
Addict Gang.
Shoutout birds.
Have this wang.
Shoutout Nokhs.
That nice tree.
Inzey's moms.
RIP.

Congrats on the new soca monarch, now the youth have a Voice.
Preedy and Anson in second? Just want to shout out my boys.
Got a hot girl, send her like Marcos, sure I'ma score like Reus.
D cups? Ain't no second guessing like if it's B in multiple choice.
Yeah I'ma get her moist.
Then light up that kush, cause I have the spark.
Niggas, they're fishy like kois.
But I catch you all like a magikarp.
Friendsing with allyuh men? I'ma pass.
I don't trust shit. Even check TP after I wipe my ass.
Roll up a big one and light it fast.
'Til I'm the highest.
After I smoke, back out to work, bout dollar signs like I'm Ty it's.
Fuego when I flick my wrist.

Always be repping that Trinity.
Trapso got people into me.
Although a Rudder done been a beast.
Some people moving so finnicky.
But there's the people who tell me good luck.
And break a leg, no injury.
How I come up with these similes?
Scooby Doo can't solve that mystery.

Just know that I'm too ill.
Some say that I'm too chill.
I win doe, like 2 sills.
From inbetween them two hills.
That's Valley.

Valley Valley.
Valley/Diego.
Valley Valley Valley.
Alongside Diego.
Valley Valley.
Valley Valley Valley.
Vally/Diego.
