Immortal 2K Lyrics
by 5th Ward Boyz.


5th Ward and Outlawz x6.

007 of the 5th Ward Boyz.
I'm a little lost.
Me and you, knowin' nothin' but the hustler.
Mafia life and mob musta.
What the loss, 5th Ward Boyz and Outlawz.
Don't give a fuck who you is.
Bitch, I kill your kids.
You a B, get at your kid you can.
Fuck the pen.
A Nigga baptized the sin.
Shots are here, blows of weed and high speed.
Paddy deep, immortal Niggas ride with me.

E.D.I of the Outlawz.
Is it politics or paper.
Ghetto taxes to enslave us.
Babies die, mommas cry.
Ain't nobody come and save us.
Better hate and I hate you then.
Now hate me cause you can't change.
Now hate me cause you blame me of stoppin' this fuckin' thing.
High sign and high tappin' phone, rappin' motherfuckers.
It's Rap-A-Lot Mafia and we at you motherfuckers.
Blast at you motherfuckers, we the most T-lawz.
And the 5th Ward Boyz join the mob and see the mob.

Young Noble of the Outlawz.
Bein' talent than an average jab.
More balanced than an average cat.
Slappin' leg, last for my stack.
I stab with the track.
Call me low ends on the.
Oh you wanna hurt me, or blow a controversy.
I'm the motherfuckin' best Nigga, after Pac.
After stuck at Rap-A-Lot.
I can't wait till we drop.
I'm takin' yours with 8-ball.
Bringin' you all.
In the 5th Ward with them Boyz, fuck it up.
And when we fuckin' it up it ain't FUNNY.
Niggas gotta eat, motherfucker take MONEY.

All.
You live the life of crime.
Blind mine.
Still find time to gettin' high.
We still ride and we still die.
We die even though we try to change in this game.
Still 5th Ward and Outlawz stay remain the same.
Some aim to get with them.
Put your guns in the sky.

One time we all ride.
Outlawz we multiply.
Bye, bye.

E-Rock of the 5th Ward Boyz.
Livin' that mob life, that's sheist fly.
But it's real life.
I put my faith in God, hope I don't die tonight.
It's critical look in these streets.
Fuckin' with me.
Tried for that Nigga Pac, screamin' M.O.B.
Cause it's the mob bitch.
5th Ward and Outlawz.
We can't be stopped.
Rap-A-Lot blowin' up your whole block.
Rollin' bad, beamin' red dots on your head.
Cockin', squeezin'.
To your Fubu  like you bleed so.
Coward guys, when you see E-Rock.
Fuckin' these bitch Niggas, bustin' nuts with my Glock.

Kastro of the Outlawz.
Gettin' punch-drunk, motherfuckin' hoes in my underwear.
From out the gutter, life stink like hootie-hair.
I been there, that's why I survive anywhere.
Fried any tear, don't believe this here.
Yeah, these Niggas is lame, tamed as Puff Daddy.
Scared shots out they Glock when they caught at me.
Hard scratched me, even harder to relax me.
You a bitch, boy and 5th Ward be body on the bags.

Lo-Life of the 5th Ward Boyz.
This shit's comin' from a mile away.
Don't make me shit a style a day.
Lend of shots to your block.
Till the corners throw their ride away.
Ain't weezin up, we heatin' up.
Ready for rush hour.
Throwin' up gas and powder.
Screamin' money and the power die.
Motherfucker, go try your luck up and fuck up.
Don't let your smooth chase.
Fool your ass, what you gonna hush us.
We did it out the car man.
Put your ass in the ride.
When Niggas die of homicide.
fuckin' sky.

5th Ward Boyz and Outlawz x3.
