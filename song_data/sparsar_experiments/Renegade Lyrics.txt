Renegade Lyrics
by The Qemists.


I'M, a renegade I'm a rebel
Don't worry about me. Don'T worry about me
I'm a renegade, I'm a rebel
Don't worry about me. Don'T worry about me
 ... 

For, my Renegades for my tyrants
Wile out til the place get violent
Eardrums bleed. Now we suffer in silence
Place on smash â€˜til. We see the sirens
Embrace, the drama
No hope for the light lets paint it darker
 Gim me more of what you got cos. I need it faster
No time for the past. In an unwritten saga
You know the drill
Theres an answer for all in a bottle of pills
But thats run of the mill
Resist, the easy life don't break the seal
Thats, the start to the nightmare
Life passes by, but its always right, there
Renegade rules. So we just don't care
Live life like a rebel cos. This ain't no timeshare

I'm a renegade. I'M a rebel
Don't worry about me. Don'T worry about me

Put your drink down and get nuts
Cos there ain't one drop getting left in the glass
Down drinks. Then I'm ordering more
I'm causing a problem Hard to ignore
I'm a renegade
I'm, a renegade. I'M a rebel
Don't worry about me. Don'T worry about me
I! Don'T do rules, I'm like that. That'S cool
I'm, Maxsta search it on Google
Put Grime on a stage near you

I'm. A renegade
Don't worry about me. Don'T worry about me

So its time for change. Man
A new revolution
Red lights mean nothing so lets start the movement
Suits and ties just spread, confusion
Face the reality and break the illusion
Nothing to give, then you got nothing to lose
Nothing to show that means there's nothing to prove
Nothing. To say that means theres, nothing to do
Well. If thats the case, then just Join The Q

It, don't really matter how you choose to do. This
Force fed ideals start to lose it
It, don't really matter how you're gon na get through this
Feel. The beat in your chest then use it
Ghost in the shell Spirit In The System
Hear. The whispers screams are distant
See the shadow and it starts in an instant
Eyes shut tight. All you do is listen..

I'm a renegade. I'M a rebel
Don't worry about me. Don'T worry about me

Put your drink down and get nuts
Cos. There ain't one drop getting left in the glass
Down drinks. Then I'm ordering more
I'm causing a problem Hard to ignore
I'm a renegade
I'm, a renegade. I'M a rebel
Don't worry about me. Don'T worry about me
I! Don'T do rules, I'm like that! That'S cool
I'm, Maxsta search it on Google
Put Grime on a stage near you

End, 

I'm, a renegade x9
I'm, a renegade. I'M a rebel
I'm, a renegade, I'm a rebel
Don't worry about me. Don'T worry about me
I! Don'T do rules, I'm like that! That'S cool
I'm, Maxsta search it on Google
Put Grime on a stage near you
I'm, a renegade
