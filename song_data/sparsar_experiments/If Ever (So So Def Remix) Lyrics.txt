If Ever (So So Def Remix) Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Jermaine Dupri.
So So Def.
All I do is rock girl.
What about you?
What about you?
All I do is rock girl.
What about you?
What about you?

3rd Storee.
Someone's in love with you.
Don't you know?
They just don't wanna let their feelings show.
Cause their not sure that you can feel the same.
Wanna make sure that you.
Feel the same way.

3rd Storee.
Yeah, so now he would like to take a chance.
In hopes that you both will find romance.
In case that you're willing.
There's something I'm feeling.
There's something that I want you to know.

3rd Storee.
Girl if ever you call me.
I'll be there for you right or wrong.
Girl if ever you need me.
I'll promise I will give you my all.

3rd Storee.
Someone who will love and sacrifice.
Who knows what it means to treat you right.
Someone who won't change his mind.
Willing to give his time.
One who will always feel the same.

3rd Storee.
He wants you to open up your heart.

In hopes you will start.
To love him in every way.
He likes to take a chance.
In hopes that you'll find romance.
In hopes that you'll always feel the same.

3rd Storee.
Girl if ever you call me.

I'll be there for you right or wrong.

Girl if ever you need me.

I'll promise I will give you my all.

Baby Stase.
Yo if you need me, feed me.
But don't be pity, be easy.
That's the way you greet me.
You saw on the cd, I write it.
You saw me on your TV.
You're talking 'bout the way that I dance.
The way that I move.
You young man better stay in school.
Keep it brief, keep it sweet.
I ain't gonna tell a story.
Baby Stase, make it hot.
Don't stop the story.

Loon.
You ain't never too young to fall in love.
But see I never had a chance to fall in love.
I used to ball with thugs get it on with slugs.
Young cat, one gat, running all the drugs.
Then I changed my life even changed my ice.
My girl was actin' up so I changed my wife.
JD took a player out this dangerous life.
Harlem World, All Out baby name your price what?

3rd Storee.
Girl if ever you call me.

I'll be there for you right or wrong.

Girl if ever you need me.

I'll promise I will give you my all.

Girl if ever you call me.
I'll be there for you right or wrong.
Girl if ever you need me.
I'll promise I will give you my all.
Girl if ever you call me.
I'll be there for you right or wrong.
Girl if ever you need me.
I'll promise I will give you my all.
