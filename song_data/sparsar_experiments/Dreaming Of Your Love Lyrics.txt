Dreaming Of Your Love Lyrics
by The World Famous Tony Williams.


I'm to blame, I'll take the blame.
I double guarantee that I will not complain.
Just admire light the flame that got heated out.
Burn up in a fire.
Gotta get you back, girl you're that.
One that takes me higher, I'm.

Dreaming of your love.
Stop, I'm your lover, baby.
Dreaming of your love.
It's hot under covers, baby.
Dreaming of your love.
Don't want no other, baby.
Dreaming of your love.
Don't wanna say good night.

Feels like I'm sauced, what can it be?
Gotta call it somethin'.
Like I'm lost, hangin' on the sheets.
Dreamin' and I'm wantin'.
And I toss, and I'm perspiring.
Swear I hear applause.
When I wake up, I'll be waiting on your call.
Baby I'll be.

Girl I've been wrong, but oooh come and save me.
Should be dreamin' while you're holdin' me.
Can't live with you gone, come back home, come and wake me, lady.
Girl I'm much too tired, of sleep.
Oh girl I've been dreaming of your love.
Girl I've been dreaming of your love.
