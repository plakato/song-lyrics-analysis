Amenamy Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


Somberly somberly
Linger lie longer-ly
Grateful our cold memories, cry
For the plentiful times that that
Her eagerly death, hath had
Counter, intuitive underride
Clean thy sparkling teeth
Brush down thy sparkling sides
That thy nervous blood
Would become undone from
Impedious, pounding ideas

Some, shattering fawn
For. This candented dawn
Pluck up their worm holes and give them
To feeders that spirits be freer

Some shattering fawn
For. This candented dawn
Pluck up their worm holes and give them
To feeders that spirits be freer and freer

And broil and toil and foil thy
Scalloped breastbone
Roll, and toll and fold
The long winters in it
Think. Not what the season'll become
Reap fruitfully of the gardendom
That grew masterfully over your
Withering son

Beat out them bed bugs
Stand when you do it
Beat out them. Bed bugs
Stand when you do it

Some shattering fawn
For. This candented dawn
Pluck up their worm holes and give them
To feeders that spirits be freer

Some shattering fawn
For. This candented dawn
Pluck up their worm holes and give them
To feeders that spirits be freer and freer and freer and.
