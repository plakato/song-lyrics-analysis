Steady Stayin' Paid '95 Lyrics
by 51.50.


Feindin', like a bitch To stay in the game, 
Hustlin' n strain - I was up 
But. Now, I'm long came 
Money's, comin', slow, 
A little at a time. 
Nickels and dimes on my all night grind: 
Ain't enough to survive. 
Every second counts: 
I need cash. 
Times is gettin' critical, 
I, better think fast, 
'Corporation corrupt' 
That's, where I'm headed 
My best opportunities, 
Is catchin', suckas, slippin', 
On, the late night 
Somewhere ..., I'm gripin' on my nine 
I. Think I'm just the type 
Cuz it's about that time, 
I'm serious as fuck 
Ain't nothin'. Really funny 
Smokin' on the weed 
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about some money; 
Fuck it To me. It'S kinda, simple 
Break, yaself, partna 
Then. I pop you in the temple 
There's alot at stake. 
But the stakes will be taken: 
Out to empty your pockets. 
It'S, your house 
I'll be 
 
Breakin' and enterin' 
Enterin' and takin' 
From that point on 
My occupation was steady. Stayin' paid 
 
It was sumthin' bout that hour 
That. I fell back at that first time, 
Made a little money on the corner, 
Bought my first nine 
Thinkin' about what to do 
Wanted to have some fun 
Thinkin'. I might go jackin' with this nickel plated nine 
Millimeter for my back 
I couldn't re-tell the damn thang 
Thinkin'. It'S kinda funny 
Robbin' people feelin' like a king, 
That was kinda. Sick 
I really must be losin' it 
If. I could rob myself. I probably would be doin' it 
 
Sometimes, when I'm alone 
I dream that it's a different game. 
Niggas come out the streets, 
Not thinkin', about this dope game. 
 ... don't exist. 
Money is comin' fast 
I. Wake up every mornin' with this pocket full of cash, 
I'm peepin' in all the stacks 
So much I don't know what to do. 
I oughta go buy a car, a ..., BMW 
And. When I'm awake It's back again. Reality 
No, fakin' 
I, sit back and think about this real money: makin' 
When, I'm 
, 
Interlude, 
Hello, 
-Hey, whats up dawg. It'S Run D, mayne, 
Whats, up fool, 
-Ah shit, mayne, chillin', Ay, mayne check this out mayne, we got the smooth 
Come up poppin' off tonight. Man is you down or what 
I'm on my way mayne 
-Hey nigga you bring that milly mill boy We gon' be paid tonight. Patna 
Trust me 
Aiight, 
, 
In 1995, when a nigga be like I gots ta get mine. 
 Got ta live this life on this grind 
And. I think I'm losin' my mind 
As. If I'm stuck on how to get paid 
If, I can't get paid man. I'M stuck 
 Got ta think how I'ma come up somehow I gots ta blow up 
Sho nuff 
All. I dream is money. Sunny days, shinin' green 
 Got ta, go to win in my mouth 
Then'bout step on the scene, 
It's just a daily routine of this money. Fiend dream 
Comin' up hard as it seem. Never really was a thing. 
 
I was born to live. My live, 
I'ma live my live and die. 
Another bad creation of a hustla was given life. 
To learn the tricks of the trade that steady, stayin' paid. 
I picked up on game 
Until. A criminal was made 
 
Put this on everything I love. 
Blood is thicker than mud. Feel me 
If, you don't you bussin' tryna kill me 
See. I can take pain, 
For years of the agony, 
It's just the man in me, 
I got ta. Have my fantasy 
But, you ain't understandin' me .
