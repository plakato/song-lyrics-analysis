Steady Stayin' Paid '95 Lyrics
by 51.50.


Feindin' like a bitch, To stay in the game.
Hustlin' n strain, I was up.
But now I'm long came.
Money's comin' slow.
A little at a time.
Nickels and dimes on my all night grind.
Ain't enough to survive.
Every second counts.
I need cash.
Times is gettin' critical.
I better think fast.
'Corporation corrupt'.
That's where I'm headed.
My best opportunities.
Is catchin' suckas slippin'.
On the late night.
Somewhere ... I'm gripin' on my nine.
I think I'm just the type.
Cuz it's about that time.
I'm serious as fuck.
Ain't nothin' really funny.
Smokin' on the weed.
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about some money.
Fuck it, To me it's kinda simple.
Break yaself partna.
Then I pop you in the temple.
There's alot at stake.
But the stakes will be taken.
Out to empty your pockets.
It's your house.
I'll be.

Breakin', and enterin'.
Enterin', and takin'.
From that point on.
My occupation was steady stayin' paid.

It was sumthin' bout that hour.
That I fell back at that first time.
Made a little money on the corner.
Bought my first nine.
Thinkin' about what to do.
Wanted to have some fun.
Thinkin' I might go jackin' with this nickel plated nine.
Millimeter, for my back.
I couldn't re-tell the damn thang.
Thinkin' it's kinda funny.
Robbin' people, feelin' like a king.
That was kinda sick.
I really must be losin' it.
If I could rob myself, I probably would be doin' it.

Sometimes when I'm alone.
I dream that it's a different game.
Niggas come out the streets.
Not thinkin' about this dope game.
... don't exist.
Money is comin' fast.
I wake up every mornin' with this pocket full of cash.
I'm peepin' in all the stacks.
So much I don't know what to do.
I oughta go buy a car, a ... BMW.
And when I'm awake, It's back again reality.
No fakin'.
I sit back and think about this real money makin'.
When I'm.

Interlude.
Hello?
-Hey, whats up dawg, it's Run D mayne.
Whats up fool.
-Ah shit mayne, chillin', Ay mayne, check this out mayne, we got the smooth.
Come up poppin' off tonight man is you down or what.
I'm on my way mayne.
-Hey nigga, you bring that milly mill boy? We gon' be paid tonight, patna.
Trust me.
Aiight.

In 1995, when a nigga be like I gots ta get mine.
Gotta live this life on this grind.
And I think I'm losin' my mind.
As if I'm, stuck on how to get paid.
If I can't get paid, man I'm stuck.
Gotta think how I'ma come up, somehow I gots ta blow up.
Sho nuff.
All I dream is money, sunny days, shinin' green.
Gotta go to win in my mouth.
Then 'bout step on the scene.
It's just a, daily routine of this money fiend dream.
Comin' up, hard as it seem, never really was a thing.

I was born to live my live.
I'ma live my live and die.
Another bad creation of a hustla was given life.
To learn the tricks of the trade, that steady stayin' paid.
I picked up on game.
Until a criminal was made.

Put this on everything I love.
Blood is thicker than mud, Feel me?
If you don't, you bussin', tryna kill me.
See I can take pain.
For years of the agony.
It's just the man in me.
I gotta have my fantasy.
But you ain't understandin' me.
