My Life is Sweet Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


My life is sweet.
You could tell by the Benz and the Beamers and the Jeeps.
Big wheels, big grills make them say oooh-weee.
Custom made Bentleys, t.v.s, mink seats.
Make them scream wha-wha.

Curren$y.
Cars and shut it down any set, first dude in the city.
To have Intevet, equipped with the Internet.
Performance chip, is faster than any jet.
I'm down the block, and you ain't even start your engine yet.
I use to hustle on the block for rent.
Met P, and I ain't came out of my pocket since.
See all these chicks, wanna get with me.
Because the 6 got more appliances, than Circuit City.

Desperado.
Afficial we the Reebok boys, call us a classic.
And rap slowly up on the block, gun and a package.
I leave the country, cause Paris cooler.
Fall back and take a day off like Farris Bueler.
Young punks I'm the ruler, you follow my lead.
Slow down I been doing this, the product of speed.
Can't roll but I'm a weed blower, I get my ki's lower.
16-5 a few weeks, I'll have a green roller.

Yukon.
I thought I told you, the flow don't stop.
And it ain't No Limit on the stage, if the show don't rock.
You can still, catch me up in them clubs.
In that 2K3 Yukon, sitting up on them dubs.
Since they wanna know, about my whip.
I'ma tell em like this, I got enough keys to start a dealership.
Now how they think they floss toys.
When we in places, so far from home they call us the Lost Boys.

S-Flames.
When I go to the lot, they call me Connect Four.
Cause I bought four cars on the road, with four doors.
Spend another mill, put diamonds on the grill.
Push a button, and my gun pop out the steering wheel.
It's real, stack dough and make more.
While you cats come up slow, like Lamborgini doors.
You might see me in a Range, you might see me in a Porsche.
I get paid every month, like child support.

Krazy.
Luxury, I love that bird it's easy.
Lift it out, but still a Jag can't please me.
But a 6, without the rims is cheesy.
Like a bitch, I like my tires breezy.
The spinners, on my Navi to tease me.
With a sunroof open, it's kind of breezy.
With a tank on my neck, that just might freeze me.
I'm scared of a Viper, she'd like to see that.

Master P.
You ever ate a cheeseburger, on a million dollar plate.
Flew to Paris or France, just to get away.
Like to party, so we buy the club.
Every whip that we drive, be on 24's or dubs.
The new Hummer, had it before it came out.
200 and 50 G's, I put it in my mouth.
Bought a mansion whodie, just to make music.
Like the President got a jet and don't even use it.
When it comes to ghetto balling, there is none higher.
Get a supermodel for a banker, two million dollar wires.
In the winter whodi, we sleep on mink coats.
In the summer we on the water putting chandeliers and boats.
My cousin get athlete money, and don't even ball.
My son's only 12, and he could buy the mall.
Call me Ghetto Bill, cause I love the cheese.
I don't gang bang, my favorite color is green.
