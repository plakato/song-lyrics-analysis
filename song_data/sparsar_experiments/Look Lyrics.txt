Look Lyrics
by Yung Jake.


Look at my watch. Look at all of these diamonds.
Look. Just look. Look at the way that they shinin'.
These niggas forgot who I was, so let me remind them.
They like: who is that nigga Yung Jake and who are those niggas behind him?

Look; open your eyes.  I'm right in front of you niggas.
At the top it's just us. Look. I don't see none of you, niggas.
I'm sonnin' you niggas; each every one of you niggas.
I know that it isn't a race but I just be running through niggas.
Now look what you see:  a young nigga with money.
I'm not at the comedy club, but niggas they funny.
These niggas, they fake, they front  just like veneers.
Deaf to these niggas. Yung Jake. What? I cannot hear.
I can't adhere. I cannot stick with these niggas.
This is my table. You cannot sit with me, nigga.
Periphery niggas. You niggas is out of my sight.
Look. I know we had sex, ho, but please get out of my sight.
I'm 'bout to go in just like a foot in some slippers.
Look at my table, man, look: it's just me and my niggas.
Okay you can come through as long as you bring some more bitches.
And just so you know: those bitches you bring gone be coming home with us.
Look. I'm not gonna stop. Look at the light. I don't care if it's red, nigga.
Weekend at Burnie's... you just a dead nigga.
You just a Fred nigga, soft, yeah, you just a Ted nigga.
Just like that movie. except you make no bread, nigga.
Look. I'm bout my bread. These other niggas they just gluten-free.
Look. It's not a contest my little nigga. Just look, look at you, look at me.

If you do, you will see that you niggas out of my league.
Look at your bed sheets my nigga. That is my seed!
Look at the video. Look at all of the views.
And look at the comments, and look at the haters, man, all of them yous.
And look at the people you came here with, nigga, look, all of them dudes.
And if you guys try to run up on me, I'm calling the goons.
Look, all I can think about money. It must be the jew in me.
You're trying to have what I have. You're trying to ruin me.
But look, it's not gonna work cause I am just doing me You can try to do you.
too but you will be doing me.
Now look at your ho. She looks like an experiment.
And look at the molly I dropped in the water. I ain't gone be sharing it.
We puff on that loud. My niggas be blaring it.
Vercace, the Gucci, the 'Gonia, the Truey. My niggas be wearing it.
Now look at you girlfriend again.  She looks like a dude.
And who are thoses people that don't belong here, dog, I'm looking at you.
That party was fine how it was. Just niggas and Jews.
Look. Look at us. We richer than you.
Look at me now. I'm rocking a dress.
And look at your bitch. She's reeking of sex.
I am not saying I fucked her, I am not saying I didn't.
My pockets are full of these hundreds. Your pockets are filled up with lint.
