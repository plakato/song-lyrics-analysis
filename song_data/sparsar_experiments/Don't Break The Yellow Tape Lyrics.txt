Don't Break The Yellow Tape Lyrics
by The 3rd Kind.


I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor.
That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone if possible: Jew, gentile, black man, white.
We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.
We don't want to hate and despise one another.
In this world there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can.
provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way.
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has.
goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in.
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity.
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in man, cries.
out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of.
despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men.
torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me I say, Do not despair..
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.
