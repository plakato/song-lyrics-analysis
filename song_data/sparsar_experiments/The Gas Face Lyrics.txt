The Gas Face Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

MC Serch.
Aiyo man, my labelmate Don Newkirk.
Man step to 'em.

Don Newkirk.
Thanks Serch!
And now... for the Prime Minister....
Sinister... Pete... N-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hice!
Nice, Nice, Nice.

MC Serch.
Kick 'em in the grill, Pete!

Gas, past tense, made facially.
3rd Bass'll express, KMD.
Three blind mice on sight.
Zev Lover, gave it the first light.
A grin shows a trick up a sleeve.

What a tangled web they weave.
Deceivers, stupefied through fable.
Say Let's Make a Deal at the dinner table.
Put you on tour, put your record on wax.
Sign your life on the X.
You exit, x-off, but what you really get:.
A box of Newports, and Puma sweats.
Tex feeds and frowns upon Emus.
To give up Gas Face he drinks from a Thermos.
Sub Roc cut at you with a clipper.
Gas Face given, I beg to differ.

MC Serch.
Pete that was real def, man, but I gotta get serious now.
Aiyo Don, step to 'em again.

Don Newkirk.
Everybody... MC Serch!

Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black.
Musta been a white guy who started all that.
For those little white lies.
My expression to the mountainous blue eyes.
Then form a face, and shake my skull cap.
Dismiss the myth, that evil is not black.
But opposite spectrum, this done by red man.
With horns on his head, laid down the ill plan.
Got all his helpers, said, Make it snappy!
Tell all the people that their hair can't be nappy!
Blonde and blue-eyed, or dark-skinned heffer, G.
A disease, created by leprosy.
Don't speak of bleach, bend them to right.
Say it was night WAY before the light.
Put aside spooks, Serch leaves a trace.
I've set em correct with the effect of the Gas Face.

MC Serch.
Next up, Don?

Don Newkirk.
A special appearance by KMD's Zev Love X!

Zev Love X.
A Gas Face can either be a smile or a smirk.
When appears, a monkey wrench to work one's clockwork.
Perkin his brim to the rim of my cup.
Don't tempt me, you're empty, so fill'er up!
Is I'm talkin coffee or cocoa, is you loco?
Cash or credit for unleaded at Sunoco.
KMD and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole.
I mean soul, so make the Gas Face.
Damn, if looks could kill.
You look like host was a ghost from your grill.
But still, what's the new fed, to recollect.
To our passing phase to facades to '80-deca.
For my label reads Hood, street might have a tattoo.
Don't pick any card or no rabbit from my hat.
Never a magician if I ever tricked em.
Oh shit! Another Gas Face victim.

MC Serch.
There it is, yo fellas man.
Why don't you step to the mic man?

Zev Love X.
That's how I kicks it, for 80-deca.

MC Serch.
