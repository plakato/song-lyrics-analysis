The Gas Face Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

Mc Serch 
Aiyo man, my labelmate Don Newkirk 
Man step to'em 
, 
Don, Newkirk, 
Thanks, Serch 
And, now ... for the Prime Minister, ... 
Sinister ... Pete ... N-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hice 
Nice, Nice, Nice 
, 
MC, Serch 
Kick'em in the grill Pete 
 
Gas past tense made facially 
3rd Bass'll express Kmd 
Three blind mice on sight, 
Zev Lover gave it the first light. 
A grin shows a trick up a sleeve
 
What, a tangled web. They weave 
Deceivers stupefied through fable 
Say. Let'S Make a Deal at the dinner table. 
Put you on tour, put your record on wax 
Sign your life on the X 
You exit x-off, but what you really get 
A box of Newports and Puma sweats 
Tex feeds and frowns upon Emus 
To give up Gas Face. He drinks from a Thermos 
Sub Roc cut at you with a clipper 
Gas Face, given, I beg to differ, 
 
MC, Serch 
Pete. That was real def man, but I got ta get serious now: 
Aiyo Don step, to'em again: 
 
Don, Newkirk, 
Everybody, ..., MC Serch, 
 
Black cat is bad luck, bad guys! Wear black 
Musta been a white guy who started all that 
 For those little white lies. 
My expression to the mountainous blue eyes, 
Then form a face and shake my skull cap 
Dismiss the myth that evil is not black, 
But opposite spectrum. This done by red man, 
With horns on his head laid down the ill plan 
Got. All his helpers said Make it snappy 
Tell all the people that their hair can't be nappy, 
Blonde and blue-eyed, or dark-skinned. Heffer G 
A disease created by leprosy 
Don't speak of bleach, bend them to right 
Say. It was night WAY before the light. 
Put aside, spooks Serch leaves a trace 
I've set em correct with the effect of the Gas Face. 
 
MC Serch 
Next up Don 
, 
Don, Newkirk, 
A special appearance by KMD's, Zev Love X, 
, 
, Zev, Love X, 
A Gas Face can either be a smile or a smirk. 
When appears a monkey wrench to work one's clockwork, 
Perkin his brim to the rim of my cup. 
Don'T, tempt me you're empty, so fill'er up, 
Is, I'm talkin, coffee or cocoa. Is you loco, 
Cash or credit for unleaded at Sunoco, 
KMD and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole 
I mean soul so make the Gas Face. 
Damn if looks, could kill. 
You look like host was a ghost from your grill 
But. Still, what's the new fed to recollect 
To our passing phase to facades, to'80-deca 
For, my label reads: Hood street might have a tattoo 
Don't pick any card or no rabbit from my hat 
Never a magician. If I ever tricked em 
Oh shit, Another Gas Face victim, 
, 
MC, Serch 
There. It is yo fellas man 
Why. Don'T you step to the mic? Man, 
 
Zev, Love X, 
That's, how I kicks it for 80-deca,
