Fade Away Lyrics
by Vivid.

All the things I had to say.
Morbid schemes while reaching fame.
Made one false move once again.
Losing ground but still I stand.
I can't soothe the thoughts that plague.
Me for making what I made.
And so I'll try to seal my fate.
My aims obliterate.
I seemed to get it all.
From way behind the wall.
It's better to burn than lose it all.
Not to fade away and lose control.
It's better to burn out than lose it all.
It all....
If this move will be a win.
Will I pay for who I've been.

Is it worth while living fast.
Dying young is for the best.
Don't try to break my fall.
You can't delay the stall.
It's better to burn than lose it all.
Not to fade away and lose control.
It's better to burn out than lose it all.
It all....
Look at me I'm falling through your fingers.
I can hardly stop it.
Look at me I'm slipping slowly.
Slower than a bullet leading there.
It's better to burn than lose it all.
Not to fade away and lose control.
It's better to burn out than lose it all.
It all.
