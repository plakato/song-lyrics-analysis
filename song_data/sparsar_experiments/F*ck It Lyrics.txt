Bet I pull up on your bitch nigga fuck it.
Drunk but still drinking nigga fuck it.
Who spent a mil in one day nigga fuck it.
Got a problem grab the chopper nigga fuck it.
Yeah fuck it, talkin' cash shit, fuck it.
And that's yo ass nigga, fuck it.
Hit the gas fuck it, and then I dash, fuck it.
I see yo bitch, fuck it, you know I smash ay, fuck it.
Don't give no fuck, fuck it, ain't got no class ay, fuck it.

When it come to bitches I done paid my dues.
Might do somethin' different go and take a cruise.
All my niggas win, we ain't never lose.
Gettin' money on the regular that's what we do.
Might X you out the play and run off with the sack.
Always makin' movies but don't even act.
The shit a nigga doin' please don't re-enact.
I ain't never told a lie, all I state is facts.
Walk up to my jeweler like fuck it.
When I seen yo bitch I had to touch it.
Fucked her in one day, it was nothin'.
A nigga like Sonny never cuffin'.

Hundred band juug on my plug I had to flex 'em.
Told him it was business only and I still respect 'em.
If he take it personal then fuck it nigga we can get it.
Got this Hershey chocolate chopper that'll send yo ass some kisses.
Bet I pull up on you like you waitin' on a taxi.
Hop up out a van with my dog like Shaggy.
All my niggas shooters they go crazy with the ratchets.
We do what we do and make movies like Bob Saget.
Fuck it I see it I like it I cop it I'm flexin' like Randy Macho.
My niggas they loony they play with them toolies.
Bring beef to your door like Dominoes.
I hang with them killas, guerillas and bands but I am not from Chicago.
My niggas got guns they shoot 'em for fun, they draw 'em up like Picasso.
