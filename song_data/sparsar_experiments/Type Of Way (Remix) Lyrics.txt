Type Of Way (Remix) Lyrics
by Yung Banc.


Jojo World.
I'm Too Cold.

I'm YB Too Cold.
New Nigga Money Old.
Alot of Money So I Really Can't Be Lackin.
Got Money Still Trappin.
Not Signed Still Rappin.
IMG So I Catch A Opp Im Clappin.

I Know They Don't Won't Action.
Cuz I Caught Them Niggas Lackin And They Ran Away.
Caught Em 1 More Time I Took They Life Away.
Birthday Everyday I Gave My Squad Some Cake.
Hyphy Boyz The Team But IMG The Gang.
IMG The Gang Yeah IMG The Gang.
Got Her Off The Molly And She Did The Team.
IMG The Gang We Insane Money Gang.
And If We Catch A Opp He Get Smoked Like Some Green.

Shouts Out My Gang My Niggas Down To Ride.
IMG The Gang &amp; IMM The Mob.
She Can Gimme Top But I Ont Cuff No Thot.
No Homo I Love My Niggas Cuz They Ride Or Die.
No Sympathy For A Opp I Sent Him 30 Shots.
And Then I Caught A Case Cuz I Ont Talk To Cops.
I'm BMT Cuz I Got Big Money And It Talk.
You Guys Is LMW Cuz Lil Money Walk.
They Call Me Too Cold.
And My Money So Long Goddamn Its Hard to Fold.
I Get This Guap And Sometimes My Ice Too Cold.
Imma World Star and All The Thots Know My Name But If You Don't.

I'm YB Too Cold.
New Nigga Money Old.
Alot of Money So I Really Can't Be Lackin.
Got Money Still Trappin.
Not Signed Still Rappin.
IMG So I Catch A Opp Im Clappin.

I Know They Don't Won't Action.
Cuz I Caught Them Niggas Lackin And They Ran Away.
Caught Em 1 More Time I Took They Life Away.
Birthday Everyday I Gave My Squad Some Cake.
Hyphy Boyz The Team But IMG The Gang.
IMG The Gang Yeah IMG The Gang.
Got Her Off The Molly And She Did The Team.
IMG The Gang We Insane Money Gang.
And If We Catch A Opp He Get Smoked Like Some Green.
