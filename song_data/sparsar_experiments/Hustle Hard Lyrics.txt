Hustle Hard Lyrics
by ViZion.


Yea yo.
Authentic Revolution, it's ViZion, and AR.
What up Minim?
It's crazy, what some people would do you know?
246, yo.

Blow back Jamaican, hold a meditation.
High like I'm a spaceman, in the sky I can erase them.
Assess the situation there's a Judas at my table.
So my back is to the wall and I'm gripping on my ray gun.
Informer is leaking information.
Situation's very hot, you can call it cajun.
Whosoever sell me out, get the hell out of my house.
I never let you bring me down, but pray for your salvation.
Yea I'm in a cold space, walking on a razor blade.
Holding up a poker face, praying now for better days.
See me weak, yea they wanna make a move.
But I've got the winner on the river, no I never lose.

So I hustle, hustle hard.
In these streets yea the weak do starve.
I don't, trust them, trust them in the dark.
Cause it's in the dark, your enemies are camouflaged.
So I hustle, hustle hard.
On my own, been this way from the start.
I don't trust them, trust them in the dark.
Cause it's in the dark, your enemies will eat your heart, yea.

Informer is looking, I can see him on the street side.
It's a dirty game that we living on the deep side.
Gotta keep my head above the water, in this riptide.
See you on the flip side, kick, kick to survive.
I'm so alive like the opposite of suicide.
On the rise so they wanna try and stop the vibes.
I'm on the wave, surfing with the tide.
I'll do and die, then I'm off into the bluest sky.

So I hustle, hustle hard.
In these streets yea the weak do starve.
I don't, trust them, trust them in the dark.
Cause it's in the dark, your enemies are camouflaged.
So I hustle, hustle hard.
On my own, been this way from the start.
I don't trust them, trust them in the dark.
Cause it's in the dark, your enemies will eat your heart, yea.

Interlude:.
I'm in a maze, up in a zone.
Trying'a make it out on my own.
Under a haze, blueberry cologne.
Na na now.

And as it grows, from the seed, yea I burn bad mind.
I'm gripping on my destiny like the hands of time.
On the road, that I chose, following the signs.
Never breaking under pressure, AR ready for whatever.
Everday I'm doing it yea, I'm on the grind.
So while I'm living, like a firework, just let me shine.
Ladder to success is tall, so up I climb.
Tell me why they pray for me to fall 'fore I even rise.
And I'm sorry for mistakes.
I've been trying to live much better but I'm doing what it takes.
And the living has no brakes, so you know I gotta chase.
Trying'a be much flyer than my name upon the papes.
And I'm moving, on cause I'm tired of this place.
All these fake friends, smiling in my face.
Saying its a 100 and I only see 98.
Still I'm keeping it secure like a combination safe.

So I hustle, hustle hard.
In these streets yea the weak do starve.
I don't, trust them, trust them in the dark.
Cause it's in the dark, your enemies are camouflaged.
So I hustle, hustle hard.
On my own, been this way from the start.
I don't trust them, trust them in the dark.
Cause it's in the dark, your enemies will eat your heart, yea.
