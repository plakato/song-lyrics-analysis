Do You Wanna Get High Lyrics
by X-Raided.

Do you wanna get high.
Uh do ya wanna get high wit me.
Do you wanna get high.
Uh do ya wanna get high hey.

Just another day livin in the hood.
Why is everybody all up in my business.
Can somebody tell me why can't you do your own thing and let me do mine.
X Raided loc knows how I feel.
People in my mix tryin to sob my tale.
So drop it like it's hot.
Time to shake the spot.
When I need some weed I head to the block.
Singing Mr. Weedman don't do me wrong.
Like Bob Marley, I'mma smoke until my brain is gone.
Mr. Weedman you gotta do me right.
If it's the bomb I'll be back every night.
Mr. Weedman don't do me wrong.
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone.
Mr. Weedman you gotta do me right.
If it's the bomb bomb weed like every night.

Do you wanna get high.
Uh do ya wanna get high  wit me.
Do you wanna get high.
Uh do ya wanna get high  Hey.

Raise up all the windows and blaze the J.
Kick back and let the Calgon take me away.
All I really wanna do is ease my mind.
If I let them, they'll have me stressin all the time.
I wanna get twisted, kick back and rid my brain of the bullshit.
So drop it like it's hot.
Time to shake the spot.
When I need some weed I head to the block.
Singing Mr Weedman don't do me wrong.
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone.
Mr Weedman you gotta do me right.
If it's the bomb bomb weed like every night.
Mr Weedman don't do me wrong.
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone.
Mr Weedman you gotta do me right.
If it's the bomb bomb weed like every night.

Do you wanna get high, uh do ya wanna get high.
Wit me.
Do you wanna get high, uh do ya wanna get high hey.

Do you get high.
Do you wanna get.
Do you get high.
Do you wanna get.
Do you wanna get high, uh do ya wanna get high wit me.

Do you wanna get high, uh do ya wanna get high hey.

All I really wanna do is ease my mind.
If I let them homies stressing all the time.
I wanna get twisted kick back and read my brain of the bullshit.
All I really wanna do is ease my mind.
If I let them homies stressing all the time.
I wanna get twisted kick back and free my brain of the bullshit.
So drop it like it's hot.
Time to hit the spot.
When I need some weed I head to the block.
Singin uh do ya wanna get high wit me hey.
Do you wanna get.
