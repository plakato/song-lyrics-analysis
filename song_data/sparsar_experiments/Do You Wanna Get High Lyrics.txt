Do You Wanna Get High Lyrics
by X-Raided.

Do you wan na get high 
Uh do ya wan na get high wit me 
Do, you wan na get high 
Uh. Do ya wan na get high, hey 
 
Just another day, livin in the hood 
Why? Is everybody all up in my business 
Can. Somebody tell me why can't you do your own thing and let me do mine 
X Raided loc knows how I feel 
People in my mix tryin to sob my tale. 
So drop it like it's hot 
Time to shake the spot 
When. I need some weed I head to the block 
Singing. Mr. Weedman. Don'T do me wrong. 
Like Bob Marley I'mma smoke until my brain is gone. 
Mr. Weedman you got ta. Do me right 
If, it's the bomb I'll be back every night, 
Mr. Weedman! Don'T do me wrong. 
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone. 
Mr. Weedman, you got ta. Do me right 
If, it's the bomb bomb weed like every night, 
 
Do you wan na get high 
Uh do ya wan na get high wit me 
Do. You wan na get high 
Uh, do ya wan na get high, Hey

Raise up all the windows and blaze, the J 
Kick back and let the Calgon take me away. 
All I really wan na do is ease my mind 
If I let them they'll. Have me. Stressin, all the time 
I wan na get twisted, kick back and rid my brain of the bullshit 
So drop it like it's hot 
Time to shake the spot 
When. I need some weed I head to the block 
Singing Mr Weedman. Don'T do me wrong. 
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone. 
Mr Weedman you got ta. Do me right 
If, it's the bomb bomb weed like every night, 
Mr Weedman. Don'T do me wrong. 
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone.
