X Marks The Spot (Prod. Ta-Ku) Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.

Where to BEGIN.
Uhh.
Where to BEGIN.
Uhh.
This off the top nigga.
Fuck a PIN.
Uhh.
You need a PIN.
Uhh.
You need a PIN.
You always right.
But who you PIN to WIN?
I don't WRESTLE.
Nigga I play RUZZLE.
Spelling out words you can't piece together like a PUZZLE.
Hold up did I PUZZLE.
YOU.
If So that's what I DO.
If ya body ripped I will sew YOU.
TOGETHER.
It my time meaning its now or NEVER.
I don't give a damn about BEAVERS.
Nigga that was CLEVER.
Tell me who BETTER?
I'm the young best lyricist in Baltimore n'gga Tell me who BETTER?
Than ME.
When MAMI ride ME.
She she say PAPI.
You got the box wet but I'm not ROCKY.
I need this money ASAP.
I like chicks with a lil junk in the trunk.
Fuck a flat JACK.
PANCAKES.
Moving left and right.
To pan CAKE.
N'ggas start Lincoln up when I EMANCIPATE.
Or PROCLAMate.
If it was a WORD.
I'm the best.
WORD from wild animals.
So fuck what you HERD.
I'm running.
On the run way.
Tyra said I'm STUNNING.
Banking with HILLARY.
I'm the fresh prince but my Uncle ain't PHILIN me.
3 parties with ya girl on the Weekend.
Call it a trilogy.
If you looking for the treasure.
X Marks the spot G.
