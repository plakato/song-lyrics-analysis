Am I Safe Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

All these things keep runnin' through my mind.
Everyone and everything I left behind.
Standing in the cold, grey dawn watching cars go by.
All these things keep runnin' through my mind.

Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
If I don't wanna be with you.

Everyday my heart sinks like a stone.
Carries me away into the undertow.
At the bottom there's no air, there's no sound or light.
All these things keep runnin' through my mind.

Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
If I don't wanna be with you.
Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
If I don't wanna be with you.

Middle 8th.
On my way back home I see a house on fire.
I close my eyes what if it was mine.
It's complicated.
I just don't love you anymore.
I just want to sit here and watch it burn.
Sit and watch it burn.

Setting like a sun into the wild.
Running from myself like when I was a child.
Pictures hanging on the wall when we used to smile.
All these things keep runnin' through my mind.

Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
If I don't wanna be with you.
Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
Am I Safe.
If I don't wanna be with you.
