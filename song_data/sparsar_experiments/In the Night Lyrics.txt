In the Night Lyrics
by Voice.

Horses trampling in my room.
Knights are roaring, they got swords of steel.
One of them is falling down.
The sword deep in his chest that I can feel.

Battlefields and big guns, ev'rywhere I go.
I try to run away from but I am too slow.
Much too slow.

Spiders coming from the wall.
Crawling in my bed, I go insane.
One of them the biggest of all.
Injects me her poison into my vein.

I realize my mind is wrecked, the pulse is beating low.
I try to run away from but I am too slow, much too slow.

In the night in my dreams.
I see odd things in the jungle of my mind.
When I close my eyes.
Mysterious shadows in the still of the night.
Illusion of truth.
Can see the fight between the giants from heaven and hell.
Lay my body down to sleep.
My fancy's awake while I'm dreaming.

A plane is rising to the sky.
Engines are running with deafening roar.

To places eyes have never seen before.

Thousands of light years far away from you.
Aliens around me nothing I can do.

In the night in my dreams....
