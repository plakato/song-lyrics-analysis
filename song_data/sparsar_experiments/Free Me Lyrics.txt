Free Me Lyrics
by Xilent.

Your touch.
Took away my darkest fears and doubts.
Your voice.
Whispers in my ear and shouts out loud.
Free me.
From the shadows in your head.
Please see.
That you were always meant for me.
Free me.
Free me.
Your touch.
Took away my darkest fears and doubts.
Your voice.
Whispers in my ear and shouts out loud.
Free me.
From the shadows in your head.
Please see.
That you were always meant for me.
