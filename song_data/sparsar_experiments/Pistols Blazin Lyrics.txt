Pistols Blazin Lyrics
by 3X Krazy.

Ha, ha.
Eh, eh, eh, eh. Get out my face. Check it.
Mobb shit bitch.
Lynch Mobb mane.
Eh, eh. The Lu-Lun-iz.
3 Times.
Me Ager Man.
Bart.
Let me turn up the heat man.
Dig it the M.O.B. baby.
I'm so hurt!!
Fa sheezy.
Fa sheez.

I fold the cash then I.
Hit away.
Juss a thug fo the money, no love.
Hit 'em up wit the blast.
Put him in a bag, an wrap him.....
Up.

It's all business.
So when the picture come bouncin off yo head.
Don't take it personal.
Money makin needs no rehearsin.
No nigga.
Will come wit disrespect an leave wit they head on they shoulders.

Mobb.
Killaz connected from block to block.
Re-cock the Glock.
Reset the dot.
Heatas.
Beamers.

You gonna believe us.
Time to floss wit me.
Cut off the weak.
You won't decieve us.
Let us mechandise an murderise.
Any an all.
Many will fall.

It's juss an.
O.G. call.
Made from the B.
When I step up, I bet ya Mr. Sick is gonna get to creep.
I gets to blastin ass.
Dip they bodies in the bag.
I hope I.
Get to lastin in this game of cash.

It's paraphanalia.
Not parinoid.
You fuckin wit a pair of boys.
That'll pump yo body full of lead.
An watch it swell up like we got no conscience.

Cuz it ain't no spraya like the one I got.
Claimin you juss a playa but the fakas I sock.
Surround yo weave head.
Fuckin wit the weave head.
Get left wit p head.
I bet ya violent click.
Talkin all that lip.
When you was wit my click an get shit.

Head split an ass kicked in.
Chin shattered.
An nobody could recognize you when they found ya.
An they still don't know who downed ya.

This shit is deeper than you think.
Wit a straight face.
Lay down an come up off them cavy case.
Slow down.
Better pump yo brakes.
Don't know my click from a can of paint.
These niggas won't last.
When I.
Buck one in that ass.
An hit the gate.
I seen two more escape.

It ain't no room for no non-ass soldier niggas.
An it's amazin how the heat bring out the ho in niggas.
When pistols blazin.

Cashin 'em.
Like fresh over fresh.
I'm in the Benz.
Massagin a bitches my rivalry.
Rushed out to get some ends.
Build the twins.
Nigga I love them bitch half Benz.
Strugglin off that gin.
Hoes at the bus stop wanna get in.
But they.
Foot soliders.
Not swangin like a Nova.
Plus them niggas ain't tight.
To make a right an pull my 600 over.
Juss as I left I looked to the corner of my eye.
That it's them same niggas that bucked at me.
But it wasn't my time to die.
Ah.
Pull out my thang.
Hit 'em in the back.
Whatever remained.
So the bitch stay out my business an let the Benzo skirt.
An swang.
Yellin Mobb, clouded wit Age.
For the nigga I said.
I didn't love yo punk ass.
An plus I'm tired of the pain.
Like Cameo this shit is strange.
A nigga doin a dude.
To get his whole neck an head rearranged.
Mobb members, make niggas think about what they doin.
Watch what you pursuin.
Fuck around an get yo whole career ruined.

** x1.

Listen.
Uh.
Little boys an girls listen to me.
It is I that you see.
Gettin high niggas be.
Gettin by on these streets.
Do or die on these streets.
Hit 'em high meet defeat.
Wit 'em tied across the feet.
Niggas lie beneath the creek.
Many try but don't eat.
Much food.
Unless I run wit a fool that picks me up in a Lex.
FUCK SCHOOL.
Let's jet.
Live an direct.
The Yay Area, they carry a.
4-5 an a Tech.
When they bury ya they pissin on the side of you grave.
No witnesses but a buckshot from inside of the gage.
An niggas be gettin pepper sprayed up.
Handcuffed an made to lay down.
Circumstances.
To skanless, manless.
To slang a gang.
Strapped down.
My shit be fully greased up.
Hits the mutha fuckin streets up.
Cuz niggas ain't takin no beat ups.
They re-up wit the heatas.
Leaders of the new school.
But we don't bust a rhyme.
We bust a nine.
Mutha fuckas find.

Mobb material.
Scratch off the serial number.
Fuckin balistic so.
Roll to the riches.
Fuck hoes, bitches, an sluts.
Bubblicious Yuk.
Booku bucks.
My niggas will shoot you up.

** x2.

Now what these niggas tryin to do?
Get gunned down, stomped an pistol whipped fool?
If not I sugguest you get the fuck up out the West.
When it come to gun play.
There's no contest.
I leave you wit two holes.
One in yo dome.
One in yo chest.
An Elliot Ness.
He wouldn't have made it on the West.
And yes.
I know you mutha fuckas heard about us.
Cuz we was all on the news.
Fo Mobb-Style murders.
I crack a fool on top of his head.
Wit a strap.
Told his bitch to come over here.
She sat on my lap.
Man this Mobb shit.
Ain't never been no joke.
You headed straight for the pen.
Or you end up smoked.
That's why I keep a heater.
On my passengers seat.
An I'm Mobb Affiliated.
Uh, uh.
I know you hate it.
I rather be caught.
With my heater.
Then wit out my heater.
It's juss a misdemenor.

I'm crackin backs like a chiropractor.
Come see a Cydal factor.
Get off yo block when rifles splatter.
Come across wit a rival chapter.
Don't be afraid to be blastin.
An don't know nothin bout lastin.
An if he flashin.
We gassin him.
An leavin his ass in a wagon.
The last dragon.
We smashin.
Imagine missin in action.
I hit his ass for his cabbage.
An dissapeared like Aladdin.
An trappin his ass inside a mutha fuckin cave.
Niggas that came wit the pistols.
I got missles and hand grenades.
An some troopers wit bazookaz.
Ready to shoot you.
Do you in.
Crushin boulders wit soldiers.
Cook it an make it pure again.
It's yo friend the Prince Of Darkness.
Whenever the dark hits.
I feel my heart get.
To beatin an you bustas be my target.
PM it's cold heart.

** x2.

We use no parinoia.
Or dedication to our paper it's so deep.
The paraphanalia to the Mobb.
Love to creep.
Our elevations is racin.
Up to the top.
Non-stop.
Wit a caulked back Glock.
Then hop.
Into some cut.
To then nigga skirt-skirt.
You notice I juss do some dirt.
I puttin in work.
I hit them were it hurt.
Crack yo spine time.
Instead of hittin 'em wit my nine.
I'm.
Strictly wit this hit Mobb shit.
Bitch!
Recognize.
What a mutha fucka do is steal.
Right between your eyes.
The nigga was dead before he died.
I slide.
To the next scene.
To the next route.
I'm speakin on what I juss did at the head quarters.
An to my Mobb soldiers.
No one can fold us.
Readin the weakness like some Black Jack.
If niggas can't handle it.
They get stomped from that Mobb attack.
An if you come back from that stompin.
Lay low.
Got 'em.
Hard-headed niggas will get they head put on fire.

It's A-G-E once again.
Pullin you niggas ho cards.
Strapped for them niggas that frontin like bitches.
Tryin to act hard.
It ain't nothin but the mutha fuckin Mobb in me.
I went from sellin coke on the block.
To doin robberies.
To 'luffin yo ass.
Stuffin yo ass.
Up in a trunk punk.
Caught wit a 3 Times circumstance like T-Funk.
Too soon for 'em.
Shoulda had a tomb for 'em.
Non-ass solider niggas.
There'd be no room for 'em.
When Pistols Blazin.
