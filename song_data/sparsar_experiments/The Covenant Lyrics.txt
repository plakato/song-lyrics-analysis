The Covenant Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Faithful to thee....
I try to be.

I'll shake you up like a pack of mister Noodles/.
I'm brutal/ only merciful/ when I.
leave beautiful/ purple/ circles/ on your youthful pupils/.
Your black eye/ on my/ contract is my sole loop hole/.
To escape my inner brute soul/ savage beast/.
Like X-men/ when/ I attack this beat/.
bleeding true flow/.
And lemme be truthful/ I'm the fat kid/ too slow/.
To smash it/ no foot hold/ in the.
door/ quit asking/.
Lord/ for me to follow a new road/ cold/ pavement/.
Few feet, have been this way then/ but pretty soon though/.
Enough is enough! / to have gone.
through yo/ I'm fed up! /.
Got treasures of wisdom but they selling fool's gold/.
When's my record coming?! / I'm Hiphop's Harold.
Camping or something/ waiting/ is.
taking/ a huge toll! /.
Yes I'm whining/ about the timing/ but who knows?! /.
God does/ and that's why it's hard.
but/ I'll endure so/.

Faithful to thee....
I try to be.

Yo, I'm more burnt out than a wooden.
pipe/ sometimes/.
It's like/ I need a break from life/.
this can't be right/.
I guess Jesus, didn't have it easy either/.
I'm the 4th magi, with the poems of a dreamer/.
The wise men were guided by the star in Bethlehem/.
But cause of the smog, I can't see none of them/.
The angels said ‘Peace and goodwill to all men' /.
But I only see the poor in Goodwill.
when I spend/.
So we celebrate the day he was born/ but wait for/.
The day when he gets the throne/ and blows the horn/.
But it's hard to believe that God's a strong tower/.
When buildings are blown up by explosive power/.
I will still trust in Jesus, who calms the storms/.
Lives with the poor/ even with rich kids in college dorms/.
At the glory of love, I learned to bow my face/.
Love ain't a noun, it's a verb and.
that's how I stay/.

Faithful to thee....
I try to be.

Wild sage, or a child of my age? /.
Nah, as I flip my Bible's page/ a smile on my face/.
I've heard it said ‘There's only one Mother Theresa' /.
Yeah yeah yeah but God's a wonderful teacher/.
Sitting at my desk, as a student/ kinda stupid/.
Wondering who's the illest in this music/.
Then I thought, why do I want to be the illest? /.
My mind would rot, I'd rather be healthy, still it's/.
Tempting, cause the demons await/ and Screwtape/.
Is writing a letter to every MC that's fake/.
Yo we gotta go to Hell for Heaven's sake/.
But how much Hell can we take? / when we break/ down it's gates/.
Don't know what fate/ awaits/ but I'm repping this/ cause/.
They never made a statue for a pessimist/ But/.
I'm a soldier in a war/ that's more/ than violent.
Pushes/ I'll write with more ink than.
octopuses/.
Cause I'm…
Faithful and.
Grateful and.
I will do everything I can to make your name known.
