Cell Block Tango Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.

And now the six merry murderesses of the Cook County Jail.
In their rendition of 'The Cell Block Tango'.
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipshutz.
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipshutz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipshutz.
He had it coming, he had it coming.
He only had himself to blame.
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it.
I betcha you would have done the same.
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh Uh, Cicero, Lipshutz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh Uh, Cicero, Lipshutz!
You know how people have these little habits.
That get you down? Like Bernie!
Bernie liked to chew gum. No, not chew, Pop!
So, I came home this one day.
And I'm really irritated.
And looking for a little sympathy.
And there's Bernie.
Lyin' on the couch, drinking a beer and, chewin'.
No, not chewin', poppin'!
So, I said to him, I said.
You pop that gum one more time. and he did.
So I took the shotgun off the wall.
And I fired two warning shots into his head.
He had it coming, he had it coming.
He only had himself to blame.
If you'd have been there, if you'd have heard it.
I betcha you would have done the same.
I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago.
And he told me he was single, we hit it off right away.
So, we started living together.
He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single he told me.
Single my ass!
Not only was he married, oh no, he had six wives.
One of those Mormons, you know.
So that night, when he came home from work.
I fixed him his drink, as usual.
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic.
He had it coming, he had it coming.
He took a flower in its prime.
And then he used it and he abused it.
It was a murder but not a crime.
Now, I'm standing in the kitchen.
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner.
Minding my own business.
In storms my husband Wilber in a jealous rage.
You been screwin' the milkman.
He says.
He was crazy and he kept on screaming.
You been screwin' the milkman.
Then he ran into my knife.
He ran into my knife ten times.
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it.
I betcha you would have done the same.
Mit keresek én itt? Azt mondják, a híres lakóm lefogta a férjem, én meg.
lecsaptam a fejét. De nem igaz. Én ártatlan vagyok. Nem tudom, miért mondja.
Uncle Sam, hogy én tettem. Próbáltam a rendőrségen megmagyarázni, de nem.
értették meg.
But yeah, did you do it?
Uh uh, not guilty.
*whisper* He had it coming.
He had it coming.
My sister, Veronica and I had this double act.
And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us.
With the last number in our act.
We did 20 acrobatic tricks in a row.
One two three four five, splits, spread eagles.
Back flips, flip flops, one right after the other.
Well, this one night before the show.
We were down at the hotel in Cicero.
The three of us, Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice.
So I went out to get some.
I come back, open the door.
There's Veronica and Charlie.
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle.
Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out.
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later.
When I was washing the blood off my hands.
I even knew they were dead.
They had it coming, they had it coming.
They had it coming all along.
I didn't do it, but if I done it.
How could you tell me that I was wrong?
They had it coming, they had it coming.
They had it coming all along.
I didn't do it, but if I done it.
How could you tell me that I was wrong?
I loved Alvin Lipshutz more than I could possibly say, he was a real artistic.
guy, sensitive, a painter.
But he was always trying to find himself.
He go out every night looking for himself.
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving.
I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences.
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead.
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
They had it comin', they had it comin'.
They had it comin' all along.
Cause if they used us and they abused us.
How could you tell us that we were wrong?
He had it coming, he had it coming.
He only had himself to blame.
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it.
I betcha you would have done the same.
You pop that gum one more time.
Single my ass.
Ten times.
Miért csukott Uncle Sam börtönbe.
Number seventeen, the spread eagle.
Artistic differences.
I betcha you would have done the same.
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipshutzs!
