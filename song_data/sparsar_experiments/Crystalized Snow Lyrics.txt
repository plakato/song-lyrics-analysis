Crystalized Snow Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Shawty shawty drop it low.
Shawty wanna show off.
All white snow.
All white crystallized snow.
Shawty shawty drop it low.
Shawty wanna show off.
All white snow.
All white crystallized snow.

Bitch It's Sadboys at the.
top.
Make it rain make it hot.
Double cup.
Pop and stop.
Polo shirt on me like.
Underwater you.
Bring me down to the underwater.
I don't see you anymore.
I'm not wearing swim goggles.
I got Kool aid, Kool aid.
Stacks, I get paid.
You don't know me.
So don't say my name.
My friends are real.
I don't fuck with lames.
Black pants and a purple ice cream belt.
It's hot in the summer.
My ice cream melts.
We roll.

Shawty shawty drop it low.
Shawty wanna show off.
All white snow.
All white crystallized snow.
Shawty shawty drop it low.
Shawty wanna show off.
All white snow.
All white crystallized snow.
