A Couple Grand Lyrics
by Yung Joc.


A couple grand price tag on your head leave you laying where you stand.
A couple grand price tag on your head on your head on your your head.
A couple grand price tag on your head price tag on your head.
A couple grand price tag on your head leave you laying where you stand.

Watch him die slow then his eyes roll in the back of his head.
Now his body cold a couple grand a couple shots.
Couple drip drops now your leakin won't stop bitch.
I'm the man just ask block.
Shots rang out you could hear it for a couple blocks.
Bitch whats my name call me Yung Joc.
I got a great aim all I need is one shot.
Everybody talking in my neighborhood I got great lawyers.
Cause my paper good leave your body riddled wheezing and coughing.
Hear about it live Fox Five with Monica Coffin.
You fuck with mine I'll cause your life line.
I'm a graffiti paint chalk outlines.
And the worst part  is I'm not a coward.
Visit your wake and give your mama dead flowers.

This is not a movie  no reruns.
All sales final no refunds.
Once I make the payment the hits out.
I'm not Jeezy I ain't swappin shit out.
First I tell'em.
Where I what done in the back yard.
Ight in front of your son then I tell'em.
Where to drop him off in the Chattahoochie.
With his dick chopped off.
Yeah it sounds harsh but it's well deserved.
Feed his ass to the sharks for hors d'oeuvres.
No remorse no pity.
This could happen to you in New Joc City.

I gotta couple killers down in free trail.
Put glass in your boogie shit your guts leak out.
The sheriff call your mother and she freak out.
Got her hittin member up got him on speed dial.
Ooh it ain't nothing but a call away.
Come home find your baby sister in the hallway.
911 but it's too late.
She looking like a maxi pad bleeding through the duct tape.
