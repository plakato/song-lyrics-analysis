A Neverending Dream Lyrics
by Xperience.

A neverending dream, a dream of you.
I believe I receive a sign of you.
I am waiting for the night.
Drifting away.
On the waves of my dreams.
To another day.
I am standing on a hill.
And beyond the clouds.
The wind is blowing still.
And catching my doubts.
A neverending dream, a dream of you.
I believe I receive a sign of you.
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too.
As you do and I wanna be with you.
I'm hunting on the night.
The slave to my dream.
An illustrated scene.
Ascends in the steam.
We're playing for the fights.
Emotional games.
I'm turning off my eyes.
And hiding my shame.
A neverending dream, a dream of you.
I believe I receive a sign of you.
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too.
As you do and I wanna be with you.

I'm watching the flowers.
Dying away.
In heated breath of life.
At the dawning day.
I am waking up in spring.
And kissing your face.
The sweet and burning thing.
I feel your embrace.
A neverending dream, a dream of you.
I believe I receive a sign of you.
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too.
As you do and I wanna be with you.
A neverending dream, a dream of you.
I believe I receive a sign of you.
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too.
As you do and I wanna be with you.
I believe I receive a sign of you.
As you do and I wanna be with you.
