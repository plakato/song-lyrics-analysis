Bootie Bop Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..

Yo, yo.
Uh huh, uh huh.
Make em feel this beat.
We ain't seeing nothin but some ass wobblin'.
Goddamn.
Goddamn.

I like to watch them hoes twurk shake and shake that ass.
See this girl know how to work catch my flow when I splash.
Nigga out on the floor bout to get on her head.
Bootie bop then pussy bop and you know how they playin.
I don't wanna lose control.
But I been drinkin' alot and I still wanna go and see these hoes.
It's goin down in the Dirty make your way.
Bend ya knees baby work it like you gonna give it.
Look at her legs partly bowed so you know she's a fool.
That ol' bobble like she straight went to bobblin' school.
Arms up, ass out, g-string in her butt.
I tell ya I'mma bout to pass out from on all that needin' of her.
Hold up wait a minute.
Let a nigga get up in it.
I can't wait 'till ya finished.
Mammi got my head spinnin'.
That bootie be lookin tight.
I'm ready to hit it right.
No need for you to fight.
Cause I'm gonna hit it all night.

Goddamn.
Goddamn ya makin' me hot.
So won't you bop-shi-bop-shi-bop-bop.
Bootie bop.

Now hit it the wall, show the world, girl I like how ya move.
Take of your dress, I wanna fuck ya, and toss you up wit' my crew.
Likin' you, likin' you with a hell of a curve.
This woman's gettin' fifty, mammi need to be served.
Block party gettin' naughty and we off the chain.
A full bang and shake, pull it sideways.
Your body be lookin' good when it get all sweaty.
Like that nigga Jubilee I got you hoes gettin' ready.
Let a nigga put that wood in ya life, alright.
And baby if that pussy good you can ride it all night.
Bootie bop, bootie bop, shorty turnin' me on.
Who's hot, drop me hot, now I'mma give her the bone.
I like em 36-24-36.
But most of all I like 'em with they take that dick.
I got that Hennessey and that fire off top.
Now you can drink to ya bop-bop-bop-bootie bop.

Goddamn.
Goddamn ya makin' me hot.
So won't you bop-shi-bop-shi-bop-bop.
Bootie bop.

Bouce bounce for UNLV.
So won't you bop-shi-bop-shi-bop-bop.
Bootie bop.

Goddamn.
You makin' me hot.
So won't ya, so won't ya, so won't ya.
Bootie bop.

Bend over girl show me what you workin' with.
Bend over girl won't you come and twurk it quick.
Bend over, show a nigga what you workin' with.
Show a nigga what you workin' with.
Bend over girl won't you come and twurk it quick.
Bend over girl show me what you workin' with.
Bend over, show a nigga what you workin' with.
Show a nigga what you workin' with.
