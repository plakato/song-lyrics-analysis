Yo yo 
Uh, huh, uh, huh,

We ain't seeing nothin, but some ass, wobblin'

See. This girl know how to work catch. My flow when I splash 
Nigga out on the floor bout to get on her head, 
Bootie bop, then pussy bop and you know how they playin 
I, don't wan na lose control. 
But I been drinkin' alot and I still wan na go and see these hoes 
It's goin down in the Dirty make your way. 
Bend ya knees, baby work it like you, gon na, give it 
Look at her legs partly bowed. So you know she's a fool: 
That ol' bobble, like she straight, went to bobblin' school 
Arms up ass out g-string in her butt 
I tell ya I'mma bout to pass out from on all that needin' of her 
Hold up wait a minute 
Let a nigga get up In it, 
I can't wait'till ya finished

Likin'. You likin' you with a hell of a curve, 
This woman's gettin'. Fifty mammi need to be served, 
Block party gettin' naughty and we off the chain 
A full bang and shake pull it sideways. 
Your body be lookin' good when it get all sweaty 
Like that nigga Jubilee, I got you hoes gettin' ready, 
Let a nigga put that wood in ya life: alright, 
And baby. If that pussy good, you can ride it all night 
Bootie bop, bootie, bop, shorty turnin' me on
