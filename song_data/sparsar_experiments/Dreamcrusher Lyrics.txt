Dreamcrusher Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Come; follow your soul, onto hope.
Heed not the words others throw.
For the heart is the strongest of all.
Only fear can defeat what is right.
And you can't let it swallow your mind.
But I don't want to feel that we've wasted our lives.
When we're holding our hearts in our hands.
And the terror it looms in our sights.
Tomorrow this fight will tear us from the sky.
To follow the path to the rest of our lives.
Someday we'll find the truth of what's been said.
Find a way to reconcile the lies we're fed.
This fight is noble, can't afford our freedom.
Not like the ones who can't admit what we all know.
For the fallen must arise, a phoenix from the fire.
Carried on the wind, this new crusade begins.
No more chains, I refuse to play the games, never kneel again.
To words others say, when they tell us how to be, find the strength to break.
the lines of fate.

Can you feel it lurking deep within.
I can feel it, striving to begin.
Can you feel it something has to give.
I can feel it rising up again.

Go on have your share, no one can stand in your way.
Who said nothing's fair, I say now's the time to take.

When the dust settles, the silence brings relief.
From all the constant cries of entitlement and greed.
Can you dare to stand apart, and finish what you start.
United on the path, rise up and resist.
Through bone and ash, I see the light in the eyes, broken inside, Dreamcrusher.
We won't go, with the dead, all we know, never said.
Kill the noise, raise your voice.

Can you feel it lurking deep within.
I can feel it, striving to begin.
Can you feel it something has to give.
I can feel it rising up again.

Go on have your share, no one can stand in your way.
Who said nothing's fair, I say now's the time to take.
Go on have your share, no one can stand in your way.
Who said nothing's fair, I say now's the time to take.

This world is a Dreamcrusher.
