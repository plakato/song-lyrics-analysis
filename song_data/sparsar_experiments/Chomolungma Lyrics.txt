Chomolungma Lyrics
by Alan Parsons.


...How much longer is this going on?
I mean it's rolling on and on and on, sonny!
And now here's a good simple question:.
What year did Cardinal Richelieu die?
1642--that sort of interchange we should be having.
Not these strange... rambling expirations of your own conscious....
Now come along, Sonny.
