Breathless Lyrics
by Swift.

Last night, all smiles: we were holding hands 
And now you won't share the bed with me. 
Explain, if you can 
 
We may not agree on this, but lets not fight 
Because. Who cares? Who is wrong or right? I 
Feel, like i can't breathe like this --. Your 
Grip is too tight, 
 
Taken by surprise, because i felt so secure, 
Because all the things that you've done 
Have. Let me wondering 
 
We may not agree on this, but lets not fight 
Because. Who cares? Who is wrong or right? I 
Feel, like i, can't breathe like this --. Your 
Grip is too tight. 
 
You leave me breathless with your words. 
 
We can say that we've changed together 
Another day. --. Give me your hand. Let me 
Explain, because i've come to terms with 
Who. You are 
, 
We may not agree on this, but lets not fight 
Because. Who cares? Who is wrong or right? I 
Feel, like i can't breathe like this-your grip, 
Is too tight --. Let'S not fight.. Your grip is too 
Is too -- tight, 
 
You. Leave me breathless with your words
