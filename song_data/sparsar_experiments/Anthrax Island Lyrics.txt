Anthrax Island Lyrics
by Swollen Members.


Yo, I'm a cannibal on Anthrax Island.
Dine on my victims swervin' through pylons.
Chamber music, car parked in dungeons.
Stun gun, never sound redundant, funded.
I don't give a fuck, more bang for your buck.
You got shit to talk, you got's dick to suck.
Repent my sins, wipe the prints leave the crime.
Cold-blooded killers with medieval minds.
The sober overdose poems roam like freight trains.
The shit is back on weight gain, powder.
No one man stand prouder.
Pitbull, test a fire of gun powder.

Bright blue speck of light, cause from handstand.
Dime in the jukebox, '65 Mustang.
Pepsi Cola, palm tress, The Fonz.
Mad stab with bayonet, girls spin baton.
Three com platoon, full moon conquer.
Longer, we stay in the lake we grow stronger.
Molotov Cocktail, locked and loaded.
Murder MC's for free with no motive.
Hard time relaxin', not used to taxes.
Sick Vikings roll with crossbow axes.
Bang this bitch plus, who you really down with?
I'm all around the world.
You're on some hangin' down town shit.

Yo, that shit was dope.

Yo thanks Prev, yo rock that shit.

Two steps ahead, too hard to swallow this.
Eye glass reflection tubes of astrologists.
Stars, galaxies, galleries of harm's way.
Front and back row's untamed.
Crucial, using maximum amount of brain.
Grinding the edge of my axe to stay awake.
Lanes shifted, stay at a distance.
Half my with the sentence, hail the viscous.
Double helix, mumbling rejects.
Hear in the rock terrible knuckles our defense.
Buckle under the enormous pressure of my prez.
Since I humble those with even the most eager of intentions.

That you truly have a mind of art.
But your mouth doesn't want to help you out.
When you speak and all you do is spit a line of chalk.
I'm responsible for this, invisible pulsars on the wrist.
What's a wrist, if you don't believe that one exists.
Gases on Venus, dancers in Vegas.
Pull up by them other pits  you can't mistake us.
Eyes full of hunger, strive to pull you under.
Eat a limited circle, speak in energy circles.
Prevail One, The Rob The Viking, Mad Child.
S and M we guaranteed, to breed the call of the wild.
