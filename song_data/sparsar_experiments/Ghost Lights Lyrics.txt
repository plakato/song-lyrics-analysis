Ghost Lights Lyrics
by Woodkid.


Waking up in a world surrounded by flames.
Where everything I liked is about to fade.
How could you be the one if you're not the same.
If in the hands of gods you have.
lost your way.

How ever fast I dance to make the sun shine.
I will never fall down.
No matter what it takes, I'll try to save the ghost lights.
How ever hard I pray to remake you mine.
I will never feel down.
No matter what it takes, I'll try to save the ghost light.

Waking up in the fog, the dust and the pain.
And of the sunny days, no traces remain.
How could you be the one if you sail away.
Without you I can't stand the sound of the rain.
