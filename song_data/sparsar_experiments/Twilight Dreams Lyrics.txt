Twilight Dreams Lyrics
by Voice.

Await in the twilight look up to the sky.
Spread black velvet wings infend to fly.
Feel the slightly warm midsummer night.
Now I am free, I no longer fight.

I'm fkying, I'm flying right across the sky.
When I am tired on a cloud I can lie.
Rise to the stars, over the sea.
I feel immortal, I feel immortal.
And nothing can kill me.

A million stars around observe my way.
Screams in that quietness evoke the judgement day.
Out of breath awaits me the end.
Now I'm free and ready for a better land.

I'm fkying, I'm flying right across the sky.
When I am tired on a cloud I can lie.
Rise to the stars, over the sea.
I feel immortal, I feel immortal.
I'm fkying, I'm flying right across the sky.
When I am tired on a cloud I can lie.
Rise to the stars, over the sea.
I feel immortal, I feel immortal.
And nothing can kill me.
