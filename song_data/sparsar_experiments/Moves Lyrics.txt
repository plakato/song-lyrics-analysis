Moves Lyrics
by Uncut Diamondz.

Lets make moves, I could make moves.
Tell a bitch move, so I could make moves.
Make this whole spot move.
Its moving.
I make moves, I could make moves.
Bitch jocking my moves, ain't stopping these moves.
Make the whole spot move.
Its moving.

Uncut, only right I make hustla music.
Only right I get custom shit, only right that I'm accustom to it.
Only right how I pay dues, and make moves how you supposed to do it.
Lord knows that I know nothing, and need more to learn how to do it.
Make you next move your best move.
This ain't checkers, these chess moves.
Her titties bounce, that's a chess move.
She do that when she try to get to dudes.
To come to her rescue, like pay my shit when the rent due.
I just wanna know what that head do, now bitch move.
Get a couple G's, that's light moves.
Back to chess, I ain't a taking a L that's how a knight moves.
Let me show these niggas how I move.
Only hopping on hot shit, yeah nigga that's fly moves.
1, 2, 3 all these moves I'm counting.
And god said a mustard seed of faith can move a mountain.
And damn these girls keep bouncing, the club watching her ass move.
To you its entertainment, to her she making these fast movesâ€¦

Lets make moves, I could make moves.
Tell a bitch move, so I could make moves.
Make this whole spot move.
Its moving.
I make moves, I could make moves.
Bitch jocking my moves, ain't stopping these moves.
Make the whole spot move.
Its moving.

All I need is power moves to make my day.
All I need is an adlib from Red Cafe.
All I need is a bad chick to move that cake.
All I need is more moves to come my way, hey.
I'm running shit that's a track move.
Steal your chick that's a jack move.
Arch it baby, that's back moves.
I won't lose my tattoos, Wu Tang said cash rules.
So you know I made that move, move it faster than crack move.
Uh, Come tune into my movement.
Need a sponsorship from U-haul how a nigga always moving.
Need a mansion to move in, yup, yup.
And the direction that I'm moving, I'm moving up.
If you ain't moving what you doing, deuces up.
Peace out, I took the piece out, I'm shooting up.
The spot move, now niggas watch what I do.
Niggas jocking these moves, ain't stopping these moves.
I could make the spot move.

Lets make moves, I could make moves.
Tell a bitch move, so I could make moves.
Make this whole spot move.
Its moving.
I make moves, I could make moves.
Bitch jocking my moves, ain't stopping these moves.
Make the whole spot move.
Its moving.
