Rose-Tinted (Bloodshot) Lyrics
by SycAmour.

They'Ll black out the sky and every sin will shift into absence 
Along with the men draped in their genocide. 
Voices will be raised and erased just as quickly 
As. We left ascension, we betrayed our destiny. 
 
I lack description, 
They all cry out. It wasn't me 
Now, forced to see the door that we have opened. 
 
There is no easy way out of this tourniquet 
This compression our transgressions 
Will amass in the clouds high above us 
And mount upon our unexpecting backs. 
 
They won't take us alive 
Mercy's. Only for the wise 
Fall to your knees and quietly accept the fate you've wrought. 
All that's needed for evil to triumph is to do nothing. 
 
I lack description, 
They all cry out. It wasn't me 
Now, forced to see the door that we have opened 
 
Stare into the eyes of beginning and end 
In. Wickedness I've lived in wickedness. I end 
 
They'll black out the sky, 
We descend and captivate your eyes 
Just as we pull them from your skulls. 
You all will burn ... 
You all will burn ... 
 
I lack description, 
They all cry out. It wasn't me 
Now, forced to see the door that we have opened
