Ragin' at Half Mast Lyrics
by 4 Broz By Broz.

J. Rage-a 
They call me J. Rage-a and I keep my shit tight 
Engineer by day journalist by night, 
Been rapping straight up. Since the day I was born, 
Half Mast can vouch. I write lyrical porn 
Make dicks stand at attention can create a monsoon 
In, the deep south region, us two-timers, call'poon' 
But, I'm not here to shock or offend your sensibilities, 
I'm. Looking to increase my lyrical fertility, 
You claim you got the beats that get all the chicks dancin' 
By, the rhymes that you bust, make you sound like Hanson. 
You flow is straight pathetic and your diction reprehensible 
A job for you at K-Mart would be much more sensible. 
But, if you want to run with the biggest and the best 
I, can write all your lyrics help you cheat on the hip hop test. 
The cost of inspiration won't be value. Priced 
My rates will leave you saying: Jesus H.Q. Christ, 
 
MC, Half Mast. 
They call me Half Mast in the hood that I'm from 
A place called The Pines \-. Like one person has a gun 
Make, you shit yourself, Revenge of Montezuma 
Hitting you with rhymes faster than a crippled puma 
Never ate dinner at a place called Dave'n' Busters 
So. Don'T you even ask you motherfucking motherf***ers 
Saving the day just like Batman and Robin 
Boned, eighty bitches and my dick's still throbbin' 
I'm, sometimes called Verizon cause I like to have 4gies 
When five is too much and three is only company 
Don't mind a critique, but I Hate heavy scrutiny, 
You haters, look weak ,'specially. When you start saluting me: 
You, listen to these rhymes there's no way you think they're whack 
Cause. I am running shit, a goddamn turd on this track: 
 
J., Rage-a, 
J., Rage-a and Half Mast rap duel for the ages. 
Bringing wisdom to hip-hop cause. We both be sages 
But, it's time to sign out so sayonara fuckers 
You can't touch these two-timing suckers 
You kiss your mother with that mouth Shit, 
,
