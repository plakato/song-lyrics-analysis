Beethoven Lyrics
by Union J.

It feels like whisky and butterflies.
Like midnight and kisses in the morning light.
Waking up with you here by my side.
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless, so.
I'm tasting sandalwood on your skin.
When it ends I only wanna start again.
I see your name and it's a violin.
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless.
Tonight, tonight, tonight, you are my music.
Move my heart like a metronome.
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I wanna lose it.
I'll be the only song you'll ever know.
Oh oh, oh oh.
I'll play you like an instrument.
Let me be your Beethoven.
Oh oh, oh oh.
Play you like an instrument.
Let me be your Beethoven.
It's like we're caught up in an endless dream.
The clocks don't tick when you hold on to me.
We're keeping the rhythm so perfectly.
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless.
Tonight, tonight, tonight, you are my music.
Move my heart like metronome.
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I wanna lose it.
I'll be the only song you'll ever know.
Oh oh, oh oh.
I play you like an instrument.
Let me be your Beethoven.
Oh oh, oh oh.
I'll play you like an instrument.
Let me be your Beethoven.
Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, you are my music.
Move my heart like metronome.
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I wanna lose it.
I'll be the only song you'll ever know.
Oh oh, oh oh.
I'll play you like an instrument.
Let me be your Beethoven.
Oh oh, oh oh.
I'll play you like an instrument.
Let me be your Beethoven.
