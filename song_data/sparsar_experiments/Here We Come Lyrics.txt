Here We Come Lyrics
by Swollen Members.


We chop it up.
We drop the cuts.
Look out for us.
Cause here we come.
2X.

I'm starting to blow thinking How far can we go?
Work hard for the dough. We dope, but you already know.
We dropping the cut, rock star, chopping it up.
Oh, my god! We stay hard. Never softening up.
And we rocking it rough. Tough 'til my pockets are stuffed.
Love hip hop and clocking the bucks. How can I get enough?
This shit's ridiculous! I say fuck the fickle.
I'm particularly wicked while I kick it with a nickel.
Plated nine so I can hit you in the nick of time.
Hit the nicest I can find. Every night's a different dime.
I was a crazy little devil at a early age.
Been raising hell. Still, I'm trying to reach the pearly gates.
Fuck with my family? I will separate your vertebrae.
That girl was last night. I think I'm taking her today.
I'm having bad dreams. People wanna murder me.
Well, that's the word at least. First, second and third degree.
Shoot first and then ask the questions if there's a burglary.
I'm a bad man. Mad Child: you might have heard of me.

Listen, suckers. Obey the law.
Battleaxe warriors waging war.
Burn the roof off crack the floor.
We used to be kings.
These ain't those days no more.

Not done 'til my group's number one.
'Til I'm proud of what I've done. Another cloud in the sun.
Cause we are better than the rest of them.
That there's the Battle Axe crew. Don't go testing 'em.
A lot of rappers getting on my nerves today.
I told ya, homeboy: gangster's not a word to play.
You hide behind the image without putting in the work.
No wonder why you end up looking like a fucking jerk.
Just because you got a black and gold and sparkly shirt.
With some diamonds on your watch? You ain't never did no dirt!

Interlude:.
Hey yo Mad Child I hear what your sayin' big homie. Prev-one I hear you. A lot.
of these dudes ain't know what ya done.
Battle Axe number one.

Listen suckers obey my orders.
Battle Axe warriors crossing borders.
Rock all sound system not distorted.
The rebel of treble, the bass destroyer.
Take stage world wide we are born performers.
Put your right fist up that means that you can join us.
Appetite for destruction rapid attack is enormous.
