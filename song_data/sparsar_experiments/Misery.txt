Infrared, 
Uh-huh, yea yea uh-huh huh huh huh 
Huh huh, huh, yea, eh, yo, 
 
I went from hoop schemes to loop dreams. 
Sellin to untrue. Fiends to get C.R.E.A.M. is how we do things 
If you, the king, prepare to get down for your crown. 
My niggas go round for round with the clubs or the pound. 
Yea and you know, talk is cheap when you walk these streets, 
You just get caught by the beast and caught up in beef 
But the Blaquesmiths got that shit make me zone out. 
Pull the chrome out blow your bones out. 
Then again. That'S all that. I know. I'M guaranteed to blow 
Cop a phat lab with acres, so my weed could grow 
Infrared Ruthless. That'S all you need to know 
We straight up thoroughbred hard head niggas that don't listen. 
We comin for yo' po-sition, with the fo' spittin 
You, better off snitchin fuckin with the cop 
Cuz. When me copblock your block, we have you thuggin your drops 
This for all my hustlin niggas, stuck in them spots, 
And all my strugglin niggas livin, the hard knock 
To. All y'all niggas think y'all the shit when y'all, not 
Let me tell y'all one thing: we comin for y'all spot 
All, Glocks up life, ain't, just glitters and gold 
When. We pop up y'all niggas, get the jitters and fold 
We hold your block up. You can't stop mine, 
They clock, nine, pull more shots, then wine 
It's our time to shine.
