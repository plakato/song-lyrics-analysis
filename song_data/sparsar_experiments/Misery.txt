Misery
by Ruthless Bastards.

* from the forthcoming The Drama Begins.

Infrared.
Uh-huh, yea, yea, uh-huh huh huh huh.
Huh huh huh, yea, eh yo.

I went from hoop schemes to loop dreams.
Sellin to untrue fiends to get C.R.E.A.M. is how we do things.
If you the king, prepare to get down for your crown.
My niggas go round for round, with the clubs or the pound.
Yea, and you know talk is cheap when you walk these streets.
You just get caught by the beast and, caught up in beef.
But the Blaquesmiths got that shit, make me zone out.
Pull the chrome out, blow your bones out.
Then again, that's all that I know, I'm guaranteed to blow.
Cop a phat lab with acres so my weed could grow.
Infrared, Ruthless, that's all you need to know.
We straight up, thoroughbred hard head niggas that don't listen.
We comin for yo' po-sition with the fo' spittin.
You better off snitchin, fuckin with the cop.
Cuz when me copblock your block, we have you thuggin your drops.
This for all my hustlin niggas, stuck in them spots.
And all my strugglin niggas livin the hard knock.
To all y'all niggas, think y'all the shit when y'all not.
Let me tell y'all one thing, we comin for y'all spot.
All Glocks up, life ain't just glitters and gold.
When we pop up, y'all niggas get the jitters and fold.
We hold your block up, you can't stop mine.
They clock nine, pull more shots then wine.
It's our time to shine.

Blizzard &amp; Sha Gotti together.
Ruthless is the illest, our slugs don't miss.
We pistol-whip the thirteenth nigga and blunts we twist.
The girls that give us head is the girls you kiss.
Come through my hood with a Roly, niggas'll cut off your wrist.

Blizzard.
A bastard is a nigga who ain't got no pops.
I didn't need him, he wan' half when Blizz' ride to the top.
Never that though, high style, eyes low from hydro.
Never pop Crist' or Moe', strictly pop metal.
When you beef with Blizz', the beef is never settled.
Pops never there, so I gotta struggle just to eat.
The beast are tryin to wipe all my hustlers off the streets.
Run up in my crib, to my grandmom's, all types of heat.
Wake my grandpop's up out of his sleep, grabbin me.
From under my sheets and said, You comin with me.
Cuz my crews on top, they tryin to bring us to the bottom.
Give it to a hater who try to cross my path, causin problems.
And the lies, who's involved? I write my hunger over beats and bars.
These niggas wanna see me starve, I gotta get this cheddar.
Can't feed my daughter Wu-Wear and leathers.
The Drama Begins, and I'm bringin it to whoever.

Sha Gotti.
Locked in prison, givin niggas facial incisions.
Gettin head on the V.I. floor, from a pigeon.
Fuckin nymphos, throwin cocktails through niggas windows.
An ounce of weed, two Glocks on the yacht with yo' bi-atch.
Never kill nothin, makin death threats, bull-ets in doors of vets.
Hot lead melt ya sets, stick ya for ya baguettes.
Yo, I blast for this C.R.E.A.M., sippin cash is a dream.
Cash Rules Everything Around My team.
We extortin niggas wildin, smilin on Riker's Island.
Hot slugs'll burn you, whereabouts don't concern you.
Gotti, Black M-O-B, ring on my pinky.
Eyes chinky from hydro smoke, guns we tote.
Cement on your Wally shoes, throw you off the ferry boat.
