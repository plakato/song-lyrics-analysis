Fancy Lyrics
by Wordplay.


First things first, I'm the bestest.
And if you don't think I'm the best rapper then you senile.
And while you hating on me I'll be getting famous in the meantime.
And tbh I'm fucked up.
Walk in the club with my middle fingers up.
I don't care about you and I don't care about them.
So you can save that shit while I turn the fuck up.
They like who dat, who dat. T-O-N-E.
Even a brain dead muhfucka know me.
Back in the 314 and you know I'm with Chris.
Live it up, live it up, vibe like this.
You know I'm Word Play, I gotta do mines like this, aye!

They like who dat, who dat, that's T-O-N-E.
Who dat, who dat, T-O-N-E.
Who dat, who dat, T-O-N-E.
