Party Girls Lyrics
by Rxpture.

Tell me.
Where.
We should go.

Got some niggas.
That are down.
To roll.

And this grade.
Got me.
Thinking slow.

So on you.
I'll take.
It slow.

I know this is unsuaul.
Party settings are new to you.
Alcohol just soothing you.
Oh yeah....

Are you ready?
Mood set just playing R Kelly.
Guess I'm just feelin you.

Party girl so you know your limit.
Watching you.
As you move.
Cause my shades be tinted.

So take time when you grind on me.
Put in work like your minds with me.
Fuck like you have time for me.

Yeah she's gonna give it up cause she knows I do it better.
Yeah she's gonna fill my cup right before till the night ends.
Yeah she's gonna party with my squad and her all friends.
While she's faded.
While she's faded....

Tell me.
Where.
We should go.

Got some niggas.
That are down.
To roll.

And this grade.
Got me.
Thinking slow.

So on you.
I'll take.
It slow.
