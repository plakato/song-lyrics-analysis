Cigarettes in the theatre - live at brixton academy
by Two Door Cinema Club.

It starts in the theater.
A night of encounters.
If I hadn't been there.
If not for a cigarette.
And you could see it change.
Look past the blinding light.
Look past the blinding light.
Just keep talking on.
Tell me your favorite things.
Tell me your favorite things.
Difference in opinion was never an issue.
Collect all your questions.
Cause this time we've all night.
And you could see it change.
Look past the blinding light.
Look past the blinding light.
Just keep talking on.
Tell me your favorite things.
Tell me your favorite things.
And you could see it change.
Look past the blinding light.
Look past the blinding light.
Just keep talking on.
Tell me your favorite things.
Tell me your favorite things.
