See the World Lyrics
by Xazz.


See the world spin around.
Miss the things right in front of you.
See the world spin around.
Miss the things right in front of you.
I'm tired of being alive instead of living.
With nothing to live for.
Live a lie all your life.
Miss the things right in front of you.

Oh but I, I'm gonna live it.
Oh but I, I'm gonna live it.
Oh, see the world.
I, I'm gonna live it.

Instrumental.

Leave no rinses blessed.
Miss the things right in front of you.
Leave no rinses blessed.
Miss the things right in front of you.
Ah oh, I can attain my full potential.
Nothing holding me back.
Throw away your dreams.
Miss the things right in front of you.

Oh but I, I'm gonna live it.
Oh but I, I'm gonna live it.
Oh, see the world.
I, I'm gonna live it.
