I Can't Stop Lyrics
by Ruse.

I walked down to the street.
Watched my mind walk away from me.
I tried to follow.
It's just so hard to see where it's going.
Oh oh oh.
Do you know?
Oh oh oh.
Where did my head go?
Stand back I can't stop.
Stumble off the block.
I can hardly walk.
Stand back I can't stop.
My brain took off in a taxi.
I've got no change to catch a ride.
This space right here draws me near.
My hand is out they look me down.
I'll wait it out it never gets too far.
Oh oh oh.
Do you know?
Oh oh oh.
Where did my head go?
Stand back I can't stop.
Stumble off the block.
I can hardly walk.
Stand back I can't stop.
I just can't shake it and you're taking me no where now.
Oh I can't shake it and you're taking me nowhere no oh.
Stop.
Stumble off the block.
I can hardly walk.
Stand back I can't stop.
