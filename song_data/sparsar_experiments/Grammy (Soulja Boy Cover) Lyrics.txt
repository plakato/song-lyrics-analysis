Grammy (Soulja Boy Cover) Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


What, do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What, do you need from me? Are you not happy with anything 

Party like a rock star hit'em with the hot bars
Fast like a NASCAR lime like my dad's car
I deserve a Grammy? Will I fly away
Or land on Miami? I don't have time to rhyme
But. I do have time to grind

I understand the fans, supply and demand
Crunk on command fight and we'll stand
Lyrics from a true legend livin life through God's blessing
Big papers, long acres, top flight, no security
Black ice on me call the jury
Yeah trick yeah and we call it magic
My style. May change, if you call it drastic
Money so long and we is the measure
I love my business and I love my pleasure
Live now die later. Internet genius
Self proclaimed he a critically acclaimed
For the fortune and fame he'll run through the rain
For, a million in change takin over the game
18 years old, with a drop top Phantom
Kidnap, the world'til they pay. My ransom
DeAndre Way look what's tatted on my face
Four words to say I deserve a Grammy

What. Do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What, do you need from me? Are you not happy with anything 
Is it not good enough 
Am. I not good enough 
Have. I not gave enough 
Tell me: what do you want from me? 

X2
