Self-Motivation Lyrics
by Quarta Quarta.


I'm doing everything i can, just to motivate myself.
It's hard, so i always pray for God to help.
And I trust in the Lord, and not my own understanding.
Cause my own understanding has got, me crash landing.
Like.
I don't know what to do.
And it would be cool if i landed right next to you.
With those pretty brown eyes, and that beautiful smile.
I wouldn't mind if i stayed right here for a while.
You see.
Small things motivate my dreams.
From support i have, to the friends i see.
It all orchestrates, to a melody.
That i listen to when i need some inspiring.
And I'm grinding everyday, for the world to know my cause.
It's worse when you worry 'bout your doubts and your flaws.
As i wonder, if this is the way.
To myself i say.

You have a dream? You better go catch it.
Cause nobody else is going to do it for ya.
You have a dream? You better go and catch it.
Cause nobody else is going to do it for ya.
Always pray. Always grind.
Things you dream, might be what you find.
Working hard just to make innovation.
All i need is self motivation.

It's 2 AM, i love nights like this.
I can write forever, enticed by the pen.
My life is Kingdom Hearts, what does that mean?
That means i value memories more than material things.
I thank God for the times, I told myself.
That only i can do this, and nobody else.
So i got out of my shell, started writing rhymes.
It's all paying off, I'm getting better over time.
Negativity, i will never let it shroud.
Cause one day i hope to make everybody proud.
We have our share of doubts, and our share of flaws.
So we have to have twice as much faith in God.
As time will pass, so will life.
You will reminisce if you did wrong or right.
If you never took a chance, you will never take flight.
And miss the whole view and a beautiful sight.

I made this song to motivate myself.
But i pray, it motivates everybody else.
We can all relate to the times they hate.
People hate when you make what they can't create.
And I know.
There's some people, that want to see me fail.
But they'll never realize that my grind is off the rail.
Working in my room, I'm just trying to shine.
It's easy to lose friends, and easier to lose time.
So whatever you dream, you just got to keep faith.
Work hard enough, and you'll end up in that place.
Cause people will doubt, everything you believe.
If you trust in the Lord, homie you can achieve.
I know it sounds hard, but you know it's not a lie.
You can only succeed, if you actually try.
With my black Half Cabs, and my mind on the win.
I'm about to change the world with a dollar tree pen.
