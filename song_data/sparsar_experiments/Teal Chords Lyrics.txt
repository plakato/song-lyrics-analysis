Teal Chords Lyrics
by Tyler Major.


He's eyein all the rookies.
He's seen it for awhile now and every day its spooky.
Laughin past, seasons ash the hourglass is half the empty.
Next cup---dvd dvr us plus the cassette's stuck.
Never blame the stereo you ballhawk.
Snatch catcher hall of famer passer for the aw shocks.
Write down your secret recipe for the potluck.
And watch national tv pleease no more shots. duck.
\--its for the lighty vixen in the teal chords.
Slide into her wishing well with pennies for her you and yours.
The corner stores dont have it--wrap it in plastic.
Double duties for his fast cars slapsticks.
Thats rich--who you know considered a myth.
Takin trips of all sorts but dont go nowhere but his room and sits.
\--recognize the philosophy.
No matter their whereabouts at the end of the day its just a hypocrisy.

Same moves different day junkies.

Demoness monks bleed papes throughout space.
\---they move with every inching step girating to a lounging pace.
Fully flegeded on the thoughts that they think about him.
Held em to every word held him hostage we've got you surrounded.
They yelled it like it was their very last breath.
If he died at this second his last step would've been the reject.
Ooo geez it kinda got real there.
Life is like a movie shoot--the cameras can't shoot in here.
\--then they move it to a different place.

\---at least thats what i heard them say.
Marry her fountain i heard it drips once every thursday.
Came up with the cake like at the bridal shower.
Indulge in all the eatings of these wannabee rhyming emcees then scour.
