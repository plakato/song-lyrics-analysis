Never Let You Go Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

I'll never let you go.
Never let you go.
I'll hold you tight all night.
I'll never let you go.

I've had my share of heartache and pain.
I've been with users, and losers.
And seen all of their games.
But no one makes me feel the way you do.
There was a time when I was so all alone.
There was no lover, no other.
I could call my own.
But now that I met you.
Those days are through.
I'll never let you go.

I'll keep you on my mind.
Never let you go.
Until the end of time.
I'll hold you tight all night.
Never let you go.

You are the earth and I am the seed.
We'll grow together, forever.
I'll be all that you need.
You and I were always meant to be.
If you should leave.
And go your own way.
I'll still love, I will survive.
But every night I pray.
That you will find your way.
Right back to me.
I'll never let you go.

Day after day and night after night.
I screamed your name and you just came.
Now everything's alright.
Loving you has made my life complete.
When I'm with you.
It's like a dream that's come true.
My emotions start to flow.
My skies are blue and my eyes gaze on you.
And I think that you should know.
I'll never let you go.
