Tell Me Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.

Late nights.
Early mornings....
Make sure the mic right.
Before I go in....
Studio flow spitting nothing really but crack.
Because I'm feigning.
And Dreaming bout riches to be exact.
Yo.
Fuck the fame.
Never looking down.
The top is where I aim....
I bring the pain.
Like that guy Major Payne....
Hold up....
Switch the flow up....
We not the same.
Homie on dope beats I throw up....
I must be a dealer the way these lines shoot up....
All through ya body like a Twelve gauge shoddy in the hood bumping.
killumanti....
Confusing everybody.
Ha, yea I know...
Black male making music.
Instead of selling that snow....
I'm Confusing everybody.
Ha, yea I know...
Black male making music.
Instead of selling that snow....
Let it breath........
Lately I been getting focus.
Going to class fast to avoid the clowns who really just wanna be the jokesters.
Last quarter I was the one.
Getting bad grades then lying to mom when my report card come.
One day she sat me down And said sun.
Your really bright no need to fuss and fight cause you know what's right.
So I'm working every night.
To accomplish a dream.
Wit my team.
You know gotta get by any means....
Nothing.
Without.
Motivation....
Haters say we dey hate dem.
But fuck it we still working.
And never hating...
On another person who working and planning....
Like us.
So why fuss.
With another nigga who not in the picture.
They been cropped out.
How you going school me if you a drop out?
Dirty flows get mopped out when I'm cleaning.
Spitting this dope shit that hip-hop feigning.
When I'm on the mic don't bike cause you can kick it where I stand.
Your bellow me.
Under me is where you stand....
I'm not a baby.
So Please don't hold my hand.
I quickly drown you dry rappers and call it quick sand... Man.
Just another teen chasing man.
I said I'm just another teen chasing man.
