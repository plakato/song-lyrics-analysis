Truman Show Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


Deceit and denial.
What you're looking for can't be found.
Believe me, child.
No bookstore can help you now.
It doesn't have to be loud.
I happen to be up in your face.
Most of the time won't even notice half the bullshit in the place.
All the bad news in your home, classrooms and malls.
And now a quick passage yall.
That I picked up in a bathroom stall.

Save the music.
Erase the evil.
Save the children.
Save the people.
Save the trees.
Natures wealth.
Save the world.
Save yourself.

Better safe than sorry.
Better late than never.
Want to get the props.
Better make the effort.
Don't fall in love with the pinup queen.
Stand right, walk left,.
don't swim upstream.
A to the E, I, O, U.
Sometimes it's Y when the I won't do.
Press 1 for blame.
Press 2 for proof.
But you need to call this number if you need the truth.

We think that we see.
But we don't see the half.
We think that we've learned.
But we can't do the math.
We think that we know.
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go.

We gotta cut the bullshit.
And show the proof.
Rip the tree out of the ground.
And expose the roots.
Cause people love and found.
That we won't improve.
Shit they keep us held down.
As the chosen few.
Just sit, get rich.
What we're going through.
Cause 9-5 slaves slave for.
these corporate fools.
And try to deny and distort the rules.
Inside our minds build cages that force the youth.
In the schools have been trained to ignore the truth.
About the nature of the threat that approaches you.
Before you take another test.
Know the joke's on you.
They only gave you the textbooks to mould your views.
Having with your soul confused.
Some people don't believe they got us on the loose.
Runnin' around chasin' after golden shoes.
Livin their whole lives doin what they told you to.

If I only knew what the way was.
What would I do?
If you knew what you knew could save us.
Would you try to?
Cause we're living in the Truman Show.
There's a limit to what you can know.
Shit it's different than what you've been told.
You've been sold second hand human souls.

We think that we see.
When we don't see the half.
We think that we've learned.
But we can't do the math.
We think that we know.
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go.

We think that we see.
When we don't see the half.
We think that we've learned.
But we can't do the math.
We think that we know.
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go.
