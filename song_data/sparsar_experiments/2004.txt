Yessir Im in the spot, homie 
I'm with some people and I'm hopin that they not phony 
Outside blowin, L's, 
Just copped, forty 
Noise bumpin neighbors gon na call the cops on him. 
Props homie is what they told me: 
My dudes still cop 40's and rock OE's 
Or Colt 45's. But not the gun. 
Cops stop. I run 
Out the window. 
Over fences 
Situation got intenser. I 
Left you hanging 
Oh. Did I forget you 
Or? Did I make you freeze like we stopped for pictures 
Laugh at you and I cheese, just like we stopped for pictures. 
Your prize is a chick and mines. Pulitzer 
My minds just sicker 
I rhyme in pictures 
Deliver in 30 minutes Dominoes 
 Got ta, go we outta here; findin them exotic, hoes, 
I'm, driven and you'd, rather steer 
Sign me here or lose Z like the Cavaliers 
It's TwentyOne. What you have a fear, 
That, I'm animal who fights, bears and battles; deers, don't have a care 
The night passes, but I'm on the inside writing. 
While. My friends is outside of their insides nightly 
Wake up so late. The whole day passed you 
So, unproductive where's, the hustle in it 
Early bird gets the worm, so I'm up at 8 or 9 
Even in the summertime tryna find my latest grind. 
Right less friends could leave you Urkel 
But. I find that best friends just dont leave the circle 
Here's. My angle Ima go in and never come out. 
Bermuda Triangle: 
 
Th th, throw ya mothafuckin hands; 
 
Get Em High 
 
And. I ain't never tell you to put down your L's 
 
Keep Em High 
 
Got, the whole room right. You can tell by the smell 
 
Get Em High 
Hey 
And. I ain't ever tell you to put down your L's 
Keep em high 
 
It's Light
