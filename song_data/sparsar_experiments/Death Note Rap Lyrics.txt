Death Note Rap Lyrics
by VI Seconds.

There are a, couple of live that I'm wishing would end in.
After I go about it I'll take time to repent.
No need for physicalities or actions of a crook.
All I need is a pen and your name within this book.
The confines of these pages hold names of dearly departed.
Have up the gang as of two became and a diction who started.
Light, am I doing this for the light?
I'm not sure I.
Been presented with the power to do God's work.
The people.
Label all my deeds as the work of Kira.
Now I feel as though I'm a killer that they cheer for.
Anyone I deem negative.
Anyone I deem wrong will be dealt with.
With a jot of a name it won't be long before.
Poof they're gone nothing more than a memory.
A power that I may abuse if I choose to make enemies.
And so I watch myself and control my emotions.
Cause a death will come swift with one of my pen's motions.
L, he who does nothing but suspect me.
L, he who does nothing but detest me.
L, he who sticks his nose in my business.
L, he who shall be killed in this instant.
Constantly watching with feels of suspicion.
And proving I'm a murderer seems to be his mission.
But I'm not, I am justice.
I am here to cleanse this planet of it's evils.
I am He in every sense.
Some would say that I may have gone insane with power.
As the random deaths of people increase by the hour.
But, this is just something that had to begin.
This is me helping take the world away from all things.
This is me turning the world to a place without flaws.
This is me taking of the role of... of God.

Ryuk gave me this book for a reason.
For me not to use it is an action of treason.
For me not to take lives of those who waste it.
Well, that's just me trying my own patience.
I'm here to have you lives in my hands.
I'm here to follow every one of God's demands.
I am here to take the lives from those who fight.
God, Kira or Killer.
By the name of Light.
