Give Him the Praises Lyrics
by Virtue.


I've got this praise in me that must come out.
I can't hold it inside there's to much to shout about.
Seein' where I've been and where I am right now I know.
He's brought me through things I couldn't get through on my own.

Give him the praises he deserves.
Let songs of his glory be heard.
Let every voice aloud and without shame.
Let those who know his name praise him.
reapeat.

His majesty so mighty there is no one above him.
And with thanksgiving we enter and begin to.
Lift his name on high worldwide providers strong and true.
Not one of his children have been forsaken by him ooh, I know.

Times I wnated to give up.
Press on and I'm hear today 'cuz.
Everday of my life see.
How he provides for me.
Never left in need.
I know that he's done for you too.
So don't be silent ooh, you need to.

Rejoice and give glory to father.
Because he faileth never.
All of God's children let me hear ya.
Praise him, hallelujuah.
So everybody.
