All Funked Up Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Uuughh?
It's hard to tell up and down anymore.
Uuughh?
All funked up, Yeah we're all funked up.
We're all funked up.

Situation normal.
Ahhhhhhhhh.


All funked up.

Murphy's law will get you, he's on his way.
Oooohhh.
Ooooohhhhh.
We had some leaders, and they were cheaters.
Situation normal.
Tornados spinning, I sit here grinning.
I think we've all seen this movie before.

This is confusing, almost amusing.
Same old same old shit a different day.
We should reject them, but we respect them.
Nothing in this world a simple man can do.

For what they do when the door is closed.
Don't you know the meaning of the word snafu.



We're funtionally disfuntional.

We're all funked up.
We're funtionally yeah disfuntional.
All funked up, we're all funked up.
When did it get so crazy, how did we lose control.
Stand up and be counted, hadn't you had enough.
All funked up, We're all funked up.
Everybodies shouting, how bad it really sucks.

Better known as trouble for me and you.
We're all funked up.
But they came out smelling like a rose.
Oh?

Situation normal.
