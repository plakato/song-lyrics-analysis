Glistening Black Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

A great blue whale where as it lives in the water.
Eagle bone hollow...life in the sky.
Whistle bone.
Pipe stone.
The heart of man is a throne.
Wild wild wild he carries the child home.
Heaven hands high.
Freedom heaven hands high.
There is no bird...in the sky.
Who can fly...who can fly on by.
To this place of quiet.
This fires repose.
In heavens hand high it glows.
In heavens hand high it glows.
One for the many.
Made straight the way.
You ask me for darker things.
Of the hardened road.
The crooked row hoed.
All shod in shame I wager.
You'll be dazed by the serious nature....
From La Junta on to Rocky Ford.
Rocky boy rocky boy rocky boy know the Lord.
What can she do but say yes.
To the black of the wild.
Confide and confess.
Freedom heaven's hand high.
One for the many.
Brought down town.
Every high brow.
Every thought of justice.
Of just deserved a dead man's curve.
Our thoughts are burning trust us.
He made straight away.
Straight the way a level plane.
Straight the way a level plain.
In the silver darkness.
Glistening black.
His shadow glows.
To cover and clothe.
To set at right...the fire of light.
Reeling drunken on the earth.
Unbelief weighing upon it.
My mind in your hand.
In the lion's heart...I the lamb.
Heaven hands high.
Freedom heaven hand's high.
Make straight the way.
