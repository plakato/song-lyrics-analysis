Love (I Don't Need It Anymore) Lyrics
by The Union.

Morning light lands on her face.
As another day begins.
In her eyes, there's a story of a lover.
Who's been disappointed once again.
So she combs her hair, she'll wash her face.
Sing her favorite song as she forces out a smile.
Now the song's the same but her world has changed.
And everything she held so dear it's all on trial.
She said, Love, I don't need it anymore.
She said, Love, it lies in pieces on the floor.
Love, I don't need it anymore.
She said, Love, it keeps walking out that door.
Daydream weaver paints a picture perfect in her mind.
Make believe, the author of a story.
Where the ending always turns out fine.

So she takes a drag of a cigarette.
With her head in her hands she keeps askin' why.
All the bad luck comes as good love goes.
She's cryin' up a river but that river's about to run dry.
