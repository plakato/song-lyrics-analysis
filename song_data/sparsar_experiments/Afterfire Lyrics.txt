Afterfire Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

We have been waiting for you, anticipating you.
We shall not lose faith in all that is heaven.
And heaven is such a small place.

Seconds to minutes to hours to days.
Screaming for something that's something I will never hold.
All around you is tinder for the Gods.

Seconds to minutes to hours to days.
Screaming for something that's something I will never hold.
All around you is tinder for the Gods.
Storms across the battlements, the afterfire.

All around you is tinder for the Gods.
Storms across the battlements, the afterfire.

All around you is tinder for the Gods.
Storms across the battlements, the afterfire.
