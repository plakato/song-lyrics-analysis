Don't Even Try Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


People wondering why I flip it up high now.
Well maybe cause this world has been flipped upside down.
Fuckers get up right now, at attention and listen up right now.
But all I see is twitching of the eyebrows.
Cause when shit gets serious, it's time to duck and run.
Like This a stick up! by some fuckers from Compton.
With long guns like fuck arms control, it's over yo.
We live and prosper off assault rifles.
While they over there on welfare like.
Where's my money, bitch?
'Till I kill the government and then spend it on honey dips.
Yeah, suck it trick, have it 'till I panic, go manic.
And bust a nut all over this whole entire planet.

I've had it with you backstabbing assholes.
I'm maxed out on that yo, but I'm loading up my ammo.
Preppin' to blast at you in case of attack.
Leave you shadows of the past.
Then switch my last name to Castro.

You will never change the way that our people ride.
So don't fall victim and believe a lie.
Now jot notes on my advice, don't even try.

This shit's getting hectic, my motherfucking objective.
Your neck, you better protect it.
But all attempts end pathetic.
And if I said it, you know I meant it.
Never empathetic.
Cause I am so fucking disconnected from this world.
I've been ejected like fighter pilot cockpit.
You should try to widen optics.
While I lie a silent promise.
And pay the Pied Piper homage.
I'm gone, full throttle, Autobahn.
Like I'm living on the run.
Olympic competition won.
'Till I fuck around and drink from a fountain.
Oh, this Sochi?
It's so cheap that it's eating out my mouth.
And this allowed?
It's absurd the shit that occurs.

A poor man snatching your purse.
A whore raped who was laughing at first.
It happens, you heard?
So yeah, don't fret, Big Brother's in town.
And he's here to bring the motherfucking troublesome down.
