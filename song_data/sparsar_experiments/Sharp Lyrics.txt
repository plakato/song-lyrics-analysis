Sharp Lyrics
by The 3rd Kind.


I'm feeling real good right now man.
It's close encounters of The 3rd Kind.
See I'm a son of a gun, it's the JaY STEEZ.
I'm a son of a gun, and a master of every trade under the Sun.
I talk sharp like a razor bladed under the tongue.
Ya feel me?

Huh, and 4 – 3 – 2 – 1.
I'm the BlaKK JaKK homie, such a son of a gun.
And I mastered every trade under the Sun.
I talk sharp like a razor blade.

Let's go!
Look.
You can't see me with the rhetoric, I be the best to spit.
Respect the regiment or fail like the rest of them.
And hadn't you win it.
Back when Wayne dropped a Carter III.
So start beef, and get washed.
And hang out like laundry.
I let you tumble dry.
Cats ain't touching mine.
I always had a troubled mind.
Equipped with some subtle lines.
Busting rhymes, couldn't touch it and bring it.
The word play is making cats wanna crutch for they triggers.
So, somebody call the cops, you gotta semi auto cocked.
Rocko got soul, with drive like an auto shop.
Your orthodox can't compare to my south paw.
I'm bout more, my sounds raw, and sound waves pound floors.
So if you switch stance, I got quick hands.
JaY STEEZ holds his own like kick-stands.
In simple terms, I'm the illest with these written words.

Hearse.

I'm a son of a gun, it's the JaY-STEEZ.
I'm a son of a gun, and a master of every trade under the Sun.
I talk sharp like a razor blade is under the tongue.

Huh, wuh and 4 – 3 – 2 – 1.
I'm the BlaKK JaKK homie, such a son of a gun.
And I mastered every trade under the Sun.
I talk sharp like a razor blade.
Like a razor blade.

I be The Rhymer, and I'm known to rip it off the noggin.
Rhymes crackle and vomiting listings often nodded?
The brain is lost to find it off smoking cough and something.
JaKK &amp; STEEZ will take over.
Time, but we exhaust that option.
Plus the flow will never stay the beginner.
