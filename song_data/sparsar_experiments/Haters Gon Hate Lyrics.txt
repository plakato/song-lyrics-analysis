Haters Gon Hate Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


When I pull up at the club in a big black.
Truck on dubs.
Cause I'm doing big thangs, and I got a lot of ice.
In my chain.
When I come through the door, and take all the hoes.
I know.
Cause I'm playing with some chips, and I make a lot of hits.
I know.

Curren$y.
I don't know if it's the Porsche or the Lamb, that make these niggas.
Hate me, like I'm a member of the Klu Klux Klan.
I mean god damn, how much money I got in my hand.
Really don't concern you man.
But I know why you niggas boot me up.
Cause I come through pushing brand new Coupes and stuff.
You say you wanna shoot me up.
Because I got a pair of Jordans won't be out for at least two months.
They call me Curren$y the Hot Spitter.
And that's cause I keep my money, in stacks.
I know they got hatas out to jack niggas.
So that's why I ride, with my gat.
A Glock and a mask in the dash of the Jaguar, and that's a X-K-8.
And if you cross me, you'll die dog.
So I advise y'all, please don't hate.

When I walk in the club and the bitch.
Touching bread starts smiling.
When I buy the bar, hit the flo' just start wilding.
You feel that.
When them tires on the Navi just keep on spinning.
Look at that shit man.
In the club thugged out, with my P. Miller denim.
Nigga see that.

Krazy.
With a high rich I get I.
still remember, the bad times.
In the Ville rock hustling, with a loaded nine.
All the niggas said I'd never make it, be friends now.
All the dick-riders see this bitch, take a while.
All the hoes that never liked me, wanna fuck me.
I'll two-way you for some head, you can trust me.
It must be this tank, or the shiny gold teeth.
Make these hoes get wet, everytime I speak.
These streets I push weight, silent nigga.
Unless you turn me into a, violent nigga.
Smiling in my face, nigga hate behind my back.
And you wonder why these bitch ass niggas get smacked.
No fear of the police, only the feds.
Catch him snitch late night, I'll bust his head.
No love for these hating niggas, or the informants.
Ask bank run about me, my account's enormous.

When I'm walking through the mall, I'm chilling with my dogs.
Or my girl.
I don't even notice nigga why you spoke to this.
Nigga got a choke me a hater.
This 8 is beginning this 8,.
no gimmick.
This the New No Limit.
And all the ladies love Choppa, cause they know.
He's such a poppa but all.

Choppa.
Niggas gonna hate no matter what you do.
So if you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you.
And I could care less, who did what with who.
See I love when you hate, so do what you do.
Rolaid, I understand that's your crew.
But them cats ain't got no love for you.
Y'all wonder why, your careers and you died.
Cause your songs sound the same, like you doing a lie.
Don't wanna do nothing else, then shake the streets.
That's why I'm glad big rap gave a dang to me.
And my nigga Master P gave the flame to me.
Making hits after hits, what it came to be.
Not just a boss rapper, but a hot m.c.
All them other niggas sound like me, think about it.
I'm Choppa, that Westbank show stopper.
If you sick of me, then nigga go see a doctor.

When I pull up at the club in a big black.
Truck on dubs.
When I buy the bar, hit the flo' just start wilding.
You feel that.
This 8 is beginning this 8, no gimmick.
This the New No Limit.
Cause I'm playing with some chips, and I make a lot of hits.
I know.
