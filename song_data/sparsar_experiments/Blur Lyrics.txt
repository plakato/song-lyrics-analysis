Blur Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


Woah-oh-oh-oh.
Woah-oh-oh-ohhh.

Yeah it's been a Blur.
I've been throwing Stone Roses.
Sipping on my Oasis.
Feeling like the Verve.
The drugs don't work.
Only if you're Fred Durst.

Pocket half empty but I'm living to.
the fullest.
When I've had a shot, I think I can dodge bullets.
If you wanna rock, tell me you love The Killers.
I might give you a job, you'll be working on our business.
Just call me Lord Sugar, the sweetest that you been with.
I'll never fire you, you'd be too hot to extinguish.
I deal with power moves, checkmate, game finished.
The trick is not to lose, that's the only way you're winning.
I know I'll never give in, yeah, cause I've survived mosh pits.
With some super fly drop kicks.
Only my chains swinging, yeah, cuh I ain't into boxing, no.
I dont bob and weave women.

Yeah, yeah.
Ain't it funny how your nightmares.
Can turn into your dreams, yeah?
Yeah it's been a Blur.
And it happens so fast.
That you just can believe it.
Yeah it's been a Blur.
I've been throwing Stone Roses.
Sipping on my Oasis.
Feeling like the Verve.
The drugs don't work.
Only if you're Fred Durst.
Yeah it's been a Blur.

I do it my way.
I'm a little too heavy for you lightweights.
I drink 'til my baby gets a migrane.
And then my head starts to rumble, this is mind games.
This is how my life stays.
That's how I stay ahead of myself.
My attitude stinks, I can smell it as well.
If you always get love you know how Federer felt.
You can get around a waist, just pretend you're a belt.
And I ain't claiming to be free.
For the past few months I've been raving every week.
Started off a nightmare, then it changed into a dream.
Now I like my music loud, can you turn it up for me?

Yeah it's been a Blur.

Yo, Wretch, you ready?

Aw yeah.

Woo.

We don't want a Panic at the Disco.
We just wanna live our life.
But if you Blink 182 then your life.
Will just pass you by.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah it's been a Blur.
Yeah it's been a Blur.
