Be Good to You Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


I'll never hurt you.
Oh!
And you will never shed a tear for me.

I know you're tired of.
Being in and out of love.
With nothing to show.
And nowhere to go, but.

Back to the same one.
Only with a different face.
But now you are in a different place.
And if my words don't comfort you.
Time will surely prove.
That I'll do just what I say.

I'll only be good to you.

Be like I should to you.

Be everything.
To you bring you nothing but the good stuff.
I'll give you good love.

I'll only be good to you.

Be like I should to you.

Be everything to you.
Said I'll be good to you.
Only be good to you.

You say it's too good to be.
Too good.
And I agree that the way it seems.

Except for my instinct.
Telling me it's something else.
It's not a rebound or playground.
But something that's real.

I've got so much to give you.
So don't you dare hesitate to receive it.
If my words don't comfort you.
Time will surely prove.
That I'll do what I say and more.

I'll always be there when you fall.
Never doubt my heart at all.
It's you that I've chosen.

You are my focus.
And this ain't no phony disguise.
You can see if you look down deep.
They'll be nothing but good love.
Good love coming from me.
Oh.
