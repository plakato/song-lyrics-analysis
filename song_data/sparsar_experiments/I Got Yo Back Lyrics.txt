I Got Yo Back Lyrics
by X-Raided.


If you wanna get high, nigga I got a sack.
If you wanna ride, my nigga I got a strap.
Do or die for my true thug niggas, and that's a fact.
You and I got that true love, nigga I got yo back.

Don't nobody got your back, when you need 'em most.
I'm yellin' where the love at? But you don't hear me loc.
Sometimes I think I'm goin' down, I need a life preserver.
But you throw me bricks, tryna help me drown.
But I survived, what other options do I have?
Can't blame it on my Mom, can't blame it on my Dad.
I make my own decisions, I chose the path that I walk.
But me and my father never had that man to man talk.
But there ain't no need for me to hate him.
He did me a favour when he caught my mama ovulatin'.
He brought me in the world, and the rest is up to me.
So I'm a, do what I gotta and be all that I can be.
Now I wanted to be a doctor, a lawyer, or a judge.
But it wasn't meant to be so now I got a grudge.
I was ... for persistence when I asked for persistence.
You kept me at a distance, so fuck all you bitches.
I don't need none of y'all, I'm a do it on my own.
And when I'm ballin', I'm a floss in front of all y'all non-believers.
You thought I couldn't win.
But to my homies, my lovers, and my friends.
I got ya back.

When everybody got they noses up in the air.
I'll be there for you, lettin' you know your nigga cares.
I ain't got much to offer but you welcome to what I have.
Down to ride witcha, even when the homies mad.
I be down witcha; winter, spring, summer, fall.
I'm ready to ride every time that my homie calls.
I never stall on ya dawg, through it all, thick or thin.
We went from boys to men in the same hood.
So it's all good, even when you actin' bitchmade.
It's still on, I'm a ride when you right or wrong.
Standin' strong, no matter what the situation in.
And if you die, will provide for your wife and kids.
That way you live, forever.
However, a nigga's never gonna let 'cha rest in peace till we back together.
Fuck restin' in peace, I'm in an up roar.
What other reason does a nigga have to live for?
If you ain't ready to ride for what we believe.
Then get the fuck out the game, it's time for you to leave.
Cuz only niggas is willin' to put it all on the line.
And ride with us when it's killin' time.
I got yo back loc.

X-Raided mad at the world, ready to go to war.
So tell me what y'all mothafuckas waitin' for?
Put on your boots, and lace 'em up.
Dawg, tell me which tree you wanna chase 'em up.
It's an organized congregation, committee of the wicked.
If you ain't ready to ride, then nigga you can't kick it.
So get the fuck up out the set, you high powered coward.
Before your bitch ass get devoured.
At any given hour my soldiers is bound to loc up.
The warriors gonna ride, and all you bitches gon' choke up.
But that's the only way to separate the real from the fake.
Don't ask me why, bitch a bitch ....
That Northern Cali kill 'em all mentality.
It ain't my fault, blame it on the criminality.
I'm out to make the paper stack.
And when my homie calls, hell yeah it's a conspiracy.
I got his back.
