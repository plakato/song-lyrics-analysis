I Got Yo Back Lyrics
by X-Raided.


If you wan na get high nigga. I got a sack 
If you wan na ride, my nigga. I got a strap, 
Do or die for my true thug niggas and that's a fact. 
You and I got that true love nigga. I got yo back 
 
Don't. Nobody got your back when you need'em most 
I'm yellin', where the love at, But you don't hear me loc 
Sometimes, I think I'm goin' down. I need a life preserver 
But, you throw me bricks. Tryna help me drown. 
But, I survived what other options do. I have 
Can't blame it on my Mom can't blame it. On my Dad. 
I make my own decisions. I chose the path that I walk. 
But me and my father never had that man to man talk 
But there. Ain'T no need for me to hate him. 
He did me a favour when he caught my mama ovulatin' 
He brought me in the world and the rest is up to me. 
So, I'm a do what I got ta and be all that I can be 
Now. I wanted to be a doctor, a lawyer or a judge 
But. It wasn't meant to be so now I got a grudge. 
I was ... for persistence. When I asked for persistence, 
You kept me at a distance, so fuck all you bitches 
I, don't need none of y'all, I'm a do it on my own 
And, when I'm ballin', I'm a floss in front of all y'all non-believers. 
You thought I couldn't win 
But to my homies, my lovers and my friends. 
I got ya back 
 
When everybody got they noses up in the air. 
I'Ll be there for you lettin'. You know your nigga cares. 
I ain't got much to offer, but you welcome to what I have 
Down to ride witcha, even when the homies mad 
I be down witcha
