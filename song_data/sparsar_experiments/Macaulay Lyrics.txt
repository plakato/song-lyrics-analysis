Macaulay Lyrics
by Quiet Desperado.

He's all alone in this world like Hodgy Beats said.
Macaulay Culkin's sulkin because his parents are dead.
Checked his entire house, not one person in bed.
His stomach starts to turn, he didn't wish they had fled.

Put on the aftershave, feel the afterburn.
Visit your parent's grave, decomposing with worms.
Christian's come to save, Salvations what he yearns.
Messing with dead is brave, necromancy is learned.
Bring em' back as slaves, townspeople gettin' concerned.
Zombies they must behave, Or their lives are adjourned.

Self-made bastard severing family ties.
Became polyamorous, so I could have 3 wives.
When I have yellow fever, I put it in Chau Knives.
You in the stomach and leaves you to die.
Like an American Psycho, I'll Bale and impale.
A homeless guy right above the navel.

Talk weird, act white.
Write well, overbite.
Bad skin, flow right.
Does it rhyme? It just might.
