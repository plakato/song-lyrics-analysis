The Sermon (Interlude) Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..

The album cover is not meant to be blasphemous.
But it is meant to be controversial and adversarial.
2Pac screams ‘Fuck the World!'.
Yet cares enough to make albums to speak for the poor.
Jesus says “My Kingdom is not of this world”.
Yet dies on the cross for this world his Father loved.
Only those who can truly reject the way things are.
Can be prepared to love so deeply.
As to die for the way things can be.
To hold up Middle fingers to the sin that exists in all of us.
Including ourselves.
And yet open their arms wide enough to be slain.
For the most undeserving of all of us.
Is prepared to be a Saint.
Many are called but chosen are few.
Will you make the cut?
