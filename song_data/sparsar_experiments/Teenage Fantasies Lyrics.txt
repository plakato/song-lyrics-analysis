Teenage Fantasies Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.


See fantasies are the only things that give us hope.
So if you have fantasies like I do, vibe to this shit right here.
It's gon' give you hope.

When you are a teen, everybody has that one damn dream.
Everybody wanna be famous or rich, so they get hitched to the got damn dream.
Man I don't know why though, I believe I can fly though.
Sometimes I wonder if these dreams are too high to reach though.
But they're never too high my nig.
So fuck y'all haters my nig.
Y'all say y'all hate me my nig.
But y'all secretly loving the kid.
So please make up y'all damn minds.
We really don't have time.
I'm praying that I blow up.
So my dreams can land, do you mine.

Teenage fantasies, I got fantasies.
You got fantasies, we all have these fantasies.
Teenage fantasies, what you wanna be.
Teenage fantasies, I know you have these fantasies.
Teenage fantasies, I got fantasies.
You got fantasies, we all have these fantasies.
Teenage fantasies, what you wanna be.
Teenage fantasies, I just wanna be.

I wanna be the best, is that too much to want.
Aye mom, I'm sorry for the lies, from now on I'm blunt.
I might smoke weed just to ease this stress.
I did smoke weed just to ease this stress, damn.
Can't believe I said that but when you too high you confess.
Fuck that, I never wanna come down.
Cause I like it up here.
Please don't blow my high cause it's nothing to do down there.
When I'm up here, I have no fears.
Frowns turn around when I'm chilling with my peers.
Too much fun leads to the tears.
But the tears are the reason why we grind every year.
