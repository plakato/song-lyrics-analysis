A Junkie's Blues Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.

I still have questions with no answers.
I'm alive... but I'm not living.
I don't have much time left....
I just know this:.

I've lived a violent life.
I might as well be dead.
I just want to sleep forever.
And forget....
Forget....

It's more than physical, love unconditional.
Anything else is like a Band-Aid.

So you cover your bleeding wounds.
So the dogs won't smell you coming.
There may be time... and.

But what if it never changes?
And what if I wasn't to blame?
What if it never gets any better... than this?

What if I wasn't to blame?
What if I could change?
Yeah, what if I could change?

What if I'm only insane?
