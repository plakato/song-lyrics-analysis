Power In Attention Lyrics
by Aziz.


This is my perspective.

You see, there's power in the dollar, but power is in attention.
You got power over your words, then maybe you'll hold a sentence.
Power to project who in your circle would protect you.
Who would you die for? Nigga pay attention.
This is my show. I thank you for your admission.
I know the kitchen, cook up this uplifting so efficient.
I hold attention, the people listen.
So here go some preacher, some prophet, and some politician.

Step one: you can't mumble, and.
don't stumble.
Speak up. Don't be quiet, you fumbled in the cipher.
Gotta come back behind steel bars like a lifer.
Not all sweet, put thorns in your berries like Eliza.
High flyer-rhymer, young Tutankhamun rhymer.
Pay attention, when you in the cipher.
I see a significant difference between gangster and fables.
I've been around enough G's to know one.
They listen, they know son go off like a show gun.
Cracked bat, home run, PSA attention.
You spit, nobody listens.
And that's the difference.
I'm a magician when I'm politicking, twisting.
Try and stop cyclones.
Yeah, they're so Popeye Jones.
And their ears are getting bigger, you so Popeye's chicken.
Chicken's eyes pop at potential Popeye's spinach.
Pay attention and listen.
Working hard as a genius.
I won't just sit here dropping knowledge for no reason.
I'm not wasting my breathe, so I'm leaving, on me.
To off-time lame rappers please quit, on three.
How bad can New Hampshire be if it produced me?
I'm Aziz. Who's he?
He's the ‘A' then the zig-zag.
‘I' and then the zig-zag.
Jengsala clique rap.
Blow the joint up like a zig-zag.
Give me your attention.
You fuck with it?

Ha.

Then tell me and my niggas.
I should probably win the Nobel Peace, and Pulitzer.
Paint pictures.
Perfect images of thoughtful penmanship.
Akin to novels.
Hopefully it's enough to hold attention.
I'll tell u why I'm different.
I've been at this for a minute.
This didn't pop out the blue, like my rap career Cripping.
Beyond my years, 9 year old, little dude ripping.
Beyond my peers always gifted with the Gift of Gab.
I guess I see why they say I sound like that nigga Fab.
I mean, I had the chipped tooth and that's compliment and all.
But I'm Aziz.
Drive my lane like I'm bouncing with the ball.
Rap is alcohol, got a couple Alch-ies in the hall.
They're bouncing off the walls.

Give me your motherfucking attention.

Only way that I'ma fall is if the month is October.
Intoxicating words, under 21 is not sober.
Leave a stain like your brain was the carpet, and red wines what I knocked.
over.
Open doors just like a lock smith.
Put niggas on like my snap back.
My moods go up and down like my tube socks.
I need family.
I should call my pops over, he from Senegal that's the roots.
My mother was born and raised in Germany to boot.
Ya ganow danke shun, racing on the Autobon.
Got 100 first cousins I'ma put all em on.

Last thing I'ma be is ignorant, uninformed.
As an artist it's like, “What I.
wanna draw?” A Hundred bars?
You could provoke a nigga til a gun will draw.
Word wars.
A little cocky but I stay humbled more.
I want to tour.
Our lives will change once I catch the right persons attention.
If hip-hop is crack this is my verbal intervention.

I'll never conform and wear a lames uniform.
Surround myself with positive and pray success will match it.
Yeah.
My news feed said there are 10 new rappers.
I have never seen them rapping.
Fuck, I need action. Fuck.
Let me hear your freestyles.
Let's me see you hold another nigga's attention with your personal style.
Let's see if you stay in pocket, flow confident and versatile.

I'm the game's latest child.

I hold attention no denial.
I flow marathons.
Brim low iTunes. Brim low Amazon.
MAC. Sign us.
Labels, dotted line us.
Coke lines, everybody knows  like sinus.
They pay . If you listen you're going to like us.
If you're fresh as a Stride, I'll chew you up like five gum.
A salaam aluyakum. wa alaykum a salaam.
La ilaha lll Allah and Muhammad was his prophet.
I believe it.
I'm the one, I was built for this position.
Not for gluttony, but just to keep something on the table.
I gotta get the shrubbery, Anne of green gables.
Man, Aziz is able.
Locked loaded for the millions.
White, black, purple, yellow, green people feeling this.
Man.
My friends in the family.
Our hearts are in the handshake.
I use my hands to write, if you dap me watch hand break.
If you use your hands to fight, you better make a nigga pancake.
I'm about love and good vibes, with some other good guys.
And some other hood guys.
Know-my-mother good guys.
Late night I be on that pass the rubbers good night.
This generations parents got some cake like they should, right?
Is it wrong if they did right?
Should I transform into King Kong or Suge Knight.
Or should I deliver truth and honesty to hold the crowds.
I can mold my mouth and sentence it to life behind a mic.
I'll do techno, rock, rap if it sounds to me right.
We all know a lame when we see one.
Y'all could be millionaires like I'ma be if you believed you could be one.
Nigga, give me your attention.

Aziz.
