Daddy Bear Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Keep your hands to yourself.
It's so easy.
To mistreat history.
You're a thorn in my side.
Just a drone to the hive.
One goal, hidden in the trees.
It's the sting of love that I missed.
It's too late I'm already up to my wrist.
With the buzz that keeps me coming back.
When the buzz buzz keeps me coming back.
I never meant to steal your honey.
Cause it ain't worth the tears.
Too sweet to keep me running.
Cause I'm your daddy bear.
The owl was right.
It's an upward fight.
A hundred acres in my mind.
Small, Early, and Late.
All reasonable names.
The rabbit is the one to blame.
Can't keep my paws off you.
These hives all look the same.
I'm stuck on you.
You're stuck to me.
Together we'll make history.
I never meant to steal your honey.
Cause it ain't worth the tears.
Too sweet to keep me running.
Cause I'm your daddy bear.
