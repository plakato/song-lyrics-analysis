Back To The Old House Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

I would rather not go back to the old house.
I would rather not go back to the old house.
Too many memories, bad memories.
Too many memories there.

When you cycled by, here begin all my dreams.
The saddest thing I've ever seen.
And you never knew how much I really liked you.
Cause I never even told you, I meant to.

Are you still there?
Or have you, moved away.
Or have you moved away?

I would love to go back to the old house.
But I never will.
I never will.
I never will.
