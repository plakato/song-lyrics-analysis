Octopus Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

Trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro', you have no word.
Trip, trip to a dream dragon, hide.
your wings in a ghost tower.
Sails cackling at every plate we break.
Cracked by scattered needles the little minute gong coughs and clears his.
throat.
Madam you see before you stand, hey ho, never be still.
The old original favorite grand, grasshoppers green Herbarian band.
And the tune they play is In Us.
Confide.
So trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro', you have no word.
Please leave us here, close our eyes to the octopus ride!

Isn't it good to be lost in the wood.
Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood.
Meant even less to me than I thought.
With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds.
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed.

Well, the madcap laughed at the man on the border, hey ho, huff the Talbot.
Cheat he cried shouting kangaroo, it's true in their tree they cried.
Please leave us here, close our eyes to the octopus ride!

Please leave us here, close our eyes to the octopus ride!

The madcap laughed at the man on the border, hey ho, huff the Talbot.
The winds they blew and the leaves did wag.
They'll never put me in their bag, the seas will reach and always seep.
So high you go, so low you creep, the wind it blows in tropical heat.
The drones they throng on mossy seats, the squeaking door will always squeak.
Two up, two down we'll never meet, so merrily trip forgo my side.
Please leave us here, close our eyes to the octopus ride!
