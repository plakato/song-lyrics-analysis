From Where You Are Lyrics
by Wolf Rider.


Will the stars in the sky tonight.
Make you feel like there is no time.

And if the world spins upside-down, don't worry.
It's just a ride.
And if you lose yourself, don't worry.
I'll see you on the other side.

From where you are.

See the goal.
Is to live our life fast.
Will you become.
Famous at last.

Hold on, it's almost over.
You can feel it coming closer.
