After Midnight Lyrics
by Yuna.

After midnight I shall kidnap you from the world.
And I'll keep you in my room.
Hush now my love and hold my hand.
After midnight I shall take you to a place.
Where no one else should know of.
Hush now my love and hold my hand.

You are exactly where you supposed to be.
And if they come for you.
They would have to find me.

Stay.
Keep me awake.
Keep me amazed.
Only for today.
Keep me dazed.
My love is yours only.

After midnight.
I shall stay awake.
And if you chose to close your eyes now.
Hush now my love.
I'll watch you sleep.

You are exactly where you supposed to be.
And if they come for you.
They would have to find me.

Stay.
Keep me awake.
Keep me amazed.
Only for today.
Keep me dazed.
My love is yours only.

Stay.
Keep me awake.
Keep me amazed.
Only for today.
Keep me dazed.
My love is yours only.
