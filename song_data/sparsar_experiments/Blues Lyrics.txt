Blues Lyrics
by Two-9.


It ain't nothing on the news but the blues.
Sorry mama, but your baby got the blues.
Hit the block and he got nothing but the tool.
Gotta fix shit, I'ma fix shit.
It ain't nothing on the news but the blues.
Sorry mama, but your baby got the blues.
Hit the block and he got nothing but the tool.
I'ma fix shit, watch me fix shit.

Fucked up politicians, cops with all that killing.
Banging on the youngins, think they dying just from living.
College tuition more expensive than a prison.
Get paid more in jail, but they think my youngins trippin'.
I'ma go to war just to get some more.
My little brother sell it, he don't trust the law.
Get less time for a shooting than for selling hard.
But how my nigga gone feed his baby boy? It's all bad.
All bad, get high and then it's combat.
Who want that? Aw yeah.
It's fucked up like prison systems.
Fuck the system, I'm gone pimp it.
If I'm broke, Bob the Builder.
With the tool, I'm gone fix it.

It ain't nothing on the news but the blues.
Sorry mama, but your baby got the blues.
Hit the block and he got nothing but the tool.
Gotta fix shit, I'ma fix shit.
It ain't nothing on the news but the blues.
Sorry mama, but your baby got the blues.
Hit the block and he got nothing but the tool.
I'ma fix shit, watch me fix shit.

They say we living in hell, so bring your sunblock.
Cops keep a gun cocked, they making lungs stop.
For a traffic ticket, tragic, all I ask is were you John Madden.
On the block, with the rock, like Dwayne Johnson.
Hot boy, I got hot toys.
If it's 12 around, then let it pop boy.
I got bail on me now, take that shit to trial.
Brian Nichols to a bailiff, I'ma knock him down.
Judge gavel, I don't make a sound.
Silence for my youngins, RIP to Mike Brown.
This that block talk.
Face down outline, then the chalk talk.
Ain't made out a cop car, cause.

It ain't nothing on the news but the blues.
Sorry mama, but your baby got the blues.
Hit the block and he got nothing but the tool.
Gotta fix shit, I'ma fix shit.
It ain't nothing on the news but the blues.
Sorry mama, but your baby got the blues.
Hit the block and he got nothing but the tool.
I'ma fix shit, watch me fix shit.
