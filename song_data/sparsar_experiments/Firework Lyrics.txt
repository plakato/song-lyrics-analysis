Firework Lyrics
by Quan Millz.


Cloud Nine, Forever Winning.
I gave you what you wanted, I'm a legend like will.

Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.

Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.
Light em like a firework.

Looking like a million, fresh up out that corner store.
Spitting fire like a dungeon dragon.
Rolling in that bugatti, while you drifting with a wagon.
People tell me differently But I'm one that's tagging, It's you the one we.
laughing at.
You just spit that game, and I'mma win your money back just like how you took.
from me.
Only realest in the hood, you tell them hating niggas quit jocking me, ain't.
no need to copy me.
My nigga steph is just as real as me. Cold hearted young nigga patient with a.
bright future.
Nigga I'm that Eazy E.

Switching lane to lane, tryna find my way in.
Had to tell my nigga steph to put some crazy fire lyrics in.
Haters wanna knock em off but he tired, no really listenin.
Shinning with that chain up on my neck. that chain is crystal bright.
I'm forever working, gettin money was a job, I'm forever seeing light.
You haters in a jail cell, twenty five to life. I say ya'll ain't never seeing.
light.
I'm the one that's chilling, playing games I find a wifey when the time is.
right.
