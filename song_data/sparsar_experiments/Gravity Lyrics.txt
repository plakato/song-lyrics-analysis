Gravity Lyrics
by Xilent.

It's hard to keep my feet on the ground.
The way I'm feeling right now.
No gravity could be.
Ever containing me.
No, no, no-o-o.
I feel I'm falling skywards.
A force to be reckoned with.
And the emptiness i see.
Could it control me?
And nothing will be stopping me.
Not even the gravity.
Gravity.
Not even the gravity.
Not even the gravity.
It's hard to keep my feet on the ground.
The way I'm feeling right now.
No gravity could be.
Ever containing me.
No, no, no-o-o.
I feel I'm falling skywards.
A force to be reckoned with.
And the emptiness i see.
Could it control me?
And nothing will be stopping me.
Gravity.
Only one direction that I know.
It's up and im about to go.
Only one direction that i know and its up.
Only one direction that I know.
It's up and im about to go.
Only one direction that i know and its up.
Gravity.
Gravity-y-y-y.
Not even the gravity.
Not even the gravity.
It's hard to keep my feet on the ground.
The way I'm feeling right now.
No gravity could be.
Ever containing me.
No, no, no-o-o.
