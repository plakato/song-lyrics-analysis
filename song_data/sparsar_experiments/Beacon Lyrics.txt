Beacon Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

Wait for something more.

When you show I follow.

The beacon that is calling me.
The light that never dies.
Reflections thrown above the sea.
Casts shadows in the sky.

Standing right in front of you.
Is where I need to be.
Reliving this is something new.
And something finally.

Take the deep end.
And swim 'til you can stand.
Cause it will make a difference in the end.

Trip the shudder.
And keep the picture close.
Save it until you need it the most.

I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.
