Island of No Return Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.


Digging all day and digging all night.
To keep my foxhole out of sight.
Digging into dinner on a plate on my knees.
The smell of damp webbing in the morning breeze.
Fear in my stomach, fear in the sky.
I eat my dinner with a weary eye.
After all this it won't be the same.
Messing around on Salisbury Plain.

Pick up your feet, fall in, move out.
We're going to a party way down South.
Me and the Corporal out on a spree.
Damned from here to eternity.

Interlude.
I can only taste the ?
We're going to a party way down South.

I hate this flat land, there's no cover.
For sons and fathers and brothers and lovers.
I can take the killing, I can take the slaughter.
But I don't talk to Sun reporters.
I never thought that I would be.
Fighting fascists in the Southern Sea.
I saw one today and in his hand.
Was a weapon that was made in Birmingham.

Pick up your feet, fall in, move out.
We're going to a party way down South.
Me and the Corporal out on a spree.
Damned from here to eternity.

Interlude.

I wish Kipling and the Captain were here.
To record our pursuits for posterity.
Me and the Corporal out on a spree.
Damned from here to eternity.
