H.S.E. Lyrics
by Yung Redd.


You thought we was gone, but we ain't never left man.
There go them hustlers, 7-1-3.

Yung Redd.
I raise my head in the clouds, mo'fuckers I'm high.
Can't clip my wings, mo'fuckers I'm fly.
24 inch tires, on whatever I drive.
Nevermind get yours partna, I'ma get mine.
With no regards, y'all left me to starve.
Came back to clap niggas, like a round of applause.
Gave sight to the blind, when they was trying to see.
The last of a dying breed, what you trying to be.
From the home of Scarface, Bun and UGK.
Fat Pat, DJ Screw my tape was grey.
Ay no question, I'm the best kept secret.
Woke a couple niggas up, yet the rest kept sleeping.
Payback's a bitch, and this time we even.
How quick niggas forget, but I'm right back breathing.
Yeah, it's big bidness over here man.
This year's my year, y'all niggas scared man.

I'm not at all dreaming.
But in the back of my mind, I hear the crowd screaming.
That we back nigga.
I'm not at all dreaming.
But in the back of my mind, I hear the crowd screaming.
H.S.E.

Lil Ron.
Make room, for the next generation.
Headed to the ceremony, without an invitation.
Patiently waiting, you gracefully hating.
On the other hand, see it gives me motivation.
Check my past, the young cat that came up fast.
Cops flash them badge, I smash the gas and laugh.
They best bet, is to catch me on the rebound.
But that's impossible, with this new spot we just found.
I'm out they reach now, I can gather my thoughts.
In a couple of hours, meet me back at the house homie.
Because I can't, let 'em take me under.
And I ain't leaving, till the man call my number chump.

Yeah niggas, we fresh off hiatus mayn Sucka Free.
Yung Redd-Lil Ron, know I'm tal'n bout.
Humpty Hump, holla back.
