H.S.E. Lyrics
by Yung Redd.


You thought we was gone, but we ain't never left man 
There go them. Hustlers 7-1-3 
, 
Yung Redd 
I raise my head in the clouds mo'fuckers. I'M high 
Can't clip my wings mo'fuckers. I'M fly 
24 inch tires on whatever I drive. 
Nevermind get yours, partna I'ma, get mine 
With no. Regards y'all left me to starve 
Came back to clap niggas like a round of applause, 
Gave sight to the blind when they was trying to see 
The last of a dying breed. What you trying to be 
From, the home of Scarface Bun and UGK 
Fat Pat DJ Screw. My tape was grey 
Ay, no question, I'm the best kept secret 
Woke a couple niggas up yet the rest kept sleeping, 
Payback's, a bitch, and this time we even 
How quick niggas forget, but I'm right back, breathing 
Yeah, it's big bidness over here man, 
This year's my Year, y'all niggas scared man, 
 
I'm, not at all dreaming 
But. In the back of my mind, I hear the crowd screaming 
That we back nigga 
I'm, not at all dreaming 
But. In the back of my mind, I hear the crowd screaming: 
H.S.E 
 
Lil Ron, 
Make room for the next generation 
Headed to the ceremony. Without an invitation, 
Patiently waiting, you gracefully hating 
On the other hand, see it, gives me motivation. 
Check my past, the young cat that came up fast, 
Cops, flash them badge. I smash the gas and laugh 
They best bet is to catch me on the rebound 
But. That'S impossible with this new spot, we just found 
I'm out they reach. Now I can gather my thoughts 
In a couple of hours meet me back at the house. Homie 
Because, I can't let'em. Take me under 
And. I ain't, leaving till the man call my number chump 
 
Yeah niggas. We fresh off hiatus, mayn, Sucka, Free 
Yung, Redd-Lil Ron, know I'm tal'n bout, 
Humpty, Hump, holla, back
