Holy Cola Lyrics
by Two Crown King.

Shady eyes, weak knees, shift, shaky, and unsure.
It's funny how the one cut is anything but pure.
My league's dress code is snow, and so I've become stirred.
I'm leaving with one leaf left. Leaving it unturned.
And still I can't es-cape or avoid it.
Cause half the demographic that I run with enjoys it.
And half of that half-pack sacks for employment.
They used to work a week to make the paper they enjoyed it with.

I used to push it 'till the ??? the right spot.
We've got a couple different reasons 'till the heart stops.
And at that moment when you own it all ?? for free.
If there are limits to forgiveness or there's none. So wait and see.
See it's never been easy and I've known to be wrong, and by -.
\- ???
It still feeds on me daily. I ain't afraid to fess up.
But better yet I'd rather give it away then give in again.

Well I'd love - to love to let it go.
I'd love to – love to let it go.

Well I'd love - to love to let it go.
But this car won't stop or start to slow.
At this speed I believe we're going to break for sure.
God, gotta find a way for me to let it go.

I never asked for nothing. I never wanted squat.
You call it hustlin', cause you think hustlin's awful hot.
You call it making moves, and I call it standing still.
I keep a couple coins, and you keep ruber-banding bills.
And now it seems as if death is always two fold on the table;.
One for the people you pay the other for people who pay you.
It makes for awkward conversations more often than not.
Motorola ringing blowing up on the spot.
And yet you try to keep it secret like nobody knows.
Take your tissue with you. I ain't blowing nobodies nose.
Cause easy money's even easier money to blow.
You better bet the bigger the bump the better the bloody nose.

Well I'd love - to love to let it go.
But this car won't stop or start to slow.
At this speed I believe we're going to break for sure.
God, I gotta find a way for me to let it go.

Well I'd love - to love to let it go.
But this car won't stop or start to slow.
At this speed I believe we're going to break for sure.
God, I gotta find a way for me to let it go.
Holy cola. Keep on -.
\- rolling over. Keep on -.
\- hitting quotas. Freak on.
Powder soldiers get down.

Cause easy money's even easier money to blow.
You better bet the bigger the bump the better the bloody nose.
