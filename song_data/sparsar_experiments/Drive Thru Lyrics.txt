Drive Thru Lyrics
by Quilly.


Im stackin that money at PAL.
I beat my case at the trial.
Ima be here for a while.
She say that she lovin my style.
Trap house is open come Drive Thru.
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
Wow! Wow!

Whipping up the cakes.
Razor blade or plate.
I dont need no baggies.
Im just sellin weight.
I dont need no friends.
Long as my money straight.
I dont talk on the phone.
I just talk face to face.
Im countin these 100s and throwin these 1s.
I got paper on paper my money not done.
I got shooters on shooters so closet the gun.
Gotcha bitch at the telly she ready to cum.
Can't buy my jacket cuz its 1 on 1.
I just fucked dem bitches then its one and done.
I just hit a lick I did that for fun.
I just got a bag and it weigh a ton.

Im stackin that money at PAL.
I beat my case at the trial.
Ima be here for a while.
She say that she lovin my style.
Trap house is open come Drive Thru.
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
Wow! Wow!
Im servin them right out the drive thru.

Junkies at my door They just want some more.
Niggas at my door hit em wit the .4.
Hammers in the ceiling Ounces on the floor.
Gotta get this money sick of being poor.
Tired of these bitches.
Tired of fuck niggas.
Half ass trappas.
Tone wassup wit em.
I got 500 pills.
Brought a new wheel.
Got a new house.
Cousin Got killed.
Rest in Peace my nigga.
Pour a lil liquor.
They told me when you get rich.
You supposed to bring the family witcha.
TRAP TRAP TRAP.
Weed Dope Crack.
Good bye Bottom, Never goin Back.
I'on know niggas, Niggas know me.
I do my dirt by my lonely, No Codeine.

Im stackin that money at PAL.
I beat my case at the trial.
Ima be here for a while.
She say that she lovin my style.
Trap house is open come Drive Thru.
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
Wow! Wow!
Im servin them right out the drive thru.
