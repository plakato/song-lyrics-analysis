SLAM! Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

Right is yours, demonstrate.
Smoking to suffocate.
Carnival they got my body.
Nothing to compensate.

You ain't that kind of carnival, baby.
Carnival like never before.
You ain't the king over all the world, baby.
Cause the whole world ain't got no rule.

Slaaaaaam!
Slam! Comin' with me.
Slam! Comin' with me.
Slam! Comin' with me.
Slam! Comin' with me.
Slaaaaam!
Slam! Comin' with me.
Slam! Comin' with me.
Slam! Comin' with me.
Slam! Comin' with me.

Cryptical is my place.
Rebellions of a race.
Carnival they got my body.
I can run, they can chase.

You ain't that kind of carnival, baby.
Carnival like never before.
You ain't the king over all the world, baby.
Cause the whole world ain't got no rule.

Parisites crawl inside you.
Let them come take over you.
Feel them run inside of you.
I bet that day will break you.

You ain't that kind of carnival, baby.
Carnival like never before.
You ain't the king over all the world, baby.
Cuz the whole world ain't got no rule.
