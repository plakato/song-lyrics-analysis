Between My Legs Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

Oh my God!

You can go out dancin'.
And I'll write about you dancin' without you.
And I'll shed a tear between my legs.

When you were here I missed you.
Now that you're away I'm out there without you.
And I shed a tear between my legs.

Though we live in the same city.
You live in another state far away from me.
And all of my unfaded charms.

But when the rocket ships all fall.

And everybody's packin' up their station wagons.
There's a number you can call.
Like a breast that you can suckle.
And we quietly will exit as it all is happenin'.

Again I'm afraid of one thing.
Will I walk away from love knowing nothing.
Wearin' my heart between my legs.

But when I know you're naked.
Lyin' on the bed while I'm at the piano.
All I can say is I can't fake it.

When the rocket ships all fall.

And everybody's packin' up their station wagons.
There's a number you can call.
Like a breast that you can suckle.
And we quietly will exit as it all is happenin' again.

Cause there's a river runnin' underground.
Underneath the town towards the sea.
That only I know all about.
On which from this city we can flee.

There is a river running underground.
Underneath the town towards the sea.
That only I know all about.
On which from this city we can flee.

On which from this city we can flee.

We can flee.
