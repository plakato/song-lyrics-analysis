Tom & Jerry Lyrics
by NuLOVE.

You get rolled up like windows in the winter.
Who this dude with no crew acting foolish?
Cater to your table with this waitor flow, making cheese.
Pay the bills, haters still want to keep a gun concealed.
Smokey the bear would be really pissed cause we blazing trees.
I won't fuck your girl I'll just take her out to dinner nigga.
Who said Boycott ain't a winner?
Mike Wallace.
Left field, homerun, I just dont know who to feel.
Let me talk right quick. Yo.
Black and white nigga like blues music and cool whip.
They'll prolly be the same one scared to say the N-word.
Well heres 2 AK's in your face nigga, Columbine.
Who real as me? Hennessy, you the only ten I see.
Take your pic, print it on a shirt, nigga rest in peace.
'Til I make a hundred mill. Imma push the limits see.
Im the center of attention trying not to be a sinner so.
No benefits of living in this city where them niggas be.
4th street, writing rhymes, hope to see some dollar signs.
Y'all clueless. Hitting on ya broad like a Louisville.
Wrote this in a couple of minutes so let me do this.

Look at my wrist and see a blizzard.

For the fun of it we run it and keep it three hundred mill.
Smooveness, let me hit you with some smoove shit.
Yeah I'm acting out of line, balling like I'm out of time.
You don't have that problem..
Your sister and her fatherless baby gon' read eulogies.
I'm sippin on some sizzurp, girl tell me whats for dessert.

Tell me what you know about Pine Street, making beats.
I'm tryna be the one that niggas pay to see.
Dumping. But they ain't in relationships.
They go and fuck your sister then make an attempt to take to your bitch.
Chillin drinking pina colladas out in the Philippine's.

Oh, you thought new school ran 2K-12?
Let me say some shit right quick.
