Roof Deck Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


I beat that pussy up. Made it hurt and glisten.
Now I'm driving mami crazy like her purse is missin'.
Zin gets on a track, you know it's worth a listen.
I make nigga music; sh*t goes well with Church's Chicken.
I catch fire when the mic gets hot.
Time is money so I gotta write a lot.
Only thing I can't afford is writer's block.
Coz I'm all about my paper like I'm Michael Scott.
Them last, few bars were deeper than you thought.
F*ck it though, I just found an Iraqi whore.
Looking super-bad I'm ‘bout to tap it raw.
Zeta ‘bout to kill that ass like we're back at war.
But, if she's burnin' up, that ass is killin' Zeta....
And, in more ways than one, I'ma be in the paper.
And, that'll serve me right for dealing with them strangers.
But I know a good life costs death. Bill me later.

Listen:.
The fam here... the drink here....
The girl's here... and Zin's here.
Sex bash... roof deck... end up with somebody nice.
Get ass... loose neck... welcome to the party life.

Just look at all of them hoes, asking me for a taste.
Strippers, working them poles, got their asses all in my face.
While I'm grabbing one by the waist, scraping all of her insides.
I can tell that b*tch what she ate: baked chicken... french fries.
White girls, sisters, all sick of their misters.
Cool niggas, hot b*tches; we're about to play Twister.
Spoke to one for like six to eight seconds before I kissed her.
Told me she was from KY, so I proceeded to fist her.
Blessed her with that orgasm. Shoved the dick in her mouth.
She complained about jaw spasms; I kicked the b*tch out the house.
Moved on to the next one. Even called up my ex, son.
“I'm on 18th and Park South. Yo, just hop on that M1”.
Funny thing: I was really on 51st and Third.
And that's how you exact payback on a thirsty bird....
That f*cked you up in the past, and made you look like and ass.
“Now, good luck with that doorman you'll be trying to get passed.
Let's get back to the party, though. Had to hit up Graphic.
Nigga rolled through mad quick with two bad chicks, a new mattress....
And blue glasses on. Don't ask, kid. That nigga's OCD.
Only f*cks new twat on top of his Posturepedic Sealy.
Back to me: Got sleepy and took the only power-nap.
Woke up, and rose up next to Rosa to de-flower that.
Mami just got her doctorate, bent down on all fours.
I'm f*ckin' a PHD at the 4th penthouse on her floor. Get it?

Listen: The fam here... the drink here... the girl's here... and Zin's here..
Sex bash... roof deck... end up with somebody nice. Get ass... loose neck....
welcome to the party life.

Listen: The fam here... the drink here... the girl's here... and Zin's here..
Sex bash... roof deck... end up with somebody's wife. Get ass... loose neck....
welcome to the party life.
