ALL CAPS Remix Lyrics
by Unonimus.

Lyrics 
For, a second forget whether I am in the pocket or out 
Take your brain out of your pocket and listen to try to understand what I am
talking'bout 
All. I ask is that you walk around my chalk on the ground 
Admire from a far without trying to alter my clouds 
Cause, then it all gets rained over 
I reign over the kingdom ain't, no, stopping the takeover 
Like. We runnin' this rap-. Stop now understand I'm stunning. These rap
cliques 
And everybody's wanting a classic, but you ain't gon na, get that if you are
stuck in the past 
It's a prejudice against the game today you see, I hate to say it, but it seems we're scared, to
rate, better than Ilmatic 
I ain't trying to outdo Earl Or Capital Steez, I just happen to be 
Rappin', with ease as a passionate teen 
15 living with a stuck shift
key 
I swiftly spit 16s through trip beams 
To get in the rap game. That'S mission, impossible! 
Everyday! I face a different obstacle, 
Everybody's giving advice, and I can't listen to all of you 
Cause then, when I make it I'll feel like I should be mentioning all of you.
 
The person with the experience is never at the mercy of the person with the
argument 
 
Well. That all depends on perception 
Sanity as well. Now, let me lend a suggestion: 
The industry needs to stop bickering over legends, 
That already made it and take a look at the next generation 
So. While you argue over Pac vs. Big 
Remmeber, not every new emcee is an obnoxious kid 
And, I'm not trying to say I'm anything special 
Cause, I'm just like the rest.
