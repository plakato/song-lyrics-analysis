Ackrite Freestyle Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.


Lacing up the Nike's dude, I'm hoping that you're quick fam.
I'll assassinate your career faster than Dre did to Hittman.
The whole game's on my hit list.
If Kendrick's king then Vita's prince.
Fuck an iPhone homie, drop Verizon dog, you need to Sprint.
I stay by your home, creeping.
I'm known for throat-kneeing.
And choking non-believers till eyes rolling and dome's leaking.
Start screaming, eye me and you're medusa-freezing.
I'm cutting up your body and eating you while your heart's beating.
Yea.
This that horror movie shit for real.
Branches breaking, wolves are howling on a forest trail.
Killer instincts, I'm choking you with a phone cord, you're saying bye, bye,.
bye before you end sync.
I'm done playing fuckers, you had your time in the limelight.
I'm coming for you now, those five mics are mine right?
Hoping that my vocals can one day get my stacks right.
Until then I'm nobody, so fuck you if you ain't Ackrite.

Your nuts in my left hand, knife in my right.
Game in a stranglehold; it's pointless to fight.
I'm not famous yet so I don't need to act right, right, right, right, right.
You pussy ass bitches getting slapped on sight.
I'm getting drunk and fighting every god damned night.
Taking baths in holy water, can't see light, light, light, light.
