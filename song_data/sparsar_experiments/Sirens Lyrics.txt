Sirens Lyrics
by Unleash The Sky.

Everybody has got one.
War it's just begun.
Lies are words within honesty.
To keep controlled society.
No one wants to lose their ground.
Stay focused, calm down.
Listen to your inner self.
Cause truth will be the better help.

Your moment in the heart of the storm.
Hold the ones you love and don't ever lose your warmth.
The sirens singing sweet melodies.
The right path is not always the one that you'll see.

Try to live without regrets.
Give more than you get.
Free yourself right from the heart.
And never let it fall apart.
Can't you see it's up to you.
Why don't you break through.
Time has come to rise against.
It's our world in our hands.

Don't let go of your hopes, no, never again.
Don't you drift away from your dreams and everything.
