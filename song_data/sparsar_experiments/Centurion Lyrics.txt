Centurion Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


Our colors keep us all alive.
So when you ask for your supply.
I'll deny.

All our hate, all our rage.
Every feeling that we cage.
It only grows with age.
Where have we fallen?
Where I've gone, what I've known.
How I've lived and how I've grown.
It doesn't matter now.
Cause I know that I won't last much longer here.

You cast aside all the traits that make up you.
Just kill the truth, it's what you do.
So justified, humanity is cloaked from view.
What you exude is only what you want to.

I will confess, the element of ecstasy.
Is one I need, it's in my breed.
And all the rest, they fall into their places.
Just like they should, it's only natural you would.

I can't abide by the rules you've written through.
Each word is doomed, I will consume.
With honored fate, I step beyond your boundaries.
So where I am is only where I need to be.
