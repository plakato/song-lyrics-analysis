Zodiac Sky Lyrics
by Tyler Luke.


Spin that old vinyl, read the words in the bible.
The days get rough, look to the sky for an idol.
Blinded by the models, blinded by the stars.
Blinded by the lights, blinded by the cars.
The days get long, screaming for reassurance.
Still shouting, are you expecting an occurrence?
Sew your lips shut, tie your hands to a machine gun.
Bap bap, we killed another one.
Shut your eyes, listen as the world begins to fade away.
Keep your mouth shut, there's nothing left to say.
Keep your mouth shut, there's nothing left to say.

The rain pours, the days pass, the past disappears.
Years ahead await, the future is my darkest fear.
X2.

Look into the mirror, I don't know my self anymore.
Looking out the window, watching the rain pour.
There's a lost girl, sitting by the shore.
With visions in her mind of Prada and Michael Kors.
Glued to her iphone, never held a hand.
Never felt a hug, never willing to expand.
Entertained by satire and late night comedies.
Surrounded by tragedy and bashing remedies.
Crushing down crystalline, rolling alkaloid.
Got slipped some MDMA, thought it was an altoid.
Roofalin, never remember that night again.
She looks in the mirror her reflection resembles sin.
She sold her family bible for cash to buy morphine.
She's been an addict since 88, she was fourteen.
Not quitting now, not turning back to old ways.
The future's not there, neither is yesterday.
Fading through life, just a shadow in the night.
Never knowing wrong, never knowing right.
No one really cares, she remains out of sight.
No one really cares, she remains out of sight.
