Four Night Rider Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Cold wind whipping through the windows.
Freezing each of the lymph nodes.
Maybe we gotta try.
To get out of town tonight.

Well, I love you.
You know you love me and it shows.
Maybe we gotta try.
Let's crash at your place tonight.

Grandpa's passed out on the couch.
Take the greenbelt to your house.
There's a shortcut through the forest that smells.
There's a shortcut through the forest that smells.

As we hit the front door.
All the clothes hit the floor.
Maybe we gotta try.
To bike outta town tonight.

Well, I love you.
You know you love me and it shows.
Edmonton's just a four night bike ride outta town.

Cold wind whipping through the windows.
Freezing each of the lymph nodes.
Maybe we gotta try.

And I love you.
And you know you love me and it shows.
Edmonton's just a four night bike ride outta town.
