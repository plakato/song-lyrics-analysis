Clean Slate Lyrics
by The Swellers.

No more dreams of the southwest.
I just got a taste.
And a little dust from every state.
Caught underneath my shoes.
That'll never wash away.

I'm no stranger to the rust.
We made this with our hands.
From a billion other grains of sand.
I'd rather have gray skies.
Spotlights can burn through any man.

Call it a clean slate.
Not just a mistake.
For all this time, all this time.
It may be different.
But I don't feel so bad now.

There are no promises out there.
Maybe I can't see straight.
It eventually evaporates.
Got a slight change of plans.
I'll call some good friends of mine.
I'm never going back.
Or at least for some time.
And first a train off track.
I'll come back like an avalanche.

Call it a clean slate.
Not just a mistake.
For all this time, all this time.
It may be different.
But I don't feel so bad now.

I'll find myself.
I'll find myself.

Call it a clean slate.
Not just a mistake.
For all this time, all this time.
It may be different.
But I don't feel so bad now.

Call it a clean slate.
Not just a mistake.
For all this time, all this time.
It may be different.
But I don't feel so bad now.
