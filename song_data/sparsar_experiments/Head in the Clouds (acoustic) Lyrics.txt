Head in the Clouds (acoustic) Lyrics
by Union J.

Well call me crazy, call me lazy.
Maybe you can even call me ignorant.
Here's a tissue for the issue.
I don't care if it's on CNN.
I've got a lot to deal with.
I rather just be chillin'.
It's how I'm feeling.
Maybe I can worry about it all tomorrow.
I just want today.
Wo-oh, call me your fool.
Cause sometimes I just don't care.
I don't right now.
We all gotta do it, do it.
Cause life can be a b*tch then we die, we die.
There's so much sh*t to worry about.
And that's the reason why.
It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds.
All my days with my head up in the clouds.
All my days with my head up in the clouds.
Like wow, wow.
