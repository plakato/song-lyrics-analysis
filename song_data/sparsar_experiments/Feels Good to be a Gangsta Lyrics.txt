Feels Good to be a Gangsta Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Yeah, Slim Thugger.
Yung Ro, Color Changin' Click.
Boss Hogg Outlawz, Paid In Full.
Boyz-N-Blue, damn it feels good to be a gangsta yeah.

Slim Thug.
Damn it feel good, to be a gangsta.
A young ghetto superstar, on the block.
All the kids in the hood, look up to the Boss.
Cause they see me, with the ice and the drops.
I'm the one niggas call, when shit jump off.
Cause they know I'm never scared, to blast.
And if you talk down, on my side or my hood.
I'm quick to put a hole, in your ass.
O.G. Slim Thugger's, what they call me.
All the young G's, give me they respect.
Cause I made it out the hood, and a nigga living good.
But I still, look out for my set.
All the chicks, wanna be in my presence.
Just to witness all the riches, and the power.
They never seen a young teen, grow up to be a king.
Getting what they make in a year, in a hour.
All the while, I don't let the cash impress me.
Cause I've been a young hustler, from the start.
It's just all my hard work, slowly paying off.
Cause God knows, I'm a hustler in the heart.
See I never let the money, or fame change me.
You can still catch Slim, in the streets.
And even though I rap now, still keep a strap now.
Tucked up, under the seat.
So all I gotta say, to you wanna-be gonna-be.
Dick sucking, motherfucking prankstas.
When the shit goes down, what the fuck you gon do.
Damn it feels good, to be a gangsta.

Yeah, we take pride in what we do.
And personally I'd like to describe myself, as a nobody though.
You feel me, I don't give a fuck what you do my nigga.
Whatever you do take pride in it you feel me, feel good.

Yung Ro.
Damn it feel good, to be a nobody.
Well respected, you can call me Yung Ro.
You see my name ring bells, from movies to doing flows.
But I still, got so far to go.
So I keep on grinding, with my head up.
And realize, I done came a long way.
But my mind's on the future, and my future's unpredictable.
I can't stay crunk, about today.
So behind all the fame, and the lime light.
I'm bout bidness, everyday of the week.
Cause I got people depending on me, and they can't understand.
How I can come home, without food to eat.
But when I'm grinding, and I'm tired of it all.
Telling God I'm sick and tired, of this place.
It ain't a feeling in this world, that can compare to the look.
Of appreciation, on my mama's face.
So I hold it down, for my T. Lady.
My kin folk, and my niggas on the block.
Right boogie when I can, and send 'em words of inspiration.
Cause I know, it get hard on lock.
So when I come to your city, doing shows mayn.
Show love, when you see me fall through.
Just holla nobody, and I swear I'll holla back.
Cause that's how, real nobody's do.
Now throw your set in the air, if you gang bang.
Affiliated, or just love the hood.
Could give a fuck where you from, if you real it's one hundred.
That's my word homie, it's all good.
So when you hear me on a song, screaming nobody.
You gotta know what it mean, to be a nobody.
To say nobody, huh g'yeah.
Damn it feel good, to be a nobody.
