Creation Lyrics
by Two-9.


Tried to tell em' 
All we can do is show niggas now 
 
Look, uh 
Said. I smoke good, but I drink better 
With, my primo and that blunt lit in my
Bape sweater 
Ridin' round in that nice weather, 
My, bad bitch, a young savage 
All, my niggas, authentic wit', it 
These other niggas, so average 
My rap fully strong 
Pockets, don't fold, but I'mma Need mo', 
Got checks from promoters got hate from these niggas 
But love from these hoes 
Real life, nigga doin', real life, shit 
No time for basic bitches need a real life. Chick 
Uh educatin', my niggas on how to get rich 
How to make it don't waste it. You got ta make it flip 
How the fuck, this nigga talkin'. He ain't made a cent 
And. You tell by the gang that I'm with the shit 
Bankrolls on bankrolls I'm gettin' rich 
Dutchrolls on dutchrolls, I'm gettin' lit 
Niggas talkin' real crazy, like I need a strap 
Promise that I'd never touch it, don't know how to act. 
Probably be the first to catch a fuckin' case. 
I know this fuck nigga lyin'. Look me in the face 
All. These niggas in my section, give me fuckin' space 
And the blunt still hittin', like its fuckin' laced 
Moneys'. All I want it's all. I fuckin' chase 
And. If you don't know well, you goin' know today 
Uh Two-9 till that fuckin' grave 
It's. All I ever said all I got ta say: 
Gettin' love from Queens all the way to the Bay 
But. I'M from the South shit. I rep the A 
Made a lot of dough, but I need mo' 
Smoked a lot of dro, but I need mo' 
Got enough friends. I don't need mo' 
Phone full of hoes, but I need mo' 
Got enough problems. I don't need mo' 
Gettin' 5 for a show, but I need mo' 
This nigga. We need mo' 
This nigga, we need mo', 
 
 should go for what you know. 
No need to get comfortable 
Understand. I need some mo' 
Man. It'S all a nigga know. 
 should go for what you know. 
No need to get comfortable 
Understand. I need some mo' 
Said. It'S all a nigga know. 
 
 
Nigga see that I'm the cure in a test tube 
With in doubt, in your best suit 
Make sure your next move be your best move. 
Clear the room leave fumes in the booth, nigga 
Toxic waste. The doctors can see if I'm a rider 
 
We mobbin', we mobbin' understand we mobbin', we mobbin'
