Creation Lyrics
by Two-9.


Tried to tell em'.
All we can do is show niggas now.

Look, uh.
Said I smoke good, but I drink better.
With my primo and that blunt lit in my.
Bape sweater.
Ridin' round in that nice weather.
My bad bitch a young savage.
All my niggas authentic wit' it.
These other niggas so average.
My rap fully strong.
Pockets don't fold, but I'mma need mo'.
Got checks from promoters, got hate from these niggas.
But love from these hoes.
Real life nigga doin' real life shit.
No time for basic bitches, need a real life chick.
Uh, educatin' my niggas on how to get rich.
How to make it, don't waste it, you gotta make it flip.
How the fuck this nigga talkin', he ain't made a cent.
And you tell by the gang that I'm with the shit.
Bankrolls on bankrolls, I'm gettin' rich.
Dutchrolls on dutchrolls, I'm gettin' lit.
Niggas talkin' real crazy like I need a strap.
Promise that I'd never touch it, don't know how to act.
Probably be the first to catch a fuckin' case.
I know this fuck nigga lyin', look me in the face.
All these niggas in my section, give me fuckin' space.
And the blunt still hittin' like its fuckin' laced.
Moneys' all I want, it's all I fuckin' chase.
And if you don't know, well you goin' know today.
Uh, Two-9 till that fuckin' grave.
It's all I ever said, all I gotta say.
Gettin' love from Queens all the way to the Bay.
But I'm from the South, shit I rep the A.
Made a lot of dough, but I need mo'.
Smoked a lot of dro, but I need mo'.
Got enough friends, I don't need mo'.
Phone full of hoes, but I need mo'.
Got enough problems, I don't need mo'.
Gettin' 5 for a show, but I need mo'.
This nigga ? we need mo'.
This nigga ? we need mo'.

? should go for what you know.
No need to get comfortable.
Understand, I need some mo'.
Man, it's all a nigga know.
? should go for what you know.
No need to get comfortable.
Understand, I need some mo'.
Said, it's all a nigga know.

?
Nigga see that I'm the cure in a test tube.
With in doubt ? in your best suit.
Make sure your next move be your best move.
Clear the room, leave fumes in the booth, nigga.
Toxic waste, the doctors can see if ?, I'm a rider.
?
We mobbin', we mobbin', understand, we mobbin', we mobbin'.

?
Control it, control it.
Control.
Control it.
Never let it take control.
Control it, control it.
Never let it take control.
Control it, control it.
Never let it take con- ah.
Control it, control it.
Never let it take control.
Control it, control it.
Never let it take control.
Control it, control it.
Never let it take control.
Control it, control it.
Never let it take control.
Control.
Control.
Control.
Control.
Ha.
