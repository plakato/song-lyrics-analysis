Glock Luv Lyrics
by Black Kray.

I be coolin, my blood buz he be boolin.
I'm on my chirp phone, I'm posted like a young hoe.

I got a goth hoe and she straight out of Maxis.
Glock love x20.

I'm a young nigga, I don't fuck with sixes.
Repping crip gang, blunts fat like Gucci.
Glock love.
And on the flip phone so young nigga ain't textin.
I'm with my cousins and you know they got them Glocks out.
Triple 7, posted up in heaven.

Bust your Glock.
She want a thug to ride on 26s.
Velour blunts, cause a young nigga be stressin.

I'm in the south with KayKay, yeah he posted.
Gold slugs in my mouth looking like hoes.
