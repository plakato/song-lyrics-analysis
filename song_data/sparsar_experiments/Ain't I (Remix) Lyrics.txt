Ain't I (Remix) Lyrics
by Yung La.


You got to know the boy futuristic, ain't it?
My work can make the J's do the jumpman , can't it?
You got to know this the remix right here.
Grand Hustle baby, it's the kings.
right here.
You got to know we gwoppin,.
pockets extra sloppy.
Don't I love my vegetables extra cheese and broccoli.
Don't Yung la like to kick it like karate.
Don't I be with J-Money serving everybody.
Ain't we up in Magic City throwing up the profit.
Ain't me and Tip taking off like a rocket.
Ain't my ain't my ain't my ain't my ain't my money long.
Ain't I ain't I ain't ain't I still putting on.

Ain't I.
Ain't I smoking strong, ain't I putting on, ain't I rocking yays, ain't my.
money long.
Ain't I.
Ain't I' in the'ville, ain't I on.
the hill, ain't I on the pill, ain't I keep it real.

Ok my rims so big I'm at the tip top ain't I.
Choppers in the trunk will make you do the maccerena.
Polo to the floor, yea mother.
fucker ain't I.
All black coupe, I can buy it bitch can't I.
Remix, Yung La and T.I, this a banga.
Dro be on that thang, you don't hear me trick ain't I.
Big Rolls Royces, and I got them nauseous.
We be in Ferrari's, the cars with the horses.
Ain't I on the pill, riding down Dill.
Iced 30 below minus the wind chill.
Ain't I packing chrome, ain't I going strong.
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I got it going on.
Young Drooooooooo.

Ralph Lauren purple label.
Ain't I fresh as I can be.
Made it through my situation, ain't I blessed as I can be.
Ain't I laughing at you haters trying to take a shot at me.
They don't know which way to go, I'll make it easy, follow me.
Honestly ain't I insane, that's the way it's gotta be.
Ain't I so so superfly, boy ain't nobody hot as me.
Ain't T.I. all on tv when he wake up and go to sleep.
Everywhere the notice me, and for yourself just go and see.
My community I'm serving though they hope I don't succeed.
Hear me speaking, so intrigued,  no indeed.
You come with that common flow,.
your show I have to commandeer.
Since I see you can't take over, I'll just have to volunteer.
Ain't I your superior, listen here bra you not a peer.
I'm so Zone 1 that it ain't funny,.
twice the G that I appear.
Rep Bankhead so loud and clear.
Gon be gone for bout a year.
So Paper Trail you gotta hear.
But ain't that Ain't I outta here ayy.
