Cursed Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


I'm cursed with loving you, baby.
It hurts cause you'll never know it.
I was put here to hopelessly love you.
And you ain't thinking of me.
That's the torture I go through.

It's been a long long time now.
And I'm still trying to get you.
Out of my head, of my heart.
Of my whole damn soul.

This love is still lingering.
It's getting old.
But it ain't dying.
It's not even trying.
And I can't fight it.

I just bury it at the bottom.
Hoping you might find.
You are my love where my first.
And now this love is just a curse.
Oh, Yeah.

I don't know why I even called.
Thinking our time has come again.
Cause the first time wasn't right.

No, we were too young.
I was too serious.
You wanted to have fun.
And now I look at us.
And see How good it could be.

If we could only get past the past.
And see that the love we had is there.
If we try it could last.

I'll be always loving you.
I'll be always loving you.
No matter what or where.
I'll always care.
