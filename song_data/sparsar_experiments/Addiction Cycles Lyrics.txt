Addiction Cycles Lyrics
by Quelle Chris.


...Not using for an entire year, really ? on me, and we're gonna be looking.
at , uhm, what that's about, what we call an addiction cycle and breaking the.
cycle... What then?

I got many shades, I'm Calico cat.
I'm over this party, I rather go rap.
These bitches is dumb, miss, these niggas is wack.
I cook a new drug, it's better than that.
I had a disease, I couldn't connect.
They call it MC, go ahead and inject, like that.
You feel better now? Ease into it.
Your mama and your papa told you: please don't do it, right?

It's better than sex, you melting away.
Tomorrow was today, and today was....
The sound of the rain.
The blare of the horn.
The bust of the beat.
The stroke of the snare.
The grip of the hand.
The taste of a sound.
The sight of a smell, inhale.
You are officially down....

Same shit that make you grow.
Be the shit that break your bones, though.
Between success and death I live but a stones throw.

It's incomplete, It'd be some feat to walk this road dolo.
Still here through two Cuomos.
Folks getting old, Moms can't drive the Volvo.
Hard grills is marble, cry diamond tears, bleed rubies.
Bruised feet got tar heels.
Don't confuse what you call my art.
With just how my heart spills.
We're Khalil Gibrans, prophets of this modern day spiel.
Truth food for thought's a holiday meal.
That keeps you from being a corpse that the corridor seals.
Up in that bag, few words like a cut or a stab.
A movement on Earth for merely running it back.
Records spin in revolutions.
The milk and honey, recovered in wax.
The weining moon, breakin' through the clouds.
To make another route from they Nino Browns.
Separate the ways how.
They was putting you down....

I got many shades, I'm Calico cat.
I'm over this party, I rather go rap.
These bitches is dumb, miss, these niggas is wack.
I cook a new drug, it's better than that.
I had a disease, I couldn't connect.
They call it MC, go ahead and inject, like that.
Feel better now? Ease into it.
Your mama and your papa told you: please don't do it, right?

It's better than sex, you melting way.
Tomorrow was today, and today was....
The sound of the rain.
The blare of the horn.
The bust of the beat.
The stroke of the snare.
The grip of the hand.
The taste of a sound.
The sight of a smell, inhale.
You are officially down....

Oh, I know what you're describing what happened to you said it's uh, you've.
been possessed,  you said you were possesed ?, I don't particularly.
know what I was possessed by, but uhm,... You described that the possession.
being the addiction, that my addiction actually isn't ? a life of its own,.
and it's not the devil, you know it's not all this other stuff you have around.
possessions, but it's that my addiction has this voice and its a very powerful.
voice that has its own personality and gives me directions, and so, no matter.
what I say, at some point during the day, this possession or this personality.
or this addiction, suddenly becomes stronger, and it takes over the part that.
says I'm not gonna use anymore, and most of us find that we are willing to.
quit our addiction, but we don't know how not to use anymore, and that's it,.
thank you, see you later....
