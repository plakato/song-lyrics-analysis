Big Momma's Theme Lyrics
by Vita.

Jermaine.
Yo New York in da house.

Brooklyn in da house.
Uptown in da house.
Chi Town in da house.
Atlanta, Georgia are you in da house?
West Coast in da house.
Vita.
Everybody in da house.
Baby, baby come on.
Baby come on.

Vita.
Yo, yo, yo who that be?
V-I-T-A.
Big Momma lady murders away.
We play twenty-four hours a day.
Mind on money twenty-four hours a day.
It's hard to say or tell.
When there's love in the air.
So I continue to be Miss Dawg of the year.
And take care of my peeps when the streets is hot.
You need a place to stay just pull out the cot.
And I swerve in the two-door car without no shotgun.
Driver took 'em lukewarm to hot like lava.
I not one that's forgotten.
There's a lot of haters that be hatin' for nothing.
With their hand out waitin' for something.
Chick like me I waits for nothin'.
Put in work till the cake come in.
So breathe easy whenever you need me.
Just yell, V-I-T-A know it well.

1 - Destiny's Child.
This is Big Momma's house.
We ain't gon take no poppin' off at the mouth.
This is Big Momma's house.
Those that get a chance to dance.
They get turned out.
This is Big Momma's house.
One night spent here.
Have you climbing up the wall.
This is Big Momma's house.
We ain't gonna take no mess at all.

Da Brat.
You know how Da Brat-tat get.
The dough stack what?
Ready for combat get your head cracked.
What?
Could cook a steak up and dice that paper.
Chop it up like onions to add that flavor.
I'm fresh even your mami wish I was her seed.
I rip a hole in the track as it bleed.
I breeve on 'em and make 'em feel the heat.
Obviously it's evident I can't be beat, what?
I strut in dem thirty-eight jeans or the fitted ones.
Either way you still wanna split something.
Could it be the curves in the waist?
Or could it be the Suburban I push when I swerve through the place.
Got the nerve to not be able to be replaced.
Haters can't tap in cause I can't be traced.
This my house, don't speak until spoken to.
Disrespect me and I'm choking you what?

Jermaine.
No uh come on.

Put your hands up.
Put your hands up.
Put your hands up.

Destiny's Child.
No, no!
