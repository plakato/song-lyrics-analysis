Simmons Incorporated Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

Dig Dast  {Gold D}.
Yo my nigga Jamel Simmons what the deal nigga?

{Aight, what's goin on, what's goin on.
What's the deal pa, where you headed son?}.

{Word?} Ain't he a Reverend now, collectin plates.
At churches and shit?

Uh-huh.

Jamel Simmons.
I'm red rum, Reverend Run, brother son, earthquakin.
Industry shakin, you kiddin me? We money makin.
Your money fake son, I'll call you clay cause you get's Play-Doh.
Jamel and Joey Simmons holdin millions on the lay low.
Platinum hailos, hero heads high from hydro.
Hit the dime on the combo, she try to diss my rhyme flow.
She ain't know we only glamorous like Phat Farm fashion.
Simmons name sinamous wit this cash.
It's our passion... What!?

Run.
Yo basically I'm here to rename rap, it ain't rap no more.
Call it Simmons Incorporated, since '74.
Lotta money in this fam, think about it.
Me wit Run-D. M. C., and him over at Def Jam.
Well damn, how the hell you think we livin?
How you think it feel to be a Simmons.
Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving.
People wanna know why I ain't on my brother's label.
If I did this whole rap game be unstable.
Went over to Arista wit Mr. Davis, for the change of neighbors.
It's only fair that we share those naked papers.
You can tell a cat serious about rap and it ain't luck.
If 20 years after his first single, his name's stuck.
From '74 to '99, did novice to king, wit a million.
Mc's waitin in line.
Keep a barrel on this album if my man's and them rise.

Method Man.
Now speed it up, uh.

Run really make ya wanna drop, drop.
Now wanna make ya go live, live.
Now wanna make ya go live, live.
Now hold up.

Method Man.
Now I walked on ice and never fell.
I spent my time in a plush hotel.
John-John Phenomenon, deadly but calm.
Word to my born, dead by dawn.
Got the right to bear arm, ring the alarm!
Another sound boy dyin, hot irons.
Slugs flyin out the hardware appliance.
Baby mamma cryin, sobbin and grievin.
You was at aws wit them kids till they made it even.
Let down ya guard, yes you did, now you barely breathin.
To unaware, open season on a duck, we don't give a what.
Yo best best to give it up.
Sho indeed, let's Run D's mc's, they phony.
Some hump free, they mad bogey.
Saddle up ya horse, if the sunset mosey.
Jam Master Jay deserve a trophy for this track, right?
Futuristic G past type, if that's yo girlfriend.
She wasn't last night punk, little boy.
Stylin mad chump, ain't no wins here.
This sport's extreme, know what I mean?
Gettin royalty, +Down With the King+!!!

D. M. C..
Crack, crack, cracks in the cradle.
Cracks, in the cradle.
Cracks in the cradle, cokes in the spoon.
Little Boy Blue higher than the moon.
Will he, will he want a weapons, will he wanted the wound.
I come to school and lay down the rules.
Two, two, two channel empty guzzle, brake gallons of drop.
Shorty wit the forty, once sport in the dark.
Co-co-corner, black as a goner.
Didn't really wanna call my momma in Savannah.

Mike Ransom.
I spit dynamite ignite turn off lights.
Recite, spit poetry type, get my squad physically hype.
Get a hundred blast from Funkmaster, crush ya life.
+Blast+ Time to go now, show these fake rappers the way to go down.
Down With The Kings, like Smokey down wit Motown.
Who wanna come and see, come and test me.
Take about a million mc's to wet me.
For Run-D. M. C. I let shells fly, freein the five.
Wit the red eye, niggas talkin to much.
Tape 'em up, leave 'em hog tied.

Kenny Cash.
You thinkin about it way to hard, how to get down wit the Gods.
Kenny Cash, the Bronx cat, but it'll ride wit gats.
Peep chicks huggin the sacks, yours scratchin the back.
I'mma shark in a shack, y'all cats is feedin the fish.
Now hate and feed wit clips, nigga that leave you ripped.
And I'm leavin 'em dry, shit's crushed wit bleadin lips.
Bet I, leave these chips, and a C. L. K.
After I hang plaques in the spot wit Run, D and Jay.
