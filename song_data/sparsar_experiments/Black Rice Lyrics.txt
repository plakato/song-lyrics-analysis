Black Rice Lyrics
by Women.

On a bleak Monday morning.
Holding my head.
Everything tastes right.
Permanent daylight.
Neatly stained fences and gates.
Lions to tame.
Cut through the front yard.
You were a stranger.
Scenery you've cut and glued.
The scent of tropical ash underneath your shoes.
Black rice suddenly spills and drifts apart.
A swelling ocean swallows me but all i really want's just another breath.
Black rice, lady we knew right from the start.
Right from the start.
And your plants become a chore.
Stripes on the pane.
Lashes so vibrant.
Left on the table.
With your chalk and trembling chair.
You look like a painting.
Out on the sidewalk.
Noone was watching.
Fighting up this flight of stairs.
Your anonymous lovers braid a dazzling chain.
Black rice suddenly spills and drifts apart.
Bricks are rising in the blue.
You dread the sight of this place.
Its too dry its true.
Black rice, lady we knew right from the start.
Right from the start.
