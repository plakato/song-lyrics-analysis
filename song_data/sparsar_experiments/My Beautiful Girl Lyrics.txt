My Beautiful Girl Lyrics
by XO.

I've been waiting for you baby.
Like a scene from your favorite movie.
And I'll hold you oh so tightly.
When you sink beneath the soil.
I'll be your roots.
You'll be my breath of air.
You be my breath of air.
I wanna wash your pain away.
And bring you a dozen roses everyday.
Cause it's hard for me to believe.
That you have found the one you need in me.
I've searched the world for you.
My beautiful girl.
The world for you.
It was all that I could do.
It was all that I could do.
I am waiting for the day.
That you and I can find a special place.
And lay beneath the trees.
And all the birds will sing in perfect harmony.
I've searched the world for you.
My beautiful girl.
The world for you.
It was all that I could do.
The world for you.
My beautiful girl.
The world for you.
It was all that I could do.
It was all that I could do.
Just smile for me and I'll be fine.
I won't let this go.
Our love will never die.
