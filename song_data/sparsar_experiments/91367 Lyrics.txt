91367 Lyrics
by Volumes.

I just hit 'em up.
I'm losing my mind.
The pressure is building.
I gambled my life.
A couple thousand on the dice.
Scared money don't make no money.
Watch what you say you can't take it back.
I'm going in.
Now watch me double that.
Have you heard I can't go like that.

Push it from the back let's just watch it all burn.
Light it up tonight we'll be taking our turn.
Push it down and pull it back.
Cause we love the night and we own the blur.

Take the nerve back.
Again I'm high.
Crawling inside.
Feeling alive.
Losing track of time.
Caught in the cycle.
The never ending cycle.
When you're coming at me you better come correct.

The way she moves it back n' forth.

In front of me.
Damn'man.
No we don't kid and play.

Let me tell you I don't love that bitch.
I said it, don't forget it, I meant it.
I ain't playin' around no more.
I don't love that bitch.
I said it, don't forget it, I meant it.
I ain't playin' around no more.

We came through the back.
We roll it up.
Of the party, about to light it all up.
Another round, give me your best shot.
Get up let's party.
About to pour it all down.

Remember that I never forced it on you.
Put this gun to your head and pull the trigger now.
I wanna warn you that you may see red.
Just let me live.
Please don't bring me down.

Come correct when you're coming to me.
I tell myself, yeah you got this.
One more pill and she popped it.
There's no going home.
No sleep.
Until the sun rises.
Take the nerve back.
