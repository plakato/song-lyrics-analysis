Fuckin Wit A Gangster Lyrics
by Ruste Juxx.


You know what crime is it, 211.
Juxx 7:30 with a 357.
4:20 I'd be puffin that magic.
Smoking some disaster, inhaling that tragic.
Ya'll know who's the best MC that's no brainer.
Godzilla son blow smoke you no flamer.
I've been a barbarian, haggard-ed viking.
Run up on the stage stab Ya'll for the mic 'an.
Commence the slaughtering, sharper than a meat cleaver.
Raised in hell, ???? like a street sweeper.
???? hit you with the double barrel.
I put about twenty more holes through your apparel.
Call me the finisher, not Mr.C.
But I rep Brooklyn hard till I D.I.E.
So why try me.
I'm so deadly.
J.U. double X R.U.S.T.E.

Interlude: Ruste Juxx.
Ya nigga, check my motherfucking record. Nobody fuckin with me. Platinum..
Underground.

You fuckin wit a gangster.
Gangster niggas born to kill.
Any rat niggas signing them papers sworn to squeal.
You fuckin wit a mobster.
Mobster niggas live the life.
Screaming fuck you pay me twice.
I'm that nice.
You fuckin wit a gangster.
Gangster niggas born to kill.
Any rat niggas signing them papers sworn to squeal.
You fuckin wit a mobster.
Mobster niggas live the life.
Screaming fuck you pay me twice.
I'm that nice.

Yo I'm from Brooklyn, killah Crown Heights to be exact.
Homicide, drugs and gangs is where it's at.
White cops wanna pull me over cause I'm black.
I ain't stoppin cause I'm strapped.
With a pocket full of crack.
Hideout what, fuck the gingerbread man.
Come lookin for me you'd be a certified dead man.
Black out like Redman fuckin with Meth.
You should've been weaving a right, ducking a left.
I shine brighter.
Than your top five lime-lighters.
You snitchin.
Whole bunch of drop down crime fighters.
Bitches ain't shit, niggas is worth less.
So what you do. Execute-em what was your first guess.
I'm very un-rational.
A lot of suckers like to use the word dramatical.
To make em sound radical.
But why try me.
I'm so deadly.
J.U double X R.U.S.T.E.

Fuck you and your FUBU sweater.
Your cheap ass jeans and your Zulu leather.
You shoot true never, I'm the son of Jor-El.
Turn my toothbrush to a shank and have fun in the jail.
Everything I spit is real and I mean it.
Jigga payin Dwayne, I'm payin Gilbert Arenas.
I don't buy work, I take it from dudes who heard wrong.
Survival of the fittest, handle my business and get gone.
You the shit Sean, call me El-Dookie.
Pitch rock the fiend, your tight jeans Lupe.
I stay to myself cause I don't like convo.
I stay gettin fresh, I don't dress like Marco.
Polo, in Levi's strictly.
Nike's on my feet I stay O50.
So fly nigga, I don't know why.
Good Muslim brother, big beard no bow tie.

Ya just for record this Sean P, Younahmean. I write all of Ruste's.
shit,Younahmean. If you a Ruste Juxx fan I know your a Sean Price fan.
, Younahmean. I'm the.
ghost-writer. P. And Marco kinda fly wright now, I wanna change the line, but.
