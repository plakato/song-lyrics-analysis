Both Sides of the Story Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Much more important, than the pain we suffer.
Is our response to the pain, I'ma let y'all hear.
Both sides of the story, who's side are you on.

Say where I'm from the days are cold, nights are colder.
The streets on fire, keep me talking to the two sitting on my shoulder.
, so I turned back.
And seconds before I hit 360,.
But the last voice spoke calm, so I here I stand gat in my palm.
But the other began to speak louder,.
And to be honest I chose the aggressive voice, it was easy.
Followed any road he choose no matter the risk, wherever he lead me.
, so I was paranoid so scared to go to sleep.
, riding through the city mad at the world invented.
my creep.
Seen a familiar face at the club one night, just trying to have a drink.
Then he bumped me and a voice yelled , before I could even think.
And then I fell to the floor, shot in the chest.
Together we layed on the floor, felt funny when our eyes connect.
I saw the pain in his eyes, so I searched for that other voice fast.
Embarrassed to ask for mercy or help, and heard the other voice laugh.

How do I ease the pain, when I know the devil coming back.
You know, they say war's inevitable, which is why it is essential.
That we study it, and equip thy selves with the right tools to fight.
So grant me the serenity, to accept the names I cannot change.
Courage to change the thangs that I can, the wisdom to know the difference.

How can I, ease the pain.
When I know you coming after me.
How can I, ease the pain oooh.

Yung Ro.
Dear Father, I'm having problems controlling myself.
Rather talk to you nobody understands, so I roll by myself.
On this road by myself, but never neglecting those two footprints.
Cause when I was lost and fell behind, look where Jesus went.
Right in the front and I love him for that, and not to mention.
We been chopping some game up, he helping me trying to get it back.
You know love that is, cause I admit I'm running low.
Trying to ease this pain on my own way, ha that I know.
Foolish of me right,.
But ain't I responsible for my actions, and which road I take.

I know but I'm ashamed for being weak, and letting the devil always win.
, man I ain't gave up.
Got a few scars and suffered some pain, but ay I'm a soldier I play it tough.
man I'm up,.
What about my depression and in securities,.
And I believe that and I need that in my life, just like that Juve song.
But I weave back cause they feed that negativity, yeah they do me wrong.
, yeah you right let me stop complaining.
, man Lord it get hard but I'm just saying.
I'm a man , so I praise you.
And try my best to make you proud, what I owe you is more than I gave you.
But I'm trying to get paid too, in this crooked bidness that's full of snakes.
Don't know what the future hold so lately your boy, ain't been feeling great.
Now what can I do to stop this pain, I took a look at the sky.
Asked for forgiveness and felt the ease, just as soon as I apologized.

Pain, suffering ha, or is it just discipline from God.
Many try to find out the difference, who is the author of suffering.
