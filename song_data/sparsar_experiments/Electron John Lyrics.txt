Electron John Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

Electron John.
Where are you?
Electron John.
I hope we can dance today.
Electron John.
I can hear you from a mile away.
Your fluffin' bass surrounds you.

Electron John.
Where are you?
Electron John.
I hope we can dance today.
Electron John.
I can hear you from a mile away.
Your fluffin' bass surrounds you.

Electron John.
Where are you?
Electron John.
Where are you?
Electron John.
I hope we can dance today.
Electron John.
I hope we can dance today.

Electron John.
I hope we can dance today.
