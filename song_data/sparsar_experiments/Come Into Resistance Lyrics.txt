Come Into Resistance Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

I lay awake every night, thinking about what to do.
I already know we will surely come to a row.
Agressions send out with might.
We will darken the light.
Gotta meet a new friend, I need to speak.
I'm talking to you, because I'm so cofused, I am insane.
Somewhere I heard, we will soon come to war. What to do?
So, join our secret circle.
Now, come into resistance!
Please don't judge me.
For I'm too scared.
But who'll take care of my dears?
So untrue brave new world seems to me, mankind's cruel.
Soon we'll reciprocate kill each and all.
Need to do anything, there must be a way out of disaster.
World still turns 'round but how far can we go? - I don't know.
So, join our secret circle.
Now, come into resistance!
Please don't judge me.
For I'm too scared.
But who'll take care of my love?
I see a coming hell - earth will release the dead.
I feel the pain of all you - who are condermned to death.
I feel the lineliness - of those who are left home.
God is already gone from us.
Back into nothingness.
Please don't judge me for I'm too scared.
I cannot leave my dears alone.
Please don't judge me for I'm too scared.
I'm not alone - alone.
