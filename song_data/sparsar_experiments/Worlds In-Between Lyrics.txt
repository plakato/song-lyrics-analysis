Worlds In-Between Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

Spoken 
Try to play God
It's part of the game
Some choices are not yours to make

Sang 
The skeletons in my closet
And the ghosts of my past
Are, aligning against me
And approaching fast

Drowning in black seas
Of infinity
Encircled by monsters
Lurking, just beneath

The scuttering in the shadows
And. The chill up my spine
Are, a disturbing warning
Of, my borrowed time

Secrets and ciphers
Have me by the throat
I - do not think that I can
Remain afloat

I have seen things
That you have only dreamed
But. Maybe they are nightmares
Of worlds. In-Between

Here there be monsters
And beasts, unknown
And they're, never ever ever
 Gon na leave me alone

I have seen things
That you have only dreamed
But, maybe they are nightmares
Of worlds. In-Between

Here there be monsters
And beasts, unknown
And they're, never ever ever
 Gon na leave me alone

I. Don'T think that I can stop it
If. I could I don't know how
I, don't think that I can stop. It
It is much too late. Now

I have seen things
That, you have only dreamed
But, maybe they are nightmares
Of worlds. In-Between

Here there be monsters
And beasts, unknown
And they're, never ever ever
 Gon na leave me alone

The gibbering of these creatures
With. Their shrieks and their cries
In, their death and their blood
I will be baptized

That is not dead
Which can eternal lie
And with strange aeons
Death may die

The clamoring in the darkness
And, the stench in the air
Now. What unholy outcome
Have I engineered

Victorian fictions
Are thrown to the wind
Now. I must take up arms
And fight for my sins

I have seen things
That you have only dreamed
But, maybe they are nightmares
Of worlds. In-Between

Here there be monsters
And beasts, unknown
And they're, never ever ever
 Gon na leave me alone

I have seen things
That, you have only dreamed
But, maybe they are nightmares
Of worlds. In-Between

Here. There be monsters
And beasts, unknown
And they're, never ever ever
 Gon na leave me alone

I. Don'T think that I can stop it
If. I could I don't know how
I, don't think that I can stop. It
It is much too late. Now

Worlds in-between
Worlds, in-between

Worlds, in-between
Worlds in-between

I wish these were nightmares
But. They are far too real

And. I wish these were figments
Of a sickness not yet revealed

Worlds in-between
Worlds in-between

I have seen things
That, you have only dreamed
But, maybe they are nightmares
Of worlds. In-Between

Here there be monsters
And beasts, unknown
And they're, never ever ever
 Gon na leave me alone

I. Don'T think that I can stop it
If, I could I don't know how
I. Don'T think that I can stop. It
It is much too late. Now

I have seen things
That, you have only dreamed
But, maybe they are nightmares
Of worlds. In-Between

Here there be monsters
And beasts, unknown
And they're, never ever ever
 Gon na leave me alone.
