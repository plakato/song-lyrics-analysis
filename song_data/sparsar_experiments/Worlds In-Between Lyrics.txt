Worlds In-Between Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

Spoken:.
Try to play God.
It's part of the game.
Some choices are not yours to make.

Sang:.
The skeletons in my closet.
And the ghosts of my past.
Are aligning against me.
And approaching fast.

Drowning in black seas.
Of infinity.
Encircled by monsters.
Lurking just beneath.

The scuttering in the shadows.
And the chill up my spine.
Are a disturbing warning.
Of my borrowed time.

Secrets and ciphers.
Have me by the throat.
I do not think that I can.
Remain afloat.

I have seen things.
That you have only dreamed.
But maybe they are nightmares.
Of worlds in-between.

Here there be monsters.
And beasts unknown.
And they're never, ever, ever.
Gonna leave me alone.

I have seen things.
That you have only dreamed.
But maybe they are nightmares.
Of worlds in-between.

Here there be monsters.
And beasts unknown.
And they're never, ever, ever.
Gonna leave me alone.

I don't think that I can stop it.
If I could I don't know how.
I don't think that I can stop it.
It is much too late now.

I have seen things.
That you have only dreamed.
But maybe they are nightmares.
Of worlds in-between.

Here there be monsters.
And beasts unknown.
And they're never, ever, ever.
Gonna leave me alone.

The gibbering of these creatures.
With their shrieks and their cries.
In their death and their blood.
I will be baptized.

That is not dead.
Which can eternal lie.
And with strange aeons.
Death may die.

The clamoring in the darkness.
And the stench in the air.
Now what unholy outcome.
Have I engineered.

Victorian fictions.
Are thrown to the wind.
Now I must take up arms.
And fight for my sins.

I have seen things.
That you have only dreamed.
But maybe they are nightmares.
Of worlds in-between.

Here there be monsters.
And beasts unknown.
And they're never, ever, ever.
Gonna leave me alone.

I have seen things.
That you have only dreamed.
But maybe they are nightmares.
Of worlds in-between.

Here there be monsters.
And beasts unknown.
And they're never, ever, ever.
Gonna leave me alone.

I don't think that I can stop it.
If I could I don't know how.
I don't think that I can stop it.
It is much too late now.

Worlds in-between.
Worlds in-between.

Worlds in-between.
Worlds in-between.

I wish these were nightmares.
But they are far too real.

And I wish these were figments.
Of a sickness not yet revealed.

Worlds in-between.
Worlds in-between.

I have seen things.
That you have only dreamed.
But maybe they are nightmares.
Of worlds in-between.

Here there be monsters.
And beasts unknown.
And they're never, ever, ever.
Gonna leave me alone.

I don't think that I can stop it.
If I could I don't know how.
I don't think that I can stop it.
It is much too late now.

I have seen things.
That you have only dreamed.
But maybe they are nightmares.
Of worlds in-between.

Here there be monsters.
And beasts unknown.
And they're never, ever, ever.
Gonna leave me alone.
