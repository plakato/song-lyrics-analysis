Drag Em 'N' Tha River Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..

Yella.
You fake cheerleadin' bitch! You want a nigga like me to beware, ha?
I'mma show you some spokes right now, you bitch you.

Tec-9.
Take them braids out his head Yella.

I'mma drag him from tha river dump his body in Chuck's yard.
Leavin' a note around his neck readin' BAD ASS YELLA BOY.
Oooooh he wants some? Ain't that cold?
YOU A HOE MYSTIKAL.
YOU A HOE MYSTIKAL.
See I'm from the 3 and I.
don't give a fuck.
And I know you thought I wouldn't be back but you can't keep me down.
Don't forget about the U and the Cash Money Clowns.

I'm from the 3 and I don't give a fuck, for the record.
Once again it's Mystikal with the Chuck's.
I'm back up on the scene with the 2 like a Viper.
Get in so much war I think I straighter than a sniper.
Mystikal you bitch, are you ready for the drama?
Told your ho ass people ho don't run I'll kill Mama.
If I catch ya wit your draws down I'mma do ya.
Once upon a time I up the roof and gimme the cruiser.

I be the jack of all trades don't make me splizit, your fuckin' head.
The queen I mean the King , I mean he learned many trades.
Comin' to get'cha round the pen, ready to unwrap your braids.
Gay blade, now what'cha wanna do? My nuts you can chew.
Because they told me you wanted to battle.
Told em you better scaddattle.
You ain't bout no B-1 Doctor show, don't make me bust you up.
Braids that'll fly up from the roundhouse socks, that roll-o.
Let go of my shirt you ho, blood's up on my polo.

Stop playin' with me, stop playin' with me bitch, stop playin' with me.
I'm like the B.G.'z I'm gat totin'.
By this time it's the bulldog barrel smokin'.
I hope they catch and chop ya down, tear ya ass apart.
Thrash all the swine touch down your brains on the ground.
I gots the gat spell it backwards.
That's what I do up on that ass ya bitch I'm not an actor.
I'm comin' dumpin' on ya fake punk wannabe.
I warned ya too many times to watch the bloody tragedy.
I got the diamonds to the bauds, twinkle up your golds.
Now spin the bin, in the turtleneck polo cuz I don't care.
Fuck what you sayin' about beware.
I'm tired of tellin' you that I'm a donkey nigga.
Stop playin'.

I'm in the front room, in the whirlaround, the brown table.
Are you able? Capable? All of a sudden, um....
I had to pop em, I had to pop em.
I top em all and respect is what I need.
Hollow tips in the clips just to make your ass bleed.
I'mma drop this pussy with the braids off see.
I'mma dump his body in Chuck's yard, UNLV.
I told this Mr. Cheerleader not to fuck with me.
I told ya to keep my fuckin' name out ya fuckin' mouth.
You didn't do it now it's time to take your ass out.

I gets lowdown and dirty with the dirty 30.
Because I'm in your neighborhood plus my nose dirty.
I'm into Chuck's house, deliverin' the bad luck.
As I spin the bin with speed, it's too late to duck.
I'm like Jim Harbaugh, puffin' on a hot Marlboro.
I'm strictly with that asshole and comin' to down ya far.
Why did I ask would I please leave ya alone ya see?
I caught my enemies slippin' gettin' groceries.
I waits behind the mailbox like an old drunkard.
As Archie Bunker, comfortable? You bitch you.
You see I walk by, I ride by, I drive by too.
I got's to hang a 45 and a AP-9 too.
