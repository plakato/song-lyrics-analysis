Stay In Luv Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

When I fell in love.
I wrote a song every week.
Then I stayed in love.
And it was like I fell asleep.
The silence was so perfect.
I didn't want to speak.

Then I woke up.
And your absence.
Begged for sound.
And i tried to find a way.
To fill the emptiness I'd found.
But at first.
I could only whisper.
But then the murmur.
Got louder.

I can't seem to stay in love.
I can't seem to stay in love.
I can't seem to stay in love.
I guess my heart.
Just beats too fast.
Or whatever.
