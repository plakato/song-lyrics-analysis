Gold Alpinas Lyrics
by QB.


Yea huhh
Niggas wan na flaunt they pistols
I go north korean on em started flaunting missels
My, mind reload, like ah 9, so it ain't bout money. Then it ain't bout. My time
You see these niggas behind me. They ready to ride. They kill you just too see
your fucking mama cry
Heartless. The same niggas gone off them suicidal thoughts like they ready to
die
Fuck it. A nigga lost his train of thought. These niggas playing mind games, but
ain't got the heart
To me. It feels like a art
And. I pray, it never gets old. Til death. Do us part
She say she want me to be her leading man
So much pussy up on my mind, cause it all can't fit in my hands and ah nigga
rather pay uncle sam before I ever feed, ah open hand

Listen to my words

Looking at my fucking family dieing
Sitting in the Funeral watching my mama cry: hmmph shit is getting fucking
hective, so I smoke everyday just to keep from stressing
Tryna think. Besides these fucking bitches, all they want is material, thangs, a
fucking mistress
Thats, why? You can't trust them all hmmph its only one that I can call
She know who she is. She knows that she, my down bitch when im down she's the
only one thats around bitch
So, I dont love them hoes and I dont trust them either soon, as I fuck em I duck
em, then I leave sleeping
I dont play not fucking games and I got dont conversate with Pussy'S are no
fucking, lames
You, can't trust these fucking niggas cause. All they wan na do is get ya. Money
Get ya. Riches
They use you to get to the top thats all they need, and once they get in to
the leagues, they use you all. They can hmmph
And as soon as you fucking broke. I bet them. Niggas ain't around bro, fuck, em, 
,
