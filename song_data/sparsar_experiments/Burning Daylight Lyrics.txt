Burning Daylight Lyrics
by The Union.

Lurking in the shadows of your mind.
Creeping paranoia, black clouds all align.
Give me a sign, before we run out of time.
We're burning daylight.
Sitting on the fence thinking everything's gonna be alright.
I'm feeling so tired.
Time is ticking on and on.
And we're burning daylight.
Sand falls in slow motion through your hourglass.
While the world around you is moving twice as fast.
Don't you hesitate.
The hour is getting late.
We're burning daylight.
Sitting on the fence thinking everything's gonna be alright.
I'm feeling so tired.
Time is ticking on and on.
And we're burning daylight.
I watch you gazing at the sky.
Life is passing you by.
Lurking in the shadows of your mind.
Creeping paranoia, black clouds all align.
Give me a sign, before we run out of time.
Don't make me run out of time.
We're burning daylight.
Sitting on the fence thinking everything's gonna be alright.
I'm feeling so tired.
Time is ticking on and on.
And we're burning daylight.
We're burning daylight.
