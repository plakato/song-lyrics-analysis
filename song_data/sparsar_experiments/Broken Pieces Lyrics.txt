Broken Pieces Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


I woke up in the place we started.
Your clothes on the floor in that old apartment.
I never thought you'd leave without a trace.
I can't shake this sinking feeling.
I know you're not there and I'm barely breathing.
Holding onto things I can't replace.

I'm looking for a way to change my mind.
Don't walk away.

Oh, tell me what we're fighting for.
It's turning to an all out war.
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces.
And let go.
I'm tryna find a way back home.
If it takes until I'm skin and bones.
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces.
And let go.

Luke &amp; _Michael_.
Our last words ringing in my head.
I wish we'd take back all the things we said.
I'm tryna find a way to yesterday.
_Turning in circles and chasing our tails_.
And wondering why we created this wasteland.
_I wish you wouldn't be so cavalier_.

I'm looking for a way to change my mind.
Don't walk away.

Oh, tell me what we're fighting for.
It's turning to an all out war.
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces.
And let go.
I'm tryna find a way back home.
If it takes us to the hidden walls.
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces.
And let go.
Let go, let go.
Fix these broken pieces and let go.

We're fading out, we're all alone.
It's what you wanted, I suppose.
I can tell you feel the same.
When you say you're looking for a way to change my mind, don't walk away.
_Oh, tell me what we're fighting for.
It's turning to an all out war_.
We'll find a way to fix these broken pieces.

Oh, tell me what we're fighting for.
It's turning to an all out war.
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces.
And let go.
I'm tryna find a way back home.
If it takes us until I'm skin and bones.
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces.
And let go.
Let go, let go.
Fix these broken pieces and let go.
