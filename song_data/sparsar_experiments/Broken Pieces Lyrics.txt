Broken Pieces Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


I woke up in the place we started: 
Your clothes on the floor in that old apartment, 
I, never thought you'd leave without a trace. 
I can't shake this sinking feeling 
I know you're, not there and I'm barely breathing 
Holding onto things. I can't replace 
 
I'm. Looking for a way to change my mind, 
Don't walk away, 
 
Oh, tell me what we're fighting for 
It's. Turning to an all out war 
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces. 
And let go 
I'm tryna find a way back home 
If. It takes until I'm skin and bones 
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces. 
And. Let go 
, 
, Luke,
