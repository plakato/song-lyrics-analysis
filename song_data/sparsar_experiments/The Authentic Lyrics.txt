The Authentic Lyrics
by Ruthless Bastards.

Infrared.
Uh-huh, Ruthless.

Eh yo, my fam's desperate.
When it get real, we let the tech spit.
We like AIDS for those who think they can't catch this.
We manifested this rap shit, we could go beyond this rap shit.
Let the gat spit, buck that hatchet.
You fake rap was malpractice, let me get at this.
And show you where the fuck you lack is.
These Bastards is like Cassius Clay with the gun play.
It's like drivin your car down a one-way.
You bound to get hit, my style is legit'.
Nigga, wildin ain't shit, cuz I can do that and do this.
But I analyze, niggas chit chat, I plan to rise.
Yo, my fam is live, livin this life, we still fantasize.
About the better life and all that real cheddar.
Cuz we forever trife, that shit'll make me feel better.
I be Infrared, niggas keep y'all guns in y'all holsters.
I'm out for the bread, so I make lead jump out the toaster.
I keep my people closer, closer than you'll ever get.
Niggas is delicate, bomb like a gun, you never spit.

We the authentic, far from counterfeit.
Bound to hit, me and my Shaolin click.
Son they talk shit, but they forever forfeit.
Bangin with the Blaquesmiths, kid, we want fish.

Sha Gotti.
Eh yo, we blow hydro, hit hoes and tag toes.
Fo'-fo's put holes in Parasucos.
I used to hustle on the block, holdin crack in my asshole.
Now I do shows, sip the Crist', forget the Moe's.
Watch my back, for Colombo's and Donnie Brasco's.
Droppin tops on convertibles, lyrically murder you.
Who are you? I never heard of you, verbally servin you.
I analyze 'em then I size 'em up, where's the rope? Tie 'em up.
Gag his mouth, shut him up, Ruthless Bastards don't give a fuck.
I run up in your mansion, hold your family for ransom.
When I'm twisted off Branson, too thugged out for dancin.
You'll niggas askin for Sha to jump in a stolen Maxima.
I drive by clappin ya, pay attention when I'm after ya.

Hip-hop is writin and rhymin, a way of life.
To hold the mic in your hand and crush everything.
in front of you, that's hip-hop..

Truck.
Caught in collisions, niggas cut you 'cisions with razors.
Little league niggas bleed from fuckin with the majors.
This wild life's contagious, in guns we trust.
And if they're aimin at my team then ain't no more to discuss.
I charge to bust, goons from my platoon to bang.

Orangutangs swingin through this concrete jungle.
Slangin them thangs, bummy with grimy niggas in the struggle.
Either we love you or hate you, half the shit y'all can't relate to.
Like niggas actin like you feel just to snake you.
Scientific breakthrough, your flow's infested with cyanide.
When I die screamin Fuck the world!, I lease 'em high.
Beast from SI, fuck with my peeps from I, increase the crime.
When I release the nine, tryin to teach the blind to shine.

Inspectah Deck.
Yo, yo, yo, ill greed general, war platoon steez.
On the battlefield stripes get stripped off your sleeves.
They bleed like we bleed, I fiend for the cheese.
Just like you, in order to feed my seeds.
No remorse, so I'm forced to bring forth the flames.
No game, engrave out my name into your brain.
The nobel, Sir I, rap mogul.
Move global on you locals, blow em when I've come through.
Hundred deep, nuff heat stashed in the Jeep.
On the creap, like broken floodin the streets.
Yo, this is for my niggas who post on live corners.
The brawlers who keep they hands on the nine Taurus.
Straight out the woods, hit the hoods like a taskforce.
Mass force, pullin the sting, take the cash off.

Son they talk shit but they forever forfeit.
Bangin with the Blaquesmiths kid we want fish.
