Up in your mix Lyrics
by Two Inch Punch.

I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
You are the best to ever make me feel this way, baby.
You are the best to ever make me feel this way, baby.
I missed you, I missed you, I missed you.
I missed you, I missed you, I missed you.

I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!

Where are you.
Baby baby, where will you sleep, where will you sleep, where will you sleep.
Til morning, oh baby.
Baby baby, where will you sleep? Where will you sleep? Where will you sleep?

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.
I miss where you are.

I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
I'm up in your mix, in your mix, in your mix!
