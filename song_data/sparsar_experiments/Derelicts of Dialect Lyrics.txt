Derelicts of Dialect Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

The great will always soar, above, the mediocre.
They create, while others destroy.

Pete Nice.
Never had a wasted mind, had the time.
Erectin rhyme I cause gifted lines.
The flows I knows puts the papers in pockets.
Swings of things, observed in my sockets.
In ten spot I got stacks of LP wax.
Couderoy slacks, loops and sales tax.
On the racks but my label is Derelict.
Spic-n-Span I slam, it's balls you lick.
Ill missions, but doin us ain't even simple.
Stereotype the rhymer as a criminal.
Subliminal I put a noose on the necks.
The sinister signs of my rhymes is sex.

...

MC Serch.
Smooth, set-up so slick.
As I set to move, all the great masses.
Asses bounce to track that is all in.
I'm droppin my quarter, I'm placin my call in.
To my crew that's down with the street trends.
Play around and you'll fall off the deep end.

But I got a girl, so I called up three friends.
And they called three friends.
And so on, and so on, and so on...
So go on my path, and try to follow.
But not step for step, cause I like to sidestep.
You'll get swept like a broom and you'll make room for daddy.
White boy in New York and I can't get a cab G.
So take me to my rest so I guess I'll get wrecked.
Cause I'm a derelict of dialect.

...

Pete Nice.
Dialect spoken, in sectional lesson.
The less you know, the more you gotta guess on.
I press on point, some sweat my jizznoint.
Playin themselves with the fingers the point.
I speak slow, I carry a fat stick.
Get your kneepads and reapply your chapstick.
Step to this, as the Derelict reanimates.
No jim hat as my mouth ejaculates.
I stays mumble, I speaks jumble.
Phonetics on phonograph'll prime your petrol.
Retroactive, my knot scale is tipped off.
I rip the head off, the Derelict stepped off.
And left to show this, to those who typecast.
Ill the rhyme-ass trickster or outcast.
Of intellect, I wreck shit with my own sect.
The ace in the hole, I'm the Derelict of Dialect.

...

MC Serch.
3rd Bass, but not a bass for slidin.
Foundation, for a nation who's mind is.
In motion, goin in fluid.
Who did you just distrust? It's Serch and I crush this.
Mental need for oppression.
Oppressed and all vexed and just placed a suggestion.
Lesson or loss enforce those in.
A spot who got your head frozen.
Defrost the eye and spy on the serpent.
On act two, he tried to close curtain.
But intermission I glimpsed and I clock more.
Derelicts watch act three and the encore.

...

Individuals who are never satisfied with the static standards.
Set by the masses -- the masses have always been lethargic.
They have always opposed greatness for it is beyond them.
To even.. comprehend greatness.
