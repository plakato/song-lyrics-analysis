No Gravity (Beyonc√© Demo) Lyrics
by Unknown Artist.


Oh, Oh.
Oh, Oh.

I'd rather be dead or crazy, crazy.
Than to live without my baby, baby.

Everybody wants to be a star.
But we got something bigger , we got something bigger than that.
Look up, up to the stars.

Riding in a spaceship.
Doing it no gravity.
Riding in a spaceship.
Love the way you're grabbing me.
Riding in a spaceship.
Doing it no gravity, gravity.
Love, love, love the way you're grabbing me.

I don't need no air.
Love the way you're grabbing me.
When you're, when you're pulling out my hair.
I don't need no air.
Baby we can make love in your spaceship.
I wanna make love in your spaceship.
Let's do it with no gravity.

Even when I'm feeling lazy, lazy.
I still put in work 9-to-5 over time just for my baby.
Just for my baby, baby.

Everybody wants to be a star.
But we got something bigger , we got something bigger than that.
Look up, up to the stars.

Riding in a spaceship.
Doing it no gravity.
Riding in a spaceship.
Love the way you're grabbing me.
Riding in a spaceship.
Doing it no gravity, gravity.
Love, love, love the way you're grabbing me.

I don't need no air.
Love the way you're grabbing me.
When you're, when you're pulling out my hair.
I don't need no air.
Baby, we can make love in your spaceship.
I wanna make love in your spaceship.
Let's do it with no gravity.

If I blow a kiss it floats straight to you.
All of my loving just gravitates to you.

- No there can't be a limit when.
Edge of the world is where we begin, begin.

So let's do it with no gravity.
Do it, do it with no gravity.

I don't need no air.
Love the way you're grabbing me.
When you're, when you're pulling out my hair.
I don't need no air.
Baby we can make love in your spaceship.
I wanna make love in your spaceship.
Let's do it with no gravity.

Let's do it with no gravity.
Let's do it with no gravity.
Let's do it with no gravity.
Let's do it with no.
gravity.
