Don't Tell Mama Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


I was headed north on highway five, one star lit Sunday night.
When a pickup truck flew by me out of control.
As I watched in my headlights, he swerved left and then back right.
He never hit the brakes as he left the road.
I found him lying in the grass among the steel and glass.
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side.
Through the blood and tears, he whispered in my ear.
A few last words just before he died.

Don't tell mama I was drinking.
Lord knows her soul would never rest.
I can't leave this world with mama thinking.
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath.

I still think about that night, how that young man died.
How others sometimes pay for our mistakes.
Last thing on his mind as he left this world behind.
Was knowing someone else's heart would break.
