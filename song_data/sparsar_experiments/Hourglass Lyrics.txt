Hourglass Lyrics
by Viza.

Last night I dreamt of holy lands with unholy laws.
Last night I met an acrobat without any arms.
The shortest straw will win her hand in marriage.

Tonight I long for fairy tales and heavy hearts.
Tonight I turn over every stone that you wore out.
The shortest straw will win her hand in marriage.

I'll find you, then hide you, in my hourglass.
I'll find you, then hide you, in my hourglass.

Fickled seasons. Seasoned demons.
Rumi's reasons got me thinking now.
