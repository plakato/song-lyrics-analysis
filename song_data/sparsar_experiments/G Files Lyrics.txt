G Files Lyrics
by Viva Fidel.

Viva fidel:.
Grapple with me.....
Active affirmations.
Trafficking back &amp; forth.
In between news flashes.
And indecent propositions.
I'm in a heaven of a position.
Trying not to get sweated by a pig.
A swine.
A blood sucker.
Lollipop, hitch hiking, side speaking imitatiors.
Need not even speak on these.
Serious vibrations.
Made from the original seed.
Groove and Krush.
Rock, Bounce, Break.
Stop all the hate!
We see through the politricks.
And the distractions.
Its time for a new satisfaction...ultimately.
And right on time.
We stash this right in the G Files.
As the secrets stalk the streets.
Keep ya lil dividends to yourself.
Take ya last breath and get this right.
We have arrived.
We are here to help.
This is Healthy Hip Hop.
I am viva fidel.
Signing out, right here.
Yea!
