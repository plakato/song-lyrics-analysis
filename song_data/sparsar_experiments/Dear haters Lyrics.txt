Dear haters Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


Who the fuck is this.
Who the fuck is this nigga here.
Who the fuck is you.
Who the fuck is you, bitch.

These niggas mad as fuck and it's obvious.
Hollow Squad the fleet, you can not stop us bruh.
You can get your ass beat real quick.
We ain't the ones to play with.
All my niggas high ass fuck, gettin' buck.
We don't give no fuck, nigga.
This bitch told me I hurt her feelings.
Cause I don't want to fuck with her.
Bitch I'm still smokin', guarrante that.
Who got another sack.
Damn, Backwood packs, I be on that.
Smokin', smokin', smokin'.
Back to, Back to, Back to back.

Who the fuck is this.
Who the fuck is this nigga here.
Who the fuck is you.
Who the fuck is you, bitch.
