Gold teeth, Sun dress; Goons and Ballerinas.
We look like we some killas, and they look like Ballerinas.
She dancein' with the devil, she move like Ballerinas.
Let her sip from out my cup; Goons and Ballerinas.
She relevay, I pass a jay; Goons and Ballerinas.
My crew, her crew; Goons and Ballerinas.
They was kinda nervous, but I know what to do though.
Make the Sprite pink, then I tell 'em that it's Nuvo.

She a bad Dominicana, but she cold as Ben &amp; Jerry's, I take her to.
Benihana.
She told she a goddess, so this devil get behind her.
She so fashion forward, I think the devil is behind her.
'specially if he wear Prada, she Margiela and Y-3.
She kick it in Supreme, when she kickin' it wit' me.
Red bandana be her halo, and she move like ballerinas.
We roll another one, as another hour went by, I heard her compliment my.

God you're sexy.

Just going through your day aimlessly with no real purpose, then, you really--.
You can have goals but, meetin' those goals and expectations, is not too.
realistic.
Me personally; I'm here.
