No Scope Zone Lyrics
by Yung 69.


Young cis.
Just kidding I'm not cis.
Oh yeah, and by the way this is a diss.
To @scopey cuz he is such a bitch.
You think your life is potato, well I'll mash ya.
Thats why they call me the hash slinging slasher.
Ayo scope what I have for you is a surprise.
But how can i trust that you won't plagiarize.
What happened to M'balls.
Now your raps just make me say pause.
Smh ur not even in london.
We all know you are bluffin.
Scope coulda been something.
Now he literally nothing.
Cuz his career is over.
I'm taking off in the Land Rover.

No scope zone.
No scope zone.
He know better.
He know better.

Scopey hey you smell like baloney.
Run over you like tony.
Youre just a second string gay mynamescody.
U think we are friends but u dont even know me!!!

No scope zone.
No scope zone.
He know better.
He know better.

Wait wait hold up stop the song.
Let me talk my shit.
Fuck scopey we dont play that shit fuck nigga off yourself faggot.
Back the fuck off lil nigga or get blown the fuck out.
My yung nigga yung 69 came threw with the diss track.
This is war and ur not ready for war.
Shoutout to my crew we run this shit.
0ld 420 i see you nigga.
Giada de laurentiis wut up girl.
Chillin.
We out.
