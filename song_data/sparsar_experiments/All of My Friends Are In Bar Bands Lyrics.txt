All of My Friends Are In Bar Bands Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

Jack says he loves the winter here.
Cause these are days when everyone's as miserable as him.
Josh says it smells like cheap beer and loathing here.
It could be the van, but it's probably just his breath.

Max dropped out of college.
But he likes to say he finished.
He's working back home with his dad.
He and Kevin got matching tattoo's of their initials.
And three X's down their legs.

Well I've got like-minded dudes in Detroit or Vancouver.
Newport, Boca and Brum.
I don't know where I am.
But I know where I came from.

So everyone moved in with their girlfriends.
In one-bedroom apartments.
In the town that we grew up in and.
All my friends are in bar bands.
I don't know how it happened.
I hope it pays the rent.
And still there's some days.
When I don't think that we'll ever see Dave again.

Justin's working three jobs just to stay ahead.
Spiro lied about his major.
But it's working out for him.
Nick and Richie got a place together by the train station.

I've spent twenty-two years just wading through bullshit and hey.
It's worked so far.
I don't know why I'm here.
But I know who my friends are.

So everyone moved in with their girlfriends.
In one-bedroom apartments.
In the town that we grew up in and.
All my friends are in bar bands.
I don't know how it happened.
I hope it pays the rent.
And still there's some days.
When I don't think that we'll ever see Dave again.

Matty Arsenautt of A Loss For Words.
I'm not sad anymore.
I'm just tired of this place.
And if this year would just end.
I think we'd all be okay.

Dave Mackinder of Fireworks:.
I'm not sad anymore.
I'm just tired of this place.
And if this year would just end.
I think we'd all be okay.

We moved on again, We're not wasting away.

Shane Henderson of Valencia:.
I'm not sad anymore.
I'm just tired of this place.
And if this year would just end.
I think we'd all be okay.

We moved on again, We're not wasting away.

Jamie Rhoden of Title Fight:.
I'm not sad anymore.
I'm just tired of this place.
And if this year would just end.
I think we'd all be okay.

We moved on again, We're not wasting away.

Nik Bruzzese of Man Overboard:.
I'm not sad anymore.
I'm just tired of this place.
And if this year would just end.
I think we'd all be okay.

I'm not sad anymore.
I'm just tired of this place.
And if this year would just end.
I think we'd all be okay.
