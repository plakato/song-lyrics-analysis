Her Dearest Lyrics
by Twitch.


And they say.
The only place you can touch a woman to maker her go crazy.
Is her heart....

Such a shame man.
Girl had a game plan.
Lose her V to her dearest.
Spend her life with the same man.
But you know males.
We ain't changed since the caveman.
And four years on this nigga playing them games man.
She never did him wrong.
Forever by his side.
She knew the chick too.
How she gon' let that slide?
That was her one and only.
Wept like her mother died.
But she can't help but be angry this mother fucker lied.

Mascara streaming down her cheek.
Friends keep ringing but she don't even wanna speak.
'Cos she done a deed she'd been thinking 'bout for the week.
Now her bedroom's feeling smaller and the smell's starting to reek.

Looked in the mirror.
Palms sweaty.
Arms shaking.

And she ain't got the heart to do it 'cos her heart's breaking.
Saw the proposition of love, it was for the taking.

Now she caught up in the biggest heartbreak in the making.

Now she outta town.
Cruising with some gear.
Speaking to her conscience.
It told her listen here.
You really think that you can make it all just disappear?
There's heartbreak everyday.
You think you different dear?

But she ain't tryna heed.
She just upping the speed.
Nearing her destination.
Like the journey's decreed.

Now she pulling up to the spot.
2 black bags man I think you can guess what.

Carried one on her back.
Dragging one on the floor.
Where exactly she going?
I don't think that she's sure.
She just wanted revenge.
Really thought it would cure.
But the pain in her stride ain't ever been this sore.

Put down her bags then she picked up her phone.
Text her lover: All I ever wanted was you on my own.

And as the world turn.
She let that mother fucker burn.

And as the world turn.
She let that motherfucker burn.

She never did him wrong.
Forever by his side.

Such a shame man girl had a game plan.
Lose her V to her dearest.
Spend her life with the same man....
