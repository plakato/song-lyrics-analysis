Day After Day Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Feel As Good As I Look ‘B.
Need A Couple More Mirrors.
I Feel Like I Look Better Than My Baddest Bitch.
You Know What I'm Saying, I Don't Give A Fuck ‘B.

Uh.

Yea.

Day After Day, Lord As My Witness.
We Disrespectin Hoes Fuckin Nigga Bitches.
Day After Day, Word to My Niggas.
Ain't Worried Bought A Drought, I Handle My Buisness.
Day After Day.
Whats Up Nigga.
Day After Day.
The Fuck Nigga.

Ghost Had a Glock.
Tre Had a K.
Makin Movies in the Daytime, Matinee.
Whikey Done Put Me Up On Game To What Them Crackers Say.
Okay, You Fuckin Bitches, Anne {And} Hathaway.
Wishin For A Gram, Its Itchin on My Hand.
STOP.
I'm Fly like the zipper on my pants.
I don't need no cable, I got bitches on demand.
And I'm shittin on you niggas like I'm sittin on the can.

YERT, Bye.

Call me Bodega, Shawty.

MOE, Money Over Errything.
Blowin on that Mary Jane.
Cold like a Dairy Queen.
All your niggas is some bitches Tyler Perry scenes.
Keep a Halle Berry team we be servin erry fiend.

WOO.

No in-betweens by any means I intervene.
Residue I keep in my jeans.
Can't explain the way I lean.
Hasta Lavista, Se Lavie.
Night After Night, Everyday I Sleep.
Bitch Nigga hatin bout how I move.
How I live and the way I eat, c'mon.

The bars is sick, and if you was to call ya chick.
She won't pick up cause she on my dick.
Its like a fucking newborn the way I spawned the wrist.
We Outta Weed, Call Rick.
To bring more of the piff.
Yeah, skinny broads, no, I need a chubbie bitch.
These niggas hate but these hoes love me quick.
Plus my money thick.
And I'm known to kill the Mic on some Conrad Murray shit, L's.

Rick Flair, Bitch im Blazin.

I'm Like, Started With a Double Up.
Then a Nigga Tripled Up.
All From my mindframe, Cash Out or Get the Fuck.
Young Nigga Takeover, 80's Baby in this bitch.
Them Hoes for everybody im on my Juvenile Shit.
That Coach Rick Shit.
The Screamin Drive Um On Shit.
That hear that I'm the plug, get it out the mud shit.
Whip a 4 to a 9 shit.
Watch that microwave cook up a whole brick.
Coach Rick.
