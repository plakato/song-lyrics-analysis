Russian Roulette Lyrics
by Word A' Mouth.


I ain't scared to play. Let me see that. What you doin?
Your not playin this game right. You gotta spin it, spin it.
Just like that, spin the barrel. I'mma try it!
Spin the barrel! Watch I ain't scared. Watch this, watch! *gunshot*.

Thirstin Howl.
Poured blood, ignored love, even Thor trusted a little devil.
In all us, the motor that keeps cheatin wives, lawns cut.
At a fallen temperature before I'm even warmed up.
At the speed of thought, thug niggas fight for a needless cause.
All you hear is stop the stealing when nearin stores.
Uncommon Valour with the French make players take the bench.
Above the rim without touchin the net.
Thirsty, greedy, sometimes desperate.
When I lock rap down I'mma booby trap the exit.
Barracade the entrance, turn demonics screamin into harmless kids.
Whispers, no challengers.
Winnin the belt, if I say I'm top notch, I'd be just limitin myself.
MC's bore me like elevator music.
Street panhandlers with ?three-socket? sewage.
All A &amp; R's named Ufid.
If life's a bitch I'm one of her two kids.
A motherfucker, if the show fits.
If rap was a school I'd be teachin at Yale's institution.
Brooklyn hardrock, with a toothpick.
Threatenin your life and safety with new risk.
Scillionaire, after I burn MC's I give 'em.
Information on free clinic care.

You get one shot, one chance to bust.
Who bust first? first to get slain.
Playin Russian roulette.

Mr. Metaphor.
My lyrics sprout like a brussle, son.
I get you open like a ?claire-o? mussle, I might jam my knuckle.
Break it down raw like Brickface and stuck-o.
Eat you like a dick steak you fucko! *echoes*.
Whip you with my belt buckle, you wanna scuffle?
Pull your card while you suffer, I bag your bitch like a duffle.
And grill you like a ?wild nigga? fall like ?Allah fall?
I remove your tonsels I'm out for kids like youth hostiles.
Inhale force fires, blowin trees out my nostrils.
Diggin underground like carbon pipes outta fossils.
I wet you up like ponchos on a dark, stormy night.
And spark forty mics, I beat you up like forty dykes in Brooklyn.
You'll get taken, tooken for every nook and cranny.
I'll stick your daughter and the nanny, take your baby's candy.
Grab the brandy out the cabinet.
Take any found inhabitant and make his mind inadequate.
I spit my lyrics accurate, immaculate.
Its hard to capture it you don't got half my wit.
You better find an advocate to plead your rapture.
I leave your hands in the air, you leave in laughter.

Pumpkinhead.
I play roulette, with five bullets in the revolver.
The problem solver, rhyme evolver, descendent of Ghana.
Usin the marijuana to blaze niggas like lava.
Hot like sippin java in the sauna.
I'm cold blooded like iguanas.
My rhyme takes form, cock back the hammer on the biscuit.
I make stroms, the weather wizard, hordes to never visit.
Heaven's gimmicks, my arms cross in b-boy positionin.
Mix hydro with nitroglycerin.
Pose with the mic in the tie hold lyrics hard like pistol whippen.
I studied out the nigga mysticism.
And still quick to catch you like prince of principal medism vision.
I'm about to pull the trigger gotta make a quick decision.
The sweat drippin cloudin my wisdom, lost my religion.
I guess thats the cost of livin in this world.
With no girl, no jewels or pearls.
Confirmed my new script, my thoughts is suicidal sick.
I pull the trigger all I hear is a click.
My thoughts is sick, I pull the trigger all I hear was a *gunshot*.

Building Block.
Then I rise and shine from lies to blind the mind's eyes.
And ties that bind, you'll find your rhymes are dime-sized.
Compared to mine, you got no concepts.
Eatin from my table of contents take words out of my context.
My language is, like Arabic too complex.
Got you mixed like marriages.
My songs flex from my larynx, vex ya like a labyrinth.
I stab ya with, my daggerith, your haverith.
The Block hit, toxic material thats hazardous.
Ya bring life like Christ of Nazareth, then Lazarous.
Fabulous how I be rackin, presence to rap kiss.
In fact this radioactive flows that hold you captive.
Tracton's own home is where this rapper roams.
And catacombs, trap your poems and stay witcha like chaperones.
Control it with a dart like Napoleon Bonaparte.
You get stoned and sparked, bones and burn poems like Joan of Ark.
