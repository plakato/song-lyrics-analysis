Bus Ride Lyrics
by Quasimoto.


Uh oh, oh Madlib, here comes Old Willie, watch out! Skit continues throughout song.

Good evening misters, ladies.
Peace praise god a blessing to the race.
Speaking of love and peace and god;.
U know the bus.

Do you mind showing a little Christian kindness to me?
You can ask the Doctor I'm a serious case.
It's a medical emergency as you can see.
I ain't no addict, who ever heard of a junkie as old as me?
I just want my taste, how about it? no.
I ain't no dope addict, who ever heard of a junkie as old as me?

Madlib &amp; Quasimoto.
My story saddening, believe you me.
Just have a little pity.
Come on folks, got a little food for me?
Would you believe that a woman used to belong to me? Yup.
How about it please lay a little change on me.
Naw? I see, I see.

How about a little change, pretty please?
No? Hennessy Incredible Hulk.
Corona Heineken.
Bloody Mary Martinis.
Grey Goose Bach or Henny,.
Bravasier, Ripple, Night-train, Moonshine.
Johnny Walker Champagne, Brandy.
Red or White Wine.
Do you mind showing a little Christian kindness to me?
I ain't got nothing to hide.
You can ask the doctor I'm a serious case.
It's a medical emergency as you can see.
I ain't no addict, who ever heard of a junkie as old as me?

Skit Continues.
