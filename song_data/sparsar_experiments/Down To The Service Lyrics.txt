Down To The Service Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Got to the service and fell on my lazy.
My son, get out of here.
They don't want you so don't turn back.
Take away this gay U.S.
They wonder why I want to live.
I want to die, I want to take what's mine.
They always say, what went wrong my son.
Standing proud over you looking down.
Laughing like I only can.
Take my gun and I'll take away warm anything.
