Can't Cope Lyrics
by SWV.

I think he knows how I feel.
But his lady is my girl.
I don't want to pry.
And I can't hide what's inside.
Cause it's real.
I can leave it all the same.
But will it stop the pain?

I can't hold it in much longer.
The feeling's getting stronger.
The other day I saw him playing ball.
I wanted to throw him against the wall.
But then he'd know I lost my cool.
I cannot play the fool.

Somehow I gotta let you know.
I just can't cope.
It's always on my mind.
Your loving feeling.
Makes me think of you all the time.

You're so fine.

Somehow I gotta let you know.
I just can't cope.
It's always on my mind.
Your loving feeling.
Makes me think of you all the time.

You're so fine.

If I could get my nerve up, baby.
Then you will know the way I feel inside.
All this love.
I have is yours.
See, I never let it show.
So now I gotta let you know.

Somehow I gotta let you know.
It's always on my mind.
Gotta let you know.
No holding back this time.

I can't stand the pressure, baby.
These feelings coming over me.
I try to put it all behind.

Somehow I gotta let you know.
I just can't cope.
It's always on my mind.
Your loving feeling.
Makes me think of you all the time.

You're so fine.

Somehow I gotta let you know.
I just can't cope.
It's always on my mind.
Your loving feeling.
Makes me think of you all the time.

You're so fine.

You're so fine....
You're so fine....
You're so fine....
