Hok Kolorob হোক Lyrics
by Wonderstarz.


Stand up for JU.
What they did was right.
All they did was fight.
Against these motherfuckers.
Ought to protect our civil rights.
Where are they? At crossings on sunny days?
Wear Ray Bans, suckin' coconuts off the shade?
They call us nuts? They nuts.
Great, we vote ‘em and they show their mo'fuckin hate.
They workin' for us? Or we workin' for them?
It's an issue the people's ASO.
would like to raise.

সহ্য না করে, তুলেছ পায়ের ওপর পা.
হোক কলরব হোক, আটকাচ্ছে কারা.
আমরা ডাক দিলাম, দাওনি সাড়া.
তোদের হাত থেকে কেড়ে নেব আমরা power.
Free this country, we're gonna rise above hate.
আমাদের হাতে আছে তোদের fate.
বাড়ি ফিরতে দেব না, Hospital-এ লেটে দেব.
To figure this out, তোমাদের হতে হবে great.

VC? BC? সব-ই same.
এই rap-এ হয়তো কিছু হবেনা change.
But আমাদের fans রা misogynist না.
They feminist – they the best.
Twist their balls.
Until they learn to respect girls.
Forgot you came outta one perv.
Mazel tov, to all ‘em.
যারা respect every fuckin' dame-.
Schoolgirl, hussy, 5-0, cyprian.
They all ha' to earn their lives, dawgs.
They ain't bitches- you ain't dogs.
Oh wait, you are – inhuman.
fauna.
A vermin – poodle –.
Getting' killed in the dog house.
Focus! I ain't no rapist.
I am a rapper.
Might as well call me rappist.
As I'm givin' these fascists a Nazi treatment.
They gonna regret ‘em.
And until the end of time.
They gonna remember women !

Park Street, Delhi.
Politics and polydicks.
All connected.
In a malevolent web of.
shitheads.
Who think they heroes?
They zeroes.
So much evil in their veins.
Might need an antidote.
Fucks ‘em like they high, but they ain't.
I'm stone cold, livin' on rum cake.
But this shit – this ain't for OGs.
Even in my eyes this a li'l OOC.
Oh Bee, what up in this city.
Damn, vulgar criminals mix that with cocktease.
City of Joy? Rhymes with City of Piss.
Degraded decadence like Gotham under Arkham City.
Loco? Coke – oh! People goin'.
cuckoo.
Over many-a-girl over 32? Boo!
They go: “We don't need you.
We can govern ourselves.
Yes, talkin' to you!”.
On Enfield, paid boots – screw you!
You were meant to protect us all.
Now it's all on you.
