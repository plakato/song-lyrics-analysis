Antidote (Radio Edit) Lyrics
by Swedish House Mafia.

Don't stop, turn that up, take it higher.
Take this mother up, start a riot.
Don't stop, turn that up, take it higher.
Take this mother up, start a riot.
There's a glitch inside my system.
Rushing through my whole existence.
Got me twisted, can't resist this.
Something's flipping all my switches.
Take'em, break'em, make'em feel it.
Mix it up and mass appeal it.
Pressure is riding me hard.
Killer dose right through my heart.
And there's no antidote.
And there's no antidote.
And there's no antidote.
And there's no antidote.
There's no antidote.
