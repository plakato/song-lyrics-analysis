Luna Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


These ghosts in my head tell me I should be dead.
Why did I, why did i leave her there?
How could I, how could I feel so bare?
Noises pierce the air, cry out for what's not there.
Why did I, why did I even care?
How could I, how could I think it's fair?

Stop where you're going, I don't wanna know it.
These days I fall.
And when you scratch at my window, going to the tempo.
Well, it hurts my side, yeah.
All of the tight ends slowly start to loosen.
This pain descends.
And when the body's fully gone now, it drops to the low ground.
And all the pain is dead.
