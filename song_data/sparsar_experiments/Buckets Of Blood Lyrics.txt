Buckets Of Blood Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

Leave me here to suffer.
In my own madness.
I prefer this painful silence.
I won't stop until there's blood, blood, blood, blood.

Leave me here to battle.
Through my regression.
As I descend into obsession.
I won't stop until there's buckets of blood.

Sure I know I will bleed.
Until there's nothing more of me.
This time left for dead.
With just the demons in my head.

Leave me here to wallow.
In my delusions.
With these phantoms I'll find conclusions.
I won't stop until there's blood, blood, blood, blood.

Leave me here to struggle.
Through heathen theories.
Of this disease I have grown weary.
I won't stop until there's buckets of blood.

Sure I know I will bleed.
Until there's nothing more of me.
This time left for dead.
With just the demons in my head.

What fatal flaw has us enthralled.
What terrible twist has us recall.
Somebody must pay.
For this mortal decay.

Blood.
Blood.
Blood.
Blood.
Blood.
Blood.
Blood.

Sure I know I will bleed.
Until there's nothing more of me.
This time left for dead.
With just the demons in my head.

What fatal flaw has us enthralled.
What terrible twist has us recall.
Somebody must pay.
For this mortal decay.
