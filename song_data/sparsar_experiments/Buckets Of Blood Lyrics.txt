Buckets Of Blood Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

Leave me here to suffer
In my own madness
I prefer this painful silence
I won't stop until there's blood blood blood. Blood

Leave me here to battle
Through my regression
As I descend into obsession
I won't stop until there's buckets of blood

Sure. I know I will bleed
Until there's nothing more of me
This time left for dead
With, just the demons in my head

Leave me here to wallow
In my delusions
With. These phantoms I'll find conclusions
I won't stop until there's blood blood blood. Blood

Leave me here to struggle
Through heathen theories
Of. This disease I have grown weary
I, won't stop until there's buckets of blood

Sure. I know I will bleed
Until there's nothing more of me
This time left for dead
With. Just the demons in my head

What fatal flaw. Has us enthralled
What terrible twist. Has us recall
Somebody must pay
For this mortal decay

Blood
Blood
Blood
Blood
Blood
Blood
Blood

Sure. I know I will bleed
Until there's nothing more of me
This time left for dead
With. Just the demons in my head

What fatal flaw has us enthralled
What terrible twist. Has us recall
Somebody must pay
For this mortal decay
