Not Like We Used To Lyrics
by Swelo.

Oh we're not.
Like we used to be.
Yeah.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.
Oh.

You've got all.
Your new lovers.
I've got all.
My new friends.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.
Yeah.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.
Oh.

I've got all.
These new lovers.
You've got all.
Your new friends.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.

Take me back.
To those days.

Take me back.
To those days.

Take me back.
To those days.

But we're not.
Like we used to be.
Yeah.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.
No.

We've got all.
These new lovers.
We've got all.
Our new friends.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.

No we're not.
Like we used to be.

We've got all.
These new lovers.
All these new friends.
Can't go back.
To how it used to be.
