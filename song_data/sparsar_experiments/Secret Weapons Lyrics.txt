Secret Weapons Lyrics
by The Undergods.

Canibus 
I'm a Gold Card member, I buy weapons from local guitar, centers 
The Undergod bomb, your shelter, 
The Celsius melt your face off the hundred bar arc welder 
Alpha. Bravo, Charlie Delta Hamburger, Helper 
Chinese stealth, fighter F-35 Joint Striker 
I built a two man glider, just like it, 
Canibus Crazy, Ivan psychic kamikaze pilot 
Diving into the Sun like a suicidal comet, 
Celestial knowledge. Ninety three million in mileage, 
The Undergods, don't need Verizon to talk to Osiris 
Don't. Ask us to talk about it. If you doubt it 
It's too late to elaborate plus, I was sworn to a oath of silence. 
Lava gushing out the top of the mountain 
Lightning strike. The top of the tower destroy electric power, 
Cost, a trillion dollars an hour radiation, rail-guns, 
Complete, electronic and digital failure. 
So trash your cellulars. Nobody coming to help us 
It's up to the elders to get the children to the shelters, 
Bullet train, Germaine crawl in and out of the storm drains 
To slay gargoyles in gods, name, 
Tarantula, heart fuselage, smaller than a Concorde plane, 
I crush your skull like a Concord Grape 
Major Ed Dames ordered the Undergods to Bogart all lanes 

Lockheed Martin competition ducking and dodging 
Daisy cutter rockets blow up your fucking apartment, 
Undergod, Spartans research and development department, 
Canibus and Keith Murray, smart-bombing, all targets, 
 
Break, Canibus 
Just another day at the office, 
The underground Undergods power is sovereign: that's Keith, Murray, calling 
Yo what up? Keith 
 
Samples 
Keith Murray, 
Samples, 
, 
Canibus 
This ain't, what they expected: 
Blindside deckin' jaw, wreckin' 
For, those who sidelined hecklin', 
Raw metaphors for those who checkin' 
Get to steppin' before we hafta' use our secret weapons
