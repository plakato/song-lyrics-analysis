Checks & Balances (Intro) Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


White bitches and palaces.
Checks and balances.
You want the money and the power?
You want the money and the power?
Gold diggers and statuses.
Checks and balances.
You want the money and the power?
You want the money and the power.

Well I'm back to lay that crack down ‘til you flatline.
Give it to you ‘til you overdose like the @ sign.
These niggas in their raps lying ‘bout their background.
I tell ‘em put a sock in it like mankind.
My whole city ran down, niggas poor.
Ain't no bitches getting tanlines, we at war.
Drug money on the floor, police knocking at the door.
Tired of running from the pigs, man that shit is such a bore.
Snore , I want more, coach call my number.
I'ma score, trying to be rich by the summer.
But of course, I need a bad bitch for the winter.
Who know why clef gotta be gone 'til November.
Man, artist, saint, sinner, and an innovator.
Narcissist and achiever – Massina.
And fuck the other side, man that's just my demeanor.
Cause fake grass always greener, I need the-.

Understand I know my roots, I'm a descendant-.
Of Uncle Sam &amp; Uncle Luke – money and bitches.
Pussy and riches, that's all a nigga ever wanted.
Conscious of critics but I'm just basking in the moment.
Me and my homies, we trying to make it through the plight.
Sometimes you got to choose a vice so you can make it through the night.
Niggas popping pills, man these niggas sniffing white.
I just stick to the pot like rice – Christ!
All this ice, I bought the Jesus piece so I could justify the price.
Lord I know that I ain't right, and I know that I ain't white.
But I'm still coming for my slice.
Even if I gotta take it like I'm Martin, that's just life – right?
Been M.I.A. at the church.
But I've been making it work.
Planted feet, ain't no taking my turf.
Fuck the world then skeet on the face of the earth.
