Checks & Balances (Intro) Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


White bitches and palaces 
Checks and balances 
You want the money and the power 
You want the money and the power 
Gold diggers and statuses, 
Checks and balances. 
You want the money and the power 
You want the money and the power 
 
Well. I'M back to lay that crack down ‘til you flatline 
Give it to you ‘til. You overdose, like the @ sign, 
These niggas in their raps lying ‘bout, their background 
I tell ‘em, put a sock in it like mankind. 
My whole city ran down niggas poor 
Ain't, no bitches getting tanlines. We at war 
Drug money on the floor police, knocking at the door 
Tired of running from the pigs man. That shit is such a bore. 
Snore. I want more coach call my number 
I'ma score, trying to be rich by the summer 
But. Of course I need a bad bitch for the winter. 
Who know why clef got ta be gone'til November 
Man artist, saint sinner and an innovator, 
Narcissist and achiever – Massina, 
And, fuck, the other side, man, that's just my demeanor 
Cause fake grass, always greener. I need the- 
 
Understand. I know my roots, I'm a descendant- 
Of Uncle Sam
