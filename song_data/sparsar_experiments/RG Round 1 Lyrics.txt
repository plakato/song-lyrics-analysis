RG Round 1 Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

Man does it feel good to be back.
Alright.
Yo.

You guys thought I died, but now I'm back to bring stuff to diss you.
6x sent my soul back down like, Nah we we're just fucking with you.
Got called up, was starting JV but now I'm varsity.
Adrenaline flows through my arteries man am I gonna be hard to beat.
My new name is opportunity and curiosity.
Cuz I come knocking and kill you cats with animalistic ferocity.
God I'm gonna drop a beat.
It starts to bleed, stop the leak.
Call police, of course Drive Slow isn't me at my top speed.
Man am I on point.
To listen you'd probably blow dudes.
I just had a cold at the cuckoo's nest but I'm over one flew.
Tunes if Pac saw you biting him he'd think of you like he did Nas.
I'll call you .357 because I'm against all odds.
Laying down the base, God looking down at my face.
Chasing first place.
My skin is white though, so fuck a race!
Reaching for the cleaver.
Make an atheist a believer.
Bringing flames to ignite the fumes from my last round's ether.
