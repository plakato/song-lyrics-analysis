Hold On Lyrics
by Amber Coffman.

Oh, yeah, I see you, baby  .
Hold on, I'm coming  .
  .
We don't have to talk about it  .
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing  .
Ain't no one here  .
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute  .
.
I know you'll understand it  .
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing  .
Oh, yeah, I see you, baby  .
Hold on, I'm coming  .
Hold on, hold on  .
Hold on, hold on  .
? a lady  .
  .
You're the only one here  .
  .
Ain't no one here  .
Hold on, hold on  .
Hold on.
I know you'll understand it  .
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute  .
We don't have to talk about it  .
You're the only one here  .
? a lady  .
