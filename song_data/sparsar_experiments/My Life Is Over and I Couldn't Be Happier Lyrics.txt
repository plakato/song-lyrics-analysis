My Life Is Over and I Couldn't Be Happier Lyrics
by Pup.

I don't even know why you're so pissed
You said I'm such a piece of shit
That wasn't subtle at all

Maybe, I deserve more credit than you gave. Me
Say I'll, never learn, and it's never gon na phase me
It doesn't phase me at all

If. I came home right now
What. Would I find out 

I'm at the end of my tether
You're under my skin, and I'm letting it fester
Yeah I've had enough

Stumble out and I'm headed for the van
I can't drive man. I can barely stand
Forget getting it. Up

I bet you faked it all along
And. I bet you never missed me at all
I'm still waiting, I'm not moving on

If, I came home right now
What. Would I find out 

You won't believe me
