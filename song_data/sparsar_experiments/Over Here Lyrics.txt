Over Here Lyrics
by Ruste Juxx.


Juxx's right, write rhymes every day.
Rapping at buck town USA.
Got guns, that's what it says on my black T.
Clapping at the cops when they tryina axe me.
Homicide is like breathing in my hood.
Killing, robbing, straight thieving in my hood.
Blood thirst, throw your body in a black hearse.
Crown ice, niggas wow, we react worse.
Killer cartel entertainment production.
I ain't made the beat, I'm just known for corruption.
Expressing my imperialism, rusty jokes, all I do is spark magnetism.
Haze in my lungs while I'm blazing the drums.
Shooting niggas, I ain't just raising my gun.
Subterranean flow, this underground rap shit.
When that four pound clap.

Train wreck in my blunt, Ciroc on deck.
Niggas act stupid, I'mma flame that tech.
Like murder, you can get bodied over here.
Like murder, nigga, you can get bodied over here.
Train wreck in my blunt, Ciroc on deck.
Niggas act stupid, I'mma flame that tech.
Like murder, you can get bodied over here.
Like murder, nigga, you can get bodied over here.

Big time jokes, I'm the mastermind.
Bodies, fake rappers just to pass the time.
I don't got kilos, but I'll take yours.
Never found guilty, but I break laws.
Overpower the masses, I tell â€˜em what they want.
Then I take money, money, money and straight stunt.
I drop a single with a cell like hot case.
Might bust a bottle on top of a cop face.
Earned my respect, real niggas recognize me.
That's why my pussy enemies still despise me.
Keeping with a hammer on me, about to bang out.
Two bodies drop when them shots rang out.
Witnesses none so no court cases.
Victory after victory, I'm pulling out aces.

Train wreck in my blunt, Ciroc on deck.
Niggas act stupid, I'mma flame that tech.
Like murder, you can get bodied over here.
Like murder, nigga, you can get bodied over here.
Train wreck in my blunt, Ciroc on deck.
Niggas act stupid, I'mma flame that tech.
Like murder, you can get bodied over here.
Like murder, nigga, you can get bodied over here.

I'm the last motherfucker that you ever wanna fuck with.
We like the whole lockdown.
Take these words home and think it through.
Keep it grinding.
Oh, shit.
