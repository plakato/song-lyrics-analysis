Angela Lyrics
by Univore.

Victor's taking Monica.
Michael's taking Pam.
But nobody has asked me.
So I'm stuck here shaking hands.

I'll never be the apple of anyone's eye.
'till the girls can see the beauty that's buried inside.

Britney's looking beautiful.
Though she's pregnant as can be.
Her dress wrapped round her tummy-tum.
So that everyone can see.

She never tried seducing the basketball team.
Finding a boy wasn't hard for the homecoming queen?

I will be asking Angela.
She is so divine.
I will make her mine.
I've got a shot with Angela.
She's desperate for a boy.
And I am a boy.

Now Angela is broken for.
She's accompanying Hakeem.
He asked her over breakfast.
She blushed and then agreed.

Now out in the cold, the loneliest fool ever then.
Rented tuxedo and wilted corsage in my hand.

I will be taking Angela.
She's with someone else.
I'm all by myself.
He will be dancing with Angela.
They will fall in love.
It's in the stars above.
