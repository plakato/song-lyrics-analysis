A Statue of a Fool Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


I got ta, be honest with y'all. You know, 
I kinda hesitated on this one. You know 
Don't, nobody like pointing out they own flaws and shit 
But. You know I do feel the message you know: 
So I'ma try to see if I can sacrifice a lil' ego. 
Speak, the truth, you know ha-ha 
, 
Yung, Ro 
Forgave me once forgave me twice and I fucked up 
Forgave me again and I still fucked up 
And. Now I see we both fucked up 
Me for being me and you for loving a fuck up, 
But ay. What'S up cause girl, ain't, no love lost 
If anything gained you hearing that from my mouth, 
And yeah. I feel bad about the scars. I left ya. 
You walk around with a chip on your shoulder, keep ya head up; 
Cause, there's love after love cool. We didn't work out 
But I wasn't ready. Then I still got thangs. I'M trying to work out. 
I know ya, miss Yung Ro. I bet you think I forgot ya 
Saw ya picture yesterday and shed a solid tear about ya 
My girl to be you meant the world to me 
Now here I am confessing. I want the world to see 
An example, who knows might help someone else. 
I lost love, but worst of all, I made a fool of myself: that's game, 
 
Somewhere, whole world. You know 
Every ghetto, every city, every country, you know 
Well fuck it. You know we taking this shit worldwide. 
Just. Look at this as my stone break it down. For'Em 
What else a man 
 hold on to it
