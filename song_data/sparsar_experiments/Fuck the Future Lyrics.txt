Fuck the Future Lyrics
by United Nations.

Stop. Start.
You're the crossing guard.
Fist fight in the living room.
Fuck the future now.
Everyday I sing your praise.
Every night I burn in your front yard.
Forget what you heard.
Follow, follow.
Fuck the future.
I seen it all before.
I know the future.
I will return.
I've seen it before.
I've seen you fuck the future, guy.
