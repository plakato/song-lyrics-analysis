What Mattered Most Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


I thought I knew the girl so well.
If she was sad I couldn't tell.
I missed the point, I missed the signs.
So if she's gone the fault is mine.
I know, I know a whole lot of little things.
And even though I confess them one by one.
She would still be gone.

Her eyes are blue, her hair is long.
In '64 she was born in Baton Rouge.
Her favorite song is In My Life.
I memorized her every move.
I knew her books, her car, her cloths.
But I paid no attention to what mattered most.

I never asked, she never said.
And when she cried I turned my head.
She dreamed her dreams behind closed doors.
That made them easy to ignore.
And I know, I know I missed the forest for the trees.
And all I have to show oh when she walked out the door.
The cold facts and nothing more.

Her eyes are blue, her hair is long.
In 64 she was born in Baton Rouge.
Her father's tall, her mother's gone.
She moved out west when she was two.
The way she laughed, the way she loved.
Oh my God what did I do.
