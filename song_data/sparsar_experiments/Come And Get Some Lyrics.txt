Come And Get Some Lyrics
by SWV.


Check it out.
What's crackulating? It's finna get boisterous. Sisters With Voices. And you.
heard of me.
Straight from the V, E-40 Fonzarelli.

Turn the lights down low.
And come lay next to me.
I wanna fill your night up baby.
With passion and ecstasy, yeah.

Come and get some of my lovin'.
What I got is outta sight.
Come and get some of my lovin'.
I wanna ride ya all night.
Come and get some of my lovin'.
What I gotta is outta sight.
Come and get some of my lovin'.
I wanna do you all night.

Ooh baby, baby, baby.
You got me soaking wet.
Lay on your back now baby.
So I can.
I just wanna hear ya moan.
Up and down, round and round.
It's alright.
Close your eyes, don't be shy.
Just lay back and enjoy this ride.

Might not be fax machine.
But I got a little bit of paper.
Mix your Coko with my 40 ounce.
Let's make a Boiler Maker.
My thing-a-majig be straight up on swole.
Like I'm fresh outta the pen.
Wearing a uniform, standing at attention.
Perking on some of that ruby red grapefruit juice gin.
And must I mention?
It leans to the side like the Eiffel Tower nice and naughty.
Nigga talkin' about, Who the hell he think he is?
Ron high tower or some damn body?
It ain't no slipping in your tycoon playboys partner's limping.
After the club you can me and my dudes up in the parking lot Sasquash pimping.
Ballers tactics, up outta the Yay all damn day.
What's up with mattress?
Let display my survey.
We can kinda like take our time and do some ole' nice and slow.
About two and half hours of romantic business.
Or we can hurry up and do some Speedy Gonzalez.
Betta get your rock off before your daddy get home in 20 minutes.
Smell me on this one.
Sneaking out of windows.
Hoping over backyard fences.
Off the hinges is E Feezy Fonzareezy.
Trying to spit came at Taj and Lelee.
SWV.

Breakdown:.

So much joy yeah, ooh.

I know you will enjoy, come on, come on.
