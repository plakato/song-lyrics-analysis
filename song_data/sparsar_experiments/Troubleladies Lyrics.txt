Troubleladies Lyrics
by Twisted Artistics.


Rolling up in the spot, who other than jezebel?
Liquor-breath from hell.
Looks to cast a spell.
Chaos wrapped in makeup with high heels.
Hardly dresses, wanting to know how I feel.
'bout a dance and a drink in advance on my tab.
Spending some cash on my expense, then ride a cab.
And romance on some one night stand, just like that.
No offense but despite what plans you might have had.
Girl, you're now dealing with a monk.
No matter what kinda junk you got in the trunk.
And though the things I say hurt your dome.
I really don't mean to cast the first stone.
But I ain't gonna go get up and chase after no scank-ho.
Free-for-all-chicks looking for me to spend dough.
Need to take a break and slow down the tempo.
Cause that whole entire charade; that can't go.

ancient serpent, subtle snake he's.
Steady, heavy working through them trouble-ladies.
Have 'em barking at you like a dog with rabies.
Have 'em spending dough like they're stuck in the eighties.
ancient serpent, subtle snake he's.
Steady, heavy working through them trouble-ladies.
Have 'em barking at you like a dog with rabies.
Have 'em spending dough.

Stuck in her tracter-beam, she's got him on a leash.
Sucker's wrapped around her finger on his knees.
Compromising with his innermost beliefs.
Bazooka-packing cupid steady showing teeth.
Like a water closet he's taking her crap.
She's got a man trying hard to please her, breaking his back.
Can't understand how he could let his integrity go.
But oh, then he's reminded the very second she show.
Beauty queen type thing, easy on the eye.
Like everything he feens for personified.
And when she's been with him  feels like he's gonna die.
Head's like a spinner-rim that won't quit on a guy.
Love does you blind, it may alter your will.
And drain your aims, blurr your mind, be aware, what you deal.
With ain't no plain prima donna once you get into the matter.
Same spirit wanted Johns' head on a platter.
