All the Pretty Horses Lyrics
by Unknown.

Hush-a-bye don't you cry.
Go to sleep-y, little baby.
When you wake you shall have.
All the pretty little horses.
Blacks and bays, dapple grays.
Coach and six white horses.
Hush-a-bye don't you cry.
Go to sleep-y, little baby.

Way down yonder, down in the meadow.
There's a poor little lambie.
Bees and the butterflies pecking out his eyes.
Poor lambie cried for his mammy.
So hushaby, don't you cry.
Go to sleepy little baby.

Way out yonder.
Down in the meadow.
Poor little baby crying Mama.
Birds and butterflies.
Flutter 'round your eyes.
Poor little baby crying Mama.
