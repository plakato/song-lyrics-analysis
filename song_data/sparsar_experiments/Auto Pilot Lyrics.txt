Auto Pilot Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


Saw you lying there on the marble slab.
The best trip that I've ever had.
Higher than a jet plane, pass it around.
My drinks on empty, need another round.

I want to fly, want to ride with you.
Is this the best that you can do?
I want to fly, want to ride with you.
High up in a jet plane with you.

Will we arrive in the middle of nowhere.
Don't act like you know, I been here so many times.
I never seen you before.
But now that I have, I don't want to see you no more.

High up in a jet plane with you.
High up in a jet plane with you.

Ah-ah, auto pilot no control.
Ah-ah, ah.
Ah-ah, auto pilot no control.
Ah-ah, ah.

High up in a jet plane with you.
High up in a jet plane with you.

Fly, fly, fly away.
