Faster Gun Lyrics
by The Wrens.


Five state-school lots.
Five girls in cars.
That thing we know.
The whole township lost, but.

Maybe it's lust.
Maybe run luck.
I'll man the bed.
Hammer out love.

Snow scenes level lonely bastards.
Eight feet of earth.
The whole thing suddenly worth.
A faster gun.
A faster gun.
A faster gun.
Right now.

A black jetty rock.
Rock splitter's shot.
Saddle creek stars.
I miss them a lot, but.

The cable-car heights.
Cable snaps right.
Each devil out.
Out fighting fights.

Snow scenes level lonely bastards.
Eight feet of earth.
The whole thing suddenly worth.
A faster gun.
A faster gun.
A faster gun.
A main motor down.
And no shot left at the crown.
A faster gun.
A faster gun.
A faster gun.
A faster gun.
Right now.
