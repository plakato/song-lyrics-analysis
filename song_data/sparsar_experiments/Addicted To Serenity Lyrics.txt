Addicted To Serenity Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Here I am.
Just a poor boys dream.
My life's lost in trouble.
You know what I mean.
Knowing the gutter.
There ain't no escape.
Life has no offers just my body is raped.

All my broken promises.
Intentions that have failed.
Helped me cross the borderline.
All the screaming memories.
That I wasted in my life.
Creeping death is gonna shine.

I am lost but I will find.
Just a little piece of mind.
To keep my self back in control.
Will it ever be the same.
The syrenge is calling out my name.
See myself I am addicted.
To serenity.

Wasted time.
For a shot to come.
The bigger they are.
The more I'm done.
Sacred feelings.
There ain't no return.
Suicide solution.
In hell I will burn.
