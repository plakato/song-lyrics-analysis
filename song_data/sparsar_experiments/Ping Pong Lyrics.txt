Ping Pong Lyrics
by UNDERSCORE.

Into: OVR.

Not again.

Whipping my wrist look like macaroni.
I'm not your friend, you a jabroni.
I'm with the gang, that's that bologna.
I skate on a brick, I'm looking like tony.
I'm whipping my wrist, it's looking like ping pong.
I'm at the top if the W, looking like King Kong.
Whipping my wrist, I'm playing ping pong.
I got a Grammy but now I'm going for the tony.

Ten bands on my neck, damn I got finessed.
I'm running to the checks.
No nikes when I flex.
I got a yacht, I'm going for the jet.
I've gotta go, man I gotta jet.
You coulda had a check.
You shoulda had a check.
One hundred thirty thousand on my neck.
Twenty thousand on your head.
I'm flexing I'm flexing I'm balling.
I ball so hard I got suspended.
Forty thousand, that's in debt.
I shoulda stopped spending when I flex.

Walk in the trap, I turn on the stove.
I'm whipping the bricks for Tony.
I pack it all up, into the trunk.
You know I flex in the Honda.
Stupid ass nigga, stupid ass nigga.
You think that you got my rolex.
Joke is on you, joke is on you.
The rolex you got is bologna.
You're phony like Kony.
You're mad because your TV is Sony.
Whipping my wrist, Whipping my wrist.
You wanted a brick? Call me Chef Alfatony.
Bee-Boo-Bee-Bop, I got the mop.
Boo-Boo ass nigga, Fu-Fu ass nigga.
Bologna Boys.

Bologna Boys.
Hit you with that toy.
Bologna Boys.
Hit you with that toy.

Ping pong party with some bitches in the lobby.
Ping pong 4x.
Ching chong ding dong wing wong.
My things long.
That bitch, she wrong.
I'm a rich buddy in the trap with some sloppy toppy.
I pull up in a Bentley.
Or I pull up in a masi.
I'm no civilian, the way I'm killing them.
Tony pull up to the trap.
I'm whipping these children back.
I'm Mussolini with that lean.
And I whip like I'm Katrina.
I pull up in a Bugatti.
Or a Maserati.
Just like I'm Gandhi.
Peace be with you.
And Reese's peanut butter cups.
I'm bout to erupt.
Like a volcano.
In a Dodge Durango.
I lost my chain.
Just like I'm Django.
And Quavo.
Sippin that mango.
My life's a movie.
I'm on fandango.
And bang bros.

Aye somebody tell me what the fuck it is.
Why these boys got Sony TVs in 2015.
What the fuck's going on?
I'm going to call Tony on-.
You know what? I'm going to call Tony on their bitch ass.
I'm going to call Tony.
Don't make me- You know what I'm calling Tony.
I'm calling Tony.

-Dial tone-.

Interlude: Tony.
Press three if you want a Honda.
Press five if you want a brick.
If you're looking for Tony, don't worry about it.

-Beat change-.

I've got a Rolex on my wrist.
Looking like Muhammad Ali.
23 karrat gold.
Plated on my rari.
Drop 20 stacks.
Just on a track with Mommy.
Go check the books.
Tell my account sorry.
Drop 200k on a Porsche.
Just to say fuck Meek Mill.
Diamonds on my teeth.
Feeling like a sheik.
CPR training course.
Fuck your remorse.
Fuck your awards.
And fuck your jorts.
Drop one single.
Now the whole school wants a jingle.
Thinking they can hop on a track.
Boy I'll cut you back.
The only reason we rapping.
Is because we're lacking.
On other things to do.
So we're bored as fuck.
Thinkin what we gonna do?
Hmm, lets do a track.
Ok, with all of you?
It was Me, Owen, Jair and Devante.
So we pull out the mic.
And find a beat.
Write down some words.
Thinking this gon be neat.
So we drop our first track.
Now we the Bologna boys.
With kids asking for features.
We're like, no but suck my wiener.
But honestly don't think we're serious.
Because this is all for fun.
We don't really try.
So, goodbye.

-Young Thug Noises-.

God damn, them Bologna Boys still going in.
God damn, man I fucked up the kitchen that's a sin.
Whipping, that's a sin.
At having fun we always win.
Drop me off in Mexico I'm gonna break this brick, no Jackie Chan.

You got finessed man, you got tricked again.
9+10 no 19.
Fuck a trap queen, all I need my.
left wrist Irene and my my right hand plug in Belize.
No sprite for me no lean.
I'd rather have tea, my cup so sick it's so green.
I pull up to the spot in a topless masi or I might just pull up in that Boris.
Bidjan Ferrari.
I am deeply sorry that bologna got you worried.
Hit up my jeweler he said he pissed on my neck.
My teller she said she's pissed she cashing checks.
I love the gang, I love the squad, shout out to Tony, my connect.

I call my man Nick cause he stay with the Cannon.
I don't fuck with opps, And i'm tryna stay out of the slammer.
I pull up, I think that I am Tony Montana.
Pull up in a boat, it's looking like a banana.
No squares in my circle you looking like a waffle house.
Pull up on the block I hit you with that.
Oops.
Ouch.

Stop it, Craig.
I said stop it.
One ton brick.
Two ton brick.
Three ton brick.
Four ton brick.
I will get the 5th when I fuck your bitch.
Don't make me turn you into a stick.
I'm fucking rich.
Bitch, I'm broke.
I drive a Honda, I sell dope.
Me and Tony done drove to the store.
Smoking on that Dro.
We are fucking hoes.
Kick the bitch out, because she's got an afro.
Tony was like: Bitch you got to go.
We were still moving when she got kicked out the door.
I was like: Oh.
Let's keep it rolling.
Too many hoes, got two cell phones.
And I keep a third, just for Tony.
Fuck you niggas who ain't down for bologna.
I'm a keep it thorough, I'm a call Tony.
I'm done with you niggas, because all you niggas phony.
Bitch what the fuck, bitch you better duck.
Fucking red neck, you don't pay rent.
You live in a mother-fucking tent.
Shit.
Where am I?

You think we're playing games, but this ain't ping pong.
You think I rap good but, I can also sing songs.
You think I was at your door, but this ain't ding dong.
You think I'm off the loud, but I'm really ching chong.

Pause, wait a minute.
You thought I was tripping off that syrup?
You thought I was leaning because I'm coffin?
But I ain't dead yet.
Oh.
You thought I meant that coughing nah nah.
Lean.
Only for medical use though.
Cut my pig right.
Right in my bologna circle.
Devante, Owen, Samuel.
Bologna boys smoking crack.
Eat ALL your apple jacks.
Call in the man tony.
Purchase the boys Hondas.
He defeated Kony.
Flexin on you Mamas.
Forget those Rolex's.
Who needs a Rolex's.
When we have our main man.
TONY!
Making trips back and forth.
Like we're playing ping pong.
Getting tips for what it's worth.
Got no money?
Move along.
Tony this fool is broke.
After all those favors.
His neck will do the choke.
Chomp like alligators.

Tapered up that's for certain.
