A Love That Never Was Lyrics
by The Zombies.

Drifting in a void.
Contemplating nothing.
Thinking of a love that never was.

Images of red.
Weeping from her sun.
Memories of a love that never was.

And there is nothing there.
No one needs to cry.
No one wonders why my face is lonely now.
A face that lives a lie.

Living in a dream.
Fake hallucination.
Thinking of a love that never was.

Lying in my bed.
Gazing into nothing.
Memories of a love that never was.

And there is nothing there.
No one needs to cry.
No one wonders why my face is lonely now.
My face that lives a lie.

Living in a dream.
Fake hallucination.
Thinking of a love that never was.
