I do what I want Lyrics
by Zoddex.

Ok my name is ZDX, and I love.
doing this, and I do love sex.
I'm locked in bless, I'm kinda tired, let me catch a breast.
I mean my breath, and yes I'm mean, I demand respect, and I never sweat.
Cuz I only bet that I'm the one and the only, from there to here.
I'm accounting every cent, cuz I worth colones, yes cuz I'm still.
Costarican.
Like when I started doing this I stopped being a fan, c'mon take a blunt.
Smoked with a lighter, trained with a fighter, and fucked with a partner.
Drinked all the water, and debt kicks harder and I'm still on.

I do what I want, and I do what I like you already know that.
At least for a change, let me roll a pack and yeah I'm sharp as a tack.
And strong as a rock, and my heart is gone, and my brain is a.
phone.
I'm never alone, I run with a lot, they kept me on top, guess I never said.
thanks.
But I do love y'all, I do love y'all.
Sometimes I smile, sometimes I cry, don't ask me why, cuz I don't know why.
My girl is gone, and my homes are high, and I just want a piece of the pie.
Give me some cake, this is my day, never knew the strength of a pray.
And I still don't buy all the bullshit that this motherfucking bitches say.

Keep going hard; keep connecting dots, homicidal flow while I go.
This beat so mad, I feel I'm home, spitting fire like a dragoon.
Boom and I'm now on the moon, I could start a war, and be hero on guitar.
But I want this, cuz this is me, I'm sick, I'm ill I'm tnt.
And I might explode; you will lose your hope, ima die on dope.
I'm bulletproof, this is the life I choose, I'm still on top and I never lose.

I do what I want, and I do what I like you already know that.
At least for a change, let me roll a pack and yeah I'm sharp as a tack.
And strong as a rock, and my heart is gone, and my brain is a phone.
I'm never alone, I run with a lot, they kept me on top, guess I never said.
thanks.
But I do love y'all, I do love y'all.
Sometimes I smile, sometimes I cry, don't ask me why, cuz I don't know why.
My girl is gone, and my homes are high, and I just want a piece of the pie.
Give me some cake, this is my day, never knew the strength of a pray.
And I still don't buy all the bullshit that this motherfucking bitches say.

Don't say my name; I'm not your friend.
And I be damned, I live in hell, that's why my clothes smell like smoke.
I don't do coke, but I do revoke, your life as is.
Call me Mr. Assassin, my blood is green, and I'm passing.
I'm still harassing, my car is gone, I'm walking dead.
I'm backwards up, I kinda insane, my money too.
Didn't go thru, but is ok, my swag gone talk, hear what it say.
Another way, a shiny day, a bitch that I could plug and play.
Another single I can make and you don't even have to pay.

I do what I want, and I do what I like you already know that.
At least for a change, let me roll a pack and yeah I'm sharp as a tack.
And strong as a rock, and my heart is gone, and my brain is a.
phone.
I'm never alone, I run with a lot, they kept me on top, guess I never said.
thanks.
But I do love y'all, I do love y'all.
Sometimes I smile, sometimes I cry, don't ask me why, cuz I don't know why.
My girl is gone, and my homes are high, and I just want a piece of the pie.
Give me some cake, this is my day, never knew the strength of a pray.
And I still don't buy all the bullshit that this motherfucking bitches say.
