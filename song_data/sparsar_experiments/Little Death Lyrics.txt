Little Death Lyrics
by +44.


Please sleep, my darling, sleep.
The cry for inspiration never reaches ears on distant stars.

And I won't pretend I understand....

Please sleep, my darling, sleep.
Your death by information won't disturb the peace on distant stars.
And Even when you lock the door and slide behind the unlit shades.
None of us are strangers anymore.

So fall asleep with the windows open.
Come to me with the worst you've said and done.
You'll close your eyes and see me.

I stand no chance at all.

Please sleep, my darling, sleep.
Your car crash in slow-motion won't upset the pace on distant stars.
And one by one the years of our lives stumble as the moments pass.
So please hold on... please hold on....

Please sleep my darling, sleep.
Please sleep my darling, sleep.
