Ding Dong Song Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.


95 South and them Boyz 69.
Prepare for the stabbin' cause it's Ding-a-Ling time!
It ain't no interruption, so please unplug the phone.
And get ready for the stabbin' from the Ding-a-Ling Song!
Ding-ding-dong-a-ding-ding-da-dong-dong, hooh, da-dat, da-dat, da-dat.

Jay-Ski:.
Yeah, 69 Boyz in the house, b'lieve dat!
Backed up by the 95 South, and it goes like this, c'mon!

Ding ding dong a-ding ding da-dong dong, huh, true dat! True dat! True.
Dat!

The Rotweiller and Thrill Da Playa.
RW Yo, don't try to fake the funk on.
Go on, give you ya milk-bone; the ding-dong.
So mangy kitty-cat, get back, get back, get back, get back, uhh.
Cause I'm servin' well-done ground beef.
Backed up by a glass of Sweet T.
And you know my theme song, uhh, that ding-a-long.
So just call me ball park cause I pump when you click your jaw.
And girl, I'm surprised you took it all.
Cause I run you like a track meet.
I can't wait, so jump in the back seat.
In y' caddy, or bikini.
So get ready, for the.
And you know the words, so sing along.
And prepare for the ding-ding-ding-along.
Th Girl, you know you's a winner!
Tell me what you want for dinner!
How 'bout a six-pack of that.
Ding-ding-dong, da-dat, da-dat.
Help us, help us, 68!
Who do you appreciate?
The one that's singin' you a sweet song.
Or the one that's feedin' you ding-dong?
Cause I can't sing too well.
But I can make that kitty-cat swell.
So before I push up.
Hold your breath and wish yourself good luck!
This ain't I Dream of Jeannie.
And I ain't got no teeny weenie.
Just call me King Kong:.
Leader of the pack when it comes to ding-dong!

Jay-Ski: 95 South, get on the mic now!!

A.B. and Daddy Black.
AB Ding-ding-dong-a-ding-ding-da-ding-dong!
Come on over for a game of ping-pong.
I'll serve, cause girl, I like ya.
Pass ya 'round and lemme spike ya.
So let a nigga get on ya.
Pretty baby, I'm gon-na.
Call ya up one night to ring-a-ling.
Put in your order for a 3-piece ding-a-ling.
DB Or an extra crispy Dom dinner.
I'm in her, yo fellas, I got a winner.
Cause I pack you with Dom till you fall asleep.
Call me Black, or Daddy Dog Sheep.
Hey yo, fellas, you gots to keep her.
Cause a nigga like Black'll creep her.
Hey yo, girl, you can't go wrong.
With this ding-ding-dong-a-ding-ding-da-dong-dong!

Jay-Ski: It's the Booty Man!!

Booty Man and The Rotweiler.
BM C'mon, c'mon, it's weenie-time.
95 South down with 69.
Ain't nuttin' but plumbers! You're gettin' weak.
Cause I'm deep in ya stomach.
And it ain't no shame.
Hey girl, let's go to the ball game.
If you're hungry, I'll feed ya.
I got a menu, so let me read ya:.
Hot smoked sausages and some salty peanuts.
And great, big ol' hot-dawgs that'll sho'nuff fill ya up, right.
But yo, don't try to eat too much.
Cause you know you might get choked -.
But you can't play around with a ding-a-long sandwich.
Cause it ain't no joke!
RW So when you come inside to fight tonight.
Be ready for the ding-a-ling.
And you can bring your glove if you want this love.
So step inside the ring.
I got left jabs and right jabs.
And I'ma hit you below the belt.
I talked to the surgeon general;.
He said ding-a-ling was good for your health! Uhh!
