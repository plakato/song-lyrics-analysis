Good Days Lyrics
by Quelle Chris.


What another fucking beautiful day.

Same old shit, what can I say?
My lady laughed, cuz my shit was an error type.
Plus I couldn't put down that goddamn get right.
Chasing money like greyhounds chase bunnies.
I'm always laughin', but it's probably cuz I feel funny.
Sometimes I think that I took the wrong mission.
Tryin' to create a stable life for a family that's long missin'.
But maybe Satan's tryin' to change my position.
And catch me flinchin', that's the oldest dish in the kitchen.
But what can a man save as a slave?
Celebrate a pen and grave like ? threw the rage.
And the cage, smoke rage and sip age on the sun raise, In LA where I stay.
It seems tomorrows gon' be the same.
What can a nigga say?, today was a good day.

I woke up to my pops coughing blood.
On top of that, I ain't sleep in about a month.
My routine Rembrandt on looped keys that's spooky.
Tryin' not to be the Mookie in my own movie.
Truthfully I'm like is that what I look foward to when you grow old?
Is that what my future hold? I pack another bowl.
Like there's kids in Africa who'd love to get high right now.
It's a high horse to ride that give time for me to write down.
Thinking too much like drinking through ulcers.
You tapping to the rhythm I'm fingering for the pulse.
But the fumes like it's dead.
The news bad weather, told Q we get through and make the blues more better.
We crack Denzel grins, let the pens spill, let it quell these.
Melanin tails spin that wheel until the brew is empty.
Jolly faces over water melancholy plates.
What can I say? I guess today was a good day.

Stay stressing like James off Good Times.
Mad like, like ?
In the 90's.

***SCRIBING.
