Accident waiting to happen - red star version Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

Billy BRAGG 
I've always been impressed with a girl. 
Who can sing for her supper and get breakfast as well 
That's. The way I am heaven help me 
He said ,'We, don't like peace, campaigners'round, here' 
As, he nailed another one to the wall, 
And! That'S what gets me in trouble? Heaven help me 
, 
Goodbye and good luck to all the rubbish that 
You've spoken 
Goodbye and good luck to all the promises. 
You'Ve broken 
Your life has lost its dignity, its beauty and its passion. 
You'Re an accident waiting to happen, 
 
There, you are standing at the bar 
And you're, giving me grief about the D-D-R 
And that chip on your shoulder gets bigger. As you 
Get older 
One of these nights, you're gon na get caught 
It'll. Give you a pregnant pause for thought: 
You're, a dedicated swallower of fascism, 
 
Time up and time out for all the liberties you've taken 
Time up and time out for all the friends that 
You've forsaken 
If you choose to waste away like death is back in fashion. 
You'Re, an accident waiting to happen, 
 
And, my sins are so unoriginal. 
I have all the self-loathing of a wolf in sheep's clothing 
In. This carnival of carnivores 
Heaven help me
