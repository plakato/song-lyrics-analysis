Addict Lyrics
by VI Seconds.


You ever been in love before?
I love the flow.
My high and I love the smoke, it's like.
You ever been in love before?
I love the flow.
My high and I love the smoke, it's like.
You ever been in love before?
I love the flow.
My high and I-.

She had the smile of an angel, but vices she had several.
Face of a goddess, body of a devil.
A way of being so she's someone I can trust.
Potential of pure love in combination with lust.
Blinded by her elegance and eloquence with words.
I went through a couple stages I never thought I would learn.
Hearts race, knees buckle, stutter words, see double.
Hoping when she looks at me she don't ever see trouble.
She's killing me, it's such a fatal attraction.
Gotta roam, she ain't coming my way cause I'm stacking.
A case of Is it too good to be true?
Well fuck it, I'm getting my fill while I got this with you.
I'm a glutton.
Thirsting and starving for your affection.
I'd happily be a guardian offering your protection.
No question, I'll go the farthest for your attention.
Armed with armor and weapons arm in arm with you, yes.
It's.

It's the reason that I deal with your bitching.
I'm with you 'till I'm laying in the street and I'm twitching.
I'm tripping, you brought a new feel to my system.
Just listen when I say I think I'm addicted.
To ya, to ya, to ya, to ya, to ya, to ya.
I ain't nothing but a druggie.
To ya, to ya, to ya.
Girl I'm in love with my high.

At war for you.
I willingly got drafted.
The battle is serious.
At times I think I won't last it.
Bodies of broken-hearted fellas scattered or hacked to bits.
As I'm roaming alone to your coraz√≥n in this labyrinth.
I hear it beating in the distance.
I also hear your exes laying beaten in the distance.
I'm bracing myself for what's coming soon.
I've already accepted I could leave this all with wounds.
It's worth it.
If there's rain then it's worth it.
If there's change then it's worth it.
If there's pain then it's worth it.
If one of our gears breaks I'll rearrange and rework it.
Give me a scene, play, stage, and I'll rehearse it.
I want this perfect, although perfection don't exist.
Until I'm making my exit I'll make this close as I can get.
People sending prayers and hopes cause I show signs of an addict.
Trying to keep up with this high it's like I'm holding a syringe.
It's.

It's the reason that I deal with your bitching.
I'm with you 'till I'm laying in the street and I'm twitching.
I'm tripping, you brought a new feel to my system.
Just listen when I say I think I'm addicted.
To ya, to ya, to ya, to ya, to ya, to ya.
I ain't nothing but a druggie.
To ya, to ya, to ya.
Girl I'm in love with my high.

Came in through the arm and flow throughout the veins.
Giving a feeling unheard of, as you approach the brain.
You came in through the smoke from an L.
And took me higher when I thought I was approaching Hell.
There are moments when I wanna call you a bitch.
But I chill and I bite my tongue cause I'm really craving my fix.
There are moments when I wanna put you down.
But my life won't be the same if I lack to have you around.
I'm an addict to your pleasures, I get lifted off your presence.
Some side effects come with pain but I refuse to learn my lesson.
I'm a fuck up with a problem with no problem with this shame.
Your love enters the vein but it's love all in the same it's.

Love.
