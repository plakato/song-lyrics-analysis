Baby It's Real Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

My love is real, my love is real.
This thing I feel, baby, it's real.
Something inside said I can't hide.
Baby, it's real, I know, I know it's real.

I work my fingers down to the bone.
And with these hands, I build you a home.
My love is strong, stronger than Rome.
Oh, baby, it's real, oh, yes, I know it's real.

My friends all say that I'm a fool.
But I can't stand my friend's ridicule.
Because it's real, oh, the way I feel.
Yes, baby, it's real.
I know, I know, I know, I know it's real.

Sure as the sun shine in the sky.
My love for you will never, never, never, never die.
And if you feel the way that I feel.
Baby, oh, it's real, I know, I know, I know it's real.

And if you feel, oh, oh, the way that I feel.
Baby it's real, oh, yes, it's real.
