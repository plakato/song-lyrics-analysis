â€‹dust hymn Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled. Head
Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled. Head

Water spills down, o'er
The glass left, always full
There's a dew under the bed, where
Sweat and dreams. Hath tread
Your feet would touch the floor
And drift around like boards
Hang. You, like a lullaby

Hang you like a lullaby
Hang. You like a lullaby

Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled. Head
Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled, head
Ohh ..., 

Little voices left to rot and plot
The crunching of your teeth
Might help. You sleep
It will not lift you
You, always wished you'd walk
Through and o'er the salt
Hangs. You like a lullaby

Hang. You like a lullaby
Hang. You like a lullaby
Ohh ... 

Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled. Head
Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled. Head
Oh..
Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled. Head
Ohh..
Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled. Head
Dear lie still along my old web
Cursed by your dust filled. Head
Dear lie still along. My old web
Cursed by your dust filled, head
