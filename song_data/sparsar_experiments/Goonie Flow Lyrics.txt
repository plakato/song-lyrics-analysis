Goonie Flow Lyrics
by Zuby.


I be in the studio, watching all these videos.
Budget like it's movie dough, all these rappers booty though!
Looking kind of fruity yo, MC call of duty bro.
Put away the Zuby flow, kill ‘em with the Goonie Flow!

Uh, yo!
Venomous cyclone faster to flip.
Eminent mic flow passion to spit.
Villainous psyche, compassion I skip.
Thriller like Michael, jacked and I'm fit.
And I'm quite sick no venereal iller.
Gotta write scripts like a serial thriller.
Better get rich like imperial scrilla.
Cuz I make hits like a serial killer.
Black on black with the fashion to flip.
I'ma make stacks with a passion to quip.
Gimme one take and I'm back with a script.
Leave me one break and I'm back with a hit.
Gimme one fake and I'm back with a stick.
With his dome on a spike and a sack with his hips.
And his back and his lips unattached from his wits.
Cuz he gassed he was sick so I smashed him to bits.
Now he's dashed in the six and I'm mashing the whip.
Doing one-sixty blasting The Clipse.
Thrashing the strip hit a patch with no grip.
Spun around three times and I crashed in a ditch.
Act and I split like a slash in a stitch.
Got a gash that'll last and a rash from the hit.
But I'm faster than Vick so I dashed to the sticks.
To a hatch in a patch where I crashed and I hid.
For 48 hours where the roaches are majority.
Hate hiding like a coward but my freedom is priority.
Said they found two bodies and I'm wanted by authorities.
A rapper and a DJ who was constantly ignoring me.

I be in the studio, watching all these videos.
Budget like it's movie dough, all these rappers booty though!
Looking kind of fruity yo, MC call of duty bro.
Put away the Zuby flow, kill ‘em with the Goonie Flow!
I be in the studio, watching all these videos.
Budget like it's movie dough, all these rappers booty though!
Looking kind of fruity yo, MC call of duty bro.
Put away the Zuby flow, kill ‘em with the Goonie Flow!

Uh!
Y'all got a mil in dough? I got a million flows.
Open a million doors and kill a million more.
Pussy is power in back of the brain.
Pushing the power and packing the pain.
Sinister shower to sadden the shame.
Sinning is sour and sapping the sane.
People like “Zuby you're rapping insane!”.
Angry like y'all took a crap in my lane.
Ripping up flowers and smashing the pane.
And I'm killing you cowards and capping the lame.
Flow like I'm boating and I'm openly gloating.
I'm openly scoping and hope I'm provoking.
You hope that I'm joking, I poke and you're soaking.
I'm choking your throat like the smoking you're toking.
I'm dope and you're broken my flow got.
you open.
Industry terrible, rappers are hopeless.
Focus and notice I float like a lotus.
Above the mainstream while you ford like a Focus.
You rappers are jokers, beat is complete but the rapping is bogus.
Talk all you want about me but I'm killing it.
Want to not move to this beat but you're feeling it.
I'll get ahead of this heat till I'm winning it.
Stacking up bread overhead that's con-ceiling it.
Wake up the dead with a track they so riveted.
I make a bed for a beat and I chill in it.
Skill is definitive never derivative.
Thinking ahead you'll rewind it unlimited  catch up.

Are you down Zuby?
