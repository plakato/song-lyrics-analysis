Rap God Lyrics
by Zoetic.


G-O-A-T, G-O-A-T.
Greatest of all time the G-O-A-T.

Im startin to feel like I'm a rap god, rap god.
If you don't agree then you a retard, retard.
All of these local backpacking rappers claim that they go hard.
Grown up in the suburbs, not the gutter man y'all are all frauds.
Im feelin grimy, don't try to find me, got the devil behind me.
Kinda slimy, spittin poison ivy until I'm ninety.
If i don't kill myself by then, one day ill wake up dead.
Everyone will continue but hip hop will come at its very end.
I'm the best that ever come, you all just swallow cum!
Spittin ether, like a creature, wit demonic features, com in thru yo speakers.
Got em running out of they're sneakers, every time i give em a feature, I'm.
the student you just sitting in the bleachers.
Imma graduate in my cap and gown, i deserve a crown, thrown up my tassel cause my parents proud inside the crowd.
Everything that goes up must go down, bet you tryna figure out who i sound.
like now!
But fuck that I'm my own breed, cut from a different cloth.
I'm hot as broth, all you dumb thots are obsessed wit sloths.
You're the fiends i serve you, observe you, until I'm on your nerves you.

Try to chop it up wit me but fuck it i just swerve you!
Murder you dweebs, choke you wit ya anal beads, i.
Ain't wit that shit, see my life got different needs, pause.
Big boss pit, and a bad ass bitch.
Homie i move at a different speed.
You can't see me but still believe.
Im an unknown diety, directly destroying detainees.
Mothafucka I'm fly as Elliot's bike, but instead of E.T i got a midget dyke.
Inside of the basket, now i sound like i'm trip pin on acid, pass it.
Boutta blow another gasket, smash it.
Putting bodies in they caskets. thats it.
Flash it, shoot the ratchet leave you face down in the lake like you was.
bobbin for apples action.
You shitheads spewing stupidity, you saying I'm gimmicky?
Mothafuck you similes!
I masturbate on all you metaphors, and annihilate alliteration.
Stop that rhetorical repetition so theres no topic I'm missin listen.
Know what I'm sizzlin I'm thizzlin.
Just bailed out of the prison, double-fistin two bitches not missin.
Cause you hat in dick riders got me on a musical mission.
Like hey mothafucka, if you pray mothafucka.
You just might be able to live another day mothafucka.
I, spray mothafucka, its a shame mothafucka.
Never delaying or swayin I'm catching prey mothafucka.
Ok mothafucka, thats all i should say mothafucka.
Cause the haters will say that its cliche mothafucka.
But they some cray mothafuckas, some in the way mothafuckas.
So ill stop when the beat goes down to lay mothafucka I!
Touch more keys than a janitor, you a scavenger.
Check my statistics, I'm ballistic, yes i will damage ya!
Amateurs, all y'all! this is the final call.
Stand up tall, grow some balls, and get up off the wall!
You wanna challenge me but can't beat me like gravity!
Leave you with cavities, followed by the agony!
While I'm clutching ya heart, and there's a darkness where it used to be!
I tear limbs apart, i don't know whether to stop or start.
But i know one things for sure that i'll still be climbing up to the charts,.
AHHH!
Zoetic's at ya home, with cannons and catapults.
We com in for all adults, we jolt em with the revolt, bolt.
So much unity that you would think we were in a cult, no vote.
Look at me now, feet off the ground.
Jumpin in my flow you probably will drown.
Like swimming in the nile, or a mountainous pile of cash.
Sinkin yo ass, homie that paper goes down for miles.
But the cops took it all away and stuffed it in they're files.
But i smile, cause I'm finna take my case to trial.
Line em up in single file, you could say i have a hot style!
I'm alive, when the beat drops and arrives.
I could feel the darkness rise, what a wonderful surprise.
You will soon meet yo demise, make yo mom break down and cry.
You all try to throw yo five, every time i break it down.
But you cannot match my style, I'm the one that wears the crown!
Not Diddy or Yeezus, they both got no penis.
I'm the genius, givin shock to rap my lyricism's grievous, Jesus!
I mean Jessica, but theres another girl right next to her.
But not stressing brush, mothafucka i just had sex wit her!
Its not even funny how i be getting this dough.
Whipping work on the tour until my bank account grows.
Swagger out from head to toe, my cloth so fresh.
Lookin for a yellowbone in a nice tight dress.
So i could rip it off her chest, and reward her wit sex.
And then I'm right out the door, after i come i just go.
I ain't wit that cuddling shit ho, this ain't Drake, oh no no.
You say theres no new friends, but who do you spend?
All ya time wit, bitch, do females not count then?
Ok ill stop takin shots, when you give me a chaser.
Take this pencil I'm writin wit, turn it around and erase ya.
So go catch some vapors, I'm a beast in the nature and.
Naturally, i separate the strong from the weak.
Startin riots in the streets, to the rhythm of the beat.
My circle small i only fuck wit the elite.
Everybody else, will, feel the hand of defeat.
Im talking bout the Meeks, Drizzy Drake and Chief Keef.
J. Cole, Mac Miller, French Montana, Pusha T, cause.
Honestly, all these rappers sound like shit to me.
They may be hot now, but in a few years they'll be history.
A dusty prop on the top shelf, yo hands dealt.
I don't need no one's help i do it myself.
For all i know you're probably not listening right now.
But thats no legitimate excuse for me to switch it up wit the style.
If i try to rap fast for a while, will you promise to keep it a thou.
Instead of switching ya vocals all you cheatin mothafuckas does that make you.
proud?
A hundred and ten words in ten seconds? are you fuckin nuts?!
If i was to chop it up all of you competition would probably be my lunch.
Well i guess thats its crunch time, i don't need referees with these.
punchlines.
Cause i spit automatically, haters be aggy see me.
But don't challenge me, losin they're balance in battles.
They're baffled, how i put bars together like a game of some scrabble.
I cackle like jackals and changing the channel.
If you want to dabble, try to do it don't babble, its too much to tackle.
Just hop on y saddle and come to my castle, i came here to paddle.
In holy water, you thirsty mothafuckas i was born in a chapel, assholes.
Yes i know my style's a bit odd, all the rest are just facades.
The audience applauds, cause they just witnessed the rap god.
