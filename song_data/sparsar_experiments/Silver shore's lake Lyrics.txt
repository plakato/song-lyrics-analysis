Silver shore's lake Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.

Capricorn here we stand at silver, shore's, lake
It's, shining, black and gold
With some stones in our hands and our feet in the sand
Forever growing old
And. Our reflection looks strange. Looking back to us
Our eyes, they open wide
And. We can see the tides, so we say: goodbye
And watch the waters. Rise
I wish my heart was deep, enough
So deep that I could keep you love
So deep that I could keep it off
I wish my heart, ... 
Silent path, silent lake, we see every wave
Our eyes are black and gold
We push our palms to the stars. Everyone is ours
We, do not fear the cold
And. Our reflection looks strange. Looking back to us
Our arms, they open wide
We drop our hands to our sides as the waters rise
And take us from inside
I wish. My heart was deep enough
So deep that I could keep you love
So deep, that I could keep it off
I wish my heart, ... 
Be, careful cousin, be careful blood
If, the cold doesn't get you then the other thing, does
Be careful brother, be careful. Love
Be, careful father be careful. Son
Or you'll never find another one
Be careful father be careful. Son
