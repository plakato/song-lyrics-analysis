Nausea Lyrics
by X.


Today you're gonna be so sick, so sick.
You'll prop your forehead on the sink.
Say, Oh Christ, oh Jesus Christ.
My head's gonna crack like a bank.

Tonight you'll fall asleep in clothes.
So late like a candy bar wrapped up.
For lunch that's all you get to taste.
Poverty and spit.
Poverty and spit.

Nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to sleep.

Today you're gonna be so sick, so sick.
You'll prop your forehead on the sink.
Say, Oh Christ, oh Jesus Christ.
My head's gonna crack like a bank.

Tonight you'll fall asleep in clothes.
So late like a candy bar wrapped up.
For lunch that's all you get to taste.
Poverty and spit.
Spit and spit.

Nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to sleep.

You're talking out of harmony.
You can't remember what you said.
Cut it out, you feel retarded.
Take the scissors, saw the head.

Talking out of harmony.
Can't remember what you said.
Cut it out, you feel retarded.
Take the scissors, saw the head.

Nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to nausea.
Bloody red eyes go to sleep.
