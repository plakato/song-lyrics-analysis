L.A. Fresh Lyrics
by Visionaries.

Yes, yes 3x.

Yes, Yes.
Los Angeles fresh, Los Angeles fresh.
Yes, Yes, Yes.
Los Angeles fresh, Los Angeles fresh, Los Angeles fresh.

Bright lights.
Bust stops.
Like cops.
Pop locks.
Chain linked fence henceforth.
Talent is received.
All sorts of goals achieved.
Reach souls.
Tore down divisions like Berlin straight as poles.
Waving flags you're in tune.
With maroon moon.
As time flies friendly skies.
Visionaries take the red out your eyes.
Suit the flies with this application.
Loving is my occupation.
Recycle hesitation.
Back and forth pacing.
Speak or basing.
Humans racing.
Loving when they're hating.

Take it evil feeling backwards to live.
Every time I bust I got something to give.
An individual who remains invisible.
Indivisible.
My habitual ritual.
Is to uplift all those who are willing.
Living in a city where the devil makes a killing.
Dealing lost angles.
Material things.
Plus I gotcha to hot.
Burnt off the wings.
Mic dreams to pipe dreams.
Villages of right teams.
Were enlightening with what we say.
K.O.O.L will make you l.o.o.k.
In a different type of way for L.A., C.A.

2mex.
I am an Indian alien.
Alien Indian.
Mexican medicine, messages of oxygen.
I Support the EZLN.
Be one without and you will live easier.
That's easier man.
Love the one your with.

External beauty is just a temporary myth.
Some things always trying take away your gift.
Never walk away wondering if.
Life was fake.
My sister is great.
They call me Mr. Mistake.
I kissed this girl on a date.
I couldn't wait.
She was like chill.
It wasn't gods will.
Of Mexican descent I am still.
