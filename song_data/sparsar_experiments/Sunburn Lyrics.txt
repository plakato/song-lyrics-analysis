Sunburn Lyrics
by ZOOpfish.


I don't want the pain to go away.
Cause then all the memories will fade.
I don't want the pain to go away.

I promise you this ain't a love song.
More so, me and you should maybe meet up get some lunch soon.
Ooowee you look good with that dress on.
Been eating lots of salad and cutting back on the dressin'.
I been drinking, thinking me and you should make a mission.
To find a pretty sofa to hopefully make a mess on.
Or maybe make a planet and plan it to raise our kids on.
This clouds a spaceship, face it girl get on.
Listen.
Learn your lesson.
They say they like your dress but they'd prefer if you had less on.
I think you understand it, demanding all this attention.
In general you wanna talk, well I'm standing at attention.

I don't want the pain to go away.

Cause then all the memories will fade.

I don't want the pain to go away.

She's like a sunburn in late June.
Reminiscing bout them days in grade school.
You know when I promise I'll be there soon.
Late night we cuddle up, together gazing at the moon.
Shooting star, make a wish, undercover wish for doom.
I guarantee no one better than me.
Kind of bitter but that's the product you left me to freeze.
Pretty common, the same story that turn a dude to a player.
Wondering why, internally repressing anger.
Well I'm reasonably good looking.
All because you a dime, no reason to stay stuck in.
Yup, I see you fish, it's okay to reminisce.
Time to time, everything can't always be what it seems, preach.

I don't want the pain to go away.

Cause then all the memories will fade.

I don't want the pain to go away.

Ooo girl, you can put me though pain.
Your the ying to my yang.
Your the sun to my rain.
I think cupid got me stupid, he controlling my brain.
And your cute little smile got me going insane.
I'll just duck her, really it's fine, it's just a thing.
The Buckner of feelings flipped time and got him a ring.
Now I'm shripping, sipping something and I'm higher than Ming.
Rocket tripping, ship is something but it's still to be seen.
Ever got a problem to settle, um hey, I'm here.
We can run away together someday, somewhere.
Say you'll only lie a little and you'll always tell the truth.
There's only nine things that I hate about you.

I don't want the pain to go away.

Cause then all the memories will fade.

I don't want the pain to go away.

She's like a.
She's like a.
She's like a.
She's like a.
She's like a Sunburn.
She's like a Sunburn.
She's like a Sunburn.
She's like a Sunburn.
She's like a Sunburn.
She's like a Sunburn.
She's like a Sunburn.
She's like a Sunburn.
