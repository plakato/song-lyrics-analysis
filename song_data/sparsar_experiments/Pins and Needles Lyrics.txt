Pins and Needles Lyrics
by Sworn In.


I can't think straight: 
So, don't wait up for me, 
I think I'll, probably be late. 
I'Ll just count to three 
 
1: 2 3 / Go 
 
I, couldn't care less 
Past the point of distress, 
With a mind full of stress and a body to undress 
Nothing else. Matters 
Cause nothing's real in this mess, 
 
Versus 3 
I digress. 
I want to caress your skin 
So I'll, give it my blessing, darling, 
I've learned a lot from my stay in hell, 
I've learned, I don't have a story to tell 
Because when things become too much. 
When love turns to touch 
Self-destruction. Is my crutch, 
 
Give me pins and needles? I'M tearing myself apart. 
Give me pins and needles 
I'm playing my part 
And. This pain is only the start. 
 
Versus, 4 
I promise 
I am romantic. 
I swear 
But. I don't have to be fair. 
It'S one sided. This time 
So I walk this line. 
Between safety and sanity 
Who am, I meant, to be .
 
Pre-Versus 5 
Still wishing I was dead, 
, 
Versus, 5 
So I'll poison, myself 
Too much beauty. I suppose 
These stories in my head are all I can compose 
But. As my skin turns pale, 
My eyes, just stay shut, 
Filled them with pins and needles, all for what 
Filled them with pins and needles. All for what
