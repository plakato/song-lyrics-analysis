Invisible Lyrics
by The Zolas.

I want to be invisible. 
And lurk around the world for good 
Sleeping CEO's 
I'll creep into your gated hoods 
Whisper whisper in your dreams. 
And tell you how to right your wrongs. 
And. If I come three nights 
Next morning, you'll be sleeping long 
 
Can't face the flood by ourselves. 
We will join with the weather, 
 
When the nighttime crashes in 
Look around beside you, babe 
We're, your friends 
When. You need some oxygen 
Jump into the fire with us. 
 
When 8 figures, sleep, 
There ain't, nobody left to haunt 
The kids are smoking in the street 
Hot and heavy talk of fonts 
 
Can't face the flood by ourselves. 
We will join with the weather, 
 
When the nighttime crashes in 
Look around beside you, babe 
We're. Your friends 
When, you need some oxygen 
Jump into the fire with us: 
 
When, the nighttime crashes in 
Look around beside you, babe 
We're, your friends, 
When you're, feeling powerless 
Jump into the fire with us
