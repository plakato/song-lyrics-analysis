Burden In Your Hands Lyrics
by Underoath.

Confusing and scared.
There is a decision made with this choice.
A child has to pay.
She puts it's life in her hands.
And then she destroys it's only chance to become someone in life.
You should of thought about the baby before you had sex.
Because you have destroyed a gift from God.
You kill.
You destroyed.
Never will this baby be able to grow up or show it's love.
You'll never hear it say I love you, I love you.
God does not give you the privilege to carry a child for nothing.
When you kill.
You destroy that child's dreams and hopes.
How innocent a baby is... how can you put it to death?
What if you were aborted....
You could've never had life.
And now you make a choice to take this child's life.
Because it is a burden in your hands.
A burden in your hands.
Destroyed out of convenience.
They put an end to your life.
Because you're too big a burden.
And one that they can not have.
So they take your life before your first breath.
When will it stop? The killings continue.
Babies die every day because of a pro choice made.
Helpless and innocent they are put to death.
Then why did the parents choose to plant a seed and then destroy it?
Pray for the people who are killing the kids of tomorrow.
How desperately they need Jesus Christ in their hearts.
So they take your life.
Because your a burden in their hands.
Destroyed our of convenience.
They put a end to you life.
Because you're too big a burden and one that they can not have.
So they take your life before your first breath.
So they take your life before your first breath.
