Around Again Lyrics
by The Union.

Cold and walking on their heads, washing hands in tears they shed.
As a child is born to a brand new day, wars are lost and won.
As the city sleeps, the dirty deeds are laid.
And every time that you think, you're right, you're wrong.
Now it won't be long, 'til the voice of truth has had it's say.
Now it won't be long, 'til everything that's owed is all repaid.
Losing faith in honesty, bathing in our sympathy.
Well the child is torn to another way, he's speaking with a gun.
Now the city weeps, the dirty deeds were played.
And every time that he thinks, he's right, he's wrong.
Now it won't be long, 'til the voice of truth has had it's say.
And it won't be long, 'til everything that's owed is all repaid.
Yeah, it won't be long, 'til karma comes around again.
Around again my friend.
As the raven screams, you'll never see the dawn.
You look around and everything you've had is gone.
