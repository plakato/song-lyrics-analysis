Start All Over Lyrics
by Zuby.


Starting blocks as opposed to hitting the finish line.
Brutus versus Popeye underdog and its spinach time.
The ways of the world leave me down in the dumps.
But I reconstruct my beginning its bigger than blowing up.

Like a convict, serving 20 odd at large.
Finally set free in society its gotta be hard.
Your baby moms moved on, got another brother raising your kid.
Starting fresh coming home from a bid I guess....

Like the cheating boyfriend or the backstabbing lady.
Forgiven by your counterpart broken heart for your baby boo.
Guess you starting over too cuz if its true.
Your new beginnings spinning them gray skies into blue so.
Choose, lose, win, begin.
We gon start it over again so all in sing it.

Work so hard.
But I'm only human.
All, over, again.
Start all over again, again.

But I rap and I'm in Oxford, wait that ain't that typical.
I'm tryin to make an earning so I gotta get my pence right.
Cuz can't make a buck unless you start with some sense/cents right?

The worlds a messed up place and nowadays you pick your fate.
I'm old enough to go to war but couldn't drink in the States.
If you think about it really yo what sense does that make?
Answer's clear no shots or beer but can take shots to the face.

Yo I rhyme what I feel never selling out for dough.
This a kinda thoughtful song thats how Im feeling at the mo.
Kinda stressed, not depressed, trying to get Soundscan to this.
What more do you want yo? I'm young hot and talented.
So love me love me love me.
And I do it cuz I want to, chyeeea!

Its a sick world we live in these days.
Cause we can blow each other up but we can't cure AIDS.
We dont help each other out, we just try to get paid.
And forget about love, we just try to get laid, yup.

Webbafied.
I was jumping the gun in the hundred bar dash.
False start, out of the gate I was on blast.
Dirty laundry hang on my clothesline perhaps.
Since its 2006 I should be cleaning up my act.
Fresh start!

Zuby.
Some deny that they feel it still I got their respect.
No rap vet no teks still its selling like sex.
If I go youre gonna miss me like the dearly departed.
3-6-0 rotation, damn look Im back where I started.

) And.
we do it--cuz--we--want--to.
