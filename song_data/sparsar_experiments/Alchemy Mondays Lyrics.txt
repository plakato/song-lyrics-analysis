Alchemy Mondays Lyrics
by Voltaire.

Monday, time for Alchemy.
I'm buried behind the gallery.
Come in and see a band.
From Norway or Japan.
Pick up the CD while you're able.
Some are on a tiny German label.

Miss Gothic NYC.
Hey, save a dance for me.
And do deposit if you please.
Some black lipstick on my peepee.

Monday time for alchemy.
So come in and have a pint.
There's a hideous man named Mike.
And a bunch of gothic tykes.
And George at the bar with his fake fangs on.
And hold everything, they're playing my song.
It gets so lonely being evil.

It's Monday night again.
So pull up a chair my friend.
And Jason and Althea.
Will be oh so glad to see ya.
Don't get cake on your velvet cape.
Here at Alchemy Mondays.
