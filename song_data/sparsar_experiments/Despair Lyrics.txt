Despair Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

Scrape... harder.
Aftermath sets in on me.
I am wretched, detestable, worthless.

Compelled to comprehend the guilt.
To forfeit everything for atonement.

I'll hide away to fight the side that's screaming, What have you done?
And the other that's fine with being, The bloodstained one.
Myself against me, two darkened faces, which one will win.

Take this affliction of the heart.
Dull these wounds of sorrow.
Beg for attrition from remorse.
My soul become so hollow.

I crawled and grasped for it, but still, grace eludes me.

I could have been the one to save us all.
From forces raging.
Instead I chose to fade and lost control.
And now I'm paying.

This agony is punishment for the choice I made.
I've never felt so crushed beneath an overwhelming weight.
Destroyed by misery, this aching disease, torment deserved.

Turn my hands to stone.
God knows my heart's halfway there.
Just take away my ability to kill.
Alter my moral perception.
Turn it upside down.

I found a place to escape from two sides of sin.
Shed simulation to become two beasts within.
I'll take the pain and build four walls fortress of shame.
Lock me away for a just cause bloody dichotomy.
I can't erase the consequence of murderous rage.
I'll simply take myself away from this ravaged place.
