Contraband Lyrics
by VI Seconds.


For the next four minutes.
We're gonna do some roleplay.
I'm gonna be a drug lord.
Here's my story.

Contraband, Contraband.
I'm counting' bands from sellin' this contraband.
I'm wearing foreign shit, I'm walkin' contraband.
They want a Nigga gone, for all this contraband.

And I'm kickin' something foreign, wait.
Foreign weight, crack, fuck your debate.
El Chapo, with a hot flow, hostile.
Greedy children from the way I hoard the cake.

See the way I came back on my shit.
Feens knockin' from the moment that I package the shit.
White girl for their noses.
The sweet smell of Miley you know this.

I can build a crib with the bricks I'm movin' within' the street.
Not a worry bout' a thing police aren't gettin' me.
I'm calling the shots, slick and calm as a fox.
You fuckin' with the money? Then I'm palmin' a Glock.

I'm armed and I pop, but if I don't really wanna'.
I'm sending out my Lil' Niggas to bring you the drama.
Never learned to give a fuck more.
This is day by the day in the life of a drug lord.

Contraband, Contraband.
I'm counting' bands from sellin' this contraband.
I'm wearing foreign shit, I'm walkin' contraband.
They want a Nigga gone, for all this contraband.

Years later, demand in my sections.
Insane, Niggas know this man is a legend.
Caught a couple bodies off of Niggas rob me.
If anybody saw there's no recollection.

Hush, you don't want me to let this.
Bust, it's known that I'm wreckless.
Just know if ya man didn't make it.
Trust, no retaliations.

Till the day that a couple of haters.
Tried to claim my life cause I'm getting my paper.
They came up the palace guns a blastin'.
The balls! I was shocked like the effects a taser.

Niggas on the roof takin' aim with a laser.
Shootin to kill thoughts of death don't phase em'.
Guarding the income, offin' these fuck boys.
Shit you gotta deal with, living as a drug lord.

Contraband, Contraband.
I'm counting' bands from sellin' this contraband.
I'm wearing foreign shit, I'm walkin' contraband.
They want a Nigga gone, for all this contraband.

Here I relax amongst the bodies.
Don't give enough of a fuck for sorries.
I lost some soldiers but I'll buy some more.
Cause ain't nobody satisfied with being poor.

I got coke all in my mansion.
Coke all in my mansion.
I got coke all in my mansion.
Coke all in my.. Wait hold up.

Now I wonder how these Niggas knew just where to show up.
An inside job makes all the sense.
Cause everything that's happenings an easy blow up.
Let me slow up, Cause I can't think when tense.

Let's check, almost got robbed a while back.
And they knew my layout which means a rat.
Is amongst my soldiers, within my pack.
And if it's fucking with profit I ain't fucking with that.

Contraband, Contraband.
I'm counting' bands from sellin' this contraband.
I'm wearing foreign shit, I'm walkin' contraband.
They want a Nigga gone, for all this contraband.

Ten hut, I wanna hear no noises.
Cause' one of y'all amongst us is bringing us poison.
So spill, I wanna know just who got the issue.
Cause I got a .45 that'll be happy to split you.

So which one of you has to need to.
Plot and bit the same hand that feeds you.
I noticed a gone face that wasn't deceased.
And it hit me, the face of the one released.

The the phone rang... So it's you Ricardo?
You know what I do, why be retardo?
I fed and paid you, you had no needs.
But I guess it happens when Niggas got greed.

Heh, my Nigga, you're funny.
You took my brother, I'm taking your money.
Don't chase, cause' problems are what you're beholding.
The cops are gon' be there in only a moment.

Contraband, Contraband.
I'm counting' bands from sellin' this contraband.
I'm wearing foreign shit, I'm walkin' contraband.
They want a Nigga gone, for all this contraband.

Everything that I've worked for.
Whipping in the kitchen from a sophmore.
Gettin' taken away at the end of this day.
Cause' a snake Nigga chose to act softcore.

Whoop Whoop and so it starts.
All because of a bonapart.
Someone I took in with generous eyes.
Coming in only to plan my demise.

Heh, that's how the story goes.
When paper cometh some homies go.
I got to be a god in this era.
But trustin' a peasant? The largest of errors.

Fuck it, I built this empire.
And ima' stand by until I expire.
And so I approach as cops shoot at my gang.
So if I gotta go ima' go with a bang.

Contraband, Contraband.
I'm counting' bands from sellin' this contraband.
I'm wearing foreign shit, I'm walkin' contraband.
They want a Nigga gone, for all this contraband.

And here I lay.
In a fucking pool of blood.
That's what I get for trustin a Nigga huh?
Fuck it.
