I Killed Midnight Lyrics
by Sworn In.

I slit my throat.
The last time I spoke.
Was a thanks for everything.
Not a hope you choke.
Nights in confinement.
I know them well.
So you can tell the gang.
I'll see them in hell.
You think I give a fuck about your life?
Take my advice and fall onto a knife.
