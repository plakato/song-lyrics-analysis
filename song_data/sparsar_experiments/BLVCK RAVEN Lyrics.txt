BLVCK RAVEN Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


In the south, what you bout', what you bout'.
My nigga's out in that drought.
Workin' in that drought.
We can't hear what they saying, who talkin'?
Nigga this that Black Raven, Black Raven.

Hopped on it like it's me, hopped on it she miss me.
Young nigga be crispy, that all black don't miss me.
B-R-to the-K, woke up like, where the cake?
Friendly nigga's you know I hate, keep to myself, must elevate.
Eat it up, pass another plate.
Tell Zimmerman he's never safe.
Make moves, I draw the plays.
Didn't give a fuck since yesterday.
Posted up sitting in the shade, she treat me like I got it made.
Hometown, I'm made in Dade.
It's Raider Klan so we gon' Raid.

And a nigga came through with that 4-0, blowin' on that indo'.
In the drought running routes through, Kendo.

Cause I'm bout' mine from the south side.
Raider ship leave nigga's capsized.
In all black when that MAC slide, nigga's talking loud and get capitalized.

Hearing none of that fuck shit, nigga we the Young Money no Trukfit.
We be getting shit crunk, bringin' the phonk.
If he get out of line then get left in the trunk nigga.
Black Land be that Black Klan that run down on nigga's thats actin'.
Packin' on that MAC-10 that be sparkin' the scene when in action.
