BLVCK RAVEN Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


In, the south, what you bout', what you bout', 
My nigga's out in that drought, 
Workin' in that drought, 
We can't hear what they saying, who talkin' 
Nigga this: that Black Raven Black Raven 
 
Hopped on it like it's me, hopped on it. She miss me 
Young nigga be crispy that all black don't miss me. 
B-R-To the-K woke up like where the cake 
Friendly nigga's, you know I hate keep to myself - must elevate 
Eat it up pass another plate. 
Tell Zimmerman he's, never safe 
Make moves. I draw the plays 
Didn't, give a fuck since yesterday 
Posted up sitting in the shade she treat me like. I got it made 
Hometown I'm made in Dade 
It's Raider Klan, so we gon' Raid 
 
And, a nigga came through with that 4-0 blowin' on that indo' 
In, the drought running routes through Kendo 

Cause, I'm bout' mine from the south side. 
Raider ship leave nigga's capsized 
In all black when that MAC slide nigga's talking loud and get capitalized
 
Hearing. None of that fuck shit nigga. We, the Young Money, no Trukfit 
We, be getting shit. Crunk bringin' the phonk 
If he get out of line then get left in the trunk. Nigga 
Black Land be that Black Klan that run down on nigga's thats actin' 
Packin' on that MAC-10 that be sparkin' the scene when in action,
