Spaceship Lyrics
by Unda Preshur.


You're an alien you're out of this world.
We could sit on the moon watching earth spin and then twirl.
Tonight i'm feeling i'm wasted, we can make it.
So baby why don't you take a ride on my spaceship.
Or any way you can take it.

You got me up, i can't get down.
You got me f*** ed, i'm on ex now.
You got me stuck, i'm all kept round.
You moving on, to the next now.
Youre playing me, and you push me.
Tell me i'm yours, and could we.
Be a would be? you can be mine cause.
I'm feeling we could make a good look see.

I want to take you home, and make you moan.
Cause thinking of you got me saying girl you fine and sexy.
I want to take you to mars, i want to xplore all the stars.
I want you grinding up against me.

You're an alien you're out of this world.
We could sit on the moon watching earth spin and then twirl.
Tonight i'm feeling i'm wasted, we can make it.
So baby why don't you take a ride on my spaceship.
Or any way you can take it.

Anyway you can take it.
Anyway you can take it.
Anyway you can take it.
Take a ride on my space ship.

Explore a planet, if you let me.
Cause gravity it don't affect me.
I need yah right now yah sexy.
Bet we could lastforever so undress me.

I got you moaning that, give me one hit of your.
Love now i'm overdosing can't.
Seem to contain my lust for you, blame my love for you.
Your ex, that dude ain't enough for you.

I'll treat you better, from the look on your face.
I can read all you need is preshur.
I can see you deeply need me, to lead your dreams free.
So we could be forever.

Youre out of this world, your love got me high.
From a hit of it, and I can fly.
Don't be pissed at them, they can't resist the chick.
They all jello cause you different, you're infinite.

You're an alien you're out of this world.
We could sit on the moon watching earth spin and then twirl.
Tonight i'm feeling i'm wasted, we can make it.
So baby why don't you take a ride on my spaceship.
Or any way you can take it.

Anyway you can take it.
Anyway you can take it.
Anyway you can take it.
Take a ride on my space ship.

I want to take you home, and make you moan.
Cause thinking of you got me saying girl you fine and sexy.
I want to take you to mars, i want to xplore all the stars.
I want you grinding up against me.
