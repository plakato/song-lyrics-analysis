The Hood Luv Me Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


Yeah know I'm tal'n bout, Yung Redd mayn.
Swishahouse the click, E-Class what they tal'n bout.
Know I'm saying, TF nigga ay.

Yung Redd.
Spending money, that I ain't never had.
In my hood I'm a star, with mo' stripes than your flag.
If my watch sick, then my L ring's throwing up.
Sideline niggas, still talking I'm showing up.
I hear em speaking, on a block they ain't seen.
Paint job soaking wet, bet my jewelry can't me.
All my hoes look like, they came off the screen.
With a ass so fat, hair down to her knees.
Got my H on my hat, shades match that.
Drank I'm po'ing up, haze I'm burning that.
I pop tags, I'm the one your gal talk about.
My ring insane, look his chain Crayola box.
Play the parking lot, do's up the Promenade.
Trunk cracked like the sidewalk, you know what I'm bout.
These out of town niggas, thinking we slow.
But my bread come fast, and getting all mine back.

I got my ape's laced up, now I'm running my block.
Pockets busting at the seam, till them rubber bands pop.
Mayn I been showing up, that's why them girls love me.
You ain't gotta like me, but the hood love me.
She ain't never met, a nigga this hood.
Tell her we don't look good, then you don't look good.
I ain't never faking, that's why them girls love me.
Post up, way I'm feeling mean the hood love me.

E-Class.
I'm a hood cat, that got millionaire tendencies.
Hit the scene, D's on a limousine lit with screens.
Paint job, same color as promethazyne.
Diamonds in my piece, liquid green like some Listerine.
The blue bell wrist, the Dairy Queen pinky ring.
All you can ice bitch, I'm some'ing like a skating ring.
I told Johnny, I want it long as he make it bling.
Bright so when it's light, as a light hit it and make a scene.
The hoes wet, cause they liking the way I make it seem.
Easy to get gutter and butter, working a triple beam.
My 16's, are carosine and gasoline.
Margaritas next to electric heaters, releasing steam.
I'm dedicated, and deep in love with this music thing.
I ain't leaving no time soon, you should get use to me.
I got a on-going problem, I don't know who to see.
That'll help me handle my feddy, and getting cream.

Willie D.
Cat niggas, bow down to the realest.
I ain't jumping on a track, if the hood can't feel it.
Relentless is the label, but I fuck with Swishahouse.
Run up on me partna, bet you I ain't gon miss your mouth.
Lexus Cadillacs, alligators and shrimps.
Texas is the home, of the players and pimps.
Respect that, cause if you come around here plexing.
You going back home, in the cargo section.
Stay on my grind, I ain't the sorry type.
Not what you had in mind, but I'm what your daughter like.
You want her with a cake, but she desire a strong nigga.
That's why everytime I see the bitch, I'ma long dick her.
Niggas eating, cause a Northside playa took a gamble.
Nelly made the song, but I started country grammar.
They focused on my city right now, cause we blowing up.
It's Willie motherfucking D, I been showing up.
