If You Want a Burger... Lyrics
by Yung Poppy.


Okay, so let me get two double cheeseburgers, two, uh, small fries.
And two waters cause we broke as fuck, I'm just sayin'.

Bitch, stop acting skinny, what the--.

If you want a burger, eat a burger.
Bitch, if you want a french fry, eat a french fry.
Bitch, if you want a burger, eat a burger.
Bitch, if you want a french fry, eat a french fry.
Dafuq? Like.

I said Kiesha Red, I said Kiesha Red.
I had a burger and a french fry, yeah, today.
This bitch acting brand new like.
She don't want no muhfuckin' burger or a french fry.
Bitch, you knew - look.
I'mma make you eat one today like ayyy!
Bitch, just take a little bite.
Acting like he big, look, acting like he big when.
In reality, ho, you a skinny bitch, aye!
Hah, is you mad or nah?
Cause you ain't eating right and, bitch, you thought.
So get it together, we in this together.
We'll eat this together, bitch.
You is my bitch, you know you my bitch.
I go out with my bitch, that's to the club with my bitch.
I knock niggas out with my bitch, buy tampons with my bitch.
Now I'm tryna eat a burger and a french fry with my bitch.
Dafuq? Like.

Need another one.

I need some ketchup.

I need some secret sauce.

Oh, this ain't Jack the Box?

Break.
This go out to all of them bitches.
Skinny, lightweight, be trippin'.
'Bout eating a burger.
Come on, bitch, and get with it.

Eat another one, well, what you want then?
Bitch, a salad? Dafuq bitch?
That shit don't fill you up, like what bitch?
I take a burger and a french fry to the cut, bitch.
I fuck it up, I fuck it up, I fuck it up, bitch.
Now fuck it up, now fuck it up, now fuck it up, bitch.
I fuck it up, I fuck it up, I fuck it up, bitch.
Now fuck it up, now fuck it up, now fuck it up, bitch.

Break.
