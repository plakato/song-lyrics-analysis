I Can Tell Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


You ain't got ta, say too much 
From the look in your eyes, 
I can tell you want to fuck 
 
And. You ain't got ta. Call me ya: boo 
Just as bad as you wan na fuck 
I wan na fuck too 
 
No. No, No! You ain't got ta, say to much 
From the look in your eyes. 
I can tell you wan na fuck, 
 
And, you ain't got ta. Call me ya: boo 
Just as bad as you wan na fuck 
I wan na fuck too 
 
Now, you ain't, got ta, say much cuz. I was peepin. You 
Lookin at yo. Hips got me thinkin bout. How deep 
In you um tryin to go 
You heard about No Limit Soldiers 
We get up in it and hit it harder. Then De La Hoya 
I thought I told you soldier draws 
Cover my balls Um known for rippin, the pussy walls. 
I heard you got that kill 
I can see all in yo grill 
Can. You ride me like a black Mercedes 
And. Make me do that shit. I never did with other. Ladies 
I got a woman, so I'm not lookin for love. 
I, just wan na fit yo glove 
Get a couple of uh-uh's 
Shove it in your mouth, just like a thug, 
And uh hit me on my pager. If you want it, 
Its soldier passion 
So get up on it. If you want it, WHOA-WHOA 
, 
-, 
You ain't got ta, say too much 
From the look in your eyes. 
I can tell you wan na fuck, 
 
And, you ain't got ta. Call me ya: boo 
Just as bad as you wan na fuck 
I wan na fuck too 
 
No. No, No, you ain't got ta, say too much 
From the look in your eyes. 
I can tell you wan na fuck, 
 
And, you ain't got ta. Call me ya: boo 
Just as bad as you wan na fuck 
I wan na fuck too 
 
Put me on the counter in the kitchen 
Now baby pour my body with some ice cream. 
Lick me from head to toe 
Bending me over 
69'll. Be the next thing. 
I wan na taste, your body all night long, 
From, sun, up to sun down. I wan na make you moan 
 
You ain't got ta, say too much 
From the look in your eyes. 
I can tell you wan na fuck, 
 
And, you ain't got ta. Call me ya: boo 
Just as bad as you wan na fuck 
I wan na fuck too 
 
No. No, No, you ain't got ta, say too much 
From the look in your eyes. 
I can tell you wan na fuck, 
 
And, you ain't got ta. Call me ya: boo 
Just as bad as you wan na fuck 
I wan na fuck too 
 
Can. I light a candle 
And kiss you in the places. Light won't show 
I'll take my time and do it slow 
I'll. Do my oral exercises 
Right between your thighs 
It's, all very pleasurable I'll go places he won't go 
Lets, keep it on the low-low 
So. He won't know. 
Now lets. Take it to the floor. 
 
You ain't got ta, say too much, 
From the look in your eyes. 
I can tell you wan na fuck, 
 
And, you ain't got ta call me ya, boo 
Just as bad as you wan na fuck 
I wan na fuck, too 
 
No. No, No! You ain't got ta, say too much 
From. The look in your eyes. 
I can tell you wan na fuck, 
 
And, you ain't got ta call me ya: boo 
Just as bad as you wan na fuck 
I wan na fuck, too
