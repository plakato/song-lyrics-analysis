I Can Tell Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


You ain't gotta say too much.
From the look in your eyes.
I can tell you want to fuck.

And you ain't gotta call me ya boo.
Just as bad as you wanna fuck.
I wanna fuck too.

No, No, No you ain't gotta say to much.
From the look in your eyes.
I can tell you wanna fuck.

And you ain't gotta call me ya boo.
Just as bad as you wanna fuck.
I wanna fuck too.

Now you ain't gotta say much cuz I was peepin you.
Lookin at yo hips got me thinkin bout how deep.
In you um tryin to go.
You heard about No Limit Soldiers?
We get up in it and hit it harder then De La Hoya.
I thought I told you soldier draws.
Cover my balls, Um known for rippin the pussy walls.
I heard you got that kill.
I can see all in yo grill.
Can you ride me like a black Mercedes?
And make me do that shit I never did with other ladies?
I got a woman so I'm not lookin for love.
I just wanna fit yo glove.
Get a couple of uh-uh's.
Shove it in your mouth just like a thug.
And uh, hit me on my pager if you want it.
Its soldier passion.
So get up on it if you want it WHOA-WHOA!!!!

-.
You ain't gotta say too much.
From the look in your eyes.
I can tell you wanna fuck.

And you ain't gotta call me ya boo.
Just as bad as you wanna fuck.
I wanna fuck too.

No, No, No you ain't gotta say too much.
From the look in your eyes.
I can tell you wanna fuck.

And you ain't gotta call me ya boo.
Just as bad as you wanna fuck.
I wanna fuck too.

Put me on the counter in the kitchen.
Now baby pour my body with some ice cream.
Lick me from head to toe.
Bending me over.
69'll be the next thing.
I wanna taste your body all night long.
From sun up to sun down I wanna make you moan.

You ain't gotta say too much.
From the look in your eyes.
I can tell you wanna fuck.

And you ain't gotta call me ya boo.
Just as bad as you wanna fuck.
I wanna fuck too.

No, No, No you ain't gotta say too much.
From the look in your eyes.
I can tell you wanna fuck.

And you ain't gotta call me ya boo.
Just as bad as you wanna fuck.
I wanna fuck too.

Can I light a candle?
And kiss you in the places light won't show.
I'll take my time and do it slow.
I'll do my oral exercises.
Right between your thighs.
It's all very pleasurable, I'll go places he won't go.
Lets keep it on the low-low.
So he won't know.
Now lets take it to the floor.

You ain't gotta say too much.
From the look in your eyes.
I can tell you wanna fuck.

And you ain't gotta call me ya boo.
Just as bad as you wanna fuck.
I wanna fuck too.

No, No, No you ain't gotta say too much.
From the look in your eyes.
I can tell you wanna fuck.

And you ain't gotta call me ya boo.
Just as bad as you wanna fuck.
I wanna fuck too.
