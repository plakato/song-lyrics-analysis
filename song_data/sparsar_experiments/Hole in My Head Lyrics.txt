Hole in My Head Lyrics
by Quill.

It seems so slowly giving in.
I see the black hole, please begin.
To wreck my 1999.
Chill out this shattered soul of mine.

Hole in my head.
Hole in my head.

Let far begining is the end.
Let me return to yesterday.

It comes the other once again.
I'll lay before you.
I'll lay before you.

Hole in my head.
Hole in my head.
Well there's a hole in my head.
Hole in my head.

Ooh when I was giving you the seal.
Now I am you and you are me.

Hole in my head.
Hole in my head.
Well there's a hole in my head.
Hole in my head.
