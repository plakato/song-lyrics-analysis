by Ty Dolla $ign.


She's an actress, actress, actress, actress, actress, actress, actress,.

She's a natural, natural, natural actress, natural actress, natural actress.

Ty Dolla $ign.
The director in this bitch, blockbuster in this bitch.
Sex producer, lights, camera, action in this bitch.
We all off in this bitch, and I'm all off in that ass.
I'm way past the speed limit, yeah I'm driving it fast.
Somethin' out of a magazine she belong on TV.
She remind me of a pornstar the way she put it on me.

Ty Dolla $ign &amp; _R. Kelly_.
She's an actress, actress, actress, actress, actress, actress, actress,.

She's a natural, natural, natural actress, natural actress, natural actress.

_Damn she good, damn, damn she good.
Damn she good, damn, damn she good_.

R. Kelly.
Health club in this bitch.
We working out in this bitch.
Crazy sex, get ignorant, that's going dumb in this bitch.
Yeah she's a star out this flick.
Give her five stars in this bitch.
Shawty know the whole routine, she ain't gotta practice this shit.
Some out of a magazine she belong on TV.
She remind me of a pornstar the way she put it on me.

Ty Dolla $ign &amp; _R. Kelly_.
She's an actress, actress, actress, actress, actress, actress, actress,.

She's a natural, natural, natural actress, natural actress, natural actress.

_Damn she good, damn, damn she good.
Damn she good, damn, damn she good_.

So good, so good, she's so good.

Malik Yusef Speaks.
At midnight the genius stroke the fuck outta you.
Baby girl you hit this the wrong way it choke the fuck outta you.
I rap you in these sheets and smoke the fuck outta you.
Hit you with this D properly and turn a cluck outta you.
Maybe in the morning I can get a buck outta you.
If your credit is on point get a truck outta you.
Do the fuck I gotta do, you a fan.
