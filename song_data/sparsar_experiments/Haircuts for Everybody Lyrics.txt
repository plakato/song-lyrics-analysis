Haircuts for Everybody Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

I'm afraid to think of ending it.
You'll forget to sleep.
You'll forget its name.
It gradually became obvious.

There is no us, but there is no I.
We believe, we deny.
We will change, we won't die.
We won't stay, just try to be OK.
A foot in the snow with no boot on its skin.
We have reason to stay, but we never commit.
Haven't you held someone's breath all along?
Hearing movement around us.

Change your life.
Please, change your life.
Change my life.
Please, change my life.

We spent the last twenty-three minutes hallucinating over the phone.
I kept both my hands still while we saw the same building explode.
Wreck this thing.
Please, take it off the ground.
