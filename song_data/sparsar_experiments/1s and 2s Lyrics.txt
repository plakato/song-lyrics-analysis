1s and 2s Lyrics
by Punsy.


It'S, the NEW DUDE WHO KNEW I'd, CHOOSE YOU to CHEW: THROUGH
Like FRUIT, CHEWS. True BLUE you're, BOO BOO, like USED FOOD

DO, YOU SHOOT DUDES with TWO TWOS. It'S FOOL: PROOF
Convince the fans, you're COO COO, a killer man with SCREW'S LOOSE

You WACK CATS LIVE IN worlds of FICTION. Like BLUES CLUES
I HAVE FACTS that gives rappers QUICK ENDS like NEWS. Crews

You, TOUGH THUGS LIE LIKE you: HAVE CASH SCREW YOU 
Your NEW COUPE is an IZUZU with a MOON, ROOF

 .... I saw you spit on YOUTUBE in a HUGE GROUP
I BOOED YOU and LAUGHED AT your BAD ACT like the GOOF TROOP

You're, MAD WACK .... This IS HOW CROWDS VIEW YOU
We LAUGH AT YOU, DUDE FROWN NOW and BOO HOO

I SPOOK CREWS, cuz. I TRY to END THEM like FUBU
 ..., YOU LOSE, everybody feels me like a LOOSE TOOTH

 ... beat HITTIN' like a POOL. Cue
A COOL FEW have my name on their tongue like BLUE JUICE

 ..., the KNOWN PRO with DOPE FLOW, that's LOCO
I'm! So BOLD. I force fed COLD STONE to STONE, COLD

NO JOKE I'll. Do this til I DIE like FLOJO
There's, NO HOPE. Your careers go BYE, BYE, like JO BROS

OH. No, My motto is: GO DOPE or GO HOME
I, don't need to SHOW BOAT bout, DOUGH, HOES or POLOS

ON DOMES like SOUL, GLOW you're SO SO and HOMO
Everything you drop, makes ME SLEEP like YO-YOS

Now, I'm wondering where's the good RAP AT
I! Listen to these songs losing MINUTES. I can't HAVE BACK

Two words to deSCRIBE GUYS ASS CRACK
And. What'S worse, all these GUYS LIE THAT'S SAD

At least, stick to the subject like a HASHTAG
You. Don'T make sense like WHITE GUYS with BLACK DADS

 .... I want my CASH BACK
If. You ever SEE ME duck like you're repreSENTIN', Aflack

I've SPLIT MEN, like SLIM JIMS, when they've BITTEN, my WRITTENS
When MENTIONED by CRITICS They've. Given me TEN TENS

I'm DRIVEN like ENGINES, I'm QUICK WHEN I'm SPITTIN'
My LYRICS can feel like a SENTENCE in PRISON

I'm TIGHT. My LINES can last up to a LIFETIME
WHY LIE. It'S MY TIME. You passed it to the RIGHT GUY

Every track's, a HIGHLIGHT of MY KIND of NICE RHYME

I spit for haters, and it's KILLIN''em inSIDE. Why 
Cuz, I'm just amazing and I'm STEALIN', all the LIMELIGHT

 ... I'M FLY as a SKY KITE
But, I'm not STUCK UP like a LIGHT. Bright

Bars ARE sharper than the blade in a KNIFE FIGHT
Oops. I meant I'm sharper than Blade in a NIGHT FIGHT

 ... The source gave me FIVE MICS NINE TIMES
Cuz. These GUYS BITE like the WHITE GUY from TWILIGHT
