Dolly Rocker Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

Dolly Rocker... It's called Dolly Rocker... It's an old make of dress....
Well, months old, you know.. that sort of thing).

I know a sweet girl.
She done went out and paid for me.
Was a sweet girl.
After five we went for tea.
She seen a Dolly Rocker.
She want a girl, she got her.
I wanna see her, I know I do.
I love you darling, all for you.

You want to meet Pearl?
She's as cute as a squirrel's nut.
She done seen me.
Said she thought she got the lot.
She's a Dolly Rocker.
Want to wait 'till I got her.
Said she knew I know we know I do.
Said she gotta see me lonely with you.

Oceans may travel, away too long.
Senses in the gravel, to see yourself at home.
Nice to be at home.
All I'll ever do forever.
All my life, you see, when you got her.
All I know, you know, I show you, baby.
Through your head push to you, baby.
Is a Dolly Rocker.
She know what she got her.
She seen a Dolly Rocker.
She seen a Dolly Rocker.
