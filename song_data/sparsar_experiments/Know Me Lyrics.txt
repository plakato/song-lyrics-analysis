Know Me Lyrics

Tag :.
Yo Ruga I feel you on this one boy.

Came from a long way.
And people still ask me why I chose to do this.
I kissed my momma, I said I gave up everything for the music.
One day I woke up, I was in the Ville with nobody else.
That's when I realized I had to be strong and founded myself.
Back with the squad and we hungry as hell.
Fuck the professor who got me expelled.
Cause now me and Kainey got big clientele.
I said me and Kainey, that's right, me and Kainey.
No love for the snakes.
I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I trap out the house.
Then I'm back on the plane.
I do not know 'bout another clique who really got it like this.
Cooking the fire and I'm saucing the pan.
Then I'm done with my shift, flipping the switch.
And you know he's a snitch if he flicking the wrist.
That's what he did, that's what he did.
And I took his bitch.

They don't know my name, no.
They don't know where I come from.
They don't know what it took for me.
To get up and leave and not say nothin'.
They don't know me, no no.
They don't know me, nah.
They don't know me, no no.
They don't know me, nah.

They don't know us man.
They don't fucking know us.
Kaine, yeah.

Came from a long way.
And people still ask me why I don't go party.
I kissed my girl and I told her I'd be back for more than a party.
One day I woke up, I was in the Ville with nobody else.

Now we stocking the shelf.
Working the movement, I'm working the movement.
I'm hungry as hell.
Fuck all the kids who be working about.
Cause they don't put the work in to flourish themselves.
Fuck you thought it was boy? Don't trust boy.
I'm a straight shooter, no cuts boy.
With a wrist swole, no cuffs boy.
Giving it, giving it, giving it up for the squad, clean.
And we wild out.
Fuck parents friends, I got dividends.
They make fun and I pile out.
Vroom, vroom on they old ass.
I got full pass then I'm cashing out.
That's what we did, that's what we did.
Check my account.

They don't know my name, no.
They don't know where I come from.
They don't know what it took for me.
To get up and leave and not say nothin'.
They don't know me, no no.
They don't know me, nah.
They don't know me, no no.
They don't know me, nah.

They don't know us man.
They don't fucking know us.

Yeah, look... I came from a long way.
And people still asking why I ain't make it.
Nigga be patient, imma sensation.
I want no relation, just wanna see you naked.
I just want that paper, ya'll niggas be hating.
Live life everyday and it's a fucking celebration.
The throne for the taking, so watch me take it.
All the problems I'm facing, ain't no time to be wasting.
Drive these hoes crazy, but it ain't no saving.
I want the guap and the hustle don't stop.
On my way to the top, drop top, fuck cops.
Yeah, I just want yo spot and yo ass will get knocked.
Yeah, and that's what's gon' happen, that's what gon' happen.
Got it on lock.

They don't know my name, no.
They don't know where I come from.
They don't know what it took for me.
To get up and leave and not say nothin'.
They don't know me, no no.
They don't know me, nah.
They don't know me, no no.
They don't know me, nah.

They don't know us man.
They don't fucking know us.
