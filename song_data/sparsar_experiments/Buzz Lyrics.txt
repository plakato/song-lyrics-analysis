Buzz Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


A very interesting character is a wealthy land, owner. educated in England, 
very good family., but this man is the business brain and drug overlord of an
empire that stretches across the andes. he's. Not your ordinary drug, dealer
, 
Range roover. Take you on an island 
Came up stacks and now im wildin' 
I love all my boys. I smoke soo much, I'm smilin' 
Can't leave. Now we just started climbin' 
Double cup drug I'mma start a riot 
I've been smokin' all day, but I ain't high. Yet 
I can take you on a jet and make you flyin' 
Champagne on lean bitch. You know, I'm flyin', 
 
I know what you think. I'M soo psychic 
I bring my bitch with me. Just like a sidekick 
Pop white seeds call her molly 
I, don't pop molly. No more guess, I'm retired 
I see big dogs when I walk through the fire. 
Take me up to the gods where I'm higher 
All white buildings. All I hear is sirens 
I just rolled a blunt who got a lighter 
I just rolled a blunt who got a lighter 
Range roover. Take you on an island 
Came up stacks and now im wildin', wildin', 
I love all my boys. I smoke soo much. I'M smilin'
