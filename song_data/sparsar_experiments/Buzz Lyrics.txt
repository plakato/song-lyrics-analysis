Buzz Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


A very interesting character is a wealthy land owner. educated in England,.
very good family. but this man is the business brain and drug overlord of an.
empire that stretches across the andes. he's not your ordinary drug dealer.

Range roover take you on an island.
Came up stacks and now im wildin'.
I love all my boys, I smoke soo much I'm smilin'.
Can't leave now, we just started climbin'.
Double cup, drug, I'mma start a riot.
I've been smokin' all day, but I ain't high yet.
I can take you on a jet and make you flyin'.
Champagne on lean, bitch you know I'm flyin'.

I know what you think, i'm soo psychic.
I bring my bitch with me just like a sidekick.
Pop white seeds, call her molly.
I don't pop molly no more, guess I'm retired.
I see big dogs when I walk through the fire.
Take me up to the gods where I'm higher.
All white buildings, all I hear is sirens.
I just rolled a blunt, who got a lighter?
I just rolled a blunt, who got a lighter?
Range roover, take you on an island.
Came up stacks and now im wildin', wildin'.
I love all my boys, I smoke soo much I'm smilin'.
