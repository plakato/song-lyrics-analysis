It's All About Dun Dun Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

And check lights.
And move alongs.
And shouting hearts.
And shaping thoughts.
They're all to blame.
With cigarrettes.
But none do fame.
It tickles.
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
Yeah i'll be fine.
Yeah i'll be fine.
Yeah i'll be fine fine fine fine.
Fine fine fine fine fine fine fine.
We won't be home tonight.
We'll be traveling.
We'll be getting to know ourselves.
We won't be home tonight.
There's a rhythm in me.
There's a rhythm in you.
We won't be home tonight.
They'll be calling us names.
We'll be chasing the moon.
We won't be home tonight.
We'll be gone gone gone.
Gone gone gone gone gone gone.
And the shellac's done.
And the shakedown.
And the dream awakes.
And multiplies.
So let us die.
We have no shame.
It's this city that lied at twilight.
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
Yeah i'll be fine.
Yeah i'll be fine.
Yeah i'll be fine fine fine fine.
Fine fine fine fine fine fine fine.
This ain't no, fever, no no no....
