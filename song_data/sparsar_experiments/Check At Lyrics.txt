Cartier Dave.
Gold mouth villian.
Cartier Chillin'.
With a bitch with low melanin.
Looking like I'm peddling.
Pay me tithes.
Pay me tithes cause I'm heaven sent.
Pay me tithes.
Cause I hustle like the reverend.
Feed these bitches medicine, ay.
Fix ya face.
Baby sniffing off the plate.
No I can't relate.
I just give her what she needs.
So she can grab her date.
But she know not to fuck with me.
Better have my cake.
Don't be late, ay.
Fani know I got them hoes at bay.
I'm with Fani watching hoes go gay.
On the 20th flo'.
Look what they do for the blow.
And the ask why I don't trust these hoes.
I let em go.

I've been coming down for a long time.
That shit you holding on to, now it's all mine.
If it ain't about that check, don't hit my phoneline.
You say you don't owe me, boy, you know you lyin'.
Now where my check at?
