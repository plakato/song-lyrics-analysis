3rd Ward Court Date Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..


It all started in the streets at the age of ten.
I started hangin' out late snatchin' purses with my friends.

Lookin' for a white lady that was peepin' id.
I see one in sight skin was white as a duck.
She just don't fuckin' know I'm bout to show her boo-koo love.
I'm bout to beat her up so I asked the ho the time.
She looked down and broke her crown she bent down.
Stupid clown I jetted with her purse and I hear some.
Gangster's whisper found slug and some coke.
That was stashed by a bush bill twenty worth of coke.
With a snug I'm feelin' hard I'm eighty strong from the third.
I scored a fuckin' quarter jetted quick down to Fossil.
So I slipped now I'm caught.

In jail, I used to rap rap rap.
Rap shit everyday now the name of.
My rap is third ward court date.
I used to rap rap rap.
Rap shit everyday now the name of.
My rap is third ward court date.

Three cops and I'm caught I can't believe.
They got me locked down up in this place.
My first offense and I caught myself a murder case.
Parish Prison Blues gave me no time to choose.
I either get myself a knifer or be taken by yo lifer.
Shit my woman still sendin' me money.
Thinkin' I'm a come back home.
I like to think that way but evidence shown.
Prints plus a murder weapon.
I'm up shit creek watchin' for vanish on the proud.
Got me losin' sleep I'm gettin' lots of letters.
But I don't give a fuck I'm stuck like Chuck and she.
Wouldn't put the house up.
Will I get probation?
Or will I get free? I'm facin' the court date.
My destination is the three.

2x.

Layin' in my cut thinkin' of a deaf rhyme.
Got to make it short because I don't have a lot of time.
I'm seein' old gee's from the past.
Smart like a motherfucker I wonder how they last.
Niggas had fades, and bushes and shit.
Just like on the street the third was runnin' it.
You couldn't step close to the blue.
Like Jefferson said Ya fat I thought you knew?
Here again with the Juror food for days that's what.
The motherfucker kept I'm chillin' in lower nine.
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind.
Ced on parole he's in the house with a boot in his mouth.
Boot up back and make him knock it out.
Gangster's on the phone talkin' to them hoes.
Call Sterol on the three and do a pere.
Cuz I'm a villain and I'm chillin'.
In CCC31.

Up early in the mornin' time to catch the.
White Bangor the roof so we can.
Put the heat in my back.
I caught the first charge.
The coke charge a.
Gun charge to sittin' in the U' stun'n.
What the fuck am I gonna do.
I'm chillin' in my jail cell talkin' to the attorney.
He said did you pull the trigger if so your goin' on.
A long journey on the court session.
Standin' tall like a man.
They got my feet, and arms shackled I'm.
Holdin' my right hand.
I caught juvenile life plus a extra to exist.
Like my nigga Tec said.
Peewee's fuckin' playhouse don't want them havin' fun.
Cuz all our strafe a cation clucker a sucker that ain't no gun.
My heat is smokin' I'm thinkin' hard all you fake ass new jack.
Pussy better hold that noise they must see what I see.
Yes, I'm big I'm bad I'm buff motherfuck that p.t. shit.
Cuz here I come to bust here come the guard Friday night.
At night no more visitation he leave sit back ain't shit.
I'm bout to take a lil' vacation bog boy be chillin'.
And I'm from that one two three.
But you better be cool before he slang you with that heat now.
I'm buckin' in the hole nigga be real don't shed no tears.
Cuz early Thursday mornin' bitch I'm goin' to Styleville.

I Call my nigga Baby he's at the office.
Doin' paper work try'na get me out.
But his lawyer actin' like a murk.
Feedin' him the wrong arm damn right.
We had to communicate to keep shit tight.
I sit at the kite some nights.
When I flight and write.
To my niggas and bitches who was close and all right.
May the ninth was my court date.
No witness no gun so they threw away the case.
I was free July the twelfth down for armed robbery.
Imagine how a nigga felt and fuck that judge.
Because that bitch came late.
Try'na give me time on my third ward court date.

2x.
