What You Know Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.


In a few weeks.
I will get time to realize.
It's right before my eyes.
And I can take it.
If it's what I want to do.
I am leaving.
And this is starting.
To feel like it's before my eyes.
And I can taste it.
It's my sweet beginning.

And I can tell just what you want.
You don't want to be alone.
You don't want to be alone.
And I can't say it's what you know.
But you've known it the whole time.
Yeah, you've known it the whole time.

Maybe next year, I'll have no time.
To think about the questions to address.
Am I the one to try to stop the fire.
I wouldn't test you.
I'm not the best you could have obtained.
Why try anything?
I will get there.
Just remember, I know.

And I can tell just what you want.
You don't want to be alone.
You don't want to be alone.
And I can't say it's what you know.
But you've known it the whole time.
Yeah, you've known it the whole time.
