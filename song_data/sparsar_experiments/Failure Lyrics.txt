Failure Lyrics
by Unearth.

What have we done?
Never thought that life would come to this.
Eternal sense of self hatred.
Blame not who, but ask us why we did.
This is an open book of failure.
Deceive ourselves all the we can, so we can be.
Cycle of life disrupted.
Halted by a force too close to home.
Guilt runs through our blood.
Close your eyes and let yourself forget.
This guilt runs on and on.
Consumed our senses gone.
Torn; these wings of spirit.
Godless relations.
Scar this heart beyond all hope to heal.
This being won't meet this world.
I know I'll take this to my grave.
All but saved.
Die for us my child.
This is an open book of failure.
Deceive ourselves all that we can, so we can be.
I walk each step in anger.
Found fault in our design.
Now I kneel down to pray.
To pread for a better time.
In hopes to awake from this.
Die My Child.
