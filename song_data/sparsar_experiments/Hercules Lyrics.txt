Hercules Lyrics
by Ty.


Heyyy, youuu!

Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school.
And I remember school then. You was the bully.
And I was one of the children.

You used to treat me like dirt and hurt my inners.
I already knew the school paid for my dinners.
That's right, flares were worn, shoes were torn.
I was the subject of scorn, wondering why I was born.
While you - you had it all.
You was the rude boy plus the bad boy at football.
You couldn't be touched with a barge pole.
You was the captain of the ship and we was the cargo.
You used to play pat ball, you hated me so much.
Much so because I gave you low cuts - the cuts below.
'Cos it was my only defence, against.
A Hercules figure that was this much bigger.
Extra, extra, vexed and sorta very violent.
That's why it was best to always keep quiet.

You was up North and I was definitely South.

You was up North and I was definitely South.

Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school.
Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school.
And I remember school then. You was the bully.
And I was one of the children.

Now, who's the brother with the brand new kicks?
Kiss chasing all the chicks, pocket full of 'Swizzle Sticks'.
'Bazooka Bubblegum', 'Space Dust' and 'Wham!'.
Technicolour bed fluff meant I wasn't the man.
For kiss chase, now that was real life trauma.
Girls would break down and cry if I caught them in the corner.
I guess it was my Elvis Presley sheep skin jacket.
And my holy toes were peeking outside my socks and outside my shoes.
Got a lot of stress from you and you and you.
Still, life's a game, and I guess I'm a learner.
Used to fantasize about my neighbour's 'Rally Burner'.
All I wanted in life was a 'Grifter'.
Got fed up, went and stole one with my sister.
We rode all day, at the end we put it back.
Couldn't have took it home, I would've received slaps.
On my D-O-M-E, you see my mummy.
She would've slapped me on my B stroke S-I-D-E.
For trying to do such conforming to other peoples needs.
Now I'm learning the game with speed, Hercules.
Trying to do such conforming to other peoples needs.
Now I'm learning the game with speed, Hercules.

Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school.
Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school.
And I remember school then. You was the bully.
And I was one of the children.

Now, I know, that school was a long time ago and.
You probably feel that y'know.
You don't have to account for your actions, and I don't want you to.
I just want you to know one thing.
Y'know maybe one two or three things.
I am now bigger, better, smarter, sexier, I'm the man!
Just take away my rubbish alright? Thank you.
