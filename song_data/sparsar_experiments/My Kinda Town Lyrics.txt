My Kinda Town Lyrics
by The Undead.


I'm lost in a twilight zone.
Ain't got no mind of my own.
I took some kind of pill.
Now I can't get my fill.
I see the junkies and I see the whores.
I don't know why but it all seems a bore.
They don't give me no thrill.
It turns my stomach, I'm getting ill.
New York City! You're my kinda town.
My kinda people just hangin' around.
New York City! You're my kinda town.
My kinda people just hangin' around.
My mom and dad wanna lock me away.
Don't give a f**k, they got nothin' to say.
I'm gonna do it anyway.
You wanna play? Yeah, I wanna play.
New York City! You're my kinda town.
My kinda people just hangin' around.
New York City! You're my kinda town.
My kinda people just hangin' around.
I'm lost in a twilight zone.
Ain't got no mind of my own.
I took some kind of pill.
Now I can't get my fill.
New York City! You're my kinda town.
My kinda people just hangin' around.
New York City! You're my kinda town.
My kinda people just hangin' around.
New York City! New York City! New York City!
