Black Suits Fill the Room Lyrics
by Vokab.


Baby there's a shark in the water.
Named BLESS, upstaging the top performers.
Was there from the start of the slaughter.
When I go off like a shot from a sawed off, this was the cocked warning, sort.
off*.
Eh eh eh, hands off this shit.
I'll off you, QUICK as the black dude in a horror flick.
This, artist spits SARS every song I rip.
Got fans coming out the blue like some former Crips.
I'm from the corner strip, that's lawless.
You be an informant, eating lunch with officers feeding the sergeant tips.
HEART, of a martyr, shit these bars I spit.
Are like folks related fucking, they just come out retarded kid*.
I'm guarded with an arm looking like cable in the X Force.
You less than a pawn, you a checkers piece on my chessboard.
N.I.N.O, real heads.
know.
I go, harder than acid trippers bopping to techno.
