The Rules Lyrics
by XO-IQ.

Why d'ya think you got to be better.
Who said.
Who said that you need to go and change.

Can't you find a tighter sweater.
Well we say.
Come with us and learn the game.

Don't listen, don't you listen.
Come with us we're on a mission.
You should be yourself and glisten now.

There's a way you should be talking.
Follow us the way we're walking.
If you want that cute boy callin' you.

Don't listen to a word they're saying.
We'll be 5 star hotel staying.
80 million hits and playing, too.

The rules.
The rules.
The rules.

Now they want your lips to be redder.
And they say.
OMG your skirt's too long.

Come with us and the boys will be better.
Yeah we say.
Come with us and it's game on.

Don't listen, don't you listen.
Come with us we're on a mission.
You should be yourself and glisten now.

There's a way you should be talking.
Follow us the way we're walking.
If you want that cute boy callin' you.

Don't listen to a word they're saying.
We'll be 5 star hotel staying.
80 million hits and playing, too.

The rules.
The rules.
The rules.

And now we're feeling like we're all, we're all for one.
Don't you remember lit last fall semester's done.
When Dumas said it's one and one for all.

There's a way you should be talking.
Follow us the way we're walking.
If you want that cute boy callin' you.

Don't listen to a word they're saying.
We'll be 5 star hotel staying.
80 million hits and playing, too.

The rules.
The rules.
The rules.
