16 dollars in a back street corner is enough for a beautiful day.
I see a window open, hearing Aerosmith rocking with a Dick Brave Walk This.

I need a quick drink more volume for the beat I see the cats are playing dice.
It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money to a fat lady singing boogie.

I've been walking the streets again.
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again *Woah*.
Just to see what the day will bring.
But it's the same old song I'll do it again.

I'll bring you home my baby I will.
I would love to bring you home.
I would love to bring her home.
I would love to bring you home.
