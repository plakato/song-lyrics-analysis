Yo, I came up in the game quick, son.
Never hesitating, making my view alleviated from societal regulations.
Put up on your mind, runnin' yo mind, it's my time to shine.
I be done with this shit son, cause I'm coming from behind.
Yeah, and Ima do what's right for my fan.
I'm the man with the plan and I don't give a damn.
I'm the new sensation, hustlin' worldwide.
Doin' what I gotta do, son, to survive.
Get my niggas out the trap, you can bet that.
Ima get the mouth with the shit that I spit about.
Cause I get the chedda on a regular basis.
Gotta keep on going in the ayeeh....

I wanna just fly away.
So I can be free.
Where no-one can judge me.
And just doin' me.

Uhh yeah, can't stop with this shit that I drop.
Cause I got a lot of muthafuckin' neck, son.
I get it.
On a daily basis, day-to-day gettin' it in.
Uhh yeah, one day they will understand the real scope of my plans.
Cause not giving a hoot got a deeper meaning than anything.
Just think, yeah, cause I gotta do what's right in the end.
And I'm never gonna stop, cause this shit ain't pretend.
Yeah son, this ain't a damn joke, doin' what I want.
Get all the bread, get all the chedda like Chuck E. Cheese.
Gettin' all the chedda and I'm gettin' it with ease.
Yeah uhh, doin' what I want.
I don't give a hoot, I don't give a hoot.

I wanna just fly away.
So I can be free.
Where no-one can judge me.
Ima just be me.
