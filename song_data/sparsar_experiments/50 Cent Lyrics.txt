How To Rob.

I don't know whatcha' heard about me.
A label can't get a dollar outta' me.
No Cadillac or M's will move me.
Cause I'm a mutha' fukkin' K-I-N-G.
I don't know whatcha' heard about me.
A label can't get a dolla' outta' me.
No Cadillac, no M's will move me.
I won't sign my name on that L-I-L-I-N-E.

Labels fly me out, they act like they don't know my numba'.
But it's ok, cause you don't count to me unless you stunta'.
That shit you offered was for slaves, you better add some commas.
They read my ego, then divorced, yeah I used to love her.

I'm in my own lane.
Fuck you and your name.
I know I'm bubbling, Imma' 'bout to burst.
Labels stay home, while I been stealing first.
I can drop any second and fuck up your whole third.
Quarter.

I don't know whatcha' heard about me.
A label can't get a dollar outta' me.
No Cadillac or M's will move me.
Cause I'm a mutha' fukkin' K-I-N-G.
I don't know whatcha' heard about me.
A label can't get a dolla' outta' me.
No Cadillac, no M's will move me.
I won't sign my name on that L-I-L-I-N-E.

Labels coming at me sideways as if I don't notice.
Just stand correct and put the money up, I might approach it.
I got some promises I need to keep, I need to oath shit.
I see the car, I see the house, man I just need to own it.

I'm in my own lane.
Fuck you and your name.
I know I'm bubbling, Imma' 'bout to burst.
Labels stay home, while I been stealing first.
I can drop any second and fuck up your whole third.
Quarter.

I don't know whatcha' heard about me.
A label can't get a dollar outta' me.
No Cadillac or M's will move me.
Cause I'm a mutha' fukkin' K-I-N-G.
I don't know whatcha' heard about me.
A label can't get a dolla' outta' me.
No Cadillac, no M's will move me.
I won't sign my name on that L-I-L-I-N-E.

I won't sign my name on that L-I-N-E.

You know I had to do P.I.M.P.
What up 50!?
Fuck wit' me!
Yeah!
I can show you How to Rob.
I can show you How to Rob.
I can show you How to Rob.
I can show you How to mutha' fukkin' Rob.
