Best Things in Life Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

I've got a saying in my life that's got me by so far.
If you want something done you got to do it yourself.
Because nothing comes easy for a man like me.
If they ever give you something too easily.

Everybody thinks the best things in life are free.
I'll do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me.
He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree.

I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me.
IF it comes down to fisting, mister that ain't nothing new to me.
You got to get your hands dirty when it's something that you really need.

If your looking for trouble step outside of this bar.

Can't be too good, cause nothing good's for free.
Well it mat not be right but, nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong.
If they would open their eyes it'd be so plain to see.
Tell ya' straight from the heart a bed of roses it will never be.
That the best things in life don't come so easily.
It would have been alright but he pushed me too far.
You'll find in this life if there's something that you believe.
The first mistake is leave it up to somebody else.
