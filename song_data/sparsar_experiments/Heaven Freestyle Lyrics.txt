Heaven Freestyle Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


Growing up, high school was just like a prison.
Showing up to fight dudes who just might be itchin'.
To catch their first bodies;.
Dope-boys in trainin'.
With magnums and shotties \-.
No overstatement.
I smacked the wrong cholo.

Why WAS I alone, though?
Now that I look back, I was supposed to have met with JoJo.
You know, though... No show.
Long story short: Dislocated jaw.
Popped it back in place on my own like a boss.
Stayed away from home so my mama wouldn't see.
She picked up an overnight gig, luckily for me.
I was back on my G-shit - the top cat.
Heathcliff couldn't intimidate me with 2 swat cats; I was THE sh*t.
And I STILL am flowing I'm sea-sick.
Beastin' on my own shit or just re-mixing your weak shit.
Nigga peep this....
I hopped on the 1 train in search of a cheap trick.
Locked on to one dame, perched up on her seat.
With her iPod on, with sum'n playing, which made her lovely feet click.
Was it a rock song, was it country, spoken word, dub-step, a remix of them.
all?
Why was she hyphy?
Shit was eating me inside, B.
My playlist was redundant. Hers seemed so exciting.
So, I asked her, what'chu bumpin'? as I tried to peek down her scoop neck.

And she answered, a little something my best friend sent me call 'Roof Deck.
'..
Now don't look at me like some chap who's just plain nosey.
But who put you on?
Oh, my catty friend named, Josie.
WHAT?! Now, isn't that shit dope?
No..
Ahh, fuck you, fuck me and fuck this song; I'm ghost..
