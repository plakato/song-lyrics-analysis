Love Burns Lyrics
by 60 Second Assassin.

60 Second Assassin.
I should have known from the start, as long as we've been apart.
Love can never love from a far.
Too much absence can change direction and rod.
Separation is world we facing, can you call on God?
When your rib dial 9-1-1 same deck, different cards.
We dealing in.
It's my house but they got me walking around in the wilderness.
And my heart is feeling it, a brother nearly looses his mind.
Baby can we stop mixing our live with the swine?
Be adults and handle shit in our time.
We don't need a second emotion; all we need is a lil time.
While mankind leads the blind, they want future District Attorney.
Where only whites shine.
What's the opposite of a black collar crime?
And a black swallow time and the feel is 1779?

Prodigal Sunn 2x.
Love is reality, life is filled with flattery.
Love be the batteries, life be the prince of palities.
Right, you live and you learn, you lose your earn.
Confuse and concern, remember love burns.
It's real.

Prodigal Sunn.
I was shocked when she first told me baby it's over.
Packing her bags, I'm moving out, I'm taking the Rover.
Stay cool, played my composure, smile on my face.
You bugging out over some small shit.
Hurry up and race, okay, state your case.
No need us to waste.
I was real when your baby even slowed my pace.
Anytime, anywhere, all the streets that you aced.
Your number one better showed you things that really do matter.
End of the chapter, leaving in some devilish rapture.
The here and the after, twisting up some green pastures.
Reminisce the times and the laughter.
Love you around the situations.
Complications didn't allow it to work.
You wanted it to work and it don't work.
That's when it hurts.
Forgot the loyalty entrust.
She was doing me dirt, I was taught you live and you learn.
You lose your earn, confuse and concern, remember love burns.

Phillie.
Uh, I did a lot of dirt, caught a few cases, a true felon.
Been gelling since my youth states.
You name it I've done it and seen it first hand.
My homie was murder in cold blood, it hurts man.
After all I've been thru, I'm a smarter now.
So rational, I'm strong for my daughter now.

Teaching the facts of life, prepare for the afterlife.
Focus on what's important, money ain't everything.
Make sure the man you choose present you with a wedding ring.
Control your material lust.
I look up her face would of appear in the sun.
Keep shining girl, your design is pearl.
And diamond refined in a timeless world.
Daddy's little princess, I meant it.
Whatever you want it, spend hours in the studio to get that.
Had a dream, she lost me to the streets, and so I stopped slanging.
Became God's Son instead of Son of Satan.
Virtue, marry the women that birthed you.
Yeah, I came full of circle there's nothing I can't work thru.

Prodigal Sunn 2x.
