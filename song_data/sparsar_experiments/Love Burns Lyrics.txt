Love Burns Lyrics
by 60 Second Assassin.

60 Second Assassin 
I should have known from the start as long as we've been apart, 
Love can never love from a far 
Too much absence can change direction and rod. 
Separation is world we facing. Can you call on God 
When your rib dial, 9-1-1 same deck, different cards, 
We dealing in 
It's, my house, but they got me walking around in the wilderness 
And. My heart is feeling it a brother, nearly looses his mind. 
Baby. Can we stop mixing our live with the swine 
Be adults and handle shit in our time? 
We don't need a second emotion.
