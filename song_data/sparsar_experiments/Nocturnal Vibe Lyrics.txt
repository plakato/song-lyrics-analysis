Nocturnal Vibe Lyrics
by Vivekverma.

Interlude.
Hey buddy what time it is now.
Its sharp 10 o clock boy.
Oh its my time to go bed count to sheep and hit the sack.
So here i go.

I wake in hypnic jerk when nightmare.
Always bug me outta sleep ,fight fear as might twice.
Headphones on my head is blare , i feel vigour.
Back to normal found ink to smear for my rhymes clear.
Now i can sense a scent of excitment inside of music science.
Its night my eyes lookin sky , too much bright and shine so clock.
Tickin in drippin sound and i mighta been thinkin.
When the sun is out off the horrizon swimmin and.
Gust of wind blowin ,voices in my head is sanguine.
I wished upon a shootin star walk a mile and take a smile.
Imma cold soul roving on the road alone , prayin to almighty god-.
Salvage me off this world of dark.
Vivek you need to be the underneath of the lotus feet.
And dont you need to worry , hearin every single word , m everywhere in accord.
For the back support, so the fact i heard yer soul.
Hands on my head though fall to my knees.
Everything u said real i can feel its trance that just.
Build the strength on my weak shoulder blade.
When i was ,cuz trust bleak shy and awkward ehh!
But i swear the love we share is rare and more fatastical.
The whole world knows yer mysticism and thanks.
A lot for this causeless mercy that ya.
Bestow upon me god whoa-a-ow.

Without of music my life is broken peice of glass.
Marshall mather the only reason of this magic that have.
Had happened mostly chaneled my life station.
Through dead to wagon back exact.

Life is full of suprises either that its more hoard.
Even though it open door for new ejoyment.
The sky is fallin with a cloud of love.
Must be just to bust the dust of the ego and a buggin lust.
So focus strong.
Life is so beautifull and honey sweet.
And everyday is a whole new chapter illuminin.
And its echo follow till tommorow today is the process.
With a shadow.
Now i know i already hit the lotto in a pronto!
I come around to sing this song for everyone hey!
He , me ,you, and they on my way.
In the empty pocket not a penny in the pants.
Walkin down to the lane.
M back in my attic and the sun is out.
I guess what i hear is birds chirpin all around.
M back in my attic and the sun is out.
So night is gone m cock a hoop and almost cool.
Ya'll unite with divine for rest of life for all good.

Yo yo wait its time to cheerio from a studio so i say a sayanora to all of yo.
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
