Black Hand Inn Lyrics
by Running Wild.

A scarred and rakish seadog, mysterious opacity.
Walks the grove, the phantom's home.
Cuts down firs where men would flee.
Wooden beams and mortal, the timber shack is taking shape.
The tavern's baptized Black Hand Inn.
A blackened hand shines on the plate.

Welcome to the tavern in the grove.
Where ancient spirits live and rove.

The tavern has been opened, the owner is Mr. John Xenir.
A rumour says he has second sight.
A chance to prove restrains their fear.
Night by night revealing, stares into his crystalball.
Telling tales of past and future.
When man was made and man will fall.

Welcome to the tavern in the grove.
Where ancient spirits live and rove.

The moon is rising high foreboding what the night will bring.
The crystal-ball reveals the hidden truth at the Black Hand Inn.

The priest is getting furious from the godless tales he told.
Steps right in made a cross.
Condemn the seadog and says he's bold.
John says your a liar! Long ago I was burned by priests.
See my black hand, yes I'll reveal.
That you're the devil and you're the beast!

Welcome to the tavern in the grove.
Where ancient spirits live and rove.

The moon is rising high foreboding what the night will bring.
The crystal-ball reveals the hidden truth at the Black Hand Inn.

Welcome to the tavern in the grove.
Where ancient spirits live and rove.

The moon is rising high foreboding what the night will bring.
The crystal-ball reveals the hidden truth at the Black Hand Inn.
Their power's built by lies and flying high on evil's wing.
The dark side was exposed by the old seadog at the Black Hand Inn.
