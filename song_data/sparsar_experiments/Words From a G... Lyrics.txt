Words From a G... Lyrics
by Swishahouse.

Lil' Keke.
Dedication to real street niggas man.
Ah-huh, words of a G.
Get your notepads out, y'know?
First thangs first, we internationally known.
Worldwide connected and locally accepted.
Tell you the truth man.
Some of you niggas wouldn't be shit if you was sittin in it.
It's time to put all marks in they place.
Mack or die, go hard or go home.
Shit or get off the pot gangsta.
SHEEEIT, niggas got the dick look right now, y'know?
What makes you laugh makes you cry.
Y'know you gotta be politckin in theese streets to qualify.
Niggas crumblin every time they open they motherfuckin mouth.
But y'know, we gon' sit back and do what we do.
Swishahouse, gettin money, stay true.
FOOL~!
