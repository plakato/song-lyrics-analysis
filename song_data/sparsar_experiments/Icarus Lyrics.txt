Icarus Lyrics
by Bodi.


And I'm, fly flyin away.
And I, I don't know what to say.
And I'll, be home someday.
I hope you understand and stay.
And I'm, fly flyin away.
And I, I don't know what to say.
And I'll, be home someday.
I hope you understand my ways.

So I start to pack my bags and she's begging me to stay around.
But, how you gonna keep a rocket on the ground?
Speed of sound I'm movin, leave this town superhuman.
Dreaming snoozing, breathing losing.
, cruising like a missile movin'.
Til I - reach the summit, and start to catch my breath.
A part of me's depressed, I ain't on to the next.
Steps to the door of the double wide, my troubled eyes.
She catch, and says, you only hit the road to run and hide.
How you think I feel, bed half-freezing.
Half the time you're here, then you're thinking of leaving.
Coulda kept the kid, made you stay at home.
But didn't have the means alone to raise her on my own.
Just go - know I've always been beside you.
You're the one that chose to leave me behind you.
Death is what you chase, life is the race.
Rocketman, hope you know it's lonely out in space…

Yeah, I tell her to stop her crying.
It's like she's on another plane where I'm not the pilot.
Must I remind you this is love it ain't rocket science.
But it's just as complicated and hard to digest, reason why I'm stressed.
Sitting here alone.
All she wanna hear is I'm home, instead it's my iPhone.
Even when we're together we're on different time zones.
She keeps my mind spinning like a cyclone.
While I'm gone she replied why don't I bring her along.
Or put a ring on her arm, time to ring the alarm.
When she think I'm out chasing skirts.
I'm stressing out, gaining clout, trying to shake this Earth.
Besides the fact I'll be gone til September.
Taking off by December.
She gon' need a nigga to keep her warm for the Winter.
And me, I'll be packing my luggage for another day.
Out of space baby, please don't give my love away.

Ok. Ok-k-k-k.
Cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
And this little boy grew to a man on the moon.
Sooner than I know I'm back home from the road.
Stole a part out my soul so it's easy come, harder go.
Put the key inside the lock.
But it's not really working, turn it counter to clock.
Is this the right spot? Knock a couple times.
Some dude opens up that I don't recognize, “Hi.
Who the fuck are you, what you doin in my house?
He says, You hit the road and your girl got a spouse..
Sock him in the mouth, barrel through the door.
My new ex comes in, her boy on the floor.
She says, You couldn't do it and you knew it all along.
When I needed you, you were ghost and gone.
I tell her, never again she whispers, you're wrong.
Do what you do and put your message in a song…
