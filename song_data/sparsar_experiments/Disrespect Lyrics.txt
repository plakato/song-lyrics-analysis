Disrespect Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


I don't take no disrespect.
Nigga don't try my set.
Nigga don't try my set.
Nigga don't try my set.

I don't take no disrespect.
Nigga don't try my set.
All my niggas gon' wet.
All my niggas be vets.

Bitch, I'm from a fucking state where niggas die like.
The murder rate, in this state, stay high like.
You could die in the store, or in the parking lot.
In the shitty ass weather where it stay hot.
Everybody hate life cause they ain't rich.
Robbing out of town niggas cause they flexing shit.
The only time these fucking hoes gonna be on your dick.
Is when you riding in a Benz on some fly shit.
Fuck these stupid ass hoes, cause they ain't shit.
They get killed here too, cause they suck dick.
You see the yankees in they zones running, fucking shit.
And them dreads always busting good bitch.
But I'm a Yank, so you know I'mma rep this shit.
With my American flag, flexing on your bitch.
You better keep your eyes open, in this Florida shit.
This shit hell man, these niggas here will shoot you bitch.

I don't take no disrespect.
Cause all my niggas gon wet.
We in this bitch, you know we deep, and all my niggas be vets.
Man, all my niggas grip tecs.
Fuck hoes in they.
Don't take no disrespect, we be wilding on the set.
We smoking on the best, you can feel it in your chest.
And your girl she see a vet, but I only want the neck.
Big dog status, and you boys is at the vet.
See me walk up on a nigga, put the banger to his chest.
Then I fade off in the night, hella geeking with your wife.
I'm the smoothie king, nigga, mix the lean with the sprite.
Red beam, rubber grip.
Hitting everything in sight.
Red beam, rubber grip.
Hitting everything in sight.
