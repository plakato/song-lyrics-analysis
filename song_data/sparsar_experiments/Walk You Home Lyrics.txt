Walk You Home Lyrics
by Rusty.

Life is lonely with a bounty on your head.
Your all alone, you watch your back.
Life is lonely with a bounty on your head.
You walk alone, I'll watch your back.
I smell your fear from many miles away.
I know your fear, I'm here to help.
I sit alone and think of all the things you do.
Your not with me, I'm by myself.
I'm always home, I'm always waiting for your call.
I'll walk you home.
Your steps they quicken when you know that I am there.
I feel your fear, it breaks my heart.
Please don't run, I mean you very little harm.
You walk with him, it breaks my heart.
I'm always home, I'm always waiting for your call.
I'll walk you home.
