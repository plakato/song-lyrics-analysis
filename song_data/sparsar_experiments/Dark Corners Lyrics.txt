Dark Corners Lyrics
by Akala.


Thanks to the revolutionary, great victim.
Find them accident.
Drug addicted politician.
Whatever I was self, a wordy a definition.

Some characterize it as the judgement of the sinners.
Always spiritualizing.
And they say there is no difference.
Energy ain't created or destroyed if this changes form.
Once we play the songs.
The sound just travels on.

Dark corners.
The dark corners are the place.
Where we look death in the faces.
And we let it give us chase.
But it always gets away.
Dark corners are the place.
When we running our alarms.
And we cannot back it up.
Death always catches up.

As the needles plunge into the vein.
My blood was exchange.
For those underground.
Afghan something was strange.
This time the substance, the injected was pure.
Everything you yapping for been, cut never raw, like all users.
They use to make the pain disappear.
And it was the only time my life, my mind felt so clear.
He had struggling with a sickness ever since 14.
When he remembered the hand that touched him finally understood what it means.
Off the evil, on the struggle.
Finally got clean.
And met a girl.
That made it worth pursuing his dreams.
They had plans to start a family.
With a wedding in June.
He didn't know he was so conventional.
But ye it was true.
So when the news came about Michelle, he just lost it.
Ran straight back to the same block where he use to cop it.
His old connect came up in the road, new supplier.
Brave much higher.
When he hit straight fire.
His whole body went into shock.
And fell asleep.
His brains forget to tell the lungs that they needed to breathe.
Dark corners.
Now he's in the dark corners.
When we hit them dark corners.
Can't see.
But dark corners.
A good girl, a normal girl that was everybody's view.
And though this annoyed her.
She couldn't denied it, it was true.
Whatever convention it was.
She was in it.
Grow up with both parents.
Nice house in the states.
Though, the ain't never be rich.
That something they did prosper.
Parents from Nigeria.
Both of them doctors.
Church every sunday.
She ain't never missed a week.
Everest school she was top of the class.
Ye they demanded better.

Studying law.
But had strange dreams of justice and helping the poor.
Maybe that's part of why she chose him.
Didn't know what in her mind.
But he was clever.
I'm a kind of nigga who is troubled inside.
Her parents wanted for her a nice young looking boy.
So when they found that he was english.
They were slightly annoyed.
But when they found out he was addicted to drugs.
It was two people.
Say they wouldn't come to the wedding.
It was totally shameful.
Michelle left the house in the storm.
It was a rainy night.
She never saw the truck before it ended her life.
Her parents had decided that they would apologise.
But they never got the chance in the end.
We live on borrowed time.
When dark corners come.
No, cannot run.
No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that's right.
When them dark corners come.
No, cannot run.
No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that's right.
Dark corners.

Calling all money ye.
Going to wealth.
But how well did he play with the cards that were dealt.
In his life with himself.
Triple the family coffins.
Even his father was slightly jealous.
Of what he accomplished.
Became an icon.
Products that can't resembles his age.
Each time it was released.
Should have seen him with a craze.
The was an innovator.
The great creator.
But beneath all the shine and the sheen.
Was a slave labour.
And of course, there was that was that we're fighting.
To keep, the man that was throwing from the acapella public.
When they throw back those release.
All that come back is scrutiny.
The scientist to offer the report disappeared.
Message is clear, as power is old.
It's blood.
Now wish to show you.
In which powerful grows.
Power changes reality.
And this CEO.
Had a off leverage with the media only painted him as gold.
But despite all the wealth and the things that he owned.
On his deathbed.
He couldn't find comfort for his soul.
All he could see is images of death reaching him.
Viictims of mercenaries that this government betrayed.
Fighted the cold sweat.
Colours changed.
Billions couldn't find him another day, another pain.
Dark corners.
