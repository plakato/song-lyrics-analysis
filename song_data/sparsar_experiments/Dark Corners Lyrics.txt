Dark Corners Lyrics
by Akala.


Thanks to the revolutionary great victim, 
Find them accident, 
Drug addicted politician 
Whatever. I was self a wordy a definition. 

Some characterize it as the judgement of the sinners, 
Always spiritualizing 
And. They say there is no difference: 
Energy ain't created or destroyed. If this changes form 
Once. We play the songs, 
The sound, just travels on 
 
Dark corners, 
The, dark corners are the place 
Where. We look death in the faces. 
And we let it give us chase 
But, it always gets away. 
Dark corners are the place 
When we running our alarms, 
And. We cannot back it up. 
Death, always catches up, 
 
As, the needles plunge into the vein. 
My blood was exchange 
For, those underground 
Afghan. Something was strange, 
This time the substance the injected was pure 
Everything, you yapping for been cut, never raw, like all users, 
They use to make the pain disappear. 
And. It was the only time my life, my mind, felt so clear. 
He had struggling with a sickness ever since 14 
When. He remembered the hand that touched him finally understood what it means. 
Off the evil on the struggle 
Finally got clean, 
And met a girl 
That made it worth pursuing his dreams. 
They had plans to start a family 
With a wedding in June. 
He didn't know he was so conventional 
But ye. It was true 
So. When the news came about Michelle. He just lost it 
Ran straight back to the same block where he use to cop it. 
His old connect came up in the road new supplier 
Brave much higher 
When. He hit straight fire 
His whole body went into shock, 
And fell, asleep, 
His brains forget to tell the lungs that they needed to breathe 
Dark corners, 
Now he's in the dark corners 
When. We hit them dark corners, 
Can't, see 
But, dark corners, 
A, good girl, a normal girl. That was everybody's view. 
And, though this annoyed her 
She couldn't denied it. It was true 
Whatever convention it was 
She, was in it 
Grow up with both parents, 
Nice house, in the states 
Though the ain't never be rich 
That, something they did prosper. 
Parents from Nigeria, 
Both of them doctors, 
Church every sunday. 
She ain't never missed a week. 
Everest school she was top of the class 
Ye, they demanded better 

Studying law, 
But had strange dreams of justice and helping the poor 
Maybe. That'S part of why she chose him. 
Didn'T know what in her mind, 
But. He was clever 
I'm, a kind of nigga who is troubled inside 
Her parents wanted for her a nice young, looking boy 
So when they found that he was english. 
They were slightly annoyed 
But when they found out. He was addicted to drugs. 
It was two people 
Say. They wouldn't come to the wedding. 
It was totally shameful. 
Michelle left the house in the storm. 
It was a rainy night. 
She never saw the truck before it ended her life 
Her parents had decided that they would apologise 
But they never got the chance in the end. 
We live on borrowed time, 
When dark corners, come 
No, cannot run 
No longer. Shall your skin bathe in the sun? That'S right, 
When them dark corners. Come 
No cannot run 
No longer. Shall your skin bathe in the sun? That'S right: 
Dark corners, 
, 
Calling, all money, ye 
Going to wealth 
But. How well did he play with the cards that were dealt 
In, his life with himself 
Triple, the family coffins 
Even. His father was slightly jealous 
Of. What he accomplished, 
Became, an icon 
Products that can't resembles his age 
Each time it was released. 
Should have seen him with a craze. 
The was an innovator, 
The great creator, 
But beneath all the shine and the sheen 
Was a slave labour 
And. Of course there was that was that we're fighting 
To keep the man that was throwing from the acapella public 
When they throw back those release. 
All that come back is scrutiny. 
The scientist to offer the report disappeared. 
Message is clear: as power is old, 
It's blood 
Now wish to show you 
In, which powerful grows. 
Power changes reality 
And this CEO 
Had, a off leverage with the media only painted him as gold 
But. Despite all the wealth and the things that he owned, 
On, his deathbed 
He couldn't find comfort for his soul. 
All he could see. Is images of death reaching him 
Viictims of mercenaries, that this government betrayed 
Fighted the cold, sweat 
Colours, changed 
Billions couldn't find him another day. Another pain, 
Dark corners, 
,
