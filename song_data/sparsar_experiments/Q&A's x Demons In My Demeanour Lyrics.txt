Q&A's x Demons In My Demeanour Lyrics
by Twitch.

Morgan Freeman Skit 
 
It's, the Young Prodigy 
Aka Young Prophet 
Aka suck my dick.. 
 
*laughs* 
 
Rather be lonely 
If. It was cool to be phoney 
Yet. Still you don't ever phone me 
But fuck that shit'cos, you know me 
My demons eating me wholly 
And. I can't deal with it solely 
They, told me just the smoke, the pain away, 
I just think that they sold me 
We run the jungle, the Kony, 
My, 90s babies, so Sony 
All, my working niggas, don't to speak the pepperoni 
That's just some behaviour. My people have always showed me 
Ain't a gang banging nigga. My true colours, my only 
 
Boy. I wish for omission from these evil conditions, 
You, pray for change and think you helped just'cos. You signed the petition 
You niggas trippin' 
Abiding by some shit. You don't believe in 
Until I get my paper up then I'll be leavin' 
Staring in the face of manhood 
I, never planned good. 
And time. Don'T stop so I handle it as a man should 
 
Save my place while I say my grace 
'Cos. If I make it, I know that I probably saved my face: 
 
Break, 
 
I, probably saved my face. 
 
 Got ta, say my grace 
'Cos. If I make it, I know that I probably saved my face: 
 
You're now listening to ... 
The, motherfuckin', future 
, 
*laughs* 
 
Lost in the matrix 
Not content with the basics. 
But. Still we keep the basis. 
I ain't fond of new faces 
All my niggas chasers 
Said, our dreams were audacious. 
But still, I see a future where all of us eating gracious 
Life put us through paces. 
A couple colleagues be some undercover racists 
What. If this weren't my day shift 
 
They'd, probably be up in the jury, with their face stiff 
Picture, that noose around my neck and watch'em say: lift 
 
This, just some issues that be picking my mind, 
And. It'S just adding to the fact I'm getting sick of this grind: 
Worried'bout war. When? U ignore the bomb? That'S ticking is time. 
I smoke, a cannon, kick a rhyme 
Fuck world terror. I'M fine 
She hit the blunt. Now she divine 
Body soul and her mind 
Now. We can really intertwine 
Girl them. Stars are aligned 
I'm into purp, not red wine 
But. Some chocolate is fine. 
The boy is one of a kind 
Tell'em get in the line. 
 
They all impressed and I'll be honest. I'M tryin' 
And. If I said it wasn't hard, I'd be lyin', 
I lack inspiration. Recent times I gone cold 
So I got on my Hip-Hop shit did I know 
Put my mind into drive, 
Made a stop. Now its go 
Traffic jam towards freedom, 
Also known as the doe 
Niggas. Don'T work for the council, but out here shovelling snow 
Cos. Only few can adapt just how they want it to flow. Oh 
, 
And. That'S word. That'S word: 
Murder 
For, my 90's niggas
