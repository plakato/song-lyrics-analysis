Q&A's x Demons In My Demeanour Lyrics
by Twitch.

Morgan Freeman Skit.

It's the Young Prodigy.
Aka, Young Prophet.
Aka, suck my dick...

*laughs*.

Rather be lonely.
If it was cool to be phoney.
Yet still you don't ever phone me.
But fuck that shit 'cos you know me.
My demons eating me wholly.
And I can't deal with it solely.
They told me just the smoke the pain away.
I just think that they sold me.
We run the jungle the Kony.
My 90s babies so Sony.
All my working niggas don't to speak the pepperoni.
That's just some behaviour my people have always showed me.
Ain't a gang banging nigga, my true colours my only.

Boy I, wish for omission from these evil conditions.
You pray for change and think you helped just 'cos you signed the petition.
You niggas trippin'.
Abiding by some shit you don't believe in.
Until I get my paper up then I'll be leavin'.
Staring in the face of manhood.
I never planned good.
And time don't stop so I handle it as a man should.

Save my place while I say my grace.
'Cos if I make it I know that I probably saved my face.

Break.

I probably saved my face.

Gotta say my grace.
'Cos if I make it I know that I probably saved my face.

You're now listening to....
The motherfuckin' future.

*laughs*.

Lost in the matrix.
Not content with the basics.
But still we keep the basis.
I ain't fond of new faces.
All my niggas chasers.
Said our dreams were audacious.
But still I see a future where all of us eating gracious.
Life put us through paces.
A couple colleagues be some undercover racists.
What if this weren't my day shift?

They'd probably be up in the jury with their face stiff.
Picture that noose around my neck and watch 'em say lift.

This just some issues that be picking my mind.
And it's just adding to the fact I'm getting sick of this grind.
Worried 'bout war when u ignore the bomb that's ticking is time.
I smoke a cannon, kick a rhyme.
Fuck world terror I'm fine.
She hit the blunt now she divine.
Body, soul and her mind.
Now we can really intertwine.
Girl them stars are aligned.
I'm into purp not red wine.
But some chocolate is fine.
The boy is, one of a kind.
Tell 'em get in the line.

They all impressed and I'll be honest I'm tryin'.
And, If I said it wasn't hard I'd be lyin'.
I, lack inspiration, recent times I gone cold.
So I, got on my Hip-Hop shit did I know.
Put my mind into drive.
Made a stop now its go.
Traffic jam towards freedom.
Also known as the doe.
Niggas don't work for the council but out here shovelling snow.
Cos only few can adapt, just how they want it to flow, oh.

And that's word, that's word.
Murder.
For my 90's niggas.
