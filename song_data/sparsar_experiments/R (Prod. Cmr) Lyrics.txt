R (Prod. Cmr) Lyrics
by Wormzz.


This them.
Flow chronicles.
Death defying abominable.
Bombing on motherfuckas.
Bringin' more change than Obama knows.
Boutta go kill em' and fill em' with pellets Cause I got the adrenaline to finish you can't help it.
You better off taking selfies.
When it comes to the game.
I'm a little bit too selfish.
Up writing because I'm restless and reckless.
Spitting hectic.
Poison within your septic.
Tank of your brain's infected.
Injected you've been dissected.
Your lyrics have been deflected.
My style you try to reflect it but I am just too eclectic.
Never gonna recede.
I'm never gonna retreat.
These goals I gotta complete.
Dreams that I gotta reach.
Accomplishing through these beats.
I got to be the best you've ever seen.
Making these hater green.
They envious of the steez.
I'm buzzin' just like them bees.
And ticking you off like fleas.
You haters get on your knees.
Suck my dick before I slap you with it.
Geez.

I always Keep it Real.
Cause people love the real me.
People love the real me.
People love the real me.

I'm spitting fire.
Refer to me as your sire.
She says my taste is acquired.
In need of me she's in dire.
My crackalackin' attire.
My stacking racking empire.
Desire to be the greatest of all post and prior.
Intellectual movement and no I'll never tire.
From coast to coast I'll be flyin'.
And show to show I'm arrivin'.
Autograph's I'll be signin'.
I plan to be hotter than Palmdale's fuckin' climate.
Any mountain I'll climb it.
Fountain of youth I found it.
Dousing you with proportionate portions of poison.
Poking pretties in pornographic poses.
A roses thorn is the dullest.
Compared to me I control this.
The dopest.
Now that I wrote this.
Catapult this.
Into your brain.
And let it seep in like a potion.
Like ocean waves.
Put you in a daze.
When you take a gaze.
Hypnosis.
Better focus.
Or you'll get extermianted like roaches.

I always keep it real.
Cuz people love the skill.
For real.
When I spit you already know that shit is ill.
I always keep it real, I always keep it real.
