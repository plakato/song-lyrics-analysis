Down in a Hole Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Bury me softly in this womb.
I give this part of me for you.
Sand rains down and here I sit.
Holding rare flowers.
In a tomb, in bloom.

Down in a hole, and I don't know if I can be saved.
See my heart, I decorate it like a grave.
You don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be.
Look at me now, a man Who won't let himself be.

Down in a hole.
Feeling so small.
Down in a hole.
Losing my soul.
I'd like to fly.
But my wings have been so denied.

Down in a hole, and they've put all the stones in their place.
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste.
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth.
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath.

Down in a hole.
Feeling so small.
Down in a hole.
Losing my soul.
I'd like to fly.
But my wings have been so denied.

Bury me softly in this womb.

I give this part of me for you.

Sand rains down and here I sit.
Holding rare flowers.

In a tomb.

Down in a hole.
Feeling so small.
Down in a hole.
Losing my soul.
Down in a hole.
Feeling so small.
Down in a hole.
Out of control.
I'd like to fly.
But my wings have been so denied.
