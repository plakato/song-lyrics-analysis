Summer out in Cali Lyrics
by Wordsplayed.


Yup yeah 
West west west 
Cali, Cali, Cali, 
, 
It's, Clowntown, still 100 miles and running 
There's white folk that still cross the street when we coming 
And all them. Girls that I liked was in relationships 
I'm on the phone with Beleaf tryna, get tips 
Bounce. When that bass hits summer out in Cali, 
Things was lookin' dark like that Luther King rally, 
See ,'Crae won that Grammy and they say he'lluminati 
Ya did him like Ricky when they hit him with the shotty 
 
I spent the summer out in Cali 
I spent the Summer out in Cali, 
I spent the summer out in Cali 
I spent the summer out in Cali Cali 
 
Now, I'm skatin' downtown, seen the tribe crash, the party 
In, the wild wild west, where they legalize the 
Vince said they got me and my God is still Champ 
But this heart tryna be a light up in that gas lamp 
Now. I hit that I-5 in that black and white drive 
And the ghetto bird flies lookin' for the homicide, 
Shawties ride or they die 
Red or blue. What'S your clan 
Taking names spread a flame 
Boys is in that hood man 
 
I spent the summer out in Cali 
I spent the summer out in Cali 
I spent the summer out in Cali 
I spent the summer out in Cali Cali 
 
And. Lord knows I'm missing uptown winter 
Just me the squad with the Malecon dinner. 
I thought I'd, never leave'em, 
But, God took me West and He did it for a reason. 
And summer was the season. 
So long live, Cali 
Bree got engaged and I said what up to Gawvi 
That boy about to marry, 
I done picked out a suit and sunshades 

I spent the summer out in Cali 
I spent the summer out in Cali 
I spent the summer out in Cali. 
I spent the summer out in Cali Cali
