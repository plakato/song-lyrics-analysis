16 Missed Calls Lyrics
by ViZion.


You call me, yesterday.
I call you all skies grey.
Now you left and gone away.
Raindrops like tears, and they fall from my face.
I'm too big, maybe too strong.
Too right, but I know I'm all wrong.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
But if I see you cry, I'd feel alright.
So let me play you, and let me break you.
Let me make you, just like me.
Let me love you, and let me hate you.
Don't let me take you down with me.

16 missed calls.
And a head full'a alcohol.
And my bed spinning off the walls.
I'm about to break it off.
I called she, pressed ignore.
So I got another girl at my door.
Life's a bitch who made me insecure.
So I'm killing love.
Yea im killing love.
Im'a break it off.
Assassinating love.

I went a whole day waiting on a phone call.
Cause we fought the night before.
When I gave up on the tug-a-war and I called.
Your phone was off.
I know this game, yea I've played it many times.
Karma got me paying for my many crimes.
But I'm going insane, out my mind.
And getting faded, like colours in the summer time.
Ego got me king kong strong.
Johnny Walker talking to me, telling me keep walking on.
Every step ticking like a bomb and I'm swaying.
I'm killin' love in the club like amen.

16 missed calls.
And a head full'a alcohol.
And my bed spinning off the walls.
I'm about to break it off.
I called, she pressed ignore.
So I got another girl at my door.
Life's a bitch who made me insecure.
So I'm killing love.
Yea im killing love.
Im'a break it off.
Assassinating love.

The love that died in those red lights still chase me.
I'm falling down into myself, cause I hate me.
I was so wrong, and now you're gone oh baby.
I'm falling down into myself, don't save me.

It's crazy how, I made this vow.
That I love you forever never break us down.
Sitting at the table, well past the label.
I reach rock bottom but they just won't drown.
Memories of you won't die.
One quarter later, still with me in the sky.
Everywhere I go I see you and I.
Wish I could turn back the hands of time.

16 missed calls.
And a head full'a alcohol.
And my bed spinning off the walls.
I'm about to break it off.
I called she, pressed ignore.
So I got another girl at my door.
Life's a bitch who made me insecure.
So I killed the love.
Yea i killed the love.
Yea I broke it off.
Assassinated love.
