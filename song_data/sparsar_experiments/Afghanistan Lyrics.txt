Afghanistan Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Yung Leandoer.
Shawty you know what it do.
2015, MIA.
Skurtttt.

Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me.
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan.
Keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me.
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan.

Cause I keep that kush from Afghanistan, and I smoke that OG.
I'm fucked, I roll, posted up in the cold.
I'm a cannon, I'mma blow, 30 genes, I'm a bodyguard.
I'll take ya to the cold, yeah, I'mma take ya to the cold.

Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me.
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan.
Keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me.
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan.

Get glass interior, yeah I broke the barrier.
I don't want that shawty, yeah, you should go and marry her.
I'm on my cellular, we rollin' Jheri curls.
Yeah, I'm elegant for the hell of it.
Roll that shit, water it, like fish and sell that shit.
12 a bag, 12 a bitch, acne jeans, I'm on my shit.
Sewer cup, double up, James.
Bond, hit her up.
Hit 'em up, fuck my guts, I'm in it for the fuckin' lunch.
Captain Crunch, blowin' bubble gum, pitbull jaws on the hunt.
Mind off in maniac, money on my mind.
Had to leave that place, couldn't take it at the time.
Now I'm on my fuckin' grind, yeah I'm on my fuckin' grind.

Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me.
Cause keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan.
Keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me.
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan.
Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me.
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan.
Keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me.
Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan.

I'm fucked, I roll, posted up in the cold.
See I'm fucked, I roll kush from Afghanistan.
Fucked, I roll, posted up in the cold.
See I'm fucked, I roll kush from Afghanistan.
