Kid Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Girl, you can, everything we wanted.
I'm not scared, finding your love.
Come back to me darling, I'm really down.
Make time and I, too.

It's just delivered for your kid.
Keeps standing on the fire.
It's just delivered for your kid.
?
It's just delivered for your kid.
I won't let you fall back down.
It's not that easy for a kid.

The time is now, oh I wanna hold you.
You'll get right, when it's wrong.
Just come back to me darling, don't let me down.
If you could look me in the eyes, you'd know.

It's just delivered for your kid.
To play behind the one and only.
It's just delivered for your kid.
To run away, yeah.
It's just delivered for your kid.
I won't let you break your back now.
It's not that easy for a kid.

I won't let you break your back now.
It's not that easy for a kid.
