Sweet Summer Rain Lyrics
by Rushlow.

Three or four miles down a red dirt road.
Lived a green-eyed girl, I used to go to see her.
I'd pull up the drive and she'd jump in.
And we'd head off down around the bend to the river.

Find a perfect spot and throw a blanket on the ground.
Sit there talkin' till the sun went down, about nothing.
Then one hot day in June, the clouds rolled in right out of the blue.
As we ran for cover, I could smell her perfume and that.

Sweet.

Sweet summer rain.

Oh, that sweet.

Sweet summer rain.

We were jumpin' and runnin' and laughin' out loud.
The sky opened up like the bottom fell out of Heaven, yeah.
We dove in the car, turned the radio on.
Sat there soakin', singing along with Elton, Bennie and the Jets.

She turned and looked my way.
Those raindrops slowly runnin' down on her face.
I reached out and kissed her.
Well, I remember that taste of that.

Sweet.

Sweet summer rain.

Oh, that sweet.

Sweet summer rain.

Sweet summer rain.
It keeps blowin' through my mind.
Even after all this time.
I can't forget that moment, yeah we were falling just like that.

Sweet.

Sweet summer rain.

Yeah, that sweet.

Sweet summer rain.

Oh that sweet.

Sweet summer rain.

Yeah, that sweet.

Sweet summer rain.

I still remember.
Sweet rain fallin' down on us.
