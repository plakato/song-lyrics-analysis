Ex Calling Lyrics
by 6lack.


Scrolling through these mother fucking texts.
They ain't say nothing but the same shit.
Put that shit on do not disturb.
Bitch I'm in the studio.
Three in the morning I'm on do not disturb.
My last little fling I put that shit in the dirt.
Pop out the car screamin'.

I can hear my ex calling.
Don't know why my ex calling.
Why the fuck my ex calling.
Don't know why my ex calling.
I can see my ex calling.
Hold up why my ex calling.
Don't know why my ex calling.
Why the fuck my ex calling.

I can see my ex calling.
Oh no now my next calling.
I don't know why I stress on them.
I just want the best of them.

We been through some things yeah.
Thought I could restrain ya.
I just want to tame ya.
Impossible to change ya.
Every time I try to put the fire out it puts the flames up.
You text me like I called ya.
Well I don't mean to stall ya.
But I cannot afford ya.
So I got it in all ya.
Cause I just want to ball yeah and you just want to fall yeah.
I pick up my phone what the heck.
Coming at my neck.
Tripping via text disrespect.
I don't fuck with that.
Can't put me in check.
You the ex calling for the sex.
Want me cause I'm next.
I'm the future where the Percocets.

I can see my ex calling.
Oh no now my next calling.
I don't know why I stress on them.
I just want the best of them.

There's something wrong with my hand.
Can't pick up the phone got it down hope you understand.
I came how you forgot the drinks.
And if you gotta choose then you better choose the other man.
See I wait out that good side and that bad side so I'm done.
I broke it down it was crunch time got focused and we won.
Your favorite rapper gon want to join it the dream team and we come.
Don't do this shit just for fun.
Do this shit just to run.
Run it back like a blunt.
Run that shit like Chris Breezy.
All these hoes is on me.
All these sights on me.
All these lights on me.
Not really like to stay lowkey but still all that vice is on me.
Never been by the bird talk.
To me that's that absurd talk.
Always been by the splurge talk.
That when we used to bird walk.
And knocked off from my course man that one time and I swear.
I never wanna go there.
That's unless she got nice brown skin good credit man and long hair.

I can see my ex calling.
Oh no now my next calling.
I don't know why I stress on them.
I just want the best of them.

I can hear my ex calling.
Don't know why my ex calling.
Why the fuck my ex calling.
Don't know why my ex calling.
I can see my ex calling.
Hold up why my ex calling.
Don't know why my ex calling.
Why the fuck my ex calling.
