Peach Moon Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

And.
I don't know why.
The moon played such a cruel trick on the tide.
They're at the heaven of life.
Until the moon explodes.
Until the sea dries up.

I don't know why.
The moon played such a cruel trick on the bride.
They're at the heaven of life.
Until the moon explodes.
Will the sea dry up?

Sun smudged peach moon.
Softer than.
An icecream cone in June.

And I don't know why.
Lightning strikes so perfectly at.
Night x8.

Yeah.

All my life I've been waiting for.
A sign to say move on.
And tonight.
All the salt that's in the air feels right.
Right x8.

Moon, moon.
With your skin so rough.
Makes you look so tough.
Deflect an asteroid for us.

Poor moon no one looks up to you.
Your streak? is through.
You're a blind spot.
Like the.

Sun smudged peach moon.
Softer than.
An icecream cone in June.

And I don't know why.
Thunder purrs so strikingly at night.
