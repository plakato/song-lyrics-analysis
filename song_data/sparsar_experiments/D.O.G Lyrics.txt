D.O.G Lyrics
by Wonder Broz.


Get your stop watches ready, cause this is the Countdown 5 Mixtape.
With DJ Carisma, and the Wonder Broz.

Code name.
I got heavy on the beat, I do my own thang.
I ain't scary, no indeed I rep my own game.
Chickens want beef well we want the same thing.
Boy bring it out.
What's a dog to a wolf.
What's a cat to a lion.
What's a fish to a shark.
Lemme think, all talk.
Walk the walk, prove me wrong.
Put it on the beat, this song.
Cause this song, is a diss song.
To all you wanna be rappers, come on.
Cause this song, is a diss song.
To all you wanna be rappers, come on.
Cause this song, is a diss song.
To all you wanna be rappers, come on.
For Real though, I'm being real bro.
Too many non writing, and reciting weirdos.
Shout Out Fly Kid, Shout Out Young Sam.
Shout Out J and Fresh, Shout Out To Ranger Gang.
Real niggas feel me.
Sticks and stones break bones, but y'all flow kill me.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Y'all know G, I'm For real 'bout mine.
Golden boy with the flow, I take it serious each line.
All the time when I rhyme, I go left on the beat.
I'm right handed if you google that, you'll know what I mean.
Five steps ahead of you, after this add three.
Which makes me two steps away from the tops in the industry.
In the end I'll be, indefinitely.
The best to ever do it, for infinity.
No son of a gun, I'm a son of a G.
Built tough, raised rough, nigga test me.
Address me, if you got a problem.
If you tripping I ain't tripping, I know how to solve it.
Stall it, ink first.
Jump to conclusions that's how niggas end up getting hurt.
I punch the clock I work overtime.
Niggas wanna gather 'em up, I show 'em a punch line.
