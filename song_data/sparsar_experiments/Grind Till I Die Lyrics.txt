Grind Till I Die Lyrics
by 5th Child.


You know who it is man.
It's the boy 3rd Shift a Cincinnati monster.
Mr. Shit-on-your-favorite-producer.
My model for the oh eight is no sleep.
My man 5th about to get them and my man G-Eazy is about to split them.

Ho, I run this and I don't give a care about your flare or the dough or the.
team that you run with.
â€˜Cause I've been on a roll since I made my first hundred.
Anybody standing in my road to riches is getting done with.
Fiending for the green, addicted to the skrilla.
Since the lady with the wings put a quarter on my pillow.
5th'll do to beats what fat kids do to sweets.
What you're doing on a mixtape, I'm doing in the streets.
Yessir, playing for keeps, dawg I'm sonning cats, running rap.
Never seen defeat like my stomach's fat, run it back.
Gotta keep it southern, I am from the Jack.
Brothas in the club chase a freak that can make her cheeks thunderclap.
Proceed with caution or sleep in a coffin.
I'm a walkin' BOLO BOLO when it comes to this nonsense yep.
Peaceful often. Rap beef is not an option.
Unless niggas heads is blown up. Then we can get it poppin'.

Whoever said I ain't the realest must be autistic, that's ridiculous.
I got bar style artistic and meticulous.
I'm living this game on my back and 3rd Shift with us.
We got an epidemic washing tip like syphilis.
The team here this time there's no stopping me.
To say he's next in line is quite possibly.
In fact more of a prophesy.
If you ain't getting dough well then go rhyme harder is my philosophy.
I'm taking shits on rappers making a mockery.
It's unavoidable I'm next it's no democracy.
How you own three chains and no property.
Homie you eating sloppily, I feast properly.
I probably get charged with armed robbery.
Pistols to the rap game.
Come out of everything that you got for me.
You can try there's no stopping me.
I'mma rhyme till it's a casket and six feet of dirt on top of me.
G-Eazy.

That's right nigga that's right nigga.
Till the casket is on top of me baby.
For ? I'm going real hard.
Like my man ? said real hard in these bitch ass niggas.
No sleep, I sleep when I'm dead.
And until then I'm on the grind hustling.
Trying to get it ? baby.
From the N-O to Cincinnati and to the bank to the D and everything in between.
My bad 5th can't forget about Jackson.
? 3rd Shift 2008 baby.
Cincinnati monster.
You know what, I'm changing my shit this year.
Instead of Cincinnati monster, I'm Mr. Take-a-shit-on-your-favorite-producer.
? and if not its a motherfucking crime, a felony and tear stains.
?
3rd Shift.
