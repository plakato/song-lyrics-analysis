Head Turner Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Come on mayn huuuh, head turner.
Geah feel it, I turn motherfucking heads.
When I walk in, I don't know about you.

Swisha sweet burner, big face earner.
Boy I's, a fucking head turner.

Big Pluck.
Swinging in the Benz, swinging through the lot.
Fo' niggas in the back, bout to punch the roof out.
Getting crunk then thoed, Nobody through the do'.
Big Pluck I represent it, bitch you already know.
Niggas get mad, and wanna knock me like a do'.
Nigga don't get mad, cause a fat nigga took your hoe.
She's not your dame though, she's your main hoe.
I chunked the deuce, and took your bitch to Shanango.
Bitch turn your head, when you see a head turner.
I got your bitch deep throating, sucking she's a head turner.
So I'ma go ahead and turn her, into a freak a head hunter.
I got her neck her hair done on my nuts, and my bed's gonna.
Break soon like boom, I got my camera on zoom.
Don't disturb me I'm in my room, Yung Ro coming soon.

Yung Ro.
Here I am the one and only, pimptastic with tenderonies.
Got em regretting what they did, compared to how long they know me my homie.
See you can't clone me, you only wanna cut she lonely.
I fuck her tell her to phone me, then fuck em my number's phony.
But if I tell her to turn her head, and I get a light turn up.
I'm subject to might turn up, and flip into Ike Turner.
I'm a head turner, big faces counting these heads turning.
Now these boppers heads turning, smiling at me my head turning.
Head burning chest burning, cause I'm feeling this X.
Bitches looking for me in a Lac, but I'm still in a Lex.
I'm still with the Flex, D. Black, B. Booker ain't late.
We reminiscing and listening, to karaoke tapes.
Life is great I thank the Lord, when I get out my bed.
Even hoes who don't know me, curious could I turn so many heads.
Like who is he Yung Ro, oh that dude that rhyme tight.

baby.

Sipp.
I'm a head turner, because these hoes love the whip.
My game's a overdose, and that's why hoes love the Sipp.
And boy, I's a fly smooth talking goon sparking.
These bops flock, when they see me in the Platoon parking.
They see the car and think MJ, that's just the shoes talking.
I'm on 23's, but look like the rims is moon walking.
My car's a tomboy, bitch she wears skirts and shoes.
But if you touch her, man I'ma have to hurt you dudes.
Look how they stare and shit, this is what I gotta bare with.
She kissing on me, damn girl you fucking up my velvet.
But she's on this one man thang, but can't get one man brain.
But she know that I can fuck, like a one man train.
I know you going hard on me, want my dicks and air.
But your job is done ma, now go fix your hair.
This is for my thugs, who let they bumper drag down the break.
You ain't got no candy on your car, that's a flag on the plate.

L. Dogg.
Well I jump out the six grinning, hating niggas can't stand it.
I'm in a car that look like something, that came from a different planet.
I got a jet, that gets me to L.A. in twelve minutes.
And I'm young but got money, long as a rapist jail sentence.
You can call me the hardest, the rap game land lord.
Them boys rapping bout Jags, but driving '92 Fords.
And I'm the head turning, y'all boys ain't messing with me.
I'm getting Paid In Full, y'all making cents like 50.
And I dare y'all to label me, as a commercial rapper.
Piss my little ass off, and I bet you I hurt a rapper.
Shotgun in the trunk, 22 under the seat.
And Sprewells on the Benz, 22's under the Jeep.
And I'm the rawest nigga rapping, on these underground tapes.
I'm trying to handle more weight, and put candles on a cake.
And I turn heads, with the big heads I earn.
Just call me neck and shoulders, cause I'm the reason heads turn.
