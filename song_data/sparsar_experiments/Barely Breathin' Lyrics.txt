Barely Breathin' Lyrics
by Vixen.

I keep reading all that graffiti on your back.
You brush over it but the paint begins to blister and crack.
Well, I can see that she forgot to cross a T, an oversight.
Why don't you just tell her to finish what she's started.
And get it right.
My script has a lighter touch.
She leaves an impression.
And when you find her a bit too much.
I'm not your concession.

Refrain:.
Well, there are things you can't undo.
Although your conscience needs you to.
And if there's decency in you.
It's barely breathin'.

This is not your typical dysfunctional mess.
Cause not once ounce of guilt is coming over you.
You won't confess.
But your essance reeks of her.
She's in my bed.
And your speech is well rehearsed.
It's not in my head.

-Refrain-.
