Barely Breathin' Lyrics
by Vixen.

I keep reading all that graffiti on your back 
You brush over it, but the paint begins to blister and crack 
Well. I can see that she forgot to cross a T, an oversight 
Why. Don'T you just tell her to finish what she's started? 
And get it right. 
My script has a lighter touch. 
She leaves an impression 
And when you find her a bit too much 
I'm, not your concession, 
 
Refrain 
Well. There are things you can't undo 
Although. Your conscience needs you to 
And. If there's decency in you 
It's, barely breathin' 
 
This is not your typical dysfunctional mess. 
Cause not once ounce of guilt is coming over. You 
You won't confess 
But, your essance reeks of her 
She's in my bed 
And. Your speech is well rehearsed, 
It's, not in my head, 
 
-Refrain-
