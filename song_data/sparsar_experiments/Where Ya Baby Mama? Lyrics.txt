Little kid talking.

5th Ward Weebie.
Ho, ah ha ha.

Ya baby mama in the club and ya know she actin' bad.
She's a ho, she's a ho.
Ya baby daddy in the club and ya know he actin' bad.
He's a ho, he's a ho.
Ya baby mama actin' bad in this bitch, ha.

Ya baby mama actin' bad in this bitch, ha.
Cause she's a ho, she's a ho.

Phoolish.
Now in the club they be wantin' mo'.
To hit the mack that give em' stacks to wobble on the flo'.
That's how it go Sunday night up , rip up in the spot.
They gotta hit em' in the spot, so drop it like it's hot.
Movin' the thong, showin' pussy, let me see it shake.
And put the holla OH if they want that pussy ache.
Look what cha' made, three kids, three sperm donors.
Willin' to give that pussy up to whoever run up on her.
She in the corner actin' bad off Shake It Fast.
That Blue Hawaiian got her mind, you can take her ass.
Now picture that, yo baby daddy still wantin' mo'.
She in the club actin' bad that's why they caller ho.

5th Ward Weebie.
Man I'm chillin by the bar and I'm kickin' it with a fat ho.
Titties lookin' good but I'm really peakin' that ass though.
Feelin' on the thighs cause I'm chillin' full of that Hennessey.
After a long night of this hit, she gon' remember me.
Man what's this ho name again, oh it's Tiffany.
Two minutes before Weebie came on, she be kissin' me.
Baby mom came by the bar tryin' to be messy.
Hangin' with these stupid ass hoes lookin' all nasty.
Workin' all play it off like I don't see this ho.
Try to shake me up if ya want but I'ma beat a ho.
You a sad bitch in the club tryin to act bad.
Throwin out they child support, aught to be glad bitch.

Phoolish.
Why T, don't get mad nigga.
Hatin' on her cause she about to shake that ass nigga.
Waitin' on her tryin to catch actin' bad nigga.
Hittin' them stairs, bout to work it for that cash nigga.
You's a sad nigga.
You supposed to try to make her break that bread.
When she come home, she done break a nigga, take the bread.
I hate to say it but she leavin' here with us tonight.
Nut suckin' butt fuckin' in the truck tonight.
I'ma fuck her right, tuck her right in the corner in back of the club.
In the V.I. sippin' on yac in the club.
About three I'ma get my shit packed in the club.
And go knee high in that bitch after the club.

Various ad-libs and lines to fade.
