You're like perfection, some kind of holiday.
You got me thinking that we could run away.
You want I'll take you there.
You tell me when and where, oh-oh, oh, oh.

But then I asked for your number, said you don't have a phone.
It's getting late now, I gotta let you know.
That everybody wants to take you home tonight.
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine.

Don't stop, doing what you're doing.
Every time you move to the beat.
It gets harder for me.
And you know it, know it, know it.
And don't stop, cause you know that I like it.
Every time you walk in the room.
You got all eyes on you.
And you know it, know it, know it.

You're coming close now, swear I can taste it.
You got me tongue-tied, I can't escape it.
I'm loving what you got.
But then you push me off, oh-oh, oh, oh.

And everybody wants to take you home tonight.
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine.

Don't stop, doing what you're doing.
Every time you move to the beat.
It gets harder for me.
And you know it, know it, know it.
And don't stop, cause you know that I like it.
Every time you walk in the room.
You got all eyes on you.
And you know it, know it, know it.

Every day it's the same.
All the games that you play.
Back and forth, round and round.
Kinda like it this way.
_Don't stop, doing what you're doing.
Cause everytime you move to the beat.
It gets harder for me.
And you know it, know it, know it_.

All &amp; _Ashton_ &amp; **Michael**.
And don't stop cause you know that I like it.
Every time you walk in the room.
You got all eyes on you.
And you know it, know it, know it, know it, don't stop.
_Don't stop, stop what you're doing.
Cause you know that, you know that I like it_.
Everytime you move to the beat.
It gets harder for me.
And you know it, know it, know it.
And don't stop cause you know that I like it.
**You know that I like it**.
Every time you walk in the room, you got all eyes on you.
And you know it, know it, know it.
