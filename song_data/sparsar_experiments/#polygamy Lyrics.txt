by WordPlay T.JAY.


All, my people love it.. How are they this into me? 
Hmm -- Cause its probably where I'm finna be 
That boy on stage that the bad girls came to see, 
\ -- Call it pound. Polygamy 
Yeah, if is where you wan na, be 
Girl, grab ya girlfriend and then follow me. X2 
 
Girl. You know u. Baaaaad uh, where you sheep at 
I, mean sleep at thought. It when I peeped that 
You can tweet that got like 14 bars, 
Lets grab a drank cause. I know you parched 
TeamOTM and you know I start 
Me and a couple of my niggas bout to go real far. 
You can be my queen if you play your cards. 
I'M talking about diamonds for the queen of my heart, 
But back to the subject hanging like a mullet 
Taking things over the top like a muffin 
All, the temptation is sort of like I'm Ruffin 
If. You see that man whack then gone and Beebe Bluff him 
Where his money at Faking on his dummy act, 
Empty out my pockets.
