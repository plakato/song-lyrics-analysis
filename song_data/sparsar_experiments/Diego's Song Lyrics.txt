Diego's Song Lyrics
by 415 fossas.


The time has come for this resurrection.

Grabbed a gun to gain this erection.

The pain has become too deep.

No more pleasure from fucking those sheep.

The darkness has entrenched my soul.

A young child's virginity is what I stole.

The loss of blood has made me content.

That bitches abortion, all my money spent.

The erection has now come and gone.

All thats left, a gun for dawn.

The soul is dead, only blood to shed.

When I piss, all I see is red.

The help has passed without sorrow.

No more time for me to borrow.

The trigger pulled, now to conclude.

A lifeless body to be viewed.

He's thinking about Stevie Brock wearing nothing but a sock.

He got one hand on his cock but in the other he's got his Glock.

Sitting drunk as a cunt on his bed, wearing a top hat on his head.

His short term memory is dead and his wrists are cut and bled.

He wonders “Would I look sexy crucified?”.

He's thinking hard about committing suicide.

He points the gun at his dome but pulls away quick.

The thought of his blown out brains makes him feel intensely sick.

Sean falls asleep in bed but wakes up naked face down in a ditch.

Split personality disorder is a son of a bitch.

Diego Johnson wakes up after Sean goes to sleep and looks to get his nut.

butt.

The war between Sean and Diego Johnson finally expires.

He points the gun at his heart and he finally fires!

The heart ceases to beat, Sean is dead and gone.

But the body stands up because Diego Johnson lives on…

Unknown.

Satanic Tounges X16.
