Demoiselle Lyrics
by Antonym.

DEMOISELLE:.

Insecurities tangle you up.
Into one big mess.
Damsel in distress.
So you surround yourself by darkness.
I still don't know where your heart is.
We could find it.
You try to find it.

But even though you're all alone.
All alone when I am gone.
I know you're gonna hear this song.
I'm coming back say.

I'm coming back oh.
I said I'm coming back.
Let me figure out some things to put myself on track.
Then you could help me through the door.
Get my suitcase unpacked then we could.
Go slow.
Go slow.

Sara Laban.
Summertime sadness.
I just wanted you to know.
That baby you the best.

Antonym.
Let me ask you one thing girl could you.

Sara Laban.
Kiss me hard before you go.
Summertime sadness.

Antonym.
With a, With a.
Girl, I'm Anton Bouffard.
Mind is so twisted like the street on Lombard.
Spit hard bars, you don't even know.
I spit a flow turn you red like the Teletubbie Po!
Oh no no who are you?
Demoiselles like I found two.
Two plus one that's simple math.
I can't pick up the phone when I'm chilling in the bathtub.

Don't forget the bubbles ho.
