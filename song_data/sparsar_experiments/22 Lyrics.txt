22 Lyrics
by Yungen.


Yeah it's my birthday, I might get high tonight.
She said she's single, but she wanna be mine tonight.
Drinks on my table, I like them straight.
All I want for my birthday is some cake, cake, cake, cake.
As long as my people with me, I'm good.
As long as my people with me, I'm good.

Everybody know everybody.
Thank God I ain't anybody.
And I'll drink to that.
In the G-wagon with a tinted back.
When it pulls up, skrt.
Yeah it makes them pree.
I woke up to brain for my breakfast like shit, it sucks to be me.
I had a big booty hoe for New Years, I don't need her tonight.
As long as my mandem here, my day ones, then everything's alright.
Yeah he might have been here last year, now me and him ain't tight.
I might beat his girl just to piss him off, she ain't even my type.
Birthday vibes, catch me in the West End.
Yeah you can come in the VIP girl but you can't bring your dead friends.
Psst, about bredrins.
Racks said leave your money at home to everybody, it's on him.
Drinks on drinks, bottles on bottles.
I don't know how I got here.

Yeah it's my birthday, I might get high tonight.
She said she's single, but she wanna be mine tonight.
Drinks on my table, I like them straight.
All I want for my birthday is some cake, cake, cake, cake.
As long as my people with me, I'm good.
As long as my people with me, I'm good.

Yeah.
She said what am I doing, she wanna celebrate.
I tell her come round, put your best outfit on, don't forget the cake.
Tarted up, I just wanna penetrate.
On my Jerimih, I've got some birthday sex I wanna demonstrate.
On you, blame the occasion.
Girl how you get a back like that and your mumma.
Caucasian.
How you learn to work like that if you never go raving.
And how you gonna make me wait like we don't want the same thing.
My gift wrapped in Ann Summers but I'm a winter baby, I'm.
cold.
Last year it came Victoria Secret but I don't ever speak what I'm.
told.
I want all my people here so it's only right that you rolled.
She said why do I even buy you shit after all the dreams that you've sold.

Yeah it's my birthday, I might get high tonight.
She said she's single, but she wanna be mine tonight.
Drinks on my table, I like them straight.
All I want for my birthday is some cake, cake, cake, cake.
As long as my people with me, I'm good.
As long as my people with me, I'm good.
Yeah it's my birthday, I might get high tonight.
She said she's single, but she wanna be mine tonight.
Drinks on my table, I like them straight.
All I want for my birthday is some cake, cake, cake, cake.
As long as my people with me, I'm good.
All I want for my birthday is some cake, cake, cake, cake.
