Batalvi Lyrics
by Swetshop Boys.

Heems.
Swetshop Boys.
Batalvi.
Riz MC.
Heemy, Heemy, Heemy, Heemy.

Heemy like the Dapper Dan that's from Trapistan.
This beefsteak sauce I will slap a man.
My mullah get the moola, my mullah name Abdullah.
My Karachi posse got me if I need a shooter.
I could for my first time give you a tour my man.
Got more than fam in Lahore like damn.
Behind closed doors it's just scores and plans.
It's not my fault you're a boring man.
What's up man you smoking on that flora that fauna.
Take that off, we in the sauna.
I don't even know if she like my persona.
Maybe she just want a new gucci purse on her.
I'm from Punjub, shooters in Ludhiana.
I don't give a fuck we just put the heat on you.
They don't give a fuck when put the heat up on you.
Heemy, he don't give a fuck, but he still trying to warn you.

Riz MC.
Who's that Paki in the Guardian.
The EDL trolls wanna start with it.
Sound Punjabi on the beat with the yardie swing.
Hijabis wanna tweet him on the Shaadi thing.
Some yuppies come greet me in the bar we in.
Others hail me like a cab whatever car I'm in.
Yati's at the flat.
Mummy's at the apartment.
Gotta shrink the harem.
Go from hunting to a farmer team.
All up in the slow suicide.
To Riz a kiddie isn't rich.
Get on with Oxford certificates.
Trying to stretch culture.
Trapped in a silhouette.
Fuck's too raw, pillow talk's too literate.
Swap me a dollar for my pound of flesh.
Spilling guts and out of breath.
Lyrics all about your ex.
Now I'm on the next white vegan yogi.
She wanna be Brahmin so the brown man she bone, G.
