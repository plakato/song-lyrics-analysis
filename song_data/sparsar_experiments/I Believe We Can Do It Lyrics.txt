I Believe We Can Do It Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Sun goes down on another day.
Had one too many but I feel O.K.
Put me to bed, baby there I'll stay.
Dreamin.

Come to my bed, I'll show you my love.
Don't try to leave, I won't cry at all.
I'll hold your hand, baby I'll stand tall.
Cause I love you.

I believe in my good times.
I believe in my music.
I believe in what we can achieve.
I believe we can do it.

Show me a lover and I'll write you a song.
Say that this love is a game come on and play along.
This feels so right how can it be wrong?
It's the moment.

This feels so right how can it be wrong.
It's the moment.

2 times.
