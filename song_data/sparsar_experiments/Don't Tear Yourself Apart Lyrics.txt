Don't Tear Yourself Apart Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

When tears blind what's around.
Don't tear yourself apart.
When it all seems to bring you down.
Don't tear yourself apart.

I can promise you better ways.
We'll be living in better days.
I can see through the harder times.
We'll be living better lives.

When all those things you've found.
Can't mend your broken heart.
With all emotions drowned.
Like you're falling apart.

I can promise you better ways.
We'll be living in better days.
I can see through the harder times.
We'll be living better lives.

I can promise you better ways.
We'll be living in better days.
I can see there's a chance always.
