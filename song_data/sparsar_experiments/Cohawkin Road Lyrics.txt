Cohawkin Road Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

Hidden inside him.
Music in the dark.
This conquering kindness.
To all in his quiver.
Burdened hard.
On the road.
By law all are wounded.
That you may know.
You may know one another.
She looks for me in picture.
Oh my brother's keeper.
In picture worn smooth.
From hand to hand.
A quiet unlearning oh I had forgotten.
To control the tongue.
I do now remember.
Do not all step to the end of dreams.
Down piano wire.
They will leave the lips.
Of everyone's desire.
In the cold cold comfort.
Of winter on winter.
Swinging mood.
Swinging mood.
Quick round every turn.
Within your frame.
My sister.
They are endless three.
Yet in the mirror of the knife.
I see only me.
Do not all step to the end of dreams.
Down piano wire.
They will leave the lips.
Of everyone's desire.
