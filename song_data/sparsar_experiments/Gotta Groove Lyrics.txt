Gotta Groove Lyrics
by 4 Broz By Broz.

DJ Oatmeal.
La-Z-Boy back and enjoy.
yourself.
Cause just like soy, Oatmeal's good for your health.
Says your physician, 4 Broz 2nd edition on a mission.
4th floor office door sign says we're out fishin'.
And I spread it on thick, like grandmas canned jam.
I'm back in the saddle.
like the Son of Sam.
I am an appliance designed to drop science.
My bill paying skills is what keeps me financed.

And I cut up a rug like it's a dame and I'm Bundy.
This groove's got the back that makes you shake your tush.
Fat Bass line's thicker than George W's Bush.
Ladies on the dance floor: we know you wanted more.
We're back on the wax- and it's time settle the score.
Our funk's a work of art -and it's hanging in The Louvre.
When the patrons walk past it - you know they bust a move.

Cause I gotta, gotta gotta, gotta groove right now!

H nasty Bamboo Shoots a.k.a. Tangerines.
I'm farting out rhymes all over your face.
I'm the Rapping Detective, and I'm wrapping up this case.
If you lost your daugher, I can help you find her.
Phantom Menace puts the case files in a 3-ring binder.
There's no need to call an ambulance.
You're not covered in ants, there's no hot soup in your pants.
I'm just slamming these rhymes down hard Like Larry Nance.
When I get up on stage, you're going to stand up and dance.

Tangerines and DJ Oatmeal.
We rhyme with speed - nah, we don't fatigue.
Members of the Poetic Justice League.
Tangerines and Oatmeal got nothing left to prove.
We're a great a breakfast combo for those who got to groove.

Tangerines.
Wine and condoms - all you need at a picnic.
Let me flick you a quick tip - you can't handle this dick, kid.
You're flaccid - I cum miracles on ice like Lake Placid.
Shoot it in your eyes - it blinds like battery acid.
Oh? I got you pregnant? Well, isn't that tragic?
Take my advice and go get an abortion.
And don't you dare ask me to pay my portion.
'Caue I can't, cause I won't.
Cause 4 Broz is back at the club.
Making all the girls moist and all the guys get chubs.
Doing hip hop dances like Coach Z and Bubs.
Now stop bothering me about child support!

DJ Oatmeal.
Screams peel for Oatmeal and they always be pesterin'.
Pull a Charleston Heston,.
fire my Smith and Wesson.
And I got a round left for a lucky-feeling punk.
Shatter you like glass on a O'Neil dunk.
3 sheets to the wind, half.
mast already gone.
His partial got court martialed, twas illegal public schlong.

He got a B+ in pleasure from The the School of Hedonics.
Now it's me and Tangerines and we're on the scene and.
Gotta Move to this groove like you were bustin' a Keaton.
The Times headline's got.
the full details:.
Oatmeal fucked up the track like a penny on the rails.
