My Friend Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man.
Ooh, aw yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ooh baby, aw yeah, oh.
I never wanna see you girl my friend.

A year ago in school is where.
It all began.
I walk you to the bus stop like everyday.
And after then, we'd meet again, I'd feel OK.
It came as a surprise.
You were like one of the guys.
Going to the crew.
Then one day you came to me.

And I'm with you unhappy.
But what should I do.
How can I tell you.

3rd Storee.
1- I've been holding back so long.
Thinking what I feel is wrong.
Can't believe I feel in love.
With such a friend of mine.
You are everything to me.
It's a shame I couldn't see.
All the feelings rearranging.
Right before my eyes.

Lil'Man.
I don't wanna take the risk of losing you.
And if I have to keep it to myself.
That's what I'll do.
I get butterflies when I see you staring my way.
Writing letters to myself to think of what to say.
It's a feeling I can't hide.
It's destroying me inside.
My life is gone all week â€˜cause I can't get no sleep.
And the way I look at you.
Has got to catch the clues.
And it's all to see.
How you will respond to me.

D-Smoove.
Hey, what's up Shanelle?

Hey uh, can you keep a secret?
Cool, well uh you know Lil'Man.
Got a big crush on you and all that.
Yeah.

Oh for real, well let me go tell him then.
