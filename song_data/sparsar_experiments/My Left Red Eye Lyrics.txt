My Left Red Eye Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

He is alone again.
His left hand is dead.
The sun shines on his bed.
His left eye is red.
Walking machine with no highs.
Programmed for constant lows.
He turns the walk mode on.
This robot has got the blues.

The room is hollow.
Like his metallic head.
The hallway is getting dark.
Like his rusty heart.
Walking machine with no highs.
Programmed for constant lows.
He turns the walk mode off.
This robot has got the blues.
Walking machine with no highs.
Programmed for constant lows.
He turns the smile mode on.
This function fails again....
