Forever Bound Lyrics
by Von Grey.


Beautiful god you look so holy.
You were always lonely.
Still, so much pain wasn't graceful.
Life can be distasteful towards you.

I want to lay my body down.
Sink into your ground.
Press my lips upon your brow.
I want to lay my body down.
I can't go without.
Cause I'm forever bound.

Angel goddess of the moonlight.
Captured by the dark nights.
Farewell, you let go.
I know that you surrendered.
Because you couldn't conquer your fears.

I want to lay my body down.
Sink into your ground.
Press my lips upon your brow.
I want to lay my body down.
I can't go without.
Cause I'm forever bound.

I want to lay my body down.
I want to lay my body down.

I want to lay my body down.
Sink into your ground.
Press my lips upon your brow.
I want to lay my body down.
I can't go without.
Cause I'm forever bound.

I want to lay my body down.
Sink into your ground.
Press my lips upon your brow.
I want to lay my body down.
I can't go without.
Cause I'm forever bound.
