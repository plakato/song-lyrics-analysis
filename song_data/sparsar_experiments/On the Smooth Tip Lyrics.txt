On the Smooth Tip Lyrics
by Sweet Tee.

Testin my mic, one-two, one-two.
I'm here to entertain, yes, this means you.
Don't need no help, all by myself.
I proceed cos you need to enjoy yourself.
Try to compare? oh, don't you dare.
Cos I'm sweeter than the cream in a french eclair.
Smoother than the ice in a skatin rink.
Have I forgotten anything? hm, let me think.
Oh yes, I take a pen, draw you all in line.
You'll find that I'm a lyrical mastermind.
The more you scream, the more I strive.
So get live and put your body in overdrive.
Let's check the situation from a serious tip.
Wanna hear somethin wack? well, this ain't it.
Cos the beat is def and now you're told.
So prepare to work out a little rock and roll.
Lace them shoes, tighten up that belt.
And beware cos it's somethin that you never felt.
Cos it's ruffer than ruff, hipper than hip.
Don't be a drip, let it rip.
But on the smooth tip.

Toes are tappin, hands are clappin.
My deejay's on the cuts and Sweet Tee's rappin.
Rockin the spot cos the jam is hot.
You think I'm through? hm, not by a long shot.
I'm not a doctor, but I'm on call.
I'm not the police, so get off the wall.
In a club on stage to make you move.
A mic and a beat are the tools I use.
Yeah, I been crowned the gift of wax.
Sweet Tee's in the house, so just relax.
Give your hips a ride, give your feet some slide.
And do what you feel inside, you know.
It's easy to do if the beat is hip.
Dancin and swingin, if the needle don't skip.
Straight to the dancefloor, run, don't walk.
Move to the groove, let your body talk.
To me cos I happen to know what you like.
So when I pick up a pen I know what to write.
To hype the jam, so the jam'll hit.
So rock with Sweet Tee on the smooth tip.

Move that stuff, put your body in cruise.
Take it easy and slow, but make it smooth.
Gather around and get on down.
Ain't nothin like hangin when you got some sounds.
To this career I been ordained.
Doin things a anthropolgist can't explain.
Try if you will, I leave em standin' still.
Rap better than me, that noise please kill.
Solve any crime like the great Dick Tracy.
Make more jazz than the late Count Basie.
Rhythmic sounds flow like Lake Eerie.
Alterin any scientifical theory.
Another like me well, I never.
You know why? cos I'm too damn clever.

Bust that, party people, then again, bust this.
It's time for my rhyme to reach the end of the line.
I hope you all had a groovy time.
Without further ado I'mma take my trip.
But remember Sweet Tee, y'all, on the smooth tip.
