Macaframa Lyrics
by X-Raided.

Next song is Macaframa 
Yeah ... for yall, uneducated, ass, bitches, 
Yeah, yeah, yeah foever hatin on a nigga thats havin thangs 
Nigga. These type of situations on lockdown were da real love at 
Yeah, yeah, ..., 
, 
Ain't, no love for them; hoes, an I'm knowin 
Bitches. Only jocking X-Raided cause, I be flowin 
Thats. Why Im showin'em love and affection? 
In? They silky sections, my erections 
Spitten milky secretions in they directions. 
When you in they presence. They say you, king 
But, when you ain't around they clown. Like you, a peasant, 
Fuck givin, the bitches presents 
Diamond rings, and things of that nature get you pussy, fo, sho, 
That, ho'll date, ya and inflate your ego 
But. They got you hero, zero fo show for all your actions. 
You went to jail, wit, no bail. An now ain't nothin cracking 
Bet back when you was free, you thought you had a solid female 
But. Now you can't even get a visit. An' got ta beg for mail, 
Movin lika, a snail when you tryin to get her to handle somethin 
And late at night. She got cum drippin out her bellybutton 
That good for nothin bitch is useless for a convict 
I'm nuttin up on hoez nigga fuck that cum shit 
Her cousins. On my nuts like a little squirrel 
An, I wouldve been to mack her if she wasn't a little girl. 
But about two months from now that little girl gon turn 18 
The number one draft pick on my home team, 
 
Im that gansta you answer to 
When, I say bitch jump, then thats whatcha do 
Im a fast talkin, convict, blowin yo, mind 
Im workin macaframalama. Even if im in da slamma 
 
It dont take much to keep yo man happy doing eight months, 
But it ain't no contact visits. So you can't touch 
An county time. Ain'T, no joke 
In! Sacramento! This shit will have you mental 
Cause. You can't smoke. 
You be stressed out 
Hopin that you get yo case. 
Three strikes tryin to wipe out my whole race. 
Now here comes yo wife, since you done got your time, 
Saying that she can't hang
