Black Demon Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Ancient warriors troops of hell, 
Demon commands parsons to fell 
Iron-bound horses, twinkling gaze 
Marching to win black laws to raise 
Satan's army shields and swords 
Crying Deliverance, raising their lords 
Barking sleuthhounds on the parson's trail. 
Lucifer'S warriors are bringing the gale 
 
Hell troops, conquer, burning the church, 
Raising hellfire satanic rules to urge 
Reaper takes commander's black 
The living dead at his back 
 
Deliverance black demon 
Breaking, the trance black demon 
To that bastard's lethal black demon, 
Tonight 
 
Heart of iron. He scorns the priest 
Satan, he serves sanctifies the beast: 
He drinks, the venom desecrates, the shrine, 
Dethroning god, leaving his mortal sign. 
Satanic lord takes away the scourge, 
He frees all mankind from the church, 
Condemns the moral raises, the sin, 
Revenging the tortured and the loser's win
