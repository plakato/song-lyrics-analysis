Cloud 9 Lyrics
by 60 Second Assassin.

Kristina Green.
If I could pack 'em out I'll lock down every house.
From L.A. to Chicago.
Roll 'em in a blunt I'll let 'em hit it once and they'd be dead.
If I could lock 'em up I'd use so much cut that when they fry 'em half.
They profit is gon'.
Cuz the shit's so damn wrong, they still gon' call.
Tryna get back on, and oooohhhh the sensation when he places his arms around.
me.
I'm higher then I could ever be.

Hell Razah.
Body bags in the back of the Ave.
They keep jacking our swag.
Rubber grip on the .44 mag.
We write rhymes in a scientist's lab.
With a pen and a pad.
So our chemistry is murderous gas.
I got the underground now in a smash.
Its stack digital cash.
And rip commercialized niggas in half.
Put a slash in his 360.
He can't eat with me, unless you come thru the G-60.

60 Second Assassin.
They gotta.
We gon' be what we gonna be.
Money, clothes and ho's.
We don't care about responsibilities.
Love, sex and welfare checks.
We gon' be what we gonna be.
Gangsters, hustlers and a whole buncha murders for flavors.
You're a million miles from 120 degrees, 120 degrees.
Nobody's smiling.
Cloud 9.

Son One.
I can't lie in class I wrote rhymes.
Had my face in the book resource was on mind.
Never said much, my thoughts was online.
And my notepad yeah the Son is gon' shine.
Even got reprimanded by my school counselor.
She said Son you would never amount to a....
WHAT!?! Successful man with these types of grades.
Quit all that rapping jargon throwing all your life away.
And all that hype and praise won't see the light of day.
Even my moms tried to pray, hoping my mind would change.
But I couldn't keep the fire tamed in.
My heart playing beats yo I spend entire days in the dark.
Under a desk light, tryna create the darts.
Fighting the livest spark, designing a timeless art.
The wordsmith, I split these mics apart.
Out the dirt, unearth, polish the diamond.

Hell Razah.
Body bags in the back of the Ave.
They keep jacking our swag.
Rubber grip on the .44 mag.
We write rhymes in a scientist's lab.
With a pen and a pad.
So our chemistry is murderous gas.
I got the underground now in a smash.
It's stack digital cash.
And rip commercialized niggas in half.
Put a slash in his 360.
He can't eat with me, unless you come thru the G-60.

Shabazz the Disciple.
Now I lay, you down to sleep.
I pray to Lord my soul to keep.
And if I shall die before I awake.
I pray to Lord my soul he take.
Another time my mind dwelled on a spell I heard.
Cries from the dead souls burning in hell.
Visions of their flesh, drowning in the flood.
One of the hallucinogens and I seen head soaked in blood.
I snapped back to reality, dashed for my Bible.
Opened it up, in heavy confusion, reaching for survival.
But all of a sudden, I'm overpowered by that curse.
The psalms that I read, made my visions worst.
Seen a therapist, told 'em spirits tried to bury me.
Spilled what's on my mind, when I was done, he needed therapy.
He recommended a baptism, a sacrifice.
My soul rose to heaven but was cast back down by blast.
In forms of thunder, rain, hail, heavy winds.
Not even the blood of Christ could cleanse my conscious of sin.
