Usual Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

I have to forget.
Your number.
Because it's been getting.
Me in trouble.
Last night on the phone.
I said i was ok alone.

But here I am again.
Outside your door.
Predictably yours.
And I know this feeling.
Because I've felt this way before.
I'm in love as usual.

When you said you loved me.
Did you just mean you missed me.
Because I don't know the difference.
And these feelings get confusing.
Next time you visit home.
Maybe I shouldn't know.
