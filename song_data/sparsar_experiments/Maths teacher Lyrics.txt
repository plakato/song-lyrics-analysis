Maths teacher Lyrics
by ZO'clock.


I get into it just to do it. No excuses now point your finger in the mirror. If
You blew it .., 
Who wan, know na ur fada na im get money pass so person no go hear word ..., 
 
As. I was saying i was caught up in a chariot of fire. Ok, that's a lie. Sha 
Buh, i disappeared like an eyeshadow under a heavy shower, a shallow excuse. For
Wasting hours of your day, infront of a mirror 
Feeling inferior cause. You had a serious skin disease all over your face: and
you couldn't evn chyk vic-toria fgc keffi is a story-am so bound to tell 
 hell no.. 
You camou-flagin'. Now you so nostal-gic
