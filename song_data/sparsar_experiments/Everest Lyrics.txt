Everest Lyrics
by Wrathschild.


Oh, I'mma make it to the top for you.
Till my heart and my hands are blue.
Gonna climb till you're mine.
Gonna get to you.

Shocked me with your touch.
Now, I don't wanna wait another day, no, no.
I've never felt so much.
There's no chance I could let this slip away.
Woah-ohh, ohh.

If we could get it on tonight.
If we could become one life.

I would jump off Mount Everest.
I would scream at top of my lungs.
I would do just about anything.
Just to get inside of your arms.

Drop.
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh.

I'll lay you down in my bed.
Recharge you, love you back to life.
Walk all the way to Tibet.
To greet you, catch you from the sky.
This is my only vision.
Going on a mission even if it's the last one of my life.

Oh, I'mma make it to the top for you.
Till my heart and my hands are blue.
Gonna climb till you're mine.
Gonna get to you.
Oh, I'mma make it to the top for you.
Till my heart and my hands are blue.
I will die, soon as I get to touching you.

Wait!

Drop.
