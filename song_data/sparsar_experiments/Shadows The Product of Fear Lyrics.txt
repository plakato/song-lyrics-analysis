Ok I'm buggin.
Why ain't she saying something.
I messaged her at 1am.
Should have never gave my number.
I knew it was too good.
To be true.
When she said to hit her up.
She was thinking friends.
Man I was thinking snuggle up.
Maybe something serious.
Maybe she curious.
Now I'm second guessing the signs.
That was there period.
Furious my rash decisions.
Got my trippin over bitches.
And I'm looking at these ones.
Not even into tipping strippers.
Now I'm a tight wad.
Holding on to money and these feelings.
Spilling my frustration out.
Incapable of even chillin.
But in my dream though.
She was there and feeling me.
But I don't know if i believe the dreams.
Or reality.
Or the fantasy.
That will never be.
Still trying to think about.
The situation rationally.
Or anything else actually.
Don't want to make no casualties.
Of innocent thoughts.
That's escaping my heart's natural reach.

Lies, deceit.
Please give it to me.
I'm feeding off anger.
Your paranoia is me.

Let me live in the bliss.
Let me picture the kiss.
Let me think of all the things.
Without you there I would miss.
Fabrication is my friend now.
Who really needs some sanity.
Not living in the moment but.
But I'm living in my fantasy.
Let me close my eyes.
And be engulfed my dreams.
Sleep forever living happy.
No more sadness or fake screams.
False hope or hopes up.
Falling in a dope truck.
Plagued by my addictions.
All plagued no one to hold us.
Drowning in the madness.
Drowning in the sadness.
Drowning being hopeless.
Never getting past this.
Falling to my demise.
Yea you falling for my disguise.
No surprise that you sympathize.
When you claim that you empathize.
You really don't despise.
The goodbyes and the unwise.
Just be open minded.
To minds as they unwind.
So now I'm unkind to my kind.
My turn to pass it.
I'm falling forever.
Ever and I'm past it.

When I look down I can't see the ground.
I only feel the wind.
I only feel the darkness.
The fear of the inevitable.
But yet I'm ready.
I've been here before and I'm ready.
I'm prepared but still.
Still I'm anxious.
Nothing can soothe the furious beating of my heart....
Nothing... nothing but the....
