Last Flight Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

I'm saving this high for you and me.
The summers at your door.
Schools out for summer.
Don't watch it fall apart.
It's up to you.
It's up to me and you.
Can slow this down.
Arrows scrape across our skies.
Summer blood behind the scenes.
Carve a note inside a tree.
And you'll forget these songs.
Come on and lay down.
Can't let go.
Summer blood, they know.
It's up to you.
Can slow this down.
Arrows scrape across our skies.
The silver lines around the truth.
Are dry enough to shield your view.
The silver lines around the truth.
Are dry enough to shield me from you.
Can't slow this love in real time.
The silver lines around the truth.
Can't slow this love in real time.
