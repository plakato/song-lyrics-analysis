No Flex Zone (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Yung Rudd.


No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone.
They know better x4.

Rudder coming in and I'm damn fly.
Couple spliffs in, damn high.
Only have one life, be a good sport.
Take two pull until your eyes're Shanghai.
You know, Chinese low.
Puff puff pass til we get irie, yo.
Cannabis cannabis, my rhymes them attached to the joints like Siamese so.

Allyuh know de scene already.
Running this rap shit.
Now Rudder is ratchet.
With Hardy on the team, we're shelling.
Lyrics immaculate.
Hope allyuh could catch it.
Like cricketers playin T-20... uh.
Metaphors I got many... uh.
Thought y'all knew like Delhi... uh.
Killin y'all dreams like Freddy... uh.
On the boulevard by Jenny's... uh.
With a best thing from foreign.
Feeling my T&amp;T Spirit, no ferry... Uh.
Giving me forward, that means that I'm scoring.
Like Germans in the semis... uh.
Have Nah Boy as her text tone.
I'm not the one to play with, like a stush girl it's a no flex zone.
God damn.
Going ham.
Like Trinis on christmas.
Give me the spliff cuz.
Grams.
No jam.
Hit up the push.
Give me the kush.
Smoking, toking.
Bretheren I'm floating.
Don't give an F B, your girl I be poking.
Like you're Mecasmi, you only be coasting.
You're really a donkey dan, fuss you be toting.
Grow nuts in that scrotum.
And when you do, make like your Texas and hold 'em.
Like me cause I'm up at the top of the totem.
You know that I'm running this shit' Ato Boldon.
Damn.
It's we they say that up damn next.
Gonna be the top or I'll be damn vexed.
But I'm spitting hard so you can't flex.
Paxx 'Em.
