Jump back (alternate) Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Last night night before

24 robbers at my door

I got up and let'em in

Hit'em in da head with a rolling pin

When. I got'em in a Billy goat, town

Billy goat kicked his pappy down

Oh jump back baby jump, back
Oh jump back, baby jump, back
Oh jump jump

Now. I lay me down to sleep

Givin' the bedbugs a chance to creep

If one should bite before I wake

Hope the world. His jaw will break

Oh jump back baby jump, back
Oh jump back, baby jump, back
Oh jump jump

Went to the river. I couldn't get across
Paid five dollars for an old gray. Horse
Horse wouldn't pull. I swapped him for a bull
Bull, wouldn't holla. I sold him for a dollar

Dollar, wouldn't pass. I throwed it in the grass
Grass wouldn't grow. I chopped it with a hoe
Hoe, wouldn't chop. I took it to the shop
Shop made. Money like a bee makes honey

Oh jump back baby jump, back
Oh jump back, baby jump, back
Oh jump

Wait a minute. Baby

Ooh come on. Do it

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh, yeah yeah

Oh, wait a minute. Baby

Oh, come on baby

Oh come on baby

Oh, wait a minute: baby

Jump back jump back, baby

Jump back jump back, baby

Jump, back jump back, baby

Jump back jump back baby

Oh come on baby

Oh come on baby

Oh, wait a minute! Baby

Oh wait! A minute! Baby

Oh come on baby

Oh come on baby
