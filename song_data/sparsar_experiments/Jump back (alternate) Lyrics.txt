Jump back (alternate) Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Last night, night before.

24 robbers at my door.

I got up and let 'em in.

Hit 'em in da head with a rolling pin.

When I got 'em in a Billy goat town.

Billy goat kicked his pappy down.

Oh, jump back, baby, jump back.
Oh, jump back, baby, jump back.
Oh, jump, jump.

Now, I lay me down to sleep.

Givin' the bedbugs a chance to creep.

If one should bite before I wake.

Hope the world his jaw will break.

Oh, jump back, baby, jump back.
Oh, jump back, baby, jump back.
Oh, jump, jump.

Went to the river, I couldn't get across.
Paid five dollars for an old gray horse.
Horse wouldn't pull, I swapped him for a bull.
Bull wouldn't holla, I sold him for a dollar.

Dollar wouldn't pass, I throwed it in the grass.
Grass wouldn't grow, I chopped it with a hoe.
Hoe wouldn't chop, I took it to the shop.
Shop made money like a bee makes honey.

Oh, jump back baby, jump back.
Oh, jump back baby, jump back.
Oh, jump.

Wait a minute, baby.

Ooh, come on do it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ooh, yeah, yeah.

Oh, wait a minute, baby.

Oh, come on, baby.

Oh, come on, baby.

Oh, wait a minute, baby.

Jump back, jump back, baby.

Jump back, jump back, baby.

Jump back, jump back, baby.

Jump back, jump back, baby.

Oh, come on, baby.

Oh, come on, baby.

Oh, wait a minute, baby.

Oh, wait a minute, baby.

Oh, come on, baby.

Oh, come on, baby.
