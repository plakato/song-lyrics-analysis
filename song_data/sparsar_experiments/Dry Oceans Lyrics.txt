Dry Oceans Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


So tired of these thoughts.
From the times that we talked, till the times that we fucked.
I'm surprised that we lost, all the pride that we brought.
In the lines that we crossed, both tryna be the boss.
Saying what's mine will be yours.
Whenever your eyes dry from crying, we could die for it all.

Momma said say what I'm feeling, to make sure when I say it you feel it.
You said the other day I was tripping. Wait, okay, I was tripping.
Or we was, cause I don't see what's the big deal, when you know I'm faithful.
to women.
But, you say it don't make a difference. Why?
Cause for the last six years I remained independent.
Or maybe I'm just afraid of commitment or committed to be afraid of what's.
missing.
And what's missing is, I'll wait.
I'll face the fact, I pushed women back just to feel safer to distance.
Shit! Dry oceans on a rage of existence.

See, knowing both my parents are still together.
Brother happily married, I'm starting to feel the pressure.
It's still whatever, I'm good if you feeling better.
Open the envelope, the message is in the letter, like.
Dear Love, we here love.
I'd rather not box in that ring, let's share gloves.
I really can offend you, shit.
Cause you was with me shooting in the gym when I could barely even dribble.
You say I make time for things that I want, and you right.
But them bills is due every month.
And I need to feed family, need to be loved.
Like a feen needs drugs and vampires need blood..

We could die for it all.
When your tears dry and they gone.
Girl, we could die for it all. We could die for it all.
From the rise to the fall.
Girl, we could die for it all. We could die for it all.
You ain't gotta cry no more.
Girl, we could die for it all. We could die for it all.
