Pound Cake Remix Lyrics
by The Universe.


I don't hop in yo beef cuss i'm a vegetarian, Nerdy glasses so quiet like the.
librarian. My flows quick so when i rap dis it get scary. Medea on you bro i.
goes in Tyler Perry. And you really shouldn't copy me, you like toffee cuss.
i'm chewing on you constantly. You say i suck,so you acting dishonestly. And.
when i come threw you better give yo boy apology. And you really like a wanna.
Be, cuss when Cuss when i go in All these dudes Mocking me . This is real.
talk. I won the lottery. Because these other rappers bland,and i give you more.
quality. And you really shouldn't bother me, cuss once i go off i'm like a.
bomb there's no stopping me. You studying my rap, Like the bible Doxology. I.
live by this stuff, so when i lie i'm really honesty. That's real , You know.
the deal.We keep it trill. I'm super fly out here made of steel.

I close my eyes,and dream. That life gets better. Everybody bite off me, i'm.
more like a trend setter. You girl at school taking selfies in my sweater. I'm.
Hard like a rock, but you more like a feather. I'm cold like Ice so i'm Swiss,.
like cheddar. You talking like you nice,but i put in more effort. And i don't.
really care. I'ma make this clear. When you talking bout me there's no one who.
compares. I dare, you to step up. Im like a legend you a rookie with this.
stuff. you know what im talking bout, you got control on your girl, so why she.
walking out. She coming through tonight , no doubt.You tryna start a fight,.
then i'ma knock you out. Knock Knock, Them shots is getting hard to count..
Them shots getting hard to count.
