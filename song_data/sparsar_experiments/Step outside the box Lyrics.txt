Step outside the box Lyrics
by The Virus.


Can u prove to me that god exists.
And convince me what is positive.
Are u what people like to call a savior or the opposite.
Are all decisions provocative.
If u lost something important and i found.
I would not decide to steal.
But if we were in different shoes.
Then u would pocket it.
My thoughts are getting lost in this.
I just want u to think about it.
Im not tryin to change your ways.
I just want u to make some trips around it.
I dont want to hang in the mist about it.
Cause i know some of you dont give a shit about.
But follow.
And let ur thoughts about it sit back and wollow.
They would probly boo me at the apollo.
People who have lots of time to rest.
Because they never try ur best.
Are the same people on the street tryin to rip the change out the passerbyers.
chest.
In the end ull end up with less.
And when the battle's over u claim to be the one that palms the ball.
I guess hopsin was right after all.
keep bullshittin' till ur life is gone.
Cause livin's naturally hell u have to work to put a smile on.
