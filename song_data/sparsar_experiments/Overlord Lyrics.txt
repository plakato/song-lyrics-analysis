Overlord Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: Voodoo Caravan.
Overlord.
I've been cursing my holy maker.
Now I'm watching your earth from below.
Been drowning myself with a spoonful of wine.
Just to see where the journey might go.
I've been aching to live in your garden.
So I'm building a hole in the wall.
Yeah I'm sipping the greed it was what I believed.
To be fuel for my poor dying soul.
Let me be overlord.
I need to satisfy myself.
Let me be overlord.
Nothing is real of the things I can see.
I am watching your earth from below.
I have seen with the eyes of the future.
I've been living a daydream too long.
Been exploring the moon with my needle and spoon.
Wish tomorrow, my yesterday's gone.
Let me be overlord.
I need to satisfy myself.
Let me be overlord.
Nothing is real of the things I can see.
I am watching your earth from below.
