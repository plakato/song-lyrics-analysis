Whittier Blvd. Lyrics
by The Wow.


I got the swagger of a litigator 
Major business. 
You would think that I'm a business major 
From, a smaller town, but now I'm gettin' bigger paper, 
Business meetings, 
Eating dinner with them nigga haters 
Because. They know that they can never fade us 
Talkin'. All that blazay blah 
I'm, like yeah yeah, whatever PAY US 
Headed to the top, I'm ridin' on them, elevators 
And. When I get there push the button on them: detenators 
BOOM 
Because a nigga'bout to blow up 
Quarantine the building. Every time a nigga show up. 
You know what 
My creez so sick. It makes me wan na throw up 
Am, I, the badest and the meanest, and the coolest 
NIGGA SHO'NUFF 
My life is a movie, I'm livin it widescreeen 
Overnight flights on the red eye, my nigga no visine, 
That, GMOD, music, gettin out my dreams, 
Connected like WiFi 
You. Getting that live stream 
 
This shit is all that I know 
Spit these flows and get this dough 2X 
 
Comin down and I'm ridin' 
Damn right, I'm ridin' 
Comin down and I'm ridin' 
Damn right, I'm ridin' 
Comin down and I'm ridin' 
Damn right, I'm ridin' 
Comin Down and I'm ridin' 
Damn right, I'm ridin', 
 
 KO THE LEGEND 
 
Ask, my homey TC 
Ask, my homey BG 
We be doin. It big screen, 
IMAX, that's 3D 
Real life, no CG 
Don't act! Like you don't see me 
I, be smokin that Spielberg 
Like. I cut the finger off E.T 
Back it up girl, beep, beep 
I'mma, give ya that skeet skeet 
Then. I give ya that two times 
Then. I give ya that three-peat 
After that then it's deep sleep 
My time isn't cheap freak 
So, I'm out 
And it's on the low 
I'm like TLC 
Cuz. I creep creep, 
 
Talking KO THE LEGEND 
 
Look. I know I know I got of topic a little bit. 
But these beat is too creez. Man 
I had to swag it out a lil bit: 
TOTALLY WOW
