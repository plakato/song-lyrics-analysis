Half A Man Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

On my first round up.
Got a triple header, nothin better.
Anything spectacular, that's me.
I had you on the first thing.
Smokin to my paradise?
Only you would be the one to not know what it is.
Tell me? Tell Me?
Who made you better?
Who kept it ready? when you need it good and ready?
Good comeback got you sweating.
Just one more question.
Oh why you're sweatin.
Is it cause it's too much pressure.
Maybe now you learned your lesson.

I'm going back to my first love.
Cause that's the lover, that loves me the best.
Since you're not half the man I am.
I guess I'll be loving myself.
I'm going back to my first love.
The lover, that loves me the best.
I'm going back to my first love.
Guess I'll be loving myself.

Call me strange, whatever.
I know I can love me better.
Than the little boy.
That's tryin to be a man.
Got caught up in your hype.
Now you missed the spot light.
You thought you was a star.
Now I'm snatchin your lime light.

Tell me? Tell Me?
Who made you better?
Who kept it ready? when you need it good and ready?
Good comeback kept you sweating.
Just one more question.

Did you think you wouldn't learn your lesson.
Tryin to flex on me.

I'm going back to my first love.
Cause that's the lover, that loves me the best.
Since you're not half the man I am.
I guess I'll be loving myself.
I'm going back to my first love.
The lover, that loves me the best.
I'm going back to my first love.
Guess I'll be loving myself.

Used to be closer, now we be on different continents.
I done packed me some confidence.
Got you saying that I'm a trip.
Had to flip the script on you.
I played my roll and like I'm proud of it.
Ladies promises ?
Damn at least we could honor ?
Presidential suite in rome, baby girl I'm dialin in.
And I know you're phone on silent mode.
But pick it up I'm calling in.
And I notice that your a star and all.
But girl I keep you shining.
And if I must I will remind you that.
And I would definitely ?

I'm going back to my first love.
Cause that's the lover, that loves me the best.
Since you're not half the man I am.
I guess I'll be loving myself.
I'm going back to my first love.
The lover, that loves me the best.
I'm going back to my first love.
Guess I'll be loving myself.
