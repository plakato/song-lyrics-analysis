Never Let Them Lyrics
by ViZion.


246 it's ViZion, ViZion.

Big life in the city with the lights on.
Or gutter life in the gully where the gun's strong.
Gangstas got money and they ducking from the long arm.
Suits got credit in the sky, so they fly on.
G6 jets, running rolex time.
With eastern connect, money's in the pipeline.
Intra-tech nines, keep gang turf defined.
And we living in a system where we led by the blind.
Bloods and the crips, gaza and the gully.
West coast thugs, make east coast money.
There's a war on drugs, but no war on hungry.
And it always ends up just the same.
I'm really wishing on the planes like they're shooting stars.
Switching lanes in the ranger, like a movie star.
Anyway I'm living, keep it glitzing like a superstar.
Shining like a firework, illuminating in the dark.

Never let them bring you down.
Gotta keep ya head above or drown.
Even when they try and pull us down.
Keep up and hold onto your ground.
Never let them bring us down.
In a system we kiss no golden crown.
Even when they try and bow us down.
We're rebels so we stand our ground.

Never let 'em see us weak.
Even ankle deep in hell's heat, yea we keep our feet.
Be like the rose, that grows from the concrete.
Or like the rainbows in puddles on a muddy street.
No matter what they say, it's a hustle everyday.
Gotta make that money, can't that from me, no way.
And on this road, yea the lights do change.
But we running red lights at every stop, let the fire blaze.
In this rat race, the city's just like a maze.
With no pity, where dreams die but never fade.
So keep 'em living, in the nitty gritty hold the faith.
Just keep on, and be strong to fight another day.

Never let them bring you down.
Gotta keep ya head above or drown.
Even when they try and pull us down.
Keep up and hold onto your ground.
Never let them bring us down.
In a system we kiss no golden crown.
Even when they try and bow us down.
We're rebels so we stand our ground.

Red suns dipping, over city haze.
Chilling on the hill, with optimos, kush is in my veins.
Reminiscing, on life in my younger days.
You would never see it though cause I'm in my Prada shades.
And they tripping, I know they got a lot to say.
Everywhere I go is like a show, yea they watching me.
I'm on the go, and I know they wanna drop my speed.
Roadblocks on the block, but 5-0 ain't stopping me.

Never let them bring you down.
Gotta keep ya head above or drown.
Even when they try and pull us down.
Keep up and hold onto your ground.
Never let them bring us down.
In a system we kiss no golden crown.
Even when they try and bow us down.
We're rebels so we stand our ground.
