And Now I'm Nothing Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

I can't help myself.
I keep ending up in Memorial Park.
Breaking finger nails while I claw at the frozen ground.
Because as long as I'm home.
I can dig up these bones.
There's no point to just letting go.
And as long as you've known me I've been backing out slowly.
I won't end up underneath the snow.

This is where it's been.
The manger scene every Christmas.
Next to the cannon.
Every year someone steals baby Jesus.
Nobody stops them.
It's a nice tradition.

I'll put my life back together in silence.
While writing songs on Molly's guitar.
And Suburbia, stop pushing.
I know what I'm doing.

So I moved myself and two boxes of things.
To the basement room at Richie's house.
And I'm happy here for now.
Because I've been in search of some steadier footing.
Or just a place to call home.

But I've been spending most of my nights here alone.
And that doesn't scare me like it did a year ago.

I'll put my life back together in silence.
While writing songs on Molly's guitar.
And Suburbia, stop pushing.
I know what I'm doing.
Suburbia, stop pushing.
I know what I'm doing.
Suburbia, stop pushing.
I know what I'm doing.

I had dreams of myself.
As the Allen Ginsberg of this generation.
But without the talent, madness or vision.
I guess it's looking hopeless.
We're a city left digging out cars in unison.
And humming like we've healed.
I know we've got miles to go.
But I'm putting my shoulder to the wheel.
