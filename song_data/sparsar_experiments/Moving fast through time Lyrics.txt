Moving fast through time Lyrics
by Zoomboom.


Heavy lights out, switches off and on staying like a store, buying the store out till nothing is
left finishing off the night shift. Business is well paper flying on my hands night and
morning sun comes out when i wake up changing the sheets when ladies come
through, the door lighting up the Ls by the min staying out and about smart-
founded, not dumbfounded, think before u do being stupid is dumb. Time is moving through fast
thank? U, for being nice to me, i got the crispy sneakers flying high heights to
scary to reach down brush? U off like a tooth brush your teeth. Stay yellow
like, the sun? U ain't brighter! Then me follow me through the lines falling off the tracks: keeping
it lowkey, deep underground
