Moving fast through time Lyrics
by Zoomboom.


heavy lights out switches off and on staying like a store buying the store out till nothing is.
left finishing off the night shift business is well paper flying on my hands night and.
morning sun comes out when i wake up changing the sheets when ladies come.
through the door lighting up the Ls by the min staying out and about smart-.
founded not dumbfounded think before u do being stupid is dumb time is moving through fast.
thank u for being nice to me i got the crispy sneakers flying high heights to.
scary to reach down brush u off like a tooth brush your teeth stay yellow.
like the sun u ain't brighter then me follow me through the lines falling off the tracks keeping.
it lowkey deep underground.
