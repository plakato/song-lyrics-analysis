Ride With Me Lyrics
by Tyler Tracey.


This girl looking her flyest up in the club.
She dancing with her girls getting ratchet in the club.
She eyeing me down from across the club.
I get the bartender to send her something expensive in a cup.

I comment on her outfit she said You're looking pretty good yourself.
She said this place is boring and she trying to leave.
I thought maybe I could get her to go with me.
She finish off her drink and she order another.
She tells me she's just getting over a lover.
I give her my apologies but she says there's no need.
Because she thinks there's something I can do for her.
So I tell her I'm just parked out back.
She says that's good because this place is kind of wack.
She says maybe she'll catch a cab trying to seduce me.
But I said there's no need, baby, come on and take a ride with me.

Hop in my ride, baby.
Take you to places you ain't ever seen.
Sit beside me like you were my Queen.
Come on and take a ride with me.

Dancing with my girls up in the club.
Ugly guys try to talk to me up in the club.
Spot a young, fly guy from across the club.
He sends me something expensive in a cup.
I give him the stare like come talk to me.
Think about it, decided to approach and see.

Name's Suzy Q boy I need your help.
Place is kind of wack, get out of this place.
Let's hop in a cab we can leave without a trace.
Drive along the coast line, vanish like the tide.
Call ourselves the new Bonnie and Clyde.
Something I know you can do for me.
Get me out of this place, and you will see.
He tells me he's just parked out back.
Ordered another drink, tell him he'll fall in love with me.
