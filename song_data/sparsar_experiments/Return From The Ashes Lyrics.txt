Return From The Ashes Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

I am having trouble with my intuitions*.
Once climbed the wall I see me fall again.
NOW BREAK THE CHAINS.
OVERCOME.
FIGHT FOR THIS, YOU'RE NOT WRONG.
Retaliate or retreat.
Someonce show me belief.
Retry.
Face yourself to take these miles away.
Your head held high.
Never abandon your aims.
Still searching for the end of this vicious circle.
The n realize and despair.
My torture to return.
RETURN FROM THE ASHES AND GROW WITH YOUR FAILURES.
My god, this senseless pain.
It's coming back again.
ONE MORE TIME.
Retry.
Face yourself to take these miles away.
Your head held high.
Never abandon your aims.
Here comes the liar again.
No more lies.
Don't trust his lies again.
No more lies.
OVERCOME.
FIGHT FOR LOVE.
JUST DO IT.
Retry.
Face yourself to take these miles away.
Your head held high.
Never abandon your aims.
