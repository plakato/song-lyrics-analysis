Grey Day Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

No relief from this blue melody.
The right words escape me.
Love you go down.
Love is a race now.

Know your face from this blue memory.
Opened us close on me.
Love you go down love no trace now.

Put your smile on my face stop me.
wasting away.
Make a promise you break.
Green light all the way to a grey day.

Love you go down.
Love no trace now.

Put your smile on my face stop me wasting away.
Make a promise and break.
Green light all the way to a grey day.

Love you go down.
Love no trace now.

Each new voice and good times let me be.
Change your tune sounds the same.

Put your smile on my face stop me wasting away.
Make a promise and break.
Green light all the way to a grey day.
