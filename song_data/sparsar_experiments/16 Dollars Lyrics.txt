16 Dollars Lyrics
by Volbeat.


16 dollars in a back street corner is enough for a beautiful day.
I see a window open hearing Aerosmith rocking with Dick Brave Walk This Way.
I need a quick drink, more volume for the beat.
I see the cats are playing dice.

It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money.
To a fat lady singing boogie woogie chili honey.

I've been walking the streets again.
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again.
Just to see what the day will bring.
But it's the same old song I'll do it again.

I'll bring you home my baby I will.
I would love to bring you home.
I would love to bring you home.
I would love to bring you home.

16 hours in the back in a corner and an empty bottle of Jack and a.
bitch.
Well I'm sorry to inform you that the poison in my body guiding you to walk.
away from this mess.
I need a quick drink, more volume for the beat.
I see the cats are playing dice.
