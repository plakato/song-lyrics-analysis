If I Ever Lyrics
by Aziz.

Let ME GET IT RIGHT: 
 
OHH, ..., 
, 
Yes, a motherfucker like me, stay throwed, 
Like, a baseball or a bad back. 
Where, the cash at 
Nigga got ta, come up with the funds 
For, a fat sack 
Dutch pack and a fifth of rum 
In, the back pack, 
Walking wavy, 
Talking wavy 
Gal, say she don't do this often 
Maybe 
See, who hold it down without tossing 
Baby 
See, who Hold it down without coughing 
Baby 
Got, a roach clip from last night 
Plus we about to blow like a bag. Pipe 
I could use 
A pint of brew 
And some red-haired piff 
Shawn White on the half pipe 
This bud, get the perfect score 
Percolators in my bong 
Potent vapors in my lungs 
Cheeba greener than my lawn 
So gone. 
Nigga 
I. Don'T need no lean. 
Don'T need codeine. 
Cause, I'm high off life and this weed 
Got a good girl lighting. This weed 
I must be bugging 
I'm over here. Tripping 
I'm, watching a movie 
My eyelids are closing. 
Minutes 
I got five
