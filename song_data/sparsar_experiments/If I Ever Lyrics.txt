If I Ever Lyrics
by Aziz.

LET ME GET IT RIGHT.

OHH....

Yes a motherfucker like me stay throwed.
Like a baseball, or a bad back.
Where the cash at?
Nigga gotta come up with the funds.
For a fat sack.
Dutch pack and a fifth of rum.
In the back pack.
Walking, wavy.
Talking, wavy.
Gal say she don't do this often?
Maybe.
See who hold it down without tossing.
Baby.
See who hold it down without coughing.
Baby.
Got a roach clip from last night.
Plus, we about to blow like a bag pipe.
I could use.
A pint of brew.
And some red-haired piff.
Shawn White on the half pipe.
This bud get the perfect score.
Percolators in my bong.
Potent vapors in my lungs.
Cheeba greener than my lawn.
So gone..
Nigga.
I don't need no lean.
Don't need codeine.
Cause I'm high off life and this weed.
Got a good girl lighting this weed.
I must be bugging.
I'm over here tripping.
I'm watching a movie.
My eyelids are closing.
Minutes?
I got five.
Ryan Goslin;.
Nigga I got, drive.

I learned the game.
I know what I want.
And I'm in it.
So won't you step aside.
You ain't my bro.
You ain't my homie.
Why won't you recognize.
Look into a dead poet's eyes.
Ho, its I, with the hydro.
Eyes lower than 5'4.
Woman with hunchback's.
View of dinosaurs.
I'm a prime source.
I'm sauced.
You decide your, life, or become and eye soar.
I soar higher than the Oakland Hill Fire.
And I always win.
Give me rope.
I couldn't tie em.
But bigger fish, I fry em.
Boy boy I ain't got no time.
I just need myself a dime.
That I could fly in from the islands like.
