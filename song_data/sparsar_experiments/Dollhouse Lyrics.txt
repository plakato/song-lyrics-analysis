Dollhouse Lyrics
by Tyler Joseph.


Ever wonder what it feels like.
In a dollhouse.
In a dollhouse.
Something just doesn't feel right.
In a dollhouse.
In a dollhouse.

Cause that's kind of shady.
Nora you're doing too much miss lady.
But you can keep a secret I won't tell.
But if you don't pay him back.
In the form of letter, mail.
Hubby's gon know it all.
The truth as well.
You and the doc got feelings for each other.
Drama for real.
I'm dressed in stockings.
Take heel when you flaunt it.
Should be seen in movie reels, while your spouse is ill.
For real?

Ever wonder what it feels like.
In a dollhouse.
In a dollhouse.
Something just doesn't feel right.
In a dollhouse.
In a dollhouse.

A dollhouse to me is.
The worst place to be.
Especially if Torvald Helmer is suffocating me.

As we put to a beat.
This tragic story.
But please mister theatre teacher don't you comprehend.
That the pretty Mrs. Linde and Krogstad are just friends.
And old man Dr. Rank must be on the smelly dank.
Ms. Nora he likes to spank.
And this rhyme is overthank, you.

Jocef: Something just don't feel right man.
Jocef: Look at me.
Tyler Joseph: Look at me.
Jocef: A city, a city in a dollhouse.
Tyler Joseph: Theatre '09.
Tyler Joseph: Pow.
Jocef: Deuces.
