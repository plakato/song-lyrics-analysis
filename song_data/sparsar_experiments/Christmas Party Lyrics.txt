Christmas Party Lyrics
by 3LW.


Won't you get up? It's a party.
What you waitin on?
What you came here for?
Why you sittin there for?
Playing that role?
Actin unsure?
What all that for?
It's Christmas, it's a holiday.
Time for shopping, spend that money.
We gon' party cause I know you wanna dance.

Hey, get off the wall.
Get on the floor.
And get to steppin.
Hey, kill all the talk.
Get on the floor.
And get to steppin.

Won't you get up out that corner.
Throw ya hands up.
Get yo man's and them up.
Hurry up before the DJ quit.
Spinning that-.
Playing that-.
Hot stuff can't get enough.
So don't stop.
Til you get enough.
Get on the floor.
It's that time of year again.

Treach's Rap.
Vamp Out.
