Horrorcore Savior Lyrics
by SykoCutter.


I was born in a BED OF THORNS, a DEVIL SCORNED,, Killed my mom and LEFT HER.
TORN, cause I had a HEAD WITH HORNS,, Then I rose from the PITS OF HELL, to.
INFLICT A SPELL,, On you humans through my music cause I knew this SHIT WOULD.
SELL,, These other rappers tryin' to DEAD THE VIOLENCE,, But I'm here to.
INFECT THE MINDLESS and SPREAD THE VIRUS like it's HEPATITIS,, All I had to do.
was PERFECT THE SCIENCE,, BEHEAD MY SPINELESS enemies, took their entities and.
LEFT 'EM LIFELESS,, Choke D-toxide with peroxide,, Then look for his body on.
the FOX FIVE news coverage and WATCH LIVE You the queen of TRANNY RAP,, You.
gotta be the only RAPPER STRAPPED with dildos in his FANNY-PACK Fuck around.
and get your GRANNY SMASHED,, While I pour hot CANDLE WAX AND A MATCH down.
your PANSY ASS!,, You faggots CAN'T ADAPT,, Because I'm here to bring.
horrorcore ACTION PACKED SAVAGE ACTS BACK TO RAP!,,.

That's why they calling me the Horrorcore Savior Every day I have more and.
more anger I only came here to torture more strangers Down in the depths of.
Hell in the 44th chamber.

Woke up from the drug buzz, now I gotta torture more bitches,, Forcing all.
these forks til you cough and twitch, I'm gory with,, Saws and shit,.
mutilating pricks with 40 stitches talking shit,, Stalking kids walking like.
I'm awkward in the orphanage,, Where's the gasoline, splash the scene and.
leave decay,, Scenic with a mean display of evil when the feeble pray,, Watch.
me lead the way, shooting with my extra clips,, I'm like an exorcist the way I.
get your neck to twist,, Disrespect a bitch, depression got me stressin'.
shit,, Viagra got me hard to the point that her dress would lift,, Into raping.
nuns, its curtains til the drapes are done,, can't escape the slums, Crystal.
Lake and baths in rum, Basic scum, rearrange your face before I staple some,,.
Triple sixes, I switch swords for trouble,, I'm 6' 4' with big boards and.
pitch forks with shovels,,.

That's why they calling me the Horrorcore Savior Every day I have more and.
more anger I only came here to torture more strangers Down in the depths of.
Hell in the 44th chamber.

Cut your throat and face, the eyes and nose I mostly ate,, Slowly on a ghostly.
chase to poke and break your soul to take,, Fuck a girl, just a blow up doll's.
my only date,, Animals at home I rape to bone and then I procreate,, My flows.
are known as great. zone the state on oxy's,, Go and break the sofa til my.
dome creates a coma,, Slowly taste the soda, add some crack to take for.
later,, Blades to safely save for later, savor taste and ate a gator,, Brawl.
and smash, taking over rings like I'm Hall and Nash,, Think you nice with.
skill, my rhyming sends your mind with chills,, Try to kill, I'm high on.
pills, I told your flesh to try some drills,, If you half as nice I'll slash.
you with a passing knife,, Racing with the Flash, he had a head start and.
passed him twice,, Its like I'm scratching lice, activate my afterlife,,.
Suicide to battle me, your friends are giving bad advice,,.

That's why they calling me the Horrorcore Savior Every day I have more and.
more anger I only came here to torture more strangers Down in the depths of.
Hell in the 44th chamber.
