of trucks. 
Oh? Now you backin up. I tried to tell'em man, 
You lookin sick, you out here Dodge'n, like some Caravans, 
Oh, please don't make me mad. I turn your smile to frown. 
I'Ma, put my middle finger up and start to countin down. 
It goes one. Don'T make me two three go off 
Cause. If I do I'm gon' pop the trunk and reach for that sawed off 
Yeah Cause, we ain't playin games, yeah, I'm from that 4th Ward,

Yeah, You pussy, niggas scared, yeah Unk will pull your card 
Fuck with that squad. Like some spades I'll cut your card, 
It pays the cost to be the boss like Rick Ross, I'm hustlin 
Fat stacks be doublin, while other niggas be strugglin.
