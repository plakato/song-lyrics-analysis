by UNK.

DJ Montay.
Yeah! One time it's your boy DJ Montay right.
Representin that Oomp Camp~!
I got some niggas with me.
DJ Unk, Yola the Great, and me myself of course man.
We bearin up outta Oomp Camp, it goin down.
If you don't give a fuck in this motherfucker put your middle fingers up.
You don't give a fuck bout that other click nigga.
You know what time it is.
Ay ay ay!

Now put them middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck.
Put them middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck {*3X*}.
Fuck them haters, fuck them snitches  {*3X*}.
Fuck them haters, fuck them snitches.

Nigga don't make 'em put them hands on you.
Nigga don't make 'em pull them heaters on you.
Nigga don't make us send the squad on you.
Nigga cause we don't give a fuck about you.

Unk.
You talk a lot of shit, but can you back it up.
Got 15's with red beams pointin out.
of trucks.
Oh now you backin up, I tried to tell 'em man.
You lookin sick, you out here Dodge'n like some Caravans.
Oh please don't make me mad, I turn your smile to frown.
I'ma put my middle finger up and start to countin down.
It goes one don't make me, two three go off.
Cause if I do, I'm gon' pop the trunk and reach for that sawed off.
Yeah! Cause we ain't playin games, yeah I'm from that 4th Ward.
Yeah! I'll find you dead on Bankhead up in Pull Apart{?}.
Yeah! You pussy niggas scared, yeah Unk will pull your card.
Fuck with that squad like some spades I'll cut your card.
It pays the cost to be the boss like Rick Ross I'm hustlin.
Fat stacks be doublin while other niggas be strugglin.
I got them hands and them heaters nigga now who buckin.
And I don't give a fuck nigga, better start duckin.

Interlude.
Fuck you nigga! {*8X*}.
You say motherfuck me? Naw motherfuck you! {*4X*}.
Now rep your zone  now rep your boys  {*4X*}.

You lil' ho  you old duck nigga.
Yeah I don't like you, cause you a bitch nigga.
You lil' snitch  you old fuck nigga.
Yeah I don't fucks wit'cha cause you on that other shit.
You don't fuck with me cause I'm on that gutter shit.
You know my steelo, I don't give a fuck.
When you see me, my middle finger up.
I slap the taste out'cha mouth, for talkin sideways.

Hit 'em up, what's up, I dump and leave a sucker ass in pieces.
Lil' bad ass nigga and nope, you you don't want to see me.
They say I'm crazy, like I anm with them demons.
