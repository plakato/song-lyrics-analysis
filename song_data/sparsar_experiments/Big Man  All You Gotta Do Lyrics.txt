Big Man  All You Gotta Do Lyrics
by Yungen.

**Big Man**.

Yeah.
This is gon piss off like 88% of the hood.

Fam you're a big man and you ain't got no p's.

Blud you're a big man that's still getting in beef.

Fam you're a big man and you still running from the police.

How you're a big man and you still selling weed.
We don't rate that.

Big man catching bus to link a female.
Splashes uni dough now he's working retail.
I don't talk much but me I don't need girls.
Give your girl the D she can you details.
Wait I'm on my grown tip.
You know there's rules don't stunt if you don't own it.
Yeah you made the little dough but you blown it.
While your mom's in the ends doing her cold shift.
Wait, nigga nigga nigga nigga.
Yeah you broke but you got jokes on Twitter, Twitter nigga.
Take your girl to the suite turns you bitter nigga.
You like selling food can't cook a dinner nigga.
Word to Bashy, these youts are all moist.
Big grown men acting like boys.
Yeah and we don't rate that.
The smallest pockets always make the most.

Fam you're a big man and you ain't got no p's.

Blud you're a big man that's still getting in beef.

Fam you're a big man and you still running from the police.

How you're a big man and you still selling weed.
We don't rate that.

Nigga's always talking bout these nigga's ain't important.
They don't even spend a penny on you nigga's.
But if you see me by the bar when you ask me for a glass.
I might buy a little henny for you nigga's, little washed pricks.
Nigga's ain't revising in their yard.
But their in the party how you lying to your marge.
Nigga how you buying out the bar.
When you can't even buy yourself a car.
Mandem still relying on their mum.
Rapping bout money you're a liar and a bum.
Got yourself in beef and you can't buy yourself a gun.
Went to link a girl and you can't buy a pack of gum, you're a washed nigga.
Get back on your job nigga.
Looking like a boss nigga, what the fuck's a quarter to a box nigga.
I ain't got a lot nigga.
But me and Yungen working you can link us at the fox nigga.

Fam you're a big man and you ain't got no p's.

Blud you're a big man that's still getting in beef.

Fam you're a big man and you still running from the police.

How you're a big man and you still selling weed.
We don't rate that.
We don't rate that.
We don't rate that.

**All You Gotta Do**.

I just come off the phone to Raz he just come back from the World Cup.
Boycie's aged they just tryna get their girls up.
Yeah, and that really made me think that success don't have an age.
And life is gone before you blink.
Or maybe we don't think big enough.
Maybe were content on being any other kid that wants to live it up.
But there's a difference between wanting and doing it.
A bigger difference between saying and proving it.
10 grand a show I put it all back into music.
If you was me you'd buy a gun and not to shoot it.
So know I earned it if you see me in that new whip.
On my Play Dirty fuck you and your crew shit.
I bunked school for studio when I know I weren't allowed.
Now them same songs are making mommy proud.
Watching Tinie in the O2 shut it down.
Hoping next time that I'm not in the crowd.
Put the past aside rebuilding with my dad.
After all the hard work yeah he's finally got his cab.
A lack of communication nearly ended our relationship.
But we fixed it just before it went bad.
Dreads has came down for the weekend.
I can see ball's stressing him he can't pretend.
I told him keep grinding and you will get into the team.
All you gotta do is dream.
All you gotta do is dream.
