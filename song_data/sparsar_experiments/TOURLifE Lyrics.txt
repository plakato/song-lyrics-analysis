TOURLifE Lyrics
by Xc.


Reporting live from the bottom.
Niggas wanna talk about the rhymes then I got em.
And if they wanna talk about the cash then I'm on it.
Tell em I'm gone I be back in a moment.
I need more everything.
Fuck what these niggas telling me.
Married to the game and never got her wedding ring.
Thats cuz I want it all I never was into settling.
Love her with half my heart and I promise you I would never cheat.
Nah I don't fuck around.
I just shut em down everytime I come around.
Tryna find a producer with that muthafucking sound.
And soon as he lace me up I promise I'mma run the town.
Since the overflow I let then muthafuckas drown.
Punchlines punchlines Im like who want another round.
But don't worry tho got bars.
I swear I only take shots, because they ain't hot.
Guess they on the wrong track get off it for that train stop.
Young Tim Duncan consider this a bankshot.
Ones for the money they told me you'll never prevail.
Been fresher then hell since the day that I stepped outta jail.
Walked on the court room and looked the judge in his eyes.
On some don't say a word shit like I never will tell.
These niggas acting like bitches they was stressing bout bail.
I wouldn't tripping at all I just sat in that cell.
Writing colder shit why you think I'm over sick?
Everybody got lines none of they shit is dope as this.
Hit the hommie Drew up I told him I'm on some focus shit.

And who you know as cold is this.
Thats a trick question Just tell em to quit guessing.
We just quarantine the booth cause I'm having a sick session.
And we balling to no wonder your bitch checking.
Ya lame too I blame you.
Ain't nothing change duke I came thru to shame dudes.
How you feel now tell me how you feel now.
Games full of actors and I'm bringing the reel out.
Everything get killed now instrumentals especially.
Low expectations of shit they said we'd never be.
Why look behind when so much shit is ahead of me.
I never made excuses I swear I don't know the recipe.
But I'mma do it big for all my niggas that rest in peace.
3 cribs 7 V's all the shit we'd never need.
Shit I guess, my nigga Biddy said it best.
To The Ones U Respect, Living is fucking Everything.
I'm Gone.
