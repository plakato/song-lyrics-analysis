Kaviealstars Lyrics
by 3X Krazy.

**.

Gotta get my money!
Gotta get my money!
Gotta get it... !

**.

Diamonds an clothes.
Money an hoes.
Make lotta doe.
For them thugs an Kavieal's.
Mobbin' a Range.
Stackin my change.
Cuz it ain't no thang.
Gettin it to me's how we play.

We hit the spot on a Sunday afternoon.
It's hella hot the homies sellin rocks.
Actin' a fool.
Aight, cool.
You know the rules.
Linen an jewels.
But you can catch me in a Lex side lined by the pool.
The Mobb kind wit no care for the vice.
My crew was trife.
Stay influenced for a selectable price.
The Mobb Life.
The lime light.
We balla tight.
Mercedez an pretty ladies to fill a room full of spikes.
You bitches hate it cuz we finally made it.
First it was famous now it's the world that we out there takin.
No longer chasin.
Kamakazi to the world yellin.
You cowards jealous!
An wonder why that we all felons.
I do it better.
Crack your cerebellum.
I push a kick to watch my stack develop.
You playa hatas got me born to swell up.
On a mission dodgin clips.
An the Mobb representin.
It's Kaviealstar's.
Handle Bar wishes.
Uh.

We get the money.
Mo' money.
That's how it came.
Rolex, chains an thangs.
My mission's to only gain.
When Otis &amp; Shug sang we get them major change.
Two live playas on they way to do major thangs.
Not juss to floss.
We be the boss.
Like Kingpin's.
Me an B.A. in a rag Ferari swingin.
Wit the connection like the WESTSIDE!
On the best side.
We do it, gotta get the money... right.
An keep it crackin like Kastro hoes say.
Money over tricks buy the tons wit no play.
House party poppin at the Malibu estates.
Diamond jew-els.
Big bodies an sails an Navigate's.
We get them light skinned.
Dark skinned.
Short an tall.
We like them baseball playas you know we knocks 'em all.
Catch me at home plate, butt naked in my drawls.
Grand slams an home runs they never find the ball.
We Kavial's!

**.

Steppin wit my weapon concentratin on seven.
Got both of my knees dirty.
Gamblin.
Two grand on eleven.
My nigga hit.
Yellin out this shit.
Shake 'em up better.
But I'm juss scramblin.
Handlin.
My portion of chedda.
We good fellas.
Hood fellas.
Pop the Crist an hop in the six-hundred.
Cuz ain't question where that bitch runnin.
I hit 'em an quit 'em.
Stick 'em an lick 'em.
But if it's worse enough I bet she pullin my linen.
My head spinnin.
Legs bendin.
It's all splended.
We all grinnin.
Cuz havin a ball cuz we all chillin.
Juss feel the realest.
Don't need to mention.
We juss kickin an stick up enough doe to make a livin, livin.

** 2x.
