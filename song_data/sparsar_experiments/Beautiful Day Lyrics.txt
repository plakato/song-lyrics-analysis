Beautiful Day Lyrics
by U-N-I.

3x.
Just a Beautiful Day.
It feels so good.

Just pump it up and just vibe.

Radiant like LA Sunshine, so let's crack the hen, no coke in mind.
Live for today, ain't promised life.
Roll with the Windows down, bring the night.
As the sun sets and the morning breaks.
Just thank God you was able to wake.
Give a kiss to your girl, A kiss to your mom.
A dap for my niggas that have to bare arms on a....
Beautiful Day, keep it neutral.
Let's all try to be beautiful people.
Respect life, your life is respected.
Turn this tune up, don't dare reject it.
Don't front, I know I got ya open.
Check the dialect from the diaphragm My Man.

Put your Glasses up, you can roll.
it up.
You can drink to this, you can smoke to this.
You can roll to this, put your windows down.
And pump the sound through any hood.
3x.
It feels good.
Just a Beautiful Day.

Just pump it up and just vibe.

I take sips of the OJ, Scramble the eggs.
Put some butter on my 3 pancakes, like the fingers when I'm done.
Take a look outside, I see the sun just begun.
So I hops in the shower, I'm lyin if I said 15 cause it takes about an hour.
And I see it's 75 degrees.
There's no need for me to rock the long sleeves.
I'm hot I'm, I'm Cold.
I'm Cool, I'm Hot.
I see the trees, the kids, the block.
Beautiful little neighbor gave a sexy nod.
One cup of this Kool-Aid to set the day right.
So I'm off to the sunshine, never wastes days like this.
Take advantage of the one life.
Keep your faith to the sky.
That's where the Heaven is?
That's where the dream is well ain't it?
