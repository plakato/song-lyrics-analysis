Savor My Flavor Lyrics
by Wormzz.


Savor my flavor.
I'm stabbing demons with light sabers.
I've always been a Luke.
Though I never had my Darth Vader.
I brought the laser.
Like cyclops.
Everything I spit.
Off the wall.
High tops.
I'm lost at sea without God.
I guess it's cuz I sin bad.
On an Odyssey.
It's odd to see where yo friends at.
When you're broke they're ghost.
Vanished like Bin Lad.
I'm lost inside a box.
Devil's toes on my soul.
Like he borrowed my crocs.
And didn't wear socks.
That's Hot.

I'm Lost in the midst of a mystic mist.
I'm pissed.
Can't even get a kiss.
She won't even touch my dick.
Beat it like I'm Mike Jack.
Forgot what lotion is.
I'm an ugly ogre beast forgot where the potion is.
I really see no point in further existence.
When I drop the tape you probably won't even listen.
Only reason you heard this is cuz I dropped it as a single.

I have no friends.
So I don't mingle.

One of my closest friends turned into a douche.
So now I'm a non factor.
He's at the gym feeling juiced.
I'm just an emperor.
Who wants to impress.
His empress.
But every time we speak.
It feels like you lost interest.

I'm out of anger.
This beats a banger.
I bring the danger.
Savor my flavor.
