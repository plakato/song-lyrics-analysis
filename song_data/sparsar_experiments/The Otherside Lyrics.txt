The Otherside Lyrics
by Russ.

Produced by Russ.

You know what it is when I slide through.
I could lift you up you only 5'2.
Maybe get you drunk, maybe high too.
Maybe fall in love, maybe fall in love.
I could take you to the otherside, yeah.
Show you that there's more than meets the eye, yeah.
Maybe get you drunk, maybe high too.
Maybe fall in love, maybe fall in love.

Listen up girl.
You could push a button and something pops out on.
The otherside but they don't teach that.
They just want you trapped in your mind.

I should let you know that there's a chance you get addicted.
Cause the shit I put you on, ain't really no one out here fucking with me.
But if you're okay with that then lets proceed just grab my hand.
Imma' take you to the otherside, into the promise land.

You know what it is when I slide through.
I could lift you up you only 5'2.
Maybe get you drunk, maybe high too.
Maybe fall in love, maybe fall in love.
I could take you to the otherside, yeah.
Show you that there's more than meets the eye, yeah.
Maybe get you drunk, maybe high too.
Maybe fall in love, maybe fall in love.

Interlude x2: Russ.
Tell me that I'm getting through to you.
Tell me that I'm getting through, through.

I should let you know that there's a chance you get addicted.
Cause the shit I put you on, ain't really no one out here fucking with me.
But if you're okay with that then lets proceed just grab my hand.
Imma' take you to the otherside, into the promise land.

You know what it is when I slide through.
I could lift you up you only 5'2.
Maybe get you drunk, maybe high too.
Maybe fall in love, maybe fall in love.
I could take you to the otherside, yeah.
Show you that there's more than meets the eye, yeah.
Maybe get you drunk, maybe high too.
Maybe fall in love, maybe fall in love.
