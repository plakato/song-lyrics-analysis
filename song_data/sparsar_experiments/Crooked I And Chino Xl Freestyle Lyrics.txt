Crooked I And Chino Xl Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Crooked I.
Yo.
I spit impossible rhymes.
Full of philosophical lines.
My phenomenal shine.
Leave everyone our your opticals blind.
Run you over when it's Apocalypse.
I'm half man half diesel like Optimums Prime.
Cocking this nine to pop ya.
Permanente disfigurement have you rocking.
Half a mask like the Phantom Of The Opera.
Mach three is how fast I'll drop ya.
Walk back to ?? the speed they clocked.
You thought you had it win here.
Like watching porno flicks with six chicks.
I'm the hardest one in here.
Straps on the New Year.
We bust from every night's New Year.
Cerebral hemisphere get blew here.
It's really no need to cuss and fuss.
Just.
Hope out of the bushes scratched up.
From the brush and bust.
I make the angriest atheist praise me, if not.
He's fenna simultaneously pain of a shot.
And I shake his pancreas.
Maybe it's my instantaneous plots.
The craziest emcee couldn't face me.
If an alien gave him this thoughts.
Kamikazes regulate.
I strap a time bomb under my trench coat.
And hug you till it detonates.
I was brain washed by NWA and BDP.
I'm the year 2000 version of the DOC.
And when Crooked I spot these fake clicks.
They better be able to dodge bullets like The Matrix or take six.
I'm so onerous in dominant in prominent hip-hop conglomerate.
On this Continent I'm bombing it.
When Icon ill out.
I spit out rhymes so offensive even Chino will tell me to chill-out.

Chino XL.
I don't care what nobody slits.
Or what they kick.
I punch them in the throat.
And watch them choke like the Knicks.
But why all these rappers want to rhyme like me.
Your words should be like Jon B worships black ponani.
And push me to the point.
I wanna smack them yo.
To try to steal my fans like Chico did to D'Angelo's.
But if imitation were an asset.
There will be nothing left of me but jewelry 52 teeth.
And a belt buckle my skills are to die for.
During writers block I still create this timeless lines of wisdom.
Like they pass the lips of Buddha's.
Who the sharp shooter that's claiming.
That they gonna kill me.
When they see me.
?? a hundred inch color TV.
I'm all for the hezy.
See that your record company done hired.
Chino XL to come and repossess their deal back.
I put the fly to your eye.
Like Ethiopians starving.
Life tedious task.
You no longer have to take pardon.
You shouldn't have start them.
You done, done it.
Go purchases a microscope to read the rappers.
Names that won it.
My brain deserve its own infomercial.
For the how it thinks.
You can't be safe by coping.
Tae-Bo with Billy Blinks.
I turn sins to rock.
To the rhymes of the water drops.
