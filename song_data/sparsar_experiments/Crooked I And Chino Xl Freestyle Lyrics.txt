Crooked I And Chino Xl Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Crooked I 
Yo 
I spit impossible, rhymes 
Full of philosophical lines, 
My phenomenal shine, 
Leave everyone, our your opticals blind, 
Run you over when it's Apocalypse: 
I'm half man, half diesel like Optimums Prime 
Cocking, this nine to pop ya 
Permanente disfigurement. Have you rocking 
Half a mask like the Phantom Of The Opera 
Mach three is how fast I'll drop ya 
Walk back to the speed they clocked. 
You thought you had it win here: 
Like watching porno flicks, with six chicks 
I'm the hardest one in here 
Straps on the New Year, 
We bust from every night's New Year. 
Cerebral hemisphere get blew here, 
It's really no need to cuss and fuss. 
Just 
Hope. Out of the bushes scratched up 
From the brush and bust 
I make the angriest atheist. Praise me. If not 
He's fenna, simultaneously pain of a shot 
And, I shake his pancreas 
Maybe. It'S my instantaneous plots. 
The craziest emcee couldn't face me. 
If an alien gave him this thoughts, 
Kamikazes regulate, 
I, strap a time bomb under my trench, coat 
And hug, you till it detonates 
I was brain washed by NWA and BDP 
I'm the year 2000 version of the DOC 
And. When Crooked I spot these fake clicks, 
They. Better be able to dodge bullets like The Matrix or take six 
I'm so onerous in dominant in prominent hip-hop conglomerate 
On this Continent, I'm bombing it 
When, Icon, ill out, 
I spit out rhymes so offensive. Even Chino will tell me to chill-out 
 
Chino XL 
I. Don'T care what nobody slits 
Or, what they kick 
I punch them in the throat 
And watch them choke like the Knicks 
But. Why all these rappers want to rhyme. Like me, 
Your words should be like Jon B worships black ponani 
And. Push me to the point: 
I wan na smack them yo 
To. Try to steal. My fans like Chico, did to D'Angelo's 
But. If imitation were an asset, 
There will be nothing left of me, but jewelry 52 teeth 
And a belt buckle. My skills are to die for 
During writers block. I still create this timeless lines of wisdom. 
Like they pass the lips of Buddha's 
Who, the sharp shooter. That'S claiming 
That. They gon na kill me 
When. They see me 
 a hundred inch color TV 
I'm. All for the hezy 
See that your record company done hired 
Chino XL to come and repossess their deal back. 
I put the fly to your eye. 
Like Ethiopians, starving, 
Life, tedious task, 
You no longer have to take pardon 
You shouldn't have start them. 
You done done. It 
Go purchases a microscope to read the rappers 
Names that won it. 
My brain deserve its own infomercial 
For, the how it thinks 
You can't be safe by coping 
Tae-Bo with Billy Blinks 
I turn sins to rock 
To, the rhymes of the water drops
