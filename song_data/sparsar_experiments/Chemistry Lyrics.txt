Chemistry Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

I left where I was from.
Felt the rhythm was wrong.
But my eyes for you stayed.
Open every day.

I don't worry about us today.
I feel ok when I hear you say.
It may rain on our parade.
But our light will shine on.

What we have is chemistry.
We will last for centuries.
To the beat of our own drum.
We will march, we will run.
Don't need diamonds or pearls.
We've all the time in the world.
Turn our grey skies into blue.
We will walk in our own shoes.

Never thought I would run.
To the streets I came from.
But I've found from history.
To trust in chemistry.

What we have is chemistry.
We will last for centuries.
To the beat of our own drum.
We will march, we will run.
Don't need diamonds or pearls.
We've all the time in the world.
Turn our grey skies into blue.
We will walk in our own shoes.
