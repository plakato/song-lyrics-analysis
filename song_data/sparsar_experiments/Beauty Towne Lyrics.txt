Beauty Towne Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

Three boys in a burning panzer.
Doing nothing not to shove our throats in the flames.
We shan't let go.
Oh friend oh foe oh friend oh foe.

Beauty towne.
How little have we learned.
Beauty towne.
The fruit that we deserve.
And we had and we had.
And we had more than we could take.

Three orcs under plague of darkness.
And like Egypt, we had it coming all along.
I won't believe.
Oh fiend, oh foe, oh fiend folio.

Chelsea Alvarez, Jherek Bischoff, Scott Goodwin.
Mike Hadreas, Ruthie Haskell, Keehnan Konyha.
Caralee McElroy, Sam Mickens, Zac Pennington.
Jamie Stewart, Wilbert Williams.

Beauty towne.
The hair remains the same.
Beauty towne.
Hung by the rope of shame.
And we tried and we failed not to live this way again.
