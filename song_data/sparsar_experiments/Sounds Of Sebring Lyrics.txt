Sounds Of Sebring Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Now you know how i feel.

A latent calm that's half confused.

Sometimes i'm strong i feel.

That i don't care that i've done wrong.

Finding out what is real for you.

Kinda drawn and half amused.

Feelings change and sometimes i can't deal.

With all these things.

Equivocation.

I'm messed.

Unreasonable tongue is soporific.

Thinking softer softer still.

I really ought to know.

You should.

Now you know how i feel.

Kinda drawn but half uncertain.

Thinking what if maybe.

There is something greater still.
