Who's There? Lyrics
by Running Legion.


Yo!
It's open!
You can come in.

An excellent beat maker steps in the door.
I give dap to Shrine, never met him before.
We get in work as soon as we get the groove.
Making sounds similar to that of CL Smooth.
And P Rock too, this is Madvillainy.
Beats too hard that the shit is killing me.
Your rhymes are worth that of a shilling, please.
Save room for Shrine and I, we're chilling we.
In AZ, this some grilling heat, I'm in roast mode.
I'ma pack my mind with rhymes, the most load.
Got enough for these clips, however much my holster holds.
Darius knows I'm that of what a ghost wrote.
Shine said he got a beat for me, send me the link man.
Make sure it doesn't get into some weak hands.
It'd be nothing more than a funny leak man.
I'm telling you now, I think I need a shrink man!
Yo it's the god damn running legion.
