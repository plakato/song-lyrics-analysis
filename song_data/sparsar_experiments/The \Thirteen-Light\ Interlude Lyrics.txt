The \Thirteen-Light\ Interlude Lyrics
by XamVolo.

Oh what a decision.
We've chosen a division.
Striking poses like depictions.
Pictures of Old Kingdom Egyptians.

Are we too old to be musicians?
Are we too known to be forgiven?
Are we too grown to break tradition?

Are we too gold to be imprisoned?
Are we too like the opposition?
Are we too right to switch positions?
Are we too bright for these magicians?
Are we too dark for definitions?

Am I too calm for you to listen?
Are we too blind for exhibitions?
Are we designed for our morticians?
Are we assigned to have ambition?
Are we alive as an audition?

When will we find the competition?
When will we find the great physicians?
When will lose our inhibitions?
