Wednesday (Official) Lyrics
by WolfTyla.


Step up in the spotlight.
Know tonight is my night.
You know we ‘bout to turn it up.
Bout to call my girl like right now.
She ‘bout to pull up to the spot with the crew.
Long hair, diamonds, red bottoms on her shoes.
Music ‘gon be blastin' in the background…
Shut the party down in my town.

I'm throwing a party this Wednesday..
Everything is all on me..

Everything on me, on me.
Party going up in the middle of the week.
So bring your shawties and bring your homies cause.
Sitting home gon' leave you lonely for the night.
Step up in the spotlight, I'm feeling myself.
We party, we party.
Til six in the AM.
Next week we back here again like…

It's my party I could cry if I wanna.
We ain't got no problems, oh no I'm sorry.
Dressed in designer, dressed in Bulgari.
Dressed in all black we looking' like some stars we.
Dressed like girls that you wanna see.
Party look like somewhere you wanna be.
On a #WolfWednesday you know where I be.
Don't I look like a girl you put in a ring.
So put a ring on it, baby, put a ring on it.
And if you likin' what you see then put a ring on it.
So turn, up the volume, turn it up the loudest.
Me and my girls we turnt out the party!
