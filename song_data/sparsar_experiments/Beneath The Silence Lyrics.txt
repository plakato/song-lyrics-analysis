Beneath The Silence Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

A mind full of haunted shadows.
Keeps away the painfull sleep.
Light a candle for the sacred moment.
Needless thoughts are in to deep.
Scary pictures behind the curtain.
Burn my eyes and melt the tears.
Lonleyness in a hidden chamber.
Unlock the doors to forgotten fears.
There is nothing left to take.
All I do is lay awake.
B e n e a t h t h e s i l e n c e.
