Carnival Lyrics
by Zodiac.

Take Your Turn, Don't You Turn Around.
The Future, Change Has Come.
Don't You Mind Your Destination.
You Better Be On Your Way!

Don't You Be Afraid To Call Me A Fool.
Now That Be Shaken Your Hand.
Don't You Be Afraid To Call Me A Fool.
Now That Be Shaken Your Hand.
Carnival Of Broken Hearts.
Give Me Your Time, I'll Give You Mine!
Carnival Of Broken Hearts.
Give Me Your Time, I'll Give You Mine!
Time For Spinning Round And Round.
Time For Spinning Round And Round.
