Scissorlips Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


She's got scissorlips and now i really understand.
Why i am bleeding from my heart down to my hand.
She's got scissorlips and now i am feeling good again.
I waited and i like it like it like.

She walks on me like mountains.
Bathing in pale fountains.
It's alright she's alive.
I'm good at baby's aging.
I need some new persuasion.
It's alright there's a live.

My fascinations got me jumping down saving for road.
When her machine is operating she is operating on my soul.
And then i cry.

She spoke of diamond islands.
Of bleeding heart and violence.
Its alright its a lie.
She said she didn't want it.
I know she didn't mean it.
It's alright she's alive.

Like i'm bleeding to the vein she makes me feel in love again.
Gotta get it up gotta give it up x2.
She's the scissors to the skin.
Makes me want to live again.
Gotta get it up gotta give it up x2.
