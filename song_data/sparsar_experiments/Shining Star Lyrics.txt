Shining Star Lyrics
by 702.


What we had was a thing of the past.
And I recall showering you with gifts, you never had to ask.
Thought love was real.
Damn near gave you my last, bracelets with the karats.
Purchasing class, that was me.
Now you're alone and empty, bitter.
To put it simply, I know you miss me.
And that must be a hard pill to swallaw.
I feel for your man, I'm a hard act to follow.

How I find the time to think of what we had before.
When everybody I know in dancing on the floe.
Since you left the time has been so slow.
Well, let it come out of my mind, where else can it go.

See I need you boy.
I honestly feel I can't bare my health.
See I need you boy.
That's probably why I dance with myself.

You're my star.
Far, True or near how you shine.
So no matter how far.
I'm dancing with you in my mind.

Baby its cool with me, you left, ran off with friends.
I bet I know it won't be long until its on again.
We got harmony to every note.
We can palm a physic if you like, whatever floats ya' boat.

See I need you boy.
I honestly feel I can't bare my health.
See I need you boy.
That's probably why I dance with myself.

You're my star.
Far, true or near, how you shine.
So no matter how far.
I'm dancing with you in my mind.

Baby, we used to walk and talk.
And you would hold my hand.
And by the time we finished talkin'.
We were learnin' how to plan.
And I can't wait till we move together.

Again.
Ah, baby.
I want you so much.
Its like you got the Midas touch.

You're my star.
Far, true or near how you shine.
So no matter how far.
I'm dancing with you in my mind.

You came to the home, to the water front castle.
Hopped on my king-sized bed and we wrasled.
Closet full of thousand dollar shoes with the tassel.
You heard the chef, you know what he ask you.
What you like to eat.
Meanwhile Donatello on the other line askin' massage your feet.
We laughed all day, nights we treasured.
Damn, it's a shame that we couldn't stay together.

We used to walk and talk.
You would hold my hand.
We were running kinda late.
And I can't wait till we move together.
Mmm, again.

You're my star.
Far, true or near how you shine.
No matter how far.
Dancing with you in my mind.
