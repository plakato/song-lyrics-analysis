Bring the Pain Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


I kill a beat and fade off in to the dark.
I'm a murder man nigga, nigga pass the white chalk.
Walk it like I talk it.
Huffing and puffing like I'm the hogg.
And if I'm missing money than I turn into a hawk.
See me speeding in the car.
With no worries bout the law.
Only see big money so don't ask where I saw.
You waking up trapped bitch that's the movie Saw.
And niggas still hating on me.
Give me face.
Ain't no beating around the bush.
Ten toes under god.
Prison flow watch me stand behind my bars.

Will be finished later!
