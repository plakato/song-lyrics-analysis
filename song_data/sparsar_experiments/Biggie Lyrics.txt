Biggie Lyrics
by Russ.

Produced by Clark Kent.

Yeah, How To Rob.

Yeah, I'm limitless without the pill, but I'm still poppin'.
Ten albums deep and still droppin'.
Haven't found a coffin yet, for these flip floppin' bitches.
But I'm still shoppin.
I think I hear the fat lady singing though, Jill Scott.
I'm still watching people pay themselves, that's a damn shame.
You'll remember what I do and what I did when your man came, from my fan base.
It's what I'm focused on, zoom in.
Have me on the Wake Up show, NYC radio, tune in.
There's a movement, that you should move wit'.
On some cool shit, like George Gervin.
My fingers rolling down these girls curves, got 'em purrin'.
'Til the birds chirping, then I'm ghost.
Imma' make a bunch of my money, move my family to the coast.
Imma' put the cape on, fix the game, cause it's broke.
Best man for the job, let's have a mu'fukin' toast.
Looking back when I closed, my text book.
Now I'm known in places round the globe, where I ain't step foot.
Blowing on the best kush.
When I do smoke, cause I prefer the Nuvo.
Actually, Tanqueray, phone full of new hoes.
Had to block my ex bitch, like Manute Bol.
Team full of MJ's, no Toni Kukoƒç.

Who's show is this?
Are you double dollar sign?
Yeah, I said, who's show is this?
Fuck the show biz, I show you what the biz is.
No limits, mutha' fukka'.

Show you How To Rob.
I said, I'll show you How To Rob.
Let me show you How To Rob.
I can show you How To Rob.
Let me show you How To Rob, yeah.
Show you what it is, yeah.
Now Imma' show you How To Rob, yeah.
Wuh-ooo.
Biggie.
Baby babay.
R-I-P.
To the legend.
Yeah.
