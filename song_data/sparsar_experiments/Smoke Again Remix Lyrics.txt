Smoke Again Remix Lyrics
by XP.


Fuck Yo Couch!

I don't even talk to them on the phone again.
Leave in the AM, on the road again.
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again.
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do.

Who humping on my girl?, it's that nigga XP.
AKA the avid asshole AK Dizzy Gillespie.
I've got some folks in New York I got some folks in Philly.
I know these niggas see me but they ain't never feel me.
Oh we back again ya'll nigga ain't shit like breaking wind.
I'm probably never ever ever gonna smoke again.
But tron in the game I was born to win, no J.cole I was born to sin.
Ya'll niggas ain't bad just bordering, the game is ours no loitering.
She was already on me, no phone bill how I keep em' roaming.
I'll give it to you straight this is what she told me.
My name's XP because their extra phony.
So we went to the crib like a babies rattle.
These niggas talking shit but they don't wanna battle.

Making my mind up, living my own life.
Wanna be a wind up? wind up dead.
When I'm fired up I'm just wilding while I'm rhyming.
But I'm trying to make a difference even be the best.
I confess that my train of thought was off track.
But it's back and the bragging is the dead in the past.
I'm ahead of my class so I rap like Chance.
Take a chance and you might just get where you been.
Looking for looking for a wooden time and the course of my grind.
Came in fortunate and I have been fortunate scorching these lines.
That I'm rapping I'm actually asking for help so my passion can blossom.
We can all be colossal and popping.
I just wanna get on like a top and I'm stopping at nothing.
I'm busting these shots if Busta could rhyme is it nuts to think I.
Could do the same? Probably.

Yeah we been working hard yeah you better know it.
We've been making hits this chance I'll never blow it.
