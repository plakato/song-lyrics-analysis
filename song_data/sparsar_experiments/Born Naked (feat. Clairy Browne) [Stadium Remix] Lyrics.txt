Born Naked (feat. Clairy Browne) [Stadium Remix] Lyrics
by RuPaul.


Who you waiting for?
Another savior.
Always looking but you never find.
Never find.

Waking up from.
Another night gone.
Always looking but you never find.
Never find.

RuPaul &amp; Clairy Browne.

Going downtown.
You know where you going.
Throw your top down.
Like you know where you going.
Tell me one thing.
Through your life.
Where you going.
Ignoring all of the signs.

I'm telling the truth now.
Telling.
I'm telling the truth now.
We're all born naked.
And the rest is drag.

Who-who Who do you think you are?
Who-who telling the truth now.
Who-who Who do you think you are?
We're all born naked And the rest is drag.

A lonely highway.
You drove the wrong way.
Always chasing down the fantasy-fantasy.
A sexy muscle car.
Under the radar.
Always looking but you never see-never see.

I'll say it again.
It's never been the clothes that make the man.
Nothing can.
Leave your baggage behind.
And I said.
