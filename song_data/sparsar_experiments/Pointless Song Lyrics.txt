Pointless Song Lyrics
by Zoltan Nebula.

I'm going to the store get myself a pack of smokes.
I'm goin back home and maybe crack a couple jokes.
I'm makin people laugh, but I don't wanna laugh.
Cause I'm way too busy always doin math.

I'm not counting cash, I'm counting lives.
I'm counting all days that I've survived.
Trying to be grateful and feel mesmerized.
But I'm still miserable which is no surprise.

I wanna feel a vibe, I wanna feel alive.
I wanna relive looking in your eyes.
And seeing stars and heaven and the galaxies.
Knowing for a brief moment you were a part of me.

This is not a love song, this is not a fun song.
This is not a thug song, this is not a drug song.
This is just random pointless song instead.
Just writing whatever feelings decide to creep into my head.

Knowing they exist for whatever purpose.
I might never know when I'm on this surface.

I constantly fail to realize my potential.

Not just with rapping, but just in life.
I often ponder why I only come out at night.
The reason why I'm rapping this emotionless.
Is cause I am, and I'm really just hoping its.

The weather playing with my mood,I'm really missing food.
I miss my body feelin' like it's suppose to.
I'm writing this at 5 A.M. cause I'm afraid to sleep.
My body is rotting away cause I'm afraid to eat.

Combine sleep deprivation with malnourishment.
You'll get a whole new level of worthlessness.
Not to mention the amount of discouragement.
Cause after 2 years you start to think it's permanent.

I'm tired of O.C.D. and I can't wait for the day.
The word Alive is something fucking good to say.
I'm just tired of being in all this damn pain.
I'm sorry, I don't like to complain.

So if you're listening, I have something nice to say.
I truly hope you have a wonderfully amazing day.
I truly hope that somehow you find your way.
And I hope you find a smile on your face.

Doesn't matter who you are, know I fuckin' love you.
And if you were here, I'd love to fuckin' hug you.
