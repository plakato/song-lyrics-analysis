Blow a Cloud Lyrics
by SwizZz.


Now I'mma do something a little different.
You want swag? Well, here it is, stop trippin'.
I gotta keep it real, non-fiction.
I'm here to get loose, let the goose start drippin'.
It's about to go the opposite of up.
While you get it Yung Joc, it's about to go down.

Clock in, go to work, clock out and hit the ground.
Maybe I'm a fool like Dame.
I throw you dick like a pitch no baseball.
I sound rude but you know I don't really mean it.
I'm a nice guy, cavalier, ?
Now get your shovel on if you dig me.
Take a couple shots, spin around, get dizzy.
Put your camera on flash like titties.
Take a picture now, cause we're 'bout to get busy.

I'mma let the dog go, I'mma let the cat loose, We about to get wild.
I'mma show you how to rock it right here, make it crack with a brand new sound.

Blow a cloud and toss it back like yeah x4.

Blackberry, black hat, black tee.
Black beanie, black rag, black jeans.
Black Dunks so yes, I'm mean.
I'm ballin' on a budget but fuck, I'm clean.
My swag's on a hundred, billion.
Thousand, million, damn I lost count.
Somebody hit the lights right now.
It's about to get wild, I'mma turn this bitch out.
Maybe I'mma rock it like Rick.
Rock it like cowboy, rocket like ship.
Fuck around and get thrown like a fit.
Don't got a lot of cream, but your girl's still whipped.
My name's just a little too sharp.
I get her naked like juice, then.
beat it like a heart.
beat it like a heart.
When the sun rise to the sun set like park.

It's 3 o'clock, but you know we don't stop.
I won't sleep, but I'll take a double shot.
There you go, grim hop to the top.
This might put me over but fuck it I'mma rock.
I got a get it mentality.
You say you do this all the time, let's see if you can handle it.
Now put your hand on my trigger.
I can shift back then shoot and clean it up like a swiffer.
See I'm a rider like flow.
And I rolls like royce, nigga tell me what it do.
See I'm a captain on the track like Mo'.
Dippin' in slow mo', pretty lady get a clue.
I know I'm a little off the wall.
But I'm flyer than a zipper don't let your pants fall.
I'm headed to the house so you know just where to meet me at.
SwizZzle it's official I'm a natural afrodisiac.
