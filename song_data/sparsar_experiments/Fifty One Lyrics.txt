Fifty One Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

Once you looked in my eyes.
You knew I'd lost control.
You're taking all my money.
You're wasting all my time.
Fool no more, fool for no one.
5031.
I see no.
Dark below.
6701.
Where's my love?
Where's she gone?
1849.
Lift your sword.
Break the spell.
2491.
A million years.
I'll travel fast.
So please remind me i'm breathing.
Sometimes i forget that i'm living.
Once you looked in my eyes.
You new I'd lost control.
You're taking all my money.
You're wasting all my time.
Fool no more, fool for no one.
2309.
Is fiftyone.
My newest code?
4129.
Can you tell.
Me who's not?
6502.
Always seems.
Never is.
5031.
I see no.
Dark below.
