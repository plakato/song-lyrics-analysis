Try to Fly Lyrics
by 3 Shades of Blue.


Life's a battle.
And I feel a soldier fighting for both sides.
For good and evil, beginning and ending, and deciding everything wrong and.
right.
Close my eyes.
I'm too upset.
The dark is on my right and left.
And I'll admit I'm scared to death.
Thinking of everything coming next.
I guess I forget.
I'll be alone.
And after my death.
Do I begin life inside this soul?
Is there a life at the end of this road?
Maybe I'll know, maybe I won't.
Maybe you care, maybe you don't.
Maybe there's love, maybe there's hope.
Hanging for life at the end of this rope.

And we can swim and we can try.
To live in the ocean.
Fight the tide.
And I can swing my arms and hope to fly.
And if I want to reach the land.
I'll have to reach up and take his hand.
Take his hand.

My tongue's a weapon.
My lungs are guns.
My voice is melting its begun.
On my tongue the battle's one.
Thoughts behind.
The end is shunned.
You can think you're right.
But no matter what you say you're wrong.
Do you believe me?
Or must I expand my vocabulary.
Lyrically denying the lives from physical beatings.
Like trying to stand up for what's right.
His love is keeping my upright.
And I can turn and take flight.
But I will stand and I'll fight.
Fight!
For the battle cuz the end is near.
And I'll admit because above the lies its hard to hear.
Hear the truth.

Ringin' in my ears.
And I was lost but now I'm bound.
And He brought me here.
And to the land where the plan is to live free.
In a momentary world for humanity.
But I'll be honest and focused more on eternity.
Cuz I was part of a new choir but I sing.

And we can swim and we can try.
To live in the ocean.
Fight the tide.
And I can swing my arms and hope to fly.
And if I want to reach the land.
I'll have to reach up and take his hand.
Take his hand.

Have faith tonight.
I'll be there to drive you.
