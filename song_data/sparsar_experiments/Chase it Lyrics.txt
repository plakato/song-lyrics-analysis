Chase it Lyrics
by WRLD.


Cause we got wasted, we got wasted.
And we chased it, we chased it.
Cause we got wasted, we got wasted all the time.
And we chased it, we chased it all night.
Cause we got wasted, we got wasted all the time.
And we chased it, we chased it.

Been trying to work out what we did just the other day.
Don't give it up, don't give it up to care.
Been trying to work out what we did just the other day.
Don't give it up, don't give it up somewhere.

Cause everyone I'll see.
And everyone IÂ´ll know.
They don't care for the places that we go.
Cause we got wasted, we got wasted all the time.
And we chased it, we chased it all night.
Cause we got wasted, we got wasted all the time.
And we chased it, we chased it.

Break.
x4.
We've been running for days without no sleep.
Just to find all the faces in the street.
We've been running for days without no sleep.
Just to find what it is.
