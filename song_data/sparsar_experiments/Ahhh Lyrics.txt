Ahhh Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

Chris Davis.
Uh-huh, yeah, what? Yo, yo.
Aiyyo I seen Run with the chrome spinnin.
Watchin the Knicks in the back of the 6.
Pulled up on the side like, Who's winnin?
Nigga said, Me since eighty-three, get it right.
Politely flashed his Roley, then dipped to the light.
Next night seen him on stage with some platinum shells.
With baguettes on the side that spelled Raising Hell.
I said, Run the crowd yell like you paid 'em well.
Then he said to ask Bert Padell, who the hell?
Oh well - I thought I was done bein impressed.
Until my man called me up and told me listen to Flex.
{Yo yo yo, turn on Flex} I ain't know what to do.
It was like Run was sunnin everybody but then again the shit was true.
MC's must want him gone, hoppin on chrome.
Sayin they the kings, please, you kept the seat warm.
Ain't nobody better than this twenty year veteran.
Even as a Reverend, hotter than you ever been.
It don't really matter who the hell you are.
The fakest of all cats or the biggest of stars.
Tryin to doubt these three, you breakin the law.
They the kings, LEAVIN Y'ALL IN AWE, THAT'S REAL PAW.

Like ahhh, Dunn done did it again.
Ahhh, pad done hit the pen.
Ahhh, man they droppin gems.
Ahhh, the kid's bout stackin the ends.

Run.
Yo, Rev. Run, run the block, swerve the Dat'.
Flow is hot, don't need no gun to cock.
I'm sick of Vidal, your brother tried to get me to fall.
I'm kickin it raw, even in the thick of it all.
Run laps around wack cats, I hate DAT's.
Since way back, made great tracks, I lace raps.
Yo face that, before you catch aluminum bats.
From numerous cats with Run-D.M.C. on they hats.
You ain't gettin no show 'til your album out.
The label don't wanna spend money yo what's THAT about?
No clout, had to settle for a fake amount.
While my catalogue bigger than your bank account.
No doubt, I'm the greatest all time fo' sho'.
Rev. Run comin through and leavin niggas in awe.

CD Yo Run remember that night at the light in the back of the 6?
Run Yeah I was mad the Knicks lost, I got a new whip.
CD Yeah I see, the Bentley Arnage, with the four doors.
CD What is that, for more horse?
Run Nah son, for more tours.
Run I see you've been peepin me for quite some time.
CD Yo my bad.
Run Ain't a thing, nigga I noticed you rhyme.
CD Yo what a nigga gotta do to be more like you?
CD A nigga like me ain't got a clue.
Run First things first I DJ, Run all the rappers.
Run Actors, they want status.
CD But they can't have this.
CD Since Krush Groove you been makin them papes.
CD A lot of rap movies been made since but most of them fake.
Run Thanks for the compliment kid, now jump BACK in your car.
Run It's the Reverend leavin niggas in awe, that's real paw like.
