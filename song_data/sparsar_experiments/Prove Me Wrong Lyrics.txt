Prove Me Wrong Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

You're the only girl.
I kissed this year.
And now it's june and.
You're still here.

But since the end of may.
You've been drifting away.
You've always felt so far.
Move away forget my name.
In the summer you'll be gone.

But you could prove me wrong.
I don't want to be right this time.
Prove me wrong.
I don't want to be right tonight.

I know I always care too much.
It's only been a couple of months.
But I'm so scared you'll leave me here.
Having fun while I stay home.
You won't care that I need you here.
Spend the winter all alone.
