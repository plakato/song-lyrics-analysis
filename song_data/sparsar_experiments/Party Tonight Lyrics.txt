Party Tonight Lyrics
by XO-IQ.

What's up there's something in the air.
It's that feeling when the weekend comes.

Say what you doing way up there.
I think that we could have some fun.
I know this place a week ago.

We're not invited but who cares.
We girls are putting on a show.
There's so much happening out there.
Out there out there.
Do whatever ever.
Be what ever ever.
Dance forever ever ever ever.
So climb out your window.
Cause we're waiting for you.
We're gonna party tonight.
Oh oh oh oh oooh oh oh oh oh oooh.
We'll go crash a party.
Call up everybody we're gonna party tonight.
Oh oh oh oh oooh oh oh oh oh oooh.
Forget what your head says.
We're young and we love it.
We could do whatever we like.
Oh oh oh oh oooh oh oh oh oh oooh.
So climb out your window.
Cause we're waiting for you.
We're gonna party tonight.
Oh oh oh oh oooh oh oh oh oh oooh.
We're gonna party tonight.

We'll turn some speakers up and dance.
Break rules like Charli XCX.
And throw stuff up on instagram.
Set fireworks off in the parks.
And watch them lighting up the air.
We'll crash out underneat the stars.
There's so much happening out there.

Out there out there.

Do whatever ever.
Be whatever ever.
Dance forever ever ever ever.
So climb out your window.
Cause we're waiting for you.
We're gonna party tonight.
