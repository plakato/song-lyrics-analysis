Twi 102 Intro Lyrics
by Twi Teacher.

Benz's that we used to drive at speed.
Money that we use to buy weed.
Chain's around our necks.
Makes the area guy's call us G's.
Because of a Lion Skin Jacket.
People Push Alicia Keys.
That life is what Nas Calls Street Dreams.
You are a villager, from the unknown.
How do they rate or respect you?
You hopped on a plane, for a new life.
What you going to do?
Jeezy didn't give you your style.
But all you got is belief.
So, How the hell did you gain Fan's?
Get into that girls Pant's?
And board chartered planes to France.
And wear African print cloth &amp; Air force Ones?
BIG TEACH.
