Brand New Day Lyrics
by UNK.


Yo... so that's how it goes down.
When I'm beat'n down yo' block.
Ay this for all the haters.
E'rybody who didn't think I was gon' make it, y'knahmtalkinbout.
E'rybody who was down with me.
All my friends, all my family.
From hood to hood, from my hood to yo' hood.
A-Town stand up, yo it's a brand new day.
We gettin new money my nigga, check me out.

Yo, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hey, hey~! Okay now here we go.
Swevin on 24's, blowin on plenty 'dro.
Hey, hey, I came and stole the show.
They thought thet I would blow, and now I get dough.
Every - day, day, I'm on the radio.
I got that killer flow, now everybody know.
My - name, name, name.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Unk.
Nobody in they life, thought I'd go this far.
My momma kept her faith so I pursued as a star.
Now what I say be real, my whole life now has changed.
It's money to the bank, my lil' girl got everythang.
And now we movin up  like Weezy and George.
I might of spent some shit, I used to couldn't afford.
And yes I rock it all, dedications to my dawgs.
And all my friends who stayed down wit'cha boy man this for y'all.
I let the people see  how it can be done.
They watchin end up scopin interceptions so I run.
Now stay up on yo' grind, that's what the big man say.
I told that as advice, I'm shinin everyday.
Now they hear my name like wait  I know that's DJ Unk.
They feel me in they speakers, I'm bumpin in they trunk.
I'm beatin down yo' block, keep you bouncin in yo' seat.
Top quality my sound, DJ Montay on the beat.
DJ Montay on the beat.

Unk.
I'm DJ Unk be cool, be calm and copacetic.
These niggas out here flexin, I told them they ain't ready.
Now what's the competition, they squares just like frames.
I barely here they songs, I barely here they names.
And I hold my head up high, blowin kisses to the sky.
R.I.P. Grandma Bell, love you Grandma ain't forgot.
Nigga now the world's gon' see  how it's supposed to go.
If ten was at the table  five had to go.
And that's just how it go  I soaked up all the game.
We brought it to the world, Big Oomp baby do yo' thang.
Got diamonds on my neck, the neck match the ear.
The ear match the watch, the watch match the gear.
And this'll be my year, Big Oomp we let 'em burn.
Put that in yo' blunt and smoke it, you live and you learn.
Now straight you like a perm, I'm so strong as a bell.
When my Uncle Walt come home we throwin fo's in the air.
Throwin fo's everywere.

Unk.
You see I'm on a mission, success is how it happens.
Yo' boy at Fredrick Doug', I soon well saw what's happenin.
Before there's fingers snappin, you see I paid my dues.
Every flier that you seen, DJ Unk on 1's and 2's.
Two thousand is my crew, just a lil' bit of my past.
Now see he put me on, Big Oomp I meet at last.
Admit it it's a blast, I met up with the camp.
Now go on and bring it back, I got the heart of a champ.
These niggas say they vets, they only gettin slimmer.
They lookin good for breakfast, I ate them up for dinner.
I shoots them in they center, put some holes in your tummy.
I came through bein hard, niggas froze like the money.
Then money started comin, the hoes started shakin.
The collar got to poppin, the haters start hatin.
Some be congratulatin, I looks 'em dead in they eye.
DJ Unk, Southern style, Big Oomp Records let it ride.
Big Oomp Records let it ride.
