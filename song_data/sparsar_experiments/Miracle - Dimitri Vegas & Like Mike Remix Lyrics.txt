Miracle - Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike Remix Lyrics
by The Wolf Pack.

If you're gonna save the day.

And you're hearin' what I say.

I feel your touch, your kiss.

Is not enough.

And if you believe in me.

Don't think my love's for free.

I won't take nothing less.

Than a deeper love.

Lemme tell you.

You know I.

I need a miracle.

I need a miracle.

It's more than physical.

What I need to feel from you.

Lemme tell you.

You know I.

I need a miracle.

I need a miracle.

It's more than physical.

What I need to get me through.

I need a Miracle.

I need a Miracle....

Tell me that you understand.

And you take me as I am.

You'll always be the one.

To give me everything.

Just when I thought noone cared.

You're the answer to my prayers.

You lift my spirits high.

Come on and rescue me.

Lemme tell you.

You know I.

I need a miracle.

I need a miracle.

It's more than physical.

What I need to feel from you.

I need a miracle.

I need a miracle.
