Permanent Vacation Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


You say that I'm too complicated, 
Hung up and miseducated 
I say 9-to-5 is overrated. 
And we all fall down. 
I can't sleep cause my mind keeps racing. 
My chest hurts cause. My heart keeps breaking 
I'm so numb and I can't stop shaking 
And. We all fall down. 
 
Frustration desperation, 
They say I need some kind of medication: 
Situation, no motivation, 
Destination permanent vacation, 
 
Hey, I'm doing fine 
And. I know I'm out of line 
So. Let'S sing this one more time. 
It goes destination. Permanent vacation 
_Na na na na na na __na_, 
 
A voice, says We're coming through the speaker. 
They can't make me a believer. 
I know I'm an underachiever 
And, we're all so proud. 
And watch out. I think we're going under 
Right now you're, just another number 
Get out the system's in the gutter: 
And we're all so proud, 
, 
Frustration desperation. 
They say I need some kind of medication: 
Situation, no motivation, 
Destination permanent vacation, 
 
Hey, I'm doing fine 
And. I know I'm out of line 
So. Let'S sing this one more time. 
It goes destination, permanent vacation, 
Hey, I'm doing fine 
And. I know I'm out of line 
So. Let'S sing this one more time. 
It goes destination. Permanent vacation 
_Na na na na na na na_ 
_Na na na na na na na_ 
 
Congratulations your imitations

_Congratulations your imitations

Corporations calculations
