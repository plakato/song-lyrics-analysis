Regular Lyrics
by ZMoney.

That's on the regular....
On the regular.
I'm not a regular....
I be cashing bruh.
I be swagging up....
Swag.

I done got so used to this, just happens on the regular.
I don't fuck with half these chicks cause half these chicks is regular.
Hustle on the regular, got good on the regular.
I'm dealing dope, I only sell to niggas I see regular.

I done got so used to this, just happens on the regular.
I don't mess with half these chicks cause half these chicks is regular.
Hustle on the regular, smoke good on the regular.
I'm dealing dope, I only sell to niggas I see regular.

The Louis belt is regular, the Gucci belt is regular.
That Fendi with them Bally's nigga, give it to me regular.
True Religion head to toe, just feeding off them regulars.
Whores chicks and ? on my trench like them the regular.
My bitch come from Afghanistan, we ship that on the regular.
I be smoking, puffing, choking, he be smoking regular.
My car ain't nothing regular, foreign ain't damn regular.
The way my shit's teared up two seats, my shit ain't nothing regular.

I fuck her on the regular, her boyfriend no competitor.
Its not that he's a nobody or he was just a regular.
Forreal let me tell you whats regular, Benz truck ain't regular.
Riding in a foreign, pussy riding in the regular.
100K that's regular, connect know I'm a regular.
Someone up on dump and still I cash out on the regular.
My car is taking 93, his shit taking regular.
Pony cuff a bad bitch to fuck her on the regular.

? over sin, shit these devils is the regular.
My ? all-white, so I'm really nothing regular.
My bitch ain't nothing regular, the ass gave me regular.
I still keep it cocked through the car on the regular.
My gun even regular, It don't come like this regular.
Got shooters on the regular so shout out to my regulars.

Bitch I'm onto you, we popping pussies on the regular.
