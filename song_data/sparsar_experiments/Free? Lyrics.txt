Free? Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.

Produced by Neguim Beats and LZ.

Laaa Da Daa.

The world that I know has broken its choke-hold.
On me and says that I'm free.
But who's ever truly free but the dime and time.
I don't know. I don't know.

We're slaves to die.
By the hands of time.
By the hands of love.
C'est La Vie.
We're all a slave to something or someone.
My friend, how free are you?
How Free?
