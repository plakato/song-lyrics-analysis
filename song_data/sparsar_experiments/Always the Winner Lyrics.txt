Always the Winner Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Always the winner, baby.
You're always the center, baby.
But don't you ever get lonely at night.
When the clouds have gone away?

It's always.
You're showing her the lady.
Always the lady.
You're full of.
Yourself, you know.
Gone crazy.

There was a time when you cared for their hearts.
And the need to show them love was tearing you apart.

But you changed, you know.
Become the star of the show.
Now you've got nothing to give;.
Where is the truth you once lived?

You're just lonely.
Don't you feel lonely?

Turn out the spotlight, I'm tired. Turn out the spotlight.
My mind will die, Lord, I'm crying.

Oh, I'm to turn my gaze back, Lord, to you.
You're the only one who knows me.
Just mold me back to you.
