Dumps Lyrics
by Wonder Broz.


Dumps, like a truck truck 
Thighs like what what 
Baby move your butt 
Baby move your butt 
Dumps like a truck truck 
Thighs like what what 
Baby move your butt 
Baby move, your butt 
 
Bounce it like a finished song 
Booty. So big can't see the thong 
She. Make that thing: go'round, and'round, 
Up and down dip, ma dip, ma 
Oh wow, I'm your fan, 
On, the back of the truck like a garbage man 
Get it like Indy, don't use those hands 
Jump behind the dump start yiking uh 
Grab on hold tight 
Baby, not a Rookie she, the pro-type 
Baby, not a clone. She, the prototype, 
Baby, not alone. She got me right, 
That, be true in the middle of the function, all eyes on you 
The whole spot circle want to see what it do. 
Got these niggas like wow. Now they stuck like glue. Ah 
 
Dumps, like a truck truck 
Thighs like what what 
Baby move your butt 
Baby move your butt 
Dumps like a truck truck 
Thighs like what? What 
Baby move your butt? 
Baby move your butt, 
 
She move it like a strip, tease 
 Lem me see you break it down, break it down for me, 
Call her a freak skills on point. She, the top vine of the week, 
Shake shake shake them dumps. 
Booty rattlin, like the bakes in the trunk 
Imagine how it look when she run 
Baby got back. You could tell from the front uh 
I-I-Imma hop up on ya, 
Ride or tight nigga. I was raised in California 
Ain't nun. Scary'Bout me, you can get da-da-da, don't cross! That T 
She is truly amazing. Booty score points. It needs it's own 
Baby, not shy. She needs no persuading 
She know she fly careless about the hating 
 
Dumps, like a truck truck 
Thighs like what what 
Baby move your butt 
Baby move your butt 
Dumps like a truck truck 
Thighs like what what 
Baby move your butt 
 
Dumps like a truck truck 
Thighs like what what 
Baby move your butt 
Baby move your butt 
Dumps like a truck truck 
Thighs like what? What 
Baby move your butt
