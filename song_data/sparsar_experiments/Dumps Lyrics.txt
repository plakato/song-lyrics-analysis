Dumps Lyrics
by Wonder Broz.


Dumps like a truck, truck.
Thighs like what, what.
Baby move your, butt.
Baby move your, butt.
Dumps like a truck, truck.
Thighs like what, what.
Baby move your, butt.
Baby move your, butt.

Bounce it, like a finished song.
Booty so big, can't see the thong.
She make that thing go 'round and 'round.
Up and down, dip ma, dip ma.
Oh, wow, I'm your fan.
On the back of the truck like a garbage man.
Get it like Indy don't use those hands.
Jump behind the dump start yiking, uh.
Grab on, hold tight.
Baby not a rookie, she the pro-type.
Baby not a clone, she the prototype.
Baby not alone, she got me right.
That be true, in the middle of the function all eyes on you.
The whole spot circle want to see what it do.
Got these niggas like wow, now they stuck like glue, ah.

Dumps like a truck, truck.
Thighs like what, what.
Baby move your, butt.
Baby move your, butt.
Dumps like a truck, truck.
Thighs like what, what.
Baby move your, butt.
Baby move your, butt.

She move it like a strip tease.
Lemme see you break it down, break it down for me.
Call her a freak, skills on point she the top vine of the week.
Shake, shake, shake them dumps.
Booty rattlin like the bakes in the trunk.
Imagine how it look when she run.
Baby got back, you could tell from the front, uh.
I-I-Imma hop up on ya.
Ride or tight nigga I was raised in California.
Ain't nun scary 'bout me, you can get da-da-da, don't cross that T.
She, is truly amazing, booty score points it needs it's own ?
Baby not shy, she needs no persuading.
She know she fly, careless about the hating.

Dumps like a truck, truck.
Thighs like what, what.
Baby move your butt.
Baby move your butt.
Dumps like a truck, truck.
Thighs like what, what.
Baby move your butt.

Dumps like a truck, truck.
Thighs like what, what.
Baby move your, butt.
Baby move your, butt.
Dumps like a truck, truck.
Thighs like what, what.
Baby move your, butt.
