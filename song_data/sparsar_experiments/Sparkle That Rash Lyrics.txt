Sparkle That Rash Lyrics
by Vogue.

He was born from a crystal womb. 
He was adorned in the crystal 
Sparkle that rash. The camera is rolling 
Jewel those hives 
We're watching through the cracks in the walls, 
 
Lights, Camera Action; 
When, you crave, medicine, 
Lights, Camera Action, 
Spread, the gem infection 
 
Joshua Joshua. Oh give us a thrill 
Joshua Joshua, I'm the one that hid your pills. 
Do. You ever feel alone 
Do. You ever feel all alone. 
 
Act one you're screaming as the curse kicks in 
Terrified as your hands start the shimmer and sparkling 
And. It spreads through your veins and like stone. Your blood hardens 
And, you sratch, and you pick at the sickly spots, blossoming 
 
Don't, try to fight it. If you peel them off your skin 
They grow in thicker like a bead of diamond 
Well, sparkle that rash boy jewel, those hives boy, 
We, are hungry for your suffering
