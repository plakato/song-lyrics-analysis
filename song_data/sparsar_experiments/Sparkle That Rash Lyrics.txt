Sparkle That Rash Lyrics
by Vogue.

He was born from a crystal womb.
He was adorned in the crystal.
Sparkle that rash the camera is rolling!
Jewel those hives.
We're watching through the cracks in the walls.

Lights! Camera! Action!
When you crave medicine.
Lights! Camera! Action!
Spread the gem infection.

Joshua Joshua, oh, give us a thrill.
Joshua Joshua, I'm the one that hid your pills..
Do you ever feel alone?
Do you ever feel all alone?

Act one you're screaming as the curse kicks in.
Terrified as your hands start the shimmer and sparkling.
And it spreads through your veins and like stone, your blood hardens.
And you sratch and you pick at the sickly spots blossoming.

Don't try to fight it if you peel them off your skin.
They grow in thicker like a bead of diamond.
Well sparkle that rash boy, jewel those hives boy.
We are hungry for your suffering.
