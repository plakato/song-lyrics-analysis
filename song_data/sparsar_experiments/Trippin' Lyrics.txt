Trippin' Lyrics
by Big Season Muzik.

.
What's up, baby, why you acting all funny and shit.
.
Why you don't trust me, when I hit the clubs with my homies/We keep on fighting about you being lonely.
You don't care about us, you just want my money/Sometimes, I be fucking some honeys.
You don't want to have sex in the bed/On my side, you trying to look for some.
bread.
You be losing your mind like a psycho/Trying to act like a big ego.
Buying you bugatti, gucci and diamonds/Go all around the world, relax at the islands.
Always taking you on a first class flight/After that, me and you end up in a.
fight.
We was like the birds and bees/Now we ain't nothing, but enemies.
We used to do a lot of hugging and kissing/But, everyday girl, you always.
tripping.
.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
.
Why you gotta be so naive for no reason/Playing games with me, my heart is full of passion.
Everytime you gotta be so rude/When you come and see me, you not in a mood.
Wearing tacky ass dresses and them high ass heels/By the way, you don't give a.
fuck about how I feel.
You said I'm wack, my songs ain't real/Like R. Kelly says, it pays the.
bills.
Selling my beats, got the cash and the fame/You ain't go no job, while I'm in.
the rap game.
Always going shopping, spending all of my cash/Everytime, you won't let me.
tap that ass.
What I brought for you, everything is mine/You just a girl, who wasting my.
fucking time.
We used to do a lot of hugging and kissing/But now all the time, girl, you.
always tripping.
.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
.
You acting like there's no love between you and me/You wouldn't have shit, if.
it wasn't for me.
You be waiting at my crib while I'm at the studio/You don't live with me, you.
live in a condo.
I bought diamonds, pearls, dresses and cars/The reason why you got those cause.
I'm a rap star.
I thought you was my queen, my pretty angel/Right from start, I knew you was.
trouble.
I cancel your credit cards, broke all of your jewerly/I felt like I was in hell, because you was crazy.
I was stupid for getting with you/What the fellas said about you was true.
You out of my life like Mike/Since you gone, you need to take a hike.
We used to do a lot of hugging/Now we done, cause girl, you always tripping.
.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
Girl, you always tripping.
.
Yeah, back in full effect,.
