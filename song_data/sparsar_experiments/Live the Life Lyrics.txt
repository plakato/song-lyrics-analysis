Live the Life Lyrics
by Ruste Juxx.


Hm-hm, hm-hm.
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen.
I bring to you, live from Kingston Av.
Crown Heights best M.C.
Rustee J., a road dog, what?

Rustee Jux.
Niggas wanna live the life, scared to die to death.
Either pass me the liquor, or supply the meth.
Cuz ain't nuthin like gettin drunk and high from bless.
One wet the throat, one dry the breath.
But yo, I can see clearly now that the rain is gone.
See the Pharaoh Don, brain is strong, now he trainer's long.
Interpretatin entertainers form, to explain his song.
To the known population, Operation Bang-a-thon.
The science is, my alliance is ultimate.
Hip hop revoltin it, reckin the cult or click.
The nastiest rapper couldn't even hold my crown.
Cuz if he could, then they would of been told by now.
Simply, I'm a rap mentor, schoolin my proteges.
Control the stage, in the spotlight of solar rays.
Black hood fatigue, low top Puma's, polar beige.
Double barrel mic position like a hula gauge.
Murder half ya staff with just half a paragraph.
Then behold the rage, take a step back, fold the page.
Now you so amazed cuz I call shots and throw the jays.
When I die older age, God'll have my soul appraised.
The nastiest, I grafted and mastered this.
And just when you thought you heard the last of it, there's one after it.
It's not about drugs and murder or things of that nature.
Ya self claim legends, mob impersonator.
Nigga this, nigga that, I figure that's your limit.
Smoke weed, bust a gat, heart and soul all in it.
You stoled an image, my brainstorm rain til finish.
After thin hits, nastiness name still diminish.
When the days blews dawn, as the phase moves on.
The eighty five wit skid rose, CD on, illusion.
He equals MC squared, and I is he.
G Cypher Divine, born free, V.I.C.
Who mastered the art, grafted the chart.
So all you're throne women's gon have to depart.
On behalf of the scientifical mathematical.
Unmythical, Asiatic true rapper, whose ready to bust a rhyme.
When disaster strike, it's like the return of Cee-Lo.
Or Wrath of Dice, right now, I'm half of Christ.
But in my afterlife, I be fully Allah and you're still half as nice.

Ruck.
Peep the way it's goin down right?
I be the Ruck, that's my man Rust' from Crown Heights.
Sound tight, like when the pound strike, the clown type....
Assholes!! Word up, I can't even, knowhatimean?
Word up, you touched it too hard ... fuck it it's your thing.
Rustee Jux, word up, MFC, word up....
Crown Heights niggas, Brownsville niggas, worldwide....
