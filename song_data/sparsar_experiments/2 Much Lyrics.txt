2 Much Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


All this time.
Too damn high.

Rich Rollski....

All this time, I'm thinkin' that.
I'm just, too damn high.
But the truth is, thinkin' about you.
I've been thinkin' about you.
Been thinkin' about you.
Been thinkin' about you - too much.

Can I hit it one more time?
Can I hit it one more time?
Bitch stop playin' cuz you know that pussy mine.

Yea this bitch fine but you is on my mind.
When I'm fuckin her.
Girl you know me, I ain't lovin' her.
I'm thinkin' bout you when I'm fuckin' her.
Girl I'm feelin you wen I'm touchin' her.

Why we gotta love from a distance baby?
I just wanna fuck this instant baby.
You ain't got to, but listen, baby.
Who you fuckin' lately, got me goin' crazy.

Let me hit it, let me hit it.
Baby bet a nigga miss you too much!
Pussy bomb I salute don't need a crew cut.
We could jump in the 60, kick ya shoes up.
Girl you know you bomb, call it Baghdad.
Make the city go boom when that ass clap.

When you throw it in a circle I'ma ?
Holup, fucka bitch - where the racks at?
Look all this time, punk bitch sittin here tryna act like she mine.
All this time, nevermind fuck a bitch, I'm about to roll a dime.

Tell me somethin', everytime I see you, babygirl you be frontin.
Too damn late too damn fly, everything about ya girl oh my.
My, my, girl don't stop, doin what you're doin.
Cuz you know I gotta watch.
You the top model baby girl you're on my clock.
If I gotta work for you, girl I won't stop, wassup.

Wassup, wassup, wassup.
Girl you're too fine, too fine.
