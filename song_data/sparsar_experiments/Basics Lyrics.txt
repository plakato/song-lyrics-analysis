Basics Lyrics
by Unlimited.


See im no basic chick.
Nothing like these basic chicks.
Steady running round doing basic shit.
Im bout my cake N shit.
Act crazy ? yeah its by waist and shit.
Thought there was no competition till i stepped out on the plate and shit.
Now you twenty four seven on your hating shit ?
But thats basic shit.
Well expected from ah basic bitch.
But you bout your cake too.
Oh , but only when you taking flicks.
Im talking instgram... instaFAME.
You'll do anything just to get the fame.
You got ya camera in mirror striking a pose.
Got ya ass all out.
Yeah thats the way to go.
But thats you and i respect it.
Cause your ah basic , of course its WELL expected.

But In my life i will make ah change.
Never wanna be like you basics.
Doing anything just to get the fame.
Cause im unlimited , yeah thats what they call me.
My time is limited.
But my dreams ... yeah they soaring.
They say the sky is the limit.
Fuck that im reaching for the stars.
The sky can't buy you fancy cars.
