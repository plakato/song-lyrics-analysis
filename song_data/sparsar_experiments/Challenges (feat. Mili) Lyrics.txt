Challenges (feat. Mili) Lyrics
by Wonder Bred.


The Challenge inside of me: 
Will, it ever break me 
The Challenge inside of me. 
I know it will make me ... 
The Challenge inside of me. 
It will never break me. No 
The Challenge inside of me. 
I know it will make me stronger. 
 
I'm challenged by my rhymes 
I'm, challenged by my pride 
Every time. 
That I want to get on Jimmy Fallon. When I rhyme 
I try to get on the stage 
And. I have to do it Everyday 
Because. A $ AP made that 
And. I have to rap this way back, 
Take it to DJ Premier. This is my debut 
Don't fear come near, come near me quickly, 
And. I have to show you this stab a Spear like Brittany. 
You have to know 
I used to be in rehab yo 
And. I have no 
Shame about that 
-Because I had challenges and I had to face that crap 
-Because. If I didn't, I wouldn't shape this craft 
-Because. This is how I grow. 
This is how i go in 
And. I flow it like I'm so in to this 
Spiritual movement. 
If, you didn't know, then you haven't heard it get in tune with 
This is a challenge as it challenges me 
And. The challenge is inside inside of me, 
Because. I have to overcome my defects. 
Respect me 
Because, I dissect I de-sect these 
 
Every time that I rhyme with nouns and verbs 
I take around a word and I spin it and I found the nerve 
It makes your nerves twitch. If you heard this bitch 
You can't touch this. I'M Steve-O with the mike 
You know that I'm speaking it right 
Bout to pass it to my girl, 
Cause. She can sing and we bout to change the world 
 
The Challenge inside of me. 
I know it will make me stronger. 
The Challenge inside of me. 
I know it won't be for longer. 
There were times in my life. 
I felt I couldn't survive no 
The times that I had that thought. 
I know it will keep me taught: 
 
It's. Okay, we pass it always 
Rapping in the hallways, 
I walk past, my homies 
And. I have to have the daps 
And, give it to them, always 
Because, there's no reason 
That, I wouldn't speak to them. 
I say I love you even to my homies, the men 
Because. I do not have no shame, 
I'm, not gay, and I don't have a problem with that 
And. I know that every time that I rap 
I could impact 
Anybody like a crack of the earth 
I'm taking the earthquake, make the earth shake 
Every time that I go make my girl break 
Break her back. Take it back way back 
Every time that I rap 
And. I just do it over a DJ Premier track
