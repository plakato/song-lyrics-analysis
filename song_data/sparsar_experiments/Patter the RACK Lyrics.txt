Patter the RACK Lyrics
by ZOOpfish.


Everybody think they can rap.
Dude I just do it better as a matter of fact.
You beat me never, your clatter is wack.
The kid just too clever man, Patter the RACK.
Patter the RACK, yeah.
Patter the RACK.
Too bad so sad here's a pat on the back.
Yup, I'm the one with the fabulous taps.
Now she talking to her friends saying Patter the RACK.

Don't quit your day job, oh don't quit your day job.
Cause your scheming only work for so long until you made off.
To be one those those dudes telling story's like Aesop.
You embarrassed yourself, think it's time to save face stop.
Cause your flows to weak.
And your lyics don't mean shit.
I could flow for weaks.
And my lyrics the meanest.
Kinda smart, but lyrically a genius.
Heard Jimmy Buffet now she all over my penis, please.
This zoo shits a well oiled machine.
I murder the beat then Temme make it clean.
Olivia pope and Associate the scene.
Boy stay Huckin' with it B, 613.
Got 'em shaking like Hakeem, tell 'em in your dreams.
Triple jumped the candlestick and stole the magic beans, Jackass.
Yeah crazy the scene.
Zeta Theta Theta Fetty, no I in team.
Hands up saying A, like YMC.
Can't get to 1st base, look who slide in: P.
Ahead of everything you do, so you finally see.
You hungry? I already 5 + 3.
Millennial Nelly, come and ride wit me.
Compliment the confidence the way I ride the beat.
Cause it's oh so wavy.
P grab the mic and the place go crazy.

Back in days, in my ways didn't get me then.
Now she wanna have dinner get typsy and.
I'll be home in the winner told her hit me then.
Blowing o's like the bros in the Hippy Den.
She'd prefer I stop smoking Weed for a bit.
I told her that I'd prefer her not preferring shit.
Zϴϴ Project, murdered it, you heard of it?
Said no, but she knowing every word of it.
And I just wanna forget you like Cee Lo.
Put the at in frat me and D'lo go beast mode.
Spilling beer and swearing at the kid in pea coat.
He thinks he saw a ghost like meek did on R.I.C.O.
People listen up im bout to preach.
Givin, not in position to teach.
You can bottom fill your basket but you know the best peach.
Is only just outta your reach, don't be afraid to reach.

Everybody think they can rap.
Dude I just do it better as a matter of fact.
You beat me whatever your clatter still wack.
The kid just too clever man, Patter killed that.
