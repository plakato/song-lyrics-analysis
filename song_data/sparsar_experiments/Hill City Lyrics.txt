by ZOOpfish.


Sick party don't sip Bacardi.
Man, that shit gon' be death of me.
Chug liquor get drunk quicker.
Man, that shit gon' be death of me.
Sick flow, tryin to dough, then get mo till the death of me.
Six hoes get sick of those got six more my bench is deep.

Man, that shit....
Zϴϴ.
Zeta Theta Theta motherfucker, go.

pfish.
She think she wanna wedding ring, she ain't even get a ring ring.
Zoos at where the brews at boy slingin back some yuenglings.
Ride through right by you, I'm with a fly Jew from. sing sing.
We don't know her name, I'll say she's uhhhh. ting ting.
Rolling in the whip I hit that dip like see ya.
Oh you got them hips you got them lips i see ya.
Green stay on my head ch ch ch ch ch chia.
Sorry for the wave until you get the re-up.

Go ham as I honey glaze yo bitch face, I'm not kidding.
Eighth of shrooms and a tab of acid like WHEW, I'm tripping.
In the club I'm Pimpin.
Smoke all day like I'm Chillin it.
All these hoes try to warm my heart but I'm cold blooded, reptilian.

pfish.
I sip dirty' like I ain't worried.
Cuz Your team heard they.
Overrated.
Zoo's curry, yeah you heard me.
Mad hits early that's. A, understatement.
Now I'm waiting, on..., zoo drew.
Send new new, I might just go off.
New clothes, I spent less dough, I got ya'll froze like ya.
Olaf.
Got a fine honey, she's mine buddy ya gutta stop dummy with the.
Staring ott her.
Portions alone.
Know the scorers stoned, and the source is POT...ion.
Like harry potter.
You be scaring others, but not me, cause you copy, my crazy style.
My spots yours, when I'm done poppin, but that's gonna probably take a while.
