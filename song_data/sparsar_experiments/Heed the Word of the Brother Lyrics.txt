Heed the Word of the Brother Lyrics
by X-Clan.


Exist in a state of Vanglorious.
As we are protected by the red, the black, and the green.
Heed the words of the brother.
Sissy!

Letters to words.
Word to phrase.
The paragraph.
Heed math as 'J begins class.
Science of past is now brought to the rhyme fix.
From the scrolls, straight to the verb stick.
Gods to gods from gods to man.
Many kings, many leaders.
A fist from a hand.
They call me militant.
Now what does this mean?
Do I carry a gun ?
Like the army scene?
With the cause I'll never pause.
As simply as the brother.
Raise the flag, raise the colors.
Red, black, green, with the key.
The difference.
Words make a way in the world in an instant.
Living to die and I die to live again.
360 degrees...comprehend.
A man getting stronger 'til he's man no longer.
Unearthly state makes the time seem shorter.
Forever radiant.
Awareness brought for the One.
Open eyes, strong sun.
Practice and preach.
Stand about what I teach.
So you all stand starvin' as I start to unleash.
Verbs of power.

Great blackness brought from the genesis.
Won't exist 'til.
armageddon is a witness.
The originals built the Earth.
Why must there be aggression.
To learn a basic lesson?
Quite majestic, stern within reality.
A juggernaut when you tamper with mentality.
I wear a crown, extension and dimension of a brain cell.
Bringin' hell to the sellouts.
Forever tangled web we weave.
Always tryin' to obtain, no attempt to achieve.
Descendents of kings and queens, I'd like justice.
Never potential, caught up in the measure?
Jealousy of what are we.
Becomes tendency for their thievery.
Alright, cool, but no need to pull a trigger.
Cause that's a fool.
I get my ? like ? stool.
To produce the words that they drool about.
It's another way of checkin' out these sissies.
Who may try to extinct my principality.
But of course they're not havin' me?, madness.
From beginning, I'm the end, observe me:.
Ignorance is not a trend.
So as I beckon for few seconds.
Pull the reins, and heed the words of the brother.

Funk is a force I exert.
Egyptian, African, now I'm on the Blackwatch.
Check my sundial, circle as a ?
I can catch a shadow as the moon reflects the sun.
Creator's eyes make a path to brother one.
So now I walk softly and carry a big stick.
A verb stick, so you natives seem to lick.
J brings the funk and spreads jam to the wheat bread.
In the funk of this, one vanglorious.
Unearthly resistance, strong with persistance.
Grand verbalizer.
kicks this.
Tribal connection.
Pyramids witness the funk bearer.
Vibe sharer not the error?
Brother is balanced like the scales of Thoth.
I knew? that my demand makes stone seem soft.
Corrupts all systems, positive poison of me.
Some call it ?,.
it's a key.
Black is a color, while blackness state? of a mindstate.
But how many of you think?
Today Brother J.
can find the better way, so be it.
Plan it down and.
make it stay.
I serve a purpose.
Yet I am not the G.I. Joe, I am the Brother.
Yo I can never ? a fist.
?
Step to the mic and stage area.
As I drop the science that breaks the clock? barrier.
Words of old make me more than a beginner.
The key opens knoweldge and plays as an antenna.
Americana man, Africana brother.
Don't forget the land cause the birth is from the Mother.
A vibe is in place, obtained and discovered.
Tune in your audio, and heed the words of brother.

Professor X.
Yo Aristotle, Plato, Socrates.
Step off!
