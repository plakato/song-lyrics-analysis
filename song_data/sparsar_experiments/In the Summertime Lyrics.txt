In the Summertime Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

In the summertime.
I don't know if the stars were aligned.
We stumbled onto something we would like.
And I'm afraid I lost the words tonight.

And in your summer dress I was holding you.
But you were holding less.
It's not the words it's the ones you stress.
I'll love you is I love you just don't love me less..

And once in a while.
I know our hearts beat out of time.
And once in a while.
I know they'll fall back in line.

And in the summertime.
I don't know if the stars were aligned.
We stumbled onto something we would like.
I'm afraid I lost the words tonight.

And when we're middle-aged.
You'll tell me I loved you like a renegade.
And how I say the things that make you sway.
And mostly told you you did the same.

Once in a while.
I know our hearts beat out of time.
And once in a while.
I know they'll fall back in line.

Our love is strong.
Our love is strong.
Our love is strong.
While my heart's still pumping blood.
