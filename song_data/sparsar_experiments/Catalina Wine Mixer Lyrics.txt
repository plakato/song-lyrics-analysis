Catalina Wine Mixer Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Hurry up, it's getting late.
I hear him moving, unconscious masquerade.
Kiss me twice before I leave.
The first for the islands.
The second sets you free.
I don't wanna love you always.
It changes with the passing tide.
A love like this should stay buried.
A tourists smile in disguise.
Party's over now.
You turn me inside out.
Your wings clip the moments in the clouds.
Here I am left in the sand.
Tequila sunrise melting in my hand.
I don't wanna love you always.
It changes with the passing tide.
A love like this should stay buried.
A tourists smile in disguise.
I'll remember you.
When our seas lose the blue.
A city girl with dreams you paid to come loose.
You paid to come loose.
You paid to come loose.
You paid to come.
You lose, you lose, you lose.
