Red Lyrics
by X.E.X.


Rainbow skies.
I dig this flight ya.
I'm way too high.
To taste my lows.
Cuz i'm rainbowed.
And i Love the show.
Ya nice and slow.
I lose control.

Rainbow Nights.
I Love this vibe ya.
I'm way too fly.
To taste my lows.
No halo.
Cuz I'm good at bad.
And i'm bad at good.
Baby - oh ya!

RAINBOW NIGHTS OH NO!

I'm drownin.
I think i'm dreamin.
I must be on somethin.
But that something ain't you.
It's tasting good.
Rainbow food.
No excuse.
I'm just in the mood.

The darker the better.
I still see your figure.
And I love the danger.
I love the thrill.
I'm kinda ill , but.
I love the thrill.
Lets go downhill.

I'm hungry, I'm thirsty.
Sin is filthy, yet tasty.
We're on this diet.
So please be quiet.
Don't make a sound.
Else we'll be found.

Trippy Game.
That's all we crave now.
Wonderland.
Is our new world now.

I don't do drugs.
It's just my brain.
I Blame Chromesthesia.
Fuck Synesthesia.

In a world of my own.
All the flowers.
Would have very extra special powers.
They would sit and talk to me for hours.
When I'm lonely in a world of my own.

There'd be new birds.
Lots of nice and friendly howdy-do birds.
Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds.
Within that world of my own.
