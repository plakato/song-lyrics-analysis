We Are The Ones Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

I consider my life worth nothing to me.
If only I may finish the race.
And complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me.
The task of testifying to the Gospel of God's grace.
Now I know that none of you whom I have gone.
About preaching the Kingdom will ever see me again.
Therefore I declare to you that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
For I have not hesitated to proclaim the whole will of God.
Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock.

Be shepherds of the church, of God, which He bought with His own blood.
I know that when I leave savage wolves will come in among you.
And will not spare the flock.
Even from your own number men will arise.
And distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.
So be on your guard.
We are not the wolves at the gate, we are the ones who face them.
Acts 20:26-32; Luke 10:3; Matthew 7:5, 10:6.
