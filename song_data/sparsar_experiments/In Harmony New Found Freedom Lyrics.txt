In Harmony New Found Freedom Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Does correlation imply a true cause.

Self absorption.

And self importance.

Or am i destroying myself.

By asserting the self.

Safer is ignorance.

Used i'm sure.

You'd find a way around.

If only heart knew this weight on her breast.

Try to change.

But i don't and only heart knows this waste of her breath.

Drifting and dealing.

With diamond cut eyes.
