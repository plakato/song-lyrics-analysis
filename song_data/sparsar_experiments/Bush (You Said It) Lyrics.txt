Bush (You Said It) Lyrics
by 57 Pixels.


I tried grabbing life by the horns.
But the horns had thorns.
And now I adore more than I ever wanted to.
And I think about what the fuck to do.
Nothing's new, everyone wants to chug a few.
Or suck a dude, luck be to..you.
Time's on full blast, while my feet remain at standby.
Smoke that good hash, who said human's can't fly.
Straight from a bull's ass, chastity in a tramp's life.
I should of dashed, nah homie that's a damn lie.
I feel like I'm killing it but just then.
I hear all these girls screaming for someone named Justin.
Put me down for awhile, but just when.
I said fuck it, live life to just win.
I'm grabbing this game with charm; it's lustin'.
Someone new and improved to start crushin'.
Competition in reality; fuck dreams.
Happiness not prestige is what I'm wantin'.
Rapping to me is like a boat to a captain.
I put my heart and soul into it for it to happen.
This reality is one to be lasting.
But it seems no one wants me to be yapping.
The fact beams me back to when I wanted to do acting.
Did band instead and decided to play sax, see.
That took time away from me and my friends, g.
I mean time away from me and dead ends, g.
High school has been no different.
People thinking renown can't make you ignorant.
A lot of y'all probs think I spoke mad gibberish.
Hate on this song but I know you still feel it bitch.
