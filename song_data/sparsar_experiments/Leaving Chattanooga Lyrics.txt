Leaving Chattanooga Lyrics
by Wrinkle Neck Mules.

Oh, you're never gonna find me.
Up Lookout Mountain down in Tennessee.
Think I better cross that line.
Leaving Chattanooga behind.

Down in the valley people all the same.
I turned 12, changed my name.
Dropped my accent and hopped a train.
You're never gonna find me no more.

I was too young to fight, but I took my turn.
Flying in the belly of a big iron bird.
At 30,000 feet, I saw the world.
You're never gonna find me no more.

Back in the soil I became a spy.
Working for Hoover and the FBI.
Rolling undercover with aces high.
You're never gonna find me no more.

Then they sent me down south.
To the Sunshine State.
If you got a hostage, I negotiate.
Can't tell ya' where I'm goin'.
Be home late.
You're never gonna find me now more.

No, you're never gonna find me.
Up Lookout Mountain down in Tennessee.
Think I better cross that line.
Leaving Chattanooga behind.

From the Tennessee Valley to the D.O.C.

Oh, hiding up yonder in Germany.

I left Tunisia at the break of day.

And I landed in the water down in Tampa Bay.

No, you're never gonna find me.
Up Lookout Mountain down in Tennessee.
Think I better cross that line.
Leaving Chattanooga behind.
