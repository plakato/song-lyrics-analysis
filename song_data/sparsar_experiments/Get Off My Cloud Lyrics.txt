Get Off My Cloud Lyrics
by The Union.

Drain me and degrade me.
But keep me within our reach.
You love me as you hate me.
Never practicing what you preach.
Get off my cloud.
My life's just fine without you.
Get off my cloud.
Your world is on the ground.
You blow me away.
How can you be so stupid.
There's no room up here anyway.
Judge me then you hang me.
Never hearing a word I said.
Oblique and confusing.
Are the thoughts you put in my head.
Get off my cloud.
My life's just fine without you.
Get off my cloud.
Your world is on the ground.
You blow me away.
How can you be so stupid.
There's no room up here anyway.
And now you're falling.
Back where you belong.
Yes you're falling, falling.
Back where you belong.
