Swooner Lyrics
by The Zolas.

Miss mythical.
She's like the way they were.
I pass, pass her notes.
And she goes, Oh honey, it's alright.

When the arrows volley down, will you stay with me?
Build a fire out of pages of magazines.
Someone like you don't come around every dynasty.
A swooner, that's what you are.

Top of a class.
Top of a field.
A future it's all the head-hunter's got.
Her name on their lips.
Yeah she's the spine to a body of friends.
That incandescent girl of Incan descent.

When the arrows volley down, will you stay with me?
Build a fire out of pages of magazines.
Someone like you don't come around every dynasty.
A swooner, that's what you are.

Feel my temperature rising.
Like a comet colliding.
Feel my temperature rising.
Feel my temperature, feel my temperature.

When the arrows volley down, will you stay with me?
Build a fire out of pages of magazines.
Someone like you don't come around every dynasty.
A swooner, that's what you are.
