Aint A Thing Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Listen here babe.
Let me tell you how it's gonna be.
Go ahead and try it baby.
You won't last one day without me cause.

You got it bad for me.
Still got a heart for me.
Im just a habit baby you can't break.

You go it bad for me.
Still got a heart for me.
That's just how it's gonna be.
Baby you just wait and see.

You ain't a thing without me.
Sure ain't a thing without me.
Girl you've been struttin' around.
You've been all over town but what does that prove.
I know all about you.

You ain't a thing without me.
Sure ain't a thing without me.

So listen up baby.
Im not quite finished with you.
It would only drive you crazy.
No other lover could do what I do, yeah.

You got it bad for me, still got a heart for me.
Oh you keep searching 'till you realize.
You got it bad for me, still got a heart for me.
That's just how it's gonna be.
Baby you just wait and see.

You ain't a thing without me.
Sure ain't a thing without me.
Girl you've been struttin' around.
You've been all over town but what does that prove.
I know all about you.

You ain't a thing without me.
Sure ain't a thing without me.

You go it bad for me.
Still got a heart for me.
Im just a habit baby you can't break.
You go it bad for me.
Still got a heart for me.
Don't it get hard to breathe.
When you think how good it used to be.

You ain't a thing without me.
Sure ain't a thing without me.
Girl you've been struttin' around.
You've got all over town but what does that prove.

I know all about you.
You ain't a thing without me.
Sure ain't a thing without me.
You ain't a thing without me.

No, no ain't a thing.
You ain't a thing without me.
