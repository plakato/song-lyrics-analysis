Lay With Me Lyrics
by Sworn In.


Dance with me.
I'll make you believe.
Dance with me.
For eternity.
Dance with me.
Oh why can't you see.
Dance with me.
That this is who I'm meant to be.

The devil's kiss.
I stole the devil's little kiss.
And now it's my turn.
To watch it all burn.

Love is the flowers on top of my grave.
Love is the bitter taste of your name.
Love is the way I feel like a slave.
Tell me is love just a game?

Lay with me, tonight, tonight.
I'll dance in your head, alright, alright.
And again and again tonight, tonight.
One more time to feel alright.

Shut up I love this part.
This is where we both fall apart.
You say you like my eyes.
I should've known.
That I'd still feel alone.
I'm always alone.

I don't think I've grown.
This life's just a loan.
So baby let me hear one more moan.
This life's just a loan.
So baby let me hear just one more moan.

Lay with me, tonight, tonight.
I'll dance in your head, alright, alright.
And again and again tonight, tonight.
One more time to feel alright.

What are you supposed to do.
When you can't think straight.
When you can't lift the weight.
When it smothers you until you can't breathe.
Are you supposed to leave?
Well I can't.
I've tried that.
Chewed up and out I was spat.

Bad, bad.
I'm just a bad taste.
Just a fucking waste.

Lay with me, tonight, tonight.
I'll dance in your head, alright, alright.
And again and again tonight, tonight.
One more time to feel alright.
