Fire and Ice Lyrics
by Xeezy.


Some say the world will end in fire, 
Some, say in ice 
From. What I've tasted of desire 
I hold with those who favor fire 
But. If I had to perish twice 
I think I know enough of hate to say that 
For destruction, 
Ice, is also great .... 
And would suffice. 
 
You know I got an English final ... 
I got ta focus 
 
Try fighting a liar as opposed to lighting a fire. 
She got a job, I'm for hire, 
Not doing it Frodo or for the shire 
 
Marry me ..., marry me .
 
On one knee as I ask 
Make this shit ever-last 
My wish is this chick. Have a blast 
In my company
