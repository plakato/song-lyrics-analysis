Fire and Ice Lyrics
by Xeezy.


Some say the world will end in fire.
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire.
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if I had to perish twice.
I think I know enough of hate to say that.
For destruction.
Ice is also great.....
And would suffice.

You know I got an English final.....
I gotta focus.

Try fighting a liar,as opposed to lighting a fire.
She got a job I'm for hire.
Not doing it Frodo,or for the shire.

Marry me...marry me.

On one knee as I ask.
Make this shit ever-last.
My wish is this chick have a blast.
In my company.
&amp; I hope that she never have to run from me.
She stay hungry....
Like con-garess....
And she Curl when ever she up under me.
As I touch her B..O-D-Y.
So what, she's shy.
&amp; don't ask me why.
She chose this guy.
We cop porn,with popcorn while we pron to watch pron till the lights gone.

Heads no tails,as her toe nails,save the whales,waving the sails,till the.
shores see the early morn.
&amp; I was reborn yesterday,thank God I stayed up all night.
She's the only chick in my sight...who gives me insight.

Tell me,please tell me.
What you do,what you do.
Tell me,please tell me.
What you do,what you do.
&amp; if I say I love you,would you love me to.
&amp; if I say please tell me,tell me that you do.
Tell me,please tell me.
What you do,what you do.

Marry me...marry me.

What you do,what you do.

I love you,&amp; I don't say it often.
&amp; I'd probably be in a coffin,coughing softens my emotions.
&amp; I'm coaxing... on you.
Being macho... for who.
&amp; I feel like an ass,an like glass my lass tends to see right through.

My false persona,we'd marry yuh wanna.
The flora to my fauna.
She's the prostitute to my corner.
I'm the Jack her parents Warner.
We still made a winning connection.
&amp; I see her I see perfection.
She's so classy I learned ah lesson.
&amp; I'm often second guessing,if I'm her 1st choice.
She leaves me feeling moist.
Speechless without a voice.
Listen hear,as haters hiss and leer.
In her two eyes,see no fear.
These others girls they selling fruit.
Cause next to you they couldn't compare.
