Track 3 g Lyrics
by '68.

Hey kid, don't listen to them.
We got a long, long way to go.
And yes Death speaks the truth but.
It's imagination that she lacks.

May your response be riddled with truth.
May your responses be nothing but trust.

If trust would be my lover, I'd take her anywhere I go.
We'd mark the wolves of the cities.
One by one.
Until our hands showed their bones and.
For once Love would be immortal.

And the rivers want to speak and.
The deserts sing as well.
I want too.
I want a war.
Maybe it is the end for us but.
I can't stand still.
Make every silence worth it.
