Cosmonaut Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

Young girl can you tell me what you're looking for?
Down this never ending highway.
Wipe your, your tears away.
Listen, hear what I say.
Sitting here with nothing on my mind.
Could you possibly afford the time?
Are we looking for the only cosmonaut?
The only cosmonaut.
Young girl can you tell me where do you go?
Delirious, the only way that you know.
Sitting here with nothing on my mind.
Could you possibly afford the time?
Are we looking for the only cosmonaut?
The only cosmonaut.
The only cosmonaut.
The only cosmonaut.
We traveled far off into space.
No longer part of any race.
All worldly pleasures left behind.
No longer part of our own kind.
The only cosmonaut.
The only cosmonaut.
The only cosmonaut.
The only cosmonaut.
