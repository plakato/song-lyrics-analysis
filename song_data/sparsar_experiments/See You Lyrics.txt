See You Lyrics
by WRLD.


And I've got all the time it seems.
I'd rather see you in my dreams.
And every chance to dance I'll take.
If I can't see you again.

Break.
We could be listening for answers.
Or waiting to be set free.
You came across this moment.
And I'm so thankful you shared it with me.

Take it from me.
We live to be free.
Take it from me.
I want you to see.

Break.
We could be listening for answers.
Or waiting to be set free.
You came across this moment.
And I'm so thankful you shared it with me.

Break.
