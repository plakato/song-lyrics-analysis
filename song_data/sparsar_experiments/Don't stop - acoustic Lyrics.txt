Don't stop - acoustic Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.

I can refresh you so can a holiday.
You got me thinking that we could run away.
You are my ticket out you tell me where and when.
Oh woah.
I take your number said you don't have a phone.
It's getting late now I gotta let you go.
Everybody wants to take you home tonight.
I'm gonna find a way to make you mine.

Don't stop doin' what you're doin'.
Every time you move to the beat.
It gets harder for me.
And you know it, know it, know it.
Don't stop cause you know that I like it.
Every time you walk in the room.
You got all eyes on you.
And you know it, know it, know it.

Got me close now sure I can taste it.
You've got me tongue tied I can't escape it.
I remember what you got the way you push me back.
Oh woah.
Everybody wants to take you home tonight.
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine.

Don't stop doin' what you're doin'.
Every time you move to the beat.
It gets harder for me.
And you know it, know it, know it.
Don't stop cause you know that I like it.
Every time you walk in the room.
You got all eyes on you.
And you know it, know it, know it.

Every day is the same all the games that you play.
Back and fourth round and round I like it this way.

Don't stop doin' what you're doin'.
Every time you move to the beat.
It gets harder for me.
And you know it, know it, know it.
Don't stop doin' what you're doin'.
Every time you move to the beat.
It gets harder for me.
And you know it, know it, know it.
Don't stop cause you know that I like it.
Every time you walk in the room.
You got all eyes on you.
And you know it, know it, know it.
