Close Minded Lyrics
by Vision.


Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
Why dont you listen to this, you might like it.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
This song 'ain't for free, if ya say you don't buy it.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
I'll tell you right now, that im never gunna try it.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
Give me what I want, or there's gunna be a riot.

What am I to do, close minded.

Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
Make no mistake, there's no compromise.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
Just try and see it, through my eyes.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
I'll tell you one more time, that you better keep quiet.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
If it's not punk rock, I'm never gunna like it.

What am I to do, close minded.

You know, everybody's always sayin'.
Your really close minded.
You only listen to one type of music.
You only go to one type of show.
And I say well you know what?
This is the type of music that we grew up on.
This is the type of.
Music that we play, punk rock is our way of life.
It's how we choose.
To live, and everyone else's opinion is worth nothing.
Don't worry.
About what I listen to, worry about your own life.
Cause im not gunna.
Change for you, or anyone.
I can't help it if you dont like it, and it's up.
To me if I don't wanna listen to anything else.
It's what's in our blood.
It flows through our veins.
So save your breath cuz' we're here to stay.

Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
Why dont you listen to this, you might like it.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
This song 'ain't for free, if ya say you don't buy it.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
I'll tell you right now, that im never gunna try it.
Everyone tells me I'm close minded.
Give me what I want, or there's gunna be a riot.
