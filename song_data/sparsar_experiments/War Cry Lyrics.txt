War Cry Lyrics
by The 3rd Kind.


We think too much, and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity.
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in man, cries.
out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of.
despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men.
torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me I say, Do not despair..
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of.
men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the.
people will return to the people.
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you,.
who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think, and what to feel,.
who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men with machine minds.
and machine hearts.
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!
In the 17th chapter of St Luke it is written, The Kingdom of God is within.
man. Not one man nor a group of men, but in all men. In you!
You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to.
create happiness.
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make.
this life a wonderful adventure.
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away.
with greed, with hate and intolerance.
Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
