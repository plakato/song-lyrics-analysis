Come In Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

Knock knock knock knock, come in come in!
Knock knock knock knock, come in come in!
Knock knock knock knock, come in!!
Who's at my door?

MC Serch.
Come in, to my cribbo, no reason you'll say ditto.
No tea and crumpets, not servin you no vitals.
Little one sit, I'll kick to you a fable.
So recline on the recliner put your feet up on the table.
Sable is a fox that's used for coats.
The sable is a fable cause you bought yourself a goat.
Skin all in, so ease up on throttle.
No role model and your life is out the bottle.
The roll of the dice on the corner of the street.
You get beat, on 123rd street.
Done by the system that ain't really sayin nothin new.
Your kids flippin, so now what you gonna do?
Go home, hell no, she don't want you there.
Why need a man or either work when there's welfare?
Oh yeah, another scam see.
The government's way to destroy the family.
See life is a gamble, find the ball under the shell.
HELL NO, I kick two and make the dome swell.
Son, that's the end I hear the doorbell ringin.
And if that's your pops, tell the man to just come in.

* doorbell rings *.
Oh hello dear!
Uahh, good morning...
Very well then.. suppose you come over here!
But first...

Knock knock knock knock, come in come in!
Knock knock knock knock, come in come in!
Knock knock knock knock, come in!
{I came in the door.. - Rakim}.

Pete Nice.
Ask me why I wander on desert plains.
I say the Cactus still grows without rain.
Plain to see from my horse without a name.
I set it off, still things ain't the same.
A case of wasted life, inner city blues.
Goods for hoods from the merchant of grooves.
I move your butts but a question lingers.
I look at my hands, I sees ten fingers.
A finishin touch, much on the TP.
Here the Three-R-D and the blind see.
Why I flipped and why I ain't with the Klan.
Which one you say all truth and.
True indeed, y'all needs a speed knot.
Knothead syndrome, sets off piano drops.
{* Daddy Rich cuts and scratches *}.
So I please, and step with Kool Poppa Sha.
Scopin every skin without a bra.
On the streets, Kurious like Jorge.
Why don't you make like Run and +Pause+?
Flaws in characters, scrubs get done in.
I swing it open y'all, so come in.

Knock knock knock knock, come in come in!
Knock knock knock knock, come in come in!
Knock knock knock knock, come in come in!
Knock knock knock knock, come in come in!
Knock knock knock knock, come in!
Who's at my door?
{I came in the door.. - Rakim}.
{I came in the door.. - Rakim}.
{I came in the door.. - Rakim}.
{I came in the door.. - Rakim}.
