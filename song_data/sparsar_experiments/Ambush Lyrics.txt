Ambush Lyrics
by Swollen Members.


Im Pyschosimatic you might know the static that automatically comes when we.
hit these drums.
All of the underworld sayin here he comes.
To snatch back the crown and thats passed around.
In my fleet we beat the odds, meet the godfathers.
We keep the crowd hotter you speak and why bother.
I automata Fire my style i gotta.
I got a moniker thats volitile its flow torch.
?
?
Im not the type to sit around on bar stools.
Me and the mic we been around since carpools.
And now with the 90's behind me i finally designed the epitamy of grimey.
You can finally wear the sunshine betry me and i'll have you all crying why me.

Ambush, Takin it back to the place we made the name known and theres no.
survival.
Ambush, We never seen this shit comin and we want you to know we still hold.
the title.
We still hold the title, theres no survival y'all should get bide.
We Strike Without Warning, Show no Remorse, We Run the Darkside.

Dangerous and Uncivilized balls brains jaws chains thats how im livin life.
Role Reversal i'll go commercial then go back to underground wit no rehearsal.
Roads are closed cuz boulders rollin, im'a bulldoze and my shoulder's frozen.
Coldblooded and coldhearted im cut throat, im gon finish what i started.
whassup bro.
Redeem my Team raps cap'll regeme, Captain of the makin and happeh machine.
Bossaball bosses you, cut your losses.
Catch what your tossed and im fuckin awesome.
My luck i'll Profit.
Of course im on my own dick its attached can't get off it.
Jack Move Hidin under the Stair Case.
Army Fatigued Strap Gas Mask and Bear Mace.

We Discovered the Brotherhood of the Wolves.
Where we cut em good and feed em to the dogs.
Im involved.
Mysteries unsolved.
The opening groups on cool tell me when its ours.
Im'a treat it like a gymnasium.
Goin 2 times platinum we only play to win.
I can't hold again, Im Spinnin out of orbit.
Im Comin for ya.
If i can plan it like i fought for it.
Metamorphic, Something Metal in my Pocket.
Turn of gum i'll make you knife an slice an eye socket.
Got advice like crock it in tubs.
Got you higher then the drugs that they made in bathtubs.
Ambush'll push thru with muscle.
Push come to shove i got you seein double.
Purest Shock Value my Corps C4's.
Like crawling thru a trench in the 2nd world War.
