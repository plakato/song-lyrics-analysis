Dappens Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Well, it's finally time.
For this makeshift and rhyme.
And misery she hides the unwanted unwind.
And listenin' in colors.
And significant others just by.

And the voiceless debate.
When the clock's face is straight.
Just echoes these pale bathroom walls where I wait.
But all this white silence.
Is better than violence for now.

And for every redressing that.
Discounted blessings.
Seems every lost kid got some diction to guessing.
But back washed malt liquor.
Never tasted much sicker than now.

And the blunt broken poets.
Too uknown not to know it.
Upon their illusions in brains where I stow it.
Here's my hosanna.
Not a moment of plannin' tonight.

Cause heard by this light.
Anything could sound right.
Reflections of truth through the vaccuum night.
But these words are still nothing.
But a bullshit kid bluffing for now.

And still undiscovered.
In a riptide of lovers.
Some someday away we wait for each other.
Where cause is the means.
All my flaws go unseen unlike now.

So I'm calling out to you.
A memory once you knew.
Now seems so deformed, both so wrong and so true.
And I frighten the virtues.
Of a person like you who.
Just wrestles in bed.
With every thought of the head.

If I wake here tomorrow.
I won't be the same.
And I can't let you watch me just wastin' my brain.
But baby be kind to.
What I leave behind anyhow.
