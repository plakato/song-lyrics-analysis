Bang Your Drum Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

The dying light.
Was nearly dead.
By the time we reached the water's edge.

We saw the river beating on the riverbank.
For the way that it held every hard riverbed.
It's cold, it's dirt, it's not for people with uneasy hearts.

But if you're with me on the other side.
Strike up the band, we have survived.

Oh do they beat that drum to get you back home.
Or do they beat it to keep you away.

Don't be surprised at your regrets.
Don't be surprised that the water made you wet.
There's a shallow down river when the water will forgive you.
Soft skin, your lukewarm beds.

Follow me, follow me.
Allow me to play the voyager.

I'll try to keep you as dry as the hollowed out tree that you would be wrapped.
in.
Another man's first.

So take a dive.
Take a dive.
Take it out on the stepping stones that make the water rise.
So take a dive.
Oh take a dive.

Take that hair.
Out of your downed eyes.
While the waves are rain.
And the sun yellow pane.

Do they beat the drum to get you back home.
Or do they beat it to keep you away.

Singing la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

Will you bang your drum to the blazing sound.
Singing la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
Will you turn away?
How can you turn away?
