Tha M.O.B. Lyrics
by Swoop G.

Swoop G.
You can't stop me, baby.
Mobb shit.
You can't stop us, baby..

I put that on the... Mobb.
My here comes the warrior.
Heat from nailin him, yellin out the window when I'm bailin.
What you sellin?
I need some zags, I'm ready to get keyed.
Juss a phase.
If niggas go snag a zag, then we go snatch a sack of green.
Step back and let the heat go attack 'em, so we can see.
Cuz picture my faulty face, fill it up wit drank an clear the space.
Sicker than Waco.
So wicked yo dick will scratch an lay low.
My folks get deep in yo dome plus roll up yo face an I say so.
Leave 'em dangled, severed an strangled.
I put that on the Mobb an my Mobbin niggas will lay low.

They tryin to mug a nigga.
Tryin to put slugs on a nigga.
But I'm lettin a nigga have it, catch this silly rabbit.
What the fuck??!!
Whoooo got dropped?
What the fuck??!!
Yoooou got shot.
I keep my gun on safety.
Cuz niggas hate me.
Gotta retally me, yet they can't penitrate me.
Or fade me.
Got shot two times, bullets grazed me.
Lable me a mental Knuckle Head, bitch I'm crazy.
The Mobb slangs z's like Scarface on keys.
Rollin Lexo's an Benzo's sittin on Gold D's.

I put that on the Mobb.
Slob, or no pussy, I rock pussies.
An after I fuck, I consider the clitoris my pussy.
So do the do bitch, I figure that Knuckle Head an Dru spit.

You bitch.
It's Swoop's shit.
Day by day the blunt walk.
Hamps, chron-chron, Hindu an drunk talk.
I be the wall behind the heater.
Call me yo leader.
Makin niggas go old school like Dan Sever.
Makin Num, Num inbetween 'em ain't no thang.
Dick on hang, slang mo pussy then sunsets on one set can't hang.
Bang-bang, love me to give me skrilla.
Hug me to give me lovely, Mobb love killa, killa.

** -x2.

We Mobb nigga.
Hooride nigga, we drop niggas.
You gettin mobbed nigga.
I put that on the Mobb nigga.

Uh, nigga any bottle drunken.
X-O swallowed, pumpkin.
Head gettin.
Lead spittin an I'm hittin blunts an.
The chefs hittin, on dubb members.
My nigga Num, S-S mean mug niggas, ex-drug deala niggas.
Who love hittaz.
He be the licksta.
he be the the twista.
Like the movies, sock it to me.
Like Rudy Ray Mode, or human tornado.
Nigga I'm groovy.
Break niggas wit the Hong-Kong fuey, plus light niggas up wit the uzi.
I put that on the... paraphanali.
I'm a keep the Cristally in my belly.
I touch mo bread then jelly.
One snap like Fonzarelli, make a bitch sell me.
Pussy until it gets smelly, an then I'm finished.

Got my pistol gripped tightly.
Make you do the right thang like Spike Lee.
Despite the.
Niggas who be takin the M.O.B. lightly.
It might be.
Another case of name loss.
Cuz game cost, for the nigga that stole my butter I'm a show you off.
He coughed.
I opened them lungs like Primetine Mist.
Fuck wit a.
Forehead splitter, wit a clenched fist.
Dismissed.
Off the face of the planet.
Sank like Titanic.
Boy don't panic, I'm juss a Sickaluffa skitzofrentic.
Fuckin bitches that be jockin Oakland game.
I ran it, never leave empty handed.
An the hataz can't stand it.
But can't stop it either.
Behind a 9 millimeter.
I put that on the Mobb you'll be left on a machine greeter.

Niggas wanna get they test on.
Better have they vest on.
Packin a clip full of teflon.
Leavin you niggas stepped on.
Fucked around an got crept on.
Slippin in his 'Stang.
Talkin bad about 3 Times, I had to do my thang.
Mobb shit, wit a pistol grip.
30 officers hit, wit a clip.
When you get stuck on yo door wit a $150 dolla kicks.
An slappin that ass juss like a bitch.
Nigga fuckin wit niggas, don't ya know.
You best believe you fuckin wit soldiers.
That'll chop that ass up, roll in the cut like A-1 Yola.
A-G mutha fuckin E.
Got a Glock an a 3-50.
Niggas better hope like Bob.
That they don't get robbed.
Fuckin wit the Mobb nigga.

**.

Hold up nigga.... Fuck all you niggas that ain't wit this Mobb shit. You.
Wit us or against us. Success is the best revenge.

**.

The Mobb game got us niggas brain hangin like wall paper.
You shouldn't have ran yo mouth about the Mobb at all playa.
All spraya.
Able to rip shit.
An still Eclipse spit, guess our heataz start to come in triplets.
The Oakland edition, where we was raised.
An rolls mutha fuckaz up off the turf that didn't belong.
One phone call, to my roll dog.
I have a roll call to finish.
Niggas brought paraphanalia comin to get ya.
They proper position.
To chop 'em wit street sweepers an Glocks.
Selection wit heataz, an sections to hectic to stop.
Like mad caulkin, an bad cops.
An all this shit that can get yo ass popped.
Or get yo ass shot.
I put that on.
Niggas I rob wit in Eastside California.
Pullin up an puttin the pistol on ya.

Paraphanalia to the Mobb.
We treat yo face like pussy, fuck yo head.
Why did the world distort, potnaz deadly, warfares.
This 'sidal life has got me strapped an sayin, more prayers.
Been down on one knee, hopin that when the killa comes that he don't gun.
Me.
Life is money.
Mind over matter until the death nigga.
Fo life.
I had that P.M.O.B. written across my chest.
I guess.
The mental mandatory got me cleanin up blocks.
For shitty niggas like I'm in the janitorial business.
After droppin a dime niggas will Mobb, many an all.
When the bullet flys many will fall.

T Luni the first to call.
I bet, as applied hearse an casket fo 'em all.
As we Mobb nigga.
