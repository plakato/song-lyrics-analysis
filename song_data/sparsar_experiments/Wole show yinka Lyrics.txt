Wole show yinka Lyrics
by Yung6ix.


KKTBM that's the fam,La Familia.
All this people hating,them dey form,they know who we are.
Everyday they see me,see i'm living like a superstar.
Yes they say i got the kind of swag Wale wants to show Yinka.
Oya,Wole i say show yinka.
Wole i say show Yinka,oh yeah.
Oya show Yinka,Wole i say show Yinka,Alright.
Oya show Yinka,Wole i say show Yinka,oh yeah.
Oya show Yinka,Wole i say show Yinka,Alright.

Ok,Mr nothing turned myself into something.
He from the south but the run the east.
And the west and acts like it's nothing.
Now they say that i'm fronting,Now they say that i'm fronting.
Cause i spend a car up in the club,i wasn't even stunting.
They tell me they love but i don't belive 'em.
They think they the best but someone be decieving 'em.
They up in my face i just turn back and leave 'em.
Ironically speaking that's all i be leaving.
Life is a bitch,it is all that i'm living.
Not like my ex or the house that i leave in.
Not taking shots i just hope you recieve em.
Might just get some babies from fucks i'v been giving.
The one they neglected,never selected.
Hear talk is cheap so i came here and i rented.
You know that i'm even doing better than they expected.
Same girl that used to tell me to leave alone.
Now she's calling me,like a bank she wants me to leave her a loan.
