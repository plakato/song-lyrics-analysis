The Albatross Lyrics
by Wolfman D.

I'm so nasty on the mike.
When I grab that you like.
The way I hand you a vice.
Then jack up the price.
Then they ask if I'm nice.
I leave them with lice.
Suffice it to say.
I'm iller than the dudley death device.

I'm so dope.
I give weedheads the munchees.
Crackheads a bum knee.
I'm banned in 30 countries.
Cause trust me, if you touch me.
I'll rearange your face like.
A plastic surgeon.
Who can't use precision blades right.

You dont beef, yo punk ass.
Need a diet of.
Steamed leafy greens.
Cause you can't ingest this riot.
Of solid beats.
And hot spicy bars of words.
Fuck what you heard, you think you the shit?
I must be 2 turds.

Spittin slurs.
Like a klansman in the fifties.
Cut off your hands.
Cause your mans lookin shifty.
Fuck up your plans.
Unexpectantly precipitate.
You fuckin with the illest artist.
Ever to illustrate.

You worn out.
Like a rag at a laundromat.
You ain't ill.
You just think you're sick like hypocondriacs.
I break your teeth.
You weak like centenarians.
My archives turn rap geniuses.
To librarians.

My rhymes burn like a perm.
I'm like a street chemist.
Lacing my dope rhymes with sherm.
To get them hatin on me.
They try to take me for my bread.
I get the skatin on them.
They style so dead.
I gotta use carbon dating on them.

Hop in the gym.
To practice my rhyme tactics.
I'm lighting em up like match sticks.
I'm grindin em up like cat bits.
To feed to my carnivorous.
Cactus you what you lookin at?
Think i'm crooked, but sane.
I'm straight bat shit.

Crazy like I'm on daisy.
While myrtle watchin me swayin this lady.
I knock her boots.
Then get ghost like patrick swayze.

They askin me bout my plans?
My rhymes hit like gamma-rays.
Stereo tactic.

Precision, I'm on a mission.
To make them mad when they listen.
I'm kickin them in the shins.
To tell the doc, they got 10 in pain.
Then I score 10 in the paint.
To get so hot that you faint.
You tryin to get out the game.
I'm so didactic.

You rang? you got 7 days to live.
But i'm like god to these demons.
Pots and pans to the greens.
If you know what i mean.
Without me, you just mad lost.
You double crossin the masses.
To get your freedom for free.
I'm the albatross.
