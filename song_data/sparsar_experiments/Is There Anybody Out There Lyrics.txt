Is There Anybody Out There Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Got this old feeling that I've met her before.
Might not have meant it but I've said it, I'm sure.
I don't need love, hell, I need her.
Evacuating all my hunger and thirst.
Gave me this power that I don't deserve.
A train could hit me and I wouldn't be hurt.
First time I saw her, I fell off the earth.
Nearly died but didn't blame her.

Is there anybody out there? So beautifully honest, atomic.
Is there anybody out there? I'm breathing cause you are.
Is there anybody out there? So soothing, I want it.
Is there anybody out there quite....

Is there anybody out there quite like you?

I'm going to praise you like a god.
And treat you like my old friend.
Taller than me, why shouldn't she be?
Exaggerating all the freedom in me.
Gave me a power and I'm terrified.
9 more lives and none like her I will find.
Fugitive of hate when my baby is near.
She's got a talent that won't disappear.
