{Ooooh, I got a winner! I think I got a winner!}.
Uh! Uh! Ahh baby, here we go now!

Thrill Pa Dlaya.
Hey baby doll, what's up? 'Scuse the mood, I'm a lil' bit bored.
And normally, I don't try to take girls home after the club.
But you got that flavor ride, and I'm kinda hungry.
Not only that, strictly by myself, sometimes I tend to get lonely.
So let's find this camp, and get a lil' something to eat.
Get back to the 'mote and kick off them shoes so I can rub them feet.
And we both dogs, baby, so we ain't got to joke.
If you're down, I'll get to the car and we can head to the 'mote!

{Let's go to the motel, let's go to the 'mote.
I won't tell if you don't tell!}.
Jay-Ski:.
{Let's go to the motel!} Girl, don't have no shame!
{I won't tell if you don't tell!} How you'll be gettin' that pocket.
Change!
{Let's go to the motel!} Girl, you know the deal!
{I won't tell if you don't tell!} How you'll be payin' that phone bill!

It's the last call for alcohol, baby, so let's leave the club.
I wanna get in the tub and rub-a-dub, cause I'm in the mood for lo-ove ....
You wanted barbecue or mildew, girl, so what you wanna do?
We can go to the Hilton, Motel 6 or get a room at the Peek-A-Boo, uh.
So eat your Wheaties, sweetie, and yo, you can best believe.
Bring your toothbrush, a fresh pair of panties, yo, and that's all you need.
So let's keep it a G thang, , uhh, and please don't go tell.
That you're makin' noise with the 69 Boyz, so let's go to the motel, uhh!

Jay-Ski:.
{Let's go to the motel!} And we can have some fun!
{I won't tell if you don't tell!} How you'll be gettin' them braids done!
{Let's go to the motel!} Girl, don't try to shine!
{I won't tell if you don't tell!} Where you workin' part time!

{Ho-tel, mo-tel, I won't tell if you don't tell!}.
{Ooooh, I got a winner! I think I got a winner!}.

Thrill Da Playa.
Don't holler 'bout, I don't know ya, and you don't know me.
Cause if your booty big, then I'ma learn to dig your personality.
I'm real, though; I ain't fake, heyyy, I want them skins.
And you can bring your big booty buddies too;.
I got a motel full of friends:.
Danny, Tony T, Lemonhead, A.B., Daddy Black and Jay.
You got three more friends?
Well, I do too: the Rottweiler, Rico and DJ M.A.!
We got rooms at the 6, so let's handle our business.
Find this camp and go to the 'mote so I can rub-a-dub that Guinness!

{I got a trick! A treat!}.
{Ooooh, I got a winner! I think I got a winner!}.

Jay-Ski:.
{Let's go to the motel!} Girl, you know the time!
{I won't tell if you don't tell!} It's better than waitin' in that welfare.
Line!
{Let's go to the motel!} Girl, it ain't gon' hurt!
{I won't tell if you don't tell!} How you got that dual invert!
Yeah baby! Here we go, come on, come on, here we go, baby!
