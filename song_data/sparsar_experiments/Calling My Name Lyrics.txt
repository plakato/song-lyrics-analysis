Calling My Name Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

Hmm Ooh yeah.
I gotta slip away.
Cuz all these memories of you and me.
So crazy.
I gotta clear some space.
I'm tryin' figure out just how it got this way.
You dont' even know what I've been through.
You push me to the door.
And walk me through.
And now you want me back.
But I'm so through with you.

Release me from this love.

But its so wrapped up.
Stop call.
Stop callin.
Stop callin my name.
My name.
Stop callin me.
Stop callin my name.
Could you please stop callin me.
Please stop.
Please stop callin me.
Please stop.
Please stop callin my name.

I use to be afraid to live without you.
So I never once complained.

Until I found my strenght.
To finally get up on my feet and run away.
If you see me out with another guy.
Don't be suprised cuz you know why.

I-I was already done.
So don't keep tryin to pull me back.
I want you to.

Release me from this love.

But its so wrapped up.
Stop call.
Stop callin.
Stop callin my name.
My name.
Stop callin me.
Stop callin my name.
Could you please stop callin me.
Please stop.
Please stop callin me.
Please stop.
Would you please stop callin my name.

Stop call.
Stop callin.
Stop callin my name.
My name.
Stop callin me.
Stop callin my name.
Could you please stop callin me.
Please stop.
Please stop callin me.
Please stop.
Would you please stop callin my name.
