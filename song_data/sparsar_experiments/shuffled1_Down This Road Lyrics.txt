Down This Road Lyrics
by Bizarre.

Got a 30 pack of Bud in this Monte Carlo  .
The home of the purple gang and.
  .
When I gotta have it, blowing that kush  .
And reach under the rug and pull out a sack of bud  .
Fuck it, it's a bucket  .
Detroit, Michigan great place not to come  .
A bullet's in budget, I'll just go back to cookie cutting  .
Get 5 to 10 and Jackson Prison  .
Blue chevy's big body Regal's  .
And hit my buddy up for a nugget  .
She let her boyfriend see it and we never got it back  .
My boy said I'm tripping, but she looked at it its charm tho  .
crack addicts, lots of white boys, but ain't no B-Rabbit  .
20/20 vision make the wrong decision  .
Told her I'll give her the stick for a carton of marlboro's  .
Like creek water we harder than a drunk trying to dart throw  .
And I'm macking this slut who got an ass like a barn door  .
And we sitting in a fucking beanbag, on the front porch swinging lean back  .
Take a left motherfucker   .
You ain't ever been down this road before  .
Red Magnum, Helicopter doors. Big potholes will fuck up your 24's  .
Grandmama beat the switches where the air wind rolls  .
  .
Detroit, Michigan where people dont care no more  .
  .
What a mystic man I am with this art flow  .
Chrysler and Ford plant they ain't there no more  .
Gave my mama keys to a 1980 lac'  .
Abandoned homes, drug dealers,.
.
Buddy, it's all in the family, and I mean family by cousins  .
Sold a sack in the culdasack down that road  .
the home of Coleman Young  .
Car started out I need that push  .
You ain't ever seen a J running with no clothes  .
Mullets in the Starter Jacket your babies in the bed  .
Country motherfuckers yup. I got a carload  .
  .
Hammerton tuxedo, home of HKiller raised by lions, tigers, gorrilla's.
Catfish Billy, ain't it Bizarre tho?  .
75 north an hour from Toledo  .
Chevy's in the back barretta's click clack  .
  .
Big truck riding never clean that, buckshot signs you ain't ever seen that.
