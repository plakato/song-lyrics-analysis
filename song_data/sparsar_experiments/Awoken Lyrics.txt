Awoken Lyrics
by WoodenToaster.


What cause have I to feel glad 
I've built my life on judgment and causing pain, 
I, don't know those eyes, I see in the bloodstained, chrome, 
Now everything that I've had and everything I've known have been thrown away 
And with time. I'Ve come to find this. Isn'T my home 
 
I've stoked the fire seen more pain than you can know? 
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul 
Pushed. By desire to change the way my stream will flow, 
Now, I've awoken and I'm taking back control,
