Awoken Lyrics
by WoodenToaster.


What cause have I to feel glad?
I've built my life on judgment and causing pain.
I don't know those eyes I see in the bloodstained chrome.
Now everything that I've had and everything I've known have been thrown away.
And with time I've come to find this isn't my home.

I've stoked the fire, seen more pain than you can know.
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul.
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow.
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control.

WoodenToaster &amp; H8_Seed.
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams.
Please break my shackles,â€¨I want it to stop.

I man these wretched machines.
Day in, day out, the grinding wears on my brain.
Undermining my sanity, making me question my reality.
But life is not as it seems.
Should I take a chance of freedom and throw it all down the drain?
I've been imprisoned, please burn my transgressions away.

I'm sick of hurting, sick of thinking it's all I do.
I break those around me, those spared are very few.
But the bright sun is burning, and my sky shines ever blue.
Friendships surround me, I'm becoming a part of you.
