U Got The Power Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


If you've got the power I've got the feeling.
Big drums hearts worth stealing.
Silver and Gold Souls of the mountains.
Run aground in cities and towns when.
Life is heart that won't stop beating.
Boom boom gimme a reason.
We jump the fires for kicks and for feelings.
It's all we've got when...

All things are going against you.
We'll fight them out in the avenues.
All things are going against you.
Oo oo.....
When all things are coming to get you.
We'll fight them out in the avenues.
All things are coming to get you.
Oo oo.....

We come around to push push electric.
New kids already connected.
Into the light and out of the stillness.
In our times directions are endless.
Show me the signs and I'll show you kingdoms.
Boom boom gimme a reason.
We jump the fires for kicks and for feelings.
It's all we've got when...

When I see the light coming from your eyes.
I feel so paralyzed x4.
