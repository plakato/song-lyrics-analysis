Do The Funky Penguin Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Hey everybody, Mister Rufus is back.
I've another dance I know you're gonna like.
You can't do the penguin, unless you shuffle your feet.
When you do the funky penguin, I know it's all real.

Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.
Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.

Do in the United States.
Way over in England.
Want you to know what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about funky penguin.

Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.
Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.

Listen.
Shuffle to the left, shuffle to the right.
Get's so good to you, baby, you can do it all night.
Everybody doing it, it's all over town.
You can't mess around, got to get on down.

Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.
Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.

Come on join your feet, kick off your shoes.
Let it all hang out, ain't got nothing to lose.
Do it with your partner, do it by yourself.
You don't hurry up and get it, you're gonna get left.

Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.
Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.

Do the funky penguin.
Make it funky now.
Do the funky penguin.
Make it funky now.

Did you heard me?
Did you heard me?
Did you heard me?
Did you heard me?

Want to do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.
Do the funky penguin.
Do it right now.

Everybody doing it.
Everybody doing it.

Oh ho, do the funky penguin.
Oh ho, do the funky penguin.
Come on in.
