Do The Funky Penguin Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Hey everybody, Mister Rufus is back
I've another dance. I know you're gon na like
You can't do the penguin. Unless you shuffle your feet
When, you do the funky penguin. I know it's all real

Do the funky penguin
Do it right, now
Do, the funky penguin
Do it right now

Do in the United States
Way over in England
Want you to know what I'm talking about
I'm talking about funky penguin

Do, the funky penguin
Do it right, now
Do, the funky penguin
Do it right now

Listen
Shuffle to the Left shuffle to the right
Get's so good to you baby, you can do it all night
Everybody doing it. It'S all over town
You can't mess around got to get on down

Do the funky penguin
Do it right, now
Do, the funky penguin
Do it right now

Come on join your feet. Kick off your shoes
Let, it all! Hang out. Ain'T got nothing to lose
Do it with your partner. Do it by yourself
You, don't hurry up and get it you're gon na get left

Do the funky penguin
Do it right! Now
Do, the funky penguin
Do it right! Now

Do, the funky penguin
Make it funky! Now
Do the funky penguin
Make it funky now

Did, you heard me 
Did, you heard me 
Did, you heard me 
Did. You heard me 

Want to do the funky penguin
Do it right now
Do, the funky penguin
Do it right, now

Everybody, doing it

Oh ho. Do the funky penguin
Oh ho do the funky penguin
