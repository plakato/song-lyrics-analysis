I'm Still a Baller Lyrics
by Yungstar.


I'm still a baller, and it's plain to see.
I'm still a baller, watch out for that TYP.
I'm still a baller, leanin' that I-10 East.
I'm still a baller, rolling in the 600 SEC.

I'ma -- baller, I'ma twenty inch crawler.
Blades on my Impala, Don Paula on my rottweiller.
I-10 hauler, Twin Benz's is gonna follower.
Break these boys off I'ma twenty inch crawler.
Bust a left, a right, I'm outta sight I'm throwed.
I'm bouncin' off the road, Straight Profit sold'em.
I fitna' explode'em.
Tiny tune -- hop out my big body form.
Chain with the charm, can't forget Moet along.
I'm hopping out, I'm lookin good, diamonds against my wood.
Let it be understood, Southwest is my hood.
I'm pushing big body can't stop me.
For the millenium Straight Profit sells a million copies.
I'ma crawl slow puffin on the Optimo hit the sto'.
In a Y double O and my a.c. blowin' snow.
I'ma let me grass gleam, man I'm lookin clean.
Want remote control, big screens, and ice bezeltynes.

I'm still a baller, and it's plain to see.
I'm still a baller, watch out for that TYP.
I'm still a baller, leanin' that I-10 East.
I'm still a baller, rolling in the 600 SEC.

Slikk Breeze.
I'ma Lafayette hauler I been a shot caller.
My Georgia Perion, better known as the hogger.
These boys talking down on these streets of H-Town.
Blowing killer smoke by the pine.
Hit em up, spit em up.
I-10 connect.
Laf. Texas, Straight Profit, putting boys on they back.
How you feel about that.
You better grab for your gat.
When you walking through yo crib.
I'm beatin yo girl from the back.
So body rock, body rock, body rock to dis.
Haters standing in my way they got Laf. Tex pissed.
Wooday, chop chop keep my hand on my Glock.
Candy Red on my Benz time to put back the top.
I'ma crawl down slow puffing on the Optimo.
I'ma come down real on my tippy tippy toe.
Down the high way, the fly way.
I'ma come down cuz you know it's my way, my way.

I'm still a baller, and it's plain to see.
I'm still a baller, watch out for that TYP.
I'm still a baller, leanin' that I-10 East.
I'm still a baller, rolling in the 600 SEC.

I done got better, now let me move on.
Switched from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone.
Broke in two chrome, all the way to the millenium.
They used to count my spoke, now these hoes count my inches.
Had to get older -- my Bentley got colder.
I done got grown and got a chip on my shoulder.
Licks in Kuwait, got links in Pakistan.
Dre in Alabama, virtual reality Caravan.
Double doors and marble floors naked hoes around me.
Everytime I'm comin down, These niggas they wanna sign me.
Got the Lil' Will diamond grill we in the wind.
Blaze in the Ben and I can't forget the den.
The boo went down to Rueben's.
I'm watchin on a movie.
Drop da top its cotton and you know I'm in a jacuzzi.
Bourban and I'm swervin, man it's gettin hot.
My last name Lemmon.
Drive with my title off the lot, David Taylor.

I'm still a baller, and it's plain to see.
I'm still a baller, watch out for that TYP.
I'm still a baller, leanin' that I-10 East.
I'm still a baller, rolling in the 600 SEC.
