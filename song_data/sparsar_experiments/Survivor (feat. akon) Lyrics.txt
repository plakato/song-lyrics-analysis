by 40 Cal.


Didn'T tell ya im a ridah ridah 
Rollin, where the cash is .
 Lem me rap to ya, put the chrome in the ad-libs 
Survivor 
On parollin, the rap biz 
See they dont know. I turn happy homes into stash cribs 
See everywhere i go triple my work. 
Flip. Five nickels icicles sit on my shirt 
Shit. I be Sittin ya, turf and gettin rid of my work, 
I blast it ain't the past when they diggin up dirt. 
See. What? U know about plates with weight from straight cuba, 
I-95 blowin on state troopers, 
Takin, dice money. Just throwin tres dueces, im amazin 
Take ya soldiers and make juniors 
And spray, rugaz thatll, injure ya health im real 
Hit the bookie and give the benz to myself 
And my friends say: im in it for dealt well fuck, it 
Im a survivor who else cud. I depend on for help 
 
Chrorus Akon, 
No mattter, where i go or where i stay dont. Do it then im gon na? Do it my way, 
, I got ta get this cake and

Just ride wit me ride wit, ya, boy, 
And, roll wit, me roll wit, ya, boy 
Chea. Now? U rollin wit. 40 
U rollin wit, 40 
Ima ridah disrespect. The traffic light 
A survior known to hold the magnum tight 
Hyptnotize ya hoe knew i attract the dykes. 
And make her go both ways like hazard lights, 
I, keep it movin! Why? U think i rap this? Nice 
I got students always give em fast advice, 
How to bag slice grab the dice well come walk with me. Ill get ya, swagga

What! U know about Willie and he crashed the bike 
Same night at Willies and the jag in white 
Its, not rappin its braggin rights, 
While, im laughin 
You in ya, uncle benz, like bags of rice, yikes,
