Survivor (feat. akon) Lyrics
by 40 Cal.


Didn't tell ya im a ridah, ridah.
Rollin where the cash is.
Lemme rap to ya, put the chrome in the ad-libs.
Survivor.
On parollin the rap biz.
See they dont know i turn happy homes into stash cribs.
See everywhere i go, triple my work.
Flip five nickels, icicles, sit on my shirt.
Shit i be, Sittin ya turf, and gettin rid of my work.
I blast, it ain't the past when they diggin up dirt.
See what u know about plates with weight from straight cuba.
I-95 blowin on state troopers.
Takin dice money, just throwin tres dueces, im amazin.
Take ya soldiers and make juniors.
And spray rugaz thatll injure ya health, im real.
Hit the bookie and give the benz to myself.
And my friends say im in it for dealt, well fuck it.
Im a survivor, who else cud i depend on for help?

Chrorus: Akon.
No mattter where i go, or where i stay, dont do it then im gonna do it my way,.
I gotta get this cake and.
get it today, and im gonna keep comin if ya stand in my way.
Just ride wit me, ride wit ya boy.
And roll wit me, roll wit ya boy.
Chea, now u rollin wit 40.
U rollin wit 40.
Ima ridah, disrespect the traffic light.
A survior, known to hold the magnum tight.
Hyptnotize ya, hoe knew i attract the dykes.
And make her go both ways like hazard lights.
I keep it movin, why u think i rap this nice?
I got students, always give em fast advice.
How to: bag, slice, grab the dice, well come walk with me, ill get ya swagga.
right.
What u know about Willie and he crashed the bike.
Same night at Willies and the jag in white.
Its not rappin, its braggin rights.
While im laughin.
You in ya uncle benz like bags of rice, yikes.
