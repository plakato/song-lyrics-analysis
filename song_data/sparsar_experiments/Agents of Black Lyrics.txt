Agents of Black Lyrics
by Running Wild.


The gates of hell are opened wide.
The evil reigns with eternal night.
The end of time is breaking lose.
Light or dark, you're up to choose.

The fallen gods, infinite pride.
They serve the dark, they fear the light.
They caress the lie, they kiss the hate.
They guard the flies, the rule the shade.

Black, souls insane, invade the world's with a feast of war and pain.
The final fight will be done when they are dead and gone.
Agents of black.

They're sending out their raging beasts.
To invade the world from west to east.
Infected wings to spread their seed.
They hunt men down their beasts to feed.

Black, souls insane, invade the world's with a feast of war and pain.
The final fight will be done when they are dead and gone.

Authorities an evils force.
They saved their pact with lies and wars.
Blackened men, their souls are banned.
The final fight, all evils end.

Black, souls insane, invade the world's with a feast of war and pain.
The final fight will be done when they are dead and gone.
