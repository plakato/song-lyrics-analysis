ForeplayLong Time Lyrics

It's been such a long time.
I think I should be goin', yeah.
And time doesn't wait for me, it keeps on rollin'.
Sail on, on a distant highway.
I've got to keep on chasin' a dream.
I've gotta be on my way.
Wish there was something I could say.

Well I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along.
You'll forget about me after I've been gone.
And I take what I find, I don't want no more.
It's just outside of your front door.

It's been such a long time. It's been such a long time.

Well I get so lonely when I am without you.
But in my mind, deep in my mind.
I can't forget about you.
Good times, and faces that remind me.
I'm tryin' to forget your name and leave it all behind me.
You're comin' back to find me.

It's been such a long time. It's been such a long time.

Yeah. It's been such a long time, I think I should be goin', yeah.
And time dosnt wait for me, it keeps on rollin'.
There's a long road, I've gotta stay in time with.
I've got to keep on chasin' that dream, though I may never find it.
I'm always just behind it.

Well I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along.
Takin' my time, just movin' along.
Takin' my time, yeah I'm takin' my time....
