DestructionDrawn Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Excuse my face it's out of place to your kind.
Can't expect to change your mind.
Waste your time and loved you to distraction.
You've done too much to criticize.
Take your aim and place the blame.
It's your turn it's not enough to say goodbye.
The same old lies again to play the part so well.
The storyline you sell.
It's all complete you roll your eyes and walk away.
Waste my time and loved you to distraction.
You're the one i left behind.

She was free.
A map was drawn.
To children from long ago.
Left by twenty-nine.
Through years she couldn't find.
And they cried / they saw her go.
Not from her own strength.
They feared that they were gone.
She dreamt that they were near.
All i knew seemed to end.
Seeing her once again.
Water coming up.
Throwing them down / sinking now.
And he said i couldn't forget.
As jenny stepped across.
Sweet things come in time.
I guess i'll wait for mine.
