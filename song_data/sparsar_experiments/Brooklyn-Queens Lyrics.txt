Brooklyn-Queens Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

* Daddy Rich scratches Brooklyn! *.
* 3 bars of drum beats *.
* Daddy Rich scratches Brooklyn! *.

Real cool.. cause Brooklyn's cool!
Friday doin the last day of school.
Girls steppin to the mall to swing.
Settin up dollars for their summer fling.
Cars on the avenue create gridlock.
And there's girls like MAD at the bus stop.
Not waitin on the bus, but waitin on the cash flow.
Fellas are laughin, gassin the past ho.
Girl steps to me and pushes issue.
That knot you got, is that money or tissue?
Feelin on the bulge, thinkin it's her own.
I tell her that it's money and she should move on.
She says she's pure from legs to her thighs.
And we should talk over some chinese and fries.
I tell her to step, but hey that's the scene.
Cause she ain't nothin.. but a Brooklyn Queen.

We are looking for 'Brooklyn'...
We are looking for the.. Brooklyn-Queens!

State the rhyme, borough of Brooklyn.
Otherwise known as Crooklyn.
Freaks fortify flesh with gold.
Ears hang trunk, in a slave.
hold.
Walk past, don't get the time of day.
Played like suede, on a summer sway.
Conversated, till I made her laugh.
Said, I'm Pete Nice.. you want my autograph?
Oval Office closed as she heard this.
She said, From 3rd Bass? I could do this.
Listen closely, slowly took a swig of intoxicants.
Cause the Brooklyn Queen's a gold digger.

Squared away.. with my digits and tonight's plans.
When I feel a crab grab my right hand.
Slapped her on the back, tried to calm her.
Asking her, Now what's the reason for the drama?
Her next move was straight out of textbook.
Haven't we met before? Giving me a sex look.
Yo Wisdom, your lyrics are in bad taste.
So I'm forced to give you nothing but the Gas Face.
You better go, for hoppin on the cab or bus.
Cause you're downtown and you're simply too fabulous.
But get this, ain't this a humdinger?
She stepped to a retard sportin' a four-finger ring.
Somewhere in the skin tight jeans.
I'm gonna scoop the best of the Brooklyn-Queens.

Last exit to Brooklyn I enter.
Carefully the Queen holds my scepter.
Gettin' numb like a Derelict on scotch.
I'm Dick Lewis, cause baby I'm watchin' you.
Scheme on a brother for a knot.
To choose between the have and the have-not.
Do you doubt the shade of vanilla?
I'll play Elvis and you play Priscilla.
Oh he's no hero, better yet Billy Dee.
Advertise cheap liquor for a fee.
A Brooklyn Queen, rushes Russell Simmons.
That's like Tyson rushin' Givens.

* 3rd Bass says 'Brooklyn-Queens'  *.

MC Serch Who's on Prince Paul's cactus?
'Brooklyn-Queens'.
MC Serch Hahaha, yeah check it out.
'Brooklyn-Queens'.
Yo, 'Brooklyn-Queens'.
* Daddy Rich keeps scratching *.
