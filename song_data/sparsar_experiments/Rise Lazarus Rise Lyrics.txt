Rise Lazarus Rise Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

There'S a carrion curse forever haunting our souls
Until the very day we're lowered in a hole
At stygian shores. We are doomed to run aground
Waiting in fear, as the divine spark is snuffed out

No longer. Will you wander aimless through the afterlife
With, the caress of the casket holding you tight
Were destined for worms when our lives, conclude
Last rites, be damned death's the beginning, renewed

Rise Lazarus rise
Rise from the grave
Dispel, the sleep
Inside, your veins

Rise Lazarus rise
Rise from the tomb
Regain, your breath
Forever exhumed

Death is just the Beginning
Defy fate, reanimate
Death is just the beginning
Defy fate. Reanimate
The epitaph wiped clean
The tombstone ground up
Death is just the beginning
Defy fate. Re-Animate
No need for eulogies
Hymns. Never sung

Mortuary science will be forever be eclipsed
Funeral directors, deprived of their scripts
Denounce. The arcane implements of the past
Now that lifeless actors are no longer cast

The. Final curtain call fills our body with dread
It's a shame to expire when we meet our end
Cease, your offerings for the unfortunate dead
Silence, your prayers I'll, give them new life, instead

Rise Lazarus rise
Rise from the grave
Dispel. The sleep
Inside, your veins

Rise Lazarus rise
Rise from the tomb
Regain, your breath
Forever exhumed

Death, is just the beginning
Defy fate. Reanimate
Death is just the beginning
Defy fate. Reanimate
The epitaph wiped clean
The tombstone ground up
Death is just the beginning
Defy fate. Re-Animate
No need for eulogies
Hymns. Never sung

Death is just the beginning
Defy fate. Reanimate
Death is just the beginning
Defy fate: reanimate
The epitaph wiped clean
The tombstone ground up
Death is just the beginning
Defy fate. Re-Animate

Mortuary science will be forever be eclipsed
Funeral directors, deprived of their scripts
Denounce. The arcane implements of the past
Now that lifeless actors are no longer cast.
