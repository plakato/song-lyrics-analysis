Rise Lazarus Rise Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

There's a carrion curse forever haunting our souls.
Until the very day we're lowered in a hole.
At stygian shores we are doomed to run aground.
Waiting in fear as the divine spark is snuffed out.

No longer will you wander aimless through the afterlife.
With the caress of the casket holding you tight.
Were destined for worms when our lives conclude.
Last rites be damned, death's the beginning renewed.

Rise Lazarus rise.
Rise from the grave.
Dispel the sleep.
Inside your veins.

Rise Lazarus rise.
Rise from the tomb.
Regain your breath.
Forever exhumed.

Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, reanimate.
Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, reanimate.
The epitaph wiped clean.
The tombstone ground up.
Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, re-animate.
No need for eulogies.
Hymns never sung.

Mortuary science will be forever be eclipsed.
Funeral directors deprived of their scripts.
Denounce the arcane implements of the past.
Now that lifeless actors are no longer cast.

The final curtain call fills our body with dread.
It's a shame to expire when we meet our end.
Cease your offerings for the unfortunate dead.
Silence your prayers I'll give them new life instead.

Rise Lazarus rise.
Rise from the grave.
Dispel the sleep.
Inside your veins.

Rise Lazarus rise.
Rise from the tomb.
Regain your breath.
Forever exhumed.

Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, reanimate.
Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, reanimate.
The epitaph wiped clean.
The tombstone ground up.
Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, re-animate.
No need for eulogies.
Hymns never sung.

Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, reanimate.
Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, reanimate.
The epitaph wiped clean.
The tombstone ground up.
Death is just the beginning.
Defy fate, re-animate.

Mortuary science will be forever be eclipsed.
Funeral directors deprived of their scripts.
Denounce the arcane implements of the past.
Now that lifeless actors are no longer cast.
