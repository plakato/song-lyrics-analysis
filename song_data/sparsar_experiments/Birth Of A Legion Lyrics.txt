Birth Of A Legion Lyrics
by Unearth.

We stand in flames to defend this home.
Not one.
None can defeat us.
To pave the way for the new - The birth of a legion.
So natural.
The order falls.
So natural.
The end archaic.
Dissension breeds within their hearts.
The haunting calls of devastation.
To stand this ground - stand our ground.
A steadfast gathering.
Blunt force to erase all that we've known.
To witness this distance between us.
Change of Flame.
The Birth of a Legion.
You threw it all away.
