Giant's Song Lyrics
by Rune.

A desert surrounds me, an endless ochre sublime.
Sun is beating, cracking the earth beneath me.
I can only move on.
Insignificant in my incompetent wandering.

On the horizon I see long shadows cast by the sun.
An arrowhead of figures, marching obstinate.
Toward the orb itself, life giving magic one.
I can feel the power in their steps.

So I run to catch these giants.
I scream, weakness tries to get the best of me.

I see footprints now in front of me.
There have been others here before like me.
Struggling for a glimpse of this holy walk.

The creatures walk around me and I see.
Mottling their naked flesh are bodies.
Of those who have come here before me.
They embrace each other with an under worldly grace.
A sensuous binding made of struggle and release.

They beckon me, a pair of striking eyes I've seen before.
Green pupils shrouded in shepherd boy hair.
Perceptive and sagacious with an uncompromising stare.
I see the path through limbs and throats, determined and aware.

I climb, supple flesh beneath my feet and hands, urging me on.
This path, winding to the sun.
Every piece of magic that convulses out of us, pulling us up.

The creature trudges on, an army of them, of us.
Across this vast plain something beckons us.
I see others joining on, jumping on the feet and.
Some finally are done.
Finding their place among the others.

I pull myself once more up.
Then stand atop the shoulders of this giant.
Face into the sun.
Big enough the sky has become a sea of crimson flame.
A tongue comes out to kiss us all.
The giant reaches up with me, together.
We touch the sun.
