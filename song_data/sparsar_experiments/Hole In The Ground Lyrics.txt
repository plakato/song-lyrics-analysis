Hole In The Ground Lyrics
by Tyler Joseph.

You once were oh-so-close.
But I don't remember.
Where you are and who you know.
But come this September.
You will fly on your own.
Cause you got a letter.
You must find, find your home.
And it won't get much better.

I try so hard.
To fly but my heart.
Won't go very far.
No, no.
And my own two hands.
Will start bleeding again.
And floor will turn to.
To a hole in the ground.

The plans that I make.
Roads that I take.
break.
To holes that will go.
Where I don't know.
They are solid grounds illusions.
That write themselves off.
As perfectly normal solutions.

Pollutions in my eyes.
My disguise will take me.
Break me.
Won't save me this time.
There's a vision.
But you won't save me this time.
My decision for living.
Isn't mine to decide and.

You just seem oh-so-far.
Past the stars and past my heart.
I can almost feel you and I start.
To close my eyes and sing a song.
I will keep singing cause Im wrong.
But you were singing with me all along.

I try so hard.
To fly.
But my heart.
Won't go very far.
No, no.
And my own two hands.
Will start bleeding again.
And floor will turn to.
To a hole in the ground.

Do not be alarmed.
If I fall into the sun.
If I fall.
And my own two hands will start bleeding.
And then they will lower me.
In to, to a hole in the ground.
