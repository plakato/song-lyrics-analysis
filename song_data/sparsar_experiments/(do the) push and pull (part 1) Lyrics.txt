(do the) push and pull (part 1) Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Hey everybody, Mister Rufus in town
Came, here to take care of business
Ain't gon na mess. Around
I got a brand new dance that ain't no bull
Everybody's doing it. Talking'Bout, push and pull

I said push pull push pull
Get on up, get on down
Get on up
Take, it round and round

I said push pull push pull
Little bit. More
Push it pull it
Push it pull it

Lookie here
Push it pull it
Push it pull it
Push it pull it
Push it pull it

Push, it pull it
Push. It pull it
Push, it pull it
Push it pull it

Get out on the floor. You'Re gon na get left
Get on your own. Pretty baby now go for yourself
It's, easier, taking candy from a baby, don't hand me no bull
Now, you got it baby. You got that push and pull

I said push pull
Push pull
Listen get on up, get on down
Get on up
Take it round and round

I said push pull push pull
Listen
Push it pull it
Push it pull it

Double upon
Push it pull it
Push it pull it
Push it pull it

Push it pull it
Push, it pull it
Push. It pull it
Ah

Oh Mister, Clean and James Brown
Everybody been messing around
I'm doing a hundred and laying on full
I got this thing. Talking'Bout push and pull

I said push pull
Push, pull oh ho

Push and pull oh ho.
