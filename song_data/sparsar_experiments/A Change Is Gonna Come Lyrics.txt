A Change Is Gonna Come Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.


I was born by the river in a little tent.
And just like the river, I've been running ever since.
It's been a long time coming.
But I know a change is gonna come.

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die.
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky.
It's been a long time coming.
But I know a change is gonna come.

I go to the movie, and I go downtown.
Somebody keep telling me Don't hang around.
It's been a long time coming.
But I know a change is gonna come.

Then I go to my brother and I say, Brother, help me please.
But he winds up knocking me back down on my knees.

There've been times that I've thought I couldn't last for long.
But now I think I'm able to carry on.
It's been a long time coming.
But I know a change is gonna come.
