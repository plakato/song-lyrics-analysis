Do Ya Lyrics
by SWV.

I'm, I'm too sexy, check my worth.
Boy, don't get your feelings hurt.

Tryna get this dairy queens to desert.
Got that yummy, blaze it, blaze it.
You heard mine's just more expensive.
Get a ninja in my benzer.
I see you and and all your friends'.

And I see it in your eyes that you miss us.
Pockin' SWV, now you and me.
Or drive past when I say I missed us.
Guess keep or can escaped us.
I'm so low, gettin' flicked up.
I'm singin' do you, do you, do ya?
Sing or do me, now what you boo ya.

I'm feelin' myself, I know I'm fly.
I'm done with the pain, doin' better things.
I'm movin' on, I'm goin' out.
I got plans, I got places to be.

Am I the best thing ever happened to you?
I'm the best thing ever happened.
My love was took for granted, now you see.
I'm the best thing ever happened.

I know what's your brand of girlfriend.
Really, do you think she's better?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

Do you miss my kisses on your lips.
As you did with your new girl?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

I'm good right now.
I wish I did, would right now.
Boy, I ain't got no time, I'm a do me.
I'm a dance with him.
You had your chance, you slipped.
I'm a 10 so go run to your 3.

Am I the best thing ever happened to you?
I'm the best thing ever happened.
My love was took for granted, now you see.
I'm the best thing ever happened.

I know what's your brand of girlfriend.
Really, do you think she's better?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

Do you miss my kisses on your lips.
As you did with your new girl?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

All my ladies in the front.
All my ladies in the front.
All my ladies in the back.
All my ladies in the back.
Got your hair, girl?
You got your nails, girl?
Want you clappin' like this.
Break it down like this.
This this this.

Boys, you feel alone.
When you do her wrong.
What you need, you can't find in another girl.
Karma is a mother.
And you find a lover.
Oh, go to hell.

I know what's your brand of girlfriend.
Really, do you think she's better?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

Do you miss my kisses on your lips.
As you did with your new girl?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

I know what's your brand of girlfriend.
Really, do you think she's better?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

Do you miss my kisses on your lips.
As you did with your new girl?
Baby, do you, do you, do ya?
Do you, do you, do ya?

All my ladies in the front.
All my ladies in the front.
All my ladies in the back.
All my ladies in the back.
Got your hair, girl?
You got your nails, girl?
Want you clappin' like this.
Break it down like this.
This this this.
