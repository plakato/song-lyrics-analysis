7-1-3 Lyrics
by Yung Redd.


Yeah 7-1-3 new South, Sucka Free.
In the trunk, we on your heels mayn.
Holla back, come on come on.

Yung Redd.
Only if you knew, I'm playing by my own rules.
Keep a new pair of 22's, for the old school.
Neck full of rose gold, hoes spreading the news.
Even them days I was broke, I was paying dues.
A hundred miles and running, you couldn't fill my shoes.
I break bread with my niggas, yeah that's what niggas do.
These clowns plotting on me, got me looking in my rear.
Nothing but blood and shedding tears, through most of my years.
But anyway I showed and proved, to most of my peers.
Sooner or later, recognized me as a pioneer.
Who would of thought, that I'd be playing the right cards.
And more grain than a lawn, in your front yard.

Now you can tell, we all about them dollar bills y'all.
Plus I got 24 inches, on my wheels y'all.
Them niggas playing mayn, I gotta keep it real y'all.
I'm on the grind, so I get it how I live y'all - 2x.

Lil' Ron.
I'm money getting, while niggas slipping they really tripping.
I'm on a mission, peep how I'm living them chicks is flipping.
Now pay attention and listen, the game ain't switching.
Did I mention if it's tension, then your lil' ass missing.
Stop depending on niggas, and get your own cash.
I love spending that money quick, so I make it fast.
And it seems, some of these rap niggas flow is trash.
But me, I'm leaving the bank with big money bags.
Don't try to snatch my shit, nigga I will blast.
Them hollow tips, got your ass stuck to the grass.
The spinners on the drop, look like they doing cart-wheels.
My money long, like I discovered the arch build.

I represent, that 7-1-3 nigga.

Scooby.
It's them hustler stacking, ghetto reality live from the H.
And the truth is, we got it on fire in the H.
So no problem, we don't mind taking your place.
We ain't come for the chump change, we came for the safe.
And hey, thrown in the field.
If you ain't never been in the real car, that wasn't going very far.
Or you just a stupid nigga, let them other dummies move with ya.
Cause y'all, ain't taking down Scoob' nigga.

Unique.
I'm Grit-tastic, these hoes adore this.
I'm on point with my bucks, like TJ Ford g'eah.
You niggas is worthless, got no purpose.
Might as well be a sideshow, and work for a circus ay.
I'm bout my fast money, ask around.
And if you ask bout my money, hit your ass with pounds clowns.
7-1-3, you ain't noticed.
Unique that bastard boy, I'm so focused.

Poppy.
Guess who's back in the mix, from the land where they package and ship.
Crack on the strips, we added to get the cabbage and split.
And for the cabbage, automatics'll rip.
Baggies to bits, by any means when we after the chips.
Fuck being average ships, you need power to play.
Whether you work a nine to five, or turn powder to yay.
Get out the way, that's how he put it down in the H.
We ride chrome, a inch for every hour of the day ay.

Yeah-yeah, holla at me.
