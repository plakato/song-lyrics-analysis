And I know you gonna be my soul.
And I don't wanna go and take you on with me!
And I feel the way you look at me.
And I know you own it all to me.
And days grow older, days grow older....
I can be the only...
And I know you gonna be my every... Oh, yeah.
My oh, oh, yeah.
When you rise from the ashes of the world.
I know, I know that they will run me.
And you go....
And I won't be one of those.
No, I won't be one of those.
I just gotta continue on my day.
I gotta be ....
And I don't wanna be a kind of ....
I stood ..be on my side!
I stood ..it's gonna be on my side.
And you lift me up and you bring me down ....
And i'll be the one to take you on her side.
And I know you wanna.. And i'mma waste your time.
