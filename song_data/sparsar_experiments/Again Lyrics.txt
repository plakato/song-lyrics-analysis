Again Lyrics
by Vivid.

What has happened today.
Still nothing for you.
Still waiting for the day.
We won't walk to the edge.

A little further.
So join us on the way.

Again - yes, we'll do it once again.
Again - that thing that no one understands.
Again - we'll do it til the very end.

Cause it feels so good to be forever wrong.
Are we ready to sin.
Provoke and crush them.
A subatomic blast.

We're the small city pimp.
We'll kick you're ass in.
Your ignorance won't last.

Again - yes, we'll do it once again.
Again - that thing that no one understands.
Again - we'll do it til the very end.

Cause it feels so good to be forever wrong.

Again - we will do it once again.
Again - that thing that no one understands.
Again - we'll do it til the very end.

Cause it feels so good to be forever wrong.
Feels so good to be forever wrong.
Let them go, she said.
Cause they can't see themselves as.

Being the ones who depend.
Bring me home, I said.
Cause I will do it all again.

Again - yes, we'll do it once again.
Again - that thing that no one understands.
Again - we'll do it til the very end.
Cause it feels so good inside.
