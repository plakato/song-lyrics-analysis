About Your Love Lyrics
by Twisted Minds.


Share with me your passion.
Show me your aura.
And play me your music.
Open up your heart.

Get ready to let it go.
Cause with me you'll never know.
And so do you have the time.
The patience the right mind.
To see what you'll find?

Cause I'm like....

I'm like....

I'm like....

I'm like....

Then I'm like....

Roofie x5.
Your girl go low like a nigga 2 feet.

Dreams of infinity.
Tangled in reality.
Love drop rather casually.
Heart's broken on the balcony.
On my knee where I stay.
Married to the things that she's taken away.

Way overboard.
What, she can't do this anymore?

Part 2, three or four.
Amount of minutes she took to walk out the door.
What was that for?
Tired of it all.
I might as well leave.
The last thing she said.
Breath.

Yea, it's awful.
But I be acting like it all good.
I'm drowning in water that's only one foot.
And these tears and years gave me this outlook.
And every time you cry.
You best believe every time I died.
Listen to my words every time I rhyme.
It cuts deep because you it's pain you'll find.
I promised to be perfectly honest.
But that's not being honest to be perfectly honest.
I spit Feelings when I'm on this mic.
And your girl playing Geppetto in my Board Game Life.
You're acting like....
You know, actually you should stop asking me.
If I'm still in love with this girl named....
And you confer with it.
I'm sorry for being so nerdy, not being there early and speaking so dirty.
Yea, my mouth in need of a clergy and.
This feeling is feeling unearthly.
This heartbroken speech is the truth.
But there's a new love, Golden Era.
