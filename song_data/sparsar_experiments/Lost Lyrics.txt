Lost Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.

I lost the best girl. I could ever find 
So if you think I'm interested in you never mind. 
She gave her all to me, but I kept to myself. 
Which was cause I'd been cheated on by someone else. 
I had spent too many years being gullible 
Until life hit me with that. Welcome To the Jungle flow 
So yeah, I think you're wonderful, ... 
F*ck. It though 
 
I lost the best woman. I could ever find 

I loved the fact that we were both Gemini 
I hate. The fact that I swore to God I would never lie 
I swore to God I'd forever. Try 
Forever would try to be that better guy 
But. Now things aren't going too well 
And. The only I could swear to God about is that I'm going to Hell, 
 
I lost the best partner. I could ever find. 
This type of sh*t happens to me every time. 
From puppy love Michelle G 
To, the queen of my heart, L-D 
To, the rebound that lasted for five days, 
To the rebound that lasted for five years, 
To the many many one-night-stands that led up ... 
To, my dear 
 
I, lost the best girl. I could ever find 
I lost the best girl. I could ever find
