Lost Lyrics
by Rustie.


You are my diamond in the rough.
When the goin' gets tough, you're there.
I'm never home, I'm always broke.
But you make a place that I call home.
And I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
You are my diamond in the rough.
When the goin' gets tough, you're there.
I'm never home, I'm always broke.
But you make a place that I call home.
And I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.

So many ladies, they're lookin' lovely.
But inside they're so ugly.
And I admit I've made mistakes.
I got caught up and I fucked with snakes.
But I keep running back to you.
Is this something that I have to do?
Well you know I ain't mad at you.
That's what you said.

I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.

You are my diamond in the rough.
When the goin' gets tough, you're there.
I'm never home, I'm always broke.
But you make a place that I call home.
And I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.

I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
I'd be lost without you in my.
