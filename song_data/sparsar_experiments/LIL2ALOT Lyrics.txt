Aye, ge- get that out the trunk....
It's in the front not the back....
Nah...
Yeah, that's them right there....
Iight...
Iight close it back....
Let's go!
Come on!

Little to a lot.
Countin figures in the backseat.
Foreign women next to me tryna match 3.

My niggas get the guap.
Gotta question u can ask me.
Pullin out the lot finna cruise down ashby.

Little to a lot.
Road running like a track meet.
Run the streets but I never been a athlete.
Ima drop my top speed racing down the back street.
Wit two freaks they just tryna climb the cash tree.

Little to a lot.
In the parkin lot Doin donuts.
Asiago box.
I can't Drop the top.
This a loaner.
Audemar piguet wit the icy rocks.
That's corona.
Misguided niggas askin me to filament.
Ain't say fill em in know my scholars Feelin this.
Bumpin ye lookin like a brick of yay.
Smellin like a brick of.
It's my time it's tickin.
Speakin up so listen.
Needa slip permission.
For these lessons im givin.
Rookie of the year next year.
But.
This gear.
Will excuse for the wait.
Just make sure u know the code when you pullin in my gate.
Nigga got his own estate.
My initials in my plate.
Pappadeaux I order steak.
Feet up chillin by the lake.
Spike lee modern day.
For the love of the game.
Swear a nigga goes off.
Tryna get my shows off.
Jeep 4 door wit the doors off.
She inside wit her clothes off.

Little to a lot.
Money talk.
That's my favorite topic.
I don't know the cost.
If I see it then I'm coppin.
Burberry to my boxers.
And she love plaid.
She call me daddy don't know her dad.
Treat YA favorite rapper like a mattress pad.
Treat ya girlfriend like a trampoline.
Don't know her name but she know the team.
Lil nigga got big dreams.
Grande.
Main girl beyonce.
Swear my flow beyond say.
So it's destiny child.
These niggas is showin respect to me now.
And I ain't made it it's crazy.
Women askin for what's left of me now.
Why they gotta be so shady.
They gone love me for my ambition.
Drive retarted stupid man and I ain't talkin transmission.

Now I see a lil clearer.
I only see my competition when I'm lookin in the mirror.
Moncler look vanilla.
Throw it up to the ceiling.
Willie beamen.
Diamonds gleamin.
Models dancing.
I'm preheating.
Triple double that's preseason.
Numbers on the board.
Colder than before.
Look at my decor.
I deserve awards.

Little to a lot.
Climbin charts.
Swear I'm biggie baby.
Ima call up droc.
We gone shop.
I swear I'm living crazy.
Stuck inside my dorm.
Makin music gotta nigga torn.
Made a couple hits burned a disc.
Tell me who to warn.
Thousand dollar fit yea.
Break my wrist yea.
Said ya Rollie was legit yea heard a tick yea.
Fge the clique yea.
From the 6 yea.
Make clothes n he spit yea he so lit yea.
No limit records.
Jesus piece on my necklace.
Eat beats just for breakfast.
Jerome bettis after lettuce I could never fumble.
Look into a dreamer eyes and tell me I ain't humble.
Changin, rearranging rap.
40 oz that's my thinkin cap.
I think that the rap savior's back.
In n out peekaboo.
Parlaying wit a freak or two.
Designer shoes I keep a few.
Black n white give em beetle juice.
Black n white mikes give em beetle juice.
Black n white mikes give em beetle *whoooo*.
