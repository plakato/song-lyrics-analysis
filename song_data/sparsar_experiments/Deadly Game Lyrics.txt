Deadly Game Lyrics
by X-Raided.


X-Raided locc never was a choir boy. 
Ya folks got a gang of priors 
Maybe. That'S why one-time's be triflin 
Tryin to give a young nigga thirty-five to life 
When. I ain't even done nothin wrong. Offica 
I have no in-fo to offer-ya. 
He asked my name. So i came off the brain 
Told him, I'm John Doe - and this is my hoe. Jane 
He said smart mouth nigga don't make me. Do ya 
Put my thumbprint in his high-tech computer, 
My name came back with a warrant felonies 
Now. They got me down. Town spreadin my anus 
Buttocks, I'm like what the fuck is it now 
They say I robbed a liquor store.
