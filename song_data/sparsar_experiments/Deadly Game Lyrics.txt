Deadly Game Lyrics
by X-Raided.


X-Raided locc never was a choir boy.
Ya folks got a gang of priors.
Maybe that's why one-time's be triflin.
Tryin to give a young nigga thirty-five to life.
When i ain't even done nothin wrong offica.
I have no in-fo to offer-ya.
He asked my name so i came off the brain.
Told him, I'm John Doe and this is my hoe Jane.
He said, smart mouth nigga, don't make me do ya.
Put my thumbprint in his high-tech computer.
My name came back with a warrant, felonies.
Now they got me down town, spreadin my anus.
Buttocks, I'm like, what the fuck is it now ?
They say I robbed a liquor store; they know when, where, and how.
And it's foul, got your boy to' up from the flo' up.
Moms in the courtroom lookin like she bout to throw up.
It's a strong armed robbery, strapped in the commosion.
Pre-trial conference, D.A. got a proposition.
He said your losing trial, you'll get 38 with L on top.
Take the deal he'd give me five with havin most of the charges dropped.
Hopped on the deal quicker than flash.
It's sad I admit that, but two and a half ain't bad I got getback.
Sentence me to five, two I gotta bring.
Only strike one, swing batta batta swing.

One-eight-seven on the D.A.
He ain't tryin to give a young black nigga no leeway.
Yes yes... y'all.
One-eight seven on the whole courtroom, motherfuck em' all.
You better swing batta batta swing.
Cause when you get your third felony, thats fifty years you gotta bring.
It's a deadly game of baseball.
So when they try to pull you over.
Shoot em' in the face y'all.

Now i'm fresh out, unrehabilitated.
Raided doin hella good, and my P.O. hates it.
Hates dick, she's a dyke lesbian bitch.
Can't wait to violate me for some petty ass shit.
I gotta get a job so I'm fillin applications.
Fightin the temptation, of slang-nation.
Minimum wage don't get it, five bucks an hour don't cut it.
Raided ain't widdit.
Fuck it, went and struck it rich on the dope sack.
The homie gave me two, and told me to bring him fo' back.
Now it's time for me to start havin thangs.
Got me a coupe and painted it candy apple green.
It gleams, clear coat sprayed on thickly.
Fools out to get me cause my shit is lookin sticky.
I'm at the club and I can feel them sucka's scopin.
I'm knowin they plottin on me, but I'm still hopin.
They won't try my unless they want to die.
They will be drippin more blood than Mrs. Simpson was.
Sho' nuff, ain't a bluff, here them sucka's come.
Got me reachin under the panel to handle the forty-four caliber gun, uhh.
Spun him around with a fat magnum round.
Got him on the ground makin funny sounds, uhh.
I got a problem, witnesses.
Ten pos-itive identi-fa-cations.

One-eight-seven on the D.A.
He ain't tryin to give a young motherfucka no leeway.
Yes yes... y'all.
One-eight seven on the whole courtroom, motherfuck em' all.
You better swing batta batta swing.
Cause when you get your third felony, thats fifty years you gotta bring.
It's a deadly game of baseball.
So when they try to pull you over.
Take em' on a chase y'all.

I'm on swoll, five years later.
Fresh out the pin, locc'ed up I'm X-Raided.
X-Raided locc ready to have me a ball.
Fuck my P.O. I'm goin AWOL.
They all can suck my dick.
I'm sick and tired of goin through all this bitch-made shit.
I got two strikes right now as we speak, and peep.
I'm not gonna let you motherfuckas do me.
A petty with a prior will buy your fate.
With wilson in office you gets no date.
So I'm putting my belongings on grayhound bus number twenty-two.
Headed to another state, me and my crew.
Unpack my shit, stack my grip.
California and Pete Wilson can suck this dick.
If you already didn't know, you couldn't trust his bitch ass.
Look how he did Polly Klass.
Used her death, and the family's name.
To gain more votes, and political fame.
And it's a shame, I'm the one they sayin is a monster.
Juvenile delinquent, steppin out of sequence.
Fuck that, I ain't goin out like a punk.
That ain't my style, rip him from his asscrack to his nuttsack now.
They wanna kill a nigga like me.
I blast one, blast two, strike three yellin....

One-eight-seven on the D.A.
He ain't tryin to give a young motherfucka no leeway.
Yes yes... y'all.
One-eight-seven on the whole courtroom, motherfuck em' all.
