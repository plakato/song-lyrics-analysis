Crow Jane Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Well now, Crow Jane don't make no sense to me.
She left me hanging from the poplar tree.
No I never ever felt so free.
Look at, mama, what you're doin' to me.

Cause it ain't no difference which way I smile.
I ain't good lookin' from a quarter mile.
Once had a women called me angel child.
My reputation keeps me on trial.

But who's gonna save me from myself?
Gotta lay the blame on someone else.

Somehow I ain't got no hope.
Cause I'm still runnin' from the sheriff's rope.
My shoes don't fit me cause they filled with dope.
Crow Jane quit me and I just can't cope.

But all I know is that I'll still run.
And pledge allegiance to the settin' sun.
I must've lost cause Crow Jane won.
I'll never learn from anything I've done.

Crow Jane's the strangest thing that ever talked.
Lips of honey but of tongues of chalk.
Feet may be crooked but sure can walk.
Took my money left me in shock.

Got so many matches that it makes me sick.
So many habits that I just can't kick.
So many women that I just can't trick.
She burnt like a candlestick.

But who's gonna save me from myself?
Gotta lay the blame on somebody else.

But somehow I ain't got no hope.
Cause I'm still runnin' from the sheriff's rope.
My shoes don't fit me cause they filled with dope.
Crow Jane quit me and I just can't cope.

But all I know is that I'll still run.
And pledge allegiance to the settin' sun.
I must've lost cause Crow Jane won.
I'll never learn from anything I've done.

Well Crow Jane ain't nothing but a painful case.
She left me sucking on my own disgrace.
She's off trucking at a cheatin' pace.
And a lawless life is all I can embrace.

Dress like a preacher so I can't be found.
Chase Crow Jane from town to town.
I smell her brain so she much be around.
Just like my pain, the sun goes down.

But who's gonna save me from myself?
Gotta lay the blame on someone else.

Somehow I ain't got no hope.
Cause I'm still runnin' from the sheriff's rope.
My shoes don't fit me cause they filled with dope.
Crow Jane quit me and I just can't cope.

But all I know is that I'll still run.
And pledge allegiance to the settin' sun.
I must've lost cause Crow Jane won.
I'll never learn from anything I've done.
