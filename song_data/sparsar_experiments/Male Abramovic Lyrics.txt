Male Abramovic Lyrics
by Yung Neptune (AKA YUNG JZ7).

Marina abramovic.
Im dat arena mulatto shit.
A theatre and drama bitch.
Possibly cotter it.

Drugs don't fly.
Only love soars.
Only get lit.
Cuz my heart stay bored.

Or rather I threw it overboard.
Abandoned random drowning in the ocean of life or love.
Or whatever holds me together.
Only stay floatin when there's wind in the weather.

Some days I'm a rock.
Fuck off I won't talk.
Inanimate and subordinate.
Cock my head to the Glock.

I want the thinking to stop.
ADHD driving me wild.
Till my neurons all rot.

Women and men find me entertaining.
I feel lonely and bored if I'm not feigning.
Jesting acts so people will act like I'm their friend.

Im a fucking alien.

I'm a stranger.
No soul.
Or horcrux.

A rabid dog.
Some roadkill.
My heart experienced torsion.

Collision of the world into my vision.

The psychotic bi optic lens of a livid villain.

But fuck it.
I guess I'll stay chiilin.
