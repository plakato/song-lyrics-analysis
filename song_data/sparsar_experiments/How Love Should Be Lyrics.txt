How Love Should Be Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Mobile woman buckle down your boots.
If you leave me what else can I do.
I've been a dancer, I've been a dancer all my life.
But I'm not dancing 'round this one tonight.
And I know I'd be doing fine.

Without you believin' in always picking up and thinking 'bout leaving.
Once you stick around then that's when I'll show you happiness the world can.
see.
That's how love should be.

I'm not asking I'm not on my knees.
But I'm not quite the knight I used* to be.
And I know I'd be better off.

Without you believin' in always picking up and thinking 'bout leaving.
Once you stick around then that's when I'll show you happiness the world can.
see.
That's how love should be.

I know I'm ready but for what's the hard part.
I'm being honest baby if you're right at home why move it on.

Without you believin' in always picking up and thinking 'bout leaving.
Once you stick around then that's when I'll show you happiness the world can.
see.
That's how love should be.
