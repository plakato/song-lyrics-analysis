Ballroom Blitz (remixed) Lyrics
by Sweet.

Are you ready, Steve? Uh-ha!
Andy? Yeah!
Mick? Okay.
All right, fellows, let's go!

Oh, it's been getting so hard.
Livin' with the things you do to me, ah-ha.
My dreams are getting so strange.
I'd like to tell you everything I see, mm.

Oh, I see a man at the back as a matter of fact.
His eyes are red as the sun.
And a girl in the corner, let no one ignore her.
Cause she thinks she's the passionate one.

Oh yeah, it was like lightning.
Everybody was frightening.
And the music was soothing.
And they all started grooving.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And the man at the back said: Everyone attack.
And it turned into a ballroom blitz.
And the girl in the corner said: Boy, I wanna warn ya.
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.

Oh, I'm reaching out for something.
Touching nothing's all I ever do.
Oh, I softly call you over.
When you appear, there's nothing left of you, ah-ha.

Now the man at the back is ready to crack.
As he raises his hands to the sky.
And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner.
She could kill you with a wink of her eye.

Oh yeah, it was electric.
So frantically hectic.
And the band started leaving.
Cause they all stopped breathing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And the man at the back said: Everyone attack.
And it turned into a ballroom blitz.
And the girl in the corner said: Boy, I wanna warn ya.
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.

Oh yeah, it was like lightning.
Everybody was frightening.
And the music was soothing.
Cause they all started grooving.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And the man at the back said: Everyone attack.
And it turned into a ballroom blitz.
And the girl in the corner said: Boy, I wanna warn ya.
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.
Ballroom blitz.

It's, it's a ballroom blitz.
It's, it's a ballroom blitz.
It's, it's a ballroom blitz.
Yeah, it's a ballroom blitz.
