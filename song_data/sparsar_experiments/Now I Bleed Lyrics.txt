Now I Bleed Lyrics
by Vision.

You don't know me, know me at all.
First I crumble, then I fall away:betrayed.
You can't see, you're mesmerized.
Too stubborn to compromise:I stay today.

You had me believe.
I never thought that you would leave.
And now I bleed.
I've got a sneaky suspicion I'm not your first.
It's intuition and someone's been cursed - it only gets worse.
Can't you see what's happening?
I'd have given anything to you - you know it's true.

You had me believe.
I never thought that you would leave.
And now I bleed.
There's nothing more that I can do.
You're not the friend that I once knew.
You don't know me, know me at all.
First I crumble, then I fall away, away.

You had me believe.
I never thought that you would leave.
And now I bleed.
