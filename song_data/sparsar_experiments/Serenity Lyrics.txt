Serenity Lyrics
by Twisted Artistics.

Rebekka B. Maeland 
 
I catch a wiff. I get a glipmse 
Short of breath. Some sort of treassure lies ahead, my head: it spins, 
Round and round round and round 
Overwealmed by what I've found 
At first. It seemed too good to be true. 
It has taken me all this time to let it shine through 
Building up inside of me the strength I need to set me free, 
I, lift my eyes, and now I see finally 
 
Sailing on the winds of change. 
The air is brushing underneath my wings 
Nothing, but the dream remains: 
Now life feels like the sweetest thing: X2 
 
Reminessing about the sound of my skateboard wheels on concrete 
 type of sound that'a. Make a boy feel complete. 
Those were the days when I ripped to shreds my pants and sweatshirts 
And left skin cells in random, concrete textures, 
When friends didn't do drugs and none of'em had nerves 
When to get hurt from landing head first 
Was. My main concern, never mind them. Gashes 
Let the pain burn. It makes you feel alive. Then 
Get up await your turn so that you can try again 
Untill. We came to learn how to land that trick. 
So you could be showing off representing the click. 
Bliss. Is this finally landing that first kick-flip 
Bliss? Is this olleying two trashcans and land to strike a pose 
No question? Bliss is moments like those 
Yes? I know what blood taste like 
See these shoes full of glue and ducktape laced tight, 
 
Sailing on the winds of change. 
The air is brushing underneath my wings 
Nothing, but the dream remains. 
Now life feels like the sweetest thing: X2
