Lifelines Lyrics
by A-ha.

One time to know that it's real, one time to know how it feels, that's all.
One call, your voice on the phone, one place, a moment alone, that's all.

What do you see? What do you know? One sign, what do I do?
Just follow your lifeline through.
What if it hurts? What then? What do we do? What do you say?
Don't throw your lifelines away.
Don't throw your lifelines away.

One time, just once in my life, yeah, one time to know it can happen twice.
One shot of a clear blue sky, one look, I see no reasons why we can't.

One chance to go back to the point where everything starts.
One chance to keep it together when things fall apart.
One sign to make us believe it's true.

What do you see? Where do we go? One sign, how do we grow?
By letting your lifelines show.
What if we do? What now? What do you say? How do I know?
Don't let your lifeline go.
Don't let your lifeline go.
Hah-ha.
Don't let your lifeline go.
Ha.
