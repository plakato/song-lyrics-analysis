Trench Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


What happened here. Talk 
Everytime, I slay me a man I feel awful 
I saw his mother slit her throat on the edge of his coffin 
You might feel different, but I don't got any problems. 
I got a iced-out trench with a safe full of solemn 
 
Anytime. A motherfucker fuck with me he fuckin' up 
Bitch. I don't give a fuck bitch. I can't give a fuck 
I'ma, get the urge to hunt him down and punch him in his face. 
Then I'ma take my blade and cut him where his heart stay. 
Every fuckin' goddamn day, I'm tryin' to stay away. 
From these weak fools cause. If I don't, I take, they lives away, 
I'm Genji as the dark bitch. I wish you would come start. 
Some bullshit with my squad lose your blood. If you hard 
Bitch, 
 
What 
I, don't need no rims up on the whip. I don't need no bitch up on my dick
 
I. Don'T need no gun to keep me safe, bitch. I don't even want to live
 
Go ahead and take my life. Show me that your not a lie 
Just make sure that if you do don't you leave Bones alive. 
Cause, I'm creepin' through the dark, Backwoods gettin' sparked 
Hope. My parents know that I love'em, but I got to play my part 
If. They want it. Take the aim, who am I to run away 
Show me that you really mean it when you say you got the K 
Got the Glock got the nine automatic with the scope 
Whatever you got just bring it to me. Turn me back into a ghost 
Boy. I bet that you ain't bangin' boy. I bet that you ain't slingin', 
You, just prayin' you just sayin', you ain't'bout it quit the playin
' 
Cause 
 
I. Don'T want to live, kill me if you wish 
Acting like you hard. We know you're, just a bitch 
I. Don'T want to live, kill me if you wish 
Acting like you hard. We know you're, just a bitch
