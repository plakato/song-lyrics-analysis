(Do the) Push and Pull Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.


Hey, everybody, Mister Rufus in town.
Came here to take care of business, ain't gonna mess around.
Now I got a brand new dance, that ain't no bull.
Everybody's doing it, we doing the push and pull.

I said, push, pull, push, pull.
Get on up, get on down.
Get on up.
Take it round and round.

I said, push, pull, push, pull.
Little bit more.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.

Lookie here.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.

Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.

Get out on the floor, you're gonna get left.
Get on your own, pretty baby, now go for yourself.
It's easier taking candy from a baby, don't hand me no bull.
Now you got it, baby you got that push and pull.

I said, push, pull.
Push, pull.
Listen get on up, get on down.
Get on up.
Take it round and round.

I said, push, pull, push, pull.
Listen.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.

Double upon.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.

Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.
Push it, pull it.
Ah.

Oh, Mister Clean and James Brown.
Everybody been messing around.
I'm doing a hundred and laying on full.
I got this thing talking 'bout push and pull.

I said, push, pull.
Push, pull, oh, ho.

Push and pull, oh, ho.
