R.U.I.N. Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


R-U to the I-N/.
So are you in? I'll know if you lying/.
Like a lazy boy in a Lazy Boy/.
If you're Jay-Z boy it don't phase me boy/.
Cause I'm a hypnotist with this swinging a pendulum /.
You're going do stuff you don't want to be doing son/.
Cause really I'm reckless/ I will be on heavy rotation.
For about  fifty million seconds! /.
So you can pick-up the reference/ on that last line/.
Like 30 AD this be way more than a past time/.
‘A Christian trying to be a Hiphop hoodlum?' /.
‘That's like Denzel Washington playing a Muslim' /.
Yeah like how the Earth is spherical, this also a fact/.
You want a lyrical MC that keeps content intact/.
So like the D12 cover on their album/.
I got the world in my palm and ain't nothing you can do about it! /.

Yeah Yeah, over a Just Blaze instrumental, I'll blench/.
Like Orion the stars are my championship belt/.
And who can loosen Orion's belt? Uh, I ask/.
Only God can stupid, two spins will prove it fast/.
I will be adorned with a heavenly robe/ that was sown/.
At my heavenly home/ adorned/ With more than gold/.
So I ain't got to own/ a pair Of Air Jordan Freshes to be.
A winner/ cause yeah I'll wear my mom's boots in the Winter/.
Cause my old 8th grade boots that were a lot like my shoes/.
My shoes were like my enemies, souls full of holes, shoot/.

I want change without robbing purses/ But first it's/.
I gotta throw change at those trying to rap/ who laugh at/.
My long ass Chad Kroeger hair, yeah I want my Nickelback/.
They tell me cash moves, but I got A Tribe Called Quest Advice/.
I don't need a statue to tell me that I'm nice/.
So I'm going Slaughterhouse, Jonestown.
massacre, damn/.
Letting all the Children Die, going harder.
than H.A.M./.
Black and Yellow, black and Yellow, it's how I fight/.
Give Wiz Khalifa a black eye, pee in the right/.
I'm kinda like Zuckerberg's best friend/ I'm not coming Back for my tiny.
percent/ I'm coming back for all of it! /.
I'm like a Sudoku/ you can try to play me but I'll.
Always confuse you/ “Who is you?” / name is.
R.U.I.N.! that's who/.
