R.U.I.N. Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


R-U to the I-N/ 
So. Are you in I'll know if you lying/ 
Like a lazy boy in a Lazy, Boy/, 
If, you're, Jay-Z boy, it don't phase me boy/ 
Cause, I'm a hypnotist. With this swinging, a pendulum, / 
You're going do stuff. You don't want to be doing son/ 
Cause, really, I'm reckless/. I will be on heavy rotation 
For about fifty million seconds. / 
So. You can pick-up the reference/ on that last line/, 
Like 30 AD. This be way more than a past time/ 
‘A Christian, trying to be a Hiphop hoodlum ?' / 
‘That's, like Denzel Washington, playing a Muslim' / 
Yeah like how the Earth is spherical. This also a fact/ 
You want a lyrical MC that keeps content. Intact/ 
So, like the D12 cover on their album/ 
I, got the world in my palm and ain't. Nothing you can do about it. / 
, 
Yeah Yeah over a Just Blaze, instrumental I'll blench/, 
Like Orion. The stars are my championship: belt/ 
And, who can loosen Orion's belt Uh, I ask/ 
Only, God can stupid. Two spins will prove it. Fast/ 
I will be adorned with a heavenly robe/ that was sown/ 
At, my heavenly home/ adorned/, With more than gold/ 
So. I ain't got to own/ a pair Of Air Jordan Freshes to be 
A, winner/ cause yeah I'll wear my mom's boots in the Winter/ 
Cause, my old 8th grade boots that were a lot like my shoes/ 
My shoes were, like my enemies, souls full of holes. Shoot/ 

I want change without robbing purses/, But first it's/ 
I got ta, throw change at those trying to rap/ who laugh at/, 
My long ass, Chad, Kroeger, hair yeah. I want my Nickelback/ 
They. Tell me cash moves, but I got A Tribe Called Quest. Advice/ 
I! Don'T need a statue to tell me that I'm nice/ 
So I'm going Slaughterhouse Jonestown
massacre damn/ 
Letting, all the Children Die going harder
than, H.A.M./, 
Black and Yellow black and Yellow it's how I fight/ 
Give Wiz Khalifa a black eye pee in the right/ 
I'm kinda, like Zuckerberg's best Friend/, I'm not coming Back for my tiny
percent/, I'm coming back for all of it. / 
I'm like a Sudoku/. You can try to play me but I'll 
Always confuse you/ “Who. Is you ” / name is
R.U.I.N.? That'S who/!
