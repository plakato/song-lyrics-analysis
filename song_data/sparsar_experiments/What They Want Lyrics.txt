What They Want Lyrics

They let us in the rap game.
I swear they let me in the motherfucking rap game.

Got a chick, I call her Lola.
She feel like the ocean.
Likes to drink and smoke some doja.
And I feel like smokin'.
Plus she good at charmin' cobras.
I feel like I'm chosen.
But she ain't the only one, no.
Got a chick, I call her Catia.
She be actin bougie.
The she came through and topped me off.
Now she just a groupie.
Got the aura of the mafia.
Her friends wish they knew me.
But they ain't the only ones, no no.

What they want, what they want, what they want.
Dollar signs, yeah, I know its what they want.
What they want, what they want, what they want.
Yall ain't foolin me at all.

I been at this shit for 9 years, now they startin' to call.
Im a DIY pioneer, they tryna get involved.
Yippee kiyay, aw yeah, 'bout to.
set it off.
I'm probably the only one yea.
Come correct when you approach me, I can size you up.
Takin all the shots like Kobe, almost 81.
Guess I gotta play the goalie and go and save me some.
I'm proabably the only one, ye-ah.

What they want, what they want, what they want.
Dollar signs, yeah, I know its what they want.
What they want, what they want, what they want.
Yall ain't foolin me at all.

Who wants my money, I'll tell you who I don't fuck with.
Who's pullin' strings, I'm just pointing out all the puppets.
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets.
I'm smart as fuck, they be talkin like I'm the dumbest.
But I know what they want from me.
Dollars, lotta stock in me.
It ain't nothin personal.
It's business and I'm a commodity.
But honestly, Pop Pop would be turnin' in his grave.
The day I let someone else become the boss of me.
When there's a boss in me, I'll be damned.

What they want, what they want, what they want.
Dollar signs, yeah, I know its what they want.
What they want, what they want, what they want.
Yall ain't foolin me at all.
