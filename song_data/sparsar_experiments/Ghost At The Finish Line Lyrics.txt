Ghost At The Finish Line Lyrics
by Quelle Chris.


Sometimes I be feeling like don't nobody love me.
Don't nobody love me, don't nobody love me.
Don't nobody really love me.
Hey, but I ain't make it that way.
Now when I get money everything will be OK.
Shit I ain't make it that way.
Now when I make money everything will be OK.

Now when I guap out everything will be OK.
Now when I rock out everything will be OK.
Now when I'm racked out everything will be OK.
Now when I act out everything will be OK.
Hey.

Shit I don't gotta be cool.
Spend a couple racks everybody comin' through.
Shit I ain't gotta be your friend.
I make a couple mil bet you call me again.
Shit I ain't gotta talk slick.
My money talk for me motherfucker I'm rich.
Shit I ain't make it that way.
Now when I get money everything will be OK.

Shit I ain't gotta be a nice guy.
Couple dope niggas that all write what I like.
I ain't gotta come around.
See me on TV I ain't gotta come around.
I ain't gotta be smooth.
Hold a couple D's, better put you in the mood baby.
I ain't make it that way.
Now when I get money everything will be OK.

Ghost at the finish line.
