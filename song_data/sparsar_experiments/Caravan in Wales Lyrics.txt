Caravan in Wales Lyrics
by The Wombats.

We're going on holiday.
So why have you got an array of board games under your arm?
What's the point in going somewhere else.
If you're only going to do exactly what you would be doing at home?
Looks like we're both in checkmate now.

Board games have a double meaning in this caravan in Wales.
You sink ships when we should be kissing.
Monopoly has thrown us in jail!

So stick the kettle on, so stick the kettle on!
Cos that's your get out call, your automatic response when everything is going.
wrong.
It was you who killed us in the bedroom with the lights on.

Board games have a double meaning in this caravan in Wales.
You sink ships when we should be kissing.
Monopoly has thrown us in jail!
Board games have a double meaning in this caravan in Wales.
You play Scrabble though we should be kissing.
Monopoly has thrown us in jail!

Looks like we're both in checkmate now......
