Freida on the Mountain Lyrics
by The Zolas.


Ever since you met me it's been nothing good.
Opposites attract in this neighbourhood.
Barking like a dog when no one is around.
Barking like a dog when no one is around.

Don't recognize myself, don't recognize my friends.
Potions getting heavier every weekend.
There's the thought of taking it all and evaporating.
Hide away and molting my hide.

Freida on the mountain.
What do you see on the other side?
Freida on the mountain.
What do you see on the other side?

All of the faders and all of the lights.
Can't tell me which way is right.
Gonna move to the blockade and divorce city sounds.
Gonna move to where the men are disembowelling the ground.
Draw a line up there in the oil instead of sucking it down.
I will find you in a lost cause.

All too amok chewing up these doldrums.
Floating alone in an ocean of friends.
All too amok chewing up these doldrums.
Floating alone in an ocean of friends.
