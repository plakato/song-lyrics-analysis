V-K! Lyrics

Produced By. Vo-Kal 
 
She wants someone that sings well. 
I got that 
Danger and thrill 
To top that 
The sin from my lips 
To make her drop down. 
And then pop that 
Just. Don'T stop that 
When you bust it open 
A, shy, girl, 
That's, so used to hoping 
For a savior 
From, her routine life 
To maximum exposure 
Someone to hold her 
Console her 
When times are rough 
But know her 
And show her 
That. I know 
That, she likes it. Rough 
Grip, her up 
Just suck it up. 
Punishment 
Don't, fuck it up. 
The pain, is her pleasure. 
But, the pain is what will fuck her up. 
Her skin is thick 
But. Her heart is thin 
And. It'S on her sleeve 
She gambling. 
The stakes are high. 
Just don't fall again: 
She felt the ground 
But. She won't again. 
She'Ll hold it in 
And, regret the past 
Regret, her love 
And, how it moved too fast 
That's. When I come to 
To remove the last 
Conception of me. 
She tried to pass 
As the real deal. 
I ain't that cold 
My words are smooth 
But, I'm way too old, 
To be playing games, 
And, be passing, notes 
Do, you like me now 
Check, yes or no 
To professional, 
My, confessional, 
I, don't live up 
To the rest of y'all 
You. Think V-K is 
Impressing. Y'All 
But, that's just how I come off. 
When I'm stressing y'all, 
, 
Already, 4am 
You know how it goes 
Where. Do we go from here, 
I'm too faded to know 
I'm, just hoping when you leave 
You'll, be saying my name 
Please remember my name. 
You can call me V-K 
It's, just one of those nights 
But. You know my songs, 
Please, don't assume shit, 
I'm already gone 
Just, maybe by tomorrow 
You'll be saying my name 
Or be singing. My name 
Please. Remember my name: 
My name, my name 
 
Look me in my eyes, 
Baby tell me you don't lie a bit 
I'm trying get in your mind. 
I'M trying see how tight those pants fit. 
I'M lying now, 
I can't sit 
And act like I'm 
Thirsty as fuck 
I know everyone else, 
They just stare at your butt. 
But me 
I, want to examine your cuts. 
The tears the tears 
The way you were broken down. 
Cause me 
My hearts, it's just swollen. Now 
And, it just looks like 
I'm so close to slowing down 
But, really it's code for more focus now 
So. Let'S know this now 
Who. Would you like to fall for 
Love in the hands of gentle man, 
Or lust in the clutch 
Of you trying to fuck 
Dance with devil 
In, the Mercedes truck 
Out in the open, 
Only stars can see us 
Bust your walls down 
And, take all of it back. 
The baggage, the past 
Put, it all in a stack 
Your past the baggage 
Take, all of it back 
Cause. I want all of you back 
I think you lost who coulda been 
And. I forgot about who 
All those bitches could have been 
The late nights, thinking, 
Sinking feelings, 
Spilling out my heart, 
They tore me apart now: 
I, don't know how to start now. 
Cause I'm falling apart now. 
I only know you through 
Instagram pics 
You, only know me 

So. I don't know where to start now. 
My whole message is falling apart now, 
Maybe your tumblr posts 
Shows, who you really are 
And. Maybe I'm really just meant to be a star. 
 
She wants someone that sings well 
Well. I can sing better with some shots in me. 
Just close your eyes and rock with me. 
Take it back. 
Don'T, stop 
Just trust. I sing well 
But. It would sound better if it was for you. 
I would do my best to spoil you 
Limited funds, but they for you, 
 
I know it's been a while 
I know that we never really talked 
But damn tonight. Your smile, 
Is, more than I ever could have thought. 
Who would have thought 
That stars aligned, 
Would bring us together here tonight. 
Destiny is a strong word to throw around 
So. Let'S just talk till it's right, 
I'm a little drunk 
Ok, I'm kinda faded, 
But right now. Let'S embrace the moment. 
And forget the time that I waited 
The time that I wasted 
When. It was you that was only in my sight. 
Just grab my hand for tonight. 
If, it all ends. Embrace me into the light. 
You cannot tell me this ain't right. 
This chemistry is level AP. 
Do my words come across as strong 
To stress everything that I see 
Everything, that I mean 
Subconsciously 
Your in my dreams, 
Add a dream girl to my dream: whip 
And. Let'S both forget reality, 
I still sing well 
And. I flow nice 
Let's, not talk about my salary. 
I'M, not superficial 
Just, better than most 
Self conscious, 
Let's make a toast 
To a crazy night. 
A more crazy life, 
It's 4 am 
Let's, say goodnight 
Cause, you know nothing. Good happens after 2. 
I can't ruin this beautiful night with you
