Collins HIll Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.


A poster-child of a delinquent faith.
You're a product of this dying age.

Beckoned by your fists.
Try to mask your shallow past.
These walls of holes have felt the fury.
Burning in your chest.

Crumbling the hopes of your happily ever after.
Heavy burdens have known me for a long time.
But growing up for you is a friend of mine.

And it's moments like these that I begin to.
Take you for what you're worth.
And I know that you'll never cease.
To fuck my hope, it's been this way since.
Before the birth.
And the harder I try.
The more you close your cynical eyes on.
Me and your pride.
But she's gonna know who you are.

A glitch in your cocaine dreams.
That you could never raise.
Fairy tales can't last forever.
This fantasy's a fucking tremor.

A carbon copy to the cliched waste.
You're becoming your father.
