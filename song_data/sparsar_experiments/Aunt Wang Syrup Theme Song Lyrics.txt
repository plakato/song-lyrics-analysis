Aunt Wang Syrup Theme Song Lyrics
by Tyler.

Tyler, The Creator 
I can't wait to take you home 
I've, been waiting all day to heat you up. 
Cover you in butter, 
Then I'ma drown you in syrup 
Go, 
, 
Interlude Tyler, The Creator and Kali Uchis 
I'm gon na eat. You alive, 
I'm gon na eat. You alive 
Woah you and I 
 
I'm gon na eat. You alive, 
Now you're gone 
Eat. You alive, 
I'm gon na eat, you alive, 
Gone gone gone, 
You're already gone, gone, gone, gone, 
Gone, 
And, I'm gone 
And, I'm gone, 
, 
 Tyler, The Creator. 
Aunt Wang will be my favorite forever 
I eat it. I drink it. I breathe it 
I'm down for whatever 
You fuck. With that bullshit 
But. I know that Aunt Wang's is better.
