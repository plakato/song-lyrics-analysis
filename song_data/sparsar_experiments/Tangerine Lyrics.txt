Tangerine Lyrics
by Sway Clarke II.


Sunset on La Rambla.
Blonde eyes and blue hair.
Funny how I remember after all of these years.
It was one, two moments darling you had all of me.
Me and you.

You would pose for the camera.
Smoke a spliff on the beach.
And I fell in love with your propaganda all those secrets you keep.
It was one, two moments darling you had all of me.
Can't you see?

The city looks so pretty out here on the beach.
Lullabies and dynamite come burn it down with me.
Tangerine.

Refrain.
She said we were always meant to fall in love.
She said we were always meant to fall in love.

Still in love Barcelona, do you remember we?
We left town on a motorbike a little high and naive.
But the years grew.
And that love, that strange, strange love.
Don't seem to feel so taboo.

The city looks so pretty out here on the beach.
Lullabies and dynamite come burn it down with me.
Tangerine.

Refrain.
Are you all in? Are you all in?
She said we were always meant to fall in love.
She said we were always meant to fall in love.
