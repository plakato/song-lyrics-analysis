No Beef Lyrics
by Yung G.


They don't want no beef they know wassup wit me.
These niggas tough up on the net but freeze up in them streetz.
That Pistol tucked ain't scared to bust if niggas fuck wit me.
These niggas always wanna talk but neva want no beef.

They don't want no beef they know wassup wit me.
I Catch a opp untuck the Glock and let the trigga squeeze.
I tell em meet me in the field no time fa Twitter beef.
Cuz if I catch u ima end yo L.I.F.E.

Ridin round wit my gun nigga want beef wit me is u dumb nigga my eyes.
Low from that blunt nigga run up and that gun sting em FMFB we field Niggas.

They don't want no beef they know wassup wit me.
These niggas tough up on the net but freeze up in them streetz.
That Pistol tucked ain't scared to bust if niggas fuck wit me.
These niggas always wanna talk but neva want no beef.
