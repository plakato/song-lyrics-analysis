Lighthouse Lyrics
by Voli.

Lyrics:.
I look for the rainbow after the rain goes.
It exists in your eyes, in your eyes.
Tell me my whole life.
Bring me ashore, ashore through the night.

Cuz you're my lighthouse even when the waves don't go my way.
Even when the ocean takes my legs.
Even in the dark, I see your face, it's better than a sunshine ray, oh oh oh.
Ladybug, you light my days, eh eh eh.

Uh, your smile holds the forecast, heh.
Your lips can make the storm pass.
You make it sunny when it's raining out.
Your body tells the time, the other clocks are slowly fading out.
My butterfly, my ladybug.
My baby's underneath the rainbow, she's my lady luck.
She understands me like no other can.
And in return, I choose to love her like no other man.
Uh, you simplify me when I'm complicated.
You take my breath away, you confiscate it.
And give it back to pull me up when I was on the ground.
Funny, you're also my gravity, cuz you hold me down.
And you don't ask for much, that's the irony, girl.
You only want my heart, for that, I'll buy the world.
So let me celebrate your name, baby.
The light you shine upon me is my everything, baby.

Hey, baby, look at where we are, look at where we started from.
This relationship turned out better than how we thought it would.
Started out as college love.
Shaky as the bottle of a baby, guess that's why it sucked, but somehow we rise.
above.
Every time when others disappointment me, you're my constant.
So even when I'm gone, you're on my mind like my conscience.
My best friend, my baby pie.
My princess, my Lady Di.
Now, let the roaming heart go home and find its way ashore.
And home is under the covers, and we don't have to go nowhere, baby, no one.
can bug us here.
And we can light the stars the way we used to long before.
So let me celebrate your name, baby.
The light you shine upon me is my everything, baby.
