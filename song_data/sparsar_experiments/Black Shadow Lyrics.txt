Black Shadow Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Poison to your eyes to reduce brainsize.
To discern no black lies they feed up on you.
They try to disable your soul of being stable.
Like the wolf in the fable to devour your heart.

On and on the blakish world to come.
Codes and signs until resistance is done.

Just keep on fighting while the devious is hiding.
Right in the darkness to spy up on you.
Awaiting the right time to break of the nightline.
Silencing your mind to creep on your soul.
The black shadow.

All getting virtual, new worlders' black fuel.
Omnipresent school to form out new man.
Chemical food inc., genetic waste bin.
Pulling the worlds' strings to burn out its soul.

On and on the blakish world to come.
Codes and signs until resistance is done.

Just keep on fighting while the devious is hiding.
Right in the darkness to spy up on you.
Awaiting the right time to break of the nightline.
Silencing your mind to creep on your soul.
The black shadow.

Excess all over, all whipped by the drover.
Slavery's closer than ever before.
Oil to the fire, a gigantic pyre.
A fiest to the liar cause they're all taken in.

On and on the blakish world to come.
Codes and signs until resistance is done.

Just keep on fighting while the devious is hiding.
Right in the darkness to spy up on you.
Awaiting the right time to break of the nightline.
Silencing your mind to creep on your soul.
The black shadow.
