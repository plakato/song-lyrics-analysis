Fall Back Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

In the dark I feel around me.
In the clouded mess, you surround me.
I am not afraid to let go.
Of all the history that pushed me over.
My home.
In the waking night I hold you.
So close.
You are my only one.
You are my only one.
Forever, forever.
Forever, forever.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
Forever, forever.
Fall back.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
Forever, forever.
Fall back.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
I would do anything to be the one with you.
I would do anything to be the one for ever.
Fall back.
Fall back.
Fall back.
Fall back.
