Creep Lyrics
by Twistid Rob.


I've done horrible things, they're hard to explain.
I can do them again, cause I know the pain.
Inside my hurt, that I do it day to day.
It's causing me to chop constantly in a dope way.
I've been labeled a creep, they've called me a freak pointing fingers at me.
Calling me weak, what they don't know is I gotta eat.
Twistid Vaurheaz and Chadrick bon apetite.

I feel like my mind is tossed up, lost in a world of corruption.
Assumptions of people I don't even trust them, I'm not accustomed.
Gotta stay humble but what's been circling my brain, Is a reality I'm all.
chains.
So I gotta stay weird and strange, doing thangs.
Digging up the remains of the memories of the slappers that bang.
Hit the speakers to the streets, the tracks that I've slain.
You motherfuckers doggin me cause my style ain't yours, behind closed doors.
you're loving my shit.
I can hear you from the bottom, quit makin appraisal of it.
I've seen some shit, knee deep in it for the key to it.
I've walked and preceed with thick measures, I've bleed to it.
Mentality of a beast, I can't ease my ways I go dark but I'm pleased.
That I'll free up the hatred I conceived, I can't sleep.
When I speak this lethal perceptual aim, from the hidden sleeve.
It's volatile that you 'pretiate, what you eat.
You fuckin pussies not even on my level the beef, I got shit settled I meddled.
I've won battles I'm the black sheep.

I've done horrible things, they're hard to explain.
I can do them again, cause I know the pain.
Inside my hurt, that I do it day to day.
It's causing me to chop constantly in a dope way.
I've been labeled a creep, they've called me a freak pointing fingers at me.
Calling me weak, what they don't know is I gotta eat.
Twistid Vaurheaz and Chadrick, bon apetite.

Hope you locked your front door, cause I came ready for war.
Strapped up get clapped up, brain matter on floors.
Not talkin about bullets Im talkin about bars, not really.. gonna kill you I'm.
speakin in metaphors.
Lyrically I could dismantle you first I rip off your arms, proceed to beat the.
shit out of you then stand over your corpse.
Pants down take a shit, take a big shit and laugh, wipe my ass with your cash.
you walked off.
Ima fuckin asshole ima basterd ima jack off on your wife's corpse to walk in.
To your casket, slip and notice I ejact it with twittish rappers, two for me.
none for you.
That was fuckin brutal, but it's part of me.
Got demons in my head pumping through my arteries.
I beast then blessed me if I didn't make them part of my artistry.
Fire on the beats, start a fire in the streets, more fire us sprinkle in the.
keif.
Light it up, inhale ima beast, your priorities are between the sheets.
Position bride ima sell a bit, Ive just fucked beats like dirk lewinsky.
Hittin 3's, burn the booth that arseny.

I've done horrible things, they're hard to explain.
I can do them again, cause I know the pain.
Inside my hurt, that I do it day to day.
It's causing me to chop constantly in a dope way.
I've been labeled a creep, they've called me a freak pointing fingers at me.
Calling me weak, what they don't know is I gotta eat.
Twistid Vaurheaz and Chadrick, bon apetite.

I'm driven by eyers spittin this fire, optical syllable prodigals fire.
Probable liars stopping at nothin I'm coming so cuttin em out of the dire.
Need of hella weed persetital breathe, hoping it's getting me higher.
But I'm really thinking my mind is rewired, I get tired.
Then I'm waking up and I feel alone, must be a dream my mind is gone.
Venom in my veins can a man be wrong? I feel the motherfucker urt in my bones.
And I can't get away got a life that I'm in, give me a purpose to make a new.
day.
I'ma weird ass creep and I'm here to stay, with a motherfuckin motive to chop.
your face.
Look at my clothes line peer a red, motions I show it I've already bled.
Sweat in my tears of my everyday living, you ain't gettin ahead.
I'm swinging from fences, staying professional.
Hit em with heaviness, multi-directional.
Lyrical savage i cut em a sectional.
Plug in my stereo's make it acceptable.
From the cracks and crevices this underground movement, putting rappers on my.
beats I met in the streets you motherfuckers gettin stupid.
Makin music bout nothing you confused about what the truth is, when it comes.
to real shit you motherfuckers act clueless.

I've done horrible things, they're hard to explain.
I can do them again, cause I know the pain.
Inside my hurt, that I do it day to day.
It's causing me to chop constantly in a dope way.
I've been labeled a creep, they've called me a freak pointing fingers at me.
Calling me weak, what they don't know is I gotta eat.
Twistid Vaurheaz and Chadrick, bon apetite.
