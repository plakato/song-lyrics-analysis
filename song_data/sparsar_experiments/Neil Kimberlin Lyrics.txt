Neil Kimberlin Lyrics
by 4AM.


Like go head. Talk! Your shit, 
Go head talk, your shit 
All! That shit is bush 
We ain't'. On that grass we on that bush, 
 
I rock the all black double on some free base. Shit 
My girl went 0-100. I still got a base-hit 
My blunderbuss is looping, 
Looping koopas, kicking it in world. Three 
My world seems i'm living three lives all in the same scene. 
God, damn 
, 
Go head talk! Your shit, 
Go head talk your shit 
All. That shit is bush 
We ain't' on that grass. We on that bush 
 
That shit is bush 
Talking, the bush of Riley Reid 
That shit is bush 
The running back for USC 
Im, just trying to be or not to be those knock off Nikes on my feet. 
Those, Dark Knight become Dents 
After rent's due 
Check, my notepad 
My notes had 
Those throwbacks before the nomads 
You check, all the kodaks 
Was the man. I wrote the program 
Swear my C.D made D.C 
Kick into martial law. 
Cause kick like it's. Martial arts just makes sure no one's dropping pants to
pass 
And. Now we got suspenders for all those shoulders and should've beens 
Yeah Four 
You know all that shit is bush 
Yeah. You know all that shit is bush. Four 
 
That shit is bush 
Talking, the bush of Riley Reid 
That shit is bush 
The running back for USC 
The president in 03', who knows the 
Execution nose bleed seats, 
And he'll get that shit for cheap. That shit is bush, 
, 
The, tradition of extradition forgot to mention. 
I got a lady and she love to tattle. 
They just want some beef. They want some cattle 
Eat your lunch and leave your plate up on the mantle 
We saw Mr. 3000 up the creek. Without a paddle 
Now that shit's a puddle 
Claim, they so subtle, 
What they telling us 
Tweets about they. Obliques 
Just make the youth feel so unique. 
I got the God complex, 
No, Mother, Mary 
Cap. The G 
Asking me why teachers never passing me 
These Nikes on my feet: 
Only compete in context, 
That's, never complete 
But. Yet I rock the God complex around my neck 
Wicked witch of west. She snatch my tie 
We wonder why 
Those flowers always die 
Oh. My 
 
All that shit is bush. 
You know all that shit is bush. 
You know all that shit is bush 
We ain't' on that grass we on that bush, 
 
In, the essence of Escobar 
Only goes so far: 
Sampling some Mozart, 
On, the mound 
Catch, the Bach 
Now, we're back to bae. 
The token told em' 
Hold up man. What'S the hold up, 
We ain't' got no love from the kids off towards Hogwarts 
They kept my clipped chords, 
They wish for more 
They. Listen for 
4AM 
Claiming, some confidence as an accomplishment 
The prophet spitting for profit. 
Won'T, stop till i'm in that coffin shit is bush.
