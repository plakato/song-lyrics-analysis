Neil Kimberlin Lyrics
by 4AM.


Like go head talk your shit.
Go head talk your shit.
All that shit is bush.
We ain't' on that grass we on that bush.

I rock the all black double on some free base shit.
My girl went 0-100, I still got a base-hit.
My blunderbuss is looping.
Looping koopas, kicking it in world three.
My world seems, i'm living three lives all in the same scene.
God damn.

Go head talk your shit.
Go head talk your shit.
All that shit is bush.
We ain't' on that grass we on that bush.

That shit is bush.
Talking the bush of Riley Reid.
That shit is bush.
The running back for USC.
Im just trying to be or not to be those knock off Nikes on my feet.
Those Dark Knight become Dents.
After rent's due.
Check my notepad.
My notes had.
Those throwbacks before the nomads.
You check all the kodaks.
Was the man I wrote the program.
Swear my C.D made D.C.
Kick into martial law.
Cause kick like it's martial arts just makes sure no one's dropping pants to.
pass.
And now we got suspenders for all those shoulders and should've beens.
Yeah, Four.
You know all that shit is bush.
Yeah, you know all that shit is bush Four.

That shit is bush.
Talking the bush of Riley Reid.
That shit is bush.
The running back for USC.
The president in 03' who knows the.
Execution nose bleed seats.
And he'll get that shit for cheap that shit is bush.

The tradition of extradition forgot to mention.
I got a lady and she love to tattle.
They just want some beef they want some cattle.
Eat your lunch and leave your plate up on the mantle.
We saw Mr. 3000 up the creek without a paddle.
Now that shit's a puddle.
Claim they so subtle.
What they telling us.
Tweets about they obliques.
Just make the youth feel so unique.
I got the God complex.
No Mother Mary.
Cap the G.
Asking me why teachers never passing me.
These Nikes on my feet.
Only compete in context.
That's never complete.
But yet I rock the God complex around my neck.
Wicked witch of west she snatch my tie.
We wonder why.
Those flowers always die.
Oh my.

All that shit is bush.
You know all that shit is bush.
You know all that shit is bush.
We ain't' on that grass we on that bush.

In the essence of Escobar.
Only goes so far.
Sampling some Mozart.
On the mound.
Catch the Bach.
Now we're back to bae.
The token told em'.
Hold up, man what's the hold up.
We ain't' got no love from the kids off towards Hogwarts.
They kept my clipped chords.
They wish for more.
They listen for.
4AM.
Claiming some confidence as an accomplishment.
The prophet spitting for profit.
Won't stop till i'm in that coffin shit is bush.
