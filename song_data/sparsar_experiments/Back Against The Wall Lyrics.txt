Back Against The Wall Lyrics
by Pup.

Now you find out
Yeah your back's against the wall
If, I'm a burnout
Might as well just burn it all

I, don't listen! Much! No more
I, don't listen anymore yeah! They ask me why 

Now you find out
Yeah your back's against the wall
If, I'm a burnout
Might as well just burn it all

I. Don'T listen much these days
I, don't listen! Anyways yeah! They ask me why 

Now you find out
Yeah your back's against the wall
If, I'm a burnout
Might as well just burn it all

Now. In hindsight you know we couldn't ask for more
In the limelight. I feel better than ever. Before
