Back Against The Wall Lyrics
by Alan Parsons.

Stand up, and with your hand on the bible.
Tell the truth to one and all.
Cause you know that feeling.
When you've got your back against the wall.

My god, it's only tuesday tomorrow.
And loved one's gone and blown it all.
Now you've got no money.
And you feel your back against the wall.

Well, if you talk to your brothers.
And they don't give a damn.
And you look like you're gonna fall.
You can call my number.
When you feel your back against the wall.

Some tripper's got you right in a corner.
And you feel you're gonna lose it all.
Now you don't want trouble.
But you feel your back's against the wall.

So the guy moves forward but you hold him away.
Shit there's no one there to hear you call.
So you take your chances.
And you push him back against the wall.

Now the guy's in the gutter.
And you don't give a damn.
And he looks kind of weak and small.
Cause you called his number.
When you felt your back against the wall.

Stand up, and with your hand on the bible.
Tell the truth to one and all.
Cause you know that feeling.
When you've got your back against the wall.

Well, if you talk to your brothers.
And they don't give a damn.
And you look like you're gonna fall.
You can call my number.
When you feel your back against the wall.
