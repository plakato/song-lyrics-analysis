Casablanca Lyrics
by Xandria.

At the temple of black gods i failed again.
For you - a chilvarous end for a man.
Clandestine enthralling haze.
A docile sacrifice for your grace.
Resurrect from the ban they put on you.
Fall again - you will - what they foreknew.
Only gods illuminate.
And just a slave to be is my fate.
And you will hear me.
Siren's calls of temptation.
Teasing you.
No limit will be.
No taboo of imagination.
I'll fill your void.
I will always savour you.
As i will always be your fool.
