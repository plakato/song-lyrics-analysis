DVP Lyrics
by Pup.


Your sister thinks that I'm a freak
She's been ignoring my calls. We haven't spoken in a week
I, get so drunk that I can't speak
Yeah nothing's working and the future's looking bleak, and I say

Three beers and I'm so messed up get drunk, and I can't shut up
She says that I drink too much
I fucked up and she hates my guts
She Says that I need to grow up

I'm talking fast to get away
Doing 180 on the Don Valley. Parkway
Yeah I'd be better off dead
I, don't give a shit, I just don't wan na die and I don't want to live. I said

Three beers and I'm so messed up get drunk and I can't shut up
She says that I drink too much
I fucked up and she hates my guts
She says that I need to grow. Up

I'Ll drink'till, I'm staring at the ceiling, 
I'll be just fine. I gon na' be losing feeling 
I can't tell lies anymore, 

Three beers and I'm so messed up get drunk, and I can't shut up
She says that I drink too much
Fucked up cause. She hates my guts

I. Just don't know what to do. I'M still fucked up over you
She says that I drink too much
Hawaiian red fruit punch. 
She says I need to grow. Up
