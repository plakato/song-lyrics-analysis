Pony Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Something surrounds me.

The space at the ocean shore.

The white crash of the waves.

Accepting our weakness.

There's nothing that says be strong.

Of strength i'm ashamed.

It's all i know.

It pulls my way.

It seems.

Accepting our weakness.

There's nothing that says be strong.

Of strength i'm afraid.
