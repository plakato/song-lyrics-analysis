And I ain't leaving out the county till the bills done  .

Very important person, Quilly not anybody  .
She been with a lot of hittas, but never the real one  .
She want a deep boy, she want a real one  .
Giuseppe, Fendi baby, Ferragamo  .
Im a take her to out while she tired of McDonalds  .
She tired of these lames, she tired of these frauds  .
She said she want a real one, come ride with a boss  .
  .
She gon buss it for a real one  .
She gonn pop it, she gon drop it for a real one  .
She said she met a hitta and never met the real one  .
Now put ya bottles in the air if you a real one  .
Streets love me im a real one  .
Got everybody fuckin with me im a real one  .
Now who the hottest in the city, Im the real one  .
Now put ya bottles in the air if you a real one  .

I got a presidential Rollie its a real one  .
My bitch ass fat, its a real one  .
And if she buss it open, throw some real ones  .
I got the f'n wit the 30 its a real gun  .
I knew I was a real one since a youngin  .
I grew up in the projects, now look at how im stuntin'  .
I started with a onion now i got a lot of cousins  .
And them bitches they was frontin' now they buggin' cause im buzzin, But i.
treat it like its nothin  .
Prolly cuz im a real one  .
I came in the game real when im still one  .
Now shoutout to my day one's, they the real ones  .
They be the same hittas with me when the deal comes  .
  .
She gon buss it for a real one  .
She gonn pop it, she gon drop it for a real one  .
She said she met a hitta and never met the real one  .
Now put ya bottles in the air if you a real one  .
Streets love me im a real one  .
Got everybody fuckin with me im a real one  .
Now who the hottest in the city, Im the real one  .
Now put ya bottles in the air if you a real one.
