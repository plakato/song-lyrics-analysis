I Can't Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


I wonder if she lays awake at night.
And thinks about what we had.
Every now and then I'm haunted by tears.
I wish you didn't leave like that.
I know I should let her go but I can't.

I wish I could call and say.
I think we made a big mistake.
I'm sorry for everything.
But too many nights have gone by.
I wish I could take her hand.
And tell her I want one more chance.
She's probably moved on by now.
But I can't.

I keep myself busy all the time.
To stop my mind from wandering, yeah.
I wonder if he misses holding me.
Like I miss holding him.
I could lie to myself and say I don't want him back.
I know I should let him go but I can't.

How could we have thrown our love away.
I can't live one more hour one more day.
Without you, without you.
By my side.

No I can'tx2.
