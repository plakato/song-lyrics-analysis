Africa Lyrics
by Zo!.

* song originally done by Toto.

Phonte.
I hear the drums echoing tonight.
But she hears only whispers.
Of some quiet conversaaaaation....
She's coming in 12:30 flight.
The moonlit wings reflect the stars.
That guide me towards salvaaaaation....
I stopped an old man along the way.
Hoping to find some long forgotten words.
Or ancient mellllllodies.....
He turned to me as if to say.
Hurry boy, it's waiting there for yooooou!

It's gonna take a lot to drag me awaaaaay from you.
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever doooo...
I bless the rains down in Af-ricaaaa...
Gonna take some time to do the things we never haaaaaaaaaaad, ooh, ooh....

The wilddogs cry out in the night.
As they grow restless longing.
For some solitary coooompany....
I know that I must do whats right.
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus.
Above the Serengetiii....
I seek to cure what's DEEP inside.
Frightened of, this thing that I've becoooome.

Synthesized keyboard break.

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for yooooou!

It's gonna take a lot to drag me awaaaaay from you.
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever doooo...
I bless the rains down in Af-ricaaaa...
I bless the rains down in Af-ricaaaa...
I bless the rains down in Af-ricaaaa...
I bless the rains down in Af-ricaaaa...
I bless the rains down in Af-ricaaaa...
Gonna take some time to do the things we never haaaaaaaaaaad, ooh, ooh....

Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-bum....
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-bum....
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-bum....
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-bum....

And I can't wait, to see you baby.
I'm, coming home to you.
Ooh, I got to see her, I got to see her.
Cause I'm coming home to you, BA-bay....
Ooooh, when I just can't wait to see you,.
yeah....
And I can't wait to see you there...
Right there WAITING for you...
Oh, I want to see you, ohh....
Whatchu doing to meeee...
Really wanna see you, baby..ey...
Come a little closer.. *chuckles*.
Don't say goodbye...

Woo!

Um, God bless the rains down in Africa.
God bless the rains down in Africa.
God bless the rains down in Africa.
God bless the rains down in Africa.
God bless the rains down in Africa.

Lord blessing the rains, down, in Africa.
