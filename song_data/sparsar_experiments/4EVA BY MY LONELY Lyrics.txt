4EVA BY MY LONELY Lyrics
by Black Kray.


Icy diamonds, I be coolin.
Money stack long like a ruler.
Goth shawty, seat up, said she coolin.
Ride around town, I go coolin.

Counting diamonds I be coolin.
Money short like a ruler.
Smokin mid, got me coolin.
Goth shawty, seat up, said she coolin.
Shawty wearin diamond, I be coolin.
How Black Kray be coolin he be foolin.
Foreign diamond icy got me coolin.
Phone off forever coolin.
Now I hit the blunt, nigga good.
Diamonds drippin, lookin like some sewage.
Folks all think that I'm boolin.
Countin money with the Uzi.

Counting diamonds I be coolin.
Money short like a ruler.
Smokin mid, got me coolin.
Goth shawty, seat up, said she coolin.
Shawty wearin diamond, I be coolin.
