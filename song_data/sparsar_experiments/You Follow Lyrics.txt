You Follow Lyrics
by Zinc.

I'Ll lead you follow.., i lead you follow. I remember the days in the
park. We used to hide together, doing things that we both whooooooa, you let me
lead and then you follow. ..whoooooooa.. I knew that you would find
your way. I knew you would find your way home.. I remember the day we met it. Was
So bright outside. I coulnd't believe my eyes that whooooooa. you let me lead
and. Then you follow ... .... I knew that you would find your way to me.
i knew that you would find your way to me
