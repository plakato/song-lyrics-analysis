You Follow Lyrics
by Zinc.

I'll lead you follow.. i lead you follow  i remember the days in the.
park we used to hide together doing things that we both whooooooa,you let me.
lead and then you follow. ..whoooooooa. i knew that you would find.
your way i knew you would find your way home. i remember the day we met it was.
so bright outside i coulnd't believe my eyes that whooooooa. you let me lead.
and then you follow....... i knew that you would find your way to me..
i knew that you would find your way to me.
