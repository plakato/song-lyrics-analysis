In the Name Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

A music revolution taking place!
Yes man.
This is Teba straight outa Afrika cape Town city.
There bout ya along side.
Sweet Noise ya ear me.
Yes man.
A serious business we ya deal wit musically ya ear me.
Yes man.
Watch we now style.
Ita gwaan so ey.

World people.
6 million ways to die.
We ya chose non of them why.
Babylon them have fe fall.
Sweet Noise and Teba na go cry!

I dig this dirt for a woman and man.
I dig this dirt for a silent blame.
And the lost names.
Pride.
Love.
The lost soul.
Who's above you.
No one just an empty money can.
Dropping bombs on my fellow men.
And a screaming child.
The old man stands.
Singing songs.
Of a freedom in the name.

In the name.
In the name of a man.
In the name.
In the name of my men.

U.N.I.T.Y is fe unity.
But wicked man thema killing community.

Fugitives running.
True rebel dying.
They slaughter beauty.
But the street still not crying - no.

I see the president.
Spit on the holly graves.
Nations blind.
Following The dead trace.
Saw a child being trained to be a killer man.
Tears in eyes.
Guns in the little hands.
Missing brother.
Grave of his father.
Empty eyes, what you've done to his mother.

In the name.
In the name of a man.
In the name.
In the name of my men.

Hey homosepiens hey human species.
Have fe stop this war ita go break we to to pieces.
Tired fe see the youth wit wolipa stichies.
Babylon suck we blood just like stichies.

I gave this little moment to my self.
This precious little time just for myself.
And I drop this angry burning words.
On a red doted line.
Guess who's lonely.
Guess who's lonely.

I'll dig this dirt for the woman and a man.
For the love and pain, and a killing will.
Not that fucked up dirty, will to kill.
Do you know what I mean?
You know....

Their exploding cars.
Their waiting bombs.
The bleeding land.
The eyes that hate.
I saw man kill in the name of god.
So high above.
My world was crying.

Screaming child.
Screaming for the lie.
The exploding gun.
Tears my beauty open.
Scream for me.
Scream!
My child.

Scream!
Scream for me.
Scream!
Scream for me.
Scream for me!
My child!

Freedom.
My freedom.
Freedom.
In the name in the name of my man.
In the name in the name of my man.
I demand freedom in the name.
Of my dignity.
Respect, respect, respect me.
Respect, respect, respect me.
Scream for me.
My screaming child.

Scream for me.
And I'll tear this world apart for you.
My child....
