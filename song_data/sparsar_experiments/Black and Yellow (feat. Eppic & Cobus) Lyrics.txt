Black and Yellow (feat. Eppic & Cobus) Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is.
Black and yellow x4.
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is.
Black and yellow x4.

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is.
Everything I do, I do it big.
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing.
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting.
Repping my town when you see me you know everything.
Black and yellow x4.
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in.
Black and yellow x4.

Black stripe, yellow paint, them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't.
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face.
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake.
Suede inside, my engine roaring.
It's the big boy, you know what I payed for it.
And I got the pedal to the metal.
I got you niggas checking game I'm balling out on every level.
Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell 'em.
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule.
No love for 'em nigga breaking hearts.
No keys, push to start.

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is.
Everything I do, I do it big.
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing.
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting.
Repping my town when you see me you know everything.
Black and yellow x4.
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in.
Black and yellow x4.

Got a call from my jeweler, this just in.
Bitches love me cause I'm fucking with their best friends.
Not a lesbian but she a freak though.
This ain't for one night I'm shining all weak hoe.
I'm sipping cleeko and rocking yellow diamonds.
So many rocks up in the watch I can't tell what the time is.
Got a pocket full of big faces.
Throw it up cause every nigga that I'm with Taylor.

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is.
Everything I do, I do it big.
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing.
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting.
Repping my town when you see me you know everything.
Black and yellow x4.
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in.
Black and yellow x4.

Stay high like how I'm supposed to do.
That crown underneath them clouds, can't get close to you.
And my car look unapproachable.
Super clean but its super mean.
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks, get fly, take trips.
and that's that.
Real rap, I let her get high, she wouldn't she feel that, convertible drop.
fill, 87 the top peel back.

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is.
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is.
Repping my town when you see me you know everything.
Black and yellow x4.
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in.
Black and yellow x4.
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is.
Everything I do, I do it big.
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing.
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting.
Repping my town when you see me you know everything.
Black and yellow x4.
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in.
Black and yellow x4.
