Check 'Em Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


Who dat call the police.
Yo ma called the police.
I got five on the lips.
But I ain't payin for the ass.
You just got yo hair fixed.
So can you pump a nigga gas.
Now when you ridin in my truck can you pick a nigga dick.
I got a boonapolist so can you be my trick.
C-Murder called you hoes like some fuckin crash dummies.
It ain't love when the motherfucking sex cost money.
I ain't dissin you hoes.
I just don't love you hoes.
In yo raggedy ass Girbauds.
When you swangin on them poles.
Now if you trippin then you know you livin trife.
And if you dippin I can't put you in my life.
Cause all hoes suck dick.
Let me tell you dog hoes you fuckin with.
See i don't play no games and i don't sweat no hoes.
Well bitch take off your clothes.
Talk that shit now roll with it.
Ya warefare check hoe go get it.

Check dem hoes.
Check dem niggas.

Check dem hoes nigga is you crazy.
You can stunt all you want but that shit don't phase me.
in front yo boys like you made me nigga.
I hold my own ????????
Reppin like you gon shine.
Nigga you is a waste of time.
Gettin that ho to step to me.
I gets down for mine.
Me and my girls we don't play no games.
Fuck you lames.
When you walkin on side of me.
I'm bringin you pain.
You can talk that shit about suck yo dick.
Get a grip.
Broke bitch you ain't the shit.
You know who you fuckin wit.
Drop a baby for you.
Nigga you must be sick.
Got no time for the lies all niggas is tricks.

Who dat call the police.
Yo ma called the police.
Who dat call the police.
Yo pa call the police.
Dem hoes call the police.
Dem niggas call the police.
Check dem hoes.
Check dem niggas.
Talk that shit now roll wit it.
Yo warefare check ho go get it.
