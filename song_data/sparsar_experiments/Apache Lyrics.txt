Apache Lyrics
by Ruse.

I'm sticking out like a shout on the sideline.
Hot on the spot, gonna let it show.
Soft leather skirt and your beat up stockings.
You're stuck with your luck and your luck is low.
Roll me over.
Roll me with those white eyes.
Well you say this world spins too slow.
And we know this love has just been sold.
Hey goldilocks on the clock in your castle.
Boat for the moat, throw down your hair.
Ride up the vine an electric skyline.
Follow the trail, you don't know where.
Let it go.
Let it go, it's a life line.
You say this world spins too slow.
And we know this love has just been sold.
