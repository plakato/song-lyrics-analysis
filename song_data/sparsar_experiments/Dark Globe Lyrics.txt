Dark Globe Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.


Oh where are you now.
Pussy willow that smiled on this leaf?
When I was alone you promised the stone from your heart.
My head kissed the ground.

I was half the way down, treading the sand.
Please, please, lift a hand.

I'm only a person whose armbands beat.
On his hands, hang tall.
Won't you miss me?
Wouldn't you miss me at all?
The poppy birds way.
Swing twigs coffee brands around.
Brandish her wand with a feathery tongue.
My head kissed the ground.

I'm only a person with Eskimo chain.
I tattooed my brain all the way.
Won't you miss me?
Wouldn't you miss me at all?
