Amy Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Produced By Ethan Johns.

I don't know why I let go.
I want to be your friend.
Flowers grow through my window and I love you again.
Oh I love you oh.
When you laid me down into your beautiful garden.
Flowers in the love of my arms.
Its God shining through to me I guess.

Its God shining through to me I guess.
I love you Amy.

Do you still love me.
I go to the places where we used to.
I feel sad.
I am out here looking for you.

Sometimes I pretend.
Oh I miss you oh.
When you laid me down.
Into your beautiful garden.
Flowers and the love in my arms.
Is God playing evil tricks on me.

Is God playing evil tricks on me.
Oh I love you Amy.

Do you still love me.
