Along In The Sun And The Rain Lyrics
by Woodie Guthrie.

Along in the sun and the rain.
Along in the sun and the rain.
Long oh long oh long oh long.
Along in the sun and the rain.

Hey, boys, I've come a long ways.
Well, boys, I've come a long ways.
Oh boys, I've come a long lonesome ways.
Along in the sun and the rain.

I seen a whole lot of things.
I seen a whole lot of things.
Yes oh yes, well a whole lot of things.
Along in the sun and the rain.

I kissed a whole lot of lips.
I've kissed a whole lot of lips.
Lord oh lordy, and a whole lot of lips.
Along in the sun and the rain.

I've seen a lot of towns.
I've seen a lot of towns.
I've seen a lot of towns.
Along in the sun and the rain.

I've had a lot of fights.
I've had a lot of fights.
I've had a lot of fights, man.
Along in the sun and the rain.

Along in the sun and the rain.

I'm gonna get my job done.
I'm gonna get my job done.
I'm gonna get my job done, oh done.
Along in the sun and the rain.
