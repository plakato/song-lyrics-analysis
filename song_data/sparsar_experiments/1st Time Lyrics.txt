1st Time Lyrics
by Yung Joc.


Hey love .... You remember your first time: 
Get dat with a real nigga Heh heh heh 
Well. Let'S talk about it. 
 
It ain't nothin, like the first time, 
I'm tryin, to tell you. I can blow your mind 
Baby. If I touch you here and kiss you, there, 
 Gon na fall in love, shorty best! Beware: 
There ain't nothin, like the first time, 
I'm tryin, to tell you. I can blow your mind 
Baby. If I touch you here and kiss you there, 
 Gon na fall in love. Shorty, you best! Beware: 
 
Ah hold on this ain't! No love song mo', like a cut song, 
You, say your day was long well tell daddy! What'S wrong! 
I'Mma tell ya one time! Just relax and unwind 
Whisper sweet nothings, now you're blushin chills down your spine, 
Oh yeah you hot and tempted: oh, no, not Pretty Rickie 
But! When you _Grind on Me_ I'mma leave you hot and trippin 
Just slip in them. Satin sheets now go on and roll over 
Oh yeah it's up and down motions like a roller coaster. 
I see you up. On top you all on my Joc 
I'mma. Do it non-stop until yo' cherry pop 
I'mma keep goin and goin the Energizer Bunny 
Mister Long? John. All in your tummy 
 
This ain't, no lovey dovey, but watch how I seduce ya: 
Girl, I'm the man I-I-I'm, the man 
I push the right buttons and there's sex on demand. 
Oh yeah! I like it slow baby, be easy. 
Ooh watch your teeth. Baby be easy! 
Tell me yo', Vicky Secrets. Tell me all the dirt 
You smell, like peaches must be Bath.
