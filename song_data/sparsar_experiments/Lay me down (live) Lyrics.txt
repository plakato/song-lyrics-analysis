Lay me down (live) Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

I will write you letters that.
Explain the way I'm thinking now, I--.
I will return to you.
What I have taken long before, I--.
I will return again.
When it gets dark and day is done.

And lay me down.
In the hallowed ground.
Down by your side I will stay.
So lay me down.

And if you wanna stay with me.
Then let me know before it's light, I--.
I will recoil myself.
Into the black and darkest night.

And lay me down.
In the hallowed ground.
Where my father waits, I will stay.
So lay me down.

And lay me down.
In the hallowed ground.
Down by your side I will stay.
So lay me down.
