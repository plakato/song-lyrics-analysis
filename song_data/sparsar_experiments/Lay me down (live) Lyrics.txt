Lay me down (live) Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

I will write you letters that 
Explain the way I'm thinking now I -- 
I will return to you 
What. I have taken long before I -- 
I will return again. 
When it gets dark and day is done. 
 
And lay me down 
In the hallowed ground 
Down by your side. I will stay. 
So lay me down 
 
And. If you wan na stay with me 
Then. Let me know before it's light. I -- 
I will recoil myself 
Into the black and darkest night. 
 
And lay me down 
In the hallowed ground 
Where, my father waits. I will stay. 
So lay me down. 
 
And lay me down 
In the hallowed ground. 
Down by your side. I will stay. 
So lay me down
