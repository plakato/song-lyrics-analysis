Returning Home Lyrics
by Tyler Luke.


We are all disturbed, none of us are real.
No one causes happiness, no touch makes you feel.
Love is just a myth, sorrow is an urban legend.
The bible is fiction, who's the god that you mentioned?
Too many questions, not enough answers.
Too much too write, but not enough stansas.
The night time is just life, the moon sheds light.
But the moon is going away, it's time to say goodnight.

You gotta live, you gotta live your own life.
You have to look forward, it's harder to see in the night.
People who are near sighed are short flighted.
And the ones who are innovative are the ones who are enlightened.
Put down the bible, put down your camera lens.
Start using your mind, stop worrying about the past tense.
Stop burning books to prove your side.
Know your own morals, through your own eyes.
