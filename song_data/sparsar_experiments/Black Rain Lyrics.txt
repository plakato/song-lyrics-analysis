Black Rain Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Blue sky- the sun is shining bright.
Silence- the noises crystalsed.
Freezing when you feel the frantic form.
Breathe in the revenge for ancient sins.

Black- ancient poser.
Black- creeping hazard.
Black- out of darkness.
Black- black rain.

Falling rain washed away the light.
No excuse can justify the pain.

Black- ancient power.
Black- creeping hazard.
Black- out of darkness.
Black- black rain.
