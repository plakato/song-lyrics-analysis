All the ladies say, hoooo.
All the hoes say, Uh huh huh.
Haha.
A-Z.
I'm on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty.
Hold up, hold up, my nigga jus showed up.
Know what? roll up, get that L poured up.
Im on my grind shorty, don't block my shine shorty.
Wait a second, wait a minute.
My nigga just paid a visit.
I can't close a dutch no more cause I got too much reefer in it.
.
Boy stopp.
.
Man I ain't seen you in while.
Since we was a couple kids rebelious actin wild.
20 deep at the lunchtable.
Freestyling causing ruckus.
Ignorant mothafuckas.
P butter jelly lunches.
Ahhhhhh.
My nigga those were the days.
Nobody had no jobs and nobody had no babies.
The most important things were basketball and ladies.
The Friday night games and after that we were blazin.
Nostalgia hittin major, at the time nothin could faze us.
Couldn't stay in my ways.
So i guess i miss the days.
When we had more time to play.
You family to the end.
My nigga, here go the j like.
