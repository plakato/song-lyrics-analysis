DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE 3PAC Lyrics
by 3pac.


This one for all my fans, you know holding it down 
Not, giving a hoot 
Zero, hoots son 
Yeah, 
 
Damn. It feels good to be 3Pac. 
Never have to give no hoots 
All. The ladies love me because I'm so cute 
Everyday I be getting chedda because I'm the best 
Inspire the whole world in the end. What'S right, 
Cause we needed to see some change 
Maybe one day they will understand why I be doing all this 
But. For now they don't, but that's okay, because I'ma keep doing me 
The voice of a new generation. The youth is in my hands, 
Make the world a better place with this music that I make 
Damn. It feels good to be 3Pac, 
 
Damn. It feels good to be 3Pac. 
All of my dreams came true. 
Haters said I wouldn't make it now: they're really upset 
Cause, they see the white nigga, putting up numbers and they wan na, be like me 
But. They can't even touch me because I am god 
Some gettin' mad when they hear me saying nigga, even though they call me
nigga to my face. 
The real niggas, understand why I say nigga and they don't give a hoot 
Bringing, more change than Obama, yeah son. That'S the truth: 
I'm the beast in the booth son 
Damn. It feels good to be 3Pac.
