DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE 3PAC Lyrics
by 3pac.


This one for all my fans, you know, holding it down.
Not giving a hoot.
Zero hoots, son.
Yeah.

Damn it feels good to be 3Pac.
Never have to give no hoots.
All the ladies love me, because I'm so cute.
Everyday I be getting chedda, because I'm the best.
Inspire the whole world, in the end, what's right.
Cause we needed to see some change.
Maybe one day they will understand, why I be doing all this.
But for now they don't, but that's okay, because I'ma keep doing me.
The voice of a new generation, the youth is in my hands.
Make the world a better place with this music that I make.
Damn it feels good to be 3Pac.

Damn it feels good to be 3Pac.
All of my dreams came true.
Haters said I wouldn't make it, now they're really upset.
Cause they see the white nigga putting up numbers and they wanna be like me.
But they can't even touch me, because I am god.
Some gettin' mad when they hear me saying nigga, even though they call me.
nigga to my face.
The real niggas understand why I say nigga and they don't give a hoot.
Bringing more change than Obama, yeah son that's the truth.
I'm the beast in the booth, son.
Damn it feels good to be 3Pac.
