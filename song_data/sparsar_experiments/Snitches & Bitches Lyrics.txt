Jed 
Nigga: what's up 
What 
What's yo muthafuckin problem 
\- Better than sayin jack 
They, let me go 
Yo muthafucka. I don't wan na hear that weak shit, 
\- Nigga. What 
Fuck that I don't wan na hear that weak shit, 
You old rat-infested, goverment, informant cheese-eatin, ass son of a bitch 
You better? Have your vest on cause you'bout to come up short 
 
Caught a brother one day, gettin out of a cop car 
I know, there's more to come, but the few that have so far 
Talked to police about more than a court date 
They're victims of a certain Situation I'll illustrate 
Day-to-day pigeons poppin, all that junk 
About the dollars they makin a half a ki in the trunk 
Mobile phone in his lap and ten cars in the shop 
Sellin more than coke and side orders of hop 
But, there's a catch to that. The boy wasn't prepared 
He caught a case on a humbug. Now he's scared, 
No, more hangin, with the fellas drinkin gin and juice 
He's in a situation now where he can't be loose, 
Everybody wears jailies and sleeps on bunks 
And. It'S easy to tell the men from the punks 
So the ones who rhyme but run they mouths like bitches 
Wants, to hit the bullpen. They turn snitches 
 
, JED 
That's, why? I don't fuck with these old soft ass niggas 
Out here runnin round here, like they 187 artists, 
Killers, don't talk 
And these hoes supposed to be high roller ass, niggas 
Ain't that a bitch 
Everytime. I look around instead of stickin to the rules of the game. 
They. Let circus asses makin decisions for themselves: 
 Richie, Rich 
Yeah, it's hard times, Young JED 
But. It goes a little somethin like this 
 
The game is hard as wood, the macks don't splinter 
But yet and still trick-ass niggas wan na enter 
And with ballot in hand. They rush to vote 
To elect themselves into this game of dope 
But yo bro. The situation is real 
Don't slip in this game on a banana peel 
There's a lot of brothers runnin around pluckin collars 
Stuck up due to the fact they got dollars, 
Most of em punks gettin marked by young bitches 
Put in the county and the punks turn snitches 
Given, a alias now he's set free 
Or offered his job to be an f-e-d 
I, don't understand how a brother could turn 
His cheek on another homie when will ya learn 
The talkin to cops, makes it ten times worse. 

Why. Do brothers wan na hop in this game 
Runnin around they don't know the main frame 
And when they're caught they get to talkin like Polly 
But. They don't want a cracker, just bumpin, em, snitchin 
You know what I mean: 
Now, it's the high rollers and not the fiends 
Take off the Rolex and park all the cars 
You, just a punk yeah. You know who you are 
Why. Did you get in the game? If you wasn't equipped 
So what you're havin money and your car is whipped, 
Keep talkin to police, then you're gon na get 
Cause you'se a punk in a city of players, you'se a stupid muthafucka, 
 
, JED, 
Double, R.. 
What's. Up with these old broke bus, ticket-type ass bitches out here, huh 
Always tryin, to get with a nigga with some mail.. 
They need to get a muthafuckin j-o-b.. 
Quit blowin up these niggas' beepers 
Old stankin ass, muthafuckin bitches.., 
Here's somethin. I wan na tell all you hoes 
Fuck, you 
 
Man, these hoes in the Town, ain't shit, 
Can't fuck, with a nigga unless he's rich 
Sportin gold ones, man tryin, to make that mail, 
Hoe, mopin and hopin that you would treat her to nails 
Hoe. I can't treat nah nah it's'89 
Back in'87, when I was stuck to the grind: 
Money flowin like a river but hoe, I'm not trickin 
My, Zapco's, hittin, so hard, the light's clippin 
Girls on the bus, stop all of them coppin a plea 
To get with the man Who slings d, 
Whether, ridin a'Stang or a rag top Beamer 
The h-o's want to get with who's cleaner, 
So boys from the O? All of those who make riches 
What? Do we do Dog, bitches, 
Knockin and sockin is a everyday thing. 
The turfs and the side show is where the boys hang 
Hoe on jock for a brother with a fade 
Some zeniths, some vogues and the boy's got it made 
As. She makes the block with a baby in a stroller 
Her only destination to find a high roller. 
But hoe get real run and go get a job 
Cause. If I ever come to snatch ya, I be ridin a mob 
 
 woman 
Who is that 
 Richie Rich 
It's me come on.. 
, woman 
Ah-ah. I didn't recognize you in that shit.. 
Where, your Mustang 
 Richie, Rich 
Ain't, that about a bitch 
These hoes out here think niggas gon' taxi em around on gold ones, 
Nah-nah it's 1990 y'all hoes better to these muthafuckin old schools, 
Bitch jump in the bucket.. 
 woman, 
The door: don't open.. 
, JED, 
Double R fuck that hoe 
Tell her make like the muthafuckin Duke boys and crawl through the muthafuckin
window 
 
 fades:
