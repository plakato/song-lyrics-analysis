Get Up Off Me Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.


Bitch get up off me.

Bitch get up off me.
Trick get up off me.
Bitch get up off me.
Trick get up off me.
Bitch get up off me.
Trick get up off me.
Bitch get up off me.
Trick get up off me.
Bitch get up off me.
Bitch get up off me.
Bitch get up off me.
Pussy get from round me.
Bitch get up off me.
Bitch get up off me.
Bitch get up off me.
Pussy get from round me.

Wooh Da Kid.

Nigga get up off me, Bitch get up off me.
Sprinkle diamonds everywhere, everything frosty.
40 niggas, 40 guns.  40 Glock 40's.
Gave that boy a closed casket when they shot shorty.
Because we fucked one time that don't make you mine.
I guess she think that I'm her man cuz I was in her spine.
When you fucked my lil homies everything was fine.
Well you ain't the only one, baby fall in line.
If you ain't in my circle get from round me.
They call me Wooh Da King I think you should crown me.
You walk around and hold her hand but she wants me.
But when im finished im like BITCH GET UP OFF ME!

Bitch get up off me, Trick get up off me.
Yo girl see my ride I can keep this bitch from talking.
Stalking, talking, Bitch get up off me, trick get up off me.
Hoes won't let me sleep, ball so hard its exhausting.
Prick get up off me, trick get up off me, my top back on south beach.
My car cost half a million dollars mothafuckin car chief.
Im screamin Get Em Flocka! they like Gucci get em off me!
Pull up with the Buttercream guts painted coffee.
Haters lookin salty, Nigga get up off me.
Haters thought they had me but ain't no one to play me.
Boy play with ya daddy, stacks all in my khakis.

Dope Man Nikes man this rap shit is easy.
C4 leave ya leakin, he just another swag thief.
Label tried to clone me but ain't no way to clone me.
I robbed so many people that my family disowned me.
Move in with my homies then I move back on my lonely.
Swear my life a movie dawg I should win a Tony.
Oscar Or a Emmy, Cuz Gucci Mane a Movie.
No Wilt Chamberlain these bitches love my music. Its Gucci!
