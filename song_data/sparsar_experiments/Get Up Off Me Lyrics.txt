 Wooh Da Kid 
 
Nigga get up off me. Bitch, get up off me: 
Sprinkle diamonds, everywhere everything, frosty 
40 niggas, 40 guns., 40, Glock 40's 
Gave that boy a closed casket when they shot shorty 
Because. We fucked one time that don't make you mine, 
I! Guess she think that I'm her man cuz, I was in her spine 
When, you fucked my lil homies. Everything was fine 
Well, you ain't, the only one baby fall in line 
If you ain't in my circle, get from round me. 
They call me Wooh Da King. I think you should crown me: 
You, walk around and hold her hand, but she wants me 
But when im finished im like BITCH GET UP OFF ME. 
 
Bitch get up off me Trick. Get up off me. 
Yo girl see my ride. I can keep this bitch from talking. 
Stalking talking Bitch get up off me trick, get up off me, 
Hoes! Won'T! Let me sleep ball so hard. Its exhausting 
Prick get up off me trick. Get up off me, my top back on south beach, 
My car cost. Half a million dollars mothafuckin car chief 
Im screamin Get Em Flocka. They like Gucci, get em off me. 
Pull up with the Buttercream guts painted coffee, 
Haters, lookin, salty Nigga, get up off me. 
Haters thought they had me, but ain't. No one to play me 
Boy play with ya daddy stacks. All in my khakis 
 
Dope Man, Nikes man. This rap shit is easy. 
C4 leave ya leakin. He just another swag thief: 
Label tried to clone me, but ain't no way to clone me. 
I robbed. So many people that my family disowned me 
Move in with my homies, then I move back on my lonely. 
Swear my life, a movie dawg. I should win a Tony 
Oscar Or a Emmy Cuz Gucci Mane, a Movie 
No Wilt Chamberlain. These bitches love my music., Its Gucci
