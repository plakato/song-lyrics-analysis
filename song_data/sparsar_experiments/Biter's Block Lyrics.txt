Biter's Block Lyrics
by Rugged Intellect.


This is the biters block 
A place where amateur rappers 
Can start to mimic their favorites to get a slice of props 
In'86. These cats would probably die 
But everybody wan na bite since 50, trying to be Ja, 
, 
I'm, sick of haters. My flow is colder than refrigerators 
Half. These kids are brainless and famous for being imitators. 
They say that Big's, the greatest
