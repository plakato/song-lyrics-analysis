Chicks
by Tyler Farr.


Map dots, parking lots.
Honky-tonks, fields, and back roads.
They come alive on Friday nights.
Don't shut down 'til that rooster crows.

Chours.
It's just some rural route rockin'.
I don't ever see it stopping.
Got them good old boys hoppin' oh yeah.
And they're spending every dollar.
Make 'em hoop, and make 'em holler, woo hoo.
It's how we do it up in here.
Chicks, trucks, and beer.

Tan lines, straight pipes.
Longneck bottles iced down.
That's all you need.
That's the recipe to do it up big in a little town.

Chours.
It's just some rural route rockin'.
I don't ever see it stopping.
Got them good old boys hoppin' oh yeah.
And they're spending every dollar.
Make 'em hoop, and make 'em holler, woo hoo.
It's how we do it up in here.
Chicks, trucks, and beer.

Colt ford, tell 'em how we roll.
Short skirts, chrome, and dirt.
Long legs, pony kegs.
Loving on a tailgate.
Friday night, I can't wait.

Chicks, trucks, and beer.

If you get the chicks, then you got the trucks.
And you got beer, then you got others.
You can't have fear son, if you want speed.
Now where we come from this is all we need.
Them chicks, trucks, and beer.
It's how we do around here every night.
Chicks , trucks and beer.
We keep it country, but we keep it real tight.
Chicks, trucks, and beer.
That's all we know.
Chicks, trucks, and beer.
Come on, Farr, let's take it down the dirt road.

Ice cold beer, come on.

They done let country come to town, y'all.

Or maybe town came to country.
