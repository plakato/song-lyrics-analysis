Give In Lyrics
by 4hero.


You used to wake me with a smile on your face.
Each morning lieing next to you.
Now we don't talk cause you have nothing to say.
So sad.
Wish I could help see you through. Well....

Wish time could stand still so you don't feel left behind.
You never thought you'd find.
Yards of broken.
Torn apart.
I know they're be times of rain those are the days that I want to give in.
I'll be your friend through the cloudy days.
Don't be ashamed I won't let you give in.

Sometimes I wish you could say all the things you want me to be.
But every day that that you cry.
Is a day that goes by.
And you're slipping away from me.

Wish time could stand still so you don't feel left behind.
You never thought you'd find you're so broken.
Torn apart.
I know they're be times of rain those are the days that I want to give in.
I'll be your friend through the cloudy days.
Don't be ashamed I won't let you give in.

Hey love I've been meaning to call you.
It seem the stress of life put cracks in your armor.
But you do it because it has to be done.
Although the faster you run your destination gets farther.
I wish i take away you problems with a drop.
Of a dime and say its all good but its not.
Your dreams get undermined accounts get overdrawn.
No matter the case girl I'm waiting with open arms.

I know they're be times of rain those are the days that i want to give in.
I'll be your friend through the cloudy days.
Don't be ashamed.
I won't let you give in..
