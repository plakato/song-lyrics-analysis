Knicks Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

Why don't you come over.
Make some dinner.
We can mute the Knicks game.
And put on a record.
Head over to Mobil.
Pick out a sixer.
Pretend you don't miss her.
Not anymore.

How was your weekend?
Did you get a cool boyfriend?
You didn't.
But I bet you will soon.

Why don't you come over.
Same time tomorrow.
And every day after.
Until you feel better.
