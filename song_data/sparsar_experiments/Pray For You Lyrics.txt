Pray For You Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Well I've been where you've been my friend.
I felt the rain fall sideways.
Hell on wheels in the fast lane.
Down the crooked highway.
And I've been through that perfect storm.
My heart was wrecked, my soul was torn.
And I know, I know, I know.
And I know, I know, I know.

Sometimes you need more than whiskey.
Sometimes wisdom just won't do.
Well I ain't gonna judge you.
I'm just gonna love you.
Tonight I'm gonna pray for you.

Your mamma's cried, your daddy's tried.
Your friends have all but left you.
You had an angel in your arms.
But you let her go, I bet you.
I tried my best to numb the hurt.
Sometimes you can't find peace on earth.
And I know, I know, I know.
Well I know, I know, I know.

Sometimes you need more than whiskey.
Sometimes wisdom just won't do.
Well I ain't gonna judge you.
I'm just gonna love you.
Tonight I'm gonna pray for you.

And I know, I know, I know.
Somebody pray for me.
And I know, I know, I'll know.
That heaven's listening.
And I know, I know, I know.
That you don't know my name.
But I know, I know, I know.
I know, I know, I know.

Sometimes you need more than whiskey.
Sometimes wisdom just won't do.
Well I ain't gonna judge you.
I'm just gonna love you.
Tonight I'm gonna pray for you.
Tonight I'm gonna pray for you.

Oohhhh yeah ohh.
I'm gonna pray.
I'm gonna pray.
I'm gonna pray.
I'm gonna pray for you.
Pray for you.
