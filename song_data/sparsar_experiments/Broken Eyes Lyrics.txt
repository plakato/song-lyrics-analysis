Broken Eyes Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Hey there girl with the broken eyes, ain't my love been true.
Ain't no need to act surprised when it comes back to you.
When it comes back to you.

The wind blows high and the wind blows low, as long as I have known.
Everything that blows away, soon is gonna come back home.
Soon is gonna come back home.

Standing there in your raven hair, acting like you don't know.
Lips that launched a thousand ships, that's where my money goes.
Where my money goes.

I know they say I'll rue the day, I gave you a peice of my heart.
It's do re mi, and dust to dust, things all fall apart.
Things all fall apart.

Hey there girl with the broken eyes, ain't my love been true.
Ain't no need to act surprised when it comes back to you.
When it comes back to you.

The wind blows high and the wind blows low, as long as I have known.
Everything that blows away, soon is gonna come back home.
Soon is gonna come back home.
Soon is gonna come back home.
Soon is gonna come back home.
