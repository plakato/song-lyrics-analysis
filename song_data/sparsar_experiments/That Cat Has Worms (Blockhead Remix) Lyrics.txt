That Cat Has Worms (Blockhead Remix) Lyrics
by The Uncluded.

Aesop Rock.
Woke up to a note on the door.
It said I love you but I can't do this anymore.
Ha, I was just about to say that.

Kimya Dawson.
I was so excited to eat my beans.
Lifted the spoon they were fuzzy and green.
Jackpot.

Aesop Rock.
Ordered two over-easy with hash and toast.
She brought two dozen blinis and half a goat.
Uh, not what I ordered but I'll take it.

Kimya Dawson.
Went to sleep but it was a short snooze.
Woke up screaming boobs boobs boobs.
And I don't know why.

Aesop Rock &amp; Kimya Dawson.
Here's where it goes from bad to worse:.
I heard meow meow meow that cat has worms.
That cat has worms.

Aesop Rock.
Calling all ages: school is a creep show.
Mostly a place to consume the placebo.
Yum yum yum, that's good placebo.

Kimya Dawson.
Left for an hour, went to Zumba.
My dog got eaten by the Roomba.
That totally sucked.

Aesop Rock.
Food truck say hello to mouth truck.
Beans go up and teeth go down up.
Down up.

Kimya Dawson.
Tried to make a porn with Magilla Gorilla.
He wrapped us both in a corn tortilla.
We'll try again next week.
