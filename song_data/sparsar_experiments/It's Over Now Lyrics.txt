It's Over Now Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.

I want some Brand Nubian.
Pac and Rakim.
Biggie, Nas.
Really don't make emcees like they used to.
Freestyle Fellowship.
D.O.C, Pharaoh Monch.
Jay, Ahmad, and Thought from the Roots crew.
That's a hood who's who.
Now what you dudes do.
Make a wack album.
Pay Lil Jon do two.

But you weak.
We know he got heat, what you do?
Sick of hype.
Homie is you tight or boo boo.
I'm precise with mine dun diced a few fools.
Got stripes for serving on mics you new to.
From the Life where if you ain't nice we boo you.
Boo hoo go head cry if you wanna.
What you got's not hot they rock mine every corner.
Homie can't see me if he try he a goner.
Plus he must be smoking that Thai marijuana.

It's over now.
I told y'all it's over now.
We off in them Range Rovers now.
It won't stop but it's over now.
It's Over Now.
I told y'all it's over now.
We got money to fold up now.
It don't stop but it's over now.

Ahmad's going through a carpenter phase.
Carving up stages.
And mics with tight rhymes sharper than razors.
Fools talk so often I'm made to.
Defeat these MC's in 3's.
Like Stojakovic, Peja.
See whatever you got and I'll raise ya.
Man who you kidding.
Poppin' your lip then hit me back when I page ya.
With it whenever whatever.
I'm too clever you'll never.
Do nothing to my crew ever.
We heavyweights to you feathers.
Paragraphs to letters.
We the Jag's you Jetta's.
You backspins we more advanced like Capoeira.
Avenue band stands apart where fans set us.
Y'all loose.
We tighter than Bruce Bruce's sweaters.
Rocked with top sellers.
So hot they got jealous.
Haters pop a lot we not gon' stop fellas.
Every rhyme's divine we shine cause' God let us.
Grindin' till we platinum lying in Barbados.
