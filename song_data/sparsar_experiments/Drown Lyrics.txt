Drown Lyrics
by Tyler Joseph.

Here I come, come to you in the very clothes.
That I killed, killed you in and now I know I'm alone.
I walk to you, rain falls from you.
Can you wash me, can you drown me.
?

I wanna be a lot of things, so much pent up inside of me.
I wanna be stronger, too long I've sat here undecidedly.
Planning strategy, half of me know it's all just a fallacy.
Failing miserably, drastically and then I crash dramatically.
Into a wall I've hit a hundred times before.
And yet I still ignore the dark red blood stains on the floor.
And I'm back in front of you, Lord, with the blood on the floor.
Is the blood mine or yours? Don't wanna do this anymore.

Back and forth between me and me and who you call me to be.
You see a man free who thinks he has to buy a key.
To a door but he can't ‘cause he's.
poor and he can't.
Fall down anymore ‘cause he's already on the floor.
And his heart is broken and all and this is his scar.
But it's warm from crying ‘cause he.
will try nine times.
To realize nine crimes but he has more than nine lives.
So he picks himself up and keeps fighting for the prize again.

Here I come again to you.
Just to show the blood soaked through.
Through my bones and all I own.
Is there a way for me to grow?
I walk to you, rain falls from you.
Can you wash me, can you drown me, please?

Every time I feel selfish ambition is taking my vision.
My crime is my sentence, repentance is taking commission.
It's taking a toll on my soul, I'm screaming submission and.
I don't know if I am dying or living.
‘Cause I will save a face for name's sake.
Abuse grace, take a aim to obtain a new name in a newer place.
But my name is lame, I can't walk and I ain't the same.
And my name became a new destiny to the grave and.
They say the ocean's blue but it's black right now.
In the dark, on the sand, looking out at my crowd.
Depression and drowning singing.
now the full parts.
Of lightning reveals where the ocean stops and the sky starts.
I've been told by the sky that the ocean I shall win.
But it's hard for me to see where ocean stops, and where sky begins.
A random strike of light reminds me of what is true.
But right now the ocean is black and black the sky is too.
