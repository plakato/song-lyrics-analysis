L.O.N.E.R Lyrics
by Xavery Williams.


I, like my space, 
In outerspace 
Should, I slow it down. 
Can you keep with my pace. 
 
I have no friends 
And, I'm not sorry, 
I'm, a L, O N E R 
And. That'S the story. 
 
I'm good, with girls, 
I'm cool with dudes 
I, try 
But. I can't stand these fucking rules, 
\ -- 

I'm, not a weirdo, but I'm a little different 
I'm like an ancient dragon mixed with kitten, 
My spirits big., My dick is bigger. 
I hope I got your ears. The picture's getting bigger, 
 
This world is real, but it's about to change. 
Tell me what you feel inside your brain, 
The, answer's there-, it's inside your blood 
You can't cheat on this test-. I bet you thought you could 
 
Is it weird. I, like peace and silence, 
Is it weird. I prefer. I love over violence. 
I'M me and me is only person I can be 
Not like I'd choose to be another cuz. I love me 
\ -- 

I, like my space, 
In, outerspace 
Should, I slow it down. 
Can. You keep with my pace: 
 
I have no friends 
And, I'm not sorry, 
I'm, a L, O N E R 
And. That'S the story. 
 
I'm good, with girls, 
I'm cool with dudes 
I, try 
But! I can't stand these fucking rules. 
\ -- 

Let me explain. I'M tired of the same 
Games played by dudes trying to get brain 
If. I want that ass, then Ima get it 
You sit lie and talk before you hit it. 
 
These girls are shallow the ones I see 
See as and see. I don't mess with thee. 
If you got some money or a known name. 
Values set in later so rely on fame, 
 
It's, not all, but it's a lot of some 
I, don't hate its just my species being dumb 
So. It'S all good party on nigga 

\, -- 

I. Like my space, 
In, outerspace 
Should, I slow it down. 
Can you keep with my pace. 
 
I have no friends 
And, I'm not sorry, 
I'm, a L, O N E R 
And. That'S the story. 
 
I'm good with girls, 
I'm cool with dudes 
I, try 
But. I can't stand these fucking rules, 
\ -- 

I, like my life, I truly do. 
I'Ve met some cool people who keep it true, 
And some don't, but that's there thing 
Karma always come back like the season spring 
 
I like most and that's the truth, 
But, I'm so appalled by some of these social rules. 
I'M, not the dopest, sometimes I'm so uncouthe 
But. When im blazed, my swag breaks the fucking roof 
 
I like to party I like to chill 
But. I can party good with poppin pills 
But. If I get lucky, I hope she popped the pill. 
I shouldn't have enticed her by tossing bills
