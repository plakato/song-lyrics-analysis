Oooooooooo Lyrics
by The Uncluded.

Aesop Rock.
By the comb in his beard, he's weird when he's lonely, I'm lonely and weird.

Party in the backside over the ear in the wake of a sobering year.
Faces of death on the regular, tricks of an apex predator.
Escape from a tray of developer.
Uncle a couple days off the sauce and all black as a basic corpse.
A cold turkey dressed like a steak with forks the brand new.
Vick pick from an ancient war.
he went.
Hither and yon brown liquor like a scissor in his palm that would cut away.
his kid and her mom.
Best laid plans go off and arrive but I still use knots that he taught me to tie.
Never met an angel, never knew a ghost.
Though I swear on the cast I.
can hear a little voice going.

Oooooooooo.
Oooooooooo.

Kimya Dawson.

Fish in my ear, spider on Nancy.
Saying Aunt Nancy is with grandma dancing.
No more tubes, little miss fancy.
Toe head, toe shoes, far from the 'mancy.
Roses are red, violator peek-a-boo.
Half cracked door, head bald, see through.
Cracked head attic light escape routes.
Double dutch baby, smoke a sweet tooth.
Trying a deal, smacked by the dealer.
Light skin thinner, easy to peel her.
Open to kill her from the inside out.
Same silly girl with the twisted mouth.
No more pain bottle bagged tracheotomies.
Sweet prickle head strong trying to tickle me.
Topic of cancer, project get gone.
She says 'sing me a song'.
I say.

Oooooooooo.
Oooooooooo.
