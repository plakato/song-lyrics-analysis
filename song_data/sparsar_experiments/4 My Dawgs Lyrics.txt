4 My Dawgs Lyrics
by Tyga.


Cry little sister.
Thou shall not fall.
Come, come to your brother.
Thou shall not fly.

This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy.
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy.
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Fuck you, pay me, fuck you, pay me.
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Goin' crazy, fuck you, pay me.
This for my dawgs out here.

Now you wanna be friends.
You the type to fuck a nigga for his pension.
All a nigga ever wanted was a 6 Benz.
And if you a bad bitch, come get the dick again.
They be like... oh wait.
Step up in the spot and they screamin' oh aye.
Which one of y'all wanna chill? OJ.
We sippin' Moet champagne.
On me, all the bitches on me.

Cry little sister.
Thou shall not fall.
Come, come to your brother.
Thou shall not fly.

This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy.
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy.
This for my dawgs out here goin' brazy.
Goin' crazy, fuck you, pay me.
You ain't alone out here, I'm goin' crazy.
I'm right there with you.
We right here with you.

I met some models, they said life full of obstacles.
Challenges and mobster rules and Libyan size pools.
Hold my breath and take 2, anxieties and robberies.
Survival, threats, apologies, I made it through the poverty.
I be... on my own shit.
Cause you never, never know when somebody gon' trip.
Oh shit, miss a nigga with that bullshit, man.
Aye bossman, I'm my own bossman, understand?

Cry little sister.
Thou shall not fall.
Come, come to your brother.
Thou shall not fly.

This for my dawgs out here goin' cray-cray.
Goin' cray-cray, got that AK.
Point it at your bay-bay, we goin' crazy.
We goin' crazy, fuck you, pay me.
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
We goin' crazy, fuck you, pay me.
For my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Goin' crazy, yeah.

T-Y-G-A, we goin' crazy.
Young, Young, Young Mula baby.
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy.
Fuck you, pay me, fuck you, pay me.

This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy.
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy.
Goin' crazy, they goin' crazy.

Cry little sister.
Thou shall not fall.
Come, come to your brother.
Thou shall not fly.

Unchain me, sister.
Thou shall not steal.
Love is with your brother.
Thou shall not kill.
