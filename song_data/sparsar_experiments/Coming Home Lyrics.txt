Coming Home Lyrics
by SWV.

Don't be afraid, baby.
Don't be afraid, baby.

Love is just like a storm.
No sunshine at all.
To guide you my way.
Oh, boy, you know that I care for you.
Don't be afraid, my love is here to stay.
Oh, yeah. You don't have to be scared of me.

I'm coming home to you.
Dont be afraid, baby.

I have to go away now.
I'll always be here with you.
Oh, you're a special boy, here in my heart.
Our love is strong, and I won't keep you waiting for love.

I'm coming home to you.
Dont be afraid, baby.
I'm coming home to you.
Dont be afraid, baby.
I'm coming home to you.
Dont be afraid, baby.
I'm coming home to you.
Dont be afraid, baby.

Come here, boy.
How many times do I have to tell you, I'm never gonna leave.
Home is where my heart belongs.
Because home is where you are.
Your love is so good to me, words can't express.

I can't wait, gonna make love to you. Oh, yeah!
All night, all night long.
All night, all night long.
All night, all night long.

I'm coming home to you.
Dont be afraid, baby.
