Make It Pop Lyrics
by XO-IQ.


Bright lights, late nights, ow out on tour.
Screaming fans hanging at the stage door.
Everyone who's anyone is wearing my line.
Front seats, fashion week, for my designs.
Woo hoo.
One day, woo hoo, someday.
We'll be taking over, Look over your shoulder.
We're gonna bring it hard to you.

I can't wait no.
I can't wait no.
I can't wait no.
I can't wait.

So make it pop we're bout we're bout to blow.
Wait til we drop oh yeah we're ready to go.
Ain't gonna stop when is it time for the show.
We make it, you make make it, we make it ...
Ma ma ma ma ma make it pop.

Sky high.
Like a cloud.
Turn it up.
And then play it loud.
We're on stage and we'll light em up.
They all know they can't get enough.

When I step on they're gonna feel my flow.
From the very front seat to the very last row.
Crazy style, we're way too cool.
We won't stop cause that's how we do.
Woo hoo.
One day, woo hoo, someday.
We'll be taking over, Look over your shoulder.
We're gonna bring it hard to you.

I can't wait, no.
I can't wait, no.
I can't wait, no.
I can't wait.

So make it pop we're bout we're bout to blow.
Wait til we drop oh yeah we're ready to go.
Ain't gonna stop when is it time for the show.
We make it, you make make it, we make it ...
Ma ma ma ma ma make it pop.

We're bout we're bout to blow.
Wait til we drop oh yeah we're ready to go.
Ain't gonna stop when is it time for the show.

We got the fire, and we got the game.
We got the fire, and you'll know our name.
