Dry Your Eyes Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man.
Girl there's something that's telling me.
That you're in need of company.
And you need it now.
So I'm willing to comfort you.
For all, all the pain that you're going through.
So baby don't....

3rd Storee.
1- Girl don't cry, dry your eyes.
You don't have to be alone.
I'll be there for you.
Girl don't cry, dry your eyes.
If there's anything that you need.
Come get it from me.

Lil'Man.
And everyday that passes by, darling I cry.
For every tear that draws from your eye.
So baby don't, baby don't.
Don't you worry cause I'll be here.
Don't fear my dear.
I'll wash away your every tear.
Oh baby, baby girl don't cry.

D-Smoove.
Girl call me if you ever feeling down.
I said call me if you need a real man I'm â€˜round.
If you ever in need of a man with sensitivity call me.
Baby it's driving me crazy to see you cry.
Girl dry your eyes crying another minute took a chance.
To put you by for a one night stand.
Of romance, my love's a hand see.
With me is where you outta be girl can't you see.
I wanna get with you, gotta get with you.
Feeling to be with you.
Can you feel me, yeah feel me baby.

Jay-R.
Well I'll be there for ya baby.

I'm always here for ya baby.

Don't have to fear nothing baby.

Take away your tears little lady.

Well I'll be there for ya baby.

I'm always here for ya baby.

Don't have to fear nothing baby.

Take away your tears little lady.
