2nd Delivery Lyrics
by Sway UK.


DCYPHA!
It's my second delivery.

This ain't camera.
This ain't vado.
This is that rapper named sway, dasafo.
King of Picasso UK's Movado.
Because I'm breaking bread with Jamaicans: hardough.
Black African they call me donny darko.
But in this mad world I'm fair: half bro.
I love money I take it from anybody.
And I'm never sorry when I leave an ex like heart broke.
See the horns, I've got them saying bravo.
Welcome to the delivery two, this is my parcel.
And I'm a Shepherd my staff is working hard.
So the only lambs that I'll be rolling with'll be gollado's.
Or phantoms, of the oprah.
Because I'm tryna make that money like harpo.
I got that tax free, dirty money in my hand see.
Got the whole team saying ah gross!
They got my back like barcodes.
Set up president even though most of us can't vote.
Because they got cases that can't close.
So much money involved bro you can't fold.
There's so many whips behind us.
I don't know if this is a slave ship or car show.
I talk a lot of shit.
I'm an asshole.
Anyway, Kunta Kinte, the O.G.
I told you mudasukas that my name's not tobi.
Put me back on my boat please, I wana see Kofi.
Annan, one hand up on the beach.
like oh see.
Chilling in the shades, and I ain't talkin Oakley.
Sway's, always been the sun ray that they don't see.
Prince Charles of the rap game, where? oh, me?
Britain's number one rapper everybody owes me.
So pay up, or don't sleep.
Better stay up, I'm coming to your home g.
Playing with my money's like playing with my emotions.
So I'mma start Robinsons smokey.
Here is sway again.
That's what the haters sayin.
From two thousand and eleven.
I got it covered like Arabians.
They better run for cover.
Cause I'm coming for the game again.
And they won't see my face.
Like the cover of casabian.
Left me in the rain and now this brothers got his flame again.
I'm ready to aim, I'm back in the gym ready to train again.
Careering it all rocky but I'm blamin it on Adrian.
My age is tweny eight so I got no space to be playin.
Seeking the space to flow he's outa this world I fink he's alien.
Ready to face off with anybody face to face wid em.
The animal has just escaped from nicolas's cage again.
Your crew are from the apes, well I'm ready to raider theme.
And I ain't stopping at the white flag like a Canadian.
Red I'm gonna be paintin them without a new leaf.
I'm ready to draw the blood of anyone using my name in vain again.
And I will go insane if they don't let me in the game.
I'll go into the palladuium with pockets full of uranium ready to explain.
again!
