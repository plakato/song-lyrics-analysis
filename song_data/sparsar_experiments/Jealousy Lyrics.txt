Jealousy Lyrics
by Ty.

Mia missin' in action, 
Brother get away. 
I can prove the lazer bein' running in my back 
Piercin' penetratin' 
How. Do I react to jealousy 
My best friend's telling other people my biz 
People. I don't like tryin' to find where ever I live 
People. I grew up with 
Turning. Their backs. Make no money, though 
And. If I did you'll, be the first person to smile 
And. If I did I'll be the first one 
And, when you do, you can pose on my skateboard 
Cause, I'm not tryin', to move with no snake forth 
One of the main reasons I'm checking for you 
Is. You could spread rumours just to brake up the crew 
And as you tryin' to understand what my mind is about. 
The only thing you get from me is hi hello and I'm out 
Cause of a 
 
J j e e, a a l, l o o you you s, yyyy 
Can, you feel it Can you feel it 
, 
Ty, 
A, good friend, just graduated from? U 
I should be happy for running through me. 
I'M green-eyed, whatching green 
Women exit 
I recognize her face from back. In my youth 
When, we used to be a little bit uncool, to say at least 
Always on the huzzle have to had you to pay the fee. 
Now he's looking cooler 
Now me and him used to have 
We chose to handle it like men, and I came out. 
You know how the 
See 
Into fully blown hatered 
So. I waited until he passed me by 
Then. I pulled out my house keys rolled up on his BM 
Stressed, a whole line in the side. 
And singed, my name too 
, 
Ty 
Mama, never told me. It would be like this 
Stiff upper lips thruth face tight wrists, 
With anger and 
Watching others chillin' on levels that we wan na, be on 
It's. A common accurrence respected by 
Would, be a liar if I wasn't affected by 
Hate fever and the shape of a meat cleaver 
Tripping through the nerve ends like a 
The girlfriends 
Jealous of who I talk to women. 
Constant arguments always leave my head. Spinning 
I thought we sorted this out in the beginning: 
When she her ex-man, I'm not grinning 
I'm telling you 
I've been frightened in this feeling, since the influence 
It takes over in a instant 
It's like a great cloud about to bloom 
And, I don't understand, walk 
 
Whyy 
Whyy
