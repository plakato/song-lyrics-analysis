Alien Lyrics
by Unknown.

Lani.

By Larry Kaplan.

1\. Blue skies, white clouds, fish jumpin' in your hand.
What a day to be fishin' ole Nantucket sound.
From the island up to the mainland.

Get me my fiddle we'll sing all old songs.
You take the high notes, and I'll take the low.
Good times and hard times, there all worth the telling.
It don't matter to me that you sing 'em that well.

2\. I remember the days when you worked for a living.
Pulling hard just to get back to shore.
And you busted your back and you didn't get dinner.
We don't talk much of that anymore.
3\. Stayed up with the old folks, fell asleep to their stories.
Played a tune to the hollerin' wind.
Sang a song while the children were put away warm.
And the night tides came rollin' back in.

4\. Worn out, smellin' of bait.
Come home when the wind blows you home.
And the sun over west chalk, the warm summer breezes.
Make you think that things never will change.
