Banstyle Sappys Curry Lyrics
by Underworld.

If they dont know and they dont know theyre gonna find out soon enough.
Im so hot. as.
If that hurt. did you wash it. fester it around some. you dont even have to.
Mind your own stuff. bring in the marines. ive.
Heard so many other things and it was all brown. with the suction ones.
The ones that suck it up. and i dont ever do the eye till i did that.
Thing. i bet you like a blue boost. try a noose. loosen the strap where.
The two metal ends. rest your head against the steel. blow in to the tube.
Show me your legs. help me. show.
Me a pink smile. walking up the aisle. show me the things underneath.
Your seat. show me your tiny plastic soft drink. a song like a.
Squealing pig. like a train with wheels. in the dark with the lights.
Off. concealed. im thinking of you still. :: white room. little legend.
Fishman. nike man.
Red stripe. blue mercedes. big dog. salty man. full moon rising. old.
Boy. salty girl. bunny girl. happy shopper. bouncing.
Ball. city sun. think i found the real stuff. i think i found the real.
Stuff. white crumbs across your bed. gray clouds cover bethnal green.
White jeans. black top. nice shape. cracks a blue bitch till the son come.
Sliding. naked beneath the knee. reflect black eyes. your knee talking. i.
Think i found the real stuff. i think i found the real stuff.
