Lost in ways Lyrics
by Vision.

I don't want- 2x.

I don't want, to let you.

We live everyday, always feeling lost in ways.
I don't want to stand still 2x.
3x.

I don't want-.
I don't want to stand still.

I don't want-.
To stand still.

I want to scream but, I have nothing to say.
I've been walking in this dream standing still in the light of day.

I don't want-.
To stand still.
3x.

I don't want- 7x.
