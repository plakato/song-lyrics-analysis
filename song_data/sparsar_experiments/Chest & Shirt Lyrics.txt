Chest & Shirt Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

I'll find a way to reincarnate you.
I'll carry you in my womb.
All the way home from work.
When the power went out.
And the streets were filled.
We bought our water and drank our milk.
It made our bodies work.

Matter will not matter and printed words will stop.
And I'll keep your empty wallet in bearing weighted dirt.
In metal silly lockets between my chest and my shirt.

Don't try so hard to be yourself.
This will be the last song I'd ever want you to hear.
I've got the ears in my belly.
They hear you sing and they talk to me.
I learn their language.
