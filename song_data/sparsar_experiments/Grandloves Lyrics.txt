Grandloves Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


Take, all the little things away
Seek all the dimensions that stray
From my eyes
Dig holes in me with wooden carved trowels
Hold. Still in me, the hops
That left it's guard. Down

Waking up is easy, but you're breaking my whole thesis
I'm gon' feel it but you're flowing with the shaman and another thing
I'm in love with truth and sick and tired of this youth
And thinking that you're falling but you're stalling when you're holding me

I'll grow bitters on the borders Of your whistling skin
I'll sew pockets of the locks that fall from your bristling chin
Keep, all my secrets in the trinkets
Dangling from the walls
Take. What you are make it make it sacramental

I'm in love with truth and sick and tired of this youth
I want it to be easy. But I'm queasy at the thought of it
I: don't need no proof, no lucky charm, no wisdom, tooth
To know it in the same way of that feeling. When you're loving me ... 

Brew you a warm drink out. Of
My tattered hulls
Build you thick paper out of
My, clumsy skull
Silent, discreet, make
Your, bouldering, shoulders, glow
My grand loves
I'll, not finish what I done: started

Megan James and Young Magic
I'm sick of this. You sick of that I'm not as dumb as that

Megan James
I'll stake. Rare toothpicks in my dirt filled heart
Meander. The sacred lot of you
In every season

Young Magic
See that visual you are invincible
You, hold it for your halo, song
