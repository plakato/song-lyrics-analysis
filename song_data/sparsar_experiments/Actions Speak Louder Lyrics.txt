Actions Speak Louder Lyrics
by Swoope.


We are your hands.
We are your feet.
It's time for us to stand, yeah.
Cause we love you Sudan.

Swoope.
If I'm honest I'm tired, hungry, I'm frustrated, all of the above/.
A little sore from civil war when all I seen was blood/.
I shed tears, heartbroken, all I need is love/.
Im Drowning fast in my sorrow, all of me is flood/.
I've seen hurt, seen death, seen slaughter. Now I need some clean water, all I.
see is mud/.
It's like nobody out there cares cause all I see is shrugs/.
It's like nobody out there hears cause all their ears is plugged/.
).
Man I'm feeling like a lion whose hungry and weak/.
So it's the mighty God of Zion who humbly I seek/.
I stumble and weep/ with the tears running from cheeks/.
Each moment I wonder if he will ever so subtly speak/.
And I'm confident He will so I'm confidently still/.
Deliver me from sickness Lord conquer what is ill/.
I still stand, and when I'm rescued is His choice/.
I stand still and know my refuge is His voice//.

We are your hands.
We are your feet.
It's time for us to stand, yeah.
Cause we love you Sudan.
Actions speak louder, louder than words.
Put our prayers in motion, let's bring heaven on earth.
Let's bring heaven on earth.

God, today another home somebody owned is now a puddle/why the rain came I.
wonder while they wander through the rubble/.
Why me, why now, should they think why not/.
Is everything against me to take everything I got/.
Someone got out the bed this morning some got of the floor/some went off to.
work this morning some went off to war/.
Some ate half a plate and trashed it just to get some more/but trust me.
that's not an option in places like Darfur/.
Vision blurry as the skies cries like my eyes/.
In despair I cast my cares as I cry to the sky/.
I never hope in man, though some are willing they're unable/.
But I'm the kind who'll be fine with crumbs from the Master's table/.
I know this situation hasn't caught you by surprise/.
In fact it's with faith I choose to walk instead of sight/.
I know that you love ‘em, since the womb you knew them/.
You never forget/so may the grace that drew ‘em, renew ‘em/.

I don't have the words to articulate.
The way you let me drown in your never ending grace.
How my crimes are covered and washed away in blood.
There is nothing in me conditioning you to make you love.
I can't attract, impress or try to win your heart.
But you give it all and you been involve.
And your never change even when I'm wrong.
Your love still goes on to make an atonement.
Love infinite and unconditional.
Nothing can separate us cause now I live in you.
There is no amount that can calculate your divine love.
Its so much that Christ was given to die for us.
Its stronger than death, deeper than the ocean.
Bigger than the night sky the earth could never hold it.
And its not impulsive, its holy and pure.
Its not a weakness or soft its sharp as a sword.

Sample: John Piper.
God in eternity looked upon me.
Forseeing my faultness, my pride, my sin and said.
I want that man in my family. I will pay for him to be in my family with my.
Son's life..
That's love, folks. That is mega, off-the-charts love …
