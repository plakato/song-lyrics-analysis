Red Cross (Brick Cover) Lyrics
by Zu.

Winner Circle.
Look Book.

Auckland ZU.

It's Young Killem and get back to merkin.
It's Young Iller than them that I'm versin.
Perfect.
My flow is nice, remind me of surfin.
Kelly Slater I stay on, cos them sharks is lurkin.
I Josiah the beat, I leave rappers in hearses.
Now who dare to compete?

Young Ill but don't call a surgeon.
I'm 17 the illest boy emerging, perfect.
Winner Circle in the building I came with them man them.
Nothing further from the top is all the we demanding.
I want a white MayBach like I'm breaking commandments.
I've got a dream of reachin further than anyone landed.
And to Hire Michael Hill to make me a pendant.
And to get a white girl who look close to perfect.

I'm not talking Skinny Jeans, I'm outta dey circuit.
