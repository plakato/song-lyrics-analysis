Hey. All I wanted was a bankroll. 
I had jugga for a bankroll 
All hundreds bankroll 
Dirty money, bankroll 
All I wanted was a bankroll

Counting money till the bank. Close 
I was working in the same clothes 
Now. We slumin', like the bang, bro's 
I, might pull up on your main hoe niqqa. You know how the game go. 
All of my niqqas on a pay roll 
Feeling like hoes and chingo Hitta wan na try me dej loaf, 
 
Hey. All I wanted was a bankroll. 
I had jugga for a bankroll all hundreds bankroll dirty money. Bankroll 
All i wanted was a bankroll bankroll. Bankroll
 
All. Hundreds bankroll dirty money, Bankroll 
 
All, my mingos stacking pesos, doing numbers like the gay code. 
How you ballin'. When you stay broke, stripper loyal, niqqa, cage, close 
Y'all know I can see the money even when my eyes close 
Me and Rex slumin' hit'em with that blindfold. She ain't even my hoe, and

Hey. All I wanted was a bankroll. I had jugga for a bankroll 
All hundreds bankroll dirty money. Bankroll 
All i wanted was a bankroll

Aye bankroll. I just want a bankroll. I just want a bankroll bankroll. Bankroll
