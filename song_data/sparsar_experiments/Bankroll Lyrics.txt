Bankroll Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Hey, bankroll, bankroll, yeah.
).

Hey, all I wanted was a bankroll.
I had jugga for a bankroll.
All hundreds, bankroll.
Dirty money, bankroll.
All I wanted was a bankroll.
Bankroll, bankroll.
All hundreds bankroll.
Dirty money, bankroll.

Counting money till the bank close.
I was working in the same clothes.
Now we slumin' like the bang bro's.
I might pull up on your main hoe niqqa you know how the game go.
All of my niqqas on a pay roll.
Feeling like hoes and chingo Hitta wanna try me dej loaf.

Hey, all I wanted was a bankroll.
I had jugga for a bankroll  all hundreds bankroll  dirty money bankroll.
All i wanted was a bankroll  bankroll bankroll.

All hundreds bankroll  dirty money Bankroll.

All my mingos stacking pesos doing numbers like the gay code.
How you ballin' when you stay broke  stripper loyal niqqa cage close.
Y'all know I can see the money even when my eyes close.
Me and Rex slumin' hit'em with that blindfold she ain't even my hoe  and.
fuck the 5'0.

Hey, all I wanted was a bankroll, I had jugga for a bankroll.
All hundreds bankroll  dirty money bankroll.
All i wanted was a bankroll.
Bankroll bankroll  all hundreds bankroll  dirty.
money Bankroll.

Bankroll, bankroll bankroll, bankroll bankroll.
Aye bankroll, I just want a bankroll I just want a bankroll, bankroll bankroll.
