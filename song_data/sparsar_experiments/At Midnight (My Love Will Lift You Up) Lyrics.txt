At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up) Lyrics
by Rufus.

You said you won't.
I bet my neck, I bet you will.
I'm gonna check my love.
You I'm gonna thrill.
Can't imagine what you've missed.
Can't go on.
Meet me at midnight in the light that starts the love.

Since there's was you.
I changed my mind about it all.
Instead of goin' on.

I'm gonna settle for a fall.
My love, my love will lift you up, up, up.

You came into my life and now I realize.
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight.

Since there's was you.
I changed my mind about it all.
Instead of goin' on.

You came into my life and now I realize.
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight.
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight.
