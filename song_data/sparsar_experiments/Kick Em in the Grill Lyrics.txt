Kick Em in the Grill Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

Serch Aiyyo Pete, it's Chubbs.
Chubb Sup G?
Serch Yo Pete.
Nice Yo Serch.
Serch You know people tryin to gel us right?
Try to gel.
Chubb Yeah dat.
Serch So you know we gotta we gotta rip this.
Chubb Serch let's go kick that shit G.
Drop it right here.
Serch Right here, like an asshole.
Chubb One two.
Serch One two, ya don't stop.

MC Serch.
Grooves get kicked as Serch tries to flip like coins.
Pain, like the foot to groins.
3 Strikes but I didn't gel the head yet.
Why you still vexed over things I haven't even said yet.
Yo Pete, put you part-time like temps.
Scale like a fence, put you in the past tense.
You tried speedin but you ain't fast enough to chase me.
So what I did this, ?? bring the kit to Ben Casey.
And don't waste time.
Dopest tracks, so why you gonna waste rhymes?
I absorb like a sponge in the bozack.
I'm trifle, get the rifle, or I step back and crack slugs.
And my crew give pounds and hugs.
Tugs on my shirt, let me know that I'm still pro-fessional.
And at the end of the session, you'll know.
That the 3rd'll disturb the verb with the noun.
Shift the sound, so GET UP AND GET DOWN, Serch'll never stand still.
Try to flam I'll be like Claude Van Damme and just kick em in the grill.

{Kick em in the grill..} {3rd Bass}.
{Kick em in the grill..} {I'm Chubb Rock}.
{Kick em in the grill..} {Serch!}.
{Kick em in the grill.. grill.. grill Pete!}.

Pete Nice.
?? like a camel to ??
Missin the points of ?? spliffs.
If you wanna gamble, let it flow.
I ain't Al Jolson and Sambo.
Low like a buddhist sniffin ? tree.
But that booty fat bass it ain't movin me.
To be or not to be on, your FM.
Step to the AM, the gimmicks, I'll play em.
I say em while I'm takin 40 swigs.
A Chinaman eats with two twigs.
Called your numbed, 9-7-0 PISS.
Goodfella, you can tell you're on my hitlist.
For this I stick like a splinter.
Play ya like a sphincter cause my title's Minister.
Serch said kick em, I gas em and trick em.
Rhymes like ??, now Chubb, stick em.

Chubb Rock.
Jump jump with the man with the plan, Chubb Rock.
You know, a judo, a chop chop chop.
From stereo monarch rationalize the grammar.
It's like that and ah.. and ih.. ih.. if I stammer.
Or sa-st-stutter, english found in the gutter.
Or the sewer, while I talk like Pete Puma.
How many lumps do you want inside your coffee?
Isn't about time, isn't about time, you stepped off me?
Yo Chubb - are you the best, are you the one.
That ?? large chest, well, nevertheless my.
Finger won't do the walkin through cleavage.
I got a girl of my own, she's at home.
Chubb is not conceited, I'm convinced of the fact.
Vanilla sold seven million copies of some shit that was wack.
He can wrap, his lips around a big black cock.
He needs no more pressed, let me stop.
Cherry crusaders, clean clairvoyany concepts.
Claiming critical conversations that came in..to view.
Of 3rd Bass mixed with Chubb Rock until.
We kick the motherfucker in his, umm.
G-R-I-L-L-L, word up that's the grill.

MC Serch.
Chill!
Hold up, Chubbs, you got lifted.
{Word up} What's the science?
