Evergreener Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.

Earthly keeper wise in the wonder
Are, your ring now forest deeper
Evergreener
No one follows, as you wander: down

Death bestows the leaves
Underneath, those trees

Folded golden shores, where you were born
Fading further colors you adore
Folded golden shores where you were born
So much older, bolder and more

While in winter summer's. Lovers
You. Remember as you're walking
Evergreener
No one follows as you wander down

Violets turn to snow
But you already know

Folded golden shores, where you were born
Fading further colors you adore
Folded golden shores where you were born
So much older, bolder and more.
