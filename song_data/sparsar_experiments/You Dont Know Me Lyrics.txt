You Dont Know Me Lyrics
by Andrew E..

Ever since 1991, hanggang ngayon I stayed humble  .
Pero pag-inapi ako, get ready to rumble  .
I'm minding my own biz - wala na sa showbiz  .
Forget comedy - coz hindi ko na matiis  .
May mga ilan na nagmamaang-maangan  .
They say I'm nobody at sila'y nagtatawanan  .
Get off my back - you f*****g disease  .
Mga trying hard Pinoys to my displease  .
What's my name? A-N-D-R-E-W E  .
Nine platinum records, ahay yah that's me  .
At ikaw, meron ka wala oh wala pala  .
Kaya know me first at 'wag kang tatanga-tanga  .
At don't tell me Who the f**k is he?  .
22 blockbuster movies  .
Excuse me, magtatanong ka pa kung bakit  .
I'm more popular than you think so f**k it  .
  .
Andrew E. say what?  .
You don't know me  .
My name on newspaper and on tv  .
Mas lalu akong inaapi mas mayabang I become  .
Here I come, here I come, here I come, come, come  .
You say I'm panget pero bakit ka nagagalet  .
Pag kinuha ko girlfriend mo, you will say Oh shet  .
Oh shet talaga kaya ilayo mo na  .
Baka pag natikman ako, sa 'kin s'ya sumama  .
Coz I'm hot like pizza, I taste like pasta  .
Vermicelli, Tagliatelli, Putanesca  .
Putrages ka kung balikbayan, don't try  .
I'll screw your girl in front of your own two eyes  .
And she'll be back to you and tell you I love you  .
But she ain't gonna tell you what she did to Andrew  .
But you never make puna  .
Dine-date mo nilawayan ko na  .
Excuse me, magtatanong ka pa kung bakit  .
I'm more popular than you think, so f**k it  .
  .
Andrew E. say what?  .
You don't know me  .
My name on newspaper and on tv  .
You can DJ, talk s**t, you brag and boast  .
You can rap rap rap but you can't come close  .
So here's a toast sa mga bobong tulad mo  .
Hip-hop, hip.
