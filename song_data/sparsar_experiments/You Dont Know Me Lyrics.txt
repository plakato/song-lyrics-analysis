You Dont Know Me Lyrics
by Andrew E..

Ever since 1991 hanggang ngayon, I stayed humble 
Pero pag-inapi ako get ready to rumble 
I'm minding my own biz wala na sa showbiz 
Forget comedy coz hindi, ko na matiis 
May, mga ilan na nagmamaang-maangan 
They, say I'm nobody at sila'y, nagtatawanan 
Get off my back. You f*****g disease 
Mga, trying hard Pinoys to my displease 
What's, my name: A-N-D-R-E-W E 
Nine platinum records, ahay yah. That'S me: 
At ikaw, meron, ka wala, oh wala, pala 
Kaya, know me. First at'wag kang tatanga-tanga, 
At. Don'T tell me Who the f**k is he 
22 blockbuster movies? 
Excuse me magtatanong ka pa kung bakit 
I'm more popular than you think so, f**k it 
 
Andrew. E. say what 
You don't know me 
My name on newspaper and on tv 
Mas, lalu, akong, inaapi, mas mayabang. I become 
Here. I come here I come here. I come. Come come 
You say I'm panget pero bakit ka nagagalet, 
Pag kinuha ko girlfriend mo you will say: Oh shet, 
Oh shet talaga kaya ilayo mo na 
Baka pag natikman ako sa'kin s'ya sumama 
Coz, I'm hot, like pizza, I taste like pasta, 
Vermicelli, Tagliatelli, Putanesca, 
Putrages, ka kung, Balikbayan, don't try 
I'll screw your girl in front of your own two eyes. 
And she'll be back to you and tell you. I love you 
But. She ain't gon na tell you what she did to Andrew 
But. You never make puna 
Dine-date mo nilawayan ko na 
Excuse. Me magtatanong ka pa, kung bakit 
I'm more popular than you think so, f**k it 
 
Andrew. E. say what 
You don't know me. 
My name on newspaper and on tv 
You can DJ talk s**t you brag and boast. 
You can rap rap rap, but you can't come close 
So. Here'S a toast sa mga bobong tulad mo 
Hip-hop hip
