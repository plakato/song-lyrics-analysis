Autotonsorialist Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

Chris.
Most often the house is empty.
And as if i were about to touch another for the first time again, my hands.
shake as I think.
The buzz is light tickling the air like my hair tickles my spine as it.
trickles down, water flows.
Would you help steady my hand, help make my coastlines less jagged?
I think my name is safest in your mouth.

Dave.
How could you drown us out?
Our wrong blood.
How could we give in?
Our wrong blood is in your history.
How could you drown us out?
Our wrong blood is in your history.
How could we give in?
Our wrong blood.
How could you drown us out?
How could you drown us out?
Our wrong blood.
How could we give in?
How could you drown us out?
Our wrong blood is in your history.
How could we give in?
Our wrong blood is in your history.
How could we give in?
Our wrong blood.
How could you drown us out?
How could you drown us out?
Our wrong blood.
How could we give in?
How could you drown us out?
Our wrong blood is in your history.
How could we give in?
Our wrong blood is in your history.
How could you drown us out?
Our wrong blood.
How could you drown us out?
