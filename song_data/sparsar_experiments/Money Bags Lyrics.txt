Money Bags Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


All I want is money.
All I want is money.
All I want is money.
All I want is money.

Money, money, money, all I want is money.
Busting down them onions, turn them into hundreds.
Whipping up the blow, that's a bag of money.
Junkies at the door, 'nother bag of money.
Money, money, money, all I want is money.
Wake up in the morning thumbing through them hundreds.
Go finesse a ho, that's a bag of money.
Hundred bands a show, 'nother bag of money.

Bitch I'm back in the trap with the sack and the strap.
I got money on my mind, that's a salary cap.
I just happen to rap, I got the crack, got the pain pills.
And if you looking for that gas, bitch I'm Hank Hill.
I keep a fox in a dress like Wanda.
You haters cut it out like Angela Anaconda.
I'm swimming with piranhas, got some niggas like to gang bang.
And I be getting off kis like I can't sing.
Just try to maintain, man I would never.
Thugga follow that bread like Hansel and Gretel.
Got these hoes' heads gone like Hannibal Lecter.
You can talk to the hand bitch - Hamburger Helper.
Doing better and better but they ain't quite like me.
The way I'm balling, they about to make a Like Mike 3.
Shit I might not speak, I just show that ho the check and.
The whole crew pass her ‘round like the book in Best Man.

Guala told ‘em he's back and their feelings got hurt.
Still screaming Free Crack like I'm giving out work.
Bad bitches, I murk, yeah you know I'm player made.
Girl if money make you cum, bet this dick will make you stay.
Nigga hustle day to day, spend my nights up in the ass club.
Foreign hoes in my bath tub, my dogs balling like Air Bud.
Got a bad slut, knew that I would one day smash her.
Now we bare on the covers like Kanye Albums.
I got 8 plasmas, Rolexes, rings.
And a fly pad – Kotex with wings.
You got low self esteem, talking like you're handicapped.
I say what I want like I'm sitting on Santa's lap.
Feet on the ground, hold it down like a bobby pin.
Money talks and y'all niggas is Joseline.
So many clones, every day I got a B-Day.
But stabbing your friend in the back is the only way you can be Trey.

They treat me like Gerald since I got my lil' vert.
I just sent that ho a tweet, now oops! There goes her shirt.
More profits than the church, feds asking if I got the scale.
You know my dog speaking Spanish like Taco Bell.
I'm chasing mail, chasing tail, what you call that?
Dr. Dolittle, when that pussy talk, I talk back.
Like I read books, bring that paper back or hard back.
More P's than the lunch lady on All That.
Fuck Clifford, we big dogs, got steels like Chris Paul.
Flow cooler than menthols, blow paper like spit balls.
Big balls like Wipeout, slang wood and strike out.
And I don't know where Howard stay but I'm in da white house.
Dick all in your wife's mouth, nigga I be spazzing.
Keep a latin bitch and I ain't talking Princess Jasmine.
Fill her up with passion, leave when she take a nap.
Pass her to my dog like table scraps - All I want is.
