Never Always Lyrics
by Viva Fidel.

Never Surrender! Always Remember!

Have you ever wanted to say what you were really thinking?
Put the pen to the pad , or go straight off the dome!
Get you some release therapy, a moment of clarity.
When I recite- it's silent, psychologically violent.
Let me tell you bout this life I lead - A mastermind.
Past the concept of time, rhyming shit amazing.
Archived and ageless, scribbeled out on pages.
The days of my life shared with out fear for the world to hear.
The word is the weapon, the message is clear.
Execute ya mission, step up ya bigger vision!
This is called upliftment, its time to take you higher.
I help you get through the fire! Got something to inspire.
The ones I love even the few that hate.
This just a test of faith.
Keep ya head on straight, don't never turn ya back!
It's going down, just like that.

Never Surrender , Always Remember!

Staying on that war zone mentality reality is art.
And this is frontline love.
Reinforcement for our forces.
Somebody gotta step up up and become a voice for the voiceless.
Teach our youth about back before the poison.
So they can balance out their choices.
And see the trap before they step in it.
By now we already know how you go out and get it.
Don't get offended , see greed make the smartest muthaf*ka get stupid.
Now rap is like a hustle they don't even honor the music.
Don't be scare to stand strong put yo thinking cap on.
And tilt that.....
Here hit this.....
Don't even trip....
Don't event trip....
Never Surrender Always Remember.

Yes.
Because right now, through the truthful revelations that we have to deal with.
and face in our own homes, where our own hearts' at.
And right within our own families , in our own communities.
We gotta step up and step out and fix.
Some of these situations.

In other words, our conversations need some elevation.
You understand what I'm saying?
It's for real..It might be normal to some ya know, and It might be strange and.
unheard of to others....
But can you identify your enemy? I mean really?
What was you sent here for?
Everything happens for a reason, what did you happen for?
You gotta ask yaself.....
All across the Planet Rock, we show love.
It's a survival instinct, we barely get a chance to bllnk out here.
Spittin' these lines, standing up being a spine.
And being a strength representing generations of intelligence!
Like that.
