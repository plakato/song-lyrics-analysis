I Love Highschool Lyrics
by Yung F.L.Y.


This goes out to anybody in high school and anybody that remembers them high.
school years.

That party last night was awfully crazy, but now its Monday.
Now back to class and teachers asking for my homework.
We both know that shit ain't done.
I just come to school for fun.
Cut up in class.
Taking bad to the teachers 'till I get suspended.
I love high school.
Being bad.
Acting like an ass.
So the teacher make me stay late after class.

I wanna go to school till I'm wrinkle and old.
No not really but that sounds kinda cool.
Getting up at 6, time to.
get a shower.
The bus comes soon only got about an hour.
A whole lot of homework.
and lots of detentions.
Teachers on my case and oh.
did I mention?
Cuttin' up in class I don't give a damn, see.
Most of the teachers in my school can't stand me.
Take another test, teachers give it back.
I'm praying to myself just hoping that I pass.
I got the test back, they gave me a D.
I raised my hand like teacher why you hatin' on me.
He turns back around and starts up a fuss.
I ain't gonna take it so I started to cuss.
I tell him that he's mad he ain't makin' no profit.
He wrote me up a slip and sent me to the office.
Take this.

So I'm sitting in detention contemplating in my mind.
Things that I could do to help me pass away the time.
I throw a paper ball at the back of the teachers head.
He was filled with anger then he turned and said, too me.
Did you throw that mister dean?
I'm just laughing like yeah that's me.
So he walks to the phone, calls the principal.
Then he turns and says, whose laughing now?
The principal comes into the room.
He walks up to me and hands me a broom.
He says he tells me I should go sweep the halls.
I tell him man you should go suck my balls.
Hah!
He proceeds to call my mom.
She picks up the phone like now whats wrong?
Then he says your son's being an asshole.
She replies to the man like that's all?
