Enemy Lyrics
by XOV.


In an open fire.
I don't understand.
What happened here?
Thought we were friends.
No, I won't deny it, I fell so deep.
But you ran away, so far from me.

Now that things have changed, you wanna know me.
But you don't know me, you know the old me.
Don't come up to me and talk as if we're homies.
Cause we ain't homies.
Nah, you don't know me.

I remember every word, every word you said.
I remember everything, everything you did.
I don't wanna be your friend or your enemy.
I remember every word, every word you said.
I remember everything, everything you did.
I don't wanna be your friend or your enemy.

Brother, I don't buy it.
What you want from me?
Just stay away.
No apology.

Now that things have changed, you wanna know me.
But you don't know me, you know the old me.
Don't come up to me and talk as if we're homies.
Cause we ain't homies.
Nah, you don't know me.

I remember every word, every word you said.
I remember everything, everything you did.
I don't wanna be your friend or your enemy.
I remember every word, every word you said.
I remember everything, everything you did.
I don't wanna be your friend or your enemy.
