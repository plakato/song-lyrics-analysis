21 Lyrics
by Que (FreeMind).


If we getting high.
We down to ride.
We on the rise.
We living life.
We pray that we living right.
But if not, we'll pay the price.
We all going to some day.
So while we still got life we might as well live it our way.

Hopefully when we pay the price.
For being reckless and living life.
Doing.
Any to have a good time.
We don't pay it with our lives.
Cause in our minds, Why even try.
When the battle is never won.
So we live fast and we die young.
Only pray that we reach 21.

Riding with them boys and girls and we're high.
All we want to do is have a good time.
Young wild and reckless is how we live life.

Pray that we make it to twenty one.
Whoooaa, whooaaa.

We make it to twenty one.
Whooo-oa-oa-oh, oa-oa-oh.

Riding with them boys and girls and we're high.
All we want to do is have a good time.
Young wild and reckless is how we live life.

Pray that we make it to twenty one.
Whoooaa, whooaaa.

We make it to twenty one.
Whooo-oa-oa-oh, oa-oa-oh.

I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils. There's a more.
important topic I'd like to discuss.
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era. Young men that learned to.
do everything spiteful.

This is your generation. Live fast and die young. Who's willing to explain.
this story?

Riding with them boys and girls and we're high.
All we want to do is have a good time.
Young wild and reckless is how we live life.

Pray that we make it to twenty one.
Whoooaa, whooaaa.

We make it to twenty one.
Whooo-oa-oa-oh, oa-oa-oh.

Riding with them boys and girls and we're high.
All we want to do is have a good time.
Young wild and reckless is how we live life.

Pray that we make it to twenty one.

Live for today, F tomorow.
Just roll the weed up and open bottles.
No liscence, but we still drivin'.
Point O, 8, but we still ridin'.

Born in conditions where just living, have you feeling pain and sorrow.
They say that we all got a chance to make it, but we know they lying.

Cause, some dude, got to sit at the drive-through.
While you order your fast food, either way somebody gone loss.
I ain't saying that we can't make it.
I'm just saying that most won't.
The rich getting richer. poor getting poorer.
Can't tell that ain't wrong.

Born into ignorant religion, basterd.
children, money anyway you get it.

And those who do get the chance to drink legally usually in prison.
So we don't even try, we just getting high, we living life.
Drink our liguor as we pray to god.
Vanity slaves living for tonight, we jus.

Call her up.
Call him up.
Thet already, know what's up.
Tell them to, bring the so we can, roll it up.
Light it, Take a puff.
Just can't, get enough.
Blowing strong, PowerPuff.
Pull up hop in the truck.
