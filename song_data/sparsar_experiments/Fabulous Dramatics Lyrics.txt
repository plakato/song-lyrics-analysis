Fabulous Dramatics Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.

She used to call me baby.
Then she stopped calling me at all.
This girl was kind of shady.

He pumped her up to get the drawz.
Now she want me back I'm like naw.

Went mine you go your way.
Don't stalk and be at my doorway.
Like Troy you don't get no play.
Don't call me I don't want no date.
I got a wife Genuine like Sole'.
Talk about me I don't care so hate.
You just want my dough you're so fake.
Do whatever you want just go away.
Cause....

I got too much on my mind.
You take too much of my time.
Call and you aggravate me.
Fed up I had it baby.

I shouldn't be thinking bout' you.

My ex never listens.
She's so dramatic when she calls.
Got my baby's mama trippin'.
When I'm in traffic dippin'.
Or if she see me at the mall.
I act like she ain't there at all.

Those theatrics you do.
I don't buy when you cry boo hoo.
Baby I'ma do me you do you.
Don't wanna get back, get that, we're through.
If you sad the store got tissues.
But I ain't finna deal with your issues.
You ain't winning this time so just lose.
You're really making me sick as the flu.
And....

Lil' mama understand.
You can't just call my man.
Get you another plan.

I'm tired of thinking bout' you.

Don't show up at our home.
Stay off my telephone.
Just want to be left alone.

I shouldn't be thinking bout' you.

You better cut it out.
Stop crying shut your mouth.
Give it up let it go.
He don't want you no mo'.
You need to get a life.
Got it wrong, get it right.
Go on, leave us alone.
Can't let you come and ruin our happy home.
