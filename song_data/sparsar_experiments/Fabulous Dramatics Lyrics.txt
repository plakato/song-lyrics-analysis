Fabulous Dramatics Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.

She used to call me baby 
Then. She stopped calling me at all. 
This girl was kind of shady 

He pumped her up to get the drawz 
Now. She want me back, I'm like naw, 
, 
Went mine. You go your way, 
Don't stalk and be at my doorway. 
Like, Troy, you don't get no play. 
Don'T call me, I don't want no date. 
I got a wife Genuine like Sole' 
Talk about me. I don't care so hate 
You just want my dough you're, so fake 
Do, whatever you want, just go away. 
Cause ... 
 
I got too much on my mind. 
You take too much of my time. 
Call and you aggravate me 
Fed up. I had it baby 
 
I shouldn't be thinking. Bout' you 
 
My ex, never listens 
She's so dramatic when she calls 
Got my baby's mama trippin' 
When, I'm in traffic dippin' 
Or. If she see me at the mall 
I act like she ain't there at all, 
 
Those theatrics, you do 
I don't buy. When you cry boo, hoo 
Baby I'ma, do me you do you 
Don't wan na get back, get that we're through 
If you sad, the store got tissues 
But. I ain't finna deal with your issues. 
You ain't winning this time, so just lose 
You're, really making me sick. As the flu 
And ..., 
, 
Lil' mama, understand, 
You can't just call my man 
Get you another plan, 
 
I'm, tired of thinking bout' you 
, 
Don't, show up at our home 
Stay off my telephone 
Just want to be left alone. 
 
I shouldn't be thinking bout'. You 
 
You, better cut it out. 
Stop crying shut, your mouth 
Give it up. Let it go 
He, don't want you! No mo' 
You need to get a life 
Got it wrong. Get it right. 
Go on leave us alone, 
Can't! Let you come and ruin our happy. Home
