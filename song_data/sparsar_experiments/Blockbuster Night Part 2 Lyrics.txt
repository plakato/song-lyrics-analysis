Blockbuster Night Part 2 Lyrics
by Run the Jewels.


The elephant's in the room, I'm talking two ton.
Bitter truth to ya' face, like this is two gun.
One half of the crew, you know them jewel runners.
Move us out of our lane, shit who's gonna?
Shit stain on they brain, that's right- poo'd on ‘em.
And pissed on ‘em! Dirt kicked on ‘em!
Shot his cat, pop that pussy, threw that bitch!
Stood behind his mama, put my dick on her!
Killer did a Killa Cam- couldn't kill a kid so I spit on her!  Like.
this on her!

I somersault in the room and then pop to the van damme split on em.
Rappers all get the dick like they got clits on em.
Big and sweaty testicular cancer induced tits on em.
The love to hug and cry and explain what they are the victim of.
Braid each others hair and tell stories bout how they've been in love.
Hey kids I'm a computer, I'm a trooper feeling super, shoot the future like a looper.

You tryna step like gooses ima go home with your luger.
The tie-ers of the nooses get a broom up in their pooper.

This is for the dope do-er, ho pursuer.
If you procure then you cut her and stick her like a skewer.
See this is for paupers and the prisoner, authors of the literature.
Opposers to the holders of the swastika insignia.

Cue the music I'm bout to do something stupid.
I got a new shiny tool kit to fix your face and I'll use it.
Flippin birds I ain't talkin no middle fingers.
Come line up to kiss the ring of your favorite rap singer.
Des pot roast comin out the oven hot.
Stuntin on you bumbaclots fronting like you runnin blocks.
Bet your mother love to watch you come up out ya fuckin socks.
Spin the barrel take a shot loves you or it loves you not.
Pop..schlepping weapons out the seven.
Betting on who gettin to heaven first with the henchmen.
Try to test me I'll send some shots at your keppy.
You best address me correctly but mama still calls me Lechky.

When someone ask me to spit it, I'm nasty.
Like a cabbie with cricket, I know it like the back of my hand.
I actually did it If you even think ‘bout dapping my hand.
Homie better be dapper than Dan, You wit it.
Actually fam, what you wanna gonna laugh at me fam?
Right cause I'm tacky and tan.
It's actually him pass me the gin.
Pass me whatever you got, pass me your bitch.
Pass me the clip hit it hold it now it's bout time to pass me the 5th Sipit.

Soledmysoulforitpass it back to the bitch.
Hopefully she get half as just swizzed as wik.
After the fact that he had to just sip, just dip.
