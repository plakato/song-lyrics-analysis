Can I Get an Amen (feat. Martha Wash) [Revolucian Remix] Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Given all you could, to the relationship.
Like a fool done job, 9 to 5 you gotta work it, work it.
But the best of you, has yet to arrive.
All the love inside is all the love you ever needed, needed.

All the dreams you had, all the things you've wanted.
Don't turn your back, it's not too late.
You better love yourself before you love somebody.
Love somebody, love somebody.

Can I get an amen.
Can I get an amen.
If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen.
Can I get an amen.
If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
A-amen.

Say hello goodbye, maybe another try.

Til you realize, your love is alive.
All the love inside is all the love you ever needed, needed.

All the dreams you had, all the things you've wanted.
Don't turn your back, it's not too late.
You better love yourself before you love somebody.
Love somebody, love somebody.

There's a fork in the road.
Which way will you go?
You standing still or will you step into the great unknown?
It's yours to decide.
This is your life.
This is your life.
