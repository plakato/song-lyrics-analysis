Glock Luv Lyrics
by Black Kray.

Repping crip gang, blunts fat like Gucci  .
She want a thug to ride on 26s  .
.
And on the flip phone so young nigga ain't textin  .
Gold slugs in my mouth looking like hoes  .
Glock love x20.
I'm in the south with KayKay, yeah he posted  .
I'm on my chirp phone, I'm posted like a young hoe  .
I'm with my cousins and you know they got them Glocks out  .
I be coolin, my blood buz he be boolin  .
Bust your Glock   .
  .
Velour blunts, cause a young nigga be stressin  .
Triple 7, posted up in heaven  .
Glock love   .
I'm a young nigga, I don't fuck with sixes  .
  .
.
I got a goth hoe and she straight out of Maxis  .
