Secret Garden Lyrics
by Sway Clarke II.


Hey girlfriendâ€¦I know you asked a question.
Like are you the only rose in my garden?
And I know this sounds contemptuous.
And I'm sure it will affect us.
But no, no, no.
Please just beg my pardon, see.

I got white ones, purple ones, red ones.
Baby I got love to give, baby I got love to give.
I got black ones, yellow ones, brown ones.
Baby I got love to give, baby I got love to give.

Hey best friend, I know you got some questions.
Like when I start to grow my secret garden.
Didn't happen on a weekend, but over different seasons.
Toronto had me cold.
I was young with no control.

My heart was looking for.
White ones, purple ones, red ones.
Baby I got love to give, baby I got love to give.
I got black ones, yellow ones, brown ones.
Baby I got love to give, baby I got love to give.

Momma always told me to guard my heart.
Everything that smell good ain't meant to be in your garden.
Run wild and be free put the boys on your to do list.
The only thing they wanna do is get between your tulips.
Take you out of your element.
Hold onto your innocence.
When they come they'll pick you up and have a handful in their other hand.
Oh baby girl just give it to them and you'll see it.
If anything when that flower blooms, is dirt still underneath it.
I got my daisy dukes on when you hit me like a stone.
Wasn't sure if you was good with all that poison in your heart.
Whatchoo doing with that girl down south.
He bought me roses on our first night out.

I never knew that love came in so many different colors.
He was sweet.
He was calm.
He was nothing like my mom said.
What kind you got for me, he turned around and told me.
