Bad Character Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Madlib.
Yeah.
Check me out.
Check me out.
Public enemy number one.
Lord Quas up on the set.
Word Bet.
Bad character you see up on the screen.

Sample.
Unjust, sinful, vicious, oohhh.

Guess who's the new bad character in town?
Causin' mischief in your city, turn that shit around.
I'll smack a nigga with a brick, talkin' outta place.
Like I was sniffin' paint laced, flyin up outta space.
LORD QUAS, I'll put your best through a metamorphis.
Have ya' slavin' in my dungeon while I'm eatin swordfish.
So BITCH WAIT, we watchin pornos with Romes.
We analyze for the astro-black shit.
Madlib got the grass to get so we get lit.
We commence to astro-travellin'.
Grabbin up skins, so we can play a game of javellin.

I'm labelled as a bad character.
No matter what I do I'm labelled as a bad character.
I'm labelled as a bad character.
No matter what I do I'm labelled as a bad character.
I'm labelled as a bad character, bad character.

I'm always lookin' under some girl's dress.
With a vest, cause some ducks wanna put me to rest.
Now I'm a soldier in the town drinkin' Butterfly Snapple.
I walk around the streets passin' out poisoned apples..
Now it's time to skip town..
Hey yo, you dirty niggas know how I get down!
I'll stab a nigga in the chest with a pitchfork from behind.
And rob some rich folk for makin' my ancestors eat swine.
Y'all niggas commin' slower than guns while I'm on the run, the director.
I'm labelled as a bad character.

Yo, I'm labelled as a bad character.
No matter what I do I'm labelled as a bad character.

Sample.
HAHAHAHA!!! I warned you folks! HA!
I warned you sista'! Yeeeeesssssss.
I'm the new bad char-ac-ter.
