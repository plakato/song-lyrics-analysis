Time is up Lyrics
by Quietude.

Time is up, 
Time is up, 
Time is up, 
Time is up 
 
KayNine 

Yeah they glowing and my flow is always flowing. 
Slow down, nigga, stop overdosing 
I'll cut your tongue. So don't stick your nose in 
Bitch, it's called''calling'', not that''Phoning'', 
I'll, kill, Wolf. Hayley drag him into fire, then smoke the shit out of him 
How, you want it. You, gay, nigga, 
And I'll, put Nicki into a pink casket. 
Reflection got a mirror on my necklace. 
You can't touch me. I'M Steven Seagal 
Fuck court for me killing's just legal 
I. Don'T have time for ya, go find a toilet seat. 
I can stop time. Am I a stop? Watch 
Time is up what it sound like 
It's Succession Red gang now thats sounds right.
