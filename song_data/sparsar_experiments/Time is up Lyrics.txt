Time is up Lyrics
by Quietude.

Time is up.
Time is up.
Time is up.
Time is up.

KayNine.

Yeah, they glowing and my flow is always flowing.
Slow down nigga, stop overdosing.
I'll cut your tongue, so don't stick your nose in.
Bitch, it's called ''calling'', not that ''Phoning''.
I'll kill Wolf Hayley, drag him into fire then smoke the shit out of him.
How you want it? You gay nigga.
And I'll put Nicki into a pink casket.
Reflection, got a mirror on my necklace.
You can't touch me, I'm Steven Seagal.
Fuck court, for me killing's just legal.
I don't have time for ya, go find a toilet seat.
I can stop time, am I a stop watch?
Time is up, what it sound like?
It's Succession, Red gang, now thats sounds right.
