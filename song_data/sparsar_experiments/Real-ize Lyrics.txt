Real-ize Lyrics
by UNIFIED GIANTS.

“Real-ize” by Unified Giants.

Laaa, La La La La La La Laaaaa Laaa.

World Wide.
World Wide.

I seen the world with my 3rd eye.
In the crib posted up wearing headphones, then I leak the pen.
For the sake of the song.
And where the wrongs become right, just looking in the rearview.
I've been sitting to long I smell the mildew.
But imam shake it off and let the world know, that I can take a loss.
I'm scouting the routes and then I move in and then I way cost.
I cut the blocks, where precision is crucial.
Like smpte, I process the music.
Just bumping the newest.
I get to moving on to moving, And by then, you got movement.
And no doubt.
I'm one of the best to ever do it.
And saying that, is just a humble brag.
Some people write rhymes… I write math.

Real Eyes.
Realize.
Real Lies… that you tell.
You understand right?
You understand that!

Real Eyes.
Realize.
Real Lies… that you tell.
You understand right?
You understand that!

You know me I keep it positive.
Unless your talking bout HIV positive.
And that's a negative; I'm out for leverage.
Not trying to live off of hamburger lettuces.
I'm grinding every day, so why I'm stressing it.
I wrote messages homie I'm the messenger.
Pharaoh bloodline rap song developer.
I'm steady telling ya'll that the worlds ours.
And so calleds want to label us a worldstar.
And left to die if we ever see a world war.
And that's a cold game, and if I tell the truth.
Id sound brand new.
And that means before that you probably been lied to.
But I'm the glue, I'm never gone divide you.
I made the effort to reach out and find you.
Serenade you, rhymed you, combined you.

Real Eyes.
Realize.
Real Lies… that you tell.
You understand right?
You understand that!

Real Eyes.
Realize.
Real Lies… that you tell.
You understand right?
You understand that!

Real Eyes.
Realize.
Real Lies… that you tell.
You understand right?
You understand that!

Real Eyes.
Realize.
Real Lies… that you tell.
You understand right?
You understand that!
