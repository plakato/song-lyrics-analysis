City Lights Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


Oh city lights have led you all this way.
Where did they go tonight?
The sun is in my eyes and I'm here to find my new disguise.

See the magic shining in your eyes.
And that you're looking for tonight.

You forgot.
You forgot.
You forgot about the city lights.

No multi-talented dominions.
Building mansions without doors.
The neon of the lizard dancing on his technicolor glow.

See the magic shining in your eyes.
And that you're looking for tonight.

You forgot.
You forgot.
You forgot about the city lights.

Her street sweeper is watering flowers that you photographed last night.
The butterfly has landed on the psychedelic satellite.

See the magic shining in your eyes.
And that you're looking for tonight.

You forgot.
You forgot.
You forgot about the city lights.

You forgot about the city lights.
You forgot about the city lights.
