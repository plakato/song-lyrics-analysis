B-Boy Punk Rock 2001 Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

Check it out, y'all 
 
Whitey Ford, 
Whitey, Ford., X-Ecutioner style, 
 
Emcee am I people call me Ev 
When, I'm bustin' up the party hear my engine rev 
With high resolution in the late p.m. 
X-Men scratch the beat. While i drop this gem 
Got tints on my windows, so you can't see in 
Pack it up pack it in baby once again, 
Ain't no way to check me 
No way to wreck me. 
And shit gets hectic. If you disrespectin 
Stiller than night I'ma see my light. 
On, the top of the Marquee kid bill me right. 
You know it ain't right, but yo. It'S ok, 
See, this type of shit happens everyday 
, 
You, see this type of shit happens. Everyday 
, 
You know this type of shit happens. Everyday 
 
It goes one for the thugs two for the chickens, 
Peckerwood stats classic, like slim pickins, 
Fuck, the Democrats and the Republicans 
Got. All your cars bouncin', like a bunch of Mexicans, 
Porter rock style, I'll Touch. You, like Tony 
You, claim to keep it real, but still comin' out phony 
It's, just one emcee and four dj's 
Give us six turntables and a mic to blaze. 
I'Ma said it, like Pun in the house of fun: 
I burn hotter than the heat that's made by sun 
Got, a gun ain't, a uzi, but it weighes a ton. 
It'S B-Boy punk rock 2001 
 
It's B-Boy punk rock 2001 
 
It's B-Boy punk rock 2001 
 
World keeps spinnin'. X-Men keep winnin 
X-Men keep winnin. X-Men, keep winnin 
It's B-Boy punk rock 2001.. It'S B-Boy punk rock 2001.
