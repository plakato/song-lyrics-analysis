Bane Lyrics
by Unnamed.

Unnamed in this bitch, let me know what's happening.
I'm the guy making fuckers never ever wanna rap again.
My lyrics are so harsh when I spit bars, you'd think I'm stabbing him.
Like he's the pork, and I'm about to tear off all the crackling.
You can't keep that shit, it's way too fattening.
Just like your bars, healthy people don't want it , just pack it in.
Your bars are so washed up, you should stop writing on paper with ink.
And start drawing your lyrics with the soap in your kitchen sink.
When I touch a mic, I turn evil.
Like Slim when he teams with Royce, but I ain't reaching as many people.
But I rap as if I was.
And I don't give a toss.
Any rapper stepping up to me better be ready for a loss.
Cause I'm crazy.
Some people say he locks up his mic, incase he.
Won't stop and just sits there all day trying to reach the top.
Because he laughs when he insults people.
You'll never meet anyone who's as deceitful.
Cause you don't know Stephen, he's the opposite of peaceful.
He's just a benefit fiend.
At the age of sixteen.
He'd probably use child support money to buy weed.
Yeah that's sounds about right, I'm the scum of the Earth.
But you're still listening to me.
As I stand holding a burning cross in front of a church.
I'm the captain of the crazy train, you can call me Ozzy.
I speak on behalf of the entire underground society, proxy.
Mainstream rappers ain't where it is, I'm the future, obviously.
If you ain't here to be the best, then go home.
I'm here to be the best, so Em, when I step up to your throne.
You can give me the secret to rap immortality.
Then any rapper who wants to challenge me.
From whatever fucking galaxy.
Will learn very quickly.
When they step in proximity with me.
That Unnamed is the leader of this rap country.
And shit, while I'm down, you can try and punt me.
But know that when I get up, darkness is all you'll see.
Cause you'll get knocked the fuck out.
Like my name's Manny Pacquiao.
On some crazy shit again like i'm a re-turd.
And I won't stop 'till my lyrics have been heard.
I'm the leader motherfucker, you're just part of the herd.
You're nothing but a flock follwing the other birds.
I'm hear to revolutionize this shit, Che Guevara.
I could give up and walk out now screaming sayonara.
But before I do that shit I'd get back together with Tarra.
And that ain't ever gonna happen, so I ain't leaving.
If you ain't a fan I'll just shove my music down your throat like it's semen.
And if you don't swallow I'll kill you right now, take pictures, and put them.
through a printer.
And put the photos on your kids bedroom window.
And I'll laugh while I give him the finger.
Then I'd get the carpet and the duct tape, and I'll wrap you up like it's.
winter.
And I'll give you as a present to my favourite singer.
With a note: Hey, it's Unnamed. Wanna collab? Let me know ASAP.
How the fuck does this sick shit enter my mind?
I'm so sick, I'm ill. Call me Hopsin when I rhyme.
I go crazy when I rap, like I'm on coke or speed.
But I don't do that shit I try to stick to the weed.
Sometimes I feel so stoned, I think I'm gonna def.
But I ain't even gay, I've just smoked way too much sess.
And if you dont understand my lyrics, look that shit up.
Cause I ain't dumbing a single thing down for you dumb fucks.
And we're only half way through this track.
I'm teaching you all that skill is what I don't lack.
So while you're still being a kid, playing in the park or in the back.
I'm out here spitting bars that would give even young men heart attacks.
And you can be sure of that.
And I know I'm not black.
But that don't mean I can't rap.
Shit, Shady proved that.
And now every rapper wants to be signed to Aftermath.
So they can be with the best, the GOATs of rap. FACT.
The ones who rap as if the shit was witch craft.
The MCs who won't in a million years listen to ya.
The same rappers who will be buying my shit in the future.
It's too late to try not to go berserk.
I'm too sick, I need some time off work.
The only way you'd go viral is if your track was playing while your bitch was.
trying to twerk.
I talk so much shit, I should just put the mic up my ass.
Don't act surprised, I'm the opposite of high class.
People hear my shit and SCREAM!
They hear yours they're like Meh, pass.
Even your bitch hates your lyrics, so much she just wants to go.
But know that I could get my dick inside her like I'm tea bagging Strongbow.
You see, my words are my guns and your hate is my ammo.
So the more you hate me, the faster I'll grow.
And you should know by now, I'm not classy.
More like class E.
You're so watered down, I could swim in your bars.
And my flow is so fly, it could take you to Mars.
Lyrically, I'm in the lead, and you're just out here chasing cars.
I'm so cold bitch, I should be out there patrolling snow.
I feel sorry for you bro, every time I hear your flow.
And I ain't kidding around boy, you better know.
Unnamed is the King, you couldn't even open up for my show.

Yo fuck the instrumental, I don't have to stop just because it does.
I'll just keep rapping bitch, and that's because.
I fucking want to, a beat ain't my boss.
And there's not enough time to loop it back round like Rick Ross.
Why the fuck are these fakers even in the game, they must be fucking lost.
I'll take all the shots i wanna take, but know I'm not the guy you wanna cross.
You're the type of guy that will talk shit then back out of a fight.
And wake up in hospital to 3 surgeons all dressed in white.
Fuck it, I'll just kill you and put your body in a time capsule.
And let your kids find it at their birthday party, and that's the sick shit I.
use for fuel.
And then I ignite it and shoot at you like a fire ball.
Cause I'm the kind of guy that's liable.
To set your house on fire with an iron.
And I ain't even trying.
You try so hard to be me, and I ain't even trying.
You're all smelly cats, phoebe. And I still ain't trying.
I'm so far ahead, you bitches can't see me. And i still ain't even trying.
If me never making it is your strongest belief.
Then I'm about to turn over that leaf.
And that's the only time you'll see me do it, cause I'm never gonna change.
Yeah the styles a little strange.
I'm a little insane.
Even though something's wrong with my brain.
I'm still in the fast lane.
You fucks are walking slow with a cane.
While I speed ahead.
You heard what I said.
I'll die hard like John MacLaine.
And I control you, like you're a teddy and I'm a crane.
Just stay the fuck back before I break it, Bane.
