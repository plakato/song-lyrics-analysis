Don't Waste Your Time Lyrics
by SWV.

Don't waste your time.
You should be mine.
Come get to know my love, my love.
Don't look no more.
You can be sure.
Come get to know my love.

Baby can you tell me.
What it takes.
To get to know your love.
I want you love me in every way.
I got what you're waiting for.
Don't waste your time, no.

Don't waste your time.
You should be mine.
Come get to know my love, my love.
Don't look no more.
You can be sure.
Come get to know my love.

Here in my arms is where you should be.
No need to be alone.
I can fulfill your fantasy.
Give your real lovin' to me.

If time is what you need.

-Please-.

Don't waste your time.
You should be mine.
Come get to know my love, my love.
Don't look no more.
You can be sure.
Come get to know my love.
