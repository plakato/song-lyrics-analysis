Dance Of The Damned (Snowgoons Remix) Lyrics
by Viro the Virus.

Viro The Virus.
Man, it's like I can't cope.
Life got me smoking dope.
Pockets are broke and there's no sight of hope.
Jesus Christ or the Pope, owner of an aweful odor.
Passing by's often offer to buy me soap.
Don't know how I got to the end of my rope so soon.
Feels like yesterday I was zoning in homeroom.
Daydreaming 'bout getting home to my bowl of boom that's when it started.
Now I have a habit and can't discard it, my lifescale's uneven.
The burdens of responsibilities added their weight and as soon as graduating.
From Mary Jane to lacing my J's with lady cane.
A misguided search for relieving my brains' strain.
Now the ? thought of being sane is slain, fuck rehabilitation I went further.
? games.
More pipes and pills more leak and crills more dope and ? in search of a.
peaceful thrill.
A crackpot swap my ? pot for a crack rock.
Experimented once now I can't stop.
Thought drugs were the shorcut solution to my problems.
But they only allowed the demons to scream got him!

Viro The Virus.
If life would grant me one more chance I swear I change my circumstance and.
find a way to break out of this trance.
Change my life's rhythm.
Cause I can't stand these damn dancing demons and hate dancing with 'em.

Viro The Virus.
Yo, a trap was set and I never knew.
Now I'm the true version of the kid in the commercial dad I learned from.
watching you!
I want to quit but not sure what I gotta do.
What if I wanna make that sacrifice to take back my life.
Just wish the world would take back my wife.
I mean she's part of the stress that pushed me beyond the sense.
See I was broke when we met.
Now three years later and three seeds later she screams that she needs all of.
my check.
What happened to the sex.
Replace that with conversations 'bout the bill collectors how they're.
breathing down our necks.
? is where I turn next.
Playing the game with lucifer and lose it cause it looks like he loaded the.
decks.
? and my soul is the catch.
Wanna salvage the outcome but I'm drousy from valiums and straddle with.
poverty.
Plus I can't get a rock for free, thus I'm plotting me a robbery for my last.
chance.

Viro The Virus.
If life would grant me one more chance I swear I change my circumstance and.
find a way to break out of this trance.
Do a different dance, man if I could have one more chance at life I might live.
it right.

If life would grant me one more chance I swear I change my circumstance and.
find a way to break out of this trance.
Change my life's rhythm.
Cause I can't stand these damn dancing demons and hate dancing with 'em.

So now I'm going where the rich people live.
To break into some rich people's crib.
And take some shit to trade for a fix.
Half a day without a hit and my face begins to itch.
How did my life degrade to this, I clean my pipe and make a wish.
Dear demigod ?, elevate me to bliss.
I'm stuck in a rotten ? taking blades in my wrist.
Spent at least a decade since last I had a date go well.
So now I'm on the prowl to steal a ?, I'm in the burbs.
Troop passing youth smoking herb, hit my black heart and dip into an empty.
backyard.
Then entered through a window into a path that's distinguished.
Pocket a pocketwatch, gather up some trinkets, then bounce.
Back on the block, still feeling foul, no time for the ? I need it right now.
First cat I see, asking where the crack please?
Over there, them kids got readies, ?, powder, weed whatever you need.
I replied thanks true indeed.
Went for the kids chiefing grass I previously passed, with my pockets heavy.
Mind fantasising the readies, plan to give 'em what I've stolen for the.
bundles they're holding.
Approached then the cat spoke like waddup junkie?
If you got money you can get what you need from me.
I said I got a pipe dream and a nice watch.
Gladly trade you my nice things for some white rocks.
Peeked his interest, showed him the things I had gotten.
It seems at that instant is when things went rotten.
He looked stunned like how the fuck you get that son, that's my watch!?
Had no chance to run before he grabbed his gun, blew my last chance.

Yo, I couldn't get a second chance at life.
Too bad I didn't know that before my first chance was no more.
But oh well, I got a last chance in hell.
Maybe me and the demons will coexist well.
Exit my physical shell cause in my physical life I didn't treat it well, while.
I had the chance.
But oh well, I got a last chance in hell.
Maybe the devil'll teach me how to dance.
