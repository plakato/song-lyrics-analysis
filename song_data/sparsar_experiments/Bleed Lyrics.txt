Bleed Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


-Daddy, do you kill people?
-Do I kill people? If I have to, baby girl.
-Do they feel pain?
-Hmm. Sometimes.
-My daddy's gon' kill you!
-*chuckles*.

-Brainsick!

Out the graveyard like a zombie on The Walking Dead on A&amp;E.
Put 'em in a cage deep in the basement for disobeyin' me.
Redrum, redrum, could've been a month, shit, it really don't matter.
Normal turned out be ho and shit is not okay with me.
I be on the type of shit to make you think I'm Vorhees times ten.
? you foamin' out the mouth the.
more heed I'm in.
I'm with Bloody Mary and the Candyman every day all day.
Look a nigga in the face, no disgrace, leave no trace, I goes in.
Drag a nigga through the woods like I'm on the hunt for Bigfoot.
Flee, hit them in the knee, put the recipe in cookbook.
Do you wanna see a demon in the flesh, then take a look.

I'm Godzilla, guts hangin' where ya nuts hangin' nigga Ed Gein.
And I spend about an hour everyday in a dark room dissecting.
Chop a nigga ear off so he can't hear off my checking.
Then talk into that motherfucka like testing, testing, testing.
Run if a nigga want to stay hit with that bottle.
Same when a motherfucker showtime at the Apollo.
Hit a bitch up with the 619 like Rey Mysterio.
With a mask on my face lookin' like a nigga was Sin Cara.
I'm brazy, mama never raised me to be no punk nigga.
Walk up on you, shoot you in the face and then I put your body in a trunk with.
a.
Bitch with a big rump in her, choppin' everybody head off.
I don't really wanna get the lead off, I just wanna get a slam dunk with her.

Get ya muddy.
Shotties, bloody.
Bodies, blood, I.
Put in work.

Don't be all up in my face tryin' to blow shit.
People tryin' too hard to be noticed.
Do you wanna see a dead body, won't you people scatter like roaches.
Shaka Zulu, black magic, Voodoo, hocus pocus.
Knife'll go in ya, soul might go with ya.
How the fuck you compare a nigga when my flow is so sicker.
I don't really give a shit about like 'who can go quicker'.
When I murder anybody when I get up on a mic, I deliver.
Hoistin', mouth spittin' like it's poison.
I been ready, bring your boys in 'fore I MURDER this stupid muh'fucka!
Old dogs say you be actin' like a bitch nowadays.
Really and I be on go-ahead-and-kill-everybody just to shoot this muh'fucka.
Brainsick, I be on a different Richter.
Scale, I hit 'em with the illin' then I gotta peel 'em, in 'em on a good one.
tonight.
Werewolf a motherfucker every time a full moon is out.
I might turn into Benicio Del Toro and take flight.
Nigga, I'm cuckoo, Voodoo.
Knockin' through a nigga' speakers.
I don't really give a fuck if I ain't got shit but two tweeters.
Fuck you talkin' 'bout a dollar?
I ain't never had a motherfuckin' penny.
I'm that same nigga, used to have to wear.
Duct tape around my sneakers.
Brainy, people lookin' at me like a nigga was a weirdo.
But I don't give five fucks, two nuts or a chewed up earlobe.
I told everybody I was gonna hit the game up with a bang.
But these motherfuckers wanna run around and actin' like a nigga don't hear.
though, just bleedin'.
