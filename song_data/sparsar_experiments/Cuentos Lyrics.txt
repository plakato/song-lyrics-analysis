Cuentos Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

Breaking the line, holding my breath.
Watch me now sugar here I come in disguise I won't look back.
Winter the young high on myself.
Watch me now sugar here I come in disguise they won 't fight back.
You're waking my poets who won't.
Keep your head on your shoulders.
Your hundreds of thousands of shapes.
Will all be attending.

Me voy de este entierro.
Valen m치s mis cuentos que tu vaga intuicio패n.

Breaking the line, holding my breath.
Watch me now sugar here I come in disguise they won 't take long.
Serving the wicked has been.
Highly enchanting.
I'm folding the fabrics of death.
For those who keep smiling.

Me voy de este entierro.
Valen m치s mis cuentos que tu vaga intuicio패n.
