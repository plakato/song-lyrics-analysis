Crank Lyrics
by SwizZz.


If I told you once I won't be back, to say I told you so.
Faith is all it takes, pay attention nigga watch the growth.
Droppin' out of college made a gang of people mad.
They was stressin', now they reppin', proud I took the fuckin' chance.

That's right little nigga, SwizZzle it's official.
Get on board like a rebound, or swallow.
a roll of nickels.
The rich is gettin' richer and those riches never trickle.
Unless you take the path including a mask and a pistol.
It's very difficult to recognize the real.
Your congressman's corrupt, he's too busy cutting deals.
They're propagating bullshit and lying to pass a bill.
See, the bank just took your house while he's sitting on a Mil.
I guess nobody gives a fuck.
If shit, doesn't affect us if it ain't about a buck.
We gon' keep our mouth shut, said I'm tryna bust this nut.
Pull that ho with a big ol' butt, and tell her to back it-back it up.
Adressin' the system won't get you to listen so I'mma get back on my bullshit.
They needed somebody to come out the clutch and then SwizZzle was pulled out.
the pulpit.
Now that I'm on, like your favorite show.
I got fans that get buck in the very first row.
I see niggas is schemin' for reasons unknown.
May be hate, may be envy, I'm lovin' em both.
So I embrace it, cuz you're a fuckin' joke.
And I can sense the desperation every time you post.
Attention' cravin', quit complainin', worry about your self.
Tryna build your name off someone else will never fuckin' help.
Listen, jealousy is for the bitches bitch.
If you're lucky I might let you kneel and kiss the SwizZzle stick.
Word to DJ hoppa, cause he's scratchin' like his nipple itch.
I had to break it down because some niggas like that simple shiiiiiit.

Shit I got what you need.
A loony nigga with firm beliefs I'm a different breed.
I took the college route, I didn't have to run the streets.
I'm blessed to be a blessing for everybody that I can reach.
Cause now I'm in this bitch, like a vibrator.
Turn the music up, fuck my white neigh's.
Noise complain this, noise complain that.
Yea yea, who's making a liquor run to get the jack.
Good, there's a message in the bottle.
Or at least I thought there was so I was passing 'til I toppled.
Seeing double, laying on the pave, kissing potholes.
Blacked out, not knowing if I'm gonna see tomorrow.
Man I'm such a big deal, Groupon.
I scramble eggs butt naked with my shoes on.
You piped the duck and got the clap, two palms.
Now your shit is leaning like a noodle, udon.
Y'all Marvel at the one's that gossip.
I marvel at corporations that kill the triple profit.
They'll do anything to bath their motherfucking pockets.
While we sit back and watch it assuming it's not a problem.
My flow is Ernie, Barkley, Kenny TNT.
It's hard for people to keep up like hoes with double D's.
You could use a couple pillows to protect your knees.
They could be useful because that's where you are most of the week.
And get your ass up and do something.
You tweet about it, but prove nothing.
And grew accustomed to frontin' and livin' lies.
Talk is cheap, but you oblige.
Beneath it all, you're down and out, You run your mouth to help your Pride.

I'll give you a second to sit back and listen and soak this all in.
If you're sipping you're tripping, don't act like a gimp and get with it.

Go hard like you're ready to win.
Got a drink in my cup, it's about to get handled.
I'm not baby sippin', I came here to binge.
If you feel like I'm feelin', then toes to the ceilin'.
We bout to go ham like a string on a limb.
