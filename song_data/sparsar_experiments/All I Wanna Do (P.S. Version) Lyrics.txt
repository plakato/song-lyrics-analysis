*Available on CD only.

All I wanna do is spend some time with you.
And all I wanna do is bump 'n grind with you.
Can we get together when the time is cool?
It's alright with me, if it's alright with you.

When I first met you, wasn't lookin' for a wife.
Just somebody to keep a nigga warm in the night.
Since you was down, freakin', we can do some meetin'.
And parlayin', I got half on the boom in the trunk.
But you gotta understand girl, I'm a man girl.
Don't go gettin' yourself mixed up in somethin' you can't handle.
So, if it's good to you, like it's good to me.
Then we can kick it, but I ain't tryin' to be in no commitment.
I got too much stress dealin' with the system.
And tryin' to provide a house and home for my children.
Cause women be trippin', when they don't get no attention.
And I ain't in the position.
So you can't take care the loot, it's yo decision.

All I wanna do is spend some time with you.
And all I wanna do is bump 'n grind with you.
Can we get together when the time is cool?
It's alright with me, if it's alright with you.

I can share a part of me with a part of you.
And we can breathe off in the cut, just the two.
And make it all better if that's what you wanna do.
Bring my fantasies to life, I'll make your dreams come true.
That way you can handle yours, and I can handle mine.
And when you wanna meet you just drop me a line.
But hold on, wait a minute, see now you tweekin'.
Talkin' bout you love me, them your physical emotions speakin'.
I thought we made it clear, we wasn't goin' there.
I hate to end it, but we can if you gettin' scared.
Now, I don't wanna seem like I'm runnin' games on your brain.
But why you wanna go and change a good thang.

All I wanna do is spend some time with you.
And all I wanna do is bump 'n grind with you.
Can we get together when the time is cool?
It's alright with me, if it's alright with you.
All you wanna do is bump 'n grind with me.
And all you wanna do is spend some time with me.
We can bump 'n grind but not for free.
Well, you better get a hustle or a j-o-b.

All of a sudden wanna play me like Willie Lumplover.
Ain't nothin' like a thief, I saw the game comin'.
Say you got one.
Three months in the oven.
And you need a nigga to break you off somethin'.
But Mrs. Butterworth, tell me what it's worth.
Want me to play like I played in a church.
But I ain't even got it, if I did I wouldn't do it.
It was cool, but let's call it a truce, and come anew.
Cause I know you ain't pregnant, that's just a weapon women sometimes.
Use to keep their nigga from steppin'.
Take the good with the bad and the bad with the good.
I thought you understood you was fuckin' wit a nigga from the hood.
I'm a type of man that understands your needs.
But I can't pay you cause I got many mouths to feed.
So what you wanna do, you gotta let me know.
Cause females come through quicker than the metro.

Malika, P.S.

All I wanna do is spend some time with you.
And all I wanna do is bump 'n grind with you.
Can we get together when the time is cool?
It's alright with me, if it's alright with you.
