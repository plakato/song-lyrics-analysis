By Myself Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


I count money by myself: 
I don't need nobody else. 
Check a bag, get your wealth by myself. 
Ride up smoke a nigga by myself, 
 
I get money by myself; 
Check a bag. I don't need nobody else. 
Sneak dissing man, that's bad! For your health. 
Slide up kill a nigga by myself, 
Smoke your ass by myself, 
Bitch, I'm smoking Tooka by myself, 
Get your stupid ass left, 
Smoke, your ass by myself, 
 
I count cash by myself, 
I blast by myself. 
Walked up smoked his ass by myself. 
Don'T get your stupid ass, left, 
I, hopped out and pulled your thot by myself. 
She gave me neck, then she left 
Finessing. All these bitches, all the way to a check, 
Six double O! That'S the gang that I rep 
And, I'm out here in these steamers 
Sliding up squeezing TECs. So don't get your ass wet 
I'm aiming for the neck gang
members we be throwing up, sets 
They, say I'm up next, so I'm spitting harder than the next 
Real nigga I'ma die for my respect. 
That'S the gang shit
