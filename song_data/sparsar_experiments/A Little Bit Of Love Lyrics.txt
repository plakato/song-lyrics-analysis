A Little Bit Of Love Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Times getting tough.
Bringin' you down, down to the ground.
Tears in your eyes.
Pain is so bad that you wanna die.

Well, look here.
You've got a friend to shelter you.
When the storm clouds come in.
You'll always have me.
Just wait and see.
Our love's gonna be.

A little bit of love.
Goes a long, long way.
Lifting you up to a brighter day.
A little bit of love.
Goes a long, long way.
Turn it around when you up and say.

Everybody say love.
Can you feel the love?

You're down and you're out.
Ain't even got a damn dime to you're name.
And the world is so cold.
No one to hold and you wonder why.

Well, look here.
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off.
You're gonna shine, you're gonna shine.
