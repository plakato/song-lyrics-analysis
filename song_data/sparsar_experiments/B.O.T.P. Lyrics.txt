B.O.T.P. Lyrics
by World's Fair.


Look, I told Shorty I never heard of Cupid, had a one night stand with who.
Medusa used to be, and I paved the way for Lotharios and do some.
phantasmagoria upon every chromosome. - - - Party tonight?

It's your party! We at your party screaming fuck your party!

I slide through the door, with E&amp;J, that's company for my liver.
3 or 4 for the guest spots, I just don't give a.
Thought I wouldn't ? your function.
without my niggas.
Catch us in your green room, drinking up your liquor.
Out here, our reputation is Queens, fucking your shit up.
Got the hiccups, on the richter, after frame-knocking your picture.

Leather jackets all zippered up, fuck around and get zippered up.
Just a grown-ass man sipping liquor out of sippy cups.
Bastards of the party, where's my father, nigga I don't know.
I'm fucking up the party that you corny niggas down to go.
Fuck around, shut it down, fat bitch bend over, bustin' out.
Finna bust an ounce, till her pussy wide open.
Skeet so much, they call her Billy Ocean.
Then I'm the bad- ass- bully- gone- wild- as-.
?, slapping security, swinging billy clubs.
This your party? We at your party screaming fuck your party.
That's your father? I'll fight your father screaming fuck your father.

Cody B. Ware.
I keep my mind twisted like double dutch, this horny ?, I'd love to bust.
Fantastic, magic, super savage, average crews can't fuck with us.
Get the cold shoulder, no jacket off, in pumps, I'm fast to ball.
Kobe fur all mastadon, could you.
picture our triathlon?

Have to ask your mom, young vagabond, gone before she wake up.
You're friend bout to get ate up, and its late out, don't wait up.
You better pay up, I be in the cut and the life of the party still.
Trynna make a ho faint, if I show restraint, cause your bitches hardly will.
What up?
