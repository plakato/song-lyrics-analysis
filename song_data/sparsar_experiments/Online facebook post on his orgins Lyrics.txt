Online facebook post on his orgins Lyrics
by Russ Moshavi Chara.

This week, Russ Moshavi Chara, also known as RMC, Mosh, and Mosh Arab,.
released a post on Facebook on where he came from.

I was born in Warren and grew up around the Clinton Township-Mt. Clemens.
border. My family wasn't dirt poor but we weren't rich and I knew people who.
were very poor, living in trailer parks and projects. There was a lot of drugs.
near where I lived, especially PCP, Meth and heroin. It could be dangerous.
too, we had break ins when people were home and robberies at stores. Hell, not.
long ago that Baisal dude got shot dead in Clinton. By the time I was in 5th.
grade, we had guys sexually assaulting chicks, getting into fistfights and.
vandalizing the school. Cops often came through the neighborhood too looking.
for guys. Me and my family moved when I was in the middle of grade 6. My 6th.
grade year was chaos. We had a gang of guys who were neo-Nazis and they were.
going around attacking black, and jewish kids. I had to deal with them and.
knocked one out. One kid got beaten up so bad by them , he went to the.
hospital and they put a police car near the school the next day. We also had a.
fair share of your average black criminals too. It was so scary to be honest..
I ended up switching schools in 7th grade and things have been quiet since.
2012, but my life was chaotic until I switched schools..

I get my ideas and music from the news, hearsay, everyday life and from other.
countries. I often rap about love, anger, gangs, girls, end of innocence and.
other rappers. I add arabic phrases in like how Pittbull raps in Spanish, and.
I've really experimented. I do the classic Midwest Hip hop, but I've done Nu.
