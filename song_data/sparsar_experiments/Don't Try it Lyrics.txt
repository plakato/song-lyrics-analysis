Don't Try it Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..

{Tec-9 Talking}.
We bout to fuck em up with this one baby.
Say no mo,  *gun cocks* say no mo *gun cocks*.

F-L to the E-X-I-S, Flexis nigga, Mother fucka whats next?
Yall niggas wanna know what the truth is.
It is what it is Blazin South, we handelin biz.
Hold down blocks with shotty's spark it up in the dark.
Keep bitches to riches, dump ya body in the rivah.
Hustle all night my goal is to win the battle.
Schemin on a chicken, pickin on a meal ticket.
Dont make the Capital get wicked.
Some of this shit is not even listed.
Hennessy keeps me blisted.
Worth a nigga layed fa fuckin with my Yola.
Nigga out there bad sold a nigga Baking Soda.
I guess he never heard about the backgrounds of Tec.
Took a big chunk a meat out the head and neck.
Reckless when I'm drunk, livin on the edge.
But I pledge to keep you motha fuckas crunk.
Sinista got the funk, and we got 5 albums.
Plus a new release SHUT YA MOUTH!

Tec-9 &amp; Lil Ya}.
Tec Dont try to come uptown if you ain't about that drama.
Lil Ya Nigga gon respect the 3rd or I'ma.
Tec Bust a nigga head and make him come with me.
I told yall niggas bout fuckin with UNLV.
Dont you even try to come uptown if you ain't about that drama.
Lil Ya Nigga gon respect the 3rd or I'ma.
Tec Bust a nigga head and make him come with me.
I told yall niggas bout fuckin with UNLV.

Yo, Its gon take more than a vest to protect ya chest.
Fuck a Smith &amp; the Wess let the grenades do the rest.
Behind the coke I'll kill you and whoever.
Bustin at ya guts with my nickel plated devil.
I draw my heat quick, cock the six, spank a bitch, scared as shit.
Me and my dogs celebratin a lick.
Throw bows at the foe's if they gettin away.
Ain't nuttin gon stop me from gettin the Yay.
So often shootin guns I can't even pronounce.
Jackin dealers hey you could say they pay me allow.
Ya the bully on the block, plus I want what you got.
Gimmie ya whip, stash, cash plus ya Cartier watch.
Watch, house, wife, dogs and all ya betta up it.
Ya head I'm bout to split you done played and got me pissed.
Touched a nerve you done pissed my trigga finger off.
Dont let me unleash the demon and call my nigga Flex fa ya'll.
Haulin bodies, baggin, taggin bitch niggas.
You gotta be bout that if ya wanna be a rich nigga.

Tec Dont you even try to come uptown if you ain't about that drama.
Lil Ya Nigga gon respect the 3rd or I'ma.
Tec Bust a nigga head and make him come with me.
I told yall niggas bout fuckin with UNLV.
Dont you even try to come uptown if you ain't about that drama.
Lil Ya Nigga gon respect the 3rd or I'ma.
Tec Bust a nigga head and make him come with me.
I told yall niggas bout fuckin with UNLV.
Dont you even try to come uptown if you ain't about that drama.
Lil Ya Nigga gon respect the 3rd or I'ma.
Tec Bust a nigga head and make him come with me.
I told yall niggas bout fuckin with UNLV.
