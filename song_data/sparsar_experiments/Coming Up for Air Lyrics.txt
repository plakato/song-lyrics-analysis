Coming Up for Air Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

Am I a friend or your lover.
In expectation of your company.
Instinct, fate, isolation.
Solitude left us this way.

You are the one.
It's clear that I can't turn away.
The past we'll crucify.
We're coming up for air.

A new beginning.
The day has come, a chance to breathe again.
Could never fall, we're bound together.
By promises, the promises we made.

You are the one.
It's clear that I can't turn away.
The past we'll crucify.
We're coming up for air.
Here lies what's ours to stay.
Never could justify.
We'll walk on solid ground.
We're coming up for air.
