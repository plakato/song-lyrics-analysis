Hot Nigga (Remix) Lyrics
by XJoMaMa.


I'm a hot nigga by affiliation.
I raped your bitch, call that forced anal penetration.
Burning niggas, call that nigga incineration.
Illegal CIV, but no incrimination.
Tyler, The Creator, but on a trap beat.
The Jews hate me, ‘cause I bring the fucking heat.
Only pay in 100s, and tell them to keep the change.
We treat the streets as our own fucking shooting range.
See your squad, call that walking up on a flocka lames.
Time is money, so I don't have time to play any fucking games.

Might have to call up FEMA, just like when I dropped Katrina.
I've been grindin' my whole life nigga, know what I'm talking ‘bout.
I've been grindin' my whole life nigga, just to get that penthouse.
More low key than the nigga who made 323.
Only listen to that nigga with the beard, he's who I wanna be.
Call me J. Cole ‘cause my bars set your squad on fire.
Shea's a snake, I would never trust that fucking liar.
Everyone just spits crack rock, and black rocks.
But what about the nigga at the docks, who gets mocked.
Wearing OF socks, and ugly fucking green crocs.
Who only gets cock, to pay off his fucking punk rock.
There's blood on the leaves, but no time to grieve.
We've been making new slaves, with the tricks under our sleeves.
Make more money than your papa ever fucking will.
Look like I just sold 2 million just like fucking Meek Millz.
Niggas rap about how that make a mil in a single day.
But when you look at what they bought its still on layaway.
