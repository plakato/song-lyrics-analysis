Places To Go Lyrics
by Yuna.


I got, I got.
I got places to.
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain.
I got places to go.
I got, I got.
I got places to.
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain.
I got places to go.

I feel like we should get together.
Then maybe I, I'll feel so much better.
And this rainy weather ain't helpin'.
Boys in leather jackets.
They are walkin' by.
Yeah they remind me.
How tiring work is.
I just wanna fly away and ignore this.
I just wanna call it quits, I'm a quick fix.
While he's out there taking his.
I just need someone to break this wall of bricks I've built.

So I wanna know.
What's the weather like in Toronto.
This time of the year.
It should be so cold.
But I just need another place to go.
Cause I can't be here no more, no more.

Break.
I got, I got.
I got places to.
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain.
I got places to go.

I feel like work is overbearing me.
And what is life when you are not even living?
I am tired of it all, pleasing everyone I know.
Cause when I do it, I don't know if it's worth it.
How tiring work is, yeah.
I just wanna fly away and ignore this.
Sometimes I wanna call it quits cause it's a business.
Everyone is making hits.
I just wanna take a break from everything that I've been.

So I wanna know.
What's the weather like in New York.
This time of the year.
It should be so cold.
But I just need another place to go.
Cause I can't be here no more, no more.
Cause I wanna know.
What's the weather like in Kuala Lumpur.
This time of the year.
It's so beautiful.
I just need a place to call home.
Cause I can't be here no more, no more.

Here no more, no more.
_I got places to go_.
Here no more.
_Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain.
I got places to go_.
I can't be here no more, no more, no more.
_I got places to go.
Actin' like they feelin' my pain, my pain.
I got places to go_.
