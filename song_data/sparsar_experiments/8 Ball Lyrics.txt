8 Ball Lyrics
by Underworld.

Today, today I saw a man.
Today I saw a man.
Using an empty whiskey flask as a walkie talkie.

Today, today I saw a man.
Today I saw a man.
With a flaming 8 ball tattooed on his arm.

Today.

Today, today I saw a man.
Today I saw a man.
Using an empty whiskey flask as a walkie talkie.

Today I met a man.
Who threw his arms around me.
And I've given, and I've given.

Today.
Today.
Today.

Today.
Today.
Today.

We laughed, we laughed.
Waiting for a train.
For a few into the city, seconds.

Today, that white stuff.
That white stuff.
Waiting for the train.

That stuff into the city.
That's what makes me feel.

Today.
Feel, feel.
Today.
Feel happy.
