Mr. Fix It Lyrics
by Yung Joey.


We gon' turn the lights on. We gon' turn'em up 
We gon' make a movie to our favorite song 
And we gon' get it on. We gon' get it on 
Oh. I need a fix, be my Mr. Fix. 
We gon' turn the lights on. We gon keep'em on 
We gon', make a movie to our favorite song 
Oh. I need a fix, so be my Mr. Fix 
 
Ya. She called my phone say she she need a fix, 
We hung up and she sent some pics 
In. Her birthday suit. Super thick 
She know that I'm a plumber who fixes leaks with dick 
Turn the lights off, let your water flow 
Know, your old boy, probably fuck! You slow, 
Tonight, I'ma fine tune ya, that 
Might pull your hair, might slap your butt 
I might show aggression. 
But still be gentle use, my discretion 
Yung Joey ride me like a pony 
See, your man hating now you're worried bout, homie, 
Queens, nigga, real nigga, 
Push, you so good, I'm in the mall with ya' 
Push you so good. I had to bone with ya' 
Make a movie motion picture. 
Yung J.O., keep it J. Low, 
He bragging bout, his girl, but I fucked that hoe 
She. All at my show in the front row: 
Acting boosy, but she's a groupie 
Say. I went down you. A motherfucking lie 
In the first night I ain't motherfucking, try 
Ocean deep in that wet pussy. 
Almost drown in that wet pussy, 
, 
, Waka, Flocka Flame 
She. Nicknamed me, Biggie A.K.A., Big Poppa, 
Waka, Flocka Flame. You can call me the pantie, dropper 
She say I'm going to fast, but I slow it up. 
Pulled her hair slapped her butt 
Right leg, shaking shorty, that's! What'S up 
Two hours in I ain't had a nut, 
My supermodel chick. When she got a leak, I fix it that wet wet 
, good shit, 
Shorty, look in the mirror! Oh you, the shit, 
Two cars on spot, paying baby mama, rent 
 
Look in your eyes, feel like purple dice when I'm in between your thighs
