Mr. Fix It Lyrics
by Yung Joey.


We gon' turn the lights on, we gon' turn 'em up.
We gon' make a movie, to our favorite song.
And we gon' get it on, we gon' get it on.
Oh I need a fix, be my Mr. Fix.
We gon' turn the lights on, we gon keep 'em on.
We gon' make a movie, to our favorite song.
Oh I need a fix, so be my Mr. Fix.

Ya, she called my phone, say she she need a fix.
We hung up, and she sent some pics.
In her birthday suit, super thick.
She know that I'm a plumber who fixes leaks with dick.
Turn the lights off, let your water flow.
Know your old boy probably fuck you slow.
Tonight I'ma fine tune, ya that ?
Might pull your hair, might slap your butt.
I might ? , show aggression.
But still be gentle, use my discretion.
Yung Joey, ride me like a pony.
See your man hating, now you're worried bout homie.
Queens nigga, real nigga.
Push you so good I'm in the mall with ya'.
Push you so good I had to bone with ya'.
Make a movie, motion picture.
Yung J.O., keep it J. Low.
He bragging bout his girl but I fucked that hoe.
She all at my show, in the front row.
Acting boosy, but she's a groupie.
Say I went down, you a motherfucking lie.
In the first night, I ain't motherfucking try.
Ocean deep in that wet pussy.
Almost drown in that wet pussy.

Waka Flocka Flame.
She nicknamed me Biggie, A.K.A. Big Poppa.
Waka Flocka Flame, you can call me the pantie dropper.
She say I'm going to fast, but I slow it up.
Pulled her hair, slapped her butt.
Right leg shaking shorty, that's what's up.
Two hours in I ain't had a nut.
My supermodel chick, when she got a leak I fix it, that wet wet.
? , good shit.
Shorty look in the mirror, oh you the shit.
Two cars on spot, paying baby mama rent.
?
Look in your eyes, feel like purple dice when I'm in between your thighs.
