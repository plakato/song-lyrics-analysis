On the rocks Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Lets rush into the city try to punch the lights out.
And i'll object because we'll have to skip the make out.
There's nothing going wrong; there's nothing going down.
????, she set the path,we are walking down again.
There's nothing in your heart we've lost the fight again.
There's nothing going wrong; there's nothing going down.
Our Hearts they were strong ; Never made a sound.
Our love was on the rocks ; the day we let it out.
Nothing going wrong ; nothing going down.
Our love was not dead, but i lost the fight again.
There's nothing in your heart; it's all we got my friend.
There's nothing going wrong; nothing going down.
Our Hearts they were strong ; Never made a sound.
Our love was on the rocks ; the day we let it out.
Nothing going wrong ; nothing going down.
Lalalala....
Our Hearts they were strong ; Never made a sound.
Our love was on the rocks ; the day we let it out.
Nothing going wrong ; nothing going down.
