Curious Lyrics
by 3LW.

There's some things on my mind.
I don't know that I should be thinkin'.
Am I wastin' my time thinkin' 'bout.
You and I, and these feelings.
Cause I see you and me holdin' hands.
Doin' things, goin' further.
But they say we're too young.
And those things will come.
I'm just curious.

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious.
Nothin' more than a girl.
Comin' straight from the heart.
I'm just feelin' us.

Thinkin' 'bout you and me.
Thinkin' 'bout how it feels.
I'm curious.
I just wanna know what.
True love is, though.
I'm just feelin' us.

On the phone in my bed.
On my back, starin' at the ceiling.
When I'm talkin' to you.
What I feel, is it true?
I'm wondering.
Well I tell it, and I.
What I feel deep inside.
It keeps burning.
Does my man understand.
Everything that I am.
I'm just curious.
I'm just curious.

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious.
Nothin' more than a girl.
Comin' straight from the heart.
I'm just feelin' us.

If I could have things my way.
We'd go pass time.
Maybe we'd do the things.
I'm thinkin' in my mind.
And all the things I want to know, I'd know.
The places we'd explore, I'd go.
But now I see us both together.
Learnin' more about each other.

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious.
Nothin' more than a girl.
Comin' straight from the heart.
I'm just feelin' us.

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious.
Nothin' more than a girl.
Comin' straight from the heart.
I'm just feelin' us.

You know boy.
We both know that we have a thing for each other.
And it's natural for us to both wonder.
What it would be like.
But the time is not right.
And I hope you're satisfied.
Because I'm satisfied.
Just bein' curious.

I can't get you off my mind.

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious.
Nothin' more than a girl.
Comin' straight from the heart.
I'm just feelin' us.
