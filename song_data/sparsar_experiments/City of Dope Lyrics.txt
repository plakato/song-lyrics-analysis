City of Dope Lyrics
by Yukmouth.

Gather'Round gather'round hurry, 
Uh welcome, uh little boys and girls 
Listen, I'm bout to lace, yall motherfuckers, 
About Oakland, the City of Dope 
The first place in the world to ever sell base rock 
Nigga crack rock. They put it there to get rid 
Of the Panthers, but they really created this ballin 
What. What nigga 
 
Me and my niggas trying to ride, drop 
Buy rocks. Then we buy blocks 
From the same dope fiends on my block, who buy, rocks 
Want supply hot 
Weight. Servin cakes like IHOP 
Ever since them last motherfuckers, got shot. 
Police been hot on my spot: 
Spot cops FBI watch, 
Got, fiber-optic shit up in the pole, 
Showing my whole clique on crime watch 
We, let non-stop and show our faces 
So what the case is 
We wide on TV, but still the grind: don't stop 
Nigga this Oakland, The city of dope 
You know where that crack shit was invented. 
And smoked by these ghetto chemists years ago, 
On Plymouth street. We call the
block 
Plymouth Rock 
The first place like the world to ever sell base, rocks 
Now check it. 
The legendary Felix Mitchell put
it down 
So tough. They had to make a movie about the town, 
But called it. Nino Brown, 
That, bullshit, New Jack City, 
Is. Really based upon this place, we call Crack City 
Oakland Cali. We act shitty, 
Think crack's. The answer 
To get rid of these revolutionary Black Panthers 
Smokin' blow and takin like Jo-Jo Dancer, 
Or sniff it up your nose and ball out of control. 
Like Tony Montana, 
House in Atlanta 
3-car garage 
Our ghetto superstars was hard. 
Young niggas touch a mil-ticket 
Before. They life behind bars, 
Niggas get caught with like eighty kilos, 
Hidden in the wall, 
But shit, ain't hidden at all, 
From these cocaine, sniffin dogs 
Same with the law 
Shit in your draws when they get your ass 
And. Let the ballers ball get the cash 
Till. They get to your ass 
I've, never seen a baller fall on his knees, 
And snitch, so fast, 
Plea, bargain run after them. Niggas 
That, hang out with your ass 
No wonder why that bitch-ass nigga got out 
So, quick, so fast, 
Came on the block. My niggas saw you 
Choppin' it up with task 
Now. That'S a violation. 
Nigga can't chop it up with task 
So. While the trial awaits 
Some, nigga walks up and pumped his ass 
Because. The niggas in the O are hard as fuck 
We sell, peruvian flake, get it powdered or rocked up. 
Don'T want nothin from life, but to retire from the game. 
Motherfuckin city of cocaine, 
 
City of dope, 
East Oakland yeah, that's right, 
The city of dope, 
East, Oakland, yeah, that's right! 
, 
Them task! Folks, can't stop us! 
High school niggas get caught with a hundred G's 
Stashed in his locker, along with a chopper 
Niggas, be ballin. Like a doctor or a surgeon, 
M.C. Hammer, splurgin' 
He bought up countless brand new helicopters, 
And suburbans. Now he hurtin 
The feds spilled. They base downtown 
So. Now its curtains 
Niggas be perpin' off 
Certain, it's gon' be a sweep. 
Dope feind came through last week. 
Told me its gon na be a sweep 
1991's. The number nigga 
End of the summer 
Niggas ain't, ridin, no fuckin, hummers 
We ride under buckets and try to stay on the slunder 
I, wonder wonder what they would do: 
To a nigga who get caught with 2 pounds of thunder 
Straight from Humboldt county fuck that brown 
Weed all should be green, like the jungle, 
Dope fiends tryin, to warn us 
Settin' up scene still in a bundle, 
We beat they ass and drag them from they hair 
Just like repunzel 
Don't fuck up our hustle 
But anyway. The day came just as predicted 
I'm up at 6 in the mornin' takin early morning, pissin' 
Pulled down my britches and a nigga. Almost shitted 
I heard somebody walkin on the roof. 
I cocked the fo-fitness 
Woke, my cousin, Mike up 
Could, be some niggas sent to strike us 
Cause back then so many niggas didn't like us 
Looked out the window. All I saw 
Was FBI and snipers 
I. Let the china white flush 
And, put that motherfucking 4-5 up 
See the dope fiend. He informed us 
Told us its gon na be a sweep, and then 
He tried to warn us. 
But niggas out here, try to make they money. 
So we'nourmous 
Then! Only a battering ram. 
Bustin down your shit, ,'nourmous 
Highway patrols, 5.0's ambulance and coroners 
In case there was a shootout or high-speed chase performance. 
By 9:00. They lock down each baller from every corner, 
From north to west, on down to east Oakland. California, 
But, but them niggas from the O, is hard as fuck 
We sell, Peruvian flake powder or
get. It rocked up 
Want, nothing in life, but to retire from the game. 
With. Some change in the city of cocaine, 
, 
East, Oakland yeah, that's right: 
City of dope, 
East Oakland yeah, that's right! 
City of dope
