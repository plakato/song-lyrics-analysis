City of Dope Lyrics
by Yukmouth.

Gather 'round, gather 'round, hurry.
Uh, welcome! uh, little boys and girls.
Listen, I'm bout to lace yall motherfuckers.
About Oakland, the City of Dope.
The first place in the world to ever sell base rock.
Nigga, crack rock, they put it there to get rid.
Of the Panthers, but they really created this ballin.
What, what, nigga.

Me and my niggas trying to ride drop.
Buy rocks then we buy blocks.
From the same dope fiends on my block who buy rocks.
Want supply hot.
Weight servin cakes like IHOP.
Ever since them last motherfuckers got shot.
Police been hot on my spot.
Spot cops FBI watch.
Got fiber-optic shit up in the pole.
Showing my whole clique on crime watch.
We let non-stop and show our faces.
So what the case is.
We wide on TV but still the grind don't stop.
Nigga this Oakland, the city of dope.
You know where that crack shit was invented.
And smoked by these ghetto chemists years ago.
On Plymouth street we call the.
block.
Plymouth Rock.
The first place like the world to ever sell base rocks.
Now check it.
The legendary Felix Mitchell put.
it down.
So tough they had to make a movie about the town.
But called it Nino Brown.
That bullshit New Jack City.
Is really based upon this place we call Crack City.
Oakland, Cali we act shitty.
Think crack's the answer.
To get rid of these revolutionary Black Panthers.
Smokin' blow and takin  like Jo-Jo Dancer.
Or sniff it up your nose and ball out of control.
Like Tony Montana.
House in Atlanta.
3-car garage.
Our ghetto superstars was hard.
Young niggas touch a mil-ticket.
Before they life behind bars.
Niggas get caught with like eighty kilos.
Hidden in the wall.
But shit ain't hidden at all.
From these cocaine sniffin dogs.
Same with the law.
Shit in your draws when they get your ass.
And let the ballers ball, get the cash.
Till they get to your ass.
I've never seen a baller fall on his knees.
And snitch so fast.
Plea bargain run after them niggas.
That hang out with your ass.
No wonder why that bitch-ass nigga got out.
So quick, so fast.
Came on the block my niggas saw you.
Choppin' it up with task.
Now that's a violation.
Nigga can't chop it up with task.
So while the trial awaits.
Some nigga walks up and pumped his ass.
Because the niggas in the O are hard as fuck.
We sell peruvian flake, get it powdered, or rocked up.
Don't want nothin from life but to retire from the game.
Motherfuckin city of cocaine.

City of dope.
East Oakland, yeah that's right.
The city of dope.
East Oakland, yeah that's right.

Them task folks can't stop us.
High school niggas get caught with a hundred G's.
Stashed in his locker along with a chopper.
Niggas be ballin like a doctor, or a surgeon.
M.C. Hammer splurgin'.
He bought up countless brand new helicopters.
And suburbans, now he hurtin.
The feds spilled they base downtown.
So now its curtains.
Niggas be perpin' off.
Certain it's gon' be a sweep.
Dope feind came through last week.
Told me its gonna be a sweep.
1991's the number nigga.
End of the summer.
Niggas ain't ridin no fuckin hummers.
We ride under buckets and try to stay on the slunder.
I wonder, wonder what they would do.
To a nigga who get caught with 2 pounds of thunder.
Straight from Humboldt county, fuck that brown.
Weed all should be green like the jungle.
Dope fiends tryin to warn us.
Settin' up scene still in a bundle.
We beat they ass and drag them from they hair.
Just like repunzel.
Don't fuck up our hustle.
But anyway the day came just as predicted.
I'm up at 6 in the mornin' takin early morning pissin'.
Pulled down my britches, and a nigga almost shitted.
I heard somebody walkin on the roof.
I cocked the fo-fitness.
Woke my cousin Mike up.
Could be some niggas sent to strike us.
Cause back then so many niggas didn't like us.
Looked out the window, all I saw.
Was FBI and snipers.
I let the china white flush.
And put that motherfucking 4-5 up.
See the dope fiend he informed us.
Told us its gonna be a sweep and then.
He tried to warn us.
But niggas out here try to make they money.
So we 'nourmous.
Then only a battering ram.
Bustin down your shit, 'nourmous.
Highway patrols, 5.0's, ambulance and coroners.
In case there was a shootout or high-speed chase performance.
By 9:00 they lock down each baller from every corner.
From north to west on down to east Oakland California.
But, but, them niggas from the O is hard as fuck.
We sell Peruvian flake powder or.
get it rocked up.
Want nothing in life but to retire from the game.
With some change in the city of cocaine.

East Oakland, yeah that's right.
City of dope.
East Oakland, yeah that's right.
City of dope.
