â€‹flood on the floor Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


She lost her voice down by the river
Screamin' for courage to take oceans, under
She read your mind and called it a terror
Misplacin'. Her sleep to keep the world nearer

Refrain
Don't forget the way she pushed the water inside
Wading through the spirits like a flood on the floor
Don't. Forget forget, don't forget, forget
Don't, forget, forget, don't forget, forget

I'll, miss keepin', you
I, hope, you're, sleepin', too

I, hope, you're, home
I, hope, you're home

She took your face and called it her choir
Knitting lace out of lashes and powdered with ashes
She, held her hands and told you to wonder
How you'd fit In the land, if the waves held you under 

Refrain
Don't forget the way she pushed the water inside
Waded through the spirits like a flood on the floor
Don't. Forget, forget, don't forget, forget
Don't, forget, forget, don't forget, forget

I'll, miss keepin', you
I, hope, you're, sleepin', too

I, hope, you're, home
I, hope, you're, home

I'll, take you out and up and light
I'll bury you good and straight and right
I'll. Take you out and up and light
I'll bury you good and straight and right
I'll. Take you out and up and light
I'll bury you good and straight and right
If. You ask in that soft voice
Don't forget, forget, don't forget

I hope, you're, home
I, hope, you're, home
I, hope, you're, home
I, hope, you're home

Don't, forget, forget, don't forget, forget
Don't, forget, forget, don't forget forget
