​​repetition Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray

Tell me that you wan na move me'round like that
I, will watch your lips curve in a smooth combat
Make. Your way in, through my tears and I'll relax
If you're, the truest one, I'm gon na, make you a season
Climb up in my rattling spine and I'll contract
Tell me, I'm the only one and I'll move back
If. You see your daydreams in me, they'll not lack
What's, been weighted in me I'll make you quake with reason

Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
Hope. It isn't repetition
Though, that's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
Hope: it isn't repetition
Though, that's the only thing that keeps and takes you

I can feel your knees sinking into the bed
Searching in my dark eyes to break. What'S been said
There's a wake of grace hunting your soreness down
There's, a light in my skin. That'S been dimmed
I'mma, dig you up and give you what I took
Pull you up and tuck you in and make you look

It was all forlorn. If only for a season

Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
Hope. It isn't repetition
Though, that's the only thing that keeps and takes. You
Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
Hope. It isn't repetition
Though, that's the only thing that keeps and takes you

Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray

Interlude
It was all forlorn. If only for a season

Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
Hope. It isn't repetition
Though. That'S the only thing that keeps and takes you
Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
Hope. It isn't repetition
Though, that's the only thing that keeps and takes you

Even, though it's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey, pray
