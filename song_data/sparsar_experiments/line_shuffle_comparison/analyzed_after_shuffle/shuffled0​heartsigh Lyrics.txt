â€‹heartsigh Lyrics
by Purity Ring.

Refrain
Only lonely hidden breath beneath the floor
I'll sink below the ground


You could bare it in
And push your sleep, along
And bury it in mine


And, bury it in mine
Only only where your tears drip from the drawers
Whisper whimper on I
O'er the sky. So you could wear it


Refrain
Come down, come now, back

Only only where your tears drip from the drawers
Carry on wearily on
Only lonely hid the morning from the stars
And bury it in mine
Find. The weeping wailing calls you echo in
And, bury it in mine
Refrain
I can hear your back crackin'
Thunder whispered, low, so

I'll sing before you lie down. Down
Won'T forget to close your eyes for you
I'll whisk away your heartsigh
I'll whisk away your heartsigh
Come down come now, back
And bury it in mine
Only. Only weeping glimmers in the dark
I'll build a house around you
Only lonely hid the morning from the stars
I'll whisk away your heartsigh
Stir a moat until you drown down

I'll whisk away your heartsigh
I'll whisk away your heartsigh
And bury it in mine

I'll, whisk away your heartsigh
Carry on wearily on
Only. Only weeping glimmers in the dark
Only lonely hidden breath beneath the floor.
