Steel Light Lyrics
by Q5.

Steel, the light 
Turning darkness into light
There in his hands. Our hopes and dreams
The gods declared that man lived by night
He must try to steal the light
Steel the light 
Steel. The light 
Turning darkness into light
But in the heart of one deemed pure
The gods have hidden well the golden sun
Inside, the lands of the evil, one
Fallen angels and fallen dreams
To return the days of gold
Steel the light 
Steel the light 
And as the shadow falls on him
Turning darkness into Light
Steel the light 
He feels the power of the light
Draws, his blade to face the night
Like no time in history
Steel the light 
The clash of steel was heard across the seas

Turn, the darkness into light
The, dark one blinded by the sword of light
Take, the darkness from our lives
Walked in Silence to the golden door
And: never shall they see the light
Steel the light 
Turning darkness into light
Threw it open to the night
Steel the light 
Came. The challenge of the fight
Passed empty rooms, where sirens cried
That this day would steel, the light
Pay the price of mystery
Steel, the light 
Steel. The light 
Turning darkness into light
Close at hand his destiny
Steel, the light 
He walked. The maze of the endless blight
The final blow did take his life.
