Dancin' Man Lyrics
by Q.

Straight from the horse's mouth
 Got ta get up, get it on
Hey, dancin' man 
You, know. They'Re doing this thing up, north
 Got ta, get up, get it on

All she needs is a dancin' man
Hey buddy. You ain't gon na make that chic
Just sitting and running your mouth
 Got ta get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get the guitar reeling
Put down that drink and do it right, quick
 Got ta, get up, get The guitar reeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get the guitar reeling
When. You can't feel that groove
All she wants is a dancin'. Man
He knows how to move them. Feet
 Got ta, get up, got ta, get that feeling
How. Can you sit still when music's hot 
 Got ta get up, get the guitar reeling
Say? Don'T you know I've got that news
But. You got ta get out of your seat. Yeah yeah yeah
All she wants is a dancin' man
Swear, sometimes you're all nailed down
But. It'S started way down. South
 Got ta, get up, get it on
All she wants is a dancin' man
Hey dancin' man, 
You got ta, come up and move
Cause dancing's. What it's all about
 Got. Ta get up, get it, on
 Got ta, get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, get the guitar. Reeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
 Got ta, get up, got ta, get that feeling
 Got ta, get up, get it on
You can stop and go find all that you want
 Got ta, get up, get it on.
