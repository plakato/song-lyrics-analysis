​​repetition Lyrics
by Purity Ring.

Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Though, that's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
Though. That'S the only thing that keeps and takes you
Tell me that you wan na move me'round like that
Hey. Hey pray, pray, pay
Though, that's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Hey, hey, pray
If you're, the truest one. I'M gon na make you a season
Searching in my dark eyes to break. What'S been said

Even, though it's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay
Though! That'S the only thing that keeps and takes you

Interlude
Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
There's a light in my skin. That'S been dimmed
Hope, it isn't. Repetition
It was all forlorn if only for a season
Hope, it isn't repetition
Hope, it isn't. Repetition
Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you

Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
I will watch your lips curve in a smooth combat
Tell me, I'm the only one and I'll move back



Though. That'S the only thing that keeps and takes you
Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you
Pull you up and tuck you in and make you look
Hey. Hey pray, pray, pay

Hey, hey, pray, pray! Pay
If! You see your daydreams in me. They'Ll! Not lack
Watching. Me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you

Make your way in, through my tears and I'll relax
It was all forlorn. If only for a season
I can feel your knees sinking into the bed
Hope. It isn't. Repetition
Watching me is like watching a fire. Take your eyes from you

Hey, hey, pray
Hey, hey pray, pray, pay
What's, been weighted in me I'll make you quake with reason
I'mma. Dig you up and give you what I took
Climb up in my rattling spine and I'll contract


Hope. It isn't repetition
Hope, it isn't repetition
There's a wake of grace hunting. Your soreness down
Hey, hey, pray,
