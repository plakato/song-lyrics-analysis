A Dead Man's Words Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.

I trace what's left of my cold steel.
As it twitches.
Apply the tourniquet tight, savor the moment.
This might be my last sip of life.

I see these one hundred miles.
Of shifting, stirring sand.
A forsaken man in this strangers' land.
They've left me for dead.

I'm so tired of feeling scared.
But I've got to find a way.
I've got this gun in my hand.
I got blood on my tongue.
As I write dead man's words.

The word we hear is.
There's one man down, and he's alive.
They ask for volunteers, I raise my hand high.
I'm sure he'd do the same for me.

It's three days through the desert heat.
To save one man's life.
And I don't even know his name.

I'm so tired and my thirst is strong.
I might not make it back alive.
I've got my gun at my side.
There's just one fear I can't hide.
And it's a dead man's words.
Dead Man's words in the sand.

Out in the desert, so tired!
And I don't even know his name.
I will keep my head down!
I'm so tired but there's no way out.
But...ahead!
I will not die out in the desert!
I will not die!
I will keep my head down!

How many days pass? Hard to tell.
In the desert, the wind says nothing.
I move, the bullet bites, infected to the bone.
Will it find its home before me?
I pray that you find me soon.
Before I slip away.

I'm so tired but I've got to hang on.
I've just got to make it one more night.
I've got this gun in my hand.
I've got blood on my tongue.
One last time I write dead man's words.

I'm tired, so tired.
I keep my head down.
I'm so tired.
I will keep my head down.
Keep my head down.
