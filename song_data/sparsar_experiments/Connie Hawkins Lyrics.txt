Connie Hawkins Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.


I got a bag of agriculture as I watch a band of vultures 
Drag, my culture through the desert, picking meat up off the soldier
 
Got, the heat up on my shoulder in the valley, moving boulders 
They, say it's colder at night, but I can't tell the difference. 
My Cold Vein made me sleep unwell as an infant 
I was limping through high school, but I guess that went away. 
I got a GED for everything I never meant to say: 
I got my'rents rent to pay. They got a brand new Sub' 
While. I still fall short of hood rich by a grand or two 
Can't expand hand to hand. So what a man to do? 
When, no man's with your plan when you ran it through 
Might end a warrior's career like Xanadu 
Not with the hammers man strictly with the stanzas dude 
Goddamn, who planned to let this damn bonanza through 
Implanted with adamantium 
you, xannying crews. 
Ain'T zany just insanely samey now pay me my dues 
When. I slay these rap tracks. Caps and craniums ooze 
Couldn't find iller animals in Iranian zoos, 
Inhaling uranium daily til, it's scaly and blue 
I'm iller than a Palestinian-Israeli dispute. 
I'M iller than militaries killing and burring youths 
And. I ain't sharing the trees. If we ain't sharing the roots, 
But, there's no holds barred on what I share in the booth. 
Idiots invite ignorance in and glare at the truth. 
My style's unorthodox like the way Marion shoot. 
Carrying loot and I don't got a care in the world 
 Gon na break off a little piece that I can share with my girl, 
Never rest like the Middle East, and she don't care if it's plural 
I'ma act, a fool and break your backboard
