Poor Boy's Dream Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

Well this is how the story goes.
It's never really been a one man show.
The muddy waters to roll the stones.
And I wish the truth below.
There's one kid driving all night in his car.
There's another in his room strumming his guitar.
He don't do it for the money.
He don't do it for the heart.
It's a poor boy's dream.
Well there's some out there chasing big bright lights.
You know fancy cars the finer things in life.
That's well and good but it don' mean much to me.
Well I hope you sleep sound when you close your eyes.
And when the sun goes down you know I'll come alive.
We'll hit the town.
Just singing on that poor boy's dream.
Poor boy's.
Poor boy's.
Poor boy's.
Poor boy's.
Singing that boor boy's dream.
Poor boy's.
Poor boy's.
Poor boy's.
Singing that poor boy's dream.
Well all good things must come to an end.
When one man leaves off you know another begins.
A brand new song with a distant melody.
You may play for gold you may play for change.
But if you listen close it all sounds the same.
Like a thousand golds just singing on a poor boy's dream.
Like a thousand golds just singing on one poor boy's dreams.
Like a thousand golds yeah this is just a poor boy's dream.
