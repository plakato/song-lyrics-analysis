Afterglow (Of Your Love) Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Love.
Love is all around me everywhere.
Love has come to touch my soul.
With someone who really cares.
No one can deny us.
People who once passed me by.
Just turn their heads 'round.
I'm happy just to be with you.
And lovin' you the way I do.
Cause everything I need to know.
Just resting in the afterglow of your love.
You have always been.
A feeling deep inside.
A feeling that I could not see or touch or try to hide.
My love is deep and around you.
I bless the day that I found you.
So listen baby.
I'm happy just to be with you.
And lovin' you the way I do.
Cause everything I need to know.
Just resting in the afterglow of your love.
Love is like a voice in my head.
Keeps turning 'round the things that I'm saying.
I'm happy just to be with you.
And lovin' you the way I do.
Cause everything I need to know.
Just resting in the afterglow of your love.
I'm happy just to be with you.
And lovin' you the way I do.
Cause everything I need to know.
Just resting in the afterglow of your love.
I'm happy just to be with you.
And lovin' you the way I do.
Cause everything I need to know.
Just resting in the afterglow of your love.
