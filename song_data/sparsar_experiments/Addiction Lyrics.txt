Addiction Lyrics
by Womanly Hips.

He got into the game by hangin' with his friends 
Now. All he does is play without end 
Used to be casual, just every
now and then 
But. Now, when he looks back at where the hours went, 
Spent more time trying to escape than live, 
Got no time for any relationships, 
All the friends he had, he just control or delete â€˜em 
Fiending, forgetting what patience is 
Can't wait? Til, he clicks lights out, blinds down. 
Man-Made eclipse in the place he sits, 
Either going crazy, yelling or as quiet as a mouse 
Old mates stop trying to take him out. 
Why go to the pub he's happy at his own space bar 
Place, far away in another world 
A world. That'S much better! Wow escape forever 
Never anybody to monitor his
obvious addiction, 
Honestly forgot. It was odd. He preferred the fiction 
Only time he sees the wind blow 
Is when he looks through Windows. 
But fuck spending his whole life in a stupor 
He's got ta, get up and unplug the computer 
X2
