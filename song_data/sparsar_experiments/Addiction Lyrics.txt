Addiction Lyrics
by Womanly Hips.

He got into the game by hangin' with his friends.
Now all he does is play without end.
Used to be casual just every.
now and then.
But now when he looks back at where the hours went.
Spent more time trying to escape than live.
Got no time for any relationships.
All the friends he had he just control or delete â€˜em.
Fiending, forgetting what patience is.
Can't wait, til he clicks lights out blinds down.
Man-made eclipse in the place he sits.
Either going crazy yelling or as quiet as a mouse.
Old mates stop trying to take him out.
Why go to the pub, he's happy at his own space bar.
Place far away, in another world.
A world that's much better, wow escape forever.
Never anybody to monitor his.
obvious addiction.
Honestly forgot it was odd he preferred the fiction.
Only time he sees the wind blow.
Is when he looks through Windows.
But fuck spending his whole life in a stupor.
He's gotta get up and unplug - the computer.
X2.
