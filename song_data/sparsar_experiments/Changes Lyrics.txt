Changes Lyrics
by Volume.


Changes, changes.
So many things have changes.
So my music so tameless.
Even though im so fameless.

Air blowing on me, I ain't talking fans.
I'm just talking followers the twitter is on demand.
Triple jumping, met sand.
Lyrics written by my right hand.
Wanna be with Wiz Khalifa.
I be on that taylor gang.
Always been trying.
Bringing up my name.
Wanna feature in some songs.
With meek milly and the game.
Become a rapper.
Not for the money or the fame.
Just wanna be that teen.
Who's lyrics are insane.
Tim Westwood.
From England my hood.
That's good.
Our music is still up there.
Ye it should.
Came to the court, hitting swishes Kobe.
When it comes to cars, im on that Aston.
Yall should know me.
Milly soon be my homie.
Bad chicks fuck out.
Good chicks stay in.
All those bad chicks.
I'm Telling you no way in.
West coast state of mind.
You can call me Kendrick.
Cleaning all your teeth.
I'm a motherfucking dentist.
My music still small.
No plays on soundcloud.
When it gets big.
They go hunt it like a dog hound.
Fuck out of my car.
NASCAR.
In that competition motherfucker.
Get a fast car.

Changes, changes.
So many things have changes.
So my music so tameless.
Even though im so fameless.
