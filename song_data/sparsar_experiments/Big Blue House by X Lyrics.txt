Big Blue House by X Lyrics
by X.

The sun is down behind the Safeway.
The snow is pink on a mountain.
The black and white dog is under the table.
Spaghetti is boilin' on the burner.
Would you please stop listenin' to your eyes crackin' open.
Would you please stop watchin' the sound of your heart in the mirror.
In the big blue house, in the big blue house.
I don't want to scatter your ashes.
The floor is dirty enough as it is.
And I don't want to speak of you kindly.
Besides the phone is upstairs.
Would you please stop wishin' that you could stop wishin'.
That you could float out of your life like a cloud.
In the big blue house, in the big blue house.
In the big blue house.
Calm down, calm way down.
Everything's gonna be all right, everything' gonna be all right.
In the big blue house.
Would you please stop wishin' that you could stop wishin'.
That you could float out of your life like a cloud.
In the big blue house, in the big blue house.
In the big blue house.
Everything's gonna be all right, everything' gonna be all right.
In the big blue house, in the big blue house.
In the big blue house, in the big blue house.
