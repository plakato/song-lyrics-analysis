Big Blue House by X Lyrics
by X.

The sun is down behind the Safeway. 
The snow is pink on a mountain 
The black and white dog is under the table. 
Spaghetti is boilin' on the burner. 
Would, you please stop listenin' to your eyes: crackin' open 
Would! You please stop watchin' the sound of your heart. In the mirror, 
In the big blue house in the big blue house - 
I - don't want to scatter your ashes 
The floor is dirty enough as it is 
And. I don't want to speak of you kindly 
Besides. The phone is upstairs 
Would. You please stop wishin' that you could stop wishin' 
That! You could float out of your life like a cloud 
In. The big blue house in the big blue house, 
In, the big blue house, 
Calm down calm way down 
Everything's gon na be all right. Everything' gon na be all right: 
In, the big blue house 
Would. You please stop wishin' that you could stop wishin' 
That. You could float out of your life like a cloud 
In. The big blue house in the big blue house, 
In, the big blue house, 
Everything's gon na - be all right. Everything' gon na be all right. 
In, the big blue house in the big blue house 
In, the big blue house in the big blue house, 
\ --, .
