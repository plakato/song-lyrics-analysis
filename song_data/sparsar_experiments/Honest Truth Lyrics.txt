Honest Truth Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


Handle the honest truth.
Triple.

So whatchu tryna do.
It's Triple T yo this the honest truth.
So whatchu tryna do.
It's Triple T yo whatchu tryna do.
So believe me when I tell you this the honest truth.

Midnight in Paris.
My mind is the clearest.
When I avoid mirrors and puddle for public appearance.
This shit is a game.
It's never gon change.
I voted both times but things always staying the same.
I love to complain.
She love to not bang.
We better without each other because of the close range.
Long distance, my freestyle is vicious.
Watch out for negatives they always taking pictures.
Plus I got scriptures.
Hieroglyphic mixtures.
They think I'm going crazy cause I'm always throwing missiles.
And I'm misguided.
But I kinda like it.
Confused with the mic shit.
But nevertheless I stay writing.
On the wall, ????
Pour trots of some hot spots.
Got your girl in Lamaze.
Got my investments in God.
With Triple's future being crazy and kuh, k-kinda odd.
Kuh, k-kinda odd.

I wanna tell everybody here the truth.
I want everybody to just hear the honest truth.

Cause this the honest truth.
Triple come together like a rendezvous.
Believe me homie.
Cause it's the honest truth.
This the honest truth.
Triple come together like a rendezvous.
This the honest truth.

You know I've run my last campaign.
So, I don't need to spi-.

Listen fool.
So whatchu tryna do.
Thirty three doing work yeah it's kinda true.
We do it first we on the roof you should check the view.
It's Two Thirds or you could say a wrecking crew.
My homies always got my back so who be repping you.
My tan soldiers kick knowledge you should check the two.
Thirds, headed to the top we destined to.
Killing beats is a crime that I'm confessing to.
But when I'm in the booth.
I'm never resting dude.
You can never succeed without work and that's the honest truth.
You know my taste designer to.
It's Young Spiz yo whatchu tryna do.

I'm tryna make cream and that's that.
Cream and that's that.
Cream and that's that.
I'm tryna make cream and that's that.
Cream and that's that.
Cream and that's that.

Told you I was hot.
