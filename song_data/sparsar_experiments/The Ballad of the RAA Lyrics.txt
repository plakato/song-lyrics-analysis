The Ballad of the RAA Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

We unbearably left the prairies, and my heart.
Since well it never moved an inch.
Does the love grow, home with the wild rose.
Now, something's moving out here.

We unbearably left the prairies, and my heart.
Since well it never moved an inch.
And then you found me, alone on a Friday.
Now, something's moving out here.

Swap Garneau for Dundas.
My parents for your dad.
The Rockies for the Great Lakes.
And my heart pounds as you say.

Swap Garneau for Dundas.
My parents for your dad.
The Rockies for the Great Lakes.
And my heart pounds as you say.

All these things twill pass.
It's the good ones that will last.
And right here what we've had.
Is a good thing and it will last.

And all these things will pass.
It's the good ones that will last.
And right here what we've had.
It's a good thing and it will last.
