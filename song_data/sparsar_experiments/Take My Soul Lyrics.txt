Take My Soul Lyrics
by Woodie.


This music thang.
I'm doin' it for my family and my homies.
Im tryin' to leave some cash in they pockets before I go.
The clock is tickin', it's just a matter of time.

If enemies lay me down to sleep.
I pray to the lord my so he'll keep.
When i die in this life of hate.
I pray to the lord my soul he'll take.
WOODIE.
In this life of sin.
God tell me where do I begin.
I've rejected you my whole life, but now im listenin'.
Accepted you as my friend.
My heart is open hopin' for a change.
But I' still a killer inside.
I feel it in my veins.
Ain't got the strength to rise up out this concrete battlefield.
Cuz i still feel the urge to kill.
Cuz snoop still ain't got outta jail.
Plus my closest homeboys deceased.
I gotta seek revenge.
But who do I avenge.
Sometimes I catch myself overlookin' my true friends.
I'm tryin' to see through all the lies and deceit to make.
Intelligent decisions that'll keep me on my feet.
But evil ways make me stray and i get caught up in the same shit.
Riskin' my life to represent so enemies know i'm dangerous.

Livin' that life, this gangbangin' done took it's toll.
On the outside i'm fine but inside i'm outta control.
Tryin' to stay outta prison but the streets pursuade my goals.
When I lay down to die will good or evil take my soul.
Livin' that life, this gangbangin' done took it's toll.
On the outside i'm fine but inside i'm outta control.
Tryin' to stay outta prison but the streets pursuade my goals.
When I lay down to die will good or evil take my soul.
WOODIE.
As i'm sittin' in my room oil'n up my strap.
I'm thinkin' back on all the different pistols that i've packed.
All the dirt that i've done with different weapons and guns.
And how much fun I had when I was young.
Earnin' my stripes one by one.
They added up sin at the scene I didn't realize it then.
But now I understand there's consequences for every action.
Lord could you forgive me for my sins up till today.
But what if I kill again tomorrow does that mean you feel betrayed.
Cuz I can't promise you, that i'll do.
What the bible tells me not to.
If I feel I gots' to ride.
Im goin' to ride with or without you.
No disrespect intended.
Don't take me for satan's child.
Cuz 5-0 got my dirty deeds.
Gathered up in the gang files.
Look at my loyalty.
The love that I got for my family.
If anybody could.
I know you would understand me.
So when they call my number.
And I take my final breathe and die.
Please forgive me for my sins.
And let my soul rise to the sky.

Livin' that life, this gangbangin' done took it's toll.
On the outside i'm fine but inside i'm outta control.
Tryin' to stay outta prison but the streets pursuade my goals.
When I lay down to die will good or evil take my soul.
Livin' that life, this gangbangin' done took it's toll.
On the outside i'm fine but inside i'm outta control.
Tryin' to stay outta prison but the streets pursuade my goals.
When I lay down to die will good or evil take my soul.

If enemies lay me down to sleep.
I pray to the lord my so he'll keep.
When i die in this life of hate.
I pray to the lord my soul he'll take.
WOODIE.
I lived another day.
Now it's time to live another night.
I take it minute by minute.
And hope somehow I do it right.
I gotta fight to keep hope alive.
That snoop will get released.
But it's the red-suited beast.
That gets' the blue suited police.
Societies already got us marked.
As killers, dealers, and thugs.
Gang bangers shoot'n them slugs.
Drug dealers movin' them drugs.
Ain't no love on this side of the tracks.
That's why criminals run in packs.
Who else gonna have our motherfuckin' backs.
You think our president ain't a sinner.
He's the cruelist of all.
He's the one, killin' the inncocent with missles and bombs.
While we just up in the street tryin' to maintain human nature.
That have enemies so we gangbang.
Lord if you could shed any light up on this life of mine.
I'd be willing to listen to you at the drop of a dime.
Because im suicidal at times.
And at times im homicidal.
Livin' on the borderline damper my chances of survival.

Livin' that life, this gangbangin' done took it's toll.
On the outside i'm fine but inside i'm outta control.
Tryin' to stay outta prison but the streets pursuade my goals.
When I lay down to die will good or evil take my soul.
Livin' that life, this gangbangin' done took it's toll.
On the outside i'm fine but inside i'm outta control.
Tryin' to stay outta prison but the streets pursuade my goals.
When I lay down to die will good or evil take my soul.
Lord, I got a question.
Will you fogive me for my sins if I don't regret 'em.
Cuz sometimes no matter how hard I try, I feel no remorse.
I feel I had to do what I had to do.
But then again maybe it's just the Old-E numbin' the pain.
I dunno 'but send Blackbird my Love.

If enemies lay me down to sleep.
I pray to the lord my so he'll keep.
When i die in this life of hate.
I pray to the lord my soul he'll take.
