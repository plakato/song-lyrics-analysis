Heist (Target exclusive) Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


Like a man on the run.
I ain't got no place to hide.
Got one hand on my weapon.
Pray that God is on my side.
Your skin looks so cold.
Your eyes they rob me blind.
But your spell takes its hold on me.
I got mischief on my mind.

Your hocus pocus.
So mysterious.
With all your hocus pocus.
First she's there and now she's gone.
It's the heist.
She stole my heart like a thief in the night.
It's the heist.
Better watch your back.
Might take your life.
It's the heist.
Straight up luck.
In the roll of the dice.
It's the heist.
Better watch your back.
Might take your life.
It's the heist.

I'm a dog on a leash.

It fills the air and sticks on me.
Like sex and cigarettes.
Her touch feels so cold.
Her lips taste like wine.
It's your spell that takes its hold on me.
I got one thing on my mind.
