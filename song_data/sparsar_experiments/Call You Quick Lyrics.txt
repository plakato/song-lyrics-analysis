Call You Quick Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

Call you quick.
But you never really catch me.
Whos the trick that is sucking down my pride.
Youre alone.
So baby dont you call me.
Ring, ring, ring.
Wasting all my time.
Right now, a fire inside her room.
She's, deliciously keeping the time with her moves.
And, this is something new.
And Im a just fooling for you.
I like the way that you pay your dues.
Youre willingly dropping a bomb on a fool.
So, its time for revolution.
Our emotions fly like flowers in June.
Could it be you?
Call you quick.
But you never really catch me.
Whos the trick that is sucking down my pride.
Youre alone.
So baby dont you call me.
Ring, ring, ring.
Wasting all my time.
She feels comfortably in the mood.
And, the devil is throwing a party with you.
She, stands a five foot two.
And her eyes are blue.
Arent you, ready to start the groove.
Im falling and loving and Im coming with you.
So it's time for my explosion.
