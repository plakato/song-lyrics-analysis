Glad - Revised Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Everywhere you go, perfection.
Follows you the wrong, direction.
And you will never see it for.
You get all that you need and more.
You see it, you want it.
You find it, it's yours.
But you can't say what you want or.
Take what you want or.
Choose the moods that you fake when you want.
You said your life couldn't get much better.
Where it's at, yeah.
And aren't you glad.
The only one of five, exception.
The child of your pride, deception.
And on your list of things to do.
Is make me fall in love with you.
You find one, you want one.
'Coz I'm one, who plays, yeah.
Well,you can't say what you want or.
Take what you want or.
Choose the moods that you fake when you want.
You said your life needed something special.
Which you don't have, yeah.
You can't say what you want or.
Take what you want or.
Rest and wake anyway that you want.
You said your life couldn't get much better.
Well, here I am, yeah.
And aren't you glad.
Now you got it bad.
I know you do.
You can't say what you want or.
Take what you want or.
Choose the moods that you fake when you want.
You said your life couldn't get much better.
Then where you're at, yeah yeah.
And you can't say what you want or.
Take what you want or.
Rest and wake anyway that you want.
You said your life needed something special.
Which you don't have, yeah.
Well, aren't you glad.
Well, aren't you glad.
Aren't you glad.
