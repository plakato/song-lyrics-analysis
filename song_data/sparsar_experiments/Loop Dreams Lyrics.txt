Loop Dreams Lyrics
by Quelle Chris.


Tellin' you, this is the year.

Wakin' up in the same place every fuckin' day.
Yeah, motherfuckin' right, no fuckin' way.
Stressed out, tryin' to figure out the best route.
And the chest out, so no one knows that I'm stressed out.
Cause everybody wanna see you at your best now.
You vice is the outfit, who's your set now?
Say I'm your favorite rapper out, but the sales ain't legit, so.
The labels soundin' like schizos.
Feelin' like I work from the bottom to the bottom here.
And I done see the bottom of too many bottles here.
No fast whips, no mansions, and no models here.
Just my next breath, little checks, and mo' problems here.

Eye the whole pie, take no slice deals.
Got empty arms, can't no beats and no mics fill.
I done chill where the thieves and the night chill.
And dwell where the rich and the right dwell.
I done see niggas rise like the hot air.
And all I got to show for it is standing right here.
Same jeans, free tees, and some Nike Airs.
The OGs treat a G like the young heir.
I understand why some left and never came back.
I can't promise you it'll always be the same Black.
I just want my 40 acres and a playback.
So I can stuff Garcia Vegas and just lay back.

Loop dreams, loop dreams.
