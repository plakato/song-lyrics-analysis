Cab Driver Lyrics
by The Zolas.

I'm gonna hold your eye an extra beat.
You're gonna lean, lean towards me in your seat.
And though I know it's a feeling I should shake.
I'm gonna love you to cancel my mistakes.
I had a girl until just one week ago.
And every day my misery just seems to grow.
But for tonight I'll suck it up and play the rake.
I'm gonna love you to cancel my mistakes.

My friends in the back room.
Sit like children in a ring.
When the bottle's empty.
Then the game gets dizzying.
Crawling all over each other.
What would mother think?
My friends in the back room.
Singing come on, come on in.

You invite me up, dishes piled up in the sink.
I ask myself have I had too much to drink?
I'm gonna break every window in your place.
I'm gonna love you to cancel my mistakes.

I don't want to be the cab driver.
When all the love is in the back seat.
I don't want to be the cab driver.
Someone else can be the DD.
