Christmas Love Lyrics
by 3LW.


Early in the morning.
I smell the breakfast.
Mama's gone and dressed up the table.
I love this time of the year.
At a time when I know I should be nothing but thankful.
Something's got me sitting here troubled.
And I've been thinking bout it.
And I don't understand.

Shouldn't just be at this time of the year.
The love that you be showin your.
Family and friends should be.
Always and forever love.
Not just Christmas love.
Shouldn't just be at this time of year.
He gave his life for you.
Just to show you his love for you.
Always and forever love.
Not just Christmas love.

All of the children are outside playin.
And all the parents in the house singing.
There's so much joy in the air.
But what about yesterday?
And what about tomorrow when the snow melts away?
And what about the other day after?
Will we realize that his love is forever and always?

Break:.
What about yesterday?
The day after and the day after that?
Shouldn't just be at this time of year not just christmas love.
