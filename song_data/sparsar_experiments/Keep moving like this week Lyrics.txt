Keep moving like this week Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

I have so much money i can't fold it in a bank paper flying in the air the.
bigger the drink the faster u fall cameras be flashing when i walk through the.
sidewalk sweep the streets with the cleaners bright lights flashing every.

we enable the switches to turn on the cars in the lot take pictures when night.
hits high to the ceiling never dropping down easy humble people last longer.
tough people die faster leave the hate alone let the high ranks take care of.
it let go or things will get worst for Death wishes are to bad to handle let.
the light take care of it keep moving like this week.
