Immortalized Lyrics
by 3X Krazy.

Phone conversation for 25 seconds.

Bart.
We on a paper chase!
I see it all through my third eye.
You played it fast so we ??? push it worldwide.
It's juss a mental suicide, Kamakazie.
Got the plug on this game, so we on the plane Friday.
Finally, its a motherfuckin hit.
Clicks fists of four-fifths, Steady Mobb in this bitch.
I see his eyes wide, his wig split up.
On some murderous an half of his mutha.
Fuckin clan was on some other shit scramblin.
Them bullets through his skin tissue.
It's America's host.
You knew the game never fit you.
It's all official.
His last breath was on his line front.
Immortalized, his time has come.

Immortalized!
Blood shot red my eyes.
When the gun shots spread the skies it ain't no where to hide.
I swear to God, a credit card can't account for the hate.
Boy it's too late, theres no escape we already plannin ya wake.

Keek Da Sneak.
Uh, break me down.
Roll me up an hit it.
Don't shake me now.
Take another hit, I want you to feel it.
This the realest.
This is what you'll be hearin through the backstreets, starrin.
Hit the baron.
But dont forget, always check ya side views, an ya rear-end.
Niggas fearin, for the fact that you havin paper, an you dealin.
Ridin fetti, an a couple of hatas gon catch you when you ain't ready.
Like Redman, take it ??? ??? from the back.
To the head from lettin it seen ???
Casket bed me.
But instead me, I'mma live through it all.
I spit an fall.
I've been feelin like that since 2 Raw.
Like Above The Law.
I was off that V-S.
Bitin titties through the bra.
An nigga we juss.
Get a kick outta breakin the law.
An then dig this.
Cuttie that be breakin me off.
An I need this.
So I'm tryin to snatch it all.
Its scratch an fall.
I'd rather stay on top an ball.
So my family is set when death calls.

Ridah of Mob Figaz.
Now what they thought?
That I'd give up an get caught.
After I.
Grab the nine an headed straight for the vault.
When there ain't never been a battle that I fought an lost.
Wit out my... opponnent bein traced out in chalk.
But I still ain't satisfied.
So peep the rapid-fire.
This'll be the day I die, fuck rappin, I'll retire.
Negotiators said he'll provide, the paper I desire.
But he's a liar.
An I'm tired of bein lied too.
So we die too, when I ride through.
Bustin in wit the hostages.
Killin me, the guilt in me, fuck the cops an shit.
Spectators see the caper, holla Stop this kid!
But its too late.
I fear no fate, plus shootin straight.
An its funny.
Cuz all I ever wanted was some money.
An someone to suck me like they had no teeth.
Now all of a sudden these motherfuckers wanna know me.
Call me down, sayin Ridah let the hostages free!
But I'm on some, fuck the world shit, an I don't know.
I guess I'm stressed off the bullshit.

Fed-X of the Mob Figaz.
I've done adapted to this environment.
Now they can't stop me.
A Mob Figga.
Military tactics menace to society.
One of the chosen five.
That lead immortal lives.
Snatchin' all the product.
Breakin' every bone in the closet.
I'm out to get the data.
The top secret information got me took.
I'm bendin' every law in the book.
I fled the scene with two nines in the sky.
Sereal number scraped with no trace.
And known to race.
To get this pace.
Imported weapons.
Army fatigues and body vests.
I'm restin', for armageddon, with the illuminati.
Tales of Demias, Twentieth century, raised right.
It's third war!!
Busted hinges and broken doors.
Interrogation and infiltration on the five.
Immortalized!

Nigga!

You know what I'm sayin?
We've known to hustle since the beginning of civilization.
Until this motherfucker.
You know what I'm sayin.... burn out.
That's all it's gon be.
We ain't did nothin but breed in this shit.
You know what I'm sayin.
Young niggas... you know what I'm sayin... all of us.
You know what I'm sayin.
All of us.
Get ya money, watch them lights.
Knock on you, knock on me.
Fuck it, you know what I'm sayin, til it's over wit.
Thug it out til the end of civilization.
You know what I'm sayin?
Against all odds.
Until we die, ride until we die.
Mobbin it out, Money Ova Bitches.
Money ova all that shit.
First priority, it's over all of it.
Niggas ain't goin no where, we in this motherfucker.
Until this motherfucker.
Go, until this motherfucker burn out!
FUCK IT!! {*echoes out*}.
