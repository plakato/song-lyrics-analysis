Back To LA Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

Was it something I said or something I did to you.
Was I out of my head or was there just someone new.

You hear them say, „You'll never know until.
She's gone away.
Today it's my turn.
Now I know the heart can break in two.

All I'll send is a simple text that says.
I miss you and the way we kiss.
I can't get your taste up off my lips.
So come back to LA.
I know that I won't forget you quick.
Hope I'm the one you always miss.
If you can't get my taste up off your lips.
Then come back to LA.
We were dreaming in red this must be our big mistake.
Cause forever was said, not „Hello. Love. Heartbreak..

You hear them say, „You'll never know until.
She's gone away.
Today it's my turn.
Now I know the heart can break in two.

All I'll send is a simple text that says.
I miss you and the way we kiss.
I can't get your taste up off my lips.
So come back to LA.
I know that I won't forget you quick.
Hope I'm the one you always miss.
If you can't get my taste up off your lips.
Then come back to LA.
We were dancing on the rooftop.
Underneath the rain drops.
Whispering baby don't you ever stop.
So come back to LA.

All I'll send is a simple text that says.
I miss you and the way we kiss.
I can't get your taste up off my lips.
So come back to LA.
I know that I won't forget you quick.
Hope I'm the one you always miss.
If you can't get my taste up off your lips.
Then come back to LA.
I found out you're harder to forget.
You're the one I always seem to miss.
If you come around when you're back in town.
Just say hello cause I've always been in love with you.
And I wasn't meant to miss you.
