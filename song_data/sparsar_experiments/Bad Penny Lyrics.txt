Bad Penny Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

I have a letter from her.
When she worked for the Woman's Realm.
And all the things she promised me.
She promised herself as well.

She said, I want my freedom..
And ran off along the beach.
It's hard to love a girl so near.
Yet so far out of reach.
Yet so far out of reach.

She came back when the tide came in.

She said, Don't ring while he's here..
And gave me back my poetry.

She expected me to understand.
As she's always done this before.
And now she asks me.
Why don't you send me poems anymore?
Send me poems anymore.

And she steals more than she buys.
You can see it in her eyes.
And she'll come back as soon as she's ready.
She's a bad penny.

Then she comes back and asks me.
To sing all her favourite songs.
As if she's never been away.
As if she's done nothing wrong.

But I've come to the conclusion.
That she doesn't realize a thing.
And she probably still thinks I love her.
And she doesn't know that it's a sin.
She doesn't know that it's a sin.

And she steals more than she buys.
You can see it in her eyes.
And she'll come back as soon as she's ready.
She's a bad penny.

She'll come back as soon as she's ready.
She's a bad penny.
She'll come back as soon as she's ready.
She's a bad penny.
