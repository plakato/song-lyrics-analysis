Things Are Ackward Lyrics
by Viza.

Things are getting a little awkward for myself.
Things are getting a little awkward for you and no one else so I ask myself.
And you'll never get to see my face again!
And I'm never coming back!
I'm on the verge of completely losing it!

And I'm never coming back here again!
And you'll never be my friend!
I'm on the verge of completely losing it!

Things are getting a little awkward for myself.
Things are getting a little awkward for you and no one else so I ask myself.

And you'll never get to see my face again!
And I'm never coming back!
I'm on the verge of completely losing it!

And I'm never coming back here again!
And you'll never be my friend!
I'm on the verge of completely losing it!

Things are getting a little awkward for myself.
Things are getting a little awkward for you and no one else so I ask myself.
