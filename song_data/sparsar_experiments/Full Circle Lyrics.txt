Full Circle Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


Yo, you know what I always wonder.
Where the fuck is Triple T headed.
Nam saying like.
We take this rap game seriously.
We don't take no shortcuts.
We always try to put out our best product, you know.
But where we going.
Whatchu think Spiz.

I keep it vicious with the way I be dishing.
And you don't have to listen.
When I say I'm simplistic.
Cause I be running not slipping.
It's Triple T in the kitchen.
You got the problems dismiss them.
I ain't a victim.
Turbo got the vinyls he flip them.
I'm always standing on the tip.
And my currents always ripping.
I'm serving with my shit.
From my cup I take a sip.
But now I'm on my second win.
You claim some real but you pretend man.
I be rolling out ten with my friends.
Popping and finishing ends.
Will I come down it depends.
Making money past and present tense.
So take a picture and I break the lens.
But when we fight we make amends.
And I scoop you in a Benz homie.
So quit reaching cause you don't know me.
I've got the shine of like six rollies.
I fell behind on my paper folding.
My cribs a mansion and I know what's golden.
I got the hat with the NY sewed in.
Now hold it.

I think.
I think I wanna be famous.
I mean that would be dope as fuck, right.
Whatchu think, Thought.

I start from scratch like a pinch hitter.

I'm just a go getter.
Flow hitter.
Keep a bad shaped girl with the good figure.
Go figure.
I'm so sicker.
Tell her I be making ends.
She says ? like yellow signs.
Or Griffeys like Kens.
I'm like baby it depends.
I'm good with the pen.
But I'm better when I see your friends ten.
See almost always I would say it's time to figure more.
But lately my figure's have figured kinda near the floor.
Gotta install an elevator.
They whining but I'm no connoisseur.
I'm just kinda sure.
That you lightweight like Coors.
And I am in the freight game like Coors.
Plus my laces is the color of some Asian decor.
Thought, I'm a mysterious dude.
Making curious moves.
I'm not Syrian but I got on some serious jewels.
Triple.

You know what, fuck that shit yo.
I'm not doing this to be famous.
I'm not doing this for the money.
I'm just doing this cause that's what we love to do, right.
I mean like, yeah touring the fucking country in a bus.
Yeah that be cool.
But I'm just tryna be real.
I'm tryna express myself with this music.
I'm tryna talk to people in a new way.
I don't know.
Maybe that's just me.
