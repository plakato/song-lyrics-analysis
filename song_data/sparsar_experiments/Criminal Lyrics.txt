Criminal Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

I thought I had it locked up tight, had the only key to my life.
Thought I built the walls up high enough.
I was king of the neon lights, wore the crown on Friday nights.
I was winning the losing fight â€˜til you showed up, yeah.

You kicked my door in and stole my heart away and.
Took all my lonely nights and ran off with my bad days.
Girl you didn't leave nothing but the wonderful.
You're a beautiful criminal.

How'd you get away with this, I thought it was just a kiss.
I ain't been the same since you laid it on me.
Yeah baby you wrecked this place with just a smile on your pretty face.
It's all changed didn't leave a trace of the old me, baby.

You kicked my door in and stole my heart away and.
Took all my lonely nights and ran off with my bad days.
Girl you didn't leave nothing but the wonderful.
You're a beautiful criminal, yeah.
You're a criminal.

So take it all girl, I won't stop you.
Oh and I'm so glad that I caught you, now I got you.

You kicked my door in and stole my heart away.
Took all my lonely nights and ran off with my bad days.
You didn't leave nothing but the wonderful.
You're a beautiful criminal.
Baby you're a criminal, yeah.
You're a criminal.
You're a criminal.
