Blackmail Lyrics
by The Runaways.

You didn't care you went and broke my heart.
I'll get ya back you know it's gonna start.
You gave me pain that's whatcha done to me.
When I get through you'll be sorry you met me.

You'll wish you were never born.
Blackmail, blackmail.
I'll make you pay.
For the life that you tore.
Blackmail.
Black.
Mail.

You put it to me and now we'll play my game.
I'll wrap you up and you'll go insane.
It took so long and I waited my turn.
You pay your debt I'm gonna make you burn you know.

You'll wish you were never born.
Blackmail, blackmail.
I'll make you pay.
For the life that you tore.
Blackmail.
Black.
Mail.

I know about you and I'm gonna tell.
The way I planned you're gonna go through hell.
Now you listen to what I'm about to say.
Or you won't live to see the light of day, you know.
