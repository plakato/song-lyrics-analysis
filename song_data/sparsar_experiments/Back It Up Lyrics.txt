Back It Up Lyrics
by YungKing.


Whats up?
Whats up?
Back it up.
Back it up.

Shawty whats up? How you doing?
Let's pour it up, and get to it.
I just got my mind on you.
Gripping on your hips, while I grind on you.

Shawty Back it up.
Go and Back It Up.
Go and Back it up.
Go and Back it up.

Shawty back it up, every time I'm on her.
She want me, know that I want her.
She got a big booty, I wanna hit it.
Beat, beat, beat it, I know I'll get it.
Shawty want to ride thats whats up.
Go and pour it up, fill my cup.
She want to go and do me, give me some booty.
Yup she a cutie, damn girl oowee.
Oh my gosh on how you moving.
The way you dance is so amusing.
Oh my gosh, she choosing.
Yung King is the one she doing.
Oh she bad, yup she bad.
She was with me and her man got mad.
I was chilling, and she was feeling.
Feeling all up on me.

Shawty whats up? How you doing?
Let's pour it up, and get to it.
I just got my mind on you.
Gripping on your hips, while I grind on you.

Shawty Back it up.
Go and Back It Up.
Go and Back it up.
Go and Back it up.

She eyeing at me she know that I want her.
Looking so bad I wanna put it on her.
The way she looking make me wanna beat, beat it.
Lemme see it from the back, lemme see, see it.
Oh my gosh, ah ah ah.
Got me stuck on you, lala.
Those clothes coming off tonight.
About to give it all, gonna give you this pipe.
Make you feel good, I'ma treat you right.
Touch you all over while I grab and bite.
Girl whats up with you and that phatty.
Wanna hit it from the back while you call me daddy.
Do you like it rough or do you like it slow?
It's whatever you like baby I can give you more.

Shawty whats up? How you doing?
Let's pour it up, and get to it.
I just got my mind on you.
Gripping on your hips, while I grind on you.

Shawty Back it up.
Go and Back It Up.
Go and Back it up.
Go and Back it up.
