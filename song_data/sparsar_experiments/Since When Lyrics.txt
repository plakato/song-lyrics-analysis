Since When Lyrics
by Rushlow.

Yeah, I'm doin' just fine, everything's goin' great.
She's so out of my mind, totally erased.
I've got it together.
I'm better than I've ever been.

Since when, why am I kidding myself?
From the moment she left, I've been over the edge.
And I can't pull out of this spin.
Well, I haven't been myself, since when.

She used to believe, I was made to love her.
And I, I can't even think of tryin' to love another.
But maybe I've changed.
I'm not the man I was then, yeah.

Since when, who am I tryin' to fool.
I can talk till I'm blue, I'm still over the edge.
And I can't pull out of this spin.
I haven't stopped thinkin' of her, since when.

She used to be my whole world.
My life revolved around hers.
Maybe it could again.
Maybe I'll get over this.

Since when, why am I kidding myself?
From the moment she left, I've been over the edge.
And I can't pull out of this spin.
Well, I haven't been myself, since when.

I can't quit thinking of her.
I haven't been myself, since when.
