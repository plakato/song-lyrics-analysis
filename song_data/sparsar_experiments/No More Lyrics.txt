No More Lyrics
by 3LW.


I'm getting a lil' tired of your.
Broken promises, promises.
Lookin at your pager.
Seein different numbers and numbers.
Call you and you say you.
Hangin with the fellas, the fellas.
Hangin with my girls.
You always gettin jealous 'n' jealous.
I was with you when you didn't.
Have no dollas, no dollas.
Hangin at the crib.
Chillin wit your mama, your mama.
Never fronted you.
Never brought the drama, the drama.
Now you flip the script.
Playa please.

No I'm not the one.

No I'm not the one.
You do or you don't!!!

You do or you don't don't.
You will or u won't won't.
No more, no more baby I'ma do right.
You can or you can't can't.
Be a man be a man man.
No more, No more baby I'ma do right.

Ya treat me like a lady when you open doors 'n' doors.
Then you wanna front when you're wit your boys, your boys.
How you gonna play me when I bought your clothes, your clothes.
The ones that you be wearin when you wit your dogs, your dogs.
I know you never thought that I would have the nerve, the nerve.
To think about it most since you at the curb, the curb.
Blowin up my pager say you want a chance, a chance.
Listen when I say it, playa please.

You do or you don't don't.
You will or u won't won't.
No more, no more baby I'ma do right.
You can or you can't can't.
Be a man be a man man.
No more, No more baby I'ma do right.

I just wanna know what happen to our love.
We used to be best friends.
Where did it go wrong.
When u gonna see how good it is with me.
I'm tired and I'm through with all ur....listen baby!

Yo Yo Yo.
A yo, you promised me Kate Spade.
But that was last year.
Boy in the eighth grade.
And you ain't biggie, baby boy.
So it ain't one more chance.
When your friends around u don't wanna hold my hand.
And now you see a girl stylin' and wildin' inside the mix.
Hoppin out the whips, the whips, the 5, the 6.
Yes fly chrome, so pardon my tone.
Here go a quarter, go call Tyrone.

You do or you don't don't.
You will or u won't won't.
No more, no more baby I'ma do right.
You can or you can't can't.
Be a man be a man man.
No more, No more baby I'ma do right.

No I'm not the one.

No,I'm not the one.

No, i'm not the one.

No, I'm not the one.

No, I'm not the one.

No, I'm not the one.

No, I'm not the one.

No, I'm not the one.

You do or you don't don't.
You will or u won't won't.
No more, no more baby I'ma do right.
You can or you can't can't.
Be a man be a man man.
No more, No more baby I'ma do right.
