Miss Me To Death Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

This house now stands hollow
Darkened halls sit empty
No footsteps on the floorboard
Now that i'm a memory
I tried to change my fate
But still the great beyond awaits

Is this. My final chapter, 
Exiled to the mire
Forgotten purgatory
Void of angels or choirs
I, tried to shut death's door
But despair was all there was in store

I hope. You miss me to death
I hope you miss me to death
In peace. I can't rest
One answer still alludes me
Was i, the hero. 
Or was i the villain 
I guess now only time will tell

Wallpaper torn and peeling
Cobwebs choke the corners
Dessication sets in
These vermin. Are my mourners
I tried to change my fate
But? Still, the great beyond awaits

Heaven turned a blind eye
For. The rules i defied
Banished to a torment
Of, my own dreadful design
I, tried to shut death's. Door
But despair was all there was in store

I hope. You miss me to death
I hope you miss me to death
In peace. I can't rest
One answer still alludes me
Was i, the hero. 
Or was i the villain 
Was i the hero. 
Or was i the villain, 
I guess now only time will tell
