Elouisa Lyrics
by Swiss (DE).

All the guys are lining up cause as if they just wanna dance.
Don't you worry baby, music sets me in a trance.
Cause I'm shaking off the working day and I'm moving through the night.
Don't you worry sweetness, I've come to make it all alright Coming off the day.
and I'm high and feeling free.
Shaking off the day, it feels so good just you and me.
Coming off the day and I'm high and feeling free.
Asking so much to get in line Elouisa, is my Mona Lisa.
We're on top of the world again, we're on top of the world again.
Elouisa, all I wanna do is please ya.
We're on top of the world again, we're on top of the world again She looked at.
me It feels so fresh to see you dressed in those cut black jeans.
I'm not superstitious but I wonder what it means.
And I see you looking back at me, pointing to the skies.
I'll be here awaiting, fighting off the other guys Coming off the day and I'm.
high and feeling free.
Shaking off the day, it feels so good just you and me.
Coming off the day and I'm high and feeling free.
Asking so much to get in line Elouisa, is my Mona Lisa.
We're on top of the world again, we're on top of the world again.
Elouisa, all I wanna do is please ya.
We're on top of the world again, we're on top of the world again She looked at.
me And it drives me a little bit crazy, just the way she moves to the music.
She loves to make you freak out.
What you need as though she sold you out Elouisa, Elouisa, Elouisa, Elouisa.
We're on top of the world again Elouisa, is my Mona Lisa.
We're on top of the world again, we're on top of the world again.
Elouisa, all I wanna do is please ya.
We're on top of the world again, we're on top of the world again I can hear.
your SOS and I'm coming for you.
I'm sending a signal and it's coming through.
