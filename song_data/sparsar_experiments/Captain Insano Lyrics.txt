Captain Insano Lyrics
by Two-9.


See ten tons of animal fury leap from the screen.

New to labels, wipe my dick on her navel.
She appreciate my fortune, she pour liquor for the fallen.
Automatic machines, I'm in a parker all morning.
Mastermind, scared of white folks.
I ain't demonic, just designer.
When she suck my dick, she always tell me time her.
I mean traffickin' my end, I want a xan.
But liquor makes me happy, I'm a mothafuckin' monster.
Kill kill, burn burn, until they stop 'em.
They always kill a giant, The Big Show.

Metropolis fight to survive flamin' holocaust.
See helpless beauty in a brace of 36 ft monster.

Hey, I'm not lyin', bro. Bro, when I told , I say you tryna' go with me?
She was like, yeah. But I'm tellin' you, right away, I literally walked the.
fuck away from her. I seen ass. I seen titties. I'm like, Woah. You ain't.
got no ass, you ain't got no titties. I need mo' than that ?. I'm goin' home.
with ass and titties, bro. I'm tellin' you right now, bro, I got head for 2.
hours. My auntie sleep. My mama sleep. The fuckin' washer and dryer is.
runnin'. That's the only reason I got good head cause' them bitches was loud..
That bitch was loud.
