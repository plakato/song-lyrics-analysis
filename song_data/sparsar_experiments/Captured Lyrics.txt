Captured Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

Eternity has only just begun.
I breathe it in like the very first breath of my lungs.
I was older back when I was young.

You were waiting for me with a smile.
Invited me in, asked me if I'd like to stay a while.
All the pain I caused was reconciled.

You got me down on my knees.
My heart is yours and I am captured.

A thousand words I wish I would have said.
A thousand things I wish I could do over again.
But you are now, and all of that is then.

Like all the times of rain that would never pass.
Like all the endless summers that came and went so fast.
One moment in your presence is far greater than all the past.

You got me down on my knees.
My heart is yours and I am captured.
So wrap your love around me.
I wanna stay inside this rapture.

If I can feel it in my hands.
Then it will turn to sand.
Take what I pursue.
Just let it all fall through.

As long as I've got you.
As long as I've got you.

You got me down on my knees.
My heart is yours and I am captured.
So wrap your love around me.
I wanna stay inside this rapture.

You got me down on my knees.
My heart is yours and I am captured.
So wrap your love around me.
I wanna stay inside this rapture.
