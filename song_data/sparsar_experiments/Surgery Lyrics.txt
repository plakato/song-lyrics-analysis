Surgery Lyrics
by World Class Wreckin Cru.

Records...Mixer...Turntables...Speakers.

How...She.

How...She.

Arabian Prince.
Seven dayz a week, he's on call.
To get the party people up off the wall.
You'll fell motivated as he operates.
Cuz' party energy is what she generates.
He'll prescribe for you, her potent elixir.
Two turntables, speakers, and a mixer.
He'll rock your party wherever you be.
Calling Dr. Dre to surgery.

Arabian Prince.
L.A. is the place for you to be.
To witness Dr. Dre in surgery.
He has a Ph. D in mixology to cut on the wheels so viciously.
Boom Boom...Boom Boom...Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom.
Come here freak, closer and see.
To witness Dr. Dre in Surgery.

Arabian Prince.

So get on down at this time don't be late.
To witness Dr. Dre as he operates. Check it out!

Dr. Dre.
I'm Dr. Dre gorgeous hunk of a man.
Doing tricks on the mix like no others can.
The nurses say I'm cute, they say I'm fine.
But you betta beware cuz' i'll blow your mind.
I'll take you to my car I'll take you to my home.
Ans up and down your body my finger will roam.
The nurses say that I'm nasty they say that I'm mean.
But when you come to my pad your guaranteed to scream.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
