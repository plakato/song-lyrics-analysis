Dr. Dre 
I'm, Dr. Dre, gorgeous hunk of a man 
Doing tricks on the mix like no others can 
The nurses say I'm cute, they say: I'm fine, 
But, you betta! Beware! Cuz' i'll blow your mind, 
I'll! Take you to my car I'll. Take you to my home 
Ans up and down your body. My finger will roam. 
The nurses say that I'm nasty they say that I'm mean 
But when you come to my pad your guaranteed to scream 
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
