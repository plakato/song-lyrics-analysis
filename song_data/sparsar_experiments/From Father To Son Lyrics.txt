From Father To Son Lyrics
by Vision.


Let me tell you something, i just sat here thinking about your comments. i'll.
fucking tell you anything i wanna tell ya; if you were in front of me right.
now i'd smack ya. don't tell me about a hard day, cause you dont even know.
what a hard day is you little fuck! don't you ever talk to me that way again..
and when you learn how to apologize, you call me back. goodbye!
