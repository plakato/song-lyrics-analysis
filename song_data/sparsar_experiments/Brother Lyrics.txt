Brother Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.

When it's all said and done.
And you're a little worse for wear.
And it hurts having someone take care of you.
Never let you go.
Never let you go.
Even when the madness has broken you apart.
I used to believe.
That all the absence of color.
Would make a difference to my red, red heart.
But my perspective has changed.
Since I drove you away.
But baby everybody's gotta move.
Everyone's gotta move sometimes.
And I won't see it.
Even if I know it's there.
Never let you go.
Never let you go.
Even when the madness has broken you apart.
But I'll never let you know.
I'll never, I'll never.
But I'll never let you know.
I'll never let you know.
I used to be free.
Of any fear of emotion.
But these skeletons got ways of coming out.
I used to believe.
That someday you'd see.
That baby you got devotion in every little motion.

And I won't see the storm.
When the rain's coming down.
Never let you go.
Never let you go.
Even when the madness has broken you apart.
Even when the madness has broken you apart.

But I'll never let you know.
I'll never, I'll never.
But I'll never let you know.
I'll never let you know.

I will wait.
For the day you come home.
And it hurts to see you all over again.
Never ever let you go.
Never let you go.
Even when the madness has broken you apart.
