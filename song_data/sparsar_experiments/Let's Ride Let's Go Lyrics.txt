Let's Ride Let's Go Lyrics
by VonBock.


They tell me hip hop is dead 
But. Frankly, that's not the conclusion in my head, 
It's, steady, breathing waiting for the reason 
Cleaning out it's system. Then it's back to the beatin' 
 
I'm bumpin', The Chronic from 2001 
Puffin' on Chronic labeled Blueberry yum 
People, always asking you what's up man 
Why, they always buggin'. On that little kid. Justin 
 
Because radio stations, 
Should playing genres commercials are claiming 
Aqua vitae corporate guys 
But. This is the way I like to philosophize 
 
So. If you wit me raise them middle fingers up man 
Light a joint, let the stereo bump fam 
So. If you wit me raise them middle fingers up man 
Light a joint, let the stereo bump, fam, 
, 
Put them middle fingers up get them eyes: real low 
Juice County man. Let'S Ride, Let's Go 
Put it all upon the game and let's get this dough. 
So put em in the air man: let's let it show 
 
Now I've told you da problem. I'Ve got solutions. 
It might be considered a radical conclusion 
Accept. This kill em with the 16's 
Ain't no bartender, but I'm all about the mixing 
 
Lyrical laryngitis, my voice, real sick, 
And actors, like you just - can give real dick 
Hip Hop. A lady got ta fuck her right 
Don't need all the glamour. Just got ta be nice 
 
Yeah, I'm a white boy, never been scared. To said it. 
Just come prepared to get scared and beheaded. 
I cut with the mic. I stab with the words 
I'm taking over throne in a lack of words, 
 
Come up on me. If you notice me 
And see if I got the skills to flow, it free 
I'll, kill you, your mans, your crew, 
Cos', that's what a raw rhymer do.
