Let's Ride Let's Go Lyrics
by VonBock.


They tell me hip hop is dead.
But frankly, that's not the conclusion in my head.
It's steady breathing, waiting for the reason.
Cleaning out it's system, then it's back to the beatin'.

I'm bumpin' The Chronic from 2001.
Puffin' on Chronic labeled Blueberry yum.
People always asking, you what's up man?
Why they always buggin' on that little kid justin?

Because radio stations.
Should playing genres, commercials are claiming.
Aqua vitae, corporate guys.
But this is the way I like to philosophize.

So if you wit me raise them middle fingers up man.
Light a joint let the stereo bump fam.
So if you wit me raise them middle fingers up man.
Light a joint let the stereo bump fam.

Put them middle fingers up, get them eyes real low.
Juice County, man, Let's Ride Let's Go.
Put it all upon the game, and let's get this dough.
So put em in the air, man let's let it show.

Now I've told you da problem, I've got solutions.
It might be considered a radical conclusion.
Accept this, kill em with the 16's.
Ain't no bartender but I'm all about the mixing.

Lyrical laryngitis, my voice real sick.
And actors like you, just can give real dick.
Hip Hop a lady, gotta fuck her right.
Don't need all the glamour, just gotta be nice.

Yeah, I'm a white boy never been scared to said it.
Just come prepared to get scared and beheaded.
I cut with the mic, I stab with the words.
I'm taking over throne in a lack of words.

Come up on me,if you notice me.
And see if I got the skills to flow it free.
I'll kill you, your mans, your crew.
Cos' that's what a raw rhymer do.
