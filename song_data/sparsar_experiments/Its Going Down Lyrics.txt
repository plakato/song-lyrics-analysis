Its Going Down Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


What's hannin' bitch?
Betcha cain't do it like me.
Haha.
Bitch, its Nasty!
Look.

These bitches be frontin', they don't know hustlin'.
Don't gangbang, bitch I be duckin'.
Outside with the squad we on beat bussin'.
Investigation be quiet, say nothin'.
Mobbin' in public, I ain't change shit.

My teeth and my chain match the gold on my wrist.
Don't rap bout that life if that ain't what you live.
Why you actin' like a child and you far from a kid.
Long nights in my cell man I write my own shit.
Kidnappin hoes like I'm on some home alone shit.
I'm the only V-Nasty like some never clone shit.

You could crown me the king, bitch I'm on my throne shit.
Hunnid k in my closet, double that, what I sleep on.
You bitches pawns in the game Ima be on, you could be gone.
I hope you ready, bitch its going down.

Its goin' down, its goin' down.
I'm in ya city, bitch, its goin' down.
I'm mobbin, I'm ?, I'm ridin', we slidin'.
And we slidin' in a bitch its goin' down.

It's goin down, its goin down!
I kill a bitch quick she want another round.
I'm up top, she in the ground.
You say you goin' loud, well I don't hear a sound.
