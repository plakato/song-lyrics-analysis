Its Going Down Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


What'S hannin' bitch 
Betcha cain't. Do it like me: 
Haha 
Bitch, its Nasty 
Look, 
 
These bitches be frontin', they don't know hustlin' 
Don't, gangbang bitch. I be duckin' 
Outside. With the squad we on beat bussin' 
Investigation, be quiet, say nothin' 
Mobbin' in public. I ain't change, shit! 
 
My teeth and my chain match the gold on my wrist 
Don't rap bout that life. If that ain't, what you live, 
Why you actin' like a child and you far from a kid 
Long nights. In my cell man, I write my own shit. 
Kidnappin hoes, like I'm on some home alone, shit 
I'm, the only V-Nasty like some, never clone shit, 
 
You could crown me the king bitch, I'm on my throne, shit 
Hunnid k in my closet. Double that what I sleep on 
You bitches pawns in the game Ima be on, you could be gone. 
I hope you ready bitch its going down. 
 
Its goin' down its goin' down 
I'm in ya city bitch, its goin' down 
I'm mobbin, I'm I'm ridin'. We slidin' 
And, we slidin' in a bitch, its goin' down 
 
It's goin down its goin down. 
I kill a bitch quick. She want another round, 
I'm up top. She in the ground, 
You say you goin' loud. Well, I don't hear a sound
