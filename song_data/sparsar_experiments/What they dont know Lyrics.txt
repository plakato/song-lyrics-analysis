What they dont know Lyrics
by Unlimited.

Just the other day you was on my back.
Now you in front of ya friends and don't know how to act.
That's okay I ain't want ya thirsty ass an anyway.
Never really was the type to play these little kids games.

But don't front boy.
I mean don't front boy.
We both know what you really want boy.
Don't front don't front don't front.

I bet you didn't tell your little homies.
How you were all in my inbox.
Yeah i got the snapshots.

But don't front boy.
I mean don't front boy.
We both know what you really want boy.
Don't front don't front don't front.

See I have nothing lose.
But maybe something to prove.
But that's up to you.
What you really wanna do oh oh ?
Id advise you to quit the show.
Trust me baby i can stoop real low.

I can take this to a whole other level.
Its like your dancing with the devil.
All the power is in my hands.
Ill promise you i can make you feel less than a man.
Oh man.

So don't front boy.
I mean don't front boy.
I know what you really want boy.
Don't front don't front don't front.
