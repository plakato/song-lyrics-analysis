Loving Strangers Lyrics
by Russian Red.

Ive got a hole in my pocket.
Where all the money has gone.
And Ive got a whole lot of work.
To do with your heart.
Cause its so busy, mines not.

Loving strangers, loving strangers.
Loving strangers, oh.

Its just the start of the winter.
And Im all alone.
And Ive got my eye right on you.
Give me a coin and I'll take you to the moon.
Give me a beer and Ill kiss you so foolishly.
Like you do when you lie, when youre not in my thoughts.
Like you do when you lie and I know its not my imagination.

Loving strangers, loving strangers.
Loving strangers, oh.
