I Am a Poseur Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
Exhibition is the name.
Voyeurism is the game.
Stereoscopic is the show.
Viewing time makes it grow.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
My facade is just a fake.
Shock horror no escape.
Sensationalism for the feed.
Characatures are what you breed.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
Overtones can be betraying.
Establishments like a laugh.
Anti-art was the start.
Yes we're very entertaining.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
I am a poseur and I don't care.
I like to make people stare.
