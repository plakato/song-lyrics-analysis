Gobbler's Knob Lyrics
by Yung Peen & The Sacc.


I'Ve got a better idea: ... No fucking way: 
 
Black, wife, beater bitch, call me Bobby Brown 
Hit your girl every hole. That'S that triple crown 
I'm in my thug's mansion 
Give, your moms, a rug, dancin 
Body counts is Charles Manson 
Bitch. Don'T bring your pants in 
Planet of the Crepes, I'm rollin up for my dinna 
See, you lookin at me, shawty gim me neck. I know you finna 
Got Yeezy's on my feezys 
Fuck, bad bitches and DZ's 
Bitch. You stankin get some febreze 
Face. Your box, like you, was wheaties 
, 
Fuck, yo, clique, fuck, yo, mama, fuck, yo clique, 
This, that shit drop, that ass twerk, that bitch 
 
Twerk 
 
Your bitch on my dick 
I, tried to make her leave. But she love the sacc 
Keep a few side hoes to move my crack 
If. She don't like grapes why she on my vine, 
Like, J, Wilkes Booth. I tote that 9 
Tryna be a butcher, got her hands on my meat 
Run up in your crib. Now your family in the streets, 
Nukka 
 
When I go in, I go hard: 
Comin soon.., Yung, Peen,
