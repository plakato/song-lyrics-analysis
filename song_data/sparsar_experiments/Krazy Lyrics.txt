Krazy Lyrics
by Yung Gleesh.


I-I-I-I-I want the world to go. Krazy 
If I die tonight. I don't want the world to think that I'm krazy 
Krazy krazy 
If I die tonight. I want the world to know. I think that y'all krazy 
 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da dog'em 
Stutter dyslexia, 
Pulled up in the Lexus truck 
Blocks dropping off the top, because I'm special 
Blocks dropping off the top. It'S like it's Tetris, but 
Blocks, going back and forth tryna dodge the federals 
Working with the work I work and come on schedule. 
Say, I'm crazy cause. I say they need let Mike Mike out 
Say, I'm crazy cause. I say they need let Hyde home 
Say, I'm crazy cause. I say they need. Let Lefton go 
Say, I'm crazy cause. I say the same shit for T.O 
Say, I'm crazy cause. I say I miss my man 
God. Damn I really miss my man. 
 
I-I-I-I-I want the world to go. Krazy 
If I die tonight. I don't want the world to think that I'm krazy 
Krazy krazy 
If I die tonight. I want the world to know. I think that y'all krazy 
 
My baby momma had my son outside after it was 10 o'clock. 
I told her'bout that shit before don't have his ass up on my block, 
They say: I'm crazy cause I shot at her, but she didn't get shot. 
They say we crazy cause. We beefing with the niggas down the block. 
Me and Chris was crazy cause we started up and we was loafin' 
Love, my man to death and I ain't never want see him go like Tico 
Mike, Mike crazy cause. I told him that I felt like the folks was watching 
Said that that's movie shit and we had to go, get them blocks. 
When Bo Chris and Zoe hit the goop. I was mad at them. I'M just honest. 
I met my second baby mother on the southside. At the Onyx 
I'm crazy, but I don't like therapy, so I'm gon tell y'all'bout it 
They say I'm crazy, but I told you there is nothing they can say about me. 
 
I-I-I-I-I want the world to go. Krazy 
If I die tonight. I don't want the world to think that I'm krazy 
Krazy krazy 
If I die tonight. I want the world to know. I think that y'all krazy
