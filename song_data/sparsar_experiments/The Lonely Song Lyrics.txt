The Lonely Song Lyrics
by SwaVay.

Uh Uh Right.
La La La la.

By Myself.
Uh Yeah.
I did this here all on my own.
Yeah I did it all alone.
By Myself.
Uh Yeah.
And I ain't never ask for help.
I just did it all myself.
By Myself.
Yeah.
Used to record songs on my phone.
Looking back &amp; now i'm grown.
By myself.
Uh Uh Right.
I swore to God I'd keep it real.
I'm just saying how I feel.
By Myself.
Uh Uh Right.
By Myself.

Daylan told me hit that backboard.
And go dunk that thang myself.
I ain't even signed no contract.
I ain't tryna sit no shelf.
It was just me &amp; my homies.
I ain't need nobody else.
Ain't have to teach me nothing.
Went and did it all myself.
I'm a money motivated.
Almost famous.
Killing savage.
Even though I was adopted.
Ma say I act just like daddy.
I can't stop all this ambition.
Man I'm on a mission.
Been doing this for years.
Look at all the stuff you missing, yeah.
Rolling and whippin.
I'm rolling, I'm rolling and whippin.
I'm swerving and dipping.
Gotta ball like a Piston.
So homie gon play yo position.
Yeah play yo position.
Tryna get back with shawty but baby girl.
She keep on trippin.
Yeah she just keep trippin.
But she gon come back.
Cause she know.
Yeah she know I'm with it.
Yeah she know I'm with it.
Yeah.
While you living get it.
Get it how you live.
Look at me i'm just a kid.
Now i'm bout to get it big.
Even when I wasn't able.
Mind was on me being stable.
Put that money on the table.
&amp; I did it with no label.
By Myself.

Yeah I started from the bottom.
The absolute bottom.
But see that wasn't the problem.
I took a look at my competition and then I got em.
I told put they hands up with my first album.
And then I robbed em.
Flow so sick like what.
Problem.
My words like bullets.
Every single song I shot em.
Going Yonkers in my odd future.
Goblin.
Complaining bout lyricism?
Stop it.
I heard a lot albums this year.
And didn't cop them.
I'm seventeen rapping better than your whole roster.
Never heard a trap song.
Until Waka flocka.
And they saying down south we ain't helping rap nada?
See that's the problem.
Never giving credit where it's really due.
And you wonder why we never play your songs out here.
Plain and simple we ain't really feeling you.
No wonder why I'm killing you.
