A Foggy Day Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do What to do. What to do. 
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets. Alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day. I'Ve known

A foggy day in London, Town
Had me low. Had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm

How long. I wondered: could this thing last 
But the age of miracles, hadn't passed
For? Suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London. Town
The sun was shining everywhere
