Show U Lyrics
by 5th Ward Weebie.

Ms. Tee 
When we met, I thought we were ment to be 
Now. You listening to your friends, you doggin me 
I'm, sitting at home, crying on the phone 
I, don't understand how our love is gone, 
, Why you leavin' me alone ?
 Why you treat me wrong? 
, Just because I made mistakes in the past, 
Doesn't mean our love affair. Cannot last 
 
Chrous 
Luv'en. You is the only way I can show U 
Trust in me, and I will trust you. 
That is all I can wish to 
 
5th Ward Weebie 
 
She had big thighs with nice hair 
Great thong with cute lips 
Everytime that youy see her shes, always wearin nice gear, 
Prada shoes, Prada, pants, 
Come on girl. Let'S see you dance 
Bend over and touch the floor, 
Pull it down and show me more

Truing, to be my ol' lady trying to keep a playa around

Catchin' the floor? Wit it and shakin your trunk baby, 
Popin off my song, takin off your thong
