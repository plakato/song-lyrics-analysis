Show U Lyrics
by 5th Ward Weebie.

Ms. Tee.
When we met I thought we were ment to be.
Now you listening to your friends, you doggin me.
I'm sitting at home crying on the phone.
I don't understand how our love is gone.
Why you leavin' me alone.
Why you treat me wrong.
Just because I made mistakes in the past.
Doesn't mean our love affair can not last.

Chrous.
Luv'en you  is the only way I can show U.
Trust in me and I will trust you.
That is all I can wish to.

5th Ward Weebie.

She had big thighs with nice hair.
Great thong with cute lips.
Everytime that youy see her shes always wearin nice gear.
Prada shoes Prada pants.
Come on girl let's see you dance.
Bend over and touch the floor.
Pull it down and show me more.
Have you ever heard of me.
Tearin' it down wit Ms. Tee.
Spell it for me please girl.
W-E-E-B-I-E.
No baby what you think this here is funny.
Takin yo clothes off trying to get to Weebie money.
Ah ha baby you gotta break it off propa.
You gotta do a little bit more than give fifty and prauda.
I really don't want yo prauda ain't trying to be settled down.
Truing to be my ol' lady trying to keep a playa around.

5th Ward Weebie.

Look I'm Lil' Weebie.
You can say what you want baby.
Catchin' the floor wit it, and shakin your trunk baby.
Popin off my song, takin off your thong.
If you don't belong, get your coat go home.
Cauz I heard you was a nasty freakin for Weebie.
I like to shake it and take it, I like the money you make it.
Now turn around, tear it down, shake your leg wit it.
The way you move it and do it your hurtin' my head wit it.
I'm a dog baby, lord somebody tell this girl.
I hit 'em duck 'em and treat 'em just like that other girl.
Now just hold on cousin bustin and workin on my nerves.
You bout to make me go off and kick you to the curb.

*Talking*.
Ms. Tee.
I don't really know if you trust in me.
baby you gotta believe me  baby I love you.
