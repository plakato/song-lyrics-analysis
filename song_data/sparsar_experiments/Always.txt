Always
by Volbeat.

Sickness hide inside.

Eating flesh by time.
The saddest news I have in mind.
But I know you man.
A heart like no one else.
Keeps the fire glow friend.

If I loose you, with the smile you do.
If I loose you, in the morning.
In the final sleep.
If I lose you.

Only one to know.
And I promise you.
Nothing change unless you say.
But I know you man.
A heart like no one else.
Keeps the fire glow my friend.

Carry on cause there's no place to hide.
Find the oath and feel.
Our love for you is for all endless time.
Alone you never be.
