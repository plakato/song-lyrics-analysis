Holla Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


Whoop Whoop.
Whoop Whoop.
Whoop Whoop.
Holla Whoop Whoop Holla Whoop Whoop.

Master P.
Call me the trash man cause I put it up in bags.
Whodi owe me money, I'mma bust his fuckin' ass.
I'm allergic to Dr. Pepper so pass the Dr. Fishner.
Hit me on the 2Way whodi I get witcha.
Put in on the stove bake it like a pie.
Take it to the hood slang it for 16-5.
When niggas snortin' that boy they be passin' that girl.
Wrap it up in ziplock, bag it up as furl.
Send money to the pen, Mac &amp; C be home soon.
Bitches start snitchin' I'mma send 'em to the moon.
I can sell a ho a dream, front a hustla weight.
I could never fall off I'm the GHETTO BILL GATES!!

Curren$y.
These little niggas can't take it anymore.
I push thru the club iced out low key wit my P.Miller velour.
Hoes breakin' down the doors uhn.
Because the 504 Boyz here, they can't wait til' we get on.
It's Curren$y the muthafuckin' rookie of the year.
This ain't the WNBA ain't no pussy's over here.
Yeah I'm makin' figgas fuckin' wit the Ghetto Bill.
In a truck wit some rims that's bigger than ferris wheels holla.

Krazy.
See this No Limit Army nigga, that's my click.
See the ho that you tongue kissin' use to be my bitch.
See these thangs that I'm slangin' nigga, they call bricks.
An this brown shit I'm sniffin' nigga, it got me sick.
An this big truck I'm pushin' nigga, my tight whip.
Wit a chopper layin' on the seat, that'll make you flip.
My alias believe me Doc Holiday.
If it's beef, I'm like aids I never go away.

Master P.
I might let somethin' slide but I won't forget.
Tell Double XL they could suck my dick.
I might be country but I'm ghetto rich.
An when it comes to grindin' I started this shit.
I put the G in ghetto nigga call me ghetto fab.
Started wit some quarters then I flipped it to some halves.
Put the coke in Coca Cola, no bakin' soda.
Call me Pistol P cause I slang them granolas.

T-Bo.
Bitch them thangs just got dropped off, the blocks hot like hot sauce.
So puff puff keep passin' &amp; I promise yall they not lost.
Convicted felons load your weapons, they tryna knock ya top off.
For braggin' to them hatin' bitches bout how much your watch cost.
Loose lips sank ships bitch so watch what you sayin'.
It's the New No Limit baby they got us under survelance.
An the Feds ain't playin' they kickin' down doors daily.
Ain't this a bitch I just got off probation.

Magic.
I'm tryna get me a whole chicken, chop it down into dimes.
Then flip that bitch quicker than I can flip these rhymes.
Now I'm on two birds I'mma flip one more time.
An I'm on top done left you bitch niggas behind.
I'm grindin' I'm hustlin', don't trust me when I'm broke.
An I don't discrimanate I want the money &amp; the dope.
You better hope I wear a mask out or things'll get bloody.
Four to ya tummy real messy &amp; ugly.

Master P.
If you east coast thuggin' holla {Whoop Whoop}.
If you west coast thuggin' holla {Whoop Whoop}.
If you midwest thuggin' holla {Whoop Whoop}.
If you down south hustlin' holla {whoop whoop}.
