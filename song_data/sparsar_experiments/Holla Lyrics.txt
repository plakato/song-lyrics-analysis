 Whoop Whoop 
 Whoop Whoop, 
, Whoop, Whoop, 
Holla, Whoop, Whoop, Holla, Whoop, Whoop, 
, 
Master, P. 
Call me the trash man cause, I put it up in bags. 
Whodi owe me money I'mma bust, his fuckin' ass, 
I'm, allergic to Dr. Pepper, so pass the Dr. Fishner 
Hit me on the 2Way whodi I get witcha 
Put in on the stove bake. It like a pie 
Take it to the hood slang it for 16-5 
When niggas snortin' that boy they be passin' that girl 
Wrap it up in ziplock bag, it up as furl 
Send money to the pen, Mac
