Heavenly Moment Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


January child goes wild for.
Irish eyes that smile, they'll blind you.
Now he's 21, a high youth.
Now there's something wrong, he's high through.

It don't matter it's my birthday on the way.
But every bass line in the world is in my head.
And I'm frightened of the worst day on the way.

Ooh, Hey!
I know where this story belongs.
Ooh, Hey!
I know where this story can last.

January child goes wild for.
Irish eyes that smile, they'll find you.
Now he's 21, a high youth.
Now there's nothing wrong, he's found you.

You're not gonna go insane.
Was the most beautiful thing anyone has said to me.
Radicalise me, something's changed in the way.
I feel strangely calm in the most bizarre way.

Ooh, Hey!
I know where this story can last.
Ooh, Hey!
I know where this story belongs.

My love is honest as stone.
My love is honest as stone.
My love is honest as stone.
I said my love is honest as stone.
