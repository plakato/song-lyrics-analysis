I Want to Know Lyrics
by Tyler Joseph.

And I, I tried to sing for you.
I tried to live for you.
I tried to keep the truth.
Oh yeah, I, I failed to sing for you.
I failed to live for you.
I failed to keep the truth.

I want to know.

I want to see.

I want to be with you when I am weak.

Because the only reason why you think his life is clear.
Is because he knows that he will never understand).

I tried to sing for you.
I tried to live for you.
I tried to keep the truth.
But I failed to sing for you.
I failed to live for you.

I want to know.
I want to see.
I want to be with you.
When I am weak.

I want to know.

I want to see.

I want to be with you when I am weak.

Again? Sure.

I want to know.
I want to see.
I want to be with you.
When I am weak.
