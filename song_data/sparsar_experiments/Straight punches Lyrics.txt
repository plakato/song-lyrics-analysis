Straight punches Lyrics
by Punsy.


I got the heart of Rosa Parks, refuse to sit in the back
I stand out like a paragraph. That'S written in caps
I am everything you crave. No checking the menu
Spitting power bars that's hard to digest like the gym food
Spitting complex schemes like ocean's eleven
I'm, so above y'all I drop down to go into heaven
I'm, bringing you the facts like news with live coverage
But My bars go over your heads like flight luggage
Got, the people Feeling me like they're reading in braile
Me and rap go together like beaches and pales
I love Hip Hop. It has a place in my soul
It's, like stealing from a castle, how I'm taking the throne

Bringing energy like iron man's power. Inhibitor
Just, look at all the haters they're as sour as vinegar
How. You gon na go gold when your style's irrelevant 
You're more like pyrite, so you're out of your element
My aura, blinds guys you when it passes through the eyes
You, should cry ... Cuz. You would lose a battle to a mime
Far ahead in this race, I'm in another time. Zone
Not, regional, I'm talking'bout a quantum time, zone
Taking rap against her will like a lifetime movie
While I'm eating emcees like it's mai, tai sushi
Keep, your space from me. Please, like I'm playing the wii
Cuz, I'm stomping dudes out and they're, just taking defeat

I'm, so lyrical and swell ripley doesn't believe. It
I am biblical in scale. It'S like I'm cousins with jesus

I got the mind of einstein. These words come from a genius
 ..., i'm so fly. I can skip on a nimbus
Corporate dad to these rappers i'mma give'em, the business
I'm, a circus act, performance you're, just sitting, awe
The music. It feels so good like a trip to spa
I'm like an ipod for christmas cuz, I'm gifted with music
I'll. Make you put your hands together. Like you did a hadoken
In control, you're the slaves. Now they callin' me, masta
Bars are cold like buying alcohol in alaska
