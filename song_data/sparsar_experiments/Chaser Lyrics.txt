Chaser Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

When you clear out all the smoke, the memories of those years.
Seem dimly lit like I never replaced a light bulb.
When you clear out all the smoke, they found me on your neighbor's lawn.
Rambling on, dizzy and upset and freezing cold.
But I know how it looked when I fell to pieces around you.

I'm a chaser but I found stronger winds.
If you believe her, there's no going home again.
I'm a chaser, I found stronger winds.
If you believe her, there's no going home.
I'm not going home, I got suckered in.

Please, don't make me feel like a disaster.
I'm learning how to put the pieces back together.
And turn the aching to composure.
I'm thinking with my head first;.
No more broken phones or swollen knuckles.
From putting holes in the booth by the back wall.

When you clear out all the smoke, I guess everyone's alone.
When you clear out all the smoke, I don't see why that's so wrong.
