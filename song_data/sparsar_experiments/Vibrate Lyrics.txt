Vibrate Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

My phone's on vibrate for you
Electroclash is karaoke. Too
I, try to dance Britney, Spears
I! Guess I'm getting on in years

My phone's on vibrate for you
God knows what all these new drugs do
I guess to have no more fears
But. Still. I always end up in tears

My phone's on vibrate for you
But. Still, I never ever feel from you
Pinocchio's. Now a boy
Who wants to turn back into a toy

So call. Me
Call me in the morning
Call me in the night
So call me
Call me anytime, you like

My phone's on vibrate for you
For you
