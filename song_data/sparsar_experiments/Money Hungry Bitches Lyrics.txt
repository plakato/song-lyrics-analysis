Money Hungry Bitches Lyrics
by Yung 69 & 0ld 420.


I seent a money hungry bitch just the other day.
She asked me for this sunny d i told her go away.
Smoked 420 pounds of OG qush cuz my name's 0ld 420.
Then I had to get some food cuz that shit makes me hungry.
Chillen in the grocery store eatin' all the carrots.
So I can always tell when these bitches after my carats.
Dining at the shittiest restaurants cuz it's fun.
Especially when I bring your mom then clap those buns.
Hamburger of course, gotta wine and dine her 'fore i fuck her.
Got the Franzia on deck, or some shit I spent 5 bucks for.
If she thinks she's getting money from me then she be trippin'.
Eat a 10 pound lobster while she be strippin'.
I only spend stacks on me and my dude Yung 69.
But I might throw 10 mil in the strip club just for the vine.
Cookin' some shit in a pot, it might be mayo.
Got your mom on her knees while I'm whipping yayo.

Pussy in my mouth like i was eating a trout.
But then I see my bitch is starting to pout.
I'm like yo bitch what is this about.
She said you ain't putting enough in my bank account.
I got like 69 grams of the kuch.
Bitches ain't even shaving their bush.
Me and 0ld 420 literally tag team em all day.
And then smack em if they ask for pay.
Your girl call me Slick Rick after I send her this dick pic.
But I won't ever fall for a trick bitch.
I make that real hip hop.
Every time you rap the bitches say stop!
Yung 69 used to move that dope all day.
Now he just chill in southern L.A.
I just buy her a drink and then she gon wink.
We laughing at how you're broke like Lil Flip.
