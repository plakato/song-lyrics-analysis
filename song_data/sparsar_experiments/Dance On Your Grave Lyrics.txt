Dance On Your Grave Lyrics
by Ruse.

I never thought you'd kiss and tell.
You said you'd take it to your grave.
You got us all under your spell.
I bet you thought you had it made.
Oh oh oh thought that I could take it.
Oh oh oh Never thought you faked it.
Oh oh oh you had to go and spread it?
Oh oh oh now I know where you are headed.
I'm gonna dance on your grave.
Because the dead can't talk.
The dead can't talk.
Don't mention the war.
And the war won't stop.
The war won't stop.
I'm gonna watch you sink or swim.
Tie bricks onto your heels.
I guess it's better you than me.
I'm gonna watch you take the heat.
Oh oh oh thought that I could take it.
Oh oh oh Never thought you faked it.
Oh oh oh you had to go and spread it?
Oh oh oh now I know where you are headed.
I'm gonna dance on your grave.
Because the dead can't talk.
The dead can't talk.
Don't mention the war.
And the war won't stop.
The war won't stop.
