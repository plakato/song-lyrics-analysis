Broken Circuit Lyrics
by The World Alive.

Look into my eyes.

Why the fuck did you think I'd just take it?
All the things you said to break me, I faked it!
All I have to say.
I don't know you.
And you don't know what I've been through.

Not enough, they always told me.
I'm no one, I never will be.
They were wrong, don't ever listen.
They are wrong.

When everyone thinks you You've had enough!
It's your turn, you can't give in.
Just remember to shout I won't give up.
I won't give up!

Did you think I'd just lay down and die.
My rule's an eye for an eye.
I can't believe you thought I'd listen to you.
I've made mistakes but I'm no fool.

Instrumental.

I know why.
You always feel weak it's too hard to fight.
I see why.
But it's now or never take back your life.

It's a fight. Are you with me?
Taking back our lives.
From the thieves who've robbed our minds.
It's a fight. I'm taking back what's rightfully mine.
It's a fight. No escape, no regrets.
I'm not giving up this time.

Take back your LIFE!
