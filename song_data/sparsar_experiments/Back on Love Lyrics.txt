Back on Love Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


Lately, ain't got a clue what I going through.
Every time you walk away.
I guess it's my fault cause.
But no matter what you do.
I let you come back anyway.

I blame it all on fantasy.
Mistaken lies for chemistry.
Ain't got a choice but to let you walk.
Cause nothing was what I thought.

I thought that we was in love.
And you were the one.
And you'd have my back down for anything.
Stick with me through the joy and the pain.
How could you turn your back on us.

I was so madly in love.
I know it got rough.
Never questioned what was left for us to save.
None left in my heart for you to break.
How could you turn your back on love.

I was stuck in love alone.
Cause you went and switched up the role.
Run away with my heart.
No, I don't hear it beating.
Somebody call 911.

My world just stopped.
And I can't breathe.
Tryna act real tough.
But you know I'm hurting.
I just gotta give it up.
All my loving didn't mean much.
