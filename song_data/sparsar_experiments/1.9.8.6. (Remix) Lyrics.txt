1.9.8.6. (Remix) Lyrics
by Sway.

Ill Advised.
What, too many thugs on mic's, bought to show ya niggas.
Lightnin strikes, in the same place twice.
Put on my game face like Rice, till my name in lights.
Pain and price, game tight, put this train in flight.
The baby black catalyst, wanna battle this, miraculous.
Flow, like Jesus chain watered the wine and marriages.
Averages sixty points a game, on point like cactuses.
Flippin the spatulas, on all ya wack rap amateurs.
What, don't even step in my circumference, we dump shit.
Pump it, 30/30 til ya pump doin gun clips.
The gun clips spit the verbal, once flip.
Cause a few to rise, do the styles, that's on some shit.
Sware to God, on my unborn, I be the one on.
Ninety three million miles away, stars kept the sun warm.
Sizzlin, fuck the Jews grizzlin, Crystal's Christenin.
I'm dissin em, they ain't spittin it, we ain't listenin.
They vision been blurred, can't recall when occurred.
When herb made words, we verbin thirty-third to third.
Fuck what you heard, who preferred? Fly's or bird?
Wit the nerve to serve emcees to the stage to the curb.
Leave no witnesses, no clues to rip this shit.
Baby black wit the gift to spit ridiculous.
West Philly streets to Brooklyn, on Saint Nicholas.
Who number one when I hit ya list.

Rasheed.
Who number one, have the squads ever tied toe, tied toe.
Other crew them other tied toe, tied toe.
So them other emcee, tied toe, tied toe.
Illaphilf, we outta nitro, what, what, what.
We outta dung-dung-di-dung-dung, diggy-dung-dung, diggy-di.
Diggy-dung-dung, diggy-dung-dung, diggy-dung-dung, diggy-di.
Remember the name of the crew, if they gonna be phifey.
Remember the name of the crew, they call a.

Black Thought.
Yo down by a law, you must be talkin bout me.
It's the B-L-A-C-K, T-H-O-U-G-H-T.
By these schooly crowd niggas, show them how to emcee.
Ya I'm sayin, representin, we comin outta SP.
Check it out, we take you a stab lower, approach closer.
Hold it down to the utmost, my mic toast ya.
Illa-Fifth, illa vibe, illadel adrenaline.
Sound waves leavin you tremblin, as we begin again.

Malik B.
Aiyo, I'm tryin to get this cash in abundance.
Redundantly, I represent the rugged done D.
The crack cost money, but yo the try's free.
I wack a MC, for tent out or step me.
Now test me, give you a once or compin the swine.
Dump you wit the fifth emblem, leave ya niggas tremblin.
Then ya realize, the kiss of death pull up in 'em.
To minimize ya half ass freeze, you wack ass leaves.
My rap leaves a thug full of poisonous back feeds.
Test ya whole attire, empire on fire.
I strike right back, sick, or ya might not clap.
We get the whole round of applause, son get the jaws.

From the South to the West.
To the East to the North.
To, if, find la son, the land of the lost.
Go off, disturbin order, 5 mics in The Source.
Queens City, Roots Crew, it's yours....
