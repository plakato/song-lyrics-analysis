95 like dat - remix Lyrics
by Tyga.

95 like dat.
95 like dat.
95 like dat.
95.
95 stylin, straight shots, gold medallion.
Put your number on this paper, promise I'mma dial it.
Cute college chick, daddy was a doctor.
Word to the great Vonn, she datin a rapper.
Entertainer, athlete, she never after.
So I entertain her late night well after.
High 10 after, midnight his bedtime.
You could say I stole a heart, I just call it face time.
No rush, just relax your mind.
You are now listening to sounds of a better rap.
Bands in drop, there's mosh pit in the lobby.
Girl so horny, that's my type of party.
No ties, mob shits, suits and ties.
Crap table, Vegas, vampire nights.
I marry you tonight just to say we did it right.
Waking up with regrets, roll over.
She be like: Why you never called me back?
Sometimes you just be like that.
Can't promise the world but I could promise you half of that.
Sometimes you just be like that.
All the rumors you heard, I ain't got no time for that.
Shit, I ain't got no time for that.
And you ain't gotta cry, dry your eyes, we gon get through that.
Trust we gon get through that.
95 like dat.
Reservations, call, serve a table.
Alligator, snake skin, purple label.
Polyester, black berretta, who do it better.
For my niggas caged up writing them letters.
Lower level, reporting live, channel 11.
No emergency but I'm in the 9/11.
Far settle, girl scream, a red fellow.
Pull up on the scene, bumping on the instrumental.
And you know it, know it.
Time flies when you're flying first class all the time.
And you know it, know it.
No time for the games, dollar signs on my mind.
And you know it, know it.
Eye for an eye, young killa, just wanna stay alive.
And you know it, know it.
Gotta learn to live with regrets, I regret the times.
You like: Why you never called me back?
Sometimes you just be like that.
Can't promise the world but I could promise you half of that.
Sometimes you just be like that.
All the rumors you heard, I ain't got no time for that.
Shit, I ain't got no time for that.
And you ain't gotta cry, dry your eyes, we gon get through that.
Trust we gon get through that.
95 like dat.
95 like dat.
95 like dat.
95 like dat.
Litigations, black faces, lawyers, briefcases.
Agent, top notch, paid investigations.
Fired, off top, block shots Anthony Davis.
Rod the greatest, acres, no neighbors.
Do that so many times, hope you do better next time.
Think about a dog next time you drop a dime.
Better ride, so she rather fly.
Always aksing me the same thing all the time.
Why you never called me back?
Sometimes you just be like that.
Can't promise the world but I could promise you half of that.
Sometimes you just be like that.
All the rumors you heard, I ain't got no time for that.
Shit, I ain't got no time for that.
And you ain't gotta cry, dry your eyes, we gon get through that.
Trust we gon get through that.
95 like dat.
