In The Quiet Dawn Lyrics
by Wolverine.

All these changes I've been wanting.
Greet my morning and I'm thinking.
Am I a blessed one? How did I get this far?
Could it be that I'm a changed man and that I'm finally breaking free?
Free from all of my illusions that I would never be enough.
Could it be that I'm just fine the way I've always been?
Could it be that I'm alright despite the flaws that I've seen and lived…
I've been hiding for a lifetime.
Never wanted to be found but.
Somehow I dared to be more than I thought I was.
The life I lived in silence was my padded prison cell.
I would never find a way back as far as I could tell.
It was all so still… I was all so still…
I remember how I stumbled towards.
A tranquil fate of living by the will of others.
I waited for something much more…
I waited for something much more…
I waited for something much more…
Don't live afraid… Don't live ashamed…
Don't live in wait… The road is yours to walk…
