Feels So Real Lyrics
by Rusko.

Yeah.
You make me feel so real.
Yeah.
You make me feel so real..
When I'm on my own, I feel so alone.
You've got the love I've never known.
I feel for you now baby, when the lights go down.
I feel for you now baby, when you're not around.
The way you make me feel, you make me feel so real.
You make me feel so real..
Feel so good..
Yeah.
You make me feel so real.
We pick up the pace a little bit.
Cause you better know I still feel?
You make me feel so real.
When I'm on my own, I feel so alone.
You've got the love I've never known.
I feel for you now baby, when the lights go down.
I feel for you now baby, when you're not around.
The way you make me feel, you make me feel so real.
You make me feel so real..
Feel so good..
The way you make me feel, you make me feel so real. You make me feel so real..
