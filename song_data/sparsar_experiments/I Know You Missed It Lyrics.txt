I Know You Missed It Lyrics
by The World Famous Tony Williams.

The World Famous Tony Williams.
She said she 'bout to get engaged to.
Some old boy she knew from grade school.
Then she sayin' I ain't done her right.
She might be right.
She says I ain't feelin' emotions.
They're like finding pearls in the ocean.
She ?
But I know that in her heart.

I know you missed it.
I know you missed it.
I know you missed it, baby.
I know you miss this love.

The World Famous Tony Williams.
You can run, you can leave, don't leave us.
What would it all prove.
You can talk to all your friends about the things that I do.
Stick around I know we can go be what.
We can be lovely, you gotta walk in my shoes.
That's what I know about you.
Yeah, I guess some things you should've learned back in grade school.
She said I never played by the rules.
Nowadays you know I'm feelin' like.
She might be right.
Nowadays we're tryin' new potions.
Never askin' what have we chosen.
Swear some day I'm gonna get it right.
I swear some day I'm gonna get it right.

The World Famous Tony Williams.
Now you can run and you can leave, please don't leave us.
What would it all prove.
You can talk to all your friends about the things that I do.
But you're my Cherry o, my suga Cherry o wine.
Cherry o, Lord what are you?
You're OH MY GOD!!
