Blossom Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Without anyone to love you.
What will you blossom into?
Without anyone to hold you.
How will you grow?
And in the Wildwood trees.
The wild wind blows.
And the nighttime crushes the hurricane rose.
And with no one to care for you.
Who knows.
Blossom for me rose.
You're the picture of my love.
Blossom for me rose.
Stretch out underneath the stars.
And when tomorrow comes.
I will hold you up.
Little blossom, shining in the sun.
Without any place to go to.
How will your soul return to.
Without anyone to keep you.

Where will you go.
And in the shadows of the past.
Where you're spinning so fast.
It's hard to see it coming.
And it never lasts.
And with nothing to judge your life by.
How will you know.
Blossom for me rose.
You're the picture of my life.
Blossom for me rose.
Stretch out underneath the stars.
And when tomorrow comes.
I will hold you up.
Little blossom, shining in the sun.
Without anyone to love you.
What will you blossom into.
Without anyone to hold you.
How will you grow.
