Boy Witch Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

If he was a girl could she be as evil as a boy.
Would she scramble in the dark for his eyes.

If she finds that his eyes give out nothing that she likes.
Like a candle in the dark she makes light.

He is in love with a girl in her cold void.

Make him shout.
