Oval Office Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

This recording is a collection, 
Of unintended indiscretions before a microphone 
 
Oh who locked the door 
A hard. Man is good to find. 
Open the door 
The principles.. of friction, 
 
Nice, This feeling's a function so step to this 
Serch Ain't. The average boys who do this 
Nice Door is opened to office, summoned 
Serch, Yo Pete. I think you're in there man 
Nice Reception, warm, not a handshake 

Serch. She was seated legs long and slammin 
Nice Oval office opened. So let's begin 
Push my point across firmly 
Serch Core proposal. 
Nice Prime Minister serve me. Surely 
I serve you with motion. 
And doors, open wider coast in 
Serch Secretary said: Put Serch on line two.. 
Yo put him on hold 
 
That. Towel was related to my husband, 
 
* MC Serch speaking in background * 
Aiyyo Pete man. Let me in man 
I'm here to get retarded yo so step off. 
Nah, I'm not holdin the door to come in 
Yo yo move your move, your elbow 
Move, your elbow yo you're, not dickin! On me, 
Your boy, look like the Great Pumpkin 
You're frontin, like you play the Pumpkin 
Move your elbow because I'm IN THERE 
 
Serch The meeting rotates 
Nice, Mockneck or cactus 
They got my head. Boss.. 
BOTH. She attacked us 
Nice With a treaty for disarmament. 
Serch. We signed 
Nice Figured there's no harm in it. 
So I disarmed 
Serch And I poured the Scotch 
And asked the Prime Minister mind. If I watch 
 
Nice Yeah, I reckon 
You keep minutes I'll. Let you get seconds 
Then. The summit rose, I get vetoed, 
Presidential pardon. Let me G yo 
Serch Lunch became filet of soul/sole with tongue 
Nice. The Oval Office work is never done, 
Serch Never done. 
 
That towel was related to my husband, 
 
* MC Serch, Pete, Nice speaking in background * 
Aiyyo, I'm serious man did you have sex 
Nah man 
It was you that did it 
Filet of sole on the Oval Office 
On a peanut butter leg, 
Yo.. 
She got Down to my knees and it spread, 
 
That towel was related to my husband, 
 
Nice G'in seein. Have you playin it like a diplomat, 
The Oval Office, ain't nothin, but a boot magnet 
Serch Close to close, but Pete freaked it anyway, 
Nice Serch said 
Serch, Prime. Let'S do the three the hard way 
Nice And knockin like we're. Knockin 
Serch BOOTS 
The office flooded with the sex check, suits 
Deploy missiles of the MX variety 
Nice Spoken spasm of invasion. Inside of me 
Serch, I release my rebels. The onslaught ceased: 
* woman moaning, uhhh, uhhh uhhh, uhhh, * 
And in the Oval Office 
Nice. Finally, peace 
Motions carried out played it like Presidents 
Serch. What'S the Oval Office 
Nice Our permanent residence 
Serch Meeting of the mind, as well as the pelvis 
Nice Aiyyo Bush 
Serch. We'Re outtie, like Elvis, 
 
Aiyyo, Serch you're in there man 
You're. Finally, in there, for the first time, man 
Victims of these classic boners..
