Oval Office Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

This recording, is a collection.
Of unintended indiscretions before a microphone.

Oh who locked the door?
A hard man is good to find..
Open the door!
The principles.. of friction.

Nice This feeling's a function, so step to this.
Serch Ain't the average boys who do this.
Nice Door is opened, to office summoned.
Serch Yo Pete I think you're in there man!
Nice Reception warm, not a handshake.

Serch She was seated, legs long and slammin.
Nice Oval office opened, so let's begin!
Push my point across, firmly.
Serch Core proposal.
Nice Prime Minister serve me, surely.
I serve you with motion.
And doors open wider, coast in.
Serch Secretary said, Put Serch on line two...
Yo, put him on hold!

That towel was related to my husband!

* MC Serch - speaking in background *.
Aiyyo Pete man, let me in man.
I'm here to get retarded yo, so step off.
Nah I'm not holdin the door to come in.
Yo, yo move your, move your elbow!
Move your elbow, yo, you're not dickin on me.
Your boy look like the Great Pumpkin.
You're frontin like you play the Pumpkin.
Move your elbow, because I'm IN THERE!

Serch The meeting rotates.
Nice Mockneck or cactus?
They got my head boss...
BOTH She attacked us!
Nice With a treaty for disarmament.
Serch We signed.
Nice Figured there's no harm in it.
So I disarmed.
Serch And I poured the Scotch.
And asked the Prime Minister, mind if I watch?

Nice Yeah, I reckon.
You keep minutes, I'll let you get seconds.
Then the summit rose, I get vetoed.
Presidential pardon, let me G yo!
Serch Lunch became filet of soul/sole with tongue.
Nice The Oval Office work is never done!
Serch Never done!

That towel was related to my husband!

* MC Serch - Pete Nice speaking in background *.
Aiyyo I'm serious man, did you have sex?
Nah man.
It was you that did it!
Filet of sole on the Oval Office.
On a peanut butter leg.
Yo...
She got down to my knees and it spread!

That towel was related to my husband!

Nice G'in, seein, have you playin it like a diplomat.
The Oval Office ain't nothin but a boot magnet.
Serch Close to close, but Pete freaked it anyway.
Nice Serch said.
Serch Prime, let's do the three the hard way!
Nice And knockin like we're knockin.
Serch BOOTS!
The office flooded with the sex check suits.
Deploy missiles of the MX variety.
Nice Spoken spasm of invasion inside of me.
Serch I release my rebels, the onslaught ceased.
* woman moaning uhhh, uhhh, uhhh, uhhh *.
And in the Oval Office.
Nice Finally peace!
Motions carried out, played it like Presidents.
Serch What's the Oval Office?
Nice Our permanent residence!
Serch Meeting of the mind, as well as the pelvis.
Nice Aiyyo Bush!
Serch We're outtie like Elvis!

Aiyyo Serch you're in there man.
You're finally in there, for the first time man!
Victims of these classic boners...
Yo move that thick body of yours.
Move that thick white body!
Victims of these classic boners...

MC Serch.
Yes, yes -- WOOOOOODIEE!
I've got the woody!
I've got the woodie -- and I'm gonna get the head.
Victims of these classic boners...
I can feel it! You gotta understand see.
Victims of these classic boners...
Gotta understand the subject of the topic.
There's too much butt-waxin, no --.
There's too much vaseline usage.
There's too much KY jelly.
Cause I've got the WOOOOODIEE!
I have the woody man, I have.
Yo let me tell you somethin man, you're a GIRLIE MAN.
You're a flabber man, I am a muscle man.
I think you are my auntie.
Cause I am the man who is in the Oval Office.
You're just a GIRLIE FLABBER MAN, you hamster man.
I'm a great man, you're a flabber man.

Uhh, aiyyo yo you know what I heard?
I heard Rob never got the wood.
I heard Rob is frontin like the Great Pumpin on the woodie.
And I heard Seth Lover? He got the WRONG woodie.
He needs the positive... WOOOODIEEEE!
Aiyyo I'm goin home man; I'm goin home to tell my mother.
I'm goin home to tell my mother about my first experience.. *fades*.
