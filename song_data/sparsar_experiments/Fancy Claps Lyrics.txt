Fancy Claps Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

I'll be home when hair has fallen out.
We'll be home when it reaches the ground.
We'll be home, we'll be home then.
We can sing, two cracks in the crossbeams.
We can sing very, very quietly.
We can sing, we can sing for each other.

Until then don't tear your hair out.
I won't tear it out if you don't.

When I die, I'm leaving you my feet.
When you die, you can stand up for me.
We can lie in a homemade canoe.
You can put me in your hair, I'll be happy there.

Oh oh.
Oh oh.
Oh oh.

We'll be home when my hair has fallen out.
We'll be home when we've picked it up off the ground.
We'll be home then, we'll be home then.
We can sing and we'll be home then.
