Allusions Lyrics
by The Underachievers.


Gee, young nigga but my heart is timeless.
No price on my soul, ship filled up with gold.
Mothafucka y'know that's priceless.
2 grams ain't enough, nigga keep yo blunt.
Won't smoke if the shit ain't the finest.
Niggas talk about what they got.
When you check on these niggas, motherfuckers be lying.
Bow down to the motherfucking highness.
Fire start Hibachi,.
nigga OG like Hiachi.
Break up yo whole posse, ya'll niggas movin' too sloppy.
Hittin' like I'm Rocky, independent you can't drop me.
Beast Coast be my army if I tell 'em shoot, they got me.
Raised in the belly of the beast.
Born in a war but my heart with the peace.
Raising up Gods every time that I speak.
When we all get involved ain't no starvin' to eat.
Making sure all my niggas gon' feast.
Ya'll gonna see why we chasing the cream.
Roll up the leaves, nigga spark up the tree.
You ain't got no weed?
Nigga fuck you mean.
Nigga fuck you mean.

Ak The Savior.
My aura gold, word to the oracle.
I'm the illest motherfucker incurable.
I went through all the bull, about a toilet full.
In royal flesh, I want all the loot man.
The sour be clutch like Kobe do.
And I'm living in L.A. so that's only proof.
Got a bitch in the bay, that love the shroom.
She be screaming AK! when I shove the broom.
It's a mismatch, can't hold us.
Better get back, you ain't no soldier.
Fuck your sister, guess what she told us.
You a bitch ass nigga since stroller, now hol' up.
Smoking good, 'fronto wrapped around the OG in my hood.
It's understood, if AK be winning then you know you could.
Psych! bitch can't kill my vibe, I'm on an everlasting high.
Want peace of mind and piece of pie.
If it's not both then take my life.
I'm blowing smoke until I die, high as heaven watch me fly.
Look within you'll probably find a place.
Go home boy live yo life.

I'm blowing gas smoke, fuck up my cash flow.
Fuck it lets waste it.
We advance though, even your fans know.
Ya'll niggas basic.
Smoking hash bowls, we lit like candles.
Nigga stay faded.
You and yo mans jokes, we with yo damn hoe.
Them bitches wasted.

Peso, I'm counting peso's and smoking fuego.
Save hoes, you niggas save hoes, now that's a no-go.
Photo, she sneaking photo, she think she low tho.
Soul gold, she think my soul gold, think we should hang tho.

I'm smoking mad dope, she sniffin' mad blow.
I'm like you bad hoe, now fast forward.
She took her pants off, guess she like assholes.
Gang coast be counting mad dough with no advance though.
My cash flow, fuck up a damn show then take a fan home.
Fuego, fuego, smoking fuego with yo dame.
Been like a whole 20 minutes, can't front.
Nigga still don't know her name.
30 minutes later have my pinky in her brain.
She like, I thought you were different?
All of you rappers just the same.
She ain't complain.

AK The Savior.
AK inside of your bitch, right in the bunk ain't no need for no crib.
Light up the skunk and then pro-ceed to go in.
Like a nitrogen pump, top the speed off like damn.
Pray this new shit make your speaker blow.
Puffin' khalifa dro, make your girl tippy-toe in.
She in love then she go telling her friends.
Like she hitting my line cause the lord is on tour yet again.
Wait for a nigga to start winning.
First they love you then they hate, then they tasting the salt.
Face it you niggas is soft, Krillin.
Know the knowledge ain't hidden just open the vault.
No debating, stay dope inhaling.
Clear the road, no trailing.
Never sober, steering.
Get run over near me.
Dropping cold shit yearly.
Flow severely, I know.
you feel me.
