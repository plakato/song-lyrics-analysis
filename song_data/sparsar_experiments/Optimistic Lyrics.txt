Optimistic Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

He was feeling optimistic.
His heart was tickin' click tick tick.
Synthetic hopes of a different day.
Sparks flew across his wings.

The stars are shining from a light engine.
The DJ is spinning wig, wig, wig.
Color vision with a blurry view.
That's life if he just knew.

His life becomes worth living.
When he is dreaming, while he sleeps.
His life becomes worth living.
When he is dreaming while he sleeps.

Monday morning the lights are on.
Monday morning his life is gone.
The world is turning dark again.
His fellow workers are alive again.
