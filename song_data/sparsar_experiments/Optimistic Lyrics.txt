Optimistic Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

He was feeling optimistic: 
His heart was tickin', click, tick, tick, 
Synthetic, hopes of a different day. 
Sparks flew across his wings. 
 
The stars are shining from a light. Engine 
The DJ is spinning. Wig wig wig 
Color vision with a blurry view: 
That's life. If he just knew 
 
His life becomes worth living 
When. He is dreaming. While he sleeps 
His life becomes worth living 
When. He is dreaming while he sleeps 
 
Monday morning. The lights are on 
Monday morning. His life is gone. 
The world is turning dark again. 
His fellow workers are alive. Again
