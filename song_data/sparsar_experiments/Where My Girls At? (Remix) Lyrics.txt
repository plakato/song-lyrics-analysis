Where My Girls At? (Remix) Lyrics
by 702.

Fabolous - talking.
Uh huh, uh huh, Fabolous, 702.
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.
Uh huh, uh huh.

Fabolous.
Now of these other chicks don't even come close to you.
Anythin less than a dime, ain't negotiable.
There holla Fabolous when I swing the Testarossa through.
Maybe cause I'm close to Clue, I be in posters too.
I rock so much ice, you need shades for a closer view.
I beep the horn, that's the most I do.
Like what this player supposed to do.
Fuck it, pack your bags, let's spend the weekend in Costa boo.
You feelin that?

702.
See he's my property and any girl that touch.
I might just call your bluff.
Cause I don't give a fuck.
Who are you to call my cell.
Oh I'm a wish you well.
Cause any girl that tried has fell.

Where my girls at.
From the front to back.
Well is you feelin that.

Tryin to take my man, see I don't need that.
So don't play yourself.

Where my girls at.
From the front to back.
Well is you feelin that.

Tryin' to take my man, see I don't need that.

702.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't you violate me.
Cause I'm a make ya hate me.
If you decide to mess with mine.
Shrunk you down to size.
Make ya realize.
You done messed up this time.

Break - 702.
You must learn the rules.
Don't come close to.
Anything that belongs to me.
He is my, my property.
So you must leave.

Fabolous - talking behind Break.
Uh huh, uh huh, Where my girls at?
Fabolous, F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S.
Uh, uh, uh.

Fabolous.
Don't front ma, who kept you rockin all the stones?
Hit the mall, you can pick and roll like Stockton and Malone.
Must of dropped bread on my skew, girls be flockin to my home.
When I got a case, quick tryin to get Cochran on the phone.
Chicks don't want you in karats, that make your pinkie finger glow.
They wanna argue and are fightin on the Jerry Springer show.
Yours friends want Fabolous, there's more fishes in the sea.
Schemin since I put the deep dishes on the V.
Just to let you know, it's nothin when you ask for green.
Took you to Cristal, for them cats and cream.
I'm the one that had you rockin Icebergs to affairs.
Icebergs for your gear, Icebergs in your hair.
I don't know how them dirty birds got the cell digits.
When I come home you pat me down like jail visits.
All I wanna do is stay close to you.
Fabolous, Desert Storm, 702.
Ya heard.
