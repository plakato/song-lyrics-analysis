100 Laps (Keep Running) Lyrics
by TyC // 95 KiD.


Running a hundred laps.
Smoking like lumberjacks.
Yo Hun relax to the smoke of a hundred stacks.
We hungry cats, catapult no matter if we collapse.
Make money, - the logic, your assumption lacks.
It‘s funny, - You fake MCs get stumped with an axe.
I sleigh em‘ faithfully, playfully I‘m humping the mass.
Polin‘ the thump of the axis with simple practice over.
Yoghurt, - you got old like SixAxis‘ Controllers.
I think I'm getting it from these extra pedestrians.
Hexing my pentagram like Channing Tatum turning tables.
\- Fables - extra terestrial new interpreter.
Celestrial god, a true Intruder in your sector.
\- Intruder in your girl, but she let me.
Licking the pussy like Argentinian Lecci,.
Dulce de leche for you gretchens and dummies.
Learning lessons that all your money may shine.
But ain't no sun shine.

Running my laps on these streets I keep running.
And I'm still on the come up release.
Many dun show me they shadows about something.
And I still got love for my peeps.

All my peoples in the left.
All my peoples in the right.
All my peoples in the back.
Where you at?
All my peoples in the left.
All my peoples in the right.
All my peoples in the front.
Light a blunt!

Copping those boots.
While shopping at leather taylor's.
I got them Catapillars with camouflage and them cuts open.
Soon as I touch wake, your jaws bust up.
Cause thats whats up, we leave em'fucked with they ass showing.
You like classics…? Then welcome to the new age.
Plastic bitches, plus a fresh glass of Koolaid.
Right mic – check up, Lazy people get up.
\- We out here to get this party up kickin‘ wild.
Shaolin, I'm just a part of a mile away.
Still I smile like the sun shines my way.
I don't relate to all your Hustles and pistols bangers.
\- Bitches hanging up phones after you didn't bang her.
This a banger, from Boston to Bangladesh.
We keep it fresh with the Jiggy, keepin it wiggy.
This one's for my peoples in the city.
Shout out to the ville of Z, we getting silly.

Running my laps on these streets I keep running.
And I'm still on the come up release.
Many dun tell me farewell bout something.
And I still got love for my peeps.

All my peoples in the left.
All my peoples in the right.
All my peoples in the back.
Where you at?
All my peoples in the left.
All my peoples in the right.
All my peoples in the front.
Light a blunt!
