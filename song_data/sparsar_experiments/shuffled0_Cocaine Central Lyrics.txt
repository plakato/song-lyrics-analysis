Cocaine Central Lyrics
by Wu Block.

Some of my best side bitches I ever had.
next steve jobs.
Whip fresh out the dealer think tonite gone be fun.
Shades on blocking the sun.
Hustle get the weed to spark.
Niggas hustle hard.
Coke connect already calling.
Triple black ratchets champion cone hoods.
But I don't give a fuck.
Shooters indeed jail system taught him to read.
And I ain't gotta knock on wood.
An oily based extract from green leaves.
I kept in a bottle.
Packaged up then retailed on the street.
Pardon self never the wrong hood I'm safe.
Rolex goggles.
Feel a rush from cuba no cut that's pearl.
My block is cocaine central.
Eat your food with ancient or new crew utensils.
With emerald green birthstones in my bling.
We can do better when his prices start falling.


Hand me my gun.
Bob barker microphones I get paper.
Niggas outside all day even after dark.

She laying there.
With my connect I may be the.
Barely staying up.
Sniff that girl whiff that girl.
Coke in my blood weed in my lungs.
About to get some fried chicken from Wong's.
college degrees god.
I got uh.

I told him I'll take him but.
Set out to dry but comes right from the heat.
Just like everything you learn you're gonna teach to your seed yo.
Ass all fat in her thongs.
Nowadays I feel there's no need to be greed.
Cause you can make the same money off of pills and weed.
Fishscale mental.
Streets taught him how to kill wolves taught him to feed.
My best custies is nerds with.
Sniff city needle park.
Raindrops of water that turn into hard glaciers.
Like the Gods don't believe in God.
Turbaned up like a royal prince from medeen.
Yonkers all through brownsville that's sheek's.
Keep that feather weight by me nigga yeah.
Cocaine central.
I clap off try me nigga.
Blending in with killers that visit the wrong hood.
