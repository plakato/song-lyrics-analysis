Hollow Son Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

My castle sits high above the clouds for all to see.
I don't want to brag. But if father were still here, he'd be proud to say the.
least.
My kingdom lies low, below my gates, beneath my feet.
I know brother is down there looking up at me with jealousy.
I'm the older one of my father's sons. The lovable, deserving one. Look at all.
I've done.

Brother, the difference between you and I is that I've worked skin to bone for.
my whole life.
You stole your share. I slaved for mine. Saw you walk away, left this family.
behind.
You binged. You roamed. But all that old man remembered was dirty broke you.
coming home.
I'm glad he died. I took over and did things right.

Why am I cold inside? Been years since dance and music brightened these walls.
My failures haunt me. My screams echo down the dark empty halls.
Every success I've built this tower on lifts me further away from everyone.

I wish I could buy love; all I can afford is lust.
Drunk on myself, but this liquor's never strong enough. Gained the world. Lost.
my soul.
Alone, I sit and rot in this whitewashed tomb. I hate how he forgave you.
I wish it was me by his side at his death. But I couldn't stand you, so I left.

I wondered why my people live in fear. No one names their sons after me.
Father now I seeâ€¦cause you led like our servant. I lead a tyranny.
I'm not fit for a king. I wish you were still here to run things.
I wish you were here to tell me that you loved me.

Father, if you spoke today, I think you'd say, I love you both just the same.
Nothing you could ever do can change that or take it away. Come back to me..
I tried to keep you close, but I got in-between.
The cure to this world is found in humility.
The lowest man is he who thinks he's higher than the rest.
Forget yourself. Live humbly. Forget yourself. Live humbly.
