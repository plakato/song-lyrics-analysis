Almost There Lyrics
by Swift.

Well I still recall the day you walked away.
It wasn't what I had in mind.
And it was the hardest thing to let you go.
Because I know you could have loved me if you tried.

And we were almost there.
Yes we were almost there.
And we were almost there.

Well keeping track of you is a painful thing.
How I hate to see you fall.
And how I die inside when you can't see.
That I'd love to be there with you thru it all.

Come away with me my love!
We almost had a good thing going.
Come back! Come back!
Come away with me my love!
Come back! Come back!
Come away with me my love!

You go ahead and do what you have to do.
I hope and pray you change your mind.
But if you come back, could you remember to brin my heart.
I'll stay right here so I'm not hard to find.
