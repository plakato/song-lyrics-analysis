Runners in the Night Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

I saw you rushing to the fire.
Balanced on the bones with a darkness in your eyes.
Our thoughts were crippled by desire.
Suddenly gestalt just colliding in the light.
I know, concentric rings in the bones aside.
We've surely grown up.
I know, the lead to hands that wring and dry your eyes.
Before it's too much.
Our thoughts were wicked by design.
If we could get home, then we could get us right.
I'll watch you wither up in time.
Then let you grow alone, just colliding in the light.
Though in time.
We were hanging on the subtlest sign.
Waiting on the final cry.
Just ringing out a sign.
But tonight we're surprised if we're runners in the night.
I know concentric rings in the bones don't lie.
We've surely grown up.
I know, these hands that wring they're gonna dry your eyes.
Before we give enough.
Though in time.
We were hanging on the subtle sign.
Waiting on the final cry.
But when you gonna dry your eyes.
We were holding up the keep and more.
After hanging on the final chord.
It'll be alright, his voice informed.
Just ringing out a sign.
But tonight, well you're mine.
And we're runners in the night.
After the night and more.
After hanging on the final chord.
It'll be alright, he screamed and more.
Just ringing out a sign.
But tonight, well you're mine.
And we're runners in the night.
