We Are Not Anonymous Lyrics
by Unearth.

A toast for our sins.
Our instincts drags us deeper.
Throwing us to the wolves.
The nameless were all buried long ago.

We are not anonymous.
The faceless burials are over.

They can see us now.
The fines of freedom.

They can see us now.
The fines of freedom.

Held to our curse.
We are not anonymous.
Not alone.
We are bound to bear this cross.

Held to our curse.
We are not anonymous.
Not alone.
We are bound to bear this cross.

A place for our dreams.
What better way to plant the seeds.
Of watch, reign and rule.
The nameless were buried long ago.

We are not anonymous.
The faceless burials are over.
We are not anonymous.
The faceless burials are over.
