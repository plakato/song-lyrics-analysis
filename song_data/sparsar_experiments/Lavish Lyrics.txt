Lavish Lyrics
by 415.


What is the meaning of lavish? Yo, I started with a single.
My album's out, so now it's time for me to mingle.
Well, 'lavish' to me is like mail, straight up.
So all you hungry muthafuckas pick a plate up.
Cause I'm about to feed you some dope shit.
And I'ma sit and sit and sit until it's bit.
I'm tired of the muthafuckin hype.
About the black brothers gotta be a stereotype.
You see, lavish is a one-way ticket.
And on the back is boldly stamped: 'It's time to kick it'.
Me, D-Loc, DJ Daryl and Young Tone.
We put some shit together for the microphone.
And it's lavish.

What is the meaning of lavish? Yo, despite the perpendicular.
Rap is my sport and on girls I'm real particular.
Lovin the tour shot when the fellas get to bumpin hoes.
City to city in the motels be pumpin those.
I ain't sweatin that, that ain't lavish.
Because back in the days we used to have this.
Lavish to me is watchin girls all plex.
Niggas get to trippin cause I work Rolex.
I gives a fuck about a nigga and a punk-ass bitch.
I'm with the 415, my name is Young Richie Rich.
Just a fresh young brother, no preservatives added.
And that's Double R's definition of lavish.

Rich, let me describe the motive of a player.
But first I gotta relax my feet and smoke a tailor.
Cause I'm about to spit it straight from the set.
Give it to em all as lavish as lavish can get.
First topic is monetary.
Can you handle cash? The test is kinda scary.
Cause I'm the kind of brother who has to have it lavish.
Bitches on my tip, just wish you could have this.
First off, check it, I'll describe a trap.
Down on the west side where the fresh get frap.
Boomin-ass hot thub.
With a bowl, all the bitches singin the rubadubdub.
Caviar, wine with a cracker.
And if you're pickin too hard it'll distract ya.
Rollls Royce, dip into freestyle.
And to the hoes on the set you know I'm drivin em wild.
With the high-power Zeus and the ???? boost.
Gold Rolex watches and money to boot.
We keep flowin and flowin and keep showin, you know it.
415's on the set, it's to the top where we're goin.
And it don't stop, because the hoes still jock.
And yes, players like us are still em non-stop.
DJ D in the back makin em wish that they could have this.
That's Tonio's definition of lavish.

What is the meaning of lavish? Yo, comin from the DJ.
It's goin on tour and turntables do what I say.
Spinnin and cuttin and get royalty checks.
And watchin the 415 snap necks.
See, I spin for a livin, but now I get paid.
And see they girls say that Daryl wears a high-top fade.
We're goin coast to coast, from L.A. to Miami.
I'm gettin a tux cold fitted for the Grammy's.
As a DJ, man look, I gotta spin it.

We're a rap group, we're hittin harder than the Beatles.
But my only prime: I keep tearin up needles.
When the record makes a funny sound I just grab it.
And that's DJ Daryl's definition of lavish.

Lavish to D is livin life with ease.
Straight loungin - while my money work for me.
And if the flow gets low, no sweat on mine.
I just pull out the pen and put my name on the dotted line.
You got a problem, the Locster can solve it.
Your money well is dry, mines flow like water.
I never have to worry about shit.
I ain't livin large, nigga, I'm livin lavish.
Home in the hills, my own windmill.
Satellite dish for the late nite tip.
Freaknasty for every day of the weak.
I make a nigga stand guard when I'm feelin kinda sleepy.
Everywhere I go people know the name.
I'm in the top rank because of money and fame.
Yeah, that's how I'm livin in this world of madness.
And that's D-Loc's definition of lavish.
