Dat Shit Lyrics
by Unknown Prophets.


Punk MCs are a ? to me.
They don't work productivity or constructively.
And when confronted they be ? in their seat.
Got the nerve to think they really gonna fuck with me.
Come on now.
This shit is whack.
Let's cut the chit chat.
I will do away with your career.
In a minute flat.
???, plus your whole gimmick is whack.
Don't even send out your demo.
They gon send it back.
I am here to speak the truth.
Some cats be missing facts.
Drop a couple songs and.
Swear they are sickest ??
They got the balls to drop.
An album and pretend its phat.
I couldn't tell you son.
I was too busy skipping tracks.
They got these fake ass players.
With they stinking ass, up in the club.
Like your the one she's winking at?
Shes throwing smiles at me.
I throw a ?? back.
And i just go ahead with my pimping ass.

We gon rock dat shit.
Rip dat shit.
You got some hot shit boy.
Well spit dat shit.
Drop dat shit.
Hit dat shit.
Yo we doing things you.
Only wished you did.
We moving shit.
Doing shit.
Constantly proving shit.
Would you say we.
True to this.
We be simply ludicrous.
Skip the foolish.
We fantastic.

You serving cats fictional.
Invisible.
My words will make you.
Feel miserable.
Family holding vigils.
Murdered by my lyricals.
You know my syllabus.
Be killing like ?? criminals.
Religious rituals.
Its so predictable.
?
Grabbing balls at physicals.
?
Cats want to battle.
On message boards and chatrooms.
But never in the physical.
??? mystical.
To these egotistical kids.
Whos style are shitty.
Witty, and despicable.

I got a question.
How come you sport that grin.
When you know you losing.
Its like cats want to.
Get served for their own amusement.
I guess you stepping to me isn't completely stupid.
At least after the battle you can.
Say you helped make dope music.
In a way.
Even tho the weak ass flows.
?????
?????
?????
The only people that think your.
Tight are in your crew.
And they only think you tight.
Because they hella wack.
?????
I turned down more record deals.
Then you will ever be offered.
?????
I run laps.
Around your tracks.
????
And to anyone who thinks they can roast me.
Tell it to your girl before.
She comes over to polish my trophies.
