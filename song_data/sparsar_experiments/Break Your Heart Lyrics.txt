Break Your Heart Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

Woah Woah.

Now listen to me baby.
Before I love and leave you.
They call me heart breaker.
I don't wanna deceive you.

If you fall for me.
I'm not easy to please.
Imma tear you apart.
Told you from the start, baby from the start.
I'm only gonna break break ya break break ya heart. x4.
Woah Woah.
Theres not point trying to hide it.
No point trying to evade it.
I know I got a problem.
Problem with misbehavior.

I'm only gonna break break ya break break ya heart. x4.
Woah Woah x2.
And I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold.
Like a big bad wolf I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone.
If you fall for me I'm only gonna tear you apart.
Told ya from the start.
I'm only gonna break break ya break break ya heart. x4.
Woah woah woah x4.
