Beautiful Beautilikkka Lyrics
by Swing Dee Diablo.

Swing Dee Diablo.

Beautilekkka,.
I Will Love you.
Till my Dying.
Day.
Yeah.

Swing Dee Diablo.

She Gets High With Me.
Whenever She Flies I Swear.
I Can't Get No Higher.
But I Can Get Higher.
She Says I take Her To Heaven.
Whenever I'm Inside Her.
The word Ratchet Doesn't Describe.
The Demon that Dwells Inside Her.
And I Tell Myself she Wont.
Kill me one Day.
But I Know A Ni%$as a Liar.
With Both Feet In That Fire.
And This Beautiful Ring.
That's on My Hand.
I'll Fulfill your every Desire.
Or ill kill myself right where I Stand.
And it's all Black Attire.
You gave me your hand in Marriage.
And I Will Be with You till my Dying Day.
That's My Word and I Swear It.
I'll only tell You the True meaning of Life.
Lets Hope I Dont Die Before I Share It.
It Came to Me One Night In A Dream.
Put a Stamp on It and Declare It.
That Your The Only One For Me.
When I Look in your eyes I See Me.
Your Mother hopes and Prays.
With All Her Faith.
That it's just a Phase.
But I Don't Agree.
You're The Only one I Wanna hold Hands With.
Gamble Take a Chance With.
Spells Magic Reached up for your Heart.
And I Grabbed It.
At Night I Can Hardly Breathe.
My Beautiful Beautilekkka.
My Mother Misery.
I'll Love You Eternally.
Yeah.
