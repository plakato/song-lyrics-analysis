Heathers Wall Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.

Well it feels like slow motion, I hear the gun explode.
I see the flash that brings me to my knees.
And I feel the warmth flowing out of me.

But in my mind, I'm climbing up the stairs.
And walking down the hall and Heather's standing there.
October 99, I see us in New England in the Fall.
Our love will last forever like that 8X10.
Hanging on Heather's wall, hanging on Heather's wall.

I see the money on the floor and his gun there by the door.
He was trying to rob the bank when I walked in.
Oh but this is not the way it's s'pose to end.

But in my mind, I'm climbing up the stairs.
And walking down the hall and Heather's standing there.
October 99, I see us in New England in the fall.
Our love will last forever like that 8X10.
Hanging on Heather's wall, hanging on Heather's wall.

Oh somewhere, someone says, We've lost him now.
But I look up and I see Heather's smile.
So how can I be dying?

When I'm climbing up the stairs.
And walking down the hall, and I see a bright light there.
October 99, that picture of New England in the fall.
Our love will last forever like that 8X10.
Hanging on Heather's Wall, hanging on Heather's Wall.
