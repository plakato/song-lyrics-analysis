Tortuga Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


I pull out three blunts lit up.
Then roll some more because I want.
Haters can't get what they want.
They mad cus they can't chill with us.
Little boy can't come near to us.
The pressure is to furious.
She say im too dear to her but.
I forgot bout who she was.
All my niggas pullin up so.
Deep you can't do nuthin to us.
Switch it back to me im sitting.
Back cus they dont bother us.
Who can say 'who who', I give.
No fuck bout him or anyone.
Bitch come fuck with creaking.
And my emotion dont come visit her..
WHO!
Two blunts shawty.
Here's one for yo bitch.
Sike, give it back, I don't give a hoe shit.
Bitch front a gram so we know she ain't shit.
I don't give a fuck how a hating nigga feel.
He thinkin' we broke but.
????
Your shows ain't shit nigga.
You don't even compare.
I told her come thru, she say im here.
Gucci ain't here but she.
Still say burr.
TundraMan smoking on.
That iced out pier.
Iced out blunt cryin.
Iced out tears.
Leave it up to me imma.
Break this nigga's spirit.
TundraBoy, Iceman.
Literally chilling.
Boy test me? Better make.
Sure youre really serious.
Hollowsquad cutting out of.
Any niggas feelings you bitch.
