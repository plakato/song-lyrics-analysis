B.L.A.B. Freestyle Lyrics
by Quillz.


It be Q-u-i- double LL cool in some fresh j's/.
Snapback &amp; tattoos rays bans on my face/.
Balling on these niggas looking like Dwayne Wade/.
Stay w/ that heat all a nigga do is spit flames/.
Back w/ vengeance niggas better pay attention/.
Cause a nigga on mission out to get get get it/.
Man gone check the score I'm winning I'm winning/.
You hear my sneakers sweaking err bucket swishing/.
Applying heavy pressure hell naw I ain't letting up/.
Tell these wack rappers they better step the game up/.
Still the same nigga but I rearranged my game up/.
Grinding to max man I'm all way turned up/.
Turned up turned up you gon hate me now/.
But it don't matter cause I won't stop now/.
Should had been like that but fuck it I'm on it now/.
Suggest ride upon the wavve or you bound to drown/.

Ok I took off then fell off..back where I left off/.
Now I'm up all night.. Wale no days off/.
Ask me I was better off..cause I came back way strong/.
Took time to see what was going on.. What it was I doing wrong/.
How bout it how bout it you can't tell me shit/.
Cause I'm balling I'm balling I'm balling like a bitch/.
Snapback snapback naw I ain't fitted/.
Dream killers Dream killers i don't never sleep again/.
When you dreaming, you chilled &amp; chill don't pay the bills/.
So I'm a another hungry young trying come up on a mill/.
Seeing how I'm going man I know that will/.
Make sure everybody know what my name is Quillz/.
So don't count me out, count me in.. all in, all or nothing/.
I want it super bad super bad McLoving/.
I'm so serious real tlk real tlk no bluffing/.
You catch me in everything on everything like a nuisance.
