Groupie Ass Bitch Lyrics
by 415.

Richie Rich.
Yo man, what we gon' talk about next?
Man, you know what?
I think we should talk about these groupie-ass bitches.
You know what I'm sayin?
As a matter of fact, Jed, guess who I seen the other day?
Jed.
Who?
Richie Rich.
Man, remember that bitch we seen up at that picnic.
The one who was campin like she was down with Bobby Brown?
Jed.
You mean that punk bitch that wish she were like on your album?
Richie Rich.
Yeah man, I seen her the other day, man, down on the track.
And guess what, the hoe was jockin the gold kick spins.
Jed.
D-Loc, we need to put somethin out for these fool bitches.
And let em know what time it is, man.
D-Loc.
Man, it's like this:.
When a bitch fuck with a young vet like me I treat her shit.

D-Loc.
You know the silly bitches I don't like.
The Michael Jordan-New Edition-get with a star-type.
I used to have one, with ass like a whale tail.
Wanted to get on my team cause a nigga had mail.
For those that don't know, mail means money.
But no, I don't pay for pussy, honey.
I might do the pimpin if you can do the dishin.
Cause stackin up dollars is my number one.
In this society in which we're livin.
If you're gonna have a bitch, you got to be spendin.
So to the ladies on the b.s. tip.
Sing along, fellas: you're just a groupie-ass bitch.

Richie Rich.
Haha, that's it.
Let them hoes know.
D-Loc, peep this out.
I got with a bitch about a month ago.
She ain't called me yet.
And I know when she peep the video.
She gon' be tryin to get with me.
But what would you tell a punk-ass bitch like that?

D-Loc.
Don't even call, I played ya like a foul ball.
In a month or two you'll be through.
Schemin on my label for a story or a fable.
You just caught the vapors and nothin can save you.
We used to be together on the 9 to 5.
But when I stopped spendin money, you stopped spendin time.
It's sort of like a game, so the story goes.
I was once told you reap what you sow.
If that's true, let me phrase this statement:.
Suck my dick, cause I ain't takin it.
The stories, the lies, the alibis.
You see, I'm only 19, but I'm livin the life.
So to the girlies out there I can't get with.
Men, let's come again: you're just a groupie-ass bitch.

Richie Rich.
Haha, let them hoes know.

D-Loc.
The subject of this object, if you object.
Is to get my point across as clear and correct.
As I can get when I'm talkin this shit.
Therefore I must ensure explicit lyrics.
Like: shit, bitch, fuck with this.
Put your muthafuckin stankin-ass pussy on my dick.
Ride it like a jockey in a horse race.
You better get buck wild before I bust you in the fuckin face.
I ain't soft on a bitch, I'm quite mean.
Fuckin up the doggy style with no grease.
Peace to the homies if you know what I'm sayin.
And if you don't understand - you're not a man.
You're just a hound loungin around.
Waitin to sniff some dead presidents.
I know the sex was just a collect.
Men, I tell you, we gets no respect.
Things can change if we do it our way.
You see, in '89 a bitch was made to slave.
So homies, for the last time, use your mind.
Get a grip, boss, and like a pimp.
Tell her to back off, cause she's a groupie-ass bitch.
