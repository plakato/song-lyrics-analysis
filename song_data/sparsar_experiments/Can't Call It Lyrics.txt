Can't Call It Lyrics
by Que.


Fans like wassup with the album, I can't call it.
Niggas like wassup with the label, I can't call it.
Why the hell these niggas salty, I can't call it.
When I'm coming back to the city, I can't call it.
Bitches ask me when they gon' see me, I can't call it.
A bitch ask why I cheated, I can't call it.
Ask me why I dreaded the fro, I can't call it.
I'ma tell I don't really know, I can't call it.

Nigga asking when I'ma drop, I can't call it.
Why went and bleached one lock, I can't call it.
When I'm coming back to the block, I can't call it.
That's like comparing Biggie and Pac, I can't call it.
Niggas wanna know bout the label, I can't call it.
Wasn't enough guap on the table, need more commas.
Wanna know who I'm signing next, I can't call it.
Whoever come correct with that check, nah, nah.
Bitch ask why I'm a dog, I can't call it.
Wanna know panties and bra, I can't call it.
Many bitches if I fucked her, I can't call it.
Wanna know If I really love her, I can't call it.

Your such a dog, you don't care, your so cold hearted.
Why you so cold hearted.
