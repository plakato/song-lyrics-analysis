Heart Lyrics
by VonBock.

I'M chilling drinking liquor while i'm posted at the spot. 
Tryna numb my brain, so i really think not 
Them up's and down's got me riding roller coasters 
Tripping round the world tryna be a multi coaster. 
I'M loving life livin' how I really wan na 
Recording in the studio with rolled up marijuana, 
Sucha gonah' been a slacker since the nineties 
With a gift to take a trip. Outter space is where ya'll find me. 
Stay thirsty for the hiney sipping red juice heads loose 
Been twenty four hours since I hit the bed to snooze 
Octagon, fighting and swinging for at the stars. 
But women come from venus and i'm must a man from mars. 
I put a pause. Let me figure my life out: 
Those haters, taking stabs. Guess I'm pulling my knife out. 
I'M gon na keep the ball rolling. Raising my intelligence 
Clowning on the game, can't give a fuck about my relevance: 
I'm cutting down the records when i'm feeling pretty sharp 
And spitting bout. My past, when i get a change of heart 
They tell vonbock. You got ta' pick a style, though 
But i'm doing what I want and I'll do it for a while bro 
They coming at me, tryna battle this young rap dude 
'cuz. I keeps it fucking raw ya'll get back to the cat food 
I'm in a snack mood. Don'T catch me when I'm feasting 
Adding water to the grain, for it, lifting like i'm yeastin' 
Flexing on the food chain, I'm benching on the press, 
Lifting up my arms, but the strength is in the chess god, blessed 
And. I let this young guy rest, 
, 
No quest that you'll ever see.. will be just like mine, 
, 
*sample, ques*
