Heart Lyrics
by VonBock.

I'm chilling drinking liquor while i'm posted at the spot.
Tryna numb my brain so i really think not.
Them up's and down's got me riding roller coasters.
Tripping round the world tryna be a multi coaster.
I'm loving life, livin' how I really wanna.
Recording in the studio with rolled up marijuana.
Sucha gonah', been a slacker since the nineties.
With a gift to take a trip outter space is where ya'll find me.
Stay thirsty for the hiney, sipping red juice, heads loose.
Been twenty four hours since I hit the bed to snooze.
Octagon fighting and swinging for at the stars.
But women come from venus and i'm must a man from mars.
I put a pause, let me figure my life out.
Those haters taking stabs guess I'm pulling my knife out.
I'm gonna keep the ball rolling raising my intelligence.
Clowning on the game can't give a fuck about my relevance.
I'm cutting down the records when i'm feeling pretty sharp.
And spitting bout my past when i get a change of heart.
They tell vonbock you gotta' pick a style though.
But i'm doing what I want and I'll do it for a while bro.
They coming at me tryna battle this young rap dude.
'cuz I keeps it fucking raw ya'll get back to the cat food.
I'm in a snack mood, don't catch me when I'm feasting.
Adding water to the grain for it lifting like i'm yeastin'.
Flexing on the food chain I'm benching on the press.
Lifting up my arms but the strength is in the chess god blessed.
And I let this young guy rest.

No quest, that you'll ever see.. will be just like mine.

*sample ques*.
