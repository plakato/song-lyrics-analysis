Come On Lyrics
by Swift.

Come on, come on, come on, cause everyone's waiting.
You know the wrongs from the rights, so what will you do.
I know you're scared, and you don't feel prepared, but I'll be there coaching.
you on.
So come on, go on, get on with it.

Come on, come on, come on, go tell everybody.
The way, the truth, and the life is all that they need.
So don't you wait or it might be too late.
Cause we're here for a day then we're gone.
So come on, go on, and get on with it.

Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

Come on, come on, come on, this might be your last shot.
You know it backwards and forward, so let it fly.
I know you're scared, but you're more than prepared and I'll be here leading.
you on.
So come on, come on, get on with it.
