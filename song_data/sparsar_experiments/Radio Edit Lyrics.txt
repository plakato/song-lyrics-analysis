Radio Edit Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

Na na na

Sweatshop coming through, so everybody move over. No sir, don't worry at all 
 
We're gon na break the mold and shake the whole thing. So surely they'll fall 
 
So everybody move over. No sir, don't worry at all 
 
We're gon na break the mold and shake the whole thing. So surely they'll fall 
 
Don't you figure its a little bit twisted this bullshit that gets rotated 
In. Most cases don't say shit, but we're still listenin' 
And MCs. If you decide to push your views aside, 
And choose to ride whatever's popular at the moment. Then do it 
I'll just make music? That'S dissing it 
Because. It'S just the way. You'Re thinking it'll keep our ship sinking 
And its keeping me living within a prison. 
And disconnected, isn't entered from the infinite 
And, given just a glimpse of what it is and isn't is what we're living in 
 
Trim the speech the beat since the truth. We speak. 
Bring, the heat or failure creeps in inches. We don't eat. 
We'Ll, find an image to mimic to get our 15 minutes. 
Till SoundScan drags down all our hopes to the limit 
But. Why do I have to try to dumb down the sound 
In a compromise to try to turn sails around 
If? I speak my piece: will the interest cease? 
Well at least will get a week 
And if they're driven to spin it 
We'll make change from within it. 
But, if not we'll, get got cause bitter washed-up, cynics 
Pretend to like spot hype and we'll be alright 
Singing right for the fight, and we can better this life 
 
Mmm. I wonder how to leave the underground with dignity intact and be the
rappers that we are today. We say, but even fatter 
So, we'll tour in tons of towns and bump the sound for kids that need the facts
and fiend for rap and something to say, but in this industry is backwards. 
Mmm without radio play your sales may be. Okay, maybe you'll stay afloat. Maybe
Plenty of tape, maybe you'll drown, turn the radio down 
Who's that Sweatshop and we shaking your ground 
 
Love, to hand feed everyone, 
Do believe its fundamental to need funds. 
Sobering. Look at what we've become above, our heads, a web of deceit, is spun 
To, the beat of a drum we'll speak to the young 
And teach never preach of false freedom, 
Redeem some rights, some wrongs and write my songs to feed the 
And industry, pythons 
, 
No Matter what you say you better watch the snakes
