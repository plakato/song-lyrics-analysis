I'm Finally Here Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Little against me, / no felony/.
No Blackmail/ Get it no black male? / My mind off that rail/.
I'm so Canadian white everybody know/.
I'm so Canadian white my cousin is snow/.
Asher Roth/ perish the thought/ cause I'm not/.
Even my nose can rap better with iller snot/.
Though I'm antithesis/ of gangster appearances/ I'm serious/ The illest.
lyricist/ in Ontario areas/.
8th grade teach Mrs. Potonik/ got.
it/.
Living in a mosaic, forget politic! /.
Black kid always played the race card/ the white kid face's.
Beat hard/ The Indian's voice gave a joke to the retard/.
But Asian kids were good at math, we aren't/.
But all of us wanted to see the stars/.
I've never been a hoodlum/ or a Muslim/.
But I knew some/ some smart, some dumb/ some good, some scum/ Peace, it's what.
we all want and need done son/.
When we were little kids we acted like punks/.
And we were trading Yu-gi-oh spell cards/.
But in our field yard/ we still found grenade shell shards/.
Teaching us that life is a war zone/.
And we get in strife we don't like or condone/ my pain.
Is not my own/ but I've grown/ to.
write a Poem/.
From the soul as shown/ with knowledge I've always.

At home/ with my bros/ Ghetto's heaven/ I'll step in/.
That's why I like Eminem, Pac and tech/.
When I listen to them, they talk the real shit/.
That I respect/ Now I'm trying to inter-connect/.
Various thoughts in my intellect/.
The ghetto of diversity/ my stiletto in university/.
I gotta figure out something that works for me/.

First, with the Renaissance men project/.
I felt like Kate Middleton,.
royally screwed/.
Then Priestly Demolition/ I.
envisioned/.
Magnificence then loyalty moved/.
I ain't holding on to bitterness/ I ain't quitting shit/.
Going hard/ the past on my radar/ is a blinking blip/.
The holy one know me/ as Hip-hop's Obi-Wan Kenobi/.
Use the force/ pass the torch/ I.
even go hard on a slow beat/.
But time for Sabbath, time to be relaxing/.
Heavy burden is off, time to lay back then/.
To give you words/ and proverbs/ from my own mind/.
To learn is human but to teach is divine/.
First/ if you work/ your ass off, you won't take crap/.
And you can be hustling without selling crack/.
In fact/ the words of the track/ should make you feel/.
Hip-hop is like Wendy's you know when it's real/.
Divinely inspired, pray/ three time a day/.
Like eating meals/ it's nourishment in a way/.
So then I knell/ â€˜Please Lord, help me to live this'/.
Cause I just can't live life without forgiveness.'/.

- Rob Bell's Sermon on Forgiveness can be found here-.

To quote Gandalf we cannot choose the time we live in/ We can only Choose/.
what we do/ with the time we are given/.
So I'd rather be poor and righteous, than rich and wicked/.
And say what I mean and mean what I say, when I spit it/.
But Nas said it best for me and my game yo/.
It was clear why the struggle was so painful/.
Metamorphosis this is what I changed to/.
And God, I'm so thankful/.
