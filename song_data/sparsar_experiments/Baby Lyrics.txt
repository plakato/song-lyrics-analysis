Baby Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.


Nothing so bright
Nothing so smooth
Nothing so pure
As, my baby

All of my life
Days into night
All. I did dream
Was my baby

Until, the day
Darkness entwined
With silver eyes
Was, my baby staring
At me

Interlude 
And. Since then, I can't see straight
And since then my smile's been fake

Funny. I know
The troubles I've seen
But through one eye. Only
That'S clear

If you bring along your needles
Then I'll bring my sharpened pencils
And draw one more comic, tragedy
My baby

So call up the child players
From, madam we'll rent the parlor
And dance to death
Till. I can't see
My baby
