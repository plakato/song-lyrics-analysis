Hunger - Radio Edit Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

Oh, I got the hunger.
It moves but won't lose it.
I'm not gettin' younger.
I use it, abusively.

I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
It's takin' me under till it takes me away.
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
I won't surrender, still it takes me away.

It's been five years waitin' around for.
Crooks that will swallow gold.
Sick of being seen, tired of these?
It won't save me, it won't please me, no.
I got a hunger, it will not let go.
I got too many roads to know.

I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
It's takin' me under till it takes me away.
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
I won't surrender, still it takes me away.

It's been too many times, I've tested myself.
Waiting up on Nemo, absolute you.
Mother Lung, gimme a heart shake.
Suffer, this maze I gotta break.
It won't let up, it won't save me, no.
I got a hunger that will not let go.
I got too many roads to know.

I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
It's takin' me under till it takes me away.
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
I won't surrender, still it takes me away.

There is something I want.
I long for, I need.
There is something I want.
I long for, I need.

I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
It's takin' me under till it takes me away.
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins.
I won't surrender, still it takes me away.
