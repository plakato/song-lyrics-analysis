Fading out of Love Lyrics
by The Union.


If we were a picture, wouldn't have to look too hard.
To see something's missing, that was there at the start.
What's the use in lying? Only fooling, I say.
Even if we were stronger, it was still her to say.
Wouldn't be any easier, there was someone else to blame.
How come this be happening? I never thought Iâ€˜d have to say.

Tell me, darling, are we fading out of love?
I can't take it, we're fading out of love.
Tell me, baby.

You used to be the finest, shining like gold.
There ain't nothing sadder than the warmest love growing cold.
Watching the water as I roll off, is drifting away.

Tell me, darling, are we fading out of love?
I can't believe, we're fading out of love.
Oh, say it, baby.
Fading away.
Watching the water as I roll off, is drifting away.
How can this be happening this way?

Tell me, darling, are we fading out of love?
I can't take it, are we fading out of love?
Oh, we're fading out of love.
