Dead End Justice Lyrics
by The Runaways.


I'm a blond bombshell and I wear it well.
You're momma says you go straight to hell.
I'm sweet sixteen and a rebel queen.
I look real hot in my tight blue jeans.

Dead end kids in the danger zone.
All of you are drunk or stoned.
Dead end kids you're not alone.
You sleep on the street when you're not at home.

Long hot summers make you wanna fight.
The roar of the city lasts all night.
You like drugs you like brew.
You won't believe what I can do to you.

Dead end kids in the danger zone.
All of you are drunk or stoned.
Dead end kids you're not alone.
You sleep in the street when you're not at home.

I got away clean with my fake ID.
No more school or mommy for me.
Stealing cars and breaking hearts.
Pills and thrills and acting smart.

Dead end kids in the danger zone.
All of you are drunk or stoned.
Dead end kids you're not alone.
You sleep in the street when you're not at home.

In the naked city.
Spaces ain't that pretty.
As I was getting dusted.
I happened to get busted.
Oh yes I was arrested.
Oh god how I protested.
They beat me with a board.
It hurt just like a sword.
They kicked me in the eye.
My brain began to fry.
This is like a movie.
I know I'm gonna scream.
All the pain that I feel.
Makes me feel mean.
It's so sad and crazy here.
I think I'm gonna cry.
If I don't wake up from this dream.
I think I'm gonna........die.

Where am !?
Your in a cheap run down teenage jail thats where.
Oh my god!
Yeah blondie your gonna be here till your 18 so get used to it.

Behind the bars, there's a superstar.
Who never had a chance.
She could sing, she could dance.
You don't sing and dance in juvie honey.
Behind the walls, they've seen it all.
Gotta have, gotta have.

Justice, justice.
Don't want your law and order.
Justice, justice.
Or world wide disorder.

What you in for?
Wouldn't you like to know.
Behind the fence, there is no defense.
There's murder, rape and bribery.
In and out, burglary.
You don't look so tough.
Oh I been around.
On the planet sorrow, there is no tommorrow.
Gonna get......

Justice, justice.
Don't want your law and order.
Justice, justice.
Or world wide disorder.

You can't turn off the tears.
They crawl in juvenile hall.
Cruel reform schools.
They don't smile, they got no bail or jury trial.
Joan, lets break out tonite.
Ok Cherie, whats the plan?

You grab the guard, in the prison yard.
Get his keys and gun, we'll run.
My old man's waiting outside in a van.
Is he handsome?
You'll see.
Cause you know, we gotta be free.

Justice, justice.
Don't want your law and order.
Justice, justice.
Or world wide disorder.

We'll go far through the prison yard.
You and me, we will be free.
Just be safe, don't be late.
If you see the guard don't hesitate.

But Joan I'm getting tired.
I've run out of fire.
I can't go any farther.
But Cherie you must try harder.
Joan, I'm down, my ankle.
I can't go on, but I can't leave you.
What do I do?
Save yourself, you know what you gotta do.
OH MY GOD.
