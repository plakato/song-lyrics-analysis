I Am One Lyrics
by +44.

I am one as you are three.
Try to find messiah in your trinity.
Your city to burn.
Your city to burn.
Try to look for something.
In your city to burn, you'll burn.
Am I as I seem?
I'm down.
Down, so down.

Time is right for a guiding light.
Try to turn to reasons in your bitter life.
Your city to burn.
Your city to burn.
Try to look for something.
In your city to burn, you'll burn.

See you, don't you just want to.
See you, I am one.
See you, don't you just want to.
See you.

See you, don't you just want to.
See you, I am one.
See you, don't you just want to.
See you, I am one.
