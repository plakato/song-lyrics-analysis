Comin up Flat Lyrics
by Rx.

Single comin...

Wrap your head around this, slammed in a door.
Rx is here now, worry no more. I got your back straight gat flat right to the.
floor.
I been around the block a few times, dime and a whore. I got more scary movie.
then you got for gore.

core.....

I ain't been done yet, your wishes ain't true.
You gettin burned up worse then a holocaust jew. No disrespect to religions my.
bad.
But ill say what I need to hit the mainstream fad.
You can call me a rapper, you can just call me bad.
But not one day passed I can say I was glad.
Not the trash bag, my future is lagged.
Anyone get in my ways gettin bound to the gagged.
Chloroform soaked on a rag, I dont care if your ten, or 80 some sag.

This is the final, im makin the cut.
You better watch your girlfriend, shes takin it straight up the butt.
Ill move in whether you married or friends.
I hit all those bitches rated as tens.
You been rappin on coffins sportin depends.
Relationships broken know no name for the mends.
The rules ive taken, molded up like a benz.
They been crafted, wretched and bend.
You got a death note, it already been sent.

You a joke, circus of tent.
Im givin up bullshit, as a tribute to Lent.
