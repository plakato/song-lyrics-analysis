I Wanna Rock Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

I wanna rock!
I wanna rock!
I want to rock.
I wanna rock!

Turn it down you say.
Well all I got to say to you is time again I say, No!
No! No, No, No, No, No!
Tell me not to play.
Well, all I got to say to you when you tell me not to play.
I say, No!
No! No, No, No, No, No!
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it.
There's only one thing I can say to you.

I wanna rock!
I wanna rock!
I want to rock.
I wanna rock!

There's a feelin' that.
I get from nothin' else and there ain't nothin' in the world.
That makes me go!
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
Turn the power up.
I've waited for so long so I could hear my favorite song so.
Let's go!
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me.
There's nothin' else that I would rather do.

I wanna rock!
I wanna rock!
I want to rock.
I wanna rock!
