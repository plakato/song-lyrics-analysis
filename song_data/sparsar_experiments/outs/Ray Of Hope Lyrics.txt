Ray Of Hope Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

Save me from falling*.
Hey, now it's all the same again.
What I wanted to keep has gone astray.
And I'm running like I'm insane.
Just to get another chance to blow my mind.
You are my ray of hope.
Enlight the dark I cannot cope.
Save me from falling and trust me.
You're the only one.
I have never gone this far.
Should I take.
Another step and risk it all.
Did you recognize those stars.
One will be my own if I would dare to reach.
You are my ray of hope.
Enlight the dark I cannot cope.
Save me from falling and trust me.
YOu're the only one.
SDome day my tries will be rewarded.
You will see - I WILL BE RISING.
Some tim when wounds have turned to scars.
See my mind - STRONGER THAN ALL.
You are my ray of hope.
Enlight the dark I cannot cope.
Save me from falling and trust me.
YOu're the only one.
