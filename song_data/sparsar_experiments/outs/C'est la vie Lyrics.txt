C'est la vie Lyrics
by Viza.

C'est La Vie! Forgive me if you even dare.
Striking the hands of time, sipping the blood that maims.
Shaping the grand finale by all means its yours to claim.

Make up your mind.
Serve your time.
It's only life.

Sifting with rumored gloves, finding the barren well.
Lifting the curse above by all means its yours to spell.

Make up your mind.
Serve your time.
It's only life.

C'est La Vie! Forgive me if you even dare.
C'est La Vie! Forget me I don't even care.

Its your vengeance that carries me most.
Its your sweetness that buries me most.

Forgive me if I…
Forgive me if I don't care.
Forget me…
Forget me if I don't care.

Make up your mind.
Serve your time.
It's only life.
