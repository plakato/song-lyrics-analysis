Always On My Mind Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Maybe I didn't treat you.
Quite as good as I should have.
Maybe I didn't love you.
Quite as often as I should have.
Little things, I should have said and done.
I just never took the time....

You were always on my mind.
You were always on my mind.

Maybe I didn't hold you.
All those lonely lonely times.
And I guess I never told you.
I'm so happy that your mine.
If I made you feel second best.
Well I'm sorry I was blind.

You were always on my mind.
You were always on my mind.

Tell, Tell me, Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died.
Give to me, give me one more chance.
To keep you satisfied, satisfied.

Little things I should have said and done.
I just never took the time.
You were always on my mind, yeah....
You were always on my mind.....
