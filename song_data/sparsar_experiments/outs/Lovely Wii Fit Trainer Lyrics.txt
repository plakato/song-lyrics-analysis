Lovely Wii Fit Trainer Lyrics
by Yungtown.


June 11th, the day I will soon not forget.
It felt like Christmas viewin' a Nintendo Direct.
Without a minute to rest or a second to waste.
I left out of bed to run to my beautiful escape.
Onto the usual place, online to an E3 2013 and I'm feelin' alright.
Cause on the horizon is a shining light from a brand new Smash Brothers.
And I hope I like it.
Why can't I analyze what Sakurai mind you I've tried to decide.
But my brain doesn't like to disagree with my heart.
Cause all I want to see is my favorite girl in the fight too.
Missin' those times when we tried to get fit.
Though you're like a mannequin, but behind the window.
And now that you're weighing in, my feelings are something that I have to.
disclose.

Beautiful Wii Fit Trainer.
The way that you move is so captivating.
Mega Man, he can sit down.
Cause I've been waitin' for the day that you arrive.
So that I could play ya.
Just so I could play ya.
Just so I could play ya.
Just so I could play ya.
My lovely Wii Fit Trainer.

Oh, yeah, you had me worried.
That trailer was so disturbing.
Cause I thought you wouldn't appear on our one year anniversary.
I lost 15 pounds meeting my weight goal.
But there is more to what I have to say.
I'm attracted today, because I lost that weight for you.
The trailer went off and later on Nintendo made an announcement.
I looked over at my friend and said What if? and he said Doubt it.
But what I never lost was hope because it's hard to predict the outcome.
That's why I had to catch my breath from the second moment I saw ya, the.

Beautiful Wii Fit Trainer.
The way that you move is so captivating.
Mega Man, he can sit down.
Cause I've been waitin' for the day that you arrive.
So that I could play ya.
Just so I could play ya.
Just so I could play ya.
Just so I could play ya.
My lovely Wii Fit Trainer.
