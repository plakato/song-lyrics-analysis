Pleasure and Pain Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Ahhhh.
You were one of a kind.
So sexy and fine.
Jsut lioke a prince from a storybook.
You faded my mind then thru me aline.

You said from the start if we were ever apart.
That you'd be thinking of me.
Are you wasting my time.
Just feeding me lines.
Or do you really love.
Pleasure and pain.
I'm going insane but i love the things you do cuz pleasure and pain are one in.
the same when it comes to loving you.

How long will this last.
Is the question i ask.
Yo treat me so cruel but you're my best friend.
You siad i n the past.
That other won't last.
I feel like a fool.
When will the madness end.
I never could hide the way you touched me inside would always leve me sighing.
I never knew that you would be so untrue and leave me crying.
I've opened my eyes now baby i realize.
That you should never waste love.
You treated me bad and now i'm dissing you back so can get a taste of.
