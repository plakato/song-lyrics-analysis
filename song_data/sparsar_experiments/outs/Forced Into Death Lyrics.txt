Forced Into Death Lyrics
by The Virus.

He's an evil man with a twisted mind.
He used his brain to clone humankind.
In his lab, his days are spent.
Collecting funds from the government.

Forced into death .. Children on the table.
Forced into death .. Make them work if they're able.
Forced into death ..Now he's testing on your brain.
Forced into death .. Driving you insane.

They treated Hitler's words as the words of god.
Justifying the lives that he robbed.
Joseph Mengele didn't care.
Rooms filled with teeth and human hair.

Forced into death .. Children on the table.
Forced into death .. Make them work if they're able.
Forced into death ..Now he's testing on your brain.
Forced into death .. Driving you insane.

America's not far behind.
From Mengele and Hitler's time.
Read about cloning in the news.
Think of what happened to the Jews.
Think about the total cost.
They killed the wives, they killed the children.
Remember those whose lives were lost.
To alleviate a racial burden?

All your dreams and all you hoped for.
And the souls of the dead will forever last.
And no on else can close the same door.

Forced into death - Driving you insane.
