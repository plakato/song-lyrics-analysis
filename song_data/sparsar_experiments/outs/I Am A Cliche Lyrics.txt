I Am A Cliche Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

I am a cliche.
I am a cliche.
I am a cliche.
I am a cliche.
I am a cliche you've seen before.
I am a cliche that lives next door.
I am a cliche, you know what I mean.
I am a cliche, pink is obscene.
Yama, yama, yama.
Yama, yama, yama.
Boredom, boredom.
Boring boredom.
Yama, yama, yama.
Yama, yama, yama.
Boredom, boredom.
Boring boredom.
