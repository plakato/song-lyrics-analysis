Lake House Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

Oh my Lord.
What a shallow home.
I'm wide awake out on the lake.
At 3 AM I sleep again.

Watch the tides rise right between my eyes.
It's in my head.
Well I'll be dead before the sun will rise again.

Oh my Lord.
What a shallow home.
I'm wide awake out on the lake.
At 3 AM I sleep again.

It's in my head.
Well I'll be dead before the sun will rise again.
