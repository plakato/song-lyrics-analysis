Song: All My Love.

I'm taking you back.
I'm taking you back.
Here's another one.

Queen Pen.
Uh, yeah.
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard.
Back in the day in the projects.
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick.
Seeing him made me go back in my lab.
And write this lil' shit like this.
Check it out.

Here's how it goes.
Used to see you when I went to the store.
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window.
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with.
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash.

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes.
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive.
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs.
With hopes to get close to you.

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep.
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets.
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet.
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet.

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew.
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you.
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do.
To give all my love to you, my God.

Eric.
Can't feel myself.
Don't want nobody else to ever love you.
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy.
There's not a minute, hour, day or night.
I don't love you.
You're at the top of my list.
Cuz I'm always thinking of you.

All my love.

A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough.

I just don't wanna stop.
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much.

Queen Pen.
Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew.
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew.
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning.
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit.

Talked about that sex like I was used to it.
Lying about how many you used to kiss.
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real.
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels.

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that.
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched.
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt.
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work.

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad.
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young.
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you.
My God.

Eric.
Can't feel myself.
Don't want nobody else to ever love you.
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy.
There's not a minute, hour, day or night.
I don't love you.
You're at the top of my list.
Cuz I'm always thinking of you.

All my love.

A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough.

I just don't wanna stop.
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much.

Both.
The breakdown, now bounce to this.
Yeah, dedicated to the first love.
Uh, you know who you are, from the hood.
It's all good  yeah.
We gon' bounce ta dis.
We make moves with this.
Cuz all my love's to you.
Now bounce.
