Low Life Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


I'm nothing but a low life.
Thinking 'bout my own life.
I can't help myself from falling.
Can't help myself from falling.
I'm nothing but a low life.
Thinking 'bout my own life.
I'm trying to fight the good old fight.
But after it all, I'm still just a low life.

Jamie N Commons.
Wanna be a better man, but it's a hard life.
Without that love inside you, it's a cold bind.
I started to reflect on all that's been before.
Started to wonder, but, but you can't be sure.

Now please tell me I'm broke.
It's much easier that way cause I just let you down.
It's much easier that way.

I'm nothing but a low life.
Thinking 'bout my own life.
I can't help myself from falling.
Can't help myself from falling.
I'm nothing but a low life.
Thinking 'bout my own life.
I'm trying to fight the good old fight.
But after it all, I'm still just a low life.

Jamie N Commons.
There are words in my mind in the candlelight.
Cold hands on my heart keeping slow time.
And I started to reflect on all that's been before.
Started to wonder, but you, you can't be sure.

Now please tell me I'm broke.
It's much easier that way cause I just let you down.
It's much easier that way.

I'm nothing but a low life.
Thinking 'bout my own life.
I can't help myself from falling.
Can't help myself from falling.
I'm nothing but a low life.
Thinking 'bout my own life.
I'm trying to fight the good old fight.
But after it all, I'm still just a low life.

X Ambassadors &amp; Jamie N Commons.
I'm still just a low life.
Nothing but a low life.
I can't help myself from falling.
I can't help myself from falling.
Still just a low life.
I'm nothing but a low life.
I'm trying to fight the good old fight.
But after it all, I'm still just a low life.

I'm nothing but a low life.
Thinking 'bout my own life.
I can't help myself from falling.
Can't help myself from falling.
I'm nothing but a low life.
Oh, I'm thinking 'bout my own life.
I'm trying to fight the good old fight.
But after it all, I'm still just a low life.
