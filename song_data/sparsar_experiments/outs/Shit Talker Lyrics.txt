Shit Talker Lyrics
by Un-Ez.


My name Un-EZ EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, 
, 
Yo fucking, your bitch is ez, 
I mean ez 
I'm trynna feature Chris Brown 
To get closer to RiRi, 
Haters be like ha ha 
My ex's, be like he. He 
My pockets, look like 
They, posing for a picture. 
Cheesy 
Look I'm contemplating 
How many rappers, I'm slaying. 
My life has been a battle with 
Satan like pastor mason 
Test, my patience, 
Your career 
Gone on a permanent vacation 
Ninja smoke, 
Assholes poof 
Y'all can't see me 
I'm Andrea, Bocelli, nigga Ray charles Stevie 
Kinda. Like them. 
Couldn'T picture myself on T.V 
But y'all deserve to see me. 
I came from the bottom. Nothing like Drake 
More, like Weezy push some shhhhhh, not quite Jeezy 
Had to drop outta school like Kanyeezzy 
So middle finger to the world. 
That made me so Un-Ez 
After. All I been through man 
This rap shit is EZ 
, 
My name Un-EZ EZ EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, 
My name, Un-EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, 
 
Anticipating, my come up. 
Y'All can tell them labels, I'm anticipating some commas 
Cause. I know that they able 
I swear to God, 
I'm getting I'm getting. My point across 
I know some niggas who will snatch a 
Chain. If I point a cross 
And all. I need a 
A few shots to get me sauce, 
And, a bad bitch, who'll roll on a philly 
Like, a bad eagles loss, 
There's levels to this shit. Man 
Levels to this shit 
If these niggas hot, I'm devil in this bitch 
Like magic in the all star game. Back 
In, 96 
With HIV 
And still have the whole world on his dick 
Behind. The back pass to myself. 
I, don't need your assist 
After. My first LP I'll sample my own shit, 
Yo, I'm dumb wit, it 
I am, I am so hung wit it 
Leave your ass sprung, wit. It 
Until my lungs quitting 
Till my heart collapse, 
Until until I'm done winning 
Tie my laces kinda of attitude 
If not get hung, wit, it 
, 
My, name, Un-EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, 
My, name, Un-EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, 
 
Trynna make up For losses, 
Don't judge me by my past 
We all got ta, carry our crosses 
So. You can kiss my ass 
Like. Jesus did 
He's proof that you don't got ta do wrong. 
And still could serve. A bid still can serve a bid 
If not through your life. Through modern slavery, 
Services the names Un-ez like nerviness 
A twitch inside of your heart, the first time you hear me 
Murder shit, 
The, imperfect preciseness of michealangelo 
When, i paint 16's 
Chapels, my tabanaco a jungle west from the rotten apple 

If. They hassle my hustle, I'm ready for battle, I'm leaving them baffled when we
blitz 
Yo 
Guards are getting tackled. 
Kings are getting shackled, 
Bosses dictators and pharaohs 
Getting picked like an afro 
I'm coming like shots. If i run 
Out of bullets, I'm airing like 
Like poisonous arrows 
Aimed at they Gucci Versaci Louis apparel, 
Your, 60 frames per second 
Are too slow for my limitless 
Catalog arsenal. Rolodex 
Yes, i am in control of this 
I eat Mc's 
In any order, fuck a menu order, all of it 
 
Switching lanes like a motorist in bad traffic. 
All, i think, is dope like a fucking crack addict 
As. Far as this rap shit goes, I'm a fucking animal 
I'll eat your face up, go home and watch hannibal; 
Ez

My name, Un-EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, 
My, name, Un-EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ, EZ
