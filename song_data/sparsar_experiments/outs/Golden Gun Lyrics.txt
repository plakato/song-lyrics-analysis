Golden Gun Lyrics
by VI Seconds.


Don'T fucking move 
Everything in your pockets right now, 
Sh-sh-sh-sh-shut the fuck up, 
Shut up 
Don't, say anything 
Everything in your pockets. Right now, 
Don't try to be a hero, neither 
Everything 
Everything out your pockets, 
Now nigga, 
Now, nigga, 
NOW, nigga, 
, 
Look, 
Easy way or hard way. 
What you really wan na do 
Cause your move will affect how we part ways 
Easy way or hard way, 
Pick and choose 
Cause. This shit is real boy and I ain't got all day 
I'm. On a mission. I got paper to stack 
And if you play with my stacks, I'm taking aim with a strap 
I'm'bout to hold these karats 
With a burner made of more than fourteen karats 
What's good 
Me. When I'm hopping out the chamber, 
When, I'm pulling up niggas know that it's danger 
I'm one that stay with the drum like a band geek 
Exotic in the rap solid gold. When we ash these 
Nash, please I ain't nothing that you can handle 
Try and you'll get toe open like a sandal, 
You niggas ramble, 
Ain't, nothing silent'bout a maybe 
I'm'bout. My gamble, 
 
I'm, a trillion dollar BABY 
And! You gon' give me what you owe 
Yeah one shot. You don't pay me 
And the pistol's solid gold, 
 
See. I ain't really wan na have to 
Run up in this bitch, but you've been giving me a hassle 
Thought. I was a bust. Then I grant her with a grapple 
Graduated to a hustler, I'm walking with my tassle 
We, all driven, but it's something different that I'm swerving 
Laying down some yuppies, while I'm dipping through suburbans 
Heading back to Brooklyn with some Cali for the burning 
You call. It luck. I make my own luck boy, I earned this 
I wanted it and got it cause. I took it. 
Only needed a shot to the air to get'em booking 
Up out of my chair, I'm on that Ric Flair, 
WOO 
I'm, a trillion dollar child and I'mma. Look it 
Pay me 
I'm starving and they looking at me crazy, 
So, I'm running in the pockets of anyone trying to play me 
So. I suggest you put your hands up play it safely. 
I'M wiling cause I'm- 
 
Rollie on my wrist Rollie on my wrist 
OG. In the zip OG in the zip 
40 by my hip 40 by my hip 
They, know me by the six know me by the six 
Burn. A couple bands burn a couple: bands 
Burn another band burn. Another band 
All I got is everything that I earned boy 
So I'll burn another band blow, another band 
Got your boy feeling rich 
Looking, like I sold a hundred bricks 
Like. I was home whipping in the kitchen 
Made a flip off a flick of the wrist 
Got. Your boy feeling rich 
Looking, like I sold a hundred bricks 
Like. I was home whipping in the kitchen 
Made a flip off a flick of the wrist 
 
Running in your castle or your temple. 
Give me all. You got or I'll be flashing at your temple. 
The finger for my trigger aches 
So, what you want 
It's, either by me, or a ricochet 
Ain't. No! Finding holes in my plot 
My plot as a whole is giving you holes, and then I plot 
So. I suggest you give me what you owe 
Cause I'm running out of patience and this pistol's solid gold, 
So 
, 
BABY, 
You gon'. Give me what you owe 
Yeah one shot. You don't pay me 
And the pistol's, solid gold, 
 
BABY, 
OH 
PAY ME 
GOLD, 
,
