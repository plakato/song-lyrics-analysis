Better Off Lyrics
by ViZion.


Love is like a drug, it's in my system, system.
I can't get enough of it, this feeling is addicting.
And I know we're over so I really shouldn't miss this.
But when I see you out in public my heart is just skipping.
Beats, no sleep, tossing in my cold sheets.
While you're somewhere in a club, acting something like a slut.
As if summer wasn't tough, and you're really over us.
I know I fucked it up, but girl I swear that you're fucking us.
Yea it's true, I know I wasn't perfect.
Sorry for the pain I caused, maybe I'm who cursed it.
But my feelings never changed, and I don't deserve this.
Cause I'm just a person searching, for someone who's worth it.
And I found you so I cannot shut it down.
I know that you're missing me, so baby please just come around.
This feeling is real, I'm holding it close.
Dont give up on love, and let it all go oh oh oh oh.

Better off alone.
Cause I love you and I wanna make it.
Better off alone.
All alone and I'm getting wasted.
Better off alone.
I miss your touch and I really hate this.
Better off alone.
Come back home girl I'm just saying.

But you made a pick, made your bed now lay in it.
Fuck this relationship is over now there is no saving it.
Lost the love, found the hate, cold inside, novacane.
Numbs the pain and I drink champagne cause I swear it will wash you away.
And yea I'm missing you, but I'm not really missing you.
Cause its true, what they say, memories don't live like people do.

I'm sorry that I cheated but you never had to fuck with my crew.
So when you see do not see me, just walk right by.
Tired of the bullshit, little games are for the little guys.
I'm supersized, you can say king koopa size.
Over and above 'em, like I'm looking down from a flight.
So long, 3 down two up and it's deuces.
Wreckage all around us, and a heart full of bruises.
So I bulletproof this, middle finger cupid.
Miss me when I'm gone girl now I know the truth is I'm.

Better off alone.
I'm over this, I don't wanna save it.
Better off alone.
I take it back and I'm gonna make it.
Better off alone.
Living my life and I'll never waste it.
Better off alone.
'til I love again, yea I'm just saying.

Better off alone.
Better off alone.
Better off alone.
Better off alone.
