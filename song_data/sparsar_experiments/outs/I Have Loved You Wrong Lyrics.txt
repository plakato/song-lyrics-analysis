I Have Loved You Wrong Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Forgive me lover.
For I have hurt.
For I have done you wrong.

For I have hurt.
Beyond repair.
When tears occurred.
No, I didn't care.

Forgive me Lover.
For I have sinned.
For I have loved you wrong.

But this estranged organ in my chest.
Still beats for you.
It will not rest, so.
Meet me in our secret place.
When the time has come.

Rest your head.
In my lap.
And I'll lead you out of your own trap.
And I'll show you how much.
You have missed through the.
Time we weren't right.

Ah....
Ah....

So forgive me lover.
For I have sinned.
For I have let you go.

But you've been every now and then on my mind.
You're every now and then on my mind.

You're on my mind.
On my mind.

On my mind..
