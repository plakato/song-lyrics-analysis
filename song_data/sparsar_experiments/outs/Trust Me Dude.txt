Trust Me Dude
by Swelo.


Alright dudes, this is that song I was telling you about.
Like, you won't get it. You won't get it.
But then you get like, blazed.
Like, get blazed out of your mind.
And... you'll get it. Like, it just like clicks.
It just makes sense.
But you gotta at least be at like a 10.
Like, I didn't get it until I was at like a 10.

I'm chewing on some onion rings.
Stop and sit a while.
Like I'm chewing on some nasty things.
Sitting on the tile.
In the kitchen, on the floor.
Need some water, get some more.
Orange juice makes it better.
Haha, make it wetter.
Keep chewing, gulp and swallow.
Just keep breathing man.
Just follow.
Keep chewing, gulp and swallow.
Just keep breathing man.
Just follow.
Well I see a little man wearing little man's clothes.
Man I see his tiny face, and I see his tiny nose.
He like: every single day I work for my money.
I'm a keeper of the bees.
I'm a stealer of the honey.
So, just buy some quit your staring.
It's that good ish that I'm sharing.
Open your mind, and see with your mind's eye.
Man, I didn't know Daredevil was a blind guy.
superheroes running ‘round.
Looking like fools like a band when it's underground.
Harry Potter couldn't do no math.
Now if you were a wizard you could do no tasks.
Like I wish I was a wizard waving women to the west.
Whizzing by with the wind, witches, warlocks and the west.
I mean rest.
I mean test.

Break.
Dude, are you like, getting it?
No? Alright, take another hit, I'll keep playing it.

Chests and breasts are great for stress.
I'm on a quest for milk.
Comma Harvey.
Dent comma Harvey.
One face, two face.
Red face, blue face.
Let's rent an RV.
I can be Robin, you can be JoJo.
If I was Jewish, my name would be Schlomo.
And a Jewish Pokémon would be named.
Schlopoke.

Goldstein, schteen, steen.
Mean, screen, lean bean.
Bean.
Was Ender's little freen, friend.
Bend over to the side put your arm in the air.
Yoga is from India.
Just like your hair.
And the clothes that you wear.
And the songs that you hear.
And the smells in the air.
And the word pajama.
