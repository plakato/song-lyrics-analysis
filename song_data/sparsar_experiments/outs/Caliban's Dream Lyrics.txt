Caliban's Dream Lyrics
by Underworld.


As the rainï»¿ tossed above us;.
In the garden of the world.
But a flame arrives to guide us;.
Past the gold between the angles of the stars.
Watch you over all the children in the rain;.
And the streets where I remember.
Where the fire that lights a candle soars again;.
A flaring flame.
Hear it call;.
Through the darkness.
Hear it call to us all.
And start again;.
Its beating heart.
Comes again.

Instrumental: bells.
Instrumental: whistling.
Instrumental: la-la.

When the light dries all the fields.
And the joy drives out our pain.
And the nations come to greet us.
Waving molten loaves and waves of golden corn.
Can you hear us.
Oh, the spirit of the world.
May your light be ever near us.
Always heal us from the dark that we may fall.
We're a flame.
And reflect.
We're the corn.
