The Breakup Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

When the ice breaks.
When the hearts shake in the town and it marks the end of Winter.
The end of our love for now.

And you spent your Summers.
Your Summers in the south in the Central Rockies.
And I left you now.

But what'll I do?
I never thought it was true.

Under the hill star.
Above the city tonight and past the cemetery.
Where my father tried to start a new life.

And I held you tight.
We were waiting for the breakup.
All the cracks in the ice.

And what'll I do?
I never thought it was true.
Cut a line in the snow with our boots.
Split this city in two.
From Abasand and Coker Two.
The ice is gone you'll leave me too.
The ice is gone you'll leave me too.

And you will find me.
When the Summer dies stuck in McMurray.
I'll be waiting for the ice.

And what'll I do?
I never thought it was true.
Cut a line in the snow with our boots.
Split this city in two.
From Abasand and Coker Two.
The ice is gone you'll leave me too.
The ice is gone you'll leave me too.
