Priorities Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.

Sy Ari Da Kid 
Man, I feel I could've been a better man for you 
Girl. I could tell you, don't know what to do. 
And, though it might hurt, I'mma tell you the truth. 
At least most of it 
I use my priorities as an excuse. Oh no. No 
Cause girl, my priorities, should've been you 
When I got on. I was on 
Now, I'm alone with no one 
Ohhh priorities, priorities: 
Who. Are you 
, 
, Sy, Ari Da Kid 
Only? I know'bout every lie, I told 
And. I know it got cold and we don't love, blinds those 
We kiss with both eyes open 
Trust me like you, used to girl 
Want me like you used to baby 
Need me like the air. You need to breath. 
Just like your heart, gon' miss a beat. If you don't 
Get some of this sweet time, baby 
Know, you want to be mine, baby 
Let's, rewind, hey 
I, put my work before you 
I know, I'm worth it, but you 
Feel, like I hurt you its true 
You, saying it's too late 
Like. I had a curfew with you: 
Oh, no, no, no, no 
, 
, Sy, Ari Da Kid 
Girl. I could tell you, don't know what to do. 
And, though it might hurt. I'Mma tell you the truth. 
At least most of it 
I use my priorities as an excuse. Oh no, no 
Cause girl, my priorities, should've been you 
When I got on. I was on 
Now, I'm alone with no one 
Ohhh priorities: priorities: 
Who! Are you 
 
Been, ignoring these signs baby been ignoring these signs 
I'm starting to catch on now. Love me, in the mean time 
Baby I mean I'm crazy for not taking you serious 
I, guess I got live with it. Ohhh oh 
Guess, I got live with it. 
I wish I had more for you now this is it 
I, don't think I could live with this 
Can't get any more real than this ohhh. Oh 
, 
, Sy, Ari Da Kid 
Girl. I could tell you, don't know what to do. 
And, though it might hurt. I'Mma tell you the truth. 
At least most of it 
I use my priorities as an excuse. Oh no, no 
Cause girl. My priorities, should've been you 
When I got on. I was on 
Now, I'm alone with no one 
Ohhh priorities, priorities: 
Who. Are you 
 
 Sy? Ari Da Kid 
Don't know how much longer I'll, let you ignore me baby 
I, still can't believe. I ain't put you before me: baby 
Your phone on 1 %. You better call me baby. 
It was all me said, I'm sorry put it on me, baby 
When. I feel, like I could've, been a better man for you. 
Made plans for you, 
Your number one fan for you: 
I'd never put hands on you. Oh no! No! No! 
Got to prioritize on my starting five'til. Your heart is mine. 
When I got on. I was on 
Now I'm along with no one 
Oh priorities: priorities
