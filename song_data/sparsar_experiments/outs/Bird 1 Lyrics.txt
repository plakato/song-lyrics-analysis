Bird 1 Lyrics
by Underworld.


? Bat bit and ten ?
White stick with a red light.
Floats past her on the right.
White stick on the rock.
Roping in the wind.
Are you hungry?

Do you know what to eat.
Floating in the blue.
I hear you your voice.
It comes out above my head.
Close to you.
Close to you.

There is one bird in my house.
She said you woke up from a dream.
He heard Mama Cass.
He felt better if I would.
Have known those things.
It damped his mood for a second.
Then he remembered where he was.
He regained his perspective.
That felt a.
Lot better.

It gets much better.
He laid down on his bed.
With the front door open.
And the sunlight.
Flooding into the room.
He smelt tire.
He laid back listening to a fly.

He saw washing hanging.
In the sun.
He caught a fleeting.
Glimpse of a man.
Moving uphill.
Pursued by a bus.
He saw a white church with a.
Three blue-domed roof.
A crucifix on the top.
And an ant walked.
Along the edge of his book.
He heard another bell.
And a braying moustache.
And a moped started up.
Sounding like a chainsaw.
Of tiny firecrackers.
And he smelled tire again.
A fly came dim.
Along the shaft of sunlight.
Coming through the open door.
He watched it cross the room.
And get halfway and then it.
Turned around and left, he laughed.

There is one bird in my house.
