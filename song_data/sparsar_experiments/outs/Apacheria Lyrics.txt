Apacheria Lyrics
by Wray.


You got sand in your pores.
You got sand in your pores.
Standing tall.
Standing tall.
Standing tall.

It's a misgiving.
You wore.
You wore.
You wore.
You wore, now.
Gut wrenching, now.
You live.
You live.
You live.
You live here.

That stone chair.
Sitting high.
Sitting high.
