Caged Bird Part 1 Lyrics
by Zion I.

Refrain - female Voice.
Searching for a better world.
This ain't no game.
Searching for a better world.
This ain't no game.

Yeah, this is for my caged birds.
Who's fighting just like me.
Daily and nightly, so beyond getting icy.
It's likely we'll never get out here.
But we don't care, keep my mind up there.
High above all the noise and pollution, the shootin'.
The robbin' and lootin' and the mind prostitution.
Got a problem sucker that y'all can't solve.
Looking deep into my mirror, let the thoughts revolve.
Like we're an orbit on the dark side of the moon.
I can't ignore it the second coming probably soon.
Everyday, as I lay, getting tuned with the boom the pain relief is too coon,.
check this out of my room.
But my mind go free so the galaxy blooms.
Like my momma told me pray to the greatest of jews.
Picture me, rolling out, I'm holding, take control of the script.
Off my back spread my wings, my spirit can live.

Refrain - female Voice.
Searching for a better world.
This ain't no game.
Searching for a better world.
This ain't no game.

Ah, a voice rang in the emptiness.
The helplesss moan of wings that were never spread.
My song brings the evidence.
Allowing me to sing what was never said.
Parrots look down on the pidgeons who.
Comb the streets for old trash to eat.
But my head's up I strut through this bitch cause.

My feathers are your scholars ink pen.
They held their natives decorate their big men.
I represent strength and wisdom and even you can see freedom ring when my.
wings spread.
What is it about you that you have to capture.
That what you can not master.
If you can't grasp it you attack it, trap it, slam it in a cage and latch it.
Everyday that you hold me in bars is another day I can't teach your soul to.
soar.
Here both of us are, link to this song - and when you hear a caged bird, sing.
along!

Refrain - female Voice.
Searching for a better world.
This ain't no game.
Searching for a better world.
This ain't no game.
