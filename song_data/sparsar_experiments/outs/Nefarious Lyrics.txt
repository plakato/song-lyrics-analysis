Nefarious Lyrics
by X-Raided  (a.k.a. Nefarious).

X-Raided talking 
X-raided locc back in the house, 
My nigga, Big Country, 
Motherfucking, mafia, ..., hah, it's going down. 

His name - is Nefarious. ... haha 
Fin to break this shit down for you, 
My motherfucking, nigga, Isosolis 
And. We do it like this ... yeah, 
, 
It's, the same old shit everywhere. I look 
Death and destruction killing over nothin 
I know. I made a contribution 
But in the ghetto ain't. No motherfucking constitution, 
Niggas be shooting everything that don't look right. 
And. If you got an attitude, you'll catch, a ghetto flight, 
The jaws of life, can't save you when we crush ya 
I, can't trust ya, cause the homie told me you, a busta 
And motherfuckers hate to see a nigga having thangs 
You. Think I'm jokin, but I don't see nobody laughing kid. 
I want to go AWOL like a prison riot 
And. If a gaurd try's to stop me, then thats his mistake: 
Think, I'm a fake I'll brake! You off somthing serious 
It used to be X-Raided. Now it's Nefarious 
It's, very rough cause. Ain'T no other way for me to come: 
Them AWOL, motherfucking niggas on the run. 
 
X-Raided is Nefarious.
