You In January Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

Goddamn you look holy.
Hit from behind with light.
You're a painting of a saint.
And I'm nervous, stumbling over my lines.
When I tell you I love you.
When we stare at Catalina.
The city lost to the sea.
Carried out by the tides.
You were the one thing I got right.

Goddamn you look holy.
Bathed in the January light.
On the floor of our new bedroom.
On the carpet with the window open wide.
When you tell me you love me.
I can actually see it.
Your breath frozen in the air.
Newborn droplets of ice.
You were the one thing I got right.

I'm measuring heartbeats and miles away.
You held me together.
I used to burst and decay.
We got off the airplane.
A couple of runaways.
I was hoping you'd stay.
Could you stay?

You were the obvious one.
From a taxi cab in Chelsea.
Out past Salvation Mountain.
You were the obvious one.
From a walk along the highline.
Out to Wicker Park in August.
You were the obvious one.
From your Upper East Side dorm room.
To the South West Marin Headlands.
You smile into the sand.
Goddamn I hate leaving.

Another early flight.
I ran the dishwasher this morning.
I wanted there to be clean plates for you tonight.
I've grown used to your perfume.
It hangs in the morning light.
Wake me up before you leave for work.
Kiss me goodbye.
You were the one thing I got right.

I'm measuring heartbeats and miles away.
You held me together.
I used to burst and decay.
We got off the airplane.
A couple of runaways.
I was hoping you'd stay.
Could you stay?

I'm measuring heartbeats and miles away.
You held me together.
I used to burst and decay.
We got off the airplane.
A couple of runaways.
I'm glad that you stayed.
