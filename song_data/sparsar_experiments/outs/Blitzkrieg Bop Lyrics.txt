Blitzkrieg Bop Lyrics
by Sweet.


Hey ho, let's go.
Hey ho, let's go.

They're forming in a straight line.
They're going through a tight wind.
The kids are losing their minds.
The Blitzkrieg Bop.

They're piling in the back seat.
They're generating steam heat.
Pulsating to the back beat.
The Blitzkrieg Bop.

Hey ho, let's go.
Shoot'em in the back now.
What they want, I don't know.
They're all reved up and ready to go.
