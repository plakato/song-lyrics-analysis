Reason i'm rapping Lyrics
by Punsy.


 ..., They left hip, hop in pieces and fragments
Then burned its foundation and deplete it to ashes
Now. Every time I hear a song they pee on the casket
I'm, trying to bring it back. That'S the reason I'm rappin'
 .... They left hip, hop in pieces and fragments
Then burned. Its foundation and deplete it to ashes
Now every time I hear a song they pee on the casket
I'm, trying to bring it back. That'S the reason I'm rappin'

I had an epiphany. No one else is factoring. Lyrically
You have to be kidding me, I'm putting cats out their misery
I'm rapping. So viciously that I'm collapsing facilities
The backstabbing industry won't cross the path of this sick. Emcee
Your raps are weak you're, not even half of me. Mentally
I'M smashing beats sorta like when gallagar's hitting things
I'm actively killing tracks with master delivery
You're mad. Me then battle me, I'm slapping you instantly
With. The illest schemes, amazing, when I spaz on the a rhyme
I, take amateur guys and use my lines to fracture their spines
Through the passage of time i'll kill every rapper alive
And in heaven. They'Ll have up a sign, ... access, denied
This cat's in his prime. Don'T you know my rhyming is rare
Please. Don'T try compare. I could end your life with a stare
I grabbed lighting from air and shot it at the sky like a flare
Fight with lions and bears I'm placed in the asylum for care
Cuz, I'm crazy with writtens ..., I'm so technical with it. That
Your head will be spinnin' the second. The lead from my pencil
Hits, the paper quick disclaimer., Just expect to be trippin'
You'll. Forget your existence then need paramedic. Attention

Soon you'll develop a interest forming a heavy addiction
Going on terrorist missions. Just so, you get a prescription
Of, my impecable diction altering mental conditions.
