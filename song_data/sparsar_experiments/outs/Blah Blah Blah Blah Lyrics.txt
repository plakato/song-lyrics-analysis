by 702.

Hey girl, hey, where you been? Yo' phone still on? I been tryin to reach you.
My mans them said they saw you, and I was like, man I got to call her man.
I got to get at her man, and it's funny that I see you now.
Girl you so fine, look at you. Went some, wa wa wa.
Wan wa wan blah blah blah blah.

There you go, again, talking about, where have I been.
Like I'm, your child, it is, non of your biz.
Shut yo mouth, I'm tired, of hearing you, running your trap.
And by the way, I forgot to say that, your bags are packed.

Why you wanna bother me.
Constantly pagin me, drivin me crazy.
Talking that Yadi yaaa.
All up in my ear goin.

Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Silence I ain't hearin no mo' cause all I hear is.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Everytime you open yo mouth all I hear is.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Always tryin to put me in check, spittin to me that.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Sorry, boy you played yo self cause you keep sayin'.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.

See that house you in, it's yo mama's crib, you ain't got yo own.
Flossin fakin' bling, Jay-z wanna be, claimin money ain't a thang.
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, you ain't got shit just admit it.
See I'm rollin high, but you passin by, on the passenger side.

Why you wanna bother me.
Constantly pagin me, drivin me crazy.
Talking that Yadi yaaa.
All up in my ear goin.

Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Silence I ain't hearin no mo' cause all I hear is.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Everytime you open yo mouth all I hear is.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Always tryin to put me in check, spittin to me that.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Sorry, boy you played yo self cause you keep sayin'.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.

You wonder why, I don't, call you.
Baby, you're just not man enough for me no no.
Cause everytime you call my phone you just go on and on.
Talking all that nonsense, I can't take no more.

Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Silence I ain't hearin no mo' cause all I hear is.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Everytime you open yo mouth all I hear is.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Always tryin to put me in check, spittin to me that.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Sorry, boy you played yo self cause you keep sayin'.
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
