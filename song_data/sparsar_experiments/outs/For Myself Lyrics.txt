For Myself Lyrics
by S-X.


I don't need that love from nobody.
I'm deep in love, in love with myself.
Everybody's searching for somebody.
But I'm deep in love, in love with myself.

It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.
It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.
Oh woo.
It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.

I don't need that love from nobody.
I'm deep in love, in love with myself.
Everybody's searching for somebody.
But I'm deep in love, in love with myself.

It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.
It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.
Oh woo.
It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.

I don't need that love from nobody.
I'm deep in love, in love with myself.
Everybody's searching for somebody.
But I'm deep in love, in love with myself.

It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.
It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.
Oh woo.
It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.

It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.
It's ecstacy.
Oh woo.
