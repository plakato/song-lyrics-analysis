I Can't Be Your Friend Lyrics
by Rushlow.


This might come as quite a shock.
But I've given it a lot of thought.
This thing that's come between us can't be ignored.
I've taken all I can.
And this is where it's gotta end.
Cause I can't be your friend anymore.

And I can't be accused.
Of not being there for you.
How many nights have you shown up at my door?
I hope you understand.
That this wasn't in my plans.
But I can't be your friend anymore.

And it's killing me to know you.
Without having a chance to hold you.
And all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside.
You can run to me, you can laugh at me or you can walk right out that door.
But I can't be your friend anymore.

So baby now it's up to you.
Do I win or do I lose.
Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor.
Well take me as I am.
Cause I wanna be your man.
But I can't be your friend anymore.

And it's killing me to know you.
Without having a chance to hold you.
Yeah all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside.
You can run to me, you can laugh at me or you can walk right out that door.
But I can't be just friends anymore.

Tag.
We can't just be friends anymore.
