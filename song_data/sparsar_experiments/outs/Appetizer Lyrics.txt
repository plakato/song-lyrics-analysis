Appetizer Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


I've been known for killin' and murdering always.
Kill em when I serve em and burn em in all ways.
If they wanna test I be givin' em all A's.
I will put you up in a ditch and your bitch will dig all day.
Fill em full of sickopotumous I recall it.
They find the body its highly obvious ain't no stoppin this.
When im poppin this﻿ niggas droppin and I ain't makin no promises.
But I be all up in em like a was a genachologist.
The lyrical fiend.
Jumpin up over them niggas and puttin their bodies up in the river.
Cause they dont wanna worship a monster.
Not done til I conquer.
Im taking they head off whenever they wanna run up and get they brain split.
bizzankers.
In the nighttime Im puttin in work.
Everyone lookin﻿ at me cus I be puttin em in the dirt.
Hackin away at the feet stabbin the dinner until it hurt.
All hail insane or you will get merked.
Niggas talk wack and they take a cat nap.
One false move and you hearin the blap blap.
You never know when niggas is comin to klack klack.
Thats why I keep a strap in my ghostbusters backpack.
Fuck with me then any time any city it dont matter.
You gon have to fuck with my friends.
The b r a﻿ I n siaiaick go ahead and trip watch them lil homies go in.
16 years old got the brainsick tatted on my arms like yes.
Then 10 years later I was lookin at my face in the mirror thinkin im the best.
Fuck all the﻿ rest, fuck they in my beat and put in the dark....
