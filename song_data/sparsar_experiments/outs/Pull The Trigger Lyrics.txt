Pull The Trigger Lyrics
by Russ.


Pull the trigger 
Ain't, nobody gon na do it for you, 
Pull the trigger 
 
Francesca Frame 
Maybe. You should pull the fucking trigger 
 
Pull the trigger 
Ain't, nobody gon na! Do it for you, 
Pull the trigger 
Don't, hesitate, just shoot, 
 
Yeah. Why you believing the propaganda 
Why, everybody sound like they wan na, be from Atlanta 
Are, you, the voice or the echo 
Are you, the nail or the hammer 
I be talking while chewing my beats. I don't mind my manners. 

I got my doubt at gun point. That'S why I need ransoms 
And, I be handsome. That'S why I got your girl before the money 
Honestly. I thought I'd have 30m's before my twenties 
But, I'm cool with how its happening 
Girl in San Fran, who wants to cross routes with me, 
Like a Yung Colin Kapernick 
Treat the money like a lateral, I'm passing it 
Cause. My family's number one, never put'em number two 
Tryna buy a house in cash. For all the times we had to move 
All the times my mom cried cause. She ain't know what else to do 
All the times she lost hope cause. She ain't know what else to lose 
All the times I shoot shots cause. I don't what else to shoot. 
 
Pull the trigger 
Ain't, nobody gon na. Do it for you, 
Pull the trigger 
Don't, hesitate, just shoot. 
 
I'mma stay winning. I don't believe in luck. 
I believe that life's a buffet better eat it up 
I've seen enough to know that I'm really'bout to blow 
Never felt like an employee, always felt like CEO 
Even. When I stacked shoes, I was never clocked in 
Yeah. I always walked out, but I never walked in 
That's a tribute to my head-space 
And lately. My Devils have been Spanish, chicks in red lace, 
Doing Brujeria on me for ten days, 
More like ten months, but I got out of it 
If I fall in love again. Its probably with a Saudi chick 
But, I keep my head up high and my middle fingers higher 
 
Pull the trigger 
Ain't, nobody gon na do it for you, 
Pull the trigger 
Don't, hesitate just shoot
