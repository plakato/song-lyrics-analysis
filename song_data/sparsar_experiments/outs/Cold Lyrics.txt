Cold Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

Put your hand into my hand.
Put your head against my head.
Put your lips against my lips.
Put self consciousness aside.

No redemption.
No confessions.
No distractions.
No possessions.
Let your blood run through my veins.
Blade shall numb you from the pain.

No tomorrows.
Just submittance.
No remorse of self indulgence.
Just your body.
Just your body.
Just your body.
Just your body.
Just your body on my body.
Want your thoughts of me inside.
Let your hands run on my skin.

Let me be the one you need.
I shall be the one you feed.
All I am and all you see.
Is all I will and ever be.

Invigoration.
Angulation.
Mortal acts of indignation.

Put your lips against my lips.
Put self consciousness aside.

Invigoration.
Angulation.
Mortal acts of indignation.

Put your lips against my lips.
Put self consciousness aside.

Invigoration.
Angulation.
Mortal acts of indignation.

Crave it all.
Know no other.
Crash your dreams and fall forever.
Show me no place you hide behind.
Only body soul entwined.
Let me be the one you need.
I shall be the one you feed.
All I am and all you feel.
All that will and ever be.

Invigoration.
Angulation.
Mortal acts of indignation.

Just your body on my body.
Want your thoughts of me inside.

No redemption.
No confessions.
No distractions.
Or possessions.
No tomorrows.
Just submittance.
No remorse of self indulgence.

Invigoration.
Angulation.
Mortal acts of indignation.

Mortal acts of VNV Nation.
