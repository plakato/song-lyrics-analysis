Follow You Lyrics
by Sway UK.


Where, do I go from here 
Feeling so far from near 
Someone, give me a hand 
A hand to hold 
Someone. Give me a voice to guide me home., Oh 
, 
Plays to her beat he's living in her drum 
And like a harp on her heart strings. He strums 
We're, both in love, are the words she sung 
But, her family ain't hearing her she might as well hum 
She says he's Mr Right. They say he's Mr Wrong 
And. She replies can't we all get along 
And, though she don't agree in the way he makes change. 
She believes he's gon na change and get a job 
He's with his friends, saying ‘Catch them young and their forever yours' 
She's forever indoors. 
She was ready to start Uni 
‘till. He got down on his two knees. 
And made his enemies in-laws 
She's, two weeks, late. The door goes, knock, knock 
Police, take him away. He gets locked up 
He's caught himself, a case. 
She'S bought herself a test and the suspects. The same guy, that's left her
knocked up 
Where. Does she go 
 
When your thoughts start sounding like noise 
You're at the crossroads, trying to make a choice: 
With, no shoulder to cry on 
And. All you have left is a voice. 
 
Where! Do I go from here. 
Feeling so far from near 
Someone, give me a hand 
A hand to hold 
Someone. Give me a voice to guide me home., Oh 
 
You've got to follow you 
You've got to follow. You 
You've got to follow your heart. 
 
You've got to follow. You 
You've got to follow you 
You've got to follow your heart. 
Heart 
 
Life is so short, 
He didn't know his Father and never really talked about it 
Plus. He was brought up well 
So, unless you brought it up well, he never really thought about it. 
Looking at his own kids reminds him: he ain't got no hate 
And. Then he had a strange phone call from a sister that he didn't know existed 
‘Is this some kind of prank ?' 
‘No, wait !', she said 
‘Please, the Father that we share is in a critical condition under care. 
I heard stories about you, and I know it wasn't fair 
But, the fact he wasn't there. It doesn't me he doesn't care' 
He's gon na need a donor at least be assessed. 
He agreed to the test and the results came back 
He's a straight match 
But. Should he take the risk for a stranger that was supposed to play Dad 
Now? Where does he go? 
 
When your thoughts start sounding like noise 
You're at the crossroads, trying to make a choice: 
With, no shoulder to cry on 
And. All you have left is a voice. 
 
Where. Do I go from here 
Feeling so far from near 
Someone, give me a hand 
A hand to hold 
Someone. Give me a voice to guide me home., Oh 
 
You've got to follow. You 
You've got to follow you 
You've got to follow your heart. 
 
You've got to follow you 
You've got to follow. You 
You've got to follow your heart. 
Heart
