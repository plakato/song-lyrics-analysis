Parode Lyrics
by Bodi.


The rain's coming.
Storm's chasin, I'm not running.
I'm not done, and, my head's down.
Gaze on my feet floatin off the ground.
No sound, eyes closed.
Touch now, and I'd be free.
And I'm so tired that I can't sleep.
Look to the sky and die to count sheep, but.
I'm not fallin.
I'm slippin, but, I'm not fallen.
And I can hear the wolves callin.
Factory of shadows, see em all crawlin.
Stand tall in the stars silhouettes.
Hard little breath in these carved whittled steps.
Far from the rest and scarred from the test.
Start to the sunset west, but I'm swept away.
And I can't stay.
But I don't wanna leave, just breathe.
I'll see you in my dreams.
You could have it all if you just believe.
Everything you need is anything that is.
Anything that was is dust the past gives.
Everything's eventual, change is perpetual.
Stained with the fingerprints of ghosts, now your sentinels.
Let it go, I'll be right here.
Always I'll catch you, live with no fear.
And no shadow of a doubt.
With the fire inside you, just let it out.
