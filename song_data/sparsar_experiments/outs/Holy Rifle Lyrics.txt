Holy Rifle Lyrics
by Woop.


Weed in my Swisher, I just need a lighter.
Niggas full of shit, like a baby diaper.
Homie just got hit up by a fucking rifle.
Now it's gunpowder on a Holy Bible.
Live by the gun then you die by the rifle.
If you live by the gun then you die by the rifle.
Live by the gun then you die by the rifle.
If you live by the gun then you die by the rifle.

Real story, put this on the Bible.
I do this every day, I'm a real lifer.
My big homie just got hit up by that fucking rifle.
Niggas wet him up, why'd they baptize him?
Car not in my name, but bitch I pay the title.
You just grabbed some 30s, you can fucking slide them.
Man, I do that shit they rap about, no.
fucking cypher.
They just ? I swear ?
Popping mollies just to last on an all-nighter.
Me and my niggas dressed in black, like some fucking bikers.
We gonna bring them to the room, snatch them off and pipe them.
Man, I do this shit for real, I'm a real lifer.

How many bullets you really gonna toss?
How many shooters this really gonna take?
Surrounded by real and the fake.
Surrounded by love and the hate.
I'm winning the race, I'm real, in the flesh.
These niggas just real in the face.
You're beefing about pussy, that's over a bitch.
You're probably just willing to date.
I hit my knees and I thank Him.
In my bed I swear it's the key.
That chopper go la la la la.
Their families go bye bye bye bye.
I hang with the ra ra ra ra.
Cause Woop he's gonna wet some shit up.
So if you don't live by that gun.
You're probably gonna die by that buck.
My niggas go in for that money.
Some niggas just kill for that cash.
Some niggas just kill for the fame.
Either way I'm just living my last.
That safety go off, that cannon go up.
I look in his face and I blast.
That safety go off, that cannon go up.
I look in his face and I blast.
