Barcelona Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.


The summer sun set a vicious circus
When shadows held the world in place
But. Today I felt a chill
In, my apartment's coolest place
“Fuggi, Regal Fantasima”

The village larks cannot be heard
'cause. All the crows got panderers
I can't escape these velvet drapes
Don't want my rings to fall off. My fingers
“Fuggi Regal Fantasima”

The mirror. I find hard to face

‘Cause. I fear it's a long way down

Got to get away from here
Think. I know which hemisphere
Crazy me don't think. There'S pain in Barcelona
They dance, you'round, a waltz confound

But. I fear it's a long way down
Yes. I fear it's a long way: down
It's cruel

Even. If that straw, I pull
And, I got to fight that. Bull
Nothing really does compare to Barcelona
Besides in Spain Don Juan's to blame

But. I fear it's a long way down
But. I fear it's a long way down
Yes. I fear it's a long way down
And. I fear I won't be around

Got to get away from here
Think. I know which hemisphere
Make sure I have all my papers
Laying out my summer clothes
Search for traps in vain. Like scratching
So, my suitcase I can close

“Fuggi Regal Fantasima”
