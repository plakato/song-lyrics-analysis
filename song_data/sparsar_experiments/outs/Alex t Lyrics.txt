Alex t Lyrics
by Russian Red.

I don't who you are.
Were you live or what you like.
But I try to reach the end.
I don't who you are.
Were you live or what you like.
But I try to reach the end.
Of what you touch and feel.

I saw you once, you look tired.
Lonely player, get in line.
We stepped in silence out of the crowd.
By starring at the week start, the feel.

Oh you're star dreaming your life in my palms.
Oh out of the sky, will I ever wreck your mind?

The sentimental steryothype.
That I dreamed you were designed.
Went to see me at the time you charm me.
The sentimental type of guy that feels.

Oh you're star dreaming your life in my palms.
Oh out of the sky, will I ever wreck your mind?

T... T... T....
