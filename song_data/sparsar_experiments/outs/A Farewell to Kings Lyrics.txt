A Farewell to Kings Lyrics
by Rush.


When they turn the pages of history.
When these days have passed long ago.
Will they read of us with sadness.
For the seeds that we let grow?
We turned our gaze from the castles in the distance.
Eyes cast down on the path of least resistance.

Cities full of hatred, fear and lies.
Withered hearts and cruel, tormented eyes.
Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise.
Beating down the multitude.
and scoffing at the wise.

The hypocrites are slandering.
The sacred halls of Truth.
Ancient nobles showering.
Their bitterness on youth.
Can't we find the minds that made us strong?
Can't we learn to feel what's right and what's wrong?
What's wrong?

Instrumental Break.

Can't we raise our eyes.
And make a start?
Can't we find the minds.
To lead us closer to the Heart?
