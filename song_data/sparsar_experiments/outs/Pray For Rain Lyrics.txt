Pray For Rain Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.


Are you often in a tumble 
Are you careless, like a child 
When, you lost her. Did you smile 
Did, you stumble? Are you wild 
Are, you fading in the shadows, 
Is. It always on your mind. 
When they ask. Do you decline 
Are, you 

Or? Are you cut in two 
Cut all the way through 
Are you cut in two 
Cut all the way through 

Are you, a hot and heavy jungle 
Visions lifted in lace
Was it just a little taste 
Did. You say it to his face: 
Now you're dancing in the shadows
And they're, calling your name
Is it pleasure. Is it pain, 
Did you pray for rain 

Or. Are you cut in two 
Cut all the way through 
Are you cut in two 
Cut all the way through 
Are. You cut in two 
Cut all the way through 
Are you cut in two 
Cut all the way through 
Cut all the way. Through 
Are, you cut, cut, cut, cut 
Cut all the way through 
Are you cut, cut, cut, cut 
Cut all the way through 
Cut all the way through 
Cut all the way through 
Cut all the way through 
Cut all the way through 
Cut all the way through 
Cut. All the way, through 
Cut all the way through
