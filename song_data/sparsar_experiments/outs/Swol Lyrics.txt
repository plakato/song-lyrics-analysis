Swol Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Mouth full of teeth already loosened up by plague and junior high.
Bully for you seedless all the way through his arms and blood warm snout.
After the party he went home and killed everyone on the couch just for being.
home.
Bully for you chased them all the way through his charming heated house.
Lucky guess with forceps.
Boy you've got it what they like to call it, it's a swollen asymmetry.

No love, no love.
For this fucking prescription you scrawled on me.
Grow up growing out at the angles you wished on me.
Help me, if you wanna help me.
You should keep me healthy till its dark.
Thanks for your support.

And you bleed it through.
Every day you do.
Once you've said it straight.
There's no accolade.
