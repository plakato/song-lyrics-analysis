Three Thirty-Nine Lyrics
by Wrekless.


Three thirty-nine a.m. 
Just finished working on the last track of A Daredevil's Dream. 
So, it's a celebration: 
 
Bossy, no guidance, but never will he sell his soul 
Not having it is evil. So the money is the main goal. 
Remain strong in these streets mean muggin' grittin' teeth. 
Tempation is, after you, so compatible within these sheets. 
Money cars, clothes hoes. Damn I want a lot of those 
Don't. You fucking judge me nigga who's, not really shallow, though 
I don't give a fuck. This is me
