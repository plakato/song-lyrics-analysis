It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas Lyrics
by Union J.


It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
Everywhere you go.
Take a look in the Five and Ten.
Glistening once again.
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
Toys in every store.
But the prettiest sight to see.
Is the holly that will be.
On your own front door.

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots.
Is the wish of Barney and Ben.
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk.
Is the hope for Janice and Jen.
And mom and dad can hardly wait.
For school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
Everywhere you go.
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel.
One in the park as well.
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
Soon the bells will start.
And the thing that will make them ring.
Is the carol that you sing.
Right within your heart.

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots.
Is the wish of Barney and Ben.
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk.
Is the hope for Janice and Jen.
And mom and dad can hardly wait.
For school to start again.
