Strolling Beale No. 1 Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

I woke up this mornin'.
Just as blue as I could be.
I woke up this mornin'.
Just as blue as I could be.

I looked all around my bedroom.
My woman had cut out on me.

So I started strollin' and drinkin'.
Strolling Beale Street, up and down.
Strolling Beale Street, up and down, oh, oh.

I enquired about my baby.
But my woman could not be found, oh, no, no.

I saw my baby comin'.
She was comin' with a smile.
She said, I'm comin' home to you, baby.
Comin' home to my baby child.

I, I'll never leave you.
Oh, oh, you know just how I feel.
I'll forever be with you, baby.
So you won't have to keep on strolling Beale.
