Can't Turn Back Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


Seems like yesterday.
I was thinking something so good.
Couldn't come my way.

I was comfortable just sitting.
Being all alone.
But now I know.
I can't ignore what my heart is telling me.

Yeah, I know I'm a little past due.
After all that I've been through.
Break ups and make ups.
And mistakes nd heartaches.
But that ain't you.

I wanna sho' improve.
So whatchu wanna do.
Kissing and hugging and touching.
I ain't gonna lie to you.

I can't turn back now.
Got me in over my head.
I'm in too deep.
Please show me how.
How to love you the way that you need me.

I can't turn back now.
I've come too far witchu, baby.
I can't leave.
So don't let me down.
I wanna follow wherever you lead me.

Honestly, I wouldn't trade a minute.
Of me bein' witchu.
With nothing in the world.
'Cuz when you look at me.
I can't breathe.
Can't nothin ever stop me.
From me lovin' you.

Baby, you are the truth.
You set me free for good.
Teach me, I'm ready.
I'm waiting.
I'm willing to go to school.

I'm so caught up witchu.
I wanna sho' improve.
Whenever, however.
Wherever it takes me.
I'm here to do.

I'm so gone, gone gone.
Look whatchu doing, baby.
You got me no doubt.
I'm so gone, gone gone.

You got me saying.
This is what love is about.
I'm so gone, gone gone.

Look whatchu doing, baby.
You got me no doubt.
I'm so gone, gone gone.
You got me saying.
This is what love is about.
