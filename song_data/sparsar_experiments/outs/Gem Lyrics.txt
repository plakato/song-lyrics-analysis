Gem Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

Cross the road to meet me.
Thought you'd never see.
You opened up my mind so.
I'm waiting to believe.

Audition all emotion.
Never follow doubt.
Show me one direction.
I cannot be without.

Heard enough to reason.
Muted every sense.
Through the interference.
I'm ready to receive.

A glimmer of white promise.
Found in you a gem.
Call my intuition.
I'm ready to believe.

Ready to believe.
Ready to believe.
Ready to believe.
Ready to believe....

I'm ready to believe.
I'm ready to believe.
