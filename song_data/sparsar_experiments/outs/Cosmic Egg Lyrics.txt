Cosmic Egg Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

Walking through the gallery of light.
Say hello to all those wayward eyes.
Light up and cast your fears away.
Look into what you've learned.
How does it feel to have yearned?
The gift that she gave was given to to be given away.
Tell me all of your good reasons, tell me every word you say.
I've given you all of the seasons running through the night and day.
I'm going out of my mind since I've seen you.
Tell me how I got to live this way.
I take a look around this town.
People get up but they don't get down.
Standing on the edge of nowhere.
Tell me all of your good reasons, tell me every word you say.
I've given you all of the seasons running through the night and day.
I'm going out of my mind since I've seen you.
Tell me how I got to live this way.
