School Talk Lyrics
by Yung Kwon.

Chillin' in da library.
School is not my primary.
Mrs. Blindenboker bitchin'.
Cause he stank pussy itchin'.

These carpets are shit.
They smell like shit.
Bout to throw a fit.
Bells bout to ring in a bit.

Ery one's playin games.
I don't play no games.
I ball like Lebron James.
No I don't.

Dis school sucks dick.
I poke it with a stick.
All day.
Ery day.
