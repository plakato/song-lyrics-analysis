Curious serge Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

You were 23 and dying alone.
Jealous lovers, selling off the loan.
Taunting me with every little goodbye.
Begging me to touch you, touch you all night.

It gets better, oh it gets better, it gets betterâ€¦

then you showed me you're not for me.
with your style, with your smile.
trippin over the same bad dreams.
I can't believe you're all mine.

Wind is blowin out.
Bows creak, moving to the south.
Time is running out.
Seasons tease, rushing in and out.

then you showed me you're not for me.
with your style, with your smile.
trippin over the same bad dreams.
I can't believe you're all mine.

You're looking through me.
