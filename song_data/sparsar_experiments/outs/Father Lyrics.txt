Father Lyrics
by VI Seconds.


I guess I got a confession: 
I got daddy issues, 
In the sense of him not being here; 
Go figure, right, 
I! Guess I'm a statistic: 
But fuck it what a better time to tell him how I feel about him, 
Than on my debut 
So. If your listening, 
Listen 
 
Dear Father 
What the fuck's, the matter with you 
Was Mother, not good enough, was I a fucking issue, 
You begged for her to have me crying into tissues 
Now. Here I am nigga, you gone and I don't miss you 
Why 
Cause. You were people that were inside your life, 
But, you were never here, and so you never get that right. 
See! You never took a moment to teach me how to be a man 
And. Yet you not being around is what made me into a man. 
The irony is murder, but I'll show you no gratitude. 
Cause mother was the only one to deal with my attitude. 
See mothers, love and cherish you. Fathers show discipline. 
But Mother was all I had when I'd scream. She was listening, 
Listen nigga. I met you once and I hated it. 
It was graduation. You missed. I live to replenish it 
Ain't this some shit. I wanted to save this for a while 
I hope they cut your balls off. So this don't happen to another child 
 
Dear, Father, 
I'm gon', make you wish you took the time 
To, do your job as a man and stay a part of my life, 
Dear, Father, 
I'm gon', make sure you regret the day. 
You chose you didn't, want me and chose to walk away. 
Cause I'm grown now and doing it 
Better than you ever did. 
And me being like you is something I never will 
Live with it 
Live with it, 
 
Live, with it 
Live with it 
 
Live with it 
 
Do. You know how it feels to see your mother struggle. 
Bills coming meals needed got her puzzled 
Do. You know how it feels to see her always shedding tears, 
Cause a man she once loved left her with a child and fears 
Worried about survival, how to reward my grades 
But as a child. All these things never crossed my brain 
Cause. She wore a smile on her face and always made it happen, 
And for that I'll give her the world, but as for you, Father, I'm snapping 
Not a call or check up to see how your seeds doing 
But when I blow up. If you call I'mma see through it, 
There would be a rare moment where and you'd yell at the top of yours
lungs, how heartbreaking slow 
You'd hang up on my mother without a care'bout, how she feels 
And, the more I think about it. I just wan na grip. The steel 
But, you ain't worth the ammunition, you ain't worth the trigger finger or the
fetal position. 
 
Dear, Father, 
I'm, gon', make you wish you took the time. 
To, do your job as a man and stay a part of my life. 
Dear, Father, 
I'm gon'. Make sure you regret the day 
You chose you didn't, want me and chose to walk away. 
Cause I'm grown now and doing it 
Better than you ever did. 
And me being like you is something I never will 
Live with it 
Live with it. 
 
Live, with it 
Live with it 
 
Live, with it 
, 
I, love, thy, Mother and Father Lord, you can hold 
Me accountable cause, it's something I don't condone 
I'm, not one to honor a man who don't deserve it. 
And mine, just ain't worth it in reality. He'S worthless 
See! My Lord, I understand he's my parent, but he ain't act it. He was just my
transport to this planet. 
Dear Lord 
He walked out on my Mother, so beautiful so fuck that nigga, I won't be at his
funeral 
Dear Lord 
As. Far as I'm concerned you're the only Father I got 
Cause his spot wasn't earned 
And it burns. But it's bitter-sweet: 
I've learned life, lessons from falling on my face without a man in my section, 
Just Mother, oh Mother, and my stance on these feet. 
Each beef done with I survived from these streets, 
Fully grown and raw with a talent. That'S well done. 
The seed turned to a better tree than it fell from 
 
Dear Father 
I'm gon' make you wish you took the time 
To, do your job as a man and stay a part of my life, 
Dear, Father, 
I'm gon', make sure you regret the day. 
You chose you didn't, want me and chose to walk away, 
Cause I'm grown now and doing it 
Better than you ever did. 
And me being like you is something I never will 
Live with it 
Live with it, 
 
Live, with it 
Live with it 
Live with it. 
 
Yeah me 
You one to dig 
Love you Moms 
*kiss* 
Had to get that off. My chest
