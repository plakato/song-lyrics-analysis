Mike Jones 
I hit the road for bankrolls, don't hit it for stank. Hoes 
I hit it for that currency. Don'T need a hoe burning me 
Don't need a hoe. Hugging me cause my paper loving me 
I! Do this shit for cash and do'? Not for fame and flashy hoes 
I work, hard pray and grind. That'S why I shine all the time. 
I bleed the block and put it down until the day I'm falling down 
I use to serve a lot of fiends. All about that dollar green 
Now. I got ta jump out of the game to pursue my dreams - 
And, that's in this rap game, so I left the crack game 
Trying to keep it legal hoping one day, I'ma stack, mayn, 
Don't wan na go back man, but I will go back in fact. 
I'Ll hit the block with crack whenever paper slack mayn 
I'm up on the grind cause, I'm trying to put it down 
So, I'm day to day grinding, hoping day to day shining 
I'm up on the grind cause, I'm trying to put it down 
So, I'm day to Day grinding, hoping day to day shining 
, 
Rule 1 fuck a hoe and put first your funds. 
Rule 2, never leave home without your gun. 
Rule 3. Keep on your mind: currency, 
Rule, 4 grind and you gon shine fa, sho, 
, 
Mz., Trinity, 
Forget. What y'all say? I hustle all day 
3-65 a day, I'm out to make pay 
What better way in some jeans and boots, I'm still cute 
Whether, I'm robbing or taking money. It'S still loot, 
I studied the rules, move with ambition 
Listen to what I'm spitting this, the illest shit, written, 
Never, trust, friend or foe. Only trust my intuition 
Niggas get my attention. Try to knock me off my mission 
But. My passion for this game done turned me to a animal 
If. You ain't talking scrilla, then nigga. We ain't compatible, 
That's rule number, one nigga don't play dumb, nigga 
'Fore. I go to rule two and pull out that gun. Nigga 
Rule three sounds cool with me. 
Cause, currently I got my mind on currency 
Trinity's. No, lady luck, but this lady's got lots of luck. 
A Milwaukee basketball team, I'm all about Bucks, biatch, 
, 
Paul Wall 
I got my mind on my money and I'm ready to mash 
My number one task cause on the grind: getting that cash 
A lot of people mad cause. We made it to the top fast 
And knocked em out of they position now they coming in last 
I stay on my note, I'm on my grind at all times, 
I focus my mind now, I'm out here getting what's mine: 
I keep God over money, put money Over everything else, 
All by myself accumulating this wealth 
I. Never ever let a heffer come between me and my cheddar 
I'm, a trend, setter and y'all should know better 
I'm, quite clever when I'm stacking, my bread, 
Many ways to get paid till the day that I'm dead 
Even when I'm macking. Instead, in back of my head 
I'm thinking bout coming about beating the drought, 
No doubt I'm in it to win it, I ain't gon lose 
I, ain't, no fool! I keep cool and follow the rules. 
 
I'm just saying though..
