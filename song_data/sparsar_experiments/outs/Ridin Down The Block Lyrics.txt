Ridin Down The Block Lyrics
by Yung Nate.

Riding down the block like what else should a brother do? 
It'S Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat, might … you 
Rolling down my window G. I have an air conditioner 
What. I got the sound. I want the whole world to listen to 
Riding down the block like what else should a brother do 
It's Saturday, it's Saturday the heat, might … you 
Rolling down my window G. I have an air conditioner 
What. I got the sound. I want the whole world to listen to 
 
Homie, I'm fine, I'm goodie good, 
Packet, full of dreams, I'm still in the hood 
Shawty you fine, fine, I'm feeling the love 
Smoke in here rose in the cups, 
Oh news that will make daily word to my mom 
So never have to hold my tongue … worst than the 
Money over everything the words of my all 
Come to big slice speakers. They be bumping in cars 
Caught a bit for my dog. It'S got away from the charge, 
No more maggots fuck the … babies. Now it's just … 
Don't confuse my confidence with arrogance. Dawg 
Middle finger to the law got my stereo won 
I heard they killed Vince, but I'ma carry them on 
Dog, eat dog word, but I'ma share him a bone 
My. … on my sleep and I'm wearing it home 
But, I hope the beat not here in the zone. 
 
Riding down the block like what else should a brother do? 
It'S Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat, might … you 
Rolling down my window G. I have an air conditioner 
What. I got the sound. I want the whole world to listen to 
Riding down the block like what else should a brother do 
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat, might … you 
Rolling down my window G. I have an air conditioner 
What. I got the sound. I want the whole world to listen to 
 
Homie, I'm fine, I'm goodie good, 
Packet, full of dreams, I'm still in the hood 
Shawty you fine, fine, I'm feeling the love 
Smoke in here rose in the cups. 
It ain't, the play you .... Unless you play in the truck 
Get, some myself and nothing ain't making enough 
Shawty make that ass. … you ain't shaking it enough 
Yeah! You got a nigger rock, but you ain't making it come 
Tell a role whether when I like it favorite duck 
It's in the hood, no fire. I was blazing it up. 
Already put work. Now, I'm double enough. 
They ain't fucking with us. They just fucking it up. 
I'M with a couple of bros, they accompany us 
For a couple of hours, but don't get confi with us. 
I just came for your guts. I ain't keeping in love 
And. If it ain't trust funds. I ain't keeping the trust, 
 
Riding down the block like what else should a brother do 
It's Saturday, it's Saturday the heat, might … you 
Rolling down my window G. I have an air conditioner 
What. I got the sound. I want the whole world to listen to. 
Riding down the block like what else should a brother do? 
It'S Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat, might … you 
Rolling down my window G. I have an air conditioner 
What. I got the sound. I want the whole world to listen to 
Riding down the block. Then let me see you put your hands up up up up up 
Riding down the block. Then let me see you put your hands up up up up up 
Riding down the block. Then let me see you put your hands up up up up up 
Up up up up up up up, then let me see you put your hands up up up up. 
Up up up up up
