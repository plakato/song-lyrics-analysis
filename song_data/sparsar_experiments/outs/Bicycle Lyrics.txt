Bicycle Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

My bicycle rode so smooth.
Under the clouds.
Over the stars.
All of you can eat my dust.

My bicycle rode so smooth.
Under the clouds.
Over the stars.
All of you can eat my dust.

Can I start with a goodbye.
You are very busy.
Visions that are holding.
That wretched light.
Disassociated by.
Combinations that were ill advised.
And a dosage quite unwise.

My bicycle rode so smooth.
Under the clouds.
Over the stars.
All of you can eat my dirt.

My bicycle rode so smooth.
Under the clouds.
Over the stars.
All of you can eat my dirt.

Oh we cut you down to size.
What a difference between what I saw.
And what was before my eyes.
Was it great, no disease.
That will get you taken by.
A squad car right to the a&amp;e.

My bicycle rode so smooth.
Under the clouds.
Over the stars.
All of you can eat my dust.

Lalalalalalalalalala.

My bicycle rode so smooth.
Under the clouds.
Over the stars.
All of you can eat my dust.

My bicycle rode so smooth.
Under the clouds.
Over the stars.
All of you can eat my dust.
