Anastasia Lyrics
by Voltaire.

There's a field of flowers and they smell like you.
And I go walking through them when I feel you remember me.
You know I'd love to pick one for my lapel, but you know.
There are too many insects watching.
I'm afraid they'd tell on me.

And here the skies are neither day nor night.
In this place where I close my eyes.
It's like my skin would try so hard to hold it back.
There's an explosion, it comes raining down.
You smiled, you smiled at me.

Anastasia.
Your disappearance is the thorn in my side.
Anastasia.
You know your absence is the thorn in my side.

I think about you every night and every day.
Every moment since you left here.
You were the one that got away as they say.
Everyone has an Anastasia.

Anastasia.

Your disappearance is the thorn in my side.
Anastasia.

You know your absence is the thorn in my side.

I kept your room just how you left it.
There's not a toy out of place.
Just in case the fates are kind and you come back someday.
I don't want to live without my little Anastasia.

Anastasia.

Your disappearance is the thorn in my side.
Little Anastasia.

You know your absence is the thorn in my side.

Little Anastasia.

Your disappearance is the thorn in my side.
Little Anastasia.

And only you can take the thorn from my side.
