Heroes Lyrics
by The Virus.

One time my father said to me.
When you grow up, you be the best man you can be.
When I look back on how fucked up my life has gone.
He said, Well son that's the thing that will make you strong.

I never said that I knew what was right or wrong.
Because all my heroes are long gone.

There's no heroes any more.

One time, One cry.
No heroes, No more.
All of this time I had been wrong.

I see a man there on TV.
With lots of fame, lots of pride, lots of money.
He probably hates his wife He probably beats his kids.
He'll never have respect for all the things he did.

I never said that I knew what was right or wrong.
Because all my heroes are long gone.
And no one ever told me just what I should be.
All I ever had was me.
