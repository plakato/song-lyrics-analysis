Pulchra Lyrics
by Tyler Luke.


I feel like Ian Curtis in May, hanging on my own mind.
I feel like Joaquin Phoenix, can't figure out my own signs.
I feel like bonvin in 86 or Christ on the crucifix.
Trade my Volvo for a hearse and crash on Route 66.
Look out, reality is coming around to summon you now.
And you think you're yelling loud but no one is hearing your sound.
Even the people that believe in fate.
Still look both ways.
Those who worship a god still fear their last day.
Taking over the Egyptian military.
Blood stained memories.
Filibustering the system with my rhymes and my melodies.
Is this what it's like to live in the paranoid mind like this.
The super ego died and my ego only does whatever the id is.
Walking, pondering, prowling finding what the meaning of life is.
Respecting and reminiscing what the remnants of my life is.
Walter freeman follows me, lobotomy my artery.
Ice picks in my eyes, conscious with a thousand eyes on me.
Scientology folly flooding through the mind of maverick.
She won't call me so I'm wish on shooting asterisks.
Reciting Figaro, memorized by the bass line of Accordion.
I have even more wax than the parents of Lizzie Borden.
