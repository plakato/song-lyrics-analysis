Lay the Hands Lyrics
by Univore.

This is the part.
That I dreamt about.
This is the part that I have dreamt about.

This is the time.
That we start to shine.
This is the time that we must start to shine.

We almost took the chance to compromise.
There's a time to fantasize.
And I put my third eye on the prize.

Let's lay the hands.
Let's lay the hands.

Let's lay the hands.
Let's do it again.

I can't choose to believe.
And I can't believe to choose.
I don't know what to do.

I need more information.
I need more information.
I don't know what to do.

Can't trust this planet.
Can't trust this planet.
Can't trust this.

I can't choose to believe.
And I can't believe to choose.
I don't know what to do.

Lay the hands.

This is our chance.
To dance the dance.
This is our chance to dance the ancient dance.

This is the place.
We come face to face.
We come face to face with the human race.

We all must take a vow just once in life.
It's a time for sacrifice.
It's our time to have our paradise.

Let's lay the hands.
Let's lay the hands.

Let's lay the hands.
Let's do it again.

I can't choose to believe.
And I can't believe to choose.
I don't know what to do.

I need more information.
I need more information.
I don't know what to do.

Can't trust this planet.
Can't trust this planet.
Can't trust this.

I can't choose to believe.
And I can't believe to choose.
I don't know what to do.
