Lane 2 Lane Lyrics
by Yungstar.


Swangin lane 2 lane in a dropper 
On the count of 3 
Southside roll choppers, 
 
Me and James on jane, as I swang down Main 
Lane 2 lane, music, bang residentials, complain, 
Some say it's a shame. I'M grippin' to much grain 
Candy stains on both lanes. Like a wet airplane, 
Speed limit 45, what that mean to me 
I'ma skate like Grezky, doin', 183 
On, the strech hard to catch I'ma circle, da' block 
Second time around your corner, I'm recline da' top 
Screens drop trucks, pop do's, lock, Glock cocked. Next, stop at IHOP, 
We swang drop bottoms flop, 
MAKE IT HOT MAKE IT HOT is what da kids be yellin' 
Candies reds dey be dredin' pounds of smoke, I'm in heaven, 
I'm supreme by any means hovercraft with seven screens, 
20 inches cutting sharper den the crease. In my jeans, 
Car hoppers chase choppers write my name across dey lockers, 
Wood popper. You should. I won't stop for these boppers. We roll 
 
Lane 2 lane in the dropper stretch, Excursions on choppers 
Helicopters, with minacas different boppers, who knock us 
Truck, poppers top droppers. We TYP 
What, you see, I see the 1-2-3 do with me: 
I creep smoke a tree: TV'S DVD'S, 
Burban', swearvin, down da' street Flex, fallin in da 
From 2PSP fitin' to wreck the industry. 
 to the T feel me who I be LIL': JAMES 
Grabin' grain, switchin' lanes down Main 
People complain cause I swang with screens fallin' like rain 
Slightly, cracked trunk open if I'm choppin' or postin' 
Paint soakin down da' beltway, as I tossin' and toakin' coastin' 
Sippin'. Potion ain't no braggin' or boastin' 
Dey jokein', while I'm postin' wit' my yacht on da' ocean 
If, its hoops or coupes. We let the trunk sake, loose, 
Hot juice, show proof and gently raise da' roof. 
 
Swangin, lane 2 lane with my hands against da' grain 
Workin'. My wood wheel, when I swang and bang 
CD's change,
