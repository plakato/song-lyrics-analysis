Belispeak II Lyrics
by Purity Ring.

Purity Ring
Grandma, the water is rising
My. Boundless hair has gotten green
I'll, be your swimming forest island
Bid. You walk safely safely over me

Danny Brown
Raised in the gutter. I ain't really had nothin'
No silver spoon. I was raised a rusty shovel
Granny used to tell me boy stay up: outta trouble
But, the hunger in my tummy had me stayin' on my hustle

When, I'm livin' in a bottle with my head, all cloudy
Stomach rumbling like a thunderstorm up in Maui
Pray over me, and I'm hoping that I make it
Like a last dollar in a slot machine in Las Vegas

Need. Good luck stay trusting my gut
If, they can't hold me down, then you hold me up
Trapped in the lies, then nobody I could trust
I'd give it all away before I give it all. Up

Now tell me: have you ever ever ever in your life
Hear something wrong, and you know it wasn't right
Now you're up late night thinking that night
All along sorry know it wasn't right

Same sense again. Tell me, would you think twice
I did that yesterday put it on my life
Once a day passed? Would a feelin' never last
While? I flick away my problems with the cigarette ash

Stayin' up late. I could never ever sleep
Feelin' all my hunger every time my belly speak
Stayin' up late. I could never ever sleep
Feelin' all my hunger every time my belly speak

Purity Ring
Grandma, the water is rising
My. Boundless hair has gotten green
I'll, be your swimming forest island
Bid. You walk safely safely over me

Grandma. My sleep is narrow
Bid. You bring me some strong drink
Strain out the pulps and set them close outside
For when my belly
For, when my little belly speaks

Grandma there's air beneath my bed
And. It whispers
And it whispers when I rest
Bid hem the skirts in salt and vinegar vinegar
And hover closely
Hover closely under head

Danny Brown
Stayin' up late. I could never ever sleep
Feelin' all my hunger every time my belly speak
Stayin' up late. I could never ever sleep
Feelin' all my hunger every time. My belly speak

Purity Ring
Grandma I've been unruly
In my dreams
And with my speech
Drill little holes into my eyelids
That. I might see you

Grandma the water is rising
My. Boundless hair has gotten green
I'll, be your swimming forest island
Bid. You walk safely safely over me
