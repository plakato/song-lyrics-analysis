Hollywood Hiatus Lyrics
by U-N-I.


Cool it now 
Slow it Down 
 
They, better cool. It now 
Got more reason to act. Foolish now 
Your broad is like we goin' do this now 
Says she just wan na taste, my style 
 
She knows Im sicker than crew 
More thicker than you 
Tryin' to bicker and fight 
And. Compare to us in real life like 
NO, 
U-N-I crew. We fly like bullets on strays, 
Which yo main you better, get low, 
It's hard to enjoy life like I do, 
With more drank in my cup mix. It up 
With the brown skin chick with good hur 
Tell her. She can park that ass right, hur 
So fuck beef dog, what you mad fo', 
About, good music and the cash flow 
Flow 51-50 and a 59-50 fitted like 50 
 
Look to the sky. 
Get, the dough up 
Need the whip with the doors that raise up 
Hollywood Hiatus ... Thumbs up to the haters 
 
We want the models that pop bottles 
So trace the steps. Now you can follow 
Hollywood Hiatus 
Thumbs up to the haters 
 
They, better cool it. Now, 
Got more reason to act. Foolish now, 
Your broad is like we goin' do this now 
Says she just wan na taste, my style 
 
Wow 
It go Yonas. Yannick Roblvd hur 
With fly girls on my hip, like the phone that chirp 
We, that popular ... 
Fake posers tryina copy us, ..., 
Say Hi to the guy 
I, don't need a wife 
So. I rotate em with the big hand, goin clockwise 
And. It'S a quarter. Past 2, 
Im 15 minutes over, while Im hangin with you 
Used to be a fan of heels 
Now with sneaker play kicks with chicks that are ill. 
So, don't cry here! Go a couple of change! 
Buy, a Coke! Maybe that'll bring a smile, 
 
Look to the sky, 
Get the dough up, 
Need the whip with the doors that raise up 
Hollywood, Hiatus ... Thumbs up to the haters 
 
We want the models that pop bottles 
So trace the steps. Now you can follow. 
Hollywood Hiatus 
Thumbs up to the haters 
 
 Y-O
