D.O.N.E. Lyrics
by Yung ELi.


We ain't even worried bout them nigahs tho.
We ain't even worried we tryna get this dough.
We ain't even worried kuz we smokin dope.
Tryna swim in fckin money and have a nigah float.
Its done its done its done its d.o.n.e.
Its done its done its done its d.o.n.e.
Its done its done its done its d.o.n.e.
Wen it said and done my day one nigahs eat.

Ridin wit my nigahs travlin wit my fckin team.
Out here tryna get it neva sleep but we chasin dreams.
Smokin raw papers but we like our paper green.
Gota get the money kuz kash rule everything.
Grindin everyday kuz we tryna live rite.
Smokin for the stress we just tryna live life.
Tell em the haters that we komin so they sit tight.
Talkin like bitches so I guess that these nigahs dikes.
Best believe we ain't worried bout them nigahs tho.
We the top klass they first floor them nigahs slow.
They ain't chasin money kuz they busy lovin hoes.
Thats them type of nigahs who don't mind sharing klothes.
I want the dough kuz ain't no joke.
Wen a nigah feelin broke.
Got a nigah feelin low.
So I get high n roll that dope.
Puffin on the realest smoke.
Gota nigah lookin ghost.
But a nigah in his zone.

Its done its done its done I swear its done.
I'm bouta bring that heat like I kontrol the sun.
In the stu kookin up with my day ones.
That's who ima eat wit wen our day komes.
Wen we on the scene it be lit shit.
Fckin wit my nigahs u a dip shit.
Have u on a shirt on some rip shit.
That go for all my nigahs we tryna get rich.
Fck a hater wen u tryna get ya bread up.
Fck a hoe unless u tryna get ya head up.
Kant love em tho I swear that pussy will get u set up.
If my nigahs talkin krzy ima tell em shutup.
Gotta focus nigah kuz there ain't no room for error.
If u know better than u gota do better.
By any means nigah I'm talkin bout in any fckin weather.
Kuz noones knows wen we leavin on that stretcher.
