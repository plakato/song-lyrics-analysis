On Wounded Knee Lyrics
by Wrinkle Neck Mules.

Back of the napkin scratch out.
The words that I've learned.
But they don't come, just cracks and hums.
Like nothing I've ever heard.
No place to stay, no fire or rain.
No number or ratio.
No gauge to give a warning sign.

I guess we all should have known.
What the downside might be.
As we swore and prayed and stood and gazed.
At some beast we never did see.
Coming winter's chill in Charlottesville.
With no leg to stand on.
That's about where I draw the line.

Scrape off the time elapse.
Push myself right up to the collapse.
Will you know me when I'm down on wounded knee?

Well the blood ran down and covered up.
Everyone I've ever known.
Mangled hands and best laid plans.
My my haven't we grown.
Back to the mirrors where we can't hear.
The screams and shouts below.
I tell you boys it's about time.

There are high towers and deep wells.
There are strokes and heart attacks and spells.
Will you know me when I'm down on wounded knee?
