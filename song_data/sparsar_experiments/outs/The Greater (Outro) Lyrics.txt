The Greater (Outro) Lyrics
by Zip K..


I say high was we what got the fuckin shit on.
Versace silk imported what I sit on.
I know them hoes gone love me when I get on.
But all them hoes Imma tell um get on.
I don't even remember you.
Imma get my forget on.
I wouldn't even waste my battery.
To pick up on your phone calls up.
I gotta check what my percent on.
Cause when it's hard to love me.
You be quick getcha quit on.
But once I catch fire just to.
Oven mit on.
All my haters Imma shit on.
In the new Gianni fit on.
Sticky icky gettin lit on.
Nappy pappy with the shit holmes.

Tryna get that Rollie Rollie Rollie x2.
On my wrist wrist wrist.
Champagne smoke.
Hold squad dope.
East side shit.
Yeah yeah yeah.
I know you know you know you.
Tired of talkin bout this rich nigga shit.
Nah nah nah.
I want all that.
That's my shit yeah yeah yeah.

Rollie Rollie Rollie down moreland roll the oz.
Tell my shawty roll the oz.
Keep an eye out for the police.
Garner their intentions.
Eric Garner their intentions.
I'm just tryna get high.
I ain't tryna rest in peace.
Tryna get a piece of the pie not the puzzle.
All my dogs down to ride no leash no muzzle.
Made a homicide ever since my partna died.
I been workin on the shit that's triple not double.
Dodging all the gold digging broads and trouble.
Make it off the humble.
Do it cause I loved it.
Hate you when you up when you down man they love you.
I'm tryna get some bucks like Milwaukee muhfucka.
Tryna get a buzz building lobby muhfucka.
Coulda fell off like a lotta muhfuckas.
But I ain't gone stop hell nah muhfucka.
Imma give my all muhfucka.

Aye.
Move a hunned grams.
Credit card scams.
Get me out the jam.
Strapped and all that.
We did all that aye.
Pussy nigga fall back.
Two9 skully.
RIP ya closet.
Bet her pussy run a faucet.
But I prolly shouldn't force it.
But I prolly never forfeit.
All my brogod bosses.
We don't ever do no talkin.
You know losing's not an option.
Shit, it's been heavy on my conscience.
Now the foreign whippers drip with different glosses.
Saks fifth shoppin no more hittin Ross's.
Pray to gawd it make a hatin nigga nauseous.
