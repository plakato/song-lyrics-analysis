Dreamer Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

I've forgotten who I am.
Afraid that it's too late.
Was I wrong?
Was there hope all along?

Can't remember when I felt alive.
Illusions took hold.
Lost myself but worse than anything.
I woke up on my own.
I remember thinking of impossible things.
Of never backing down to impossibilities.

Dreamer.
Where have you gone.
Dreamer.
Will you live on.
Dreamer.

Dreamer come home.

There's nothing left but emptiness, when you realise what you could have been.
Kept searching for the right moment.
When you just have to live in it.
You just have to live in it!

Dreamer.
Where have you gone.
Dreamer.
Will you live on.
Dreamer.

Dreamer come home.
