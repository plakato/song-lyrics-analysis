Thunder Lyrics
by Zodiac.

She got in my veins baby, she got in my soul oh no.
Packing my bags I'm ready, ready to go.
We just come naturally, won't you understand.
We just come naturally, won't you take my hand.
I can seem to let it go, I can seem to slow it down.
I can seem to let it go, thunder in my machine!
Destination ain't no hesitation to show who I am.
Color blinds this garden, I must come in.
We just come naturally, won't you understand.
We just come naturally, won't you take my hand.
I can seem to let it go, I can seem to slow it down.
I can seem to let it go, thunder in my machine!
I can seem to let it go, I can seem to slow it down.
I can seem to let it go, thunder in my machine!
Things may have..., things may have changed.
But their memories might drop you insane.
We just come naturally, won't you understand.
We just come naturally, won't you take my hand.
I can seem to let it go, I can seem to slow it down.
I can seem to let it go, thunder in my machine!
I can seem to let it go, I can seem to slow it down.
I can seem to let it go, thunder in my machine!
Thunder, thunder in my machine!
Thunder, thunder in my machine!
