Aaa

Shake, some for a lil bit. 
A 
STOP.Now, make it pause like a stop. Sign. 
Twerk, some 
Shake, some for a lil bit 
Stop., Now make it pause like a stop sign. 
 
UH 
Got the fans pepped up like a rally 
Time to head out to the club 
Leave the kids with they daddy 
Get the Pinto, get the hoopie bettah' hop inside a caddy 
If it got fours wheels. Then it better ride. Pass me 
Hat game, tight, 
Shoe game, tight Ya, it's Yung King 
Im, about to rip the mic 
Ya I stay ready to party You ain't even got ta. Ask me 
Make that that thang' drop, like my ex left, a $ $ cheek 
Y-U-N-G-K-I-N-G. Why do you keep on hatin' 
Even when I fall Im get back up, keep goin' like I'm skating 
Ya. They waitin' on the mixtape but tell the truth: 
That Sh # t ain't ready yet 
Hat on my head tie in my back pocket 
Go ask them girls to 
 
Twerk some 
Shake, some for a lil bit. 
A 
STOP 
Now make it pause like a stop. Sign. 
Twerk some 
Shake, some for a lil bit 
Stop. Now make it pause like a stop sign. 
 
Twerk, some 
Shake, some for a lil bit. 
A 
STOP 
Now, make it pause like a stop. Sign. 
Twerk some 
Shake, some for a lil bit 
Stop. Now make it pause like a stop sign. 
 
Twerk, some 
Shake, some for a lil bit. 
A 
STOP 
Now, make it pause like a stop. Sign.
