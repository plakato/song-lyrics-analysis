Asmodeus Lyrics
by Unkown.


He is trying to own me.
But now he does not know me.
They say that he is the worst.

I do not let him to speak.
I am ready for my peak.

Mit MJ Rips.
I know this demon known as Asmodues.
Years of fighting sin now I am freaking pissed.
Started in the seventh grade.
When I had finally made.
The decision to try and open my mind.
To a different kind of entertainment.
Doing things I wouldn't do in my basement.
Falling over myself like bowling pins.
So now there are seven different sins.
I fall under many of them.
It seems like I will be condemn.
For my actions that I confess daily.
Being beaten by my sins like Bailey.
I sorry God for tonight.
But I was going alright.
This my confession I write.

Mit MJ Rips.
Thinking of the Christian era.
I'm thinking of dating Sarah.
The one from the book of Tobit.
As I continue to damn spit.
Tonight is my wedding night.
But once I turn off my light.
The demon's ready to kill.
Everything has gone downhill.
I descended into the depths of Hell.
I'm in the second ring as people yell.
People are being thrown around.
No longer able to sleep sound.
Take me out of this hell.
Grab my hand Raphael.
I need to thank you when you do.
I will be nothing without you.

Mit MJ Rips.
Now I hate the water and doves.
Because they remind me of love.
Because I have disappointed him.
That is why I change my name to dim.
Now I will be in Hell like Dante.
So now what more can I freaking say?
Remember the song Another Day.
Where I had addressed other Christians.
For omitting and committing sins.
I'm no better than anyone.
I am depressed from what I done.
That is why I released the new Relapse album.
My emotions and actions caused me to be numb.
Never thought that I could make a rap about God.
Was never able to make a song it felt odd.
Asmodues is carrying me in a pod.

Mit MJ Rips.
So there is a change in story.
Now I am in Purgatory.
In the distance is a brothel.
The new temptation is awful.
They pull me back in.
To a world of sin.
At the front desk is the evil demon.
As I hear a couple hot girls screaming.
So I walk and check through the peephole.
After seeing them, I have one goal.
As I try and open the door.
So I could see a little more.
So God how long can I stay here.
Stuck in my addiction and I fear.
That I will never see your face.
My life since now is a disgrace.
