Worried (Glory Music) Lyrics
by Yung ELi.


I move in silence, they don't think I'm doing shit.
Well, I fooled you bitch, fuck I care â€˜bout your two cents.
Don't excuses my french it's how I feel fuck your feelings.
And I ain't givin' in, I'm going in until I win.
People always talk, it's hard to always walk.
So you whip their ass like Peter put them into Park.
Only top they wanna see you is behind them bars.
Grandma said when I was young , you'd better go get yours.

I hate it when they tell me what to do.
Like they took steps in my shoes.
Like they see things from my view.
They's gon' always doubt a nigga, and that i always knew.
They be thinking that I'm new.
Like I wasn't born in 92.
I stay rollin' up a doob.
I stay smokin' like I'm snoop.
I stay fighting like our troops.
Tryna ride up in a coop.
While they want you in the roof.
That's why I stay up in the stew.
Fuck whoever that assume.
Watch me shit on you!

Please don't show me love when I reach the glory.
As if I wasn't on my own this whole journey.
Please don't show me love when I'm being buried.
As if I wasn't on my own this whole journey.
But why you worried.
Why you worried.
As if I wasn't on my own this whole journey.
But why you worried.
Why you worried.

Don't get mad at me cause your dream's broken.
We are not the same, when will you notice?
I'm soo focused, my mind is open.
In my zone from the bull shit when I'm smokin'.
Life is crazy, when I say it I'm not joking.
It's a cold world I swear my heart is frozen.
But I say fuck it and I just keep rollin'.
When I can't hear you then you now it's potent.
Right now they just boosting like that's gonna stop my motion.
Yeah, I know you fucking hoping just as hard as I am going.
When you see me toasting, please don't join the wave.
Jump into ocean let me have my fucking moment.
I'm still fighting with my knuckles swollen.
Always saying I don't give a fuck, but it's not my slogan.
Like I lost the motion I don't give a fuck.
And I always say it, but it's not my slogan.

Please don't show me love when I reach the glory.
As if I wasn't on my own this whole journey.
Please don't show me love when I'm being buried.
As if I wasn't on my own this whole journey.
But why you worried.
Why you worried.
As if I wasn't on my own this whole journey.
But why you worried.
Why you worried.
