Under The Blade Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

UNDER THE BLADE.

A glint of steel, a flash of light.
You know you're not going home tonight.
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind.
Nowhere to run, everywhere you'll find.
You can't escape from the bed you've made.
When your time has come.
You'll accept the blade!

You're cornered in the alley way.
You know you're not alone.
You know it's gonna end this way.
The chill goes to the bone.
Now here it comes that glistening light.
It goes into your side.
The blackness comes, tonight's the night.
The blade is gonna ride.

Cause you're under the blade.
Oh --.
You're under the blade.

It's not another party head.
This time you cannot rise.
Your hands are tied, your legs are strapped.
A light shines in your eyes.
You faintly see a razor's edge.
You open your mouth to cry.
You know you can't, it's over now.
The blade is gonna ride.

Cause you're under the blade.
Oh.
You're under the blade.

A glint of steel, a flash of light.
You know you're not going home tonight.
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind.
Nowhere to run, anywhere you'll find.
You can't escape from the bed you've made.
When your time has come.
You'll accept the blade!

You've tried to make it to the front.
You're pinned against the side.
A monster stands before you now.
Its mouth is open wide.
The lights go on, the night explodes.
It tears into your mind.
When the night does end, you'll come again.
The blade is gonna ride.

Cause you're under the blade.
Oh.
Under the blade.

Here it comes, baby ....
Oww.
