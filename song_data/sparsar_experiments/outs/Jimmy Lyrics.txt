Jimmy Lyrics
by Xazz.


Standing out in the warmth, covered up by the heat.
Hide my face from the crowd and just stare at my feet.
The ground of the world meant for you, not for me.
Don't have a reason or purpose from what I can see.
See.

When you feel it, you know it.
You love it, what matters the most.
And you know.
It's bigger than you.
And then me and the words that we spoke.
And you know.
I'm climbing and swimming upstream.
Just to find my way home.
And you know.
That the feeling I'm feel.
Is the thing that is bringing me home.

Working hard to find love in a world left without.
I'm a cloud treading on, not a stream flowing down.
Savor the smile and the laughs, they're the best ones around.
Helping hands, giving hands, sharing the wealth we were bound.
Bound.

When you feel it, you know it.
You love it, what matters the most.
And you know.
It's bigger than you.
And then me and the words that we spoke.
And you know.
I'm climbing and swimming upstream.
Just to find my way home.
And I know.
That the feeling I feel.
Is the thing that is bringing me home.

Follow the road, where you know you should go.
Take me home.
Take me home.

When you feel it, you know it.
You love it, what matters the most.
And you know.
It's bigger than you.
And then me and the words that we spoke.
And I know.
I'm climbing and swimming upstream.
Just to find my way home.
And I know.
That the feeling I feel.
Is the thing that is bringing me home.
