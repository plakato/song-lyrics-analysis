Sixteen Ways Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

16 years, 16 ways, they shot my babies by mistake.
I'm all alone on a midnight ride, my 16 kids they all have died.

They ain't coming back, it's too late.

I haven't slept in 14 days, now it's time to barricade.
Myself in these four walls, my 16 kids they all are gone.

They ain't coming back, now it's too late.
They shot my babies but they killed my faith.
They shot my babies but they killed my faith.

I worked so hard for 40 years, I told my girl, said I had nothing to fear.
Then one by one they got shot down, the youngest one held a gun to his ear.

They ain't coming back, no-no-no, it's too late.
They shot my babies but they killed my faith.
They ain't coming back, no, it's too late.
They shot my babies but they killed my faith.
They shot my babies but they killed my faith.
They shot my babies but they killed my faith.
They shot my babies but they killed my faith.
