Run Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

No one has the right.
Especially when they say.
Apologies dont make.
So i'll take my love and my life.

Run to a shelter, run to a friend.
Better run for my life before it comes to an end.

Run to a shelter, run to a friend.
Better run for my life before it comes to an end.

I am gonna run far away from here.
No more cussin, no more fighting, and living in fear.

I am gonna run far away from you.
I have come to my senses and I dont need you.

I am gonna run gonna leave you today.
Cause I know there's got to be a better way.

Im gonna run, take my children's hand.
We are leaving this nightmare as fast as we can.

I don't even know, in which direction I should go.
But im sure its the right thing to do, its time to make a move.
The first time I was shoved, I shoulda been out the door.
But I accepted the spologie, open myself up for more.

Abuses, excuses, abuses, excuse me!

I don't have to live this way, Im leaving you today.

Abuses, excuses, abuses, excuse me!

I don't have to suffer anymore, im walking right out of that door.

Run to a shelter, run to a friend.
Better run for my life before it comes to an end.

Run to a shelter, run to a friend.
Better run for my life before it comes to an end.

Some of my so called friends, advised me to stick around.
Their not the one's getting burned, slapped or beaten down to the ground.
They say financial security is hard to come by for a woman like me.
And for the children, I need a good home, so I should sacrifice until their.
grown.

Abuses, excuses, abuses, excuse me!

I don't have to suffer anymore, im walking right out of that door.

Abuses, excuses, abuses, excuse me!

I don't have to live this way, Im leaving you today.

I am gonna run far away from here.
No more cussin, no more fighting, and living in fear.

I am gonna run far away from you.
I have come to my senses and I dont need you.

I am gonna run gonna leave you today.
Cause I know there's got to be a better way.

Im gonna run, take my children's hand.
We are leaving this nightmare as fast as we can.

Now, I don't blame myself for the present situation.
For this, kind of behavior, there is no justification.
Im looking ahead to the future, I won't forget the past.

Abuses, excuses, abuses, excuse me!

I don't have to live this way, Im leaving you today.

Abuses, excuses, abuses, excuse me!

I don't have to suffer anymore, im walking right out of that door.

I am gonna run far away from here.
No more cussin, no more fighting, and living in fear.

I am gonna run far away from you.
I have come to my senses and I dont need you.

I am gonna run gonna leave you today.
Cause I know there's got to be a better way.

Im gonna run, take my children's hand.
We are leaving this nightmare as fast as we can.

Run to a shelter, run to a friend.
Better run for my life before it comes to an end.

Run to a shelter, run to a friend.
Better run for my life before it comes to an end.

Run to a shelter, run to a friend.
Better run for my life before it comes to an end.

Run to a shelter, run to a friend.
Better run for my life before it comes to an end.
