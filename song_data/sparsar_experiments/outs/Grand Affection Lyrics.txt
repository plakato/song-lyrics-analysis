Grand Affection Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Grand love grand a lot of things, 
There's, always something more wise than my words. 
Stranger hope, I'm not bothering 
My love is something the rest of my world. 
 
No overdose on apathy, 
No, empty, sound, no empty seat, 
With, all those jewels and all those crowns 
Why. Don'T the queen go feed the hungry, 
No, stylish, cunts, no wasteful, hum 
No, uptown strain no tasteful pain, 
No eyes for sale. No bottled love 
That makes me cry grand affection, 
, 
Cry, grand affection cry, grand affection, 
Cry, grand cry, grand affection, 
Cry, grand affection cry, grand affection, 
Cry, grand cry grand 
 
I was raised by two opposites. 
Must, be why I am at war with the obvious 
You're. Taking me to paradise and letting me stay 
If, I whistle in the wind it's heard it may never go away. 
 
No overdose, on apathy, 
No, empty, sound, no empty seat, 
With, all those jewels and all those crowns 
Why. Don'T the queen go feed the hungry, 
No, stylish guns, no wasteful, hum 
No uptown strain, no tasteful pain, 
No eyes for sale. No bottled love 
That makes me cry grand affection, 
, 
Cry, grand affection cry, grand affection, 
Cry, grand cry, grand affection, 2x 
Cry, grand affection cry, grand affection, 
, 
Cry, grand cry, grand affection, 
Cry, grand affection cry, grand affection, 
, 
Cry, grand cry; grand 
, 
, 2x 
It's. Taking me to paradise and letting me stay 
If, I whistle in the wind, it's heard:
