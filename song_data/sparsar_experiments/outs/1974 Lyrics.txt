1974 Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

We were young 
And, none of us know quite what to say. 
But the feeling moved, 
Among us in silence. Anyway, 
Slowly we had made 
Quite a change. -- 
Somewhere. We had crossed a big line 
Down upon our knees. 
We had tasted holy wine 
And. No one could sway us 
In a life time 
 
Purer than the sky 
Behind, the rain 
Falling down all around us 
Calling out from a boundless love, 
Love had lit a fire
