A Kind Of Magic (Taylor) Lyrics
by Queen.

Queen.
Classic Queen.
A Kind Of Magic.
It's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic.
A kind of magic.
One dream, one soul, one prize.
One goal, one golden glance of what should be.
It's a kind of magic.
One shaft of light that shows the way.
No mortal man can win this day.
It's a kind of magic.
The bell that rings inside your mind.
It's a challenging the doors of time.
It's a kind of magic.
The waiting seems eternity.
The day will dawn of sanity.
It's a kind of magic.
There can be only one.
This rage that lasts a thousand years.
Will soon be gone.
This flame that burns inside of me.
I'm hearing secret harmonies.
It's a kind of magic.
The bell that rings inside your mind.
Is challenging the doors of time.
It's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic.
This rage that lasts a thousand years.
Will soon be will soon be.
Will soon be gone.
This is a kind of magic.
Tere can only be one.
This life that lasts a thousand years.
Will soon be gone.
Magic - it's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic.
Magic, magic, magic, magic.
It's magic.
It's a kind of magic.
