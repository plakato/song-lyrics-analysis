Calm Down Juliet Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Hello lovely.
I'm corruption.
I just noticed that you seemed a little down.
Just sign right here on this line and.
I can change your life.
This is a blind shot in the dark.
I don't think what you need is love.
Take that off we're gonna make you a star.

We'll sell your soul.
Like it's gold.
Like it's gold, like it's gold, like it's gold.
Sell your soul.

Well I gotta get away from this place.
Cigarettes and cheap lipstick.
And I know this world ain't turning for us.
Get away from all this plastic love.
Let me be your drug.
Dead inside.
My skin crawls up my spine.
I've gotta get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.

Hello darling.
Names seduction.
Why don't you find something comfortable.
Let me take your coat.
Don't be reluctant oh.
Nothing you want can phase me.
I'm all ice inside baby.
Let's fix that addiction.
You're sick'n.
I've got the remedy.
So save the speech.
Leave all your sorrow at the door.
The dead don't need it anymore.
I told you.

Well I gotta get away from this place.
Cigarettes and cheap lipstick.
And I know this world ain't turning for us.
Get away from all this plastic love.
Let me be your drug.
Dead inside.
My skin crawls up my spine.
I've gotta get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.

Can I be something other than a sisteen wet dream.
Oh I'm not a fucking fix for a fiend.
What's more I didn't sign up to be aâ€¦

Perfume and parliaments to pacify my clientele.
We're all mad here.
That's why we're living in hell.
The desperate.
The broken.
The homeless.
I go and take what I want.
And I want it now.

Well I gotta get away from this place.
Cigarettes and cheap lipstick.
And I know this world ain't turning for us.
Get away from all this plastic love.
Let me be your drug.

I gotta get away from this place.
Baby you look ravishing.
Inebriants and deviants.
No better place for you to sleep.

Get away from all this plastic love.
Let me be your drug.

Get out.
I've got to get out.

Dead inside.
My skin crawls up my spine.
I'm fucking dead inside.
My body aches from swine all over me.
Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.
