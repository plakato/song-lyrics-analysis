Almost Cut My Hair Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.

Almost cut my hair.
It happened just the other day.
It's gettin' kind of long.
I could've said it was in my way.

But I didn't and I wonder why.
I feel like letting my freak flag fly.
And I feel like I owe it, yeah ... to someone.

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas.
And I'm not feeling up to par.
It increases my paranoia.
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car.

Well I'm not giving in an inch to fear.
You know I've promised myself this year.
Well, I feel like I owe it, I owe it to someone.
Oh ... like I owe it to someone.

Instrumental.
Oh yeah when I get myself together.
You can find me in that sunny southern weather, yeah.

I'm goin' to find a space inside to laugh.
Separate the wheat from the chaff.
Oh, and I feel ....
Like I owe it, yeah ... to someone.
