Around the block Lyrics
by Tyler James Williams.

Phantom come alive in the night time.
I spit free styles, I don't have to write rhymes.

When it comes to your rhymes.
Eh they're the worst.
Your flow's sloppy.
Punchlines? brush them off me.
Yeah I'm so cocky no way you could stop me.
Swag through the roof, believe that's the truth.
How'd I know that? Yo, I'm living proof.
I just do what I do when I'm in the booth.
I've got a finer chick, hotter whip, sicker crew.
Ooh, you just got lyrically smacked.
Better think twice before you try to clap back.

Yo, why you got to get up in my face like an air bag.
Ooh your breath's bad, you need to step back.
In fact forget that, you need some gum jack.
Plus a stylist cause you got no swag.
DJ say you wa-wa-wa-wack.
You wouldn't have rhymes if you stole my notepad.
And you can quote that, put it on a blog.
So everyone can read it, i've never been defeated.
Freestylin' is a competition sport and Rev is king, why's this fool on my.
court.
It's not a battle, it's more like a roast.
Rapper white sheet I turn phantom to a ghost.
And it's like that, one time for your mind, Revelation with the rhymes.
