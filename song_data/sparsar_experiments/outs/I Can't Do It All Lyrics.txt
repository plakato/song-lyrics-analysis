I Can't Do It All Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


I woke up missing you this morning.
After running into you last night.
The way you kiss me like a friend is so heartwarming.
But baby, when we meet again.
If you really want to be my friend.

Tell me that you're never ever coming back.
When you're out on the town stop looking like that.
Tear out your telephone jack in case I get the urge to call.
Got my work cut out to get you out of my heart.
Tears to stop, a new life to start.
Put my world against the wall.
I could use your help, I can't do it all.

Try to make myself believe it's over.
But I don't believe I'm equal to the task.
I got a million memories to go.
And I'm getting nowhere.
Oh, and help is hard to find.
So if you could be so kind.
