Loveseat Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

Sitting on your loveseat.
Making conversation.
We have identical intentions.
For tonight.
And I'm pretty sure.
You wanna to kiss me.
But I'm too nervous.
To lean in.
And find out if I'm right.

I keep touching your knees.
Whenever we agree.
The room is so warm.
Your lips are.
Overwhelming me.
The way you form your letters.
Each word just makes it better.
The formation's so distracting.
That the content barely matters.

Your paragraphs.
Are an epitaph.
For my self restraint.
My patience is waning.
Not sure.
How long I can wait.
But you're looking at me.
With full moon eyes.
So soft and clear and bright.
And I know it will.
Be worth it.
Even if it takes.
All night.

If you kissed me when.
I walked through the door.
I probably wouldn't.
Like you as much.
But these anxious hours.
Of anticipation.
Will just make it.
That much better.
When our lips.
Finally touch.
