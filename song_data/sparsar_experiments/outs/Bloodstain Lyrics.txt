Bloodstain Lyrics
by UNKLE.

They say if you took it all away.
This love would fall apart.
I say, no way.
You don't know the size of my heart.

Vicious, suspicious.
It doesn't matter what I say.
Users and losers.
There's nothing here to make me stay.

Bloodstain on a blue vein.
Take it with no shame.
Love tracks on a loose train.
Bloodstain.

No gain with no pain.
My scars are deeper than you think.
Tie me, try me.
One more time before I sink.

Big lies, big times.
This love is not what we're about.
It's too late, and I'm too straight.
It's time to blow this fire out.

Bloodstain on a blue vein.
Take it with no shame.
Love tracks on a loose train.
Bloodstain on a blue vein.

Take me softly.
I'm going crazy for your touch.

Bloodstain on a blue vein.

Take it with no shame.

Be Be K Roche sample :.
I'm alone.
And dissatisfied.
And someone else is alone.
And dissatisfied too.
