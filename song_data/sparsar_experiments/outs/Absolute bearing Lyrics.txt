Absolute bearing Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

When I look in your window it seems like make believe.
Just an empty suit case, your car in a hole.
You're free.

The funeral couldn't change my mind.
I know you're out there, I know you're out there.

The police man says they never found a body.
Nobody.

The lakes too deep, the hearts too weak.

The newsman spewing the black from the bottle.
The headlines bleed, the taglines cheap.

The funeral couldn't change my mind.
I know you're out there, I know you're out there.
