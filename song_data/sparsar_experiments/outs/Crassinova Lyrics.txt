Crassinova Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Do, you remember when....
It was hard to say.

They, say the brightest love....
Has the darkest end..
Maybe they were right; I was never a fan....
Of lips coated in, arsenic and cyanide....

If we've both done all we can do....
Then what are we still fighting for?
I can't remember when I last saw you....
This situation's out of my control....

How can you feel something broken?
Does anyone find solace?
How can you see all is lost....
Still lacking all that you need?

Do, you remember when....
It was hard to say I love you?
Then everything was fine.
We'll find ourselves alone in time.
I can't imagine where we're going....
But, I'm not happy here.

I swear I'm pretty blessed....
I just want these memories to quit flashing in my head.

God all you do is bitch.
This is not about you; Get it through your head.
You're so selfish.
I can never win, you can never win....
So let's just drop this where it stands.

This is not the end....
This is my rebirth into something I can comprehend.
I don't want you dead....
I just wish that you would stop wasting my time....
Fuck....

This haunting has got me darling....

Do, you remember when....
It was hard to say I love you?
Then everything was fine.
We'll find ourselves alone in time.
I can't imagine where we're going....
But, I'm not happy here.
