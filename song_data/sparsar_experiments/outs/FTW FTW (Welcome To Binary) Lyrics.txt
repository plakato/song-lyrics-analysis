FTW FTW (Welcome To Binary) Lyrics
by UNDERSCORE.


Fuck the world for the win, I might as well begin.
To spit when I spin whenever I'm rolling in.
And I'll win all my fights to indite my prowess.
I don't knock shit down. Bitch I might build towers.
I'm gon' come through, bitch I don't need no crew.
I'll take all the help I'm given but not from you.
I ain't got no limit it's futile to inhibit.
I've already received my fucking ticket to win it.
Look, this shit has always been my vision.
I'm so driven, I've already braced for collision.
I'm already fighting, I've already begun.
This has been my dream since motherfucking day one.
Look I rap so tight, I hold on to my spite.
My rhymes alone will set my fucking haters alight.
My time has come, And it'll never run out.
Wait I just realized that my album's come out.
Yeah My album's come out, uh.

Welcome To Binary.
