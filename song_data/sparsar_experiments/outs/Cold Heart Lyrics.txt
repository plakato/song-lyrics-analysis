Cold Heart Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

She got a crazy way of shaking sent my heart a breaking.
Inside my chest.
I lost my cool, I'm a fool for how she moves in that painted on dress.
She said uh uh not so fast.
I see some trouble in your past.
Ain't like them other girls, honey I'm the best.
If you want it.
You check your cold heart at the door.
Once you got it.
You know you're gonna want some more.
You want hot like the sun.
Babe I'm the one.
If you want it.
Check your cold heart at the door.
She could tell that I was dreaming, I was scheming.
How to get her with me.
She said listen if you're wishing for some kissin'.
Better ask pretty please.
If you wonder why I bothered.
It's cause I can burn you hotter.
Don't wanna leave you hanging out to freeze.
If you want it.
You check your cold heart at the door.
Once you got it.
You know you're gonna want some more.
You want hot like the sun.
Babe I'm the one.
If you want it.
Check your cold heart at the door.
