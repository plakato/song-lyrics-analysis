Lack Thereof Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Listen here boy; you've got a lot to learn.
Do you want what you want, or are you gonna wait your turn?

Breathe deep, I can't see, or think, your lead.
But you know what you've gotta do:.
Before they're turning on you.

I won't let you be a passing nod.
I can see you're lost.

And if they come for, you in the morning:.
They're coming for me in the afternoon.
Slyly the sky grins: Hollow, that you are my friend..
There was murder in the next room.

Listen here child, if you wade in the dark.
The shadows are crawling on you.
Make me believe, that you believe in you.

They'll catch you sleeping, soundly with your face down.
Blank out every sound of us in anguish.
Do as you please, but please just don't lie to me.
Don't lie to yourself.

If you could see their ends:.
Nobody's coming back.

All that you believe is cowardice cloaked in deceit.
Countermeasures of your inability, incapacity to:.
Understand what a life is worth.
I don't wanna be the one to tell you that you're dead inside.

Once you're gone, you're gone.
And there's no way back from hell.
Find your grace in a shell.
