Pray Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


They say the hardest part is leaving you.
At times you were my only friend.
Right now I don't know what I'm going to do.
You've hurt me time and time again.

Oh no, not again.
Say you never did but you want it like that.
Oh no, not again.
God doesn't give with both his hands.
Both his hands.
God doesn't give with both his hands.

Here it begins.
I took off my name, now I'm nailed to the sins.
