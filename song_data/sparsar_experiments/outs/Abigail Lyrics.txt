Abigail Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Abigail won't you take me to to the willow tree.
And when we get there.
I hope you'll recite Japanese.
What does it mean to win, I ask myself again.
Abigail, don't pretend.
Pretty flowers crush his heart on a world of make-believe.
Whispers floating words so soft.
Hands go walking down my sleeve.
Hold my hand, Oh Abigail.
And tell me everything.
Hold my hand, Oh Abigail.
I won't let go for anything.
Abigail won't you take me to to the willow tree.
Nighttime comes on strong.
But she is the sun and has a drink.
Hold my hand, Oh Abigail.
And tell me everything.
Hold my hand, Oh Abigail.
I won't let go for anything.
