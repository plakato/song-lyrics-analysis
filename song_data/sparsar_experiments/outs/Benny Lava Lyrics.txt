Yo Himanshu with the pen I'm killing it 
The white man, the villain, 
them deny them penicillin
, 
Syphilis experiments, death to the Tuskegee men 
Somewhere in New York. They say death to the squeegee men, 
They, say, stop and try to frisk 
I, say whoa just suck my dick 
I ain't white, but I know my rights 
And, you full of shit, 
I'm, a big belly, rude boy, 
I'm, a fat sweaty, Hindu, 
Stinky, sticky, icky 
Yeah. I'M smoking on that mildew 
Thick black chest, hair fat, gold chains, 
Somewhere out in Trapistan, flipping cocaine, 
My cousin on the field, 
He tend to poppy all day, 
Hima. He a fiend, 
He friends with papi on Broadway 
She, like Ain't that you with the Muslims, 
You and Rizwan, be movin things, 
With your crew and them 
What. You do with them 
Truants and the bluest man, 
Yeah momma said they was the Taliban 
Hang around in alleys and 
Rally them 
Ain't that what they said bout the Italians 
Come Mr. Tallyman 
Come Mr. Tallyman 
Come Mr. Tallyman 
From, Ghana, to Uganda. You a goner, I'm your father 
Ain't, nobody hotter 
The devil in some Prada 
The pope in some Gucci, 
Your baby wearing nada, 
Swetshop Boys and we hot as benny lava 
Hot as benny lava

Swetshop boys, tidy love, 
Red hot joints, write too much 
For there ain't not choice times are tough 
But, my yellow cab drivers ride with us 
Like, damn I'm home late. I light one up 
Smoke since I'll, never be white enough. 
And plus Bombay stock price is up 
Is, inviting us sayin book a flight. You mug 
It's, not a toy. It'S not Rhymes-R-Us 
But. It'S made by brown boys that are tired and fucked 
Wheels hamsters deals. Wankers 
Kiss the grizz feel how deep our fangs are. 
She give you a free, kick 
But, then you get Lampard 
And you ain't! Coming in no more 
Like, you try bringing a crackhead to a man's yard, 
Get a fresh can on a bit of rough 
And, a cop gang and a bit of us 
And. Now I'm not praying just a little hush 
For the fans that PRISM who listening to us, 
So giggle up the urban spies up 
And the 90s asian day, timers 
And, Prince Naseem and that
Adidas tracksuit 
Green with white stripes, timeless 
As the beef from the Af-Pak border 
Well. There'S a the kid just a little bit taller 
Than the assault rifle he rides with 
Suicidal. He want a
moonwalking Michael 
Say. He got bleached out and
thinking of bleed now 
One sparkly glove on his trigger hand 
As. He sings Man in the Mirror and leaps out 
Brah game over we shot for the head. That'S bonus points, 
The kid holding joint with Xbox controller 
Who. Do you think flies the drones bruv 
But when we on the poster Photoshop us less darker 
Sow my crops, I'm the melanin farmer, 
Swetshop Boys. We hotter than benny lava
