Going To A Town Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.


I'M going to a town that has already been burnt, down
I'm, going to a place that has already been disgraced
I'm gon na see some folks who have already been let down
I'm so tired of America

I'm gon na make it up for all of The Sunday Times
I'm gon na make It up for all of the nursery rhymes
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
I'm. So tired of you, America

Making, my own way home ain't gon na be alone
I've, got a life to lead. America
I'Ve got a life to lead

Tell me. Do you really think you go to hell for having loved 
Tell me enough of thinking everything that you've done is good
I really need to know after soaking, the body of Jesus Christ in blood
I'm, so tired of America

I really need to know
I may just never see you again Or might as well
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
I'm, going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm, so tired of you America

Making, my own way home ain't gon na be alone
I've, got a life to lead. America
I'Ve got a life to lead
I, got a soul to feed
I, got a dream to heed
And. That'S all I need

Making my own way home ain't gon na be alone
I'm going to a town
That has already been burnt. Down
