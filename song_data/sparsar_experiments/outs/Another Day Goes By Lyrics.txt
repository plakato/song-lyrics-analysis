Another Day Goes By Lyrics
by The Virus.

I wake up to my problems.
That never go away.
I try and stay content.
With keeping my life at bay.

I question all the answers.
Another day goes by.
I watch as the world spins.
Another day goes by.
I seem to be going nowhere.
Another day goes by.
Another day.
Another day goes by.

I need to ask some questions.
I need a straight reply.
It's hard to make decisions.
When all you have is lies.

I question all the answers.
Another day goes by.
I watch as the world spins.
Another day goes by.
I seem to be going nowhere.
Another day goes by.
Another day.
Another day goes by.

I'm fu*king going nowhere.
I live my life on trial.
Days seems so pointless.
I live in such denial.
Denial.
Denial.

Another day goes by.

I question all the answers.
Another day goes by.
I watch as the world spins.
Another day goes by.
I seem to be going nowhere.
Another day goes by.
Another day.
Another day goes by.
