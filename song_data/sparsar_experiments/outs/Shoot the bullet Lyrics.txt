Shoot the bullet Lyrics
by Queen of Hearts.

Shoot the Bullet.
Keep me waiting.
For.
Your love.
And.
Syncopated.
We.
Would touch.
Bad.
In a moment.
Give it up.
And run.
Shoot a bullet.
Through my heart.
And shatter all inside.
You conceale it.
But I feel it.
All the time.
We would play out.
Love sharade but.
Behind closed doors.
We were scarred hearts.
Always watching.
Love depart.
Shoot a bullet.
Through my heart and.
Shatter all inside.
You conceale it.
But I feel it.
All the time.
Under the moonlight.
I pray for your.
