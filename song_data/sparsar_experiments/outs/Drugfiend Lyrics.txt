Drugfiend Lyrics
by Blood Duster.

I've been to hell you know that I've seen the show.
Been down that road and I've been driving on the go.

And you all know that I'm a drug fiend.
And you all know that I'm a drug fiend.

Don't care about the pace I'm keeping I don't care to think.
All I care about is where I'm gonna score my next free drink.

And you all know that I'm a drug fiend.
And you all know that I'm a drug fiend.

Eyes open wide against their will.
I'm a drug induced killing machine.
Drug fiend.
Pumped full till my stomachs bleeding.
I can't sleep to dream.
Drug fiend.
Don't like you shitty band no I dont dig that shit.
I come for pills so fuck your scene man.
My shit don't stink.
Eyes open wide against their will.
I'm a drug induced killing machine.
Drug fiend.
Pumped full till my stomach's bleeding.
I can't sleep to dream.
Drug fiend.
