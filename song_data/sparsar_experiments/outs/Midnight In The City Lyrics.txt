Midnight In The City Lyrics
by Ruse.

I've never seen you so sad.
What happened anyway?
Did he make you pay today?

I've never wanted you so bad.
Just something in you.
Pushing me away.

The more you push.
The more I crave you.
The more you push.

Just take your coat and leave your clothes.
Midnight in the city.
Break the skin, relieve the sin.
Midnight in the city.

Been on this block before.
I know this dirty street.
What it meant to me.

To get inside your door.
Tiny little room.
Was everything I need.

Oh the more you push.

Just take your coat and leave your clothes.
Midnight in the city.
Break the skin, relieve the sin.
Midnight in the city.
She'll swallow you whole.
There's no where else to go.
Oh no where else to go.

Just take your coat but leave your clothes.
Midnight in the city.
Break the skin, relieve the skin.
Midnight in the city.
Just take your coat but leave your clothes.
Midnight in the city.
Break the skin, re-live your sins.
Midnight in the city.
