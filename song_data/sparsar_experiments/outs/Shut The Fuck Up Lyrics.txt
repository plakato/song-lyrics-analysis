Shut The Fuck Up Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Lover, you are my tantamount.
Keeping my feet on solid ground.
And I need you, I do.
But I don't need your fear.

This is the new face of death:.
The face of endless torment.
It's where your war is and where your life will end.
At the hands of peasant's son:.
You think you'll run.
But I know where you hide.
Among the rats and snakes and faithless men.
Oh, father pray for me.
They've filled me with lies to the brim.
Shit.

Down in the city, ain't got no water.
I've gotta be the man, I can for my daughter.

I'm coming out tomorrow.
Lie to me baby, I'm afraid.
I'm coming out tomorrow either way.

We are the new face of death.
So, take a good hard look.
We're underneath your skin.
We want the lives you took paid for in red.
Got you looking underneath your bed:.
For this monster you created. Now get bent.
All out of shape.
I'll fucking break you.

If you're out here to run, then shut the fuck up.

Lover, you are my Antebellum.
Seizure over the weaker of me.
