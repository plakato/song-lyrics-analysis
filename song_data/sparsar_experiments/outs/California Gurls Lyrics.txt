California Gurls Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

Greetings loved ones.
Let's take a journey.
I know a place.
Where the grass is really greener oh oh.
Warm, wet and wild.
There must be somethin' in the water.
Sippin' gin and juice.
Layin' underneath the palm trees.
The boys.
Break their necks.
Try'na creep a little sneak peek.
You could travel the world.
But nothing comes close.
To the Golden Coast.
Once you party with us.
You'll be falling in love.
Oooooh oh oooooh.
California girls.
We're unforgettable.
Daisy Dukes.
Bikinis on top.
Sun-kissed skin.
So hot.
We'll melt your Popsicle.
Oooooh oh oooooh.
California girls.
We're undeniable.
Fine, fresh, fierce.
We got it on lock.
Westcoast represent.
Now put your hands up.
Oooooh oh oooooh.
Sex on the beach.
We don't mind sand in our Stilettos.
We freak.
In my Jeep.
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo.
You could travel the world.
But nothing comes close.
To the Golden Coast.
Once you party with us.
You'll be falling in love.
Oooooh oh oooooh.
California girls.
We're unforgettable.
Daisy Dukes.
Bikinis on top.
Sun-kissed skin.
So hot.
We'll melt your Popsicle.
Oooooh oh oooooh.
California gurls.
We're undeniable.
Fine, fresh, fierce.
We got it on lock.
Westcoast represent.
Now put your hands up.
Oooooh oh oooooh.
Toned tan.
Fit and ready.
Turn it up cause it's gettin' heavy.
Wild, wild West coast.
These are the girls I love the most.
I mean the ones.
I mean like she's the one.
Kiss her.
Touch her.
Squeeze her buns.
The girl's a freak.
She drives a Jeep.
And lives on the beach.
I'm okay.
I won't play.
I love the Bay.
Just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach.
And Palm Springs.
Summertime is everything.
Homeboys.
Hangin' out.
All that ass.
Hangin' out.
Bikinis, tankinis, martinis.
No weenies.
Just a king.
And a queen-ie.
Katy my lady.

You're lookin'here baby.

I'm all up on you.
Cause you representin' California.

California gurls.
We're unforgettable.
Daisy Dukes.
Bikinis on top.
Sun-kissed skin.
So hot.
We'll melt your Popsicle.
Oooooh oh oooooh.
California gurls.
We're undeniable.
Fine, fresh, fierce.
We got it on lock.
Westcoast represent.
Now put your hands up.
Oooooh oh oooooh.
California girls, oooh California gurls.
