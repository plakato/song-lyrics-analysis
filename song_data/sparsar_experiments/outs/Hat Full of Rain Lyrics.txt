Hat Full of Rain Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


I've been riding through the storm, feeling weary and forlorn.
Outside the shelter of your tender arms.
It's been forty days and nights since we said our last goodbye.
And there ain't a single rainbow in sight.

The sky keeps right on crying.
I keep calling out your name.
Can't find the will to keep on trying.
Got a heart full of sorrow and a hat full of rain.

I'm soaked clear to the skin, there's a cold chill setting in.
And this old Harley's shaking like a willow in the wind.
I've been up and down the coast, running from loves ghost.
It's the good memories that hurt the most.

Got to find the will to keep on trying.
I got a heart full of sorrow and a hat full of rain.
Oh a hat full of rain, a hat full of rain.

Hat full of rainx3.
