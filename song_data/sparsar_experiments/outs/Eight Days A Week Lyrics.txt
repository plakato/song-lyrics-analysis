Eight Days A Week Lyrics
by The Runaways.

Ooh I need your love babe.
I guess you know it's true.
Hope you need my love babe.
Just like I need you.

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me.
I ain't got nothin' but love babe.
Eight days a week.

Eight days a week.
I love you.
Eight days a week.
Is not enough to show I care.

Ooh I need your love babe.
Guess you know it's true.
Hope you need my love babe.
Just like I need you.

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me.
I ain't got nothin' but love babe.
Eight days a week.

Eight days a week.
I love you.
Eight days a week.
Is not enough to show I care.

I love you ev'ry day babe.
You're always on my mind.
One thing I can say babe.
I love you all the time.

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me.
I ain't got nothin' but love babe.
Eight days a week.

Eight days a week, eight days a week, eight days a week.
