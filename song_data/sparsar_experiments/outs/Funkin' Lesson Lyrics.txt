Funkin' Lesson Lyrics
by X-Clan.

Professor X.
Freedom or death, we shall all be moved.
Vanglorious.
This is protected by the red, the black, and the green.
With a key, sissy!

Brother J.
Abracadabra.
Allah baby, professor.
All hail Funkin' Lesson.
Sweet tongue, grand writer of scrolls.
Now behold, let the legend unfold.
Born in a cosmos, with no time and space to exist.
Vibe in the midst of the chaos.
Mortals label me as illogical, mythological.
They couldn't comprehend when I brought the word.
A stick called verb, a black steel nerve.
Teaching those actors and actresses.
Who write a couple of lines on what black is, really?
Then they label me a sin.
When a brother just speaks what's within.
I guess I'm blacker than the shadow in the darkest alley.
That they're always scared to go in, boo!
I wear boots and beads, bags and braids.
Stick and scrolls, rings and shades.
Walk in the light of the moon but I've never been a Batman.
African call it Blackman.
Brother extracts your African steps in your movements.
Enhance for improvements.
Grand funk, a new home for the phrase.
Funkin' Lesson the pathway.

Brother J.
Let me tell you about blackness.
Grits and cornbread how can you act this?
I exist on a plane, where the jar is my brain.
I'm living to retrieve self.
Antenae my stick.
Picture bigger, made of liquor, figure.
The pull of the trigger goes zoom not boom.
Not a bunch of sissies, but saviors, braver.
The red, black, and green.
Is just so much more than red, black, and green.
You ask what I mean.
But yet the sundial shades on lights and dreams.
Watch too late, oops, upside your head!
You drop through abyss like lead.
Where you going? What's your speed?
What's your pleasure? What's your need?
Trees and branches, roots and seeds.
Forwards, backwards, many degrees.
Questions, answers, what's the sum?
We have come.

Professor X.
Out of the darkness in panther skin comes doctors.
Driving pink caddies.
Bearing the remedy to your existence.
Yes, it gets blacker, with a Nat Turner lick.
Martin, Adam, Malcolm, Huey.
There's a party at the crossroads.

Brother J.
I returned from the stone crib.
Bringing verbal milk, a stool, and a bib.
Be filled of the black sap, from the tri-womb.
It flows freely un-attuned.
Wheat bread, tasty jam.
Come take a stroke to the rhythm of the Grand.
Verbalizer coming from the temple of void.
Crown from a hat, man from a boy.
Onwards ride as I talk of Ra.

I ride with Geb to roar with Bast.
Aten to Mut as I ride the raft.
Roof of the world I sit, crosslegged, right over left.
Drums of dance to drums of war.
Who knows the score? Speak no more.
Who watches down with the eyes of black?
To the east blackwards.

Professor X.
Sissy!
Sissy!
