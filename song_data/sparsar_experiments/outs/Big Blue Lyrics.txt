Big Blue Lyrics
by Sweet Valley.


Soulja woo 
Sweet Valley, 
With, the legendary Juicy J 
Les go 
Ye ye ye 
Remember me les go 
 
Ain't, no way they gon' forget my name 
I'm a legend putting in work. Ever since I came 
Ain't no umbrella nah. It can't stop my rain 
Your in the carpool, I'm in the different lane. 
I just wake up every morning every morning and go get the change 
Do my own dirty work and won't get a stain 
I'm too heavy in this game. 
And. You better know it hustle speakers for itself. 
Ain'T even got ta, show it 
 
With. All this bread need a bigger stomach. 
My name ring bells, so you can hear it coming 
Made it all my own. They gave me nothing 
And, I'm still stunting like a set of crutches, 
 
I'm, so raw stackin' up figures, 
You know I do it big nobody. Do it bigger, 
I'm, a legend on stage yeah. They takin' pictures 
I'ma, so ball. Hard'Till I get a penalty 
I go so hard make sure they will remember me 
My whole team, winning even through the winter 
My whole team. Winning. I can't take that loss 
Had to live my life and make myself a boss 
Now. It'S new foreign coupes when I'm in the streets 
R.I.P to the track cause. You know I killed the beat 
So clean, yeah ain't, nobody fresh as me: 
I guess: gold chains, foreign whips - was my destiny. 
I go hard for the fam. All them we got. 
 Got ta, kill everything til, I'm sitting at the top 
Maserati. That'S a lot of gwuap 
And the streets still going crazy, cuz, my buzz hot 
And, whatever they wan na do know, I'm with it 
Ass be SOD youngest. Ever did it 
All white with the diamonds. When I step out 
Young boss with the bag, I'm the best 
My foreign expensive, my bitch delicious 
My swag the fittest, my rims got 
Remember, I'm getting it 
Remember me 
I go hard and get cake like every week. 
 Got ta stay focused. While I get this check 
0-100 ye, I turn up to the max 
So. I go hard and the club make them damn shake 
Count, so much money that it made my hand break .
