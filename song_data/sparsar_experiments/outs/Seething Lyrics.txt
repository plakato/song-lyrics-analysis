Seething Lyrics
by Sydney.

Well it starts again.
To someone you don't hardly know.
You say that you have reap what you have sown.
I can't forget, this won't happen once again.

Tear out your lungs your words.
They can't hurt me pretend.
Our best direction you know.
Not your direction is it?

We've heard it all.
So don't say you're sorry don't say you're sorry now.

Well well if that's the truth and.
How can you trust anyone you hold so dear.
When they see clear through you?
But you're too busy cutting people you don't know into pieces you can hold.
Into pieces you can't hold.

Say oh so well it's all for you.
You have the passion you just lack direction.
Say oh so well it's all for you.
You have the passion you just lack direction.

Well I know exactly what you're thinking.
And know that this is what you'll have into you die.

Will you still be here when I come home?
Well it's just to see the look on your face.
I know we will be apart.

Say oh so well it's all for you.
You have the passion you just lack direction.

Say oh so well it's all for you.
You have the passion you just lack direction.

Say oh so well it's all for you.
