Pretty Beautiful Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

There's something about you, your every move.
It's like the sun comes up just to shine on you.
And you're a wild flower, in a world of weeds.
Ain't no doubt about it, you were hand picked just for me.

And baby you turn grey to blue.
Now what you do is wonderful, wonderful.
And you don't you know, that you're so beautiful.
Beautiful, you make pretty beautiful.
You're beautiful.

It ain't what you're wearing, or those diamond eyes.
It's the heart that you carry deep inside.
Like a mist in the morning, or the midnight rain.
You're the love that I want and I want falling down on me.

And baby you turn grey to blue.
Now what you do is wonderful, wonderful.
And you don't you know, that you're so beautiful.
Beautiful, you make pretty beautiful.

Baby, you're my one in a million.
You're the only one that's ever been so beautiful.

And baby you turn grey to blue.
Now what you do is wonderful, wonderful.
And you don't you know, that you're so beautiful.
Beautiful, you make pretty beautiful.
You're beautiful.

Don't you know, don't you know.
You're beautiful.

There's something about you.
Yeah, there's something about you.
There's something about you.
There's something about you.
