Braver Soldier Lyrics
by Russian Red.

When a woman loves a man all she does is shout.
When a woman loves a man all she is, is loud.
Oh won't she, oh won't she, oh won't she.
Be braver and solid and stranger to me?
When a woman loves a man there's no lousy crowd.
When a woman loves a man, well there's no hiding proud.
Oh won't she, oh won't she, oh won't she.
Be braver and solid and stranger to me?
Are they going to die? Well we're going to die.
Some day and so we'll be standing up and holding hands.
Sweating and dancing in shinym purple, shiny fields.
And so it is....
It ain't going to die cause I changed my mind.
