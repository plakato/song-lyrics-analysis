Paris Morton Music Remix Lyrics
by Zu.

Drake Singing.

Would've came back for you.
I just needed time, to do what I had to do.
Caught in the life, I can't let it go whether thats right I will never know.

Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong.
Tried to be patient, waited to long.
But I wouldve came back, but I wouldve came back.
Would've came back, would've came back.

ZU.

Mama, Life is what you make it, do the math boo.
And I'm slippin out ya fingers close your handles.
I'm falling out the sky into a bad mood.
And turn out that damn light, and the candle too.
Heart broken like China do.
And damn baby was a killer in that civilian suit.
I tried running but she a gold medal sprinter too.
That's what guerilla's do.
Took my heart and then she flew.

The sun and water were like me and you.
The purest form of reflecting a girl I thought I knew.
But I guess I never really knew.
The fascade you gave a nigga wasn't really you.
Truth, I spent my heart and my trust in you.
Jumped out of airplanes for the need of you.
Now I'm undoing damn shackles to get rid of you.
But in my heart you still remain like a constant do.
To you, forever is like faded truth.
Well I guess you're first place, like a winner do.
Well done, you kill niggas and go get your food.
Reminscent of a fool, how you made me look.
It was fun once I knew you.
But it was hard to figure out like sudoku.
Well I hope you feel proud, you crook you.
I hope your next nigga know about your slave ship.

Say she woulda come back.
But love burns and she wasn't lookin back.
Mona Lisa I never saw your damn back.
I thought it was beauty, but beauty don't bite back.
She said I hope you do forgive me.
Boy I hope you saw the stop from that ending.
Who's fault was it anyway?
I never said that this love would be a holiday.

She said she would have come back.
