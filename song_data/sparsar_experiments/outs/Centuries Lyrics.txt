Centuries Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Born in a time.
That you can't remember.
World was like hell.
From sky rained fire.
Created to fight and to koll.
Till just one survives.
To rule the world in the end.
Is our final aim.

We walked thru' the times.
Like the wind thru' your hair.
And you don't know.
That we're at your side.

We'll gather one day.
In a secret place.
And battle to the last.
To fulfill detiny.

Century to century.
We ride on the light.
From century to century.
We fight to survive.

Then me and the beast.
Stand face to face -.
Just the clash of the swords.
Is reaching my ears.
The strongest of all -.
Is now in my hand Time has come -.
To take his head.

We walked thru' the times.
Like the wind thru' your hair.
And you don't know.
That we're at your side.

We'll gather one day.
In a secret place.
And battle to the last.
To fulfill detiny.

Century to century.
We ride on the light.
From century to century.
We fight to survive.
