East to west Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

On that day when I see my King and death has lost its sting.
Until then I'm chasing after mysteries.
I'm chasing after you.

Living, you loved me.
Though I fought.
Dying, you saved me.
My soul bought.
Buried, you carried my sins away.
You carried my sins far away.

Carried my sins far away.
As far as the east is stretched from the west.
From east to west.

Suffering, imagine I cannot.
Forgiving, all my sins you forgot.
Rising, you eased our dismay.
You eased me of all my dismay.

On that day when I see my King and death has lost its sting.
Until then I'm chasing after mysteries.
I'm chasing after you.

Carried my sins far away.
As far as the east is stretched from the west.
From east to west.

I'm looking off into the distance.
And though it may just be a shadow.
I'm chasing after mysteries to find the joy in knowing Christ.

On that day when I see my King.
Clothed in all of His power, and His love.
I will join the choirs to sing of His mercies and grace.
With all of His beloved.
