Niggas On the Left Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.

Lyrics Clan in da front: let your feet: stomp 
Niggas, on the left, brag shit to death, 
Now hoods on the right wild for the night 
Punks in the back c'mon, and attract to ... 
 
Ayo hustlas, gangstas, bustas, wankstas, 
Cornballs, warhols, all y'all. I thank ya. 
For! Bumpin' Zetaphore Productions and Gravity 
The, Cut-Man and Graphic B back when were practically beggin' whores to hump
him 
We came a long way and now the metaphors are buzzin' 
I. Remember when my mutha-f*ckin' credit score was nothin' 
Now we make enough dough to break bread with all our cousins .... They never
saw this comin' 
Who expected all this clubbin'. T 
He hunnies been lovin' me since they saw me on Baby Girl and heard me on
Half A Dozen. 
My lyrics, got'em jumpin', so their jugs are jugglin' 
They huddle around me with their bubbles and let me touch'em 
Once. They get a hold of me. I might bend them over 
Have'em titties, lookin' over-easy and smash ovaries, 
 
Ayo snake-skin snap-back cocked by the dome-piece 
Dime-piece givin' dome-piece till I fall'sleep 
Wake up, half-baked ..., breath-stench, ..., Hennessy, 
The brain was so good that the b*tch took my memory 
Everyday's a new day/new brain 
That means my memory's gone temporarily: 
B*tch, I'm a dog, a brand-new pedigree., The type to hold it down: ... tits, ..., 
Gravity, 
My dick's by her cavities 
I'm sick, like a room full of mutha-f*ckin' allergies, the illest nigga
rappin' B, 
 
Yeah, ... CUTTA 
Music make'em jam, but The gun don't cause, I keep the clip clean, 
Bust, a nigga's dome
