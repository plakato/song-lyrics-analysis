GeneraShun (Intro) Lyrics
by Xali.


Welcome.
GeneraShun.

SoFlo Hip-Hop.
Cipher part 1.

Coming for your soul man.
That's real shit.

Yo.
And I do this for the GeneraShun.
Born in hatred.
When you put the word in separation.
Genera, means genius for short.
Shun means rejected.
Hol' up, let me tell you some more.
This the reason they never feel us.
The reason they tryn'a kill us.
They put a X on the NSA.
Our minds will never build up.
But you just feed the trees and not feel us.
And you can't reason with heathens, who non-believing and tweaking with you.
demons.
It's sound of a legion.
Rising crowds around and we need it.
For the down, defeated.
I'm in doubt my time's genius.
Still tell the system suck my penis.
And know I mean it.
My culture's depleted.
The vultures schemin'.
But they can't stop my flow.

And I do this for the GeneraShun.

Got ya, got ya.
Unclog your fuckin' chakra.
Silly niggas taking flakk puffs.
Microchip injection from your doctor.
While street cameras are scanning and planning for the man to lock your block.
up.
America, full of shenanigans.
Come for your character with mental handling.
Know the presidential got they hands in this.
System of credentials, Uncle Toms, upper-handed grip.
Tell me what the standard is.
My nigga, tell me what the standard is.
My nigga, tell me what the standard is.
When these cops, pull it on the kids.
With they hands to the skies.
Target march because their skin.
That's sick.

And I do this for the GeneraShun.

We ain't ever run.
Still I stand in place.
Come, with your loaded guns.
In my Malcolm phase.
I'm addicted how the outcome weighs, my lord.
No parade applause.
Get your K's and all.
That master tongue triggers killers from the blade to pause.
Fuck that fake facade.
Where rappers make mirage.
I wasn't made to fall.
I was made to calm.
Greatness acquired.
Wisdom divine, take me higher.
We facing a fire.
Prison in your mind, keep ya wired.
These times is dire.
Crooked smiles from the generated.
Out these federations, elevation for my GeneraShun.
