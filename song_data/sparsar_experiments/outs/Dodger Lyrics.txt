Dodger Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.

Renegade.
Renegade.
Renegade.
Ya ya woah woah.

Push the wheel like a drop top.
Tryna dodge ex girlfriends and dodge cops.
Woah woah hold up.
Woah woah.
Hold up.
Hold up.
I push the wheel like a drop top.
Dodging ex girlfriends and dodging cops.
Nike down to the ankle socks.
Massage your girl crip im in the bank alot.
Nike track and field im tryna run it up.
I might just hit it once and be down with that.
Trap house still ain't got no furniture.
A legend in the A like ted turner.
I push the wheel liek a drop top.
Tryna dodge ex girlfriends and dodge cops.
No no no i will not stop.
Haha ya.
I push the wheel like a drop top.
Tryna dodge ex girlfriends and dodging cops.
Massage your girl crip im in the bank alot.
Massage your girl crip im in the bank alot.
Woah.
