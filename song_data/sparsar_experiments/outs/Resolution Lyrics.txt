Resolution Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

No pride to feel, no waiting country.
No parades to line your way.
Though your hands may bleed, and your body may lie broken.
Every storm must soon give away.

Raise your head up high.
Raise your head up high.
So the heavens hear you cry.
Light the brightest fire.
From the highest mountain.
So the whole world knows.
That your spirit can't be broken.

The rage you feel will consume you and destroy you.
Let this rage inside you die.
One day, you'll find the signs in every motion.
Close your eyes so you might see.
I will hold you still, every second of every hour.
Let your actions speak your will.

Raise your head up high.
Raise your head up high.
So the heavens hear you cry.
Light the brightest fire.
From the highest mountain.
So the whole world knows.
That your spirit can't be broken.

Give up your fear.
These senseless longings.
Let this pain inside you die.

Raise your head up high.
Raise your head up high.
So the heavens hear you cry.
Light the brightest fire.
From the highest mountain.
So the whole world knows.
That your spirit can't be broken.
