Carbon Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

A million points of light.
Ascending to the sky.
Monuments in darkness.
Standing watch until the sun will rise.

Screaming to an emptiness.
How we deified ourselves.
With our hands over our eyes.
Claiming all of creation.

What inspires in us this madness.
That our existence should be defined.
By a light that can't be seen by anyone?

What inspires in us this madness.
That our existence should be defined.
By a light that we can't see.
The light that can't be seen.

A million points of light.
Ascending to the sky.
Monuments in darkness.
Standing watch until the sun will rise.

I can't see this all as progress.
How did we come this far?
When we see ourselves as deities.
Claim nature for ourselves.

By our actions we betray.
The instincts in our race.
By our blindness and stupidity.
We kill everything, we kill everything.

Can someone see our self destruction?
Are we reminding ourselves.
That our existence is so delicate.
That without this light we are no more.
That without this light we've made we are no more.

A million points of light.
Ascending to the sky.
Monuments in darkness.
Standing watch until the sun will rise.

We torch the earth until it bleeds.
Rain ashes from the sky.
Just to make a light that no one can see.

We cut the earth until it bleeds.
Rain ashes from the sky.
Just to make a light that no-one can see.
Just to make a light, just to make a light.
We kill everything.
By our blindness and stupidity.
We kill everything.

In ten thousand years, what will be our legacy?
A million lights that no one can see.
A million points of light.
