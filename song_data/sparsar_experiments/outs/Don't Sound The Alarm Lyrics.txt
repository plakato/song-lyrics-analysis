Don't Sound The Alarm Lyrics
by Vision.

I don't want you to know too much about me oh no.
I'm really getting freaked out in my long underwear.
I've got a lot to do today just try not to get in my way.

Too much to do is what I've got.
I now that I see you your so hot.
I like you, you don't like me.
And I've been spending my time just trying to see you.

I'm hurt and I will love you forever.
I'm hurt and I will be with you forever.
Sometimes you make me angry other times you make me glad.
