Red Barchetta Lyrics
by Rush.

My uncle has a country place.
That no one knows about.
He says it used to be a farm.
Before the Motor Law.
And on Sundays I elude the Eyes.
And hop the Turbine Freight.
To far outside the Wire.
Where my white-haired uncle waits.

Jump to the ground.
As the Turbo slows to cross the borderline.
Run like the wind.
As excitement shivers up and down my spine.
Down in his barn.
My uncle preserved for me an old machine.
For fifty-odd years.
To keep it as new has been his dearest dream.

I strip away the old debris.
That hides a shining car:.
A brilliant red Barchetta.
From a better vanished time.
We fire up the willing engine.
Responding with a roar.
Tires spitting gravel.
I commit my weekly crime.

Wind.
In my hair.
Shifting and drifting.
Mechanical music.
Adrenaline surge....

Well-weathered leather.
Hot metal and oil.
The scented country air.
Sunlight on chrome.
The blur of the landscape.
Every nerve aware.

Suddenly ahead of me.
Across the mountainside.
A gleaming alloy air-car.
Shoots towards me, two lanes wide.
I spin around with shrieking tires.
To run the deadly race.
Go screaming through the valley.
As another joins the chase.

Drive like the wind.
Straining the limits of machine and man.
Laughing out loud with fear and hope.
I've got a desperate plan.

I leave the giants stranded at the riverside.
Race back to the farm.
To dream with my uncle at the fireside.
