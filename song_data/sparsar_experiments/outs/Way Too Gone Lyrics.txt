Way Too Gone Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


I just stepped up out the crib.
Fresher than a nigga with a bib.
Different from the niggas where I live.
I don't even trip.
Shit was never meant to be a fit.
Now a nigga tryna get rich.
I done been good, handling my money like I should.
Telling all my bitches where they stood.
I done been wrong I done came way to strong.
Now a nigga way too gone.

Now a nigga way too gone.

I couldn't see the cracks until I cleaned the glass.
Trying to walk a cleaner path.
Nigga's gone hate but that don't mean you ass.
Now im doing me im seeing greener grass.
Head to the sky when I need to spazz.
Im a fucking star I don't need a cast.
Smoking up on Lincoln my interior been stinking.
Shit done had me thinking about my options and my reasons.
Im not in this in for no reason.
Im in this to be Sesus.
Leave these muthafuckers even though they couldn't see us.
Cop a shape up get that Caesar.
Dress up like a greaser.
You nigga's is Doug Funny and all your homies Skeeter.
I just want a skeezer no I don't want to keep her.
If she wanna fuck then she come ready like my pizza.

Stepped up out the crib.
Fresher than a nigga with a bib.
Different from the niggas where I live.
I don't even trip.
Shit was never meant to be a fit.
Now a nigga tryna get rich.
I done been good handling my money like I should.
Telling all my bitches where they stood.
I done been wrong I done came way to strong.
Now a nigga way too gone.

Now a nigga way too gone.

Yo I need a Benz just to say I copped it.
I need a yacht just so I can dock it.
A nigga need a safe just so I can lock it.
So when im poppin I can't have these bitches out of pocket.
I need a plane, no I need a rocket.
I told my momma she say I need to stop it.
I need my fam that's why I need a profit.
So they can ask for anything and I can say I got it.
Pardon my urgency great is what I prefer to be.
Nigga's that never heard of me soon to be claiming perjury.
Preferably ,I think you being sweet with that recipe.
So the fact that im going hard is a necessity.
When I...

Stepped up out the crib.
Fresher than a nigga with a bib.
Different from the niggas where I live.
I don't even trip.
Shit was never meant to be a fit.
Now a nigga tryna get rich.
I done been good handling my money like I should.
Telling all my bitches where they stood.
I done been wrong I done came way to strong.
Now a nigga way too gone.

Now a nigga way too gone.
