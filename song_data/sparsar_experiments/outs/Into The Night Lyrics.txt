Into The Night Lyrics
by Sweet.

I was a king thought of everything.
Into the night.
Then I was out everybody shout.
Into the night.
I kinda was having lots of fun.
Into the night.
And now I've lost gotta count the cost.
Into the night.

I couldn't lose.
When I was on top.
I couldn't lose.
But now it's all stopped.

I wore a crown then began to frown.
Into the night.
I cast a spell and it fell on me.
Into the night.

I dig a hole cause I got no soul.
Into the night.
I hear a phone then began to moan.
Into the night.

I couldn't lose.
When I was on top.
I couldn't lose.
But now it's all stopped.

I'm in a sea and they don't want me.
Into the night.
I think I'll drown oh I'm going down.
Into the night.
Is this a dream in a golden beam.
Into the night.
I look up high and there's no sky.
Into the night.

I couldn't lose.
When I was on top.
I couldn't lose.
But now it's all stopped.
