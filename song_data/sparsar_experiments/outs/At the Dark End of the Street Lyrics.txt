At the Dark End of the Street Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

At the dark end of the street.
That's where we always meet.
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong.
Living in darkness to hide our wrong.
You and me at the dark end of the street.
You and me.

I know time is gonna take its toll.
We have to pay for the love we stole.
It's a sin and we know it's wrong.
But our love keeps coming on strong.
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street.
You and me.

They're gonna find us, oh, they'll find us.
They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us.
Ooh, some day.
You and me at the dark end of the street.
You and me.

And when the daylight hour rolls around.
And by chance we're both downtown.
If we should meet, just walk on by.
Ooh darling, please don't you cry.
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street.
You and me.
