Be Famous Lyrics
by Sycosis.


I used to dream about cars and things/ 
About being a star and things/ 
I thought that I would outgrow these things/ 
Its seems my dreams. Won'T go away/, 
So its more like a nightmare. Keeping me up all night/ 
Like a nightmare its taking over my mind/ 
My desire burns inside like a flame, and it can't and it won't be contained
/ 
 
So I got ta be famous 
I got ta, be somebody/ 
So I got ta, be famous, 
I got ta, Be somebody 
, 
12 years old in my 6th grade class 
Spit, a freestyle and my niggas just laughed/ 
Told em one day, I'mma perfect that flow 
When. I sign my deal: I'mma stack that dough/ 

Full time job and my beard getting furry/ 

Its already the 10th and I'm damn near worried/, 
How Rap, going Fuck, you quit asking/ 
Most niggas trash and they fans just gas em/ 
Laugh at they ass when they pass. I harass them/ 
Tell em. I was born with the creed of assassins/ 
Tell em I'mma be in the back of they band wagon/ 
Leave stretched out with the 4 and I'm fantastic/ 
I'mma be famous for lyrics, I hand crafted 
Or else. We all going to war and you been drafted/ 
And. This is the sickness I spit with. The system was built against us/ 
But I'mma be famous, not nameless. This game is just glory and guts/ 
Sweat and some tears, damn its been years/ 
Blood and some pain, nightmares and fears/ 
Dreams, and some goals, demons and souls/ 
Stakes too high I'll, be damned if I fold/ 
Damned. If I leave damned if I quit/ 
Cuz, I'm so close, but yet so far, 
A ghetto star/a black lil kid 
Who, just wan na make it just get big/ 
Is. That too much is that unreal, / 
Is it in my hands or in God's will / 
Is. It up to me, or is it up to yall / 
If I get that high. Is it enough to fall 
 
Looking at my life, seeing what I became/ 
Baptized in water walking right into the flame/ 
Eyes on the prize for the family and the guys/ 
Fuck? The money and the fame I'm just trying to survive/ 
Trying to stay alive. When you grow up in the Chi/ 
Its psycho with the drama you could really do or die/ 
Its, kids killing. Kids, you just read it on the news/ 
But. They headed to the block. Instead of headed to the school/ 
Pistol and a tool see he hungry and confused/ 
You ain't thinking about your future, when you focused on some shoes/ 
Trying to push a pack til, you make a couple: racks/ 
Get fly for some hoes, can't no niggas hold you back/! 
But all these young niggas backwards/ 
And, all these Rap niggas actors/ 
And if fame, is a factor. 
I'Mma ball in the game, til my name in the rafters/ 
Change up the lane, I'm insane with this rap shit/ 
Aim with the flame like I came with a match. Stick/ 
Hit em with the heaters you can feel it through your speaksers/ 
Through, your subs and your tweeters 
Make, your brian. Do a black flip/ 
Shit too sick with the word play/ 
Blowing money fast call it cake on my birthday/ 
Trying to get a motherfucking single on the radio/ 
Paying all these dj's. They still won't play me, though 
 
Just, trying to make it out out here. 
We. All trying to survive 
Moving forward in any way we can 
Staying in motion trying not to give up 
Even when its a setup 
But we got ta make it 
We ain't got no choice, but make it 
You GOT TA, BE 
You HAVE TO BE 
You NEED TO Be Famous 
Then: this is what you do. 
Hustle
