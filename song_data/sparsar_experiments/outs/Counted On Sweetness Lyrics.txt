Counted On Sweetness Lyrics
by The Wrens.

i was born too soon is how my grave will read.
Lived to 35 but died at 17.
It took an hour or so to reach the border as planned.
A few miles from here i would never know.
I'll confess what i've done in time.
Lived through worse and never cared for anyone.
They never seemed to mind for me.
I left before they ever knew that i was gone.
It's the facts blood knows laid out in front of you.
Tied up in foolish news waiting for a view.
All the time i've been waiting by them.
Look at them they can't find me.
In walked the left to lose / chained down to please a few.
I wonder who they'll choose / i wonder who.
In whispered to my ear, what will you do until then.
Dream all you want me dear it's a fitting an end.
