Do it!
KEI .... Shon... Son.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
I know, I know.

Once again, once again my friend.
Another story bout a place I been.
Where the whistle of the wind sounds loud.
And... We all love the taste of the clouds... Now fingers talk so we don't.
need a mouth.
And the party turned up with them girls turned out.
I say, I say... Get paid, singing songs out loud.
Hundred rhymes wrote down got me feeling burnt out.
My god and the drinks keep coming.
Slutty little sluts never been about nothing.
Unless... It's all about nutting.
Got me shaking my head, I guess we out fronting... Wit 200 kids yet none of us.
cuttin'.
In a rush... Yet none of us Rushin' unless you're Russian then you're talking.
bout something.

Imma ride till the wheels fall off.
On me! With my hand on the bible.
Singing while the suns out side.
Till the moon come fight for the title.

La La La... La La.
La La La... La La.
La La La... La La.
La La La... La La.

Once again, once again my friend.
I'm bending corners in a car no ins.
And it's probably no tags and no L's.
Yeah it's really that bad.
Yet... It's kind of sad if you never ever had.
You know, you know.
How far the hole can go.
Telling fans posted up at a show.
That they really don't know ....
Yet, I don't really know.
In some brand new shoes and some kind of old cloths.
I'm making moves and I'm Trynna' make more.
With a phone full of hoes.
And that's a sign on the road Trynna show.
Where you really gone go.
So slow your role... This is more than a flow.

Imma' ride till the wheels fall off.
On me! With my hand on the bible.
Singing while the suns out side.
Till the moon come fight for the title.

La La La... La La.
La La La... La La.
La La La... La La.
La La La... La La.
