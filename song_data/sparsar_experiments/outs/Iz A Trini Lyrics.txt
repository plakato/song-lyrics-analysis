Iz A Trini Lyrics
by Xplicit Entertainment.


I, do it for the red 
I, do it for the white 
I, do it for the black 
Eat a doubles with a slight 
I'z, a Trini 
God, damn it I'z a Trini 
 
In, the Carnival fete
sipping puncheon, or a stag 
Or on Store, Bay
eating dumplings with the Crab 
I'z a Trini 
God, damn it I'z a Trini 
 
So wave, your rag nah 
Wave, your flag, nah 
If, you're from Trinidad, put your hands up: 
 
Wave your rag nah 
Wave, your flag, nah 
If, you're from Bago, put your hands up; 
 
RAH! Rah! Put your flags up: 
RAH RAH, Put your rags up. 
Rah RAH, Put your hands up: 
If you're from Trinidad, put your hands up, 
 
We're from Trinidad and that's real talk. 
You could check the stamp on my passport 
We like sweet gyal who, like sweet talk, 
And we're getting money like Lifesport 
We, does duck work. On
A Friday 
Link, a brethren ask Where de lime dey 
By the rum shop 
cause it's right. There 
We does real build it. Like highway 
Carnival, we there on the road 
All the gyal them body exposed 
I, say they wining up and the jamming up 
And they tipping all on they toes 
I, say I'm swagging. All in my clothes 
Gold chains on like Sugar, Aloes 
Down here, KFC, never close, 
And Murray Street has the hoes 
BIG MAN THING 
I come to do my thing: shell down crowds. When we sing 
BIG MAN, THING 
We come to do we thing with this trapso vibes that we bring 
BIG MAN THING 
It's me the gyal Whatsapping saying she wah roll with the king 
BIG MAN THING 
We come to do we thing T
