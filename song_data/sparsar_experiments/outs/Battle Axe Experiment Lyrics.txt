Battle Axe Experiment Lyrics
by Swollen Members.

Madchild 
Ah this shit, don't even sound human anymore., Its time to kill 
Rough terrain insane in my domain, 
Sadomasochism black whips and chains, 
There's. No stopping us soon to be popular 
Dark, snorkling shark fins. Circling 
You can't step to the fierce and ferocious 
Beast makes you nauseous. 
Hah, please be cautious. Murderous mindstate drown in the bloodbath. 
First comes the battle ram strike with the battle axe. 
Can'T fill my appetite: viking decapitate 
Turntable terrorist cuts that evaporate 
Ugh come from the depths of the underworld. 
Silver fire reigns supreme on the surface 
You ride the spirit horse, dream, catcher captures 
Take attack, posture structure, distracter, 
Im starin at ya; black tarantula 
Swollen, psychopath contract canceller 
 
Prevail 
Spinalcord curvature cracks over my overture 
Amateurs couldn't complete my massacre 
Haven't, you ever slept in the Hangman'S quarters, 
Laid down on a lay sharp chains, saw he spray 
Dazed as you reach for the handle on the door 
Amazed at the pattern. I'Ve engraved on the floor, 
Hard skills and handsaws skillsaws and metal, jaws, 
Vertebraic and algebraic against all odds, 
No Gods to deliver wrath on blood, river 
Rats and black withers half attacked prisoners, 
Mental, complex yells spells and vexed text 
Deliverance of the next dragons breath and bird Flesh 
 
Madchild 
Calm, surface serpents, sleeps, leviathan 
An, angel's assistant under Satan's surveillance, 
Vitalizer, psycho, acoustic, equalizer, 
Stars, explode, planet, Europa gets blown 
, 
Prevail, 
To oblivion, melt a warrior. What rock you living on 
Lovecraft necronomicon, Dr Fells, to Mephisto 
Dirty deeds with no leads 
Murky water runs red as the Holy Father bleeds 
, 
Prevail 
You speed toward the outline of the treeline in question. 
 
Madchild 
The forest area, where 4 people have gone missing, 
, 
Prevail, 
Apparitions cloud, your visions, fangmarks and incisions 
, 
Madchild, 
Uncontrolled muscle, contortions, sacrificial fetal position. 
 
Prevail 
And once through your mind that you live to see the sun 
 
Madchild 
And swore that you'd be the one, not 
, 
Prevail, 
With silver bullets in your gun, 
 
Madchild 
Now, the tables have shifted the table of the witched 
 
Prevail 
The altar of The altered alistair crowley offered 
 
Madchild 
Much, harsher than the jogger that they found in the marsh 
 
Prevail 
Become, the gateway through which the army of darkness will march 
, 
Madchild, 
My, still heart pumps, no liquid on a pedestal of marble, 
 
Prevail, 
No medical marvel. Will let you see tomorrow, 
 
Prevail now things have gotten out of hand
