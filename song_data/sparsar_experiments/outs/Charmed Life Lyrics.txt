Charmed Life Lyrics
by Vixen.

Got an angel on the left hand and a devil on the right.
She's gonna raise a little hell up in heaven tonight.
She likes the lightning run, but she never gets burned.
She's got to be the center of attention, and she's never gonna learn.

She's drivin' daddy's brand new car, she's usin' mama's master charm.
She acts so nonchalant, but the girl gets everything she wants.

Livin' a charmed life, everything's workin' out right.
Livin' a charmed life, you know everything's workin' out right.
You know she's livin', lovin', lovin', livin' - yeah yeah.

Watch her come around at midnight, flying high up in the moon.
She don't care about tomorrow, 'cos she was born with a silver spoon.
Everything she's got gets the boys at heart.
And she's got to be the center of attention, oh the girl can't stop.

She's drivin' daddy's brand new car, she's usin' mama's master charm.
She acts so nonchalant, but the girl gets everything she wants.

She lives a charmed life, yes she does.

She got her daddy's brand new car, she's got her mama's master charm.
She acts so nonchalant, but the girl gets everything she wants.

Livin' a charmed life  everything's workin' out right.
Livin' a charmed life, everything's workin' out right.
You know she's livin', lovin', lovin', livin' - yeah yeah.
She lives a charmed life, she lives a charmed life.
