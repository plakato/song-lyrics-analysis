My Dawgs Lyrics
by Two-9.


From the start me and my dogs 
Me and my dogs me and my dogs, 
 
We, was in them kennels at the start, 
Me and my dogs me, and my dogs 
Jumped off that porch and now it's Chevy's in the yard, 
Me and my dogs me, and My dogs 
I, said careful. If that fence is what you cross 
Me and my dogs me and my dogs 
I, say careful cause we biting. If we bark 
Me and my dogs me and my dogs 
That's how it go 
 
No leash on when my pit walk. They shell shocked when them shells drop, 
I, been out of town stacking, my money and making my rounds 
You cuffing your bitch. You can't bring her around 
I, build up her feelings to break em back down 
Yeah that bitch bad straight from the pound straight from the pound. 
You texting her phone and she fucking me now 
I'm hundreds to bury all of my weed is hairy, 
It's bricks on the fence and we scary 
And. I said it before. I never hit a bitch without sins, no more 
When, I step through the door. She got to be professional 
If, they don't know be the first to know. 
Up the street too discreet 
I made if from the Benz nigga close the door, 
From Parkway to 4th Ward, that red clay, 
Red nose at my front door, give her dick. Now she want more 
At the crib with my dogs, my yard, 
don't call for a gram got to get more ho: 
 
That Two-9 gang that Two-9 gang 
I twist my fingers and bang. If she back speaking our slang 
Then, you know she got drunk rolled blunts spit real life. Shit no stunts 
Talking deals need a mill from a city where they kill for a meal or gold
fronts 
All about a dollar pistols to your collar till they say the world is ours, 
Young and living for the hour, ay, 
Money, weed and hoes. That'S how the story go 
And if I die at 24 just know. I lived life fuck, the folks 
Blowing smoke on the coast, that's three hours behind 
But. Who cares about the time when all I see is nine ay 
I said who cares about the time? 
When? All I see is nine, when all I see is nine ay
