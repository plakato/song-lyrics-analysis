Something About You Lyrics
by Boston.

When I was younger I thought I could stand on my own.
It wasn't easy, I stood like a man made of stone.

But there was something about you.
I want you to know.
It brought a change over me.
It's startin' to show.
I've got this feelin' inside.
Gotta have ya, have ya, ain't no good to hide.

It isn't easy.
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl.
It isn't easy.
I know, when you believe in a man like me.

When I get angry I say things I don't want to say.
I really mean it, I don't want to leave you this way.
I couldn't help my reaction.
I want you to know.
I lose control over you.
I just want you to know.
Got this feeling inside.
Gotta have ya, have ya, ain't no good to hide.

It isn't easy.
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl.
It isn't easy.
I know, when you believe in a man like me.

It isn't easy.
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl.
It isn't easy.
I know, to believe in a man like me.
Like me, can't you see.
I got to, got to have you.

But there was something about.
Yeah there was something about you.
