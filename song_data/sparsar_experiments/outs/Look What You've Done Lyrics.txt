Look What You've Done Lyrics
by XO (Producer).


Mhm, *Deep breath* look what you've done.

Third month, of O eleven I met you.
It was march 12th to be exact , do you remember that.
We hit it off so perfect.
Every second you deserve.
Jade babe you were perfect.
And I was here to bring you something new , something fresh, something.
different from the rest.
Cause' you told me about your father and that loser even left.
So I begged you for a chance and happily you gave it up.
And for them first few weeks or month I swear to god we were in love.
I just felt it in my heart.
Even in my stomach.
But thinking on them arguments gone lead us both to vomit.
I said if we were strong we can surely overcome it, but I guess we weren't.
strong enough cause' now we so so distant.
And I miss it , them phone calls , up late , cute text.
It's just, human nature, to miss you , I wish I could.
Pick you up, talk about how I miss you, how I miss your voice , and I regret.
my choice.
And choice of words when we argued like fuck you I hate.
