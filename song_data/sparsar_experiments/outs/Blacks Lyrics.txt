Blacks Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

I've only got one bra to my name.
He said it's alright.
Did he hear that, did he hear it?

That's enough.
That's enough of even trying.
That's enough.
Oh, I wish it didn't matter.

He told his son.
He wants to kill himself.
He said it's alright.
I have had enough of this life.

Did he hear that, did he hear it?

I have had enough of this life.
