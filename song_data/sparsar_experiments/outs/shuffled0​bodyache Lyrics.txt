â€‹bodyache Lyrics
by Purity Ring.

And you feared a lonely death
I. I I lied now. I'M lying awake

I cried until my body. Ache


I couldn't stand how it pleaded
I read your head. Away

You said you said
I wan na stare at your tears. How they
I I I lied. Now I'm lying awake
I saw you break out. I saw you break out
Saw, you unreeling
Take a break. Take me down. Take me down there
Now, I'm lying awake. Now, I'm lying awake
I! I I cried'til my body ache
I lie. Now: I'm lying awake

I wan na stare at the tears how they watered your years
Take a break. Take me down. Take me down. There
I, couldn't look cause your body, your body would shake
I needed to take
Turn the lights down. I wan na be alone
You sweat and you bled
Now I'm lying awake. Now, I'm lying awake
Until, my body ache. Until my body ache
I, I I cried'til my body, ache
I wan na know, what's your
Like a lake leaves you alone in her depths
I lied. Now I'm lying awake


I. I I cried'til my body, ... 
I, wan na know. What'S your quietest feeling
