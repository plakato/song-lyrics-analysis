21st Century Blues Lyrics
by The Wombats.


Did you get that house, the one with the swimming pool?
The one you never shut up about.
I heard you got that job, and the extra pay works well for you.
Are you getting high and not coming down?

I need to decipher the differences between.
What I'll always want and what I'll never need.

I don't need your.
I don't need your swinging moods.
Your Twenty-first Century blues.
I want hugs not your scissor kicks.
I don't need your.
Your broken plans or your panda eyes.
Your help to improve my social life.
If my head's in the clouds, in the clouds I'll live.
In the clouds I'll live.

They say you've found some one with style to match their charm and wit.
But are you having sex in the morning sun?
And is your head screwed tight or has success began to loosen it?
Is the tip of the iceberg that much fun?

Oh, help me decipher the differences between.
What I'll always want and what I'll never need.

I don't need your.
I don't need your swinging moods.
Your Twenty-first Century blues.
I want hugs not your scissor kicks.
I don't need your.
Your broken plans or your panda eyes.
Your help to improve my social life.
If my head's in the clouds, in the clouds I'll live.
If my head's in the clouds, then in the clouds I'll live.

And I don't need your swinging moods.
Your Twenty-first Century blues.
And if nothing comes. then nothing has to leave.
If my head's in the clouds, in the clouds I wanna be.

I don't need your love.
If my head's in the clouds, then in the clouds I'll live.
