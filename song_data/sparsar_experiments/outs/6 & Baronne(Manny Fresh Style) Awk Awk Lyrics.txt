My name is Yella Boy; no, not Sylvester, Stallion 
Born and raised in third, because that's my home 
There's, not another gangster set like 6th and Baronne 
Because, the bitches peepin' out. Seven days a week, 
I wait for the first and third to get paid ya, see 
My boys in rumors creepin' up, but I just don't care 
This is live or die sucker. No, not you thug. There 
I ride on other gangsters turf and need a gangsta's fit 
Cash Money means ya, got to stay legit 
Throwin' paper in the air a quarter now an ounce 
Then. I call my dog bitch, take her to Wall Street and make her bow 
All the gangsters in the hood be up to no good 
Pack. The mutherfuckin' chrome smoke. Boo-Koo weed now ya feel good

Growin' up was hard, but it all paid off well. 
I was only eleven when I started to sell 
6th and Baronne was the set that I sold rocks. 
Drinks done went crazy because I'm servin' the block 
Now. I'M on the run, I guess I got to go. 
I slipped and sold to an undercover five-o 
They say they got a reward if ya know where I'm at 
But, I'm gon na make it hard for'em, because I'm packin' a gat 
Now. I never was the type to run away from my home 
Because, I'm a nigga from 6th and Baronne
