Yo.
When worst come to worst, my people come first.
My people are all that matter til I end up in the hearse.
With a suit and bowtie on headed to the heavens.
Gettin my fly on lifted like Iron with my bredren.
Until then im thinkin of the past tryna see clear.
In 1000 years, none of this shit will be here.
We run and skip and leap years.
On the moon, zero gravity, boom, like a witches broom.
So soon, im cop my people a crib.
A second whip, and give the rest to my moms to buy some extra shit.
That she never did, chillin livin benevolent.
Her dresses is elegant, bring her places she never been.
People tryna bring me down to where the devil is.
I'm already hot so I rose to where the pedals is.
In the whip pushin pedals kid.
I need the whole nation catchin wind like they runnin sprints.
So yall ain't gotta be in Tokyo to catch the drift.
When worst come to worst my people are comin with.
TwentyOne.
