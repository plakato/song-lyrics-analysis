Lighting The Fuse Lyrics
by Vision.

We still have hope that the world is going to change.
And all the violence will somehow fade away.
And I'm gonna bet that tomorrow is just like the rest.
So here it goes once again, we are put to the test.

Turn on the news, lighting the fuse.
Watching the world just burn.

We still have hope that the world will be a better place.
Never to be judged by the color of your face.
We know that you've heard this a thousand times before.
But this is a struggle we can't ignore.

Turn on the news, lighting the fuse.
Watching the world just burn.

I'm gonna sit and watch it burn.
I said I'm gonna sit and watch it burn.
I'm gonna sit and watch it burn.
I said I'm gonna sit and watch it burn.
I'm gonna sit and watch it burn.
I said I'm gonna sit and watch it burn.
I'm gonna sit and watch it burn.
I said I'm gonna sit and watch it fucking burn!
