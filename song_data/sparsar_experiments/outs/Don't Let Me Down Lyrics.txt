Don't Let Me Down Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Look at you.
You're my dream.
Are you all that you seem?
Now you have what I need.
And what I believe.
Don't tell me you'll lose it.
Cause I'll have to leave.

Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.

What do I have to give.
Until you let me live?
You're all that I work for.
But that's not enough.
Do I have to die too.
To show you my stuff?
Well, I give you my best.
So, why don't you understand?
I'm passing the biggest test.
So, don't cry.
Lend a hand.

Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.

Head held high.
Heart in hand.
Flesh and blood make a man.
If that disappoints you.
Well, what can I say?
I don't want you to hurt.
I just want to play.

Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
No, don't let me.
Don't let me down.
No, ohh.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
No, no, no, no.
Don't let me down.
No, ohh.
