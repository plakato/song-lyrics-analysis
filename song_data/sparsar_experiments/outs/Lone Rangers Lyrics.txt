Lone Rangers.

Wake up boy, you try, christmas tree, with me.
Wake up boy, you cry, christmas tree, with me.

I get up, get knocked down by the sound, right? I move my groove being.
Crossed &amp; get lost by the same night. I'm fed up, gotta catch up behind,.
get.
It off of my mind, gotta get away, no delay. I used to pet my mouse in my.
Pocket for fun. I used to look for a brace, so I could try my gun. People call.
Me scum, I didn't cut my hair. Now one would think that one wouldn't give.
A... Now. I was complained that everything was my fault. A bitch would.
Drip, and I was charged with assault. The deepest layer, had me for a.
Player, but look at me now, the high society slayer.

Wake up boy, you try, christmas tree, with me.
Wake up boy, you cry, christmas tree, with me.

What's up, all night, I get drunk, pick a fight x4.

Well, I step on the scene with my mind on the mission. With my lyrics so fat.
They never die from malnutrition. Go from brooks, roll the dice, roll the.
court.
Pay the price. Never wanted to hurt, cause I'm extra nice. Wasn't worth when I.
Go for the price, slam your ass down to earth, til you''re screamin for ice,.
like.
Winston Price. Fuck you up, like a bitch that was hanging from my dick.
Till I kicked her in the face, and left her in a ditch.

X4.

Well, I'm like a drug. You make me wanna hit &amp; run. Blow me sky high,.
through.
The Hi-fi, when I'm done. And it's one, two, having know what to run to.
To go &amp; get by and live a lie I knew. Forget about ways to get.
closer.
To graves. You're gonna messwithin two days. We gotta.
roll.
Til we die, and try to catch a body when it comes to the ride. So, I.
cried, as.
Soon.
As I heard, between second &amp; third. I bought a slave, put all of his pain.
in.
Vain, cuz.
Life was over, he was never coming back, sneak attack, by a lethal pack, on.
the.
Road track.
