She Wants to Be Wanted Again Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


She gets the kids up and off to school.
Work's never done till the day is through.
Same old routine over and over again.
There's alot of this world she's never seen.
She married young the boy of her dreams.
And to this day that's something she wouldn't change.
But she longs for the way he used to whisper her name.

She wants to be wanted.
She knows that she's needed.
She wants moonlight and romance.
Soft music and a slow dance.
She wants him to hold her.
Like he's never touched her.
That's how love began.
She wants to be wanted again.

It's Friday night and he's on his way home.
She's made plans for them to be alone.
Took the kids to her mama's they're gonna spend the night.
And she's hoping he'll notice how her new dress.
Fits her just right.

That's how love began.
She wants to be wanted again.
