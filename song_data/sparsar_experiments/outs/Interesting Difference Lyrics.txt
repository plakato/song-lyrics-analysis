Interesting Difference Lyrics
by TyC // 95 KiD.


Inside, the back of my mind. There is a character 
Nagging into my cavern. I'M gagging out of the massacre. 
Massive elaborate other rappers evaporate 
And, then collaborate. I can't relate to other candidates, 
Who can‘t debate when presented with facts, 
I've canned a date to can a kick-on on all of these cats. 
To go Usain, you sayin, „I, seen all of that“ 
2016 is years ago. Here we go attack 
Skiddin on these whack acts. Like mudflappers 
Rugrats
