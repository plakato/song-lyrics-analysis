Feminine Lyrics
by Swift.

Just go away: --, 
Im, trapped and im looking for a way out, 
You see this is no longer worth it. -- 
I mean the thought of you and i together. 
Forever no longer strikes me as perfect 
 
Im trapped in this world of love and hate 
Stuck. In this redundancy -- forced to evaluate 
My, coming situation, im basing all my love 
On the past, but the past won't last 
 
You! Won'T let go this fucking ball and chain. -- 
Has got me acting like your enemy, and i 
Don't know what i want anymore. 
 
Im, trapped and im looking for a way out, 
You see --, because this is no longer worth it. 
The thought of you and i, together forever 
No longer strikes me as perfect 
 
Im trapped im stuck. I need a way out. I wish 
I knew what was in your head, its been too 
Long --, although these thoughts are wrong. -- 
I feel this temptations too strong 
 
I got ta snap. This -- this fucking ball and chain, 
 
You. Won'T let go this fucking ball and chain. -- 
Has got me acting like your enemy and i don't 
Know what i want. Anymore. this ball and chain. 
Has got me running for the back door. 
 
I wish i could go-but, you won't let go
