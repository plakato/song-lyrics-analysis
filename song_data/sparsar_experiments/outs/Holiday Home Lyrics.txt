Holiday Home Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

Put all our cards away.
Read the look on your face.
All other games we play.
Break the chain.

Cos it's a holiday home.
Two minutes too far away.
What can you tell the other one.
Dirty fiction can you call my name.

Dancing girls on my mind.
Patterns I've made before.
Don't want you here no more.
Call my name.

Cos it's a holiday home.
Two minutes too far away.
What can you tell the other one.
Dirty fiction can you call my name.

Cos it's a holiday home.
Two minutes too far away.
What can you tell the other one.
Dirty fiction can't give you away.

Put all our cards away.
Read the look on your face.
All other games we play.
Break the chain.

Cos it's a holiday home.
Two minutes too far away.
What can you tell the other one.
Dirty fiction can't give you away.

Cos it's a holiday home.
Two minutes too far away.
What can you tell the other one.
Dirty fiction can you call my name.
