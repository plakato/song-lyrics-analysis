Cardinals Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.


Cardinal crashed into my window, I think he might die.
I'll plan him a funeral, I'll read his last rites.
Cause I know what he saw in that reflection of light.
On the glass was a better life.

Staring at a hole in your chest that's been dug there for decades.
American broken promises.
Caught between the lies you've been fed.
And a war with your bloodstream.
I should have been there when you needed a friend.
I was off on my own again.
Selfish and stupid.

So if you call me back or let me in.
I swear I'll never let you down again.
I know the devil you've been fighting with.
I swear I'll never let you down again.

I had that nightmare again.
You're seven and helpless, angry as hell.
And you balled up your fists but I laughed at your swings.
And I beat you half-conscious.
I know that I failed you, woke up in a sweat.
I want those years back.

So if you call me back or let me in.
I swear I'll never let you down again.
I know the devil you've been fighting with.
I swear I'll never let you down again.

We're no saviors if we can't save our brothers.

So if you call me back or let me in.
I swear I'll never let you down again.
I know the devil you've been fighting with.
I swear I'll never let you down again.
