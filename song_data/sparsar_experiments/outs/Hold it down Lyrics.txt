Hold it down Lyrics
by 4hero.

Move Your body.
Now Stop.
Move your mind.
Cause in this space and time.
There are more than jewels out there that shine.
I mean Hold it down.
Stop acting a clown.
Cause the things you do are causing not to found.
Be afraid.
It is not about what does not exist.
If i was to believe everything you said i'd end up believing the grass is red.
Get excited.
Folks acting pure alone.
Your actions are something that should be guided.
Value meant alone .........

Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.

What you need to do is stop.
Bang goes the POP.
Blowing up New York and so are we distraught.
For all to see.
A Feeling is all for me.
Please don't try to bust that shit on me.

Now all some do is walk.
No thanks for what they got.
With an attitude that's fit for hell to rot.
Whose gonna take the way.
Destination seams so fake.
They clocking, times clicking.
Your late, your late.

Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.
Hold it down.

I claim no credit at all.
