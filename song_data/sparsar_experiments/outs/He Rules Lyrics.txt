He Rules Lyrics
by 702.

He rules.
Little rules, little rules.
He's as cute as can be.
Sharp as a tack.
He's a brother like no other.
And he's all that.
He rules.
Little rules, little rules.
He's got plenty of cheese.
If you know what I mean.
He's s charismatic addict.
And as fly as can be.

Nobody's ever been down for me like him.
He calls the shots every where he goes.
He's the kind of mouse everybody wants to know.
I know you think I'm crazy.
But he's my blood, my blood.
You cats better not mess with us.
Unless you wanna get roughed up.

He rules.
Little rules, little rules.
He's as cute as can be.
Sharp as a tack.
He's a brother like no other.
And he's all that.
He rules.
Little rules, little rules.
He's got plenty of cheese.
If you know what I mean.
He's s charismatic addict.
And as fly as can be.

We keep it all in the family.
That's how we do.
He never leaves my side no matter where I go.
He's a brother I always wanted and more.
Sometimes we just act crazy.
Cause we're just kids, just kids.
He'll do anything I ask him to.
And he don't even care what it is, yeah, yeah.

He rules.
Little rules, little rules.
He's as cute as can be.
Sharp as a tack.
He's a brother like no other.
And he's all that.
He rules.
Little rules, little rules.
He's got plenty of cheese.
If you know what I mean.
He's s charismatic addict.
And as fly as can be.

Little has the world in the palm in his hands, ooh.
He can do no wrong in their eyes.
Everybody needs a Stuart Little, yeah.
He'll have you laughing all the time.

Uh, uh, uh, uh.
Say Stuart.

Say Stuart.

Can you hear me say Stuart?
On the right say Stuart.
On the left say Stuart.
In the middle say Stuart.
Come on Little Stuart come on whoo!

He rules.
Little rules, little rules.
He's as cute as can be.
Sharp as a tack.
He's a brother like no other.
And he's all that.
He rules.
Little rules, little rules.
He's got plenty of cheese.
If you know what I mean.
He's s charismatic addict.
And as fly as can be.

Stuart Little, Stuart Little.
