Jet Black Heart Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


Everybody'S got their demons 
Even wide awake or dreaming 
I'm the one who ends up leaving 
Make it: okay, 
See a war. I wan na fight it 
See a match. I wan na strike it 
Every fire I've ignited 
Faded to grey 
 
But. Now that I'm broken 
Now that you know it 
Caught up in a moment, 
Can you see inside 
, 
Cause I've got a jet black heart 
_And, there's a hurricane underneath it 
Trying to keep us apart. 
I write with a poison pen_ 
But these chemicals moving between us 
Are, the reason to start again: 
 
Now, I'm holding on for dear life, 
There's, no way that we could rewind 
Maybe, there's nothing after midnight. 
That could make you stay 
 
But. Now I'm broken 
And. Now that you know it 
Caught up in a moment, 
Can you see inside 
, 
Cause I've got a jet black heart 
And, there's a hurricane underneath it 
Trying to keep us apart. 
I write with a poison pen 
But these chemicals moving between us 
Are. The reason to start again, 
 
The blood in my veins, is made up of mistakes. 
Let'S forget who we are and dive into the dark. 
As we burst into color returning to life, 
 
Cause. I'Ve got a jet black heart 
_And, there's a hurricane underneath it 
Trying to keep us apart. 
I write with a poison pen 
But these chemicals moving between us 
Are, the reason to start again_
