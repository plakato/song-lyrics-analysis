Yo, you.
Better watch for the potholes.
I take that L no loss tho.
I Dash the blunt no Roscoe.
Piff wholesale no Costco.
Tryna keep the cost low.
Need plaques like floss though.
And A Cadillac to drive slow.
Dinner plates, five course.
Takin flights in Concords.
Mile high like the Broncos.
I flow Niagra Falls tho.
Betta grab ya poncho.
Cause its about to downpour.
And don't Niagra Fall bro.
That fall is kinda long tho.
don't  look  down.
Leaders.
Leaders help you follow.
So where I go they all go.
My niggas who I ride for.
Yo girl so hard to look at.
Talk about an eye sore.
Put my flow in a large bowl.
Could mix the shit with hot sauce.
Please stop with these knockoffs.
Fake polo and izod.
Gotta skate cuz im bored.
Stick to bein my boss.
Weed and brew with my boys.
Yall deserve an encore.
Only those who been there.
Will be with me when I'm on.
So stop callin my phone.
Get used to the dial tones.
And please form a line bro.
Above average is my norm.
Bandwagon? Hop on.
Lucky we saved ya spot dog.

It's pure gold in rhyme form.
You gotta let my style form.
Breakin Denver Nuggets like styrofaum.
You write a song but in real life your style is gone.

All my niggas tryna come up, it ain't easy.
So we just enjoyin a day when lifes easy.
Told you that I'm wifin the game I ain't cheatin.
Believe me, believe me.
All my niggas tryna come up, it ain't easy.
So we just enjoyin a day when lifes easy.
Told you that I'm wifin the game I ain't cheatin.
Believe me, believe me.
