Date Night Lyrics
by Xo On The Beat.


Doughboy I've been sippin' lean, since'93 
I've been smoking. Now since'93 
 
If, it don't got a seal, don't bring it my way. 
You niggas be stapn. No lean 
You niggas be cuttin', codeine, 
You, niggas, no codeine, fiend, I'm a codeine, fiend 
I, don't want it unless it come with the sale. 
Prescription drugs is all a nigga have 
But. This is the green hi-tech lean, 
Rock fuck grape. I don't give a damn. 
I want to lean 
 
 X.O. On The Beat 
I had a date with codeine. 
She hit my cup right by me. 
I had a date with codeine, 
 
Four different colors, I'm sippin' 
I had an orgy with codeine 
Four different colors, I'm sippin' 
I had an orgy with codeine 
Sippin' on four different colors 
Sippin' on four different colors 
I had an orgy with codeine. 
I had an orgy with codeine-deine-deine 
 
 X.O. On the Beat 
All up in my drank 
Just might make her my lady 
But it feelin', so crazy, 
Yea, I'm feeling so crazy. 
Something like Bombay 
Young, nigga, feelin', so lazy, 
, 
Big Moe. All in my cup got me feelin', so strange 
Esco gave me the Sprite and I dropped a whole 8 
 
 X.O. On the Beat 
I can't leave drank alone 
It's, all up in my styrofoam 
Codeine. All up in my cup 
I see when I'm picking her up 
It feel like I'm falling In love. 
 Got ta rush. I wan na. Take it slow, so slow. 
Got me scratching DJ, Screw 
I feel like Big Moe 
You know, I'm leanin', I might dose off anytime 
It ain't nothin', but that barnyard on my mind, 
 
I had a date with codeine, 
, 
The, purple, the red and the green 
It dosen't matter to me. 
As long as that shit is codeine. 
Two styrofoam green lean 
Sippin' that M-O-E 
And, I'm pimpin' on bitches, like C 
I, went to sleep on the lean 
I, see Pimp C in my dreams, 
I got a pint in my dreams. 
I pour it up with my team. 
Whole team gone lean B 
Probably. Why them niggas love me: 
I pump, a Perc for Atlanta 
I broke the bitches for money. 
All of my diamonds. They shining 
None of my diamonds, is mucky 
I pour the lean with King Johnny
