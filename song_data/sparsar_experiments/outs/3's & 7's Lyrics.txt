3's & 7's Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.

Lie, lie to my face.
Tell me it ain't nothing.
That's what I wanna hear.

Take the lie to the grave.
That's what an old friend told me.
Look what it did for him.

The truth hurts so bad.
Wouldn't you say? So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss.
Then I'm in heaven now.

Run, you'll never escape.
You'll see you go nowhere.
Based on who you appear.

Broke, laid to waste.
Turn into sweet nothings.
Kiss you goodbye.

Keep going over and over again.
To never ending places I've never been.
No one's catching on, calling my bluff.
The Devil made me holier than every man.

What'd you do? Say it with a smile.
Boy, making us all forget.
What'd you do? Say it with a smile.
Boy, making us all forget.
Making us all forget, making us all forget.
