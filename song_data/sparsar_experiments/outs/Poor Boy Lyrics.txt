Poor Boy Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

I used to drive my truck ‘cross the train tracks, 
A hard day's work piled up in the back 
Muddy boots and a grease stained Atlanta Braves cap, yeah 
I was just a poor boy. 
I felt a little outta place on your front. Porch 
The look on your daddy's face when he opened the door 
Everything, he didn't say, told me he wasn't sure 
‘Bout this poor boy, 
 
But, you didn't worry ‘bout. What I wasn't 
You didn't care that I came from nothin' 
All I could give you was my love and 
The key to the heart. 
Of, a poor boy, 
 
I'd crack a smile when them rich boys would look our way. 
I knew that they were thinkin' man. There ain't no way 
He can't keep her happy. No, that girl won't ever stay 
With that poor boy, 
 
But, you didn't worry ‘bout. What I wasn't 
You didn't care that I came from nothin' 
All I could give you was my love and 
The key to the heart: 
Of, a poor boy, 
 
Baby! We just kept on rockin' on 
In a beat up truck a Keith Whitley song 
Girl your heart of gold, 
Proved ‘em, all wrong 
 
‘Cause. You didn't worry ‘bout what I wasn't 
You didn't care that I came from nothin' 
All I could give you was my love and 
The key to the heart. 
Of, a poor boy. 
I was just a poor boy: 
You loved a poor boy, yeah
