Lost on the Moon Lyrics
by WoodenToaster.


Saying goes that when you're stuck on a mountain.
You try to go up, you try to go down, you turn around.
To face a wall so you can face yourself.
Realizing you've made a mistake.

And you are being stuck on the moon.
Like the rest of us, trying to make sense of it.
Crying cause we don't have any reason.
We're alone together, cause we all.
Share the very same crime.

Some will say that this is not going to last long.
Some will say that if we try we can't go wrong.
As time goes on we are not leaving this place.
Cause when we'll come back we lose our track of time and space.

So together we are all lost on the moon.
We all share our home on the moon, we.
Forever we are lost on the moon, together.
We pay your crime on the moon.

And you are being stuck on the moon.
Like the rest of us, trying to make sense of it.
Crying cause we don't have any reason.
We're alone together, cause we all.
Share the very same crime.

Some will say that this is not going to last long.

Cause when we'll come back we lose our track of time and space.

So together we are all lost on the moon.
We all share our home on the moon, we.
Forever we are lost on the moon, together.
We pay your crime on the moon.
