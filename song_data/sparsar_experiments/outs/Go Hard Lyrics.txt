Go Hard Lyrics
by Z-Trip.

I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from 
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from 
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from 
I think it's time for me to Go hard as the hood I'm from 
 
If you could. You would get rid of me 
What! You gon'! Do when a nigga got to go hard 
But! I won't. Let you get to me. 
You should already figure I'ma go hard. 
 
If! You were as real as me: 
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard, 
Makin', money, ain't shit to me, 
This in my veins, and it gets to my heart, 
 
So I am. I will I gots to go. 
You got another way to live. You gots to go on. 
I am gettin' it in until the end 
I got to go, go, go, go, go hard, 
 
I, go the hardest flow, so retard 
I'm, disgusted with myself I mean ughh were. Do I start 
First? I stand around and vomit. Then I shit up on it. 
Fuck the beat up so bad. Won'T no body get up on it. 
 
I flow, sick, nigga, how sick sea sick 
Got your hand out. Don'T look at me bitch 
You lookin' at who made me rich 
You lookin' at who made me rich 
 
I have some wins, some losses, 
Just a life of a god, damn boss's 
With, the top off lookin' for a girl 
With a ass as fat as Tracy. Roselet 
 
This is dope, as is get 
Dope as a mother. Fuckin' acid trip 
Fly as 57 passengers, 
This finna, be another classic bitch, 
 
Everybody know I get it 
If you want. It then get at it. 
But I ain't gon'. Have it 
No? I ain't gon', have it 
 
If you could you would get rid of me 
What you gon', do when a nigga got to go hard 
But? I won't. Let you get to me. 
You should already figure I'ma go hard. 
 
If! You were as real as me. 
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard, 
Makin' money, ain't shit to me, 
This in my veins, and it gets to my heart, 
 
So I am. I will I gots to go. 
You got another way to live. You gots to go on. 
I am gettin' it in until the end 
I got to go, go, go, go, go hard, 
, 
I, ain't, never been scared. 
Never been a type to bite. My words 
When I came up. Y'All gave me shit 
Now, I'm finna make y'all eat them. Turds 
 
Always said what the fuck I felt 
Gon' head spit that murder I wrote 
Man, I don't care what you felt 
Fuck you nigga. I know I'm dope 
 
Dope, like I'm comin', to get my all 
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall. 
Felt like niggas, was stuntin' on me, 
Funny. How I'm flyer then them all 
 
Now, I'm at the top ain't know where to go. Now 
Instead of me, she gon' go down 
Maybe, I would of slowed down. If I knew 
What I knew now 
 
I'm Scooby. I know I'm dumb 
It's a fuckin' get old, but it's good. I'M young 
But, my heart get cold as the hood, I'm from 
Tell me what it take to be numba one 
 
I, guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be 
But. Here'S one thing you got to hear: 
I'ma tell you, like George Bush, told me 
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm out of here 
 
If, you could you would get rid of me 
What you gon', do when a nigga got to go hard 
But. I won't let you get to me. 
You should already figure I'ma go hard, 
 
If, you were as real as me. 
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard, 
Makin', money, ain't shit to me, 
This in my veins, and it gets to my heart. 
 
So, I am, I will I gots to go. 
You got another way to live. You gots to go on. 
I am gettin' it in until the end 
I got to go, go, go, go, go hard, 
, 
I, think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from 
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from 
I. Think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from 
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from 
 
If you could, you would get rid of me 
What! You gon' do when a nigga got to go hard 
But. I won't let you get to me. 
You should already figure I'ma go hard, 
 
If, you were as real as me. 
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard, 
Makin', money, ain't shit to me, 
This in my veins, and it gets to my heart. 
 
So, I am, I will I gots to go. 
You got another way to live. You gots to go on, 
I am gettin' it in until the end 
I got to go, go, go, go, go hard
