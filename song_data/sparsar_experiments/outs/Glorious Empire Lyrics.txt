Glorious Empire Lyrics
by Voice.

They came from the east on horses fast as the wind.
And death was their permanent companion.
Their nameless souls forced their bloody way.
At the creation of their new kingdom.

I, I have a dream.
Of liberty and peace.
And the faith in oour glorious empire.
You powerful games.
Now I lie at the ground.
Don't let me die alone.

Their king is a devil, his power the pain.
His warriors are strong but blind in their hearts.
With an iron hand he takes what he wants.
On his way to eternal darkness.

I, I have a dream.
Of liberty and peace.
And the faith in our glorious empire.
You powerful games.
Now I lie at the ground.
Don't let me die alone.
I, I have a dream.
Of liberty and peace.
And the faith in our glorious empire.
You powerful games.
Now I lie at the ground.
Let's fight side by side.

I've been killed in action.
Been knocked down.
Feel my powers fade away.
What else can I do.
To escape this inglorious fate?

I, I have a dream.
Of liberty and peace.
And the faith in our glorious empire.
You powerful games.
Now I lie at the ground.
Don't let me die alone.
I, I have a dream.
Of liberty and peace.
And the faith in our glorious empire.
You powerful games.
Now I lie at the ground.
Let's fight side by side.
