Penetrate Lyrics
by Unholy Homies.

Reek The Cleric.
Highest nigga on the planet.
Don't take a bitch no where unless I take her for granted.

I just managed to fuck I ain't plan it.
It's prolly how my Jordan's laced up or how I'm standin.
Fuck a government official.
They feed us bullshit so I suggest you keep a tissue.
Tell the congress go somewhere and eat a missile.
When will it stop.
They'll prolly throw away the key if life was a lock.
And until I'm at the top.
Of a pinnacle.
My thoughts stay cynical.
Only believe the literal.
Music for the soul lyrics soo fuckin spiritual.
Reek the mc and the m is for mystical.

I be on the highway meditating.
fifth gear blunt lit damn near levitating deep thoughts dark thoughts ya bitch let me penetrate it.

She tell what you wanna hear and you lovin it.
Fuck a bitch.
These women as grimy as the government.
Ill have this whole earth skipping a solstice.
Ya soul stiff.
Like its cryogenically frozen.
I'm a cool dude but bitches say I'm the coldest.
But on the other hand.
My pineal gland focused.
I pop tabs and question my own existence.
Understand there's no fame without persistence.
To cheap to pay attention but I still listen.
Me and niggas got no religion.

I be on the highway levitating fifth gear blunt lit damn near meditation deep.
thoughts dark thoughts ya bitch let me penetrate it.
