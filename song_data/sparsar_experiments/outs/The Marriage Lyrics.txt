The Marriage Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

I understand you needing.
And wanting is no crime.
But I can't help feeling.
That you and your mother.
Are just wasting your time.

Choosing Saturdays in Summer.
Oh, I dare you to wear white.
Love is just a moment of giving.
And marriage is when we admit.
Our parents were right.

I just don't understand it.
What makes our love a sin.
How can it make that difference.
If you and I are wearing.
That bloody, bloody ring.

If I share my bed with you.
Must I also share my life.
Love is just a moment of giving.
And marriage is when we admit.
Our parents were right.

You just don't understand it.
This tender trap we're in.
Those glossy catalogues of couples.
Are cashing in.
On happiness again and again.

So drag me to the altar.
And I'll make my sacrifice.
Love is just a moment of giving.
And marriage is when we admit.
Our parents were right.

Marriage is when we admit.
Our parents were right.
Just as marriage is when we admit.
Our parents were probably right.
