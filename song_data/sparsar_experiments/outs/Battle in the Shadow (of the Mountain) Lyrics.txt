Battle in the Shadow (of the Mountain) Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

Time approaches!

Whispers fill the waiting hollows.
Dread comes forth and bleeds the sky.
Look no further than tomorrow.
No mistake they've come to die.
Overcome and fear no more.
Come admire the night's reflection.
Fires on the hills below.
Darkness stands for death's inspection.
Phantoms standing row by row.
Mourn the beauty lost in war.

He'll slit throats and claim victory with haste.

Battle in the shadow of the mountain.

Fire rises filling the hearts and the.
Eyes, raging, setting the fury alight.

No subjection!

Battle frenzy moves him forward.
Sword has warped his mind and soul.
Takes no heed of side or standard.
All will fall and he will grow.
Every death adds to his strength.
Filled with lust for endless ruin.
Fate will sing it's wicked call.
With the carnage done and through him.
He will see he's killed them all.
Drenched in blood of innocents.

Battle in the shadow of the mountain.

Weeks and weeks could be spent.
Collecting the bodies that litter the mountainside.
But instead they're left as reminders of the fucking bloodbath.

Filled with sorrow he falls to the floor.
He knows that he is no more.
No more.
