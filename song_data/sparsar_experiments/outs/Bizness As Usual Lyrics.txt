Bizness As Usual Lyrics
by Wrekonize.


Bizness goes on as usual. 
Except that my brother is dead, 
He was 25 and very much alive. 
But the dreams have all been blasted from his head. 
 
They place bets and watch the working man run like a race horse, 
Back and forth fighting in a minimum wage war. 
Riding our high horse, stable unpaid for 
Hoof marks to push start all terrain war. 
I'M asking. Can you see it now, 
Asking for rations of oxygen for breathing 
For, now breathe free ya'll make sure to breathe deep ya'll 
Wake up from your sleep ya'll. They got us all asleep. Ya'Ll, 
They, televise, medi-ize tellin' lies 
Which, be drivin' me to drink too much. 
Drivin' me to think too much 
About the aids plaque rumors of a super strain 
Indonesia death toll cracks in the Hoover Dam 
All too convenient protection of the homeland 
Sympathy for terrorism, brewin' in the Sudan 
Nothin', but MJ all over the tube man, 
I'm tryin' to survive. What'S a human got, ta do man, 
Extra extra fear, soul on the news, stand 
And the bad one? Is it's funny cuz, it's true man 
The last four years have been stupid, severe 
And, it ain't even the past. It'S the future 
It's! Here we like three blind mice 
To their three times: twice: thrice 
Anti-Christ, commission, drillin', Vermillions, 
G.I.'s, bite bullets, welcome to the new millenium
