I Know It's Too Soon Lyrics
by X Blake Freeman X.


I know it's too soon to make a song about cha'.
I know barely enough about cha' but maybe I just have ta'.
Tell these people about cha' and everything I know.
And pretend to be a big shot ‘til all my money blows.

Cause I'm trying to win your heart.
But I can't do that when I'm stuck at the start.
Stuck worried about these other stars.
Like I'm in a footrace with racecars.
We got different plans, we got different goals.
You're in Nashville and I'm on the road.
So what's that mean?
When I get back your close to home.
I'm legit when I say your beautiful.
I'm legit when I say you're the prettiest.
Much love to my past girls.
But honey you're the top of my wish list.
I wanna show you off the best way I know how.
For thousand on my Facebook or hundreds in my crowd.

I know it's too soon to make a song about cha'.
I know barely enough about cha' but maybe I just have ta'.
Tell these people about cha' and everything I know.
And pretend to be a big shot ‘til all my money blows.

If you ever were to leave me, like leave me just for the hell of it.
I'd still brag to all my friends, like you and I were still relevant.
I'd tell em' about this girl I met as if I met her only yesterday.
Go on and on about your looks and just watch the jaw drops escalate.
That's real talk, that's true intentions.
All the truth and zero fiction.
Much love to my past girls.
But honey you're the one that I'm truly missin'.
I wanna see you right now and I wish that I could come over.
You got Netflix,.
I'll get a pizza, and you could rest your head on my shoulder.
And kiss me... you can kiss me... just kiss me... just kiss me.

I know it's too soon to make a song about cha'.
I know barely enough about cha' but maybe I just have ta'.
Tell these people about cha' and everything I know.
And pretend to be a big shot ‘til all my money blows.

I know it's too soon to make a song about cha'.
I know barely enough about cha' but maybe I just have ta'.
Tell these people about cha' and everything I know.
And pretend to be a big shot ‘til all my money blows.
