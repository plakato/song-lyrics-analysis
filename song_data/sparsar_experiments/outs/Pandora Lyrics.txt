Pandora Lyrics
by Bodi.


I never meant to hurt you.
No intent to bring you down or desert you.
If I'd known the choice I made.
The same that sends cats to their grave.
Had given you everything you never wanted.
I would've killed curiosity, I promise.
But I let the monsters surface.
Hope left closed, I'm looking for a purpose.
I'd be the out cause if I could.
Erase me with the flaws where I stood.
Spend days working to correct.
Everything left in the caves of my chest, I'm.
Walking til my feet are broken, talking til my speech is golden.
Knocking but the doors will open, only when my tongue is frozen.
Hopin but I'm floatin never, wrote inside these storms I've weathered.
Chokin on these smokin embers, cold as winter's rose December.
Feathers never on my back, see the snowfall fade to black.
Grasp as the seconds pass, relapse into aftermath.
Master class on fractured past, plaster caste to tragic mask.
Laughing last disaster tracks me back to house of shattered glass.
Crash down, but made no sound.
Homeward bound through a one horse ghost town.
Toast the ground that boasted a crown.
Found broken bottles hollow like regrets I model.
El Diablo's probably coming for me next.
So my steps burn shadows in the valley of death.
I guess it's for the best that I move on now.
Bow then it's curtains and go and join the crowd.
How will this end, or does it really ever?
Coda with the stars, my atoms are forever.
Remember that we sew with the same cloth.
That we're cut from, so remain when the frame's lost.
Remain when the frame's lost.
Remember that we sew with the same cloth.
That we're cut from, so remain when the frame's lost.
