IHOP Lyrics
by Twitchy.


Sip syrup, while i stirrup.
The recipe.
A bunch of fucking lines thatll show up the rest of me.
Them wicked ass lines.
With them witty ass rhymes.
Thatll sound professional.
Words on lock make you seem obsessional.
The resident of evils here to show you that hes back like sequel.
The mircale , of lyricle ability.
On the tranquillty facility.
Soon will be asked.
If i can change up the contrast.
Change up the game.
A little fame to my name.
With the passion, of some action.
Show the groupies satisfaction.
Is the whole concept.
Pause, for applause.
Break the laws, break some jaws.
That hood rat shit.
All these rappers spit.
But nothing makes sense.
So i show em whos intense.
But I get what i deserve.
And you can tell that ive changed but only if you observe.

So.
Lets.
Stop.
For some soda pop and IHOP.
Celetebrate what weve done.
See what we become.
Relize this life is really just for fun.
Um.

Young mind, still excellent.
Yet everything ive done so far is irrelevant.
A phchpotic robotic on chronic demonic with a flow as fast as sonic.
Is what really decribes me.
I wanna go far for till these magazines vibe me.
The culprit of the bogus hocus pocus.
That your hearin on the radio.
Attackin the media with fire, iron bars, shiny cars, fuckin up your stereo.
Mery go, round the globe, searchin for her favorite rapper.
Not some fake backstabber.
Leave the game immedialty.
Your wills not as clean as me.
Fix it up.
Your swag you can't just mix it up.
Gotta be yourself.
Not me one no else.
Recitting all my writing.
With precision of a vision.
That i'll make it.
See my dream and imma take it.
Everything is purple.
And is mixed up like a cirlce.
Imma.
Stay stong, and rap long.
Cause my career i fear is here for a meaning.
The game is commitmint and im here for a beating.
