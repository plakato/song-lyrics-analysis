Hot Mess Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Clothes scattered across the bedroom floor.
Soaking wet towel hanging on the door.
Looks like a hurricane just came through.
Her makeup covers up.
Every inch of the counter top.
She's slappin' on a little bit of strawberry lip gloss.
She's ready to rock.

She's my hot mess, in a sundress.
Got my heart beating out of my chest.
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star.
She's got hazel eyes and a wild side.
Lightin' up the room with her smokey little smile.
Burnin' up and down, turning them heads.
She's my little hot mess.

When she gets to dancin' to the band.
Them shoes gonna wind up in her hand.
Barefoot and groovin' like nobody's watchin'.
She gonna cut up and drink a little.
Play them boys like a bluegrass fiddle.
The rave of the party's at.
Oh she's right there in the middle.

She's my hot mess, in a sundress.
Got my heart beating out of my chest.
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star.
She's got hazel eyes and a wild side.
Lightin' up the room with her smokey little smile.
Burnin' up and down, turning them heads.
She's my little hot mess.

Every guy in here tonight, wants to take her home.
But in the morning she's gonna wake up, with my t-shirt on.

She's my hot mess, in a sundress.
Got my heart beating out of my chest.
Country girl come to town looking like a rock star.
She's got hazel eyes and a wild side.
Lightin' up the room with her smokey little smile.
Burnin' up and down, turning them heads.
She's my little hot mess.
