The Hole Lyrics
by X-Raided  (a.k.a. Nefarious).

Stepped of the bus handcuff and shackles.
Hella tight on my ankles cuz the cops an asshole.
Left Tracy headed to new Folsom Penaten.
82 point strong but left with 4 to the millenium.
Can't have fucc visits no more.
Southerners is still trippin so we still at war.
I heard niggas wanna see me dead.
I heard they waitin on me.
With bonecrushers hatin on me.
And I'm on my only.
The Northern Cali Crip carved your shadow.
Seems like I'm on my own when it's time to battle.
Niggas have to tell the cops everything they know.
It ain't the way it used to be homie that's for sure.
My nigga Ernest Powell told me how it used to be.
Nowadays snitches run the penitentiary.
Real niggas got it bad if they ache to beef.
Can't get a job so you be stuck in the cell watchin T.V.
I hit the yard wit a mean mug.
I ain't the biggest nigga but I gives mean fucc.
You talk shit to my low cuz you on swoll.
Bring your knife to the yard nigga.
We goin to the hole.

You better bring your knife to the yard.
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard.
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard.
I gives a fucc if you swoll.
We goin to the hole.

Now I'm in the hole.
I think I'm goin crazy.
Paranoid thinkin everybody tryin to play me.
Fade me.
Feelin like I'm stuck in a maze.
Cuz I ain't seen the sun in 66 days.
Hairs in braids stickin up like Coolio.
No deodorant No toothpaste cuz you a ho.
Put me in the cross so I had to blast ya.
You probably gonna snitch on me I wouldn't put it paste ya.
Niggas would rather snitch than retaliate.
Ain't given a fucc about the shoe.
Cuz I ain't got no date.
And were they wrong I wish I was awol.
Instead of sittin in the cell starin at a fuccin wall.
If you ever done time you know just what I'm feelin.
Layin on your bunk countin the cracks in the ceilin.
Thinkin bout all the shit you did in the past.
When I get out the hole I'm get your snitchin ass mothafucca.

You better bring your knife to the yard.
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard.
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard.
I gives a fucc if you swoll.
We goin to the hole.
You better bring your knife to the yard.
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard.
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard.
I gives a fucc if you swoll.
We goin to the hole.

Niggas say what they gonna do when they see me.
But when they see me but when they be askin for autographs.
That's on the GB.
In the pen steady thuggin.
Like flesh &amp; bone.
Pull out a Kisu.
Hit 'em in the neck then I'm gone.
In the pen you meet all sorts of kind a niggas.
With different attitudes everybody think they bigga.
Then the next man.
But this savage can't be goin out like the average.
So back up off the X man.
Bustin down with the machine.
It's Africans and Northerners and cops paccin mini 14s.
Can't stop, won't stop the emotion.
Gotta stand strong it be on in new Folsom.
Step out the cell peep the yard feel the tension.
Shit be goin on that a nigga can't mention.
Keep my bacc against the wall.
Watchin the drama as it unfolds.
It's riot time.
We goin to the hole.

You better bring your knife to the yard.
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard.
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard.
Cuz the Northern Cali Car be pullin ho calls.
You better bring your knife to the yard.
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard.
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard.
Igives a fucc if you swoll.
We goin to the hole...nigga.
