OMG Lyrics
by Arash.


Oh My God.

Snoop Dogg.

Club is packed, I rap the rap. Ladies are in here from front to back.

And They love my soul, I reply: baby girl, don't you know that I am the fly?

Hands in the sky, don't ask why!
Party on down with a big bow wow. I got style, got flare. Got you right there,.
got enough stock to make you do that dance.

So come on, come all. just havin' a ball.

Be Aware of the owner cause the owner's a Dogg! I got y'all back off the wall.

Just let me know... know... know....
I like the way that you talk, I like the way that you walk.

Crash! Boom! Bang! You're so beautiful.
Wait till we kiss, give me your lips. Crash! Boom! Bang! You're so beautiful.
I'm gonna make you say Oh My God.

Female Vocals.

Wow! Oh My God..
Oh my God!
I make you wanna say... Oh My God.

Baby, baby wanna be my lady? Let's take a ride in my blue Mercedes.

Green grass, sitting on the beanbag. Close your eyes so that the dream lasts.

No fadin' away just Blazing Ray. Night will turn to amazing day.

You and I, I and you, let's do what lovers do....
Do that dance, so do that dance.

Just let me know... know... know....
I like the way that you talk, I like the way that you walk.

Crash! Boom! Bang! You're so beautiful.
Wait till we kiss, give me your lips. Crash! Boom! Bang! You're so beautiful.
I'm gonna give you everything you want!

Female + Snoop Dogg's vocals.

Wow! Oh My God..
Oh my God!
I make you wanna say... Oh My God.
