Feather Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


Take it out on me.
Try to help out, you push back, you push back.
You take it out on me.
No matter what, you know that, you know that.

I will lift you up.
For now and forever.
I will lift you up.
Til you're light as a feather.
I know times are tough.
When you're under pressure.
I will lift you up.
Til you're light as a feather.
I will lift you up.

I know you need somebody.
Try to act like it's alright, it's alright.
Cause when you need somebody.
No matter what, you know I, you know I.

I will lift you up.
For now and forever.
I will lift you up.
Til you're light as a feather.
I know times are tough.
When you're under pressure.
I will lift you up.
Til you're light as a feather.
I will lift you up.

I will lift you up.
For now and forever.
I will lift you up.
Til you're light as a feather.
I know times are tough.
When you're under pressure.
I will lift you up.
Til you're light as a feather.
I will lift you up.
