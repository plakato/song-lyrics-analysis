Blue Spark Lyrics
by X.

Blue spark.
He waits in a beach apartment, blue spark.
Thousands of lights, thousands of people.
She's forgotten him for the bodies around her.
Blue shock, exchange blue shock, exchange blue spark.
What goes between the eyes downtown, blue spark.
Oh, loudspeakers and search lights the boulevard.
She comes home later just to give him.
Blue shock, exchange blue shock, exchange blue spark.
Blue spark, blue spark.
