Sellout Lyrics
by The Word Alive.


Waiting for waiting for conviction.
Waiting for waiting for connection.
Everybody is searching for someone!

I'm still searching for direction.
I'm still trying to find my way out.
I won't pretend that I'm alright with settling left and right.

I'm not seeking protection.
I'm just seeking redemption.

Waiting for waiting for conviction.
Waiting for waiting for connection.
Everybody is searching for substance.
Waiting for waiting for my outcome.
Waiting for waiting for ascension.
Everybody is searching for someone!

Don't get lost inside your head.
Unlock the mysteries within.
Unlock the mysteries!
Unlock the mysteries!

Waiting for waiting for conviction.
Waiting for waiting for connection.
Everybody is searching for substance.
Waiting for waiting for my outcome.
Waiting for waiting for ascension.
Everybody is searching for someone!

Breakdown.
You're searching for yourself!
You're searching for yourself!

Will they remember me?
Everything's empty but I see the light.
I'll apologize.
Just come back, just come back.
Will you remember me?
Everything's empty and I lost the fight.
I'll apologize.
Just come back, just come backâ€¦
Just come back! Just come back!
