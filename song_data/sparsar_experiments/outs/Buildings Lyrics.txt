Buildings Lyrics
by Yung Lean.

Yung Lean.
Leandoer.
Euros in my bank account.
I've got foreign diners on my plate.
Swervin' on these bank accounts.
Pounds go down ? bitch it's too late.
Foreign foreign bitch I'm foreign.
Let these fuckers know I'm up to date.
Shawty wanna celebrate but.
All my boys got stacks of cake.
Picked up pepper on the streets, all white.
Me and ? on the fuckin jetski.
Sadboys tattoo in Times New Roman.
I let em know not to hold me I let them know I'm the omen.
Dont get pissed if you jack my style.
Cause I know you're too slow man.
Hannibal Lecter, ballin inspector.
100 dollar bills, poppin pills, sippin nectar.
100 million films on my TV projector.
Leave the bodies in my jetski.
Pick them up imma collector.
Bitch I'm harmony korine.
In my whole life I'm the director.
And my team Sadboys get the check bruh.
Don't forget to sign off, killed the rap game.
Leave the body with the spine off.
Lean, lean, Leandoer.

GTBSB in the building.
Shawty wanna fuck.
I don't not know how to be feelin'.
Rolex in my 'rari.
GTBS army.
Shawty I be ballin'.
Shawty I be ballin'.
GTB SB in the building.
Shawty wanna fuck.
I don't not know how to be feelin'.
Rolex in my 'rari.
GTBS army.
Shawty I be ballin'.
Shawty I be ballin'.

Thaiboy Digital.
Ballin' ballin GTBS army.
Pullin' up in rari.
Everything be foreign.
Running with them Sadboys.
Money we be pourin'.
Battles they be borin'.
Foreign we be tourin.

Robotic instincts got metallic dreams.
Burberry tees, walkin' on ?
10 soda cans in if you wanna drink.
Razor blade in my fist.
You can get extinct.
I got glue on my Ferragamo linen shirt.
In my house but it's feelin' like I'm in a church.
Barbed wire on the fence you can't get inside.
Got a wall full of knives if you wanna die.
CDG tee shirt I got no heart.
Missing me, my shoes cost a gold car.
GTBSG shield gang.
I was broke, I got paid.
Then I soared up.
