Day the World Turned Day-Glo Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

I clambered over mounds and mounds.
Of polystyrene foam.
And fell into a swimming pool.
Filled with fairy snow.
And watched the world turn day-glo.
You know you know.
The world turned day-glo you know.
I wrenched the nylon curtains back.
As far as they would go.
And peered through perspex window panes.
At the acrylic road.
I drove my polypropolene.
Car on wheels of sponge.
Then pulled into a wimpy bar.
To have a rubber bun.
The X-rays were penetrating.
Through the laytex breeze.
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves.
Fell from the rayon trees.
