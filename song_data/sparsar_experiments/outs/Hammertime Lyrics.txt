Hammertime Lyrics
by Rusko.

U can't touch this.
Don't turn around, uh-oh. Der kommisar's in town, uh-oh.
I heard you on the wireless back in '52. Oh-wah-oh. What did you tell them.
Video killed the radio star.
I wanna rock right now, I'm Rob Base and I came to get down.
I'm not internationally known, but I'm known to rock the microphone.
You can dance if you want to... you can leave your friends behind. Cause your.
Friends don't dance and if they don't dance then they're no friends of mine.
Safety Dance.
Take on me. Take on me. Take me on. Take on me. I'll be gone. When you TAKE.
Stop Hammertime.
Oh, I. I just died in your arms tonight. It must've been something you said.
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can, so I can.
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Together forever and ever to part. Together forever.
Poor old Johnny Ray...said it sid a sahd on the radio and a sid and sool and.
thunder.
C'mon Eileen, too-loo-rah-yay, C'mon Eileen too-loo-rah-yay. Now you have.
Gone, now you have gone. Ohh Eileen. Said c'mon Eileen you're breaking me.
Down, i said too-loo-rah. Now you're too young and clever be singing again.
I said too-rah-loo-rah-too-rah-loo-ah-ya.
