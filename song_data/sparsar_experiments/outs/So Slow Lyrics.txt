So Slow Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.

I can think of a couple of ways to.
Make it feel like a couple of days went by.
That he didn't even cross your mind.
He gave her the dough, and he gave her the Prada.
But you gonna' need a man.
To show you how to love.
A couple of nights, with a couple of knives.
Cutting rugs down the boulevard.
How do you feel, it's how we feel.

When we dance, so slow.
By the way we dance, you'll know.

Put your hands down by your waist side.
You can be my Kelly Kapow.
Like we're going to Bayside.
Get it, school prom wanna put it on.
Try to take it slow, but it's poppin' off tonight.
I wanna keep it one hunned, cause I don't wanna lie.
I'm losing my mind when I'm kissing down your spine.
And it feels like the first time.
I really wanna give it to you till you can't take it no more.

When we dance, so slow.
By the way we dance, you'll know.
So slow, we will go so slow.
