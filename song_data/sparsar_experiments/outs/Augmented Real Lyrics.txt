Augmented Real Lyrics
by Yung Jake.


I'M so real ..., but only on a screen 
I'm doing me., I'm on your scene, 
Take a look around.! You can see it 
It's hard to believe it. 
 
I'm, an Internet digital entity 
That's. Why I'm blowing up these hoes in to me 
These hoes, so real.? They just wan na feel me 
But the they can't touch me.. It'S not the Real D 
 
Get, this money. digital pape-, uh 
They, just tryna hate, bruh, 
They tryna, take my swag. They can have it 
And. I make'em feel like its magic 
 
Just open up the app mane 
I'm on your screen, cause I'm a app mane 
That's. What I turnt into 
I'm, too turnt up. 
 
All. This lean got me feeling, augmented 
Bands came in now. They all spented, 
All, dis green, got me feeling so digital 
I'm, just making nigga feel so physical 
 
I'm real a-a-augmented, real 
I'm, real a-a-augmented, real 
I, keep it one hundred. authentic, feel 
I'm, so real, augmented, real 
 
I'm, a app now.. They just scan me in 
Tryna, get fucked up off this Ambien 
Close your eyes go to sleep hoe 
She! On top of me,
