Beat My Brain Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Beat my brain, take my life.
Make me pay, pay the price.
I'm bad, no good news.
There's nothing left that you can do.

There's a grave and it says my name.
Life is cheap.

Beat my brain with dirty sex.
Take the risk, take my breath.
I'm bored, bored with you.
There's nothing left that you can do.

Standing on the edge, anticipating death of my pain.
