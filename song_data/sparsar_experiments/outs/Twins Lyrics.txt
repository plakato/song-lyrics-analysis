Twins Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.

Body electric
Disconnected
Slow my love, goes
Into shadows through the hollows
Lonely echos, your name
They cry and cry

If. I could go back and find you
I would I'd safely hide you
Twins. Our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearms

Bodies electric
So disconnected
Slow, my love, grows
Into shadows through the hollows
Lonely echos, my mind
They cry and cry

If. I could go back and find you
I. Would I'd safely. Hide you far, from
Those things that haunt you and my heart
Would be inside you

Twins. Our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearms
Twins. Our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearm
