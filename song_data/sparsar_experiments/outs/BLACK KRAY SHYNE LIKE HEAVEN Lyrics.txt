BLACK KRAY SHYNE LIKE HEAVEN Lyrics
by Black Kray.

Foreign diamonds yeah they bling bling.
Hop out my whip i shine like bling bling.
My diamonds yeah they bling bling.
Hop out my whip i shine like bling bling.
Iced out uzi that bitch go bling bling.
My diamonds yeah they bling bling.

Smoking on ashley while i sing sing.
My heart is crying.
I roll up like a dove I'm flying.
Got my beautiful goth money.
Shine like a princess don't mind me.
You can't outshine me.
My halo worth like 10k.
My shorty like 3k.
I stunt with AK.
Okay kay.
Nascar ride on rims man.
Watch me skate away.
Watch me fade away.
Pull up my rari man.
My heart it fade away.
Tears fall like money man.
Watch me fly away.

Shorty i'm sorry mane.

Flying, i'm flying.
Teardrops falling like money.

Shorty can i call you.
Flip phone lonely on the pony.
She said she love me i don't know you.
Im iced out.
Rims on my whip when i pull up.

She slit her wrist and blood falling on money mane.
