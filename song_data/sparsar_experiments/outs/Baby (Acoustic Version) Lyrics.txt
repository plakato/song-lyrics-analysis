Baby (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.

You know you love me, I know you care.
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there.
You are my love, you are my heart.
And we will never, ever, ever be apart.
Are we an item? Girl, quit playin'.
We're just friends, what are you sayin'?
Said there's another, and looked right in my eyes.
My first love broke my heart for the first time.
And I was like baby, baby, baby, no.
I'm like baby, baby, baby, no.
I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh.
I thought you'd always be mine, mine.
Baby, baby, baby, oh.
I'm like baby, baby, baby.
I'm like baby, baby, baby, no.
I thought you'd always be mine.
For you, I would have done whatever.
And I just can't believe we ain't together.
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you.
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring.
Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me.
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream.
I'm goin' down, down, down.
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around.
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh.
I'm like baby, baby, baby.
I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh.
I thought you'd always be mine, mine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone.
I'm gone.
