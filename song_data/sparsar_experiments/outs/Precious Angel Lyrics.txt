Precious Angel Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

Precious angel Under the sun.
How was I to know.
You would be the one.
You showed me.
I was blinded.
You showed me.
I was gone.
How weak is the foundation I was standing upon.

Now the spiritual warfare.
Flesh and blood breaking down.
You've either got faith or you've got unbelief.
There ain't no neutral ground.
The enemy is subtle.
How be it we're deceived.
When the truth is in our hearts.
And we still don't believe.

Shine your light Shine your light on me.

Sister let me tell you.
About a vision that I saw.
Drawing water for your husband.
You were suffering under the law.
You were talking about Buddha And Mohammed in one breath.
But you never mentioned.
The man who died a criminal's death.

I couldn't make it by myself.
I was just too blind to see.
