Beyond The Clouds Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.

You see me smiling with my niggas.
We go hard on the mission.
Deez niggas say they smoking woods.
But the just copping swishers.
She say she can't hit the wood.
Cuz the smoke come to thicker.
I almost pulled her ass out.
She said jk she so silly.
Run up on me like I lack.
I bring his funeral quicker.
I switch back like never before.
I cut him off then i'm dipping.
Who the fuck he think he grippin his bitch still wanna kick it.
I'm in cali with a mixture of the girls a lil bigger.
If she exotic than she got that's the topic my nigga.
Add a hunnid more points for a natural figure.
She looked up at me and said hold up I'm rollin one with ya.
I said okay thats on the way I get as high as can get with her.
Pull off with my boys I give no fuck bout who pulling up.
See me sailing to the shore I'm shading shining for all of us.
Hollow squad the coffin.
fleet will never be crumbled up.
See me smoking uninterrupted I'm posted up high as fuck.
M - E - M - P - H - I - S.
No rest when I hit the deck.
They think I'm tom hanks.
I cast away when i hit the spliff.
Jack Wulf Sparrow thats my name when I hit the ship.
I pull off from the shore heading straight for whoever next.
