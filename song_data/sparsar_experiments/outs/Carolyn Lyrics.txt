Carolyn Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Hey, hey, Carolyn, get into my car.
Oh, oh, oh, kick your feet up on the dashboard.
Hey, hey, Carolyn, we can take it far.
Oh, oh, oh, feel the heat upon the ashphalt.

Follow me down to where the darkness divides.
Come and teach me 'bout the afterlife.
Wild is the night, we see our colors collide.
We got heart, we got an ocean to find.

You can be a queen in my eyes.
We can fall apart for the last time.
Yeah, yeah.

Foot to the plate as falling stars are aligned.
Your reflection in the near side.
Many a saint has tried to take you alive.
Yeah, baby you're a paradigm.

Instrumental.
