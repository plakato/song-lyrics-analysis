Chali 2na Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway.

Chali 2na 
Like that, like that ya, don't stop check it. 
One mo' time for the people out there 
It goes peace --. If you come to see me rebel 
2na-Fish'll come ready like I was Edie, Brickell 
I'm, everlasting! Never will my head expand. 
This Publisher is Clearinghouse. Like I'm Ed McMahon, 
I getcha -- open, like a bullet wound test, the repoitoire 
And I'll connect a right cross to your upper jaw. 
I'M on my toes all my foes. Beware: 
Cause 2na-Fish'll tackle flows like I'm Rosie, Grier, yeah 
Forgot. To tell you, the response is choice 
Comin to smother the brother with the monster voice, 
It's gon na -- wipe slow specimen. I got the hype. 
So, listen in lyrical, nitro-glycerin 
We pack, a punch like a earthquake set 
Comin through your { fuckin } tapedeck is how we shake { shit, } 
So, all you { bitch-ass, } brothers, take shelter, 
Or you'll, be on my conveyor belt. When I melt ya 
It's like that one two for J-5 
Let me tell you that we make it live gray-la-hey 
Breathin in and out lung style, huh 
Mr., Canibus won'tcha, funk it up for a while
