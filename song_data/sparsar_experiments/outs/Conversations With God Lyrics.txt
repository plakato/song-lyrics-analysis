Conversations With God Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


I can see my breath rise in the cold.
Seventeen years old.
Trying to keep my hands warm.
About a dollar in my coat.
Practicing some notes.
To Brandy in my headphones streamin'.
Stole a candy bar so I won't starve.
My mother ain't healthy.
Can't get no job.
Music is the only thing that I got.

Everything around me is broken.
Kinda like home.
Frozen like my earlobes.
And everybody that I know.
Tell me not go.
They don't know I know.
I'll be there.

You see I gotta keep it moving.
Though things get hard.
Cause people around here.
They don't make it too far.
And every time I have a conversation with God.
He always tells me.

Tynisha, I got you.
Got you forever.
And life ain't always gonna be this way.
Whenever you're fallen.
I'm gonna catch you.
Said you'll never ever go away.
It's gonna get crazy.
Before it gets better.
And you will take all the pain away.
Don't you give up now.

My neighborhood's only goal is.
From the bottom of my soul.
Believe me.
Yeah, I know.
That I'm gonna be so much more yeah.
See all I wanna do is make my lost love ones proud.
Look at your little girl now.
Everything's gonna change.
When I come back around.
You will see.

Throw my backs against the ropes.
I ain't given up on hope.
Can't go any lower.
I ain't got nowhere else to go.
Leave it to the Lord to help me.
