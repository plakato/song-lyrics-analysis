Fell in Love with New York Lyrics
by The Zolas.


You're always surrounded.
You're always alone.
I fell in love with New York cause I wanna atone.
I'm talking to strangers now.
And I balance over the rails.
I fell in love with New York where a boy is for sale.

The city hangs like a chandelier.
Gonna swing it if it kills me.
Get a slick chattel internship.
At a gallery in Chelsea.
Yeah the rent's extortionate.
All the give and no get.

Wino oracles, top models, the lump in your throat.

Because.

Gimme that place where I can find my tribe.
Grey city covered in my colours.
Gimme that place where I can crystallize.
It's alright to be an other.
