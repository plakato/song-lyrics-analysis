Road Warriors Lyrics
by Wonder Bred.


You sent them out this morning to find a vehicle.
A rig big enough to haul that fat tank of gas.
What a puny plan!
Look around you.
This is the Valley of Death.

See!
Nothing can escape!
The Humungus rules the Wasteland!

Give them nothing! Blow it up!

Humungus will not be defied!
Wez! Wez!

This is for those sleeping out in the cold.
This is for those with no food, no fridge, and no stove.
Keep your head high its a great day to be alive.
Today seems to also be a good day to die.
I speak in rhyme this is to keep you high.
On your roller coaster.
Even if you can go no lower.
please don't lower.
Your head since its not over until its over.
This is for those who are vocal soldiers.
My road warrior loners, and the misnomered hopeful stoners.
Hoping and knowing there's no road end.
Yet keep going and growing, floating and rowing.
As a wave in the ocean, with eyes wide open.

This is for all of those awake with a vision.
All my Road Warriors, fighting the system.

When people reach out to keep you down, stand up straight.
I make my income with my hands in a hands on way.
When it comes to income I hand my middle finger to the state.
My freedoms are taxes already since they take them away.
I'm embracing the gays and donating to libertarian campaigns.
Even if its only a handful of change, i can pull my weight.
Because i can't wait for the day the world is a United Place.
Support to those who play on a street corner stage.
Dreaming of people screaming their names.
Music making all day for no props no praise.
No audience for real hip hop and no hip hip hoorays.
For whatever i can say, just please take my change.
Keep doing your thing, continue to play when they say you're insane.

This is for those sharing their souls just because.
All my road warriors who do it for nothing but love.
