Independence Lyrics
by Sworn In.

The frozen veil encases the thunderous night.
The wolves are just in reach calling for the moon.

The flame is extinguished.

But don't lose hope, don't lose sight.
Cause its just a little bit farther.
Look up to the stars through the falling snow.

We can't let go.
Reach up, reach up, no we can't let go.

Reach up, the night is nothing to be feared.
The arctic winds flow straight through the core.

Straight through the core.
Smothering the hope we thought we had, that we thought would always last.
The endless horizons, the tundra is too much to handle.
Catacombs of fear, suppressed by the luminosity of the never-ending flames.
The polar routines we once had, separated from the light.
If you think this will break me, you better stop dead in your tracks.

Frozen time can't collapse.
Things change and I accept that, but survival is something I know all too well.
Independence has been taken from you, never living the same lives we once knew.
Reach up, the night is nothing to be feared.

The arctic winds flow straight through the core.
Take back every thing you've said, you're not who you used to be.
Reach up, the night is nothing to be feared.
The arctic winds flow straight through the core.
