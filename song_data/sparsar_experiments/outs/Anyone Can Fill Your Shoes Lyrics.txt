Anyone Can Fill Your Shoes Lyrics
by X.

Some walk tall and some walk fast.
They all act kind but that kinda don't last.
Well, some men are tough and some men are true.
Some men have souls, they ain't.
Like you.

Well some talk loud and play a loud guitar.
Some talk like they're drunken sailors.
Cause they're rude and they're crude and they have tattoos.
And this is a town they won't be coming.
Back to.

When I see one coming.
Well, I know what to do.
Cause anyone.
Yeah, anyone.
Can fill.
Your shoes.

Well, some walk tall and some walk fast.
They all act kind but that kinda don't last.
Well, some men are tough and some men are true.
Some men have souls, they ain't.
Like you.

When I see one coming.
Well, I know what to do.
Cause anyone.
Yeah, anyone.
Anyone.
Can fill.
Your shoes.

When I see one coming.
Well, I know what to do.
Cause anyone.
Yeah, anyone.
All right, anyone.
Can fill.
Your shoes.
