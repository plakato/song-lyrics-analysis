Center Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

Saw your bike.
On your front porch.
Saw the light.
Up in your window.
Thought about knocking.
On your door.
But i was concerned.
You had somebody over.
I was concerned.
You were alone.

The night.
I first met you.
We were dancing.
In the living room.
And we kissed.
In front of everyone.
I had waited two years.
To talk to you.
Helped you move.
Into your new house.
Left hand prints in the closet.
Before we moved you out.
Looking up.
At that room now.
Still half hoping that you'll come down.

Because there's such.
Relief in coincidence.

How you always suspected.
With yourself near the center.
As I get older.
I recognize that love.
Is mostly situational.
