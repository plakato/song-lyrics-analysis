13 Months in 6 Minutes Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Not yet 21.

First slow dance just ends.
I was at my best.
We ignored the rest.
My band and your friends.

But as better night became best day.
We left the party while last records played.
What started as dessert back at your house.
Ended on the couch.
Hours in your mouth.
Sunday's on our hands.
We followed were it led.
I followed you to bed.
We started secret plans.

Forward 7 months.
Only seen you once.
I never call on time.
Trying to seem tough.
One visit's enough.
Enough to keep you mine.
Of course it wasn't.
We were done by June.
You'd graduate and leave for London soon.
Your layover at Newark's near my house.
Met for dinner there.
Just one hour to spare.
Your 20s all mapped out.
I'm in my driest drought.
Feeling old and shot and how.
And this is what I thought.
I seem to still be caught.
I'm a footnote at best.
I envy who comes next.
Wish we could just make out.

'The hour's almost up'.
You said into your cup.
And it makes no difference now.
As I help lift your bags out.
I'm lost and out of rope.
While on my wrist you wrote.
Your newest number down.
I kind of said your name.
But you'd turn to your plane.
So I backed my car out.

I knew we'd never write.
Somehow it seemed all right.
This counts as calling three years out.
