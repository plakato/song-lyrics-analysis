Silhouettes Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

I know you won't admit this.
I am just a silhouette to you.
You found comfort with my distance.
But you never let me stray out of your view.

Who really needs the past.
With the allure of something new.
So we split apart at last.
Went back to places that I knew.
Before you.

And you never have to see.
The light that wraps itself around me.
And I never have to know.
The faces there.
The places you go.

When I can't bear the resistance.
I bend in shapes and ways I never knew.
So I'll try to postpone my existence.
Yeah I'll stop or start my heart if you ask me to.
I'll stop my heart and then I'll wait for you.

I was sure I never would be sure we were in love.

I am sure I never would be sure of love to come.

After you.

And you never have to see.
The light that wraps itself around me.
And I never have to know.
The faces there.
The places you go.
