Pocket Full of Posies Lyrics
by Sworn In.


So take me in, make me feel like i'm drowning.
Drowning in your skin, darkness from within.
You push and you pull, until you feel full.

The light's turned out, and you feel so cold.
So you bring me close, like the night to a crow.
Tell me to breath in, while you start real slow.

La la la la la la la la la  2x.

I'm lost inside you, let me stay in your head.
Let me drink all the blood you've bled.
Got me feeling sweet, my little treat.
Looks like I'm stuck in the fucking sheets.

Behind to where we both fell off.
Consumed by the words muttered through a cough.
No love left here.
This is just fucking pleasure my dear.

La la la la la la la la la  2x.

So you can suck out my life, fuck out of spite.
Take me to bed to make yourself feel alright.
Fill my head with bad dreams, don't know what it means.
The water's hit my lungs it's dripping through the seams.

Take me into my own bad dream please.
Take me, fuck me, make me feel nothing.
Because when I'm with you.

I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I know, I know, I know.
I know that.
I don't, I don't, I don't know what to do.
