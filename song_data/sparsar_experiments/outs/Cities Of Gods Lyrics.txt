Cities Of Gods Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


The clouds part revealing the moon.
Bright like a lamp on a ceiling of gloom.
Underneath we conceal and consume.
Dealers of doom stealing our souls.
Doctors ain't healing no wounds.
And so tax dollars provide dealers with zoom lenses.
The pops ? children like helium balloons.
Eye for an eye means watching your back, neck, and side.
Expecting your death in high beams.
High scream shattered this early morning.
Hush, another mother asking why God scorning us.
Two doors down another son born.
A young couple celebrating while some mourn.

Interlude.

Down the hall.
Down the hall.
Down the hall.
Down the hall.

This city never blinks, not a second to think.
Six billion stories pass while I'm letting the ink flow.
Sink down into the street walking the beat.
Watch the b-boys close, they talk with their feet.
Watch the business class walk with the marketed beast.
Watching Homeland Security, they're targeting me.
Life and death all within reach, carnage and beef.
Hell and Heaven, buying trends, all marketing schemes.
God is alive and well, still the Devil dwells.
In the hearts of men, cycle starts and ends again and again.
Carcinogens in the air we breathe.
I'mma keep three eyes open until they bury me.

Interlude.

A whole city of gods convinced we got the shittiest odds.
Believing our divinity's lost.
So we're sitting here waiting for the saviour.
Surviving with this animal behaviour.
Ready, set, go.

A million cities of gods, convinced we need the pity of God.
Complaining our divinity's lost.
While we're running around living out a dream.
By any means, get it, sell it, ready, set, go.

If your soul love the sun money rock on.
If your soul love the sun honey rock on.
Rock on and rock on and rock on and rock on and.

If your soul love the sun money rock on.
If your soul love the sun honey rock on.
Rock on and rock on and rock on and rock on and.
