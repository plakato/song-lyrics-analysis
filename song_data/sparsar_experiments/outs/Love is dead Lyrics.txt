Love is dead Lyrics
by Ruth Lorenzo.

Warm is ice.
On top of a hillside.
Looking in your eyes.
This is our last goodbye.
You and I.
Buried deep in me.
Iґm digging the one kiss.
When red roses bloomed for us.

Love is dead.
Numb like a beat less drum.
No one else can give it life.
Mourn till dawn.
But forever Iґll sing this song.
Now that love is gone.
Is gone quiet down.

So no one can hear me.
Iґm drowning the feeling.
Silently swallow down.
All the tears.
Now that itґs over.
My breath has gone colder.
Only your name I hear.

Love is dead.
Numb like a beat less drum.
No one else can give it life.
Mourn till dawn.
But forever Iґll sing this song.
Now that love is gone.
Is gone quiet down.

Now Iґll say my vows.
My final words.
Wishing you fortune wherever you go.
Iґll never forget our glorious days.
When we were the sound of love.

Love is dead.
Love is dead.
Now that love.

Love is dead.
Mourn till dawn.
But forever Iґll sing this song.
Now that love is gone.
Is gone....
