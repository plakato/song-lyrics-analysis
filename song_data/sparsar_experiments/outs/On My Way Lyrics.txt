On My Way Lyrics
by Voice.

It's late in the night.
As I look through this window.
And the smell of rain fills the sky.
Seems that the time stands still.
And just for a moment.
The world turns around me.

Now it's still time to let go.
All the things I have known.
Set myself free.
To come to a higher plain.

I feel I can fly.
That's not the end.
I leave all doubts behind.
I'm on my way.
To a new time.
All my fears fade awy.
I see a wide, open sky.

It's getting darker and darker.
I've got just one more question.
Will I get higher or is it almost the same.
At the darkest point.
I still hope for redemption.
As that blinding light came.

Now I know I'm gone.
There is so much to learn, much to learn.
And again I'm free.
Will come to a higher plain.

I feel I can fly.
That's not the end.
I leave all doubts behind.
I'm on my way.
To a new time.
All my fears fade away.
I see a wide, open sky.

I feel I can fly.
That's not the end.
I leave all doubts behind.
I'm on my way.
To a new time.
All my fears fade away.

I feel I can fly.
That's not the end.
I leave all doubts behind.
I'm on my way.
To a new time.
All my fears fade away.
I see a wide, open sky.
