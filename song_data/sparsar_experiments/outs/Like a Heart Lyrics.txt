Like a Heart Lyrics
by Voice.

Where have the ancient times gone.
In which our lives were still so easy to control.
We didn't know any tear and got satisfaction.
We were invincible and united for reaction.

We were like a heart.
We were fearless and wild.
We were like a heart and a soul.
Merged and united.
United forever.

We thought to be like a big clan.
But the time led us into the light of the truth.
Our ways parted slowly.
And the faith in the freedom broke.
Remaining only the memory.
Of a rough wild youth.

We were like a heart.
We were fearless and wild.
We were like a heart and a soul.
Merged and united.
United forever.

Sometimes I sit here.
With my memories in the silence alone.
Fell the old rhythm in my blood.
Then I break thee.
From my quiet sweet home.

We were like a heart.
We were fearless and wild.
We were like a heart and a soul.
Merged and united.
United forever.

We were like a heart.
We were fearless and wild.
We were like a heart and a soul.
Merged and united.
United forever.
