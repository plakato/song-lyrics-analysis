Complex Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.

Yeah x7.

One word to describe me, that shit is complex.
I stepped into the game real muhfuckin complex.
Real life shit a young nigga gotta deal with.
I ain't feeding into no muhfuckin nonsense.
Shaq size skeletons in my fucking closet.
Really gotta live with that shit up on my conscious.
One word to describe me, that shit is complex.
Middle finger to that hating nigga at the Complex.
Yeah, oh you feel a way, I know you feel a way.
Yeah, i'm just doing me, I know you still gon hate, yeah.
Oh you still gon hate, I know you still gon hate, yeah.
I stay in my lane and y'all stay in my way, yeah.
I been everywhere and you been MIA, yeah.
I be lowkey, don't need cameras in my face, yeah.
I'm just trying to get some Grammy's in my mama place.
Why I gotta do this shit, I can't explain.
Shit is, shit is complex.
Yeah, real muhfuckin complex.
I'm not the same, I done changed, i'm evolving.
Just give me time, it's a muhfuckin process.
Yeah, i'm still trying to figure out, let me figure out.
Been grinding for a minute now, trying to figure out.
My daughter getting bigger now and I been missing out, yeah.
Feel like I been missing out, yeah.

Hey, where's Madison?
Hey Madison.
Maddy!
Hey daddy!
Hey baby! What you doing?
A lot.
You miss papi? I love you!
All right.
I love you.
Daddy!
Just say it back. All right, all right cool.
Papi, papi, papi, papi, papi.
All right, bye.
Thank you Christian, that's all I needed.
