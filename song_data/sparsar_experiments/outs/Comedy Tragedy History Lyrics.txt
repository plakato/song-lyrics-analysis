Comedy Tragedy History Lyrics
by Akala.


Dat boy Akala's a diamond fella.
All you little boys are a Comedy of Errors.
You bellow but you fellows get played like.
The cello, I'm doing my.
ting.
You're jealous like Othello.
Who you? what you gonna do?
All you little boys get Tamed like the Shrew.
You're mid-summer dreamin'.
Your tunes ain't appealing.
I'm Capulet, you're Montague, I ain't feeling.
I am the Julius Caesar hear me.
The Merchant Of Venice couldn't sell your CD.
As for me, All's Well That Ends Well.
Your boy's like Macbeth, you're going to Hell.
Measure for Measure, I am the best here.
You're Merry Wives of Windsor not King Lear.
I don't know about Timon.
I know he was in Athens.
When I come back like Hamlet you pay for your action.

Dat boy Akala, I do it As You Like It.
You're Much Ado About Nothing.
All you do is bite it.
I'm too tight, I don't need 12 Nights.
All you little Tempests get murked on the mic.
Of course I'm the one with the force.
You're history just like Henry IV.
I'm fire, things look dire.
Better run like Pericles Prince Of Tyre.
Off the scale, cold as a Winter's Tale.
Titus Andronicus was bound to fail.
So will you if Akala get at ya.
That's suicide like Anthony &amp; Cleopatra.

Love's Labours Lost, a.
woman on her own.
She needed Two Gentlemen Of Verona.
This is illa State and I am the owner.

Wise is the man that knows he's a fool.
Tempt not a desperate man with a jewel.
Why take from Peter to go pay Paul?
Some rise by sin and by virtue fall.
What have you made if you gain the whole world.
But sell your own soul for the price of a pearl?
The world is my oyster and I am starving.
I want much more than a penny or a farthing.
I told no joke, I hope you're not laughing.
Poet or pauper which do you class him?
Speak eloquent, though I am resident to the gritty inner city.
That's surely irrelevant.
Call it urban, call it street.
A rose by any other name, smell just as sweet.
Spit so hard, but I'm smart as the Bard.
Come through with a Union Jack for the yard.

Akala, Akala, wherefore art thou?
I'm the black Shakespeare and.
The secret's out now.
Chance never did crown me, this is destiny.
You still talk but it still perplexes me.
Devour cowards, thousands per hour.
Don't you know the king's name is a tower?
You should never speak it.
It is not a secret.
I teach thesis, like anicent Greece's.
Or Egyptology, never no.
apology.
In my mind's eye, I see.
things properly.
Stopping me, nah you could never possibly.
I bear a charmed life, most probably.
For certain I put daggers in a phrase.
I'll put an end to your dancing days.
No matter what you say it will never work.
Wrens can't make prey.
Where eagles don't perch.
I'm the worst with the words.
Cos I curse all my verbs.

There's a hearse for the first jerk who turn berserk.
Off with his head, cos it must not work.
Ramp with Akala, that is true madness.
And there's no method in it, just sadness.
I speak with the daggers and the hammers.
Of a passion when I'm rappin I attack 'em.
In a military fashion the pattern of my rappin.
Chattin couldn't ever map it.
And I run more rings round things than Saturn.
Sick, never slackin' like a pig with a baton.

That boy Akala, the black Shakespeare.
Didn't want to listen, when I said last year.
Rich like a gem in a Ethiope's ear.
Tell them again.
For them who never hear.
