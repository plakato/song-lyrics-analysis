Antidote Lyrics
by Swedish House Mafia.

There's no antidote.

Don't stop.
Turn that up.
Take it higher.
Tear this mother up.
Start a riot.

There's a glitch inside my system.
Pushing through my whole existence.
Got me twisted, can't resist this.
Something's flipping all my switches.

Take 'em, break 'em, make 'em feel it.
Mix it up and mass appeal it.
Pressure is riding me hard.
Killer dose right through my heart.

And there's no antidote.
And there's no antidote.
And there's no antidote.

There's no antidote.
There's no antidote.
There's no antidote.
