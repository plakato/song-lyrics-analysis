Keep it to Yourself (feat. Gustaf Spetz) Lyrics
by АК-47.


Aaah, ah-aaah.

Is it time for me to leave?
Has it come to an end?
Were you ever meant to be.
Meant to be for me.

Aaah, ah-aaah.
Could i ever make it work.
Work for us again?
So i say, hey, what's on your mind?
So you say, hey, what's on yours?
I just want you to know.
You can.

Keep your little love.
Keep your little lie.
Cause i'm too tired to go on.

Keep your little love.
Keep your little lie.
Keep it to yourself.
‘cause i'm too tired to go on.

It's time for me to leave.
It has come to an end.
You were never meant to be.
Meant to be for me.
So you say, hey, what's on your mind?
But i say, hey, what's on yours?
I just want you to know.
You can.

Keep your little love.
Keep your little lie.
Keep it to yourself.
‘cause i'm too tired to go on.

Keep your little love.
Keep your little lie.
Keep it to yourself.
Cause i'm so tired.

Keep your little love.
Keep your little lie.
Keep it to yourself.
Cause i'm too tired to go.

Keep your little love.
Keep your little lie.
Keep it to yourself.
Cause i'm too tired to go.
