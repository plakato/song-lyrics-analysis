All The Same Lyrics
by Voli.

You people are all the same.
So quiet until my voice finds its range.
And so.
You sculpt my thoughts with your blades.
Till you drain my heart with every word you say.
You people are all the same.

Say, do you love me? Do you love me?
Say, do you love me? Do you love me?
You people are all the same.
You people are all the same.

When we was children we say, anything is possible, then we grow up.
And now everything is an obstacle as we older, oh god.
What goin on? Don't believe what they say.
Self doubt is the prequel to pain.
Guess it's a problem when you ain't living like others.
The day you break the mold, they looking at you like fungus.
Do they love me? Do they love me? But all they can do is judge me.
Ain't it funny how success is so often confused with money?
Ey, why they chastise the girl for being book smart.
And terrorize the boy that rather play dolls than football.
We celebrate normal and demonize different.
We lead by division, deceived by religion.
My god, life's song can't keep track, no ipod.
Make money, make sure you land the right job.
Marry, but make sure it ain't no white girl, I need reprisal oooh.
