I Hate You But I Love You Lyrics
by Russian Red.

You were so high above in the sky.
I just keep feeling like a little child.

I hate you but I love you.
I just can't take how beautiful you are.
I hate to say this but my eyes go blind.

I hate you but I love you.
My favourite song becomes a healing sign.
I hate to say this cause my heart goes blind.

Oh you were so high above in the sky.
Everytime I travel far I think about you by my side.
To any of those places I cannot go back.

I hate you but I love you.
I just can't take how beautiful you are.
I hate to say this but my eyes go blind.

I hate you but I love you.
My favourite song becomes a healing sign.
I hate to say this cause my heart goes blind.
