The House That Swallows Everything Lyrics
by XP.

*Two Guys Talking*.

Hey now!

It's doomsday.

The end of the world, Help me!

You want me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction.

And because without you I'd die.

Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.

My name is!

If the walls could speak.
They would be.
They would tell the story of a boy.
Who's constantly seen shit.
Who's been fighting his demons.
In the form of his family.
Constantly plotting and trying to deceive him.
His mom would tell him to leave although he was barely 17.
She could  without the second of a thought.
She'd insult him and in his room's where he would rot.
It was painfully obvious that this home ain't for the heart.
a room over she's fighting for her life.
To keep her independence she's just trying to survive.
Mom would care more for the song though it was mention.
So between the son and her there would obviously be tension.
Over time they would come to hate each other and.
Fight like cats and dogs opposed to sister and brother.
And don't even mention the father cause.

It's a broken home that makes this XP a demon.
If seeing is believing, You the best? Then I wouldn't be seeing.
Sharks that be fiending for some meat.
Then I'm jumping right in parting the sea.
Redman then my sight must be clear.
Judas betrayed Christ then I must've been him.
Pardon my sins dear lord, man I heard you forgive.
Honestly I can't believe my father left me at 5.
Staying alive wasn't primal I was just trying to survive.
Fighting the lies in my life staring up to the sky.
The Aaron that they once knew man has already died, I.

Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
Please Don't you Leave me lonely.
