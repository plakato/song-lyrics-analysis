Don't Worry (My Shorty) Lyrics
by Rufus Blaq.

Rufus Blaq.
Dont worry.
2x.

Yo Yo Yo U da bomb in ya lace wit da hot body.
Work it out uh dont stop mommy.
Drop on me.
Can't afford to lose u.
And watch all deze small time cats choose u.
In tha third eye dey could abuse u.
Hear u on da park bench sayin boohoo.
All dese player hatas wanna do is do u.
Spend a little doe and brew u booze to.
It ain't cristyle he bringin u bru bru.
Showin u love shit dat few do.

Spindarella.
Oh is that so.
Den who wuz dat hoe.
That u wuz kissin on, trickin on, sippin mo.
Hands in her pants on tha dance flo.
Slow jam style to an uptempo.
Ima put it down plain and simple.
Funny style cats get lost to my flow.

Dont Worry.
My shorty.
Dont u like tha way I dish out tha cash yeah yeah.
Can't u understand dat I missed dat ass uh huh.
Dont Worry.
My Shorty.
Baby I know u wanna make it last.
Im da one datta take care of dat ass.

Spinderella.
Baby its real in my field and tha grass is green.
You ain't got game u jus lie and scheme.

Rufus Blaq.
You wuznt talkin all dat when I wuz freakin u out.
Eatin u out.
But u taste sweet in my mouth.

Spinderella.
That ain't what its about.
Cuz love and respect.
You can keep ya 6 figure checks and ya lex.

Rufus Blaq.
I remember when u wuz spendin dem.
Whippin in my lex whitcha friends and dem.
Ha ha.

spinderella.
I remember when a balla in tha makin.
When I took u from Okies ta Tims.

Rufus Blaq.
Den I took myself from Tims ta Gators.
Im tha owner of tha team no longer a player.

Rufus Blaq.
Keep ya mind on ya money and ya heart on keeping it.
Luvs gon be der never try seeking it.
If u ain't ballin dont try speaking it.
U got a good girl u shouldn't be out freaking shit.
Im tha cure for tha common cat.
Never been a typical and I woke let a nickel go.
I love my shorty in all honesty.
But I can't stop her if she gon leave me.
I make mistakes straight up who dont.
I fell for an ass in tha face who won't.
I messed up damn now my girl wanna jet.
Gimme tha chance to progress.
Now tell me.
How many cats u know that got doe.
And ain't gettin sweated fo tha cash flow.
Its hard out there dont doubt me.
We get down now shorty Stick it out wit me.

Tha things u do.......
Tha things u do......
