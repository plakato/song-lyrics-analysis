Stick Up Kids Lyrics
by Wu Block.


Keep, taking about that money, 
Ima stick'em, 
Ha, ha ha ha, stick'em 
Send, a bitch home wit, him 
Let. Her tell us where to get him 
Got the hollows in that ruger 
Im. Looking at your chains, 
Cause them diamond. Look clearer, 
Than that water in Aruba, 
You ain't even got ta jack'em 
You, barely need a gun. 
You can walk up and smack'em 
They, so soft 
Then you got. The rats 
That fact should be up north 
Donnie on his bullshit 
Mask and a full clip 
Hoppin' out. The whip, 
I'mma stick'em, 
Ha ha ha stick'em, 
Lay him down on the floor. 
My mans at the door, 
My other homie downstairs 
Hand on the 4 
I ain't even got ta koll em 
I'm. Just coming for that raw 
 
My daughter, said stick'em 
Mama said: stick'em 
My son said daddy. If he move 
I'mma lick'em 
My grandmother go to church, 
To, pray on my victims. She say: 
Burr, stick'em, ha ha ha, stick'em, 
 
Ya, know I'mma, slim nigga, 
From, a large family 
The burner get passed, 
Around the crew like a grammy 
My little man with autusim 
He, looked at me. 
And, looked at duke and said: stick'em 
Why ya. Looking at me, stick'em 
I hope you remove the body 
But where we gon na ship'em 
Fuck it. I just draw a door to me: duck 
Cut the jewels 
He said ship me, I'm not giving it up. 
Word, Awe shit, 
Its gon na be a long day. 
Her maid just got enough 
Maps for this hallway 
Home still smelling like ajax 
Ripped, the Jules off his neck, 
Like, chill par, relax 
Understand, it came through 
C alar ripped him 
Doc had to staple his face, 
Straight victim 
This. How we do it in Staten 
We. Hardly get caught with our hoodies off 
Let alone, a ratchet 
, 
My daughter, said stick'em 
Mama said stick'em 
My son said daddy. If he move 
I'mma lick'em 
My grandmother go to church 
To pray on my victims. She say: 
Burr, stick'em, ha, ha ha stick'em, 
 
Get my hand on the hawk I'mma stick'em 
Aids needle I'mma stick'em 
Got, the red nose off the leash 
Can't wait to sic'em 
Usually make'em. Take it off 
Slow when I strip'em 
Prolly better to kill'em 
Cause. He can't take the whipping 
Consider it charity 
Vvs clarity, 
ARA is the armed robbers academy, 
Put it in the bag, 
I, don't care its waever homes, 
Big shit, all the way 
Down to the heron bones: 
Credit cards debit cards, 
Everybody get god. 
Wedding bands birthstones 
Camouflage earth tones 
Yea, my cloth is cut different 
It, don't cost nothing 
To, just listen 
But, if not I'mma, burrr, stick'em, 
Ha ha ha stick'em, 
, 
My daughter, said stick'em 
Mama said stick'em 
My son said daddy. If he move 
I'mma lick'em 
My grandmother go to church 
To pray on my victims. She say: 
Burr, stick'em, ha ha ha stick'em.
