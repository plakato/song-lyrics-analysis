The Bliss Lyrics
by Volbeat.


Memory, your lamp light is burning holes.
Recover the damage, bring it all home.
Follow the bliss just like Summer song.
Please stay there forever, I'll try to remember.
Come home.

Memory, you gave me another note.
A voice that is endless, bring it all home.
Oh what it is feels like a Summer song.
I'll stay here forever, her face I remember.

Presenting a new beginning.
Forever you and I.
And when the morning gets lonely.
And life is out of sight.
Then we'll be leaving together, you and I.

Happiness, I'm sorry you've been on hold.
The doors will be open, bring it all home.
Cause what it is, feels like a Summer song.
I'll stay here forever now that I remember.

Presenting a new beginning.
Forever you and I.
And when the morning gets lonely.
And life is out of sight.
Then we'll be leaving together, you and I.

Woah, woah, woah-oh-oh.
For all these symbols don't open our eyes.
We'll close them instead, leave the messenger behind.
But one day we will know....

Presenting a new beginning.
Forever you and I.
And when the morning gets lonely.
And life is out of sight.
Then we'll be leaving, then we'll be leaving....
Presenting a new beginning.
Forever you and I.
And when the morning gets lonely.
And life is out of sight.
Then we'll be leaving together, you and I.

Then we'll be leaving together, you and I.
Then we'll be leaving together, you and I.
