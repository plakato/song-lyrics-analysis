Don't Take It Personal Lyrics
by Yungen.

Sample of Jhen√© Aiko's - The Worst.
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you.
But I want you.
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.
But I love you.
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you.
But I want you.
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.
But I love you.

They just see the final edit, they don't ever know behind the scenes.
CJ's living a nightmare, Yungen's living the dream.
Wore a fake smile for years, now it's starting to wear off, shit they ain't.
got a clue where I been.
They say I'm paranoid, well you try being kidnapped as a kid.
A gun put to your head and taken from where you live.
I saw psychiatrists for months, them people mess up how you think.
I swear to God I ain't been the same since.
Too young to understand, but old enough to be scared.
My dad took me to Jamaica until everything cleared.
Come back to a new house, new school - now everything's so weird.
Thinking back it still leaves me in tears.
Fast forward some years.
My mum fucked off to Jamaica.
Left me home alone at 13, that shit made me hate her.
Probably 'cos I used to love her so much.
She was gone 3 months and barely kept in touch.
Going through hell, thinking life ain't fair.
I felt like my older sister was the only one there.
No electric, no gas here but who can I tell.
'cos if I do I'll probably end up in care.
But while you was out robbing man for fun, I was robbing 'cos I had to.
Everybody called me a bad yout'.
That tore me up because they didn't have a clue.
They judged me, I just wished they knew.

Don't take this personal.
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you.
But I want you.
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.
But I love you.
Don't take this personal.
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you.
But I want you.
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.
But I love you.

I ain't been school in weeks.
I was out on the streets.
There weren't one single lesson teaching me how to eat.
Has your house ever been so cold you can't sleep?
I was in the ends trying to make ends meet.
Yeah, my mum come back but she was gone again before I knew it.
It's sad, I just got used to it.
But when she came back for good she kicked me out, yeah I've been through it.
Only the Lord knows how I didn't lose it.
They tried to put me in a hostel in a ends that I've got beef in.
It's so peak that I ain't sleeping.
I just wanna go home but it's real here and I ain't leavin'.
Trying to speak to God, all I got was a ceiling.
Hoping my dad would come and save me but he ain't tried.
Plus one of my closest friends just died.
I felt like my whole world was crumblin' before my eyes.
There were times I didn't wanna be alive.
But take all of this away I wouldn't be who I am.
Even though it wasn't part of the plan.
Real shit, that turned me from a boy to a man.
I'm tryna sort everything that I can.
Tryna rebuild with my mum, hoping she's gonna change.
Even though they say that she's to blame.
But for once in my life, I don't need her but I want her, I still love her, I.
hope she feels the same.

Don't take this personal.
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you.
But I want you.
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.
But I love you.
Don't take this personal.
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you.
But I want you.
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.
But I love you.
Don't take this personal.
