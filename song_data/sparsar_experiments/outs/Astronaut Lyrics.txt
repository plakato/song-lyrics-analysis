Astronaut Lyrics
by Quasimoto.


but we've been out there in orbit.
And walked further than the moon ain't we?

Ten to one if you found a dude.
Straighten you as good as me.
Wouldn't be no more angel than me anyway.

Interlude.
Ain't gon' pull no train on you.
No freight train anyway.
Maybe one or two after the surprisee.
He's first cause it's his party.
First as far as they'll know anyway.
Anyhow it look like rain tonight anyway.

Come on.
Come on.

Look out for a Double D.
She lying I'm tellin' ya, who you gonna believe her or me?

You ain't no astronaut but we've been out there in orbit.
And walked further than the moon ain't we?
Who wants to be full of regrets when old father time taps.
Life don't give no green stamps.

That could straighten you as good as me.
Wouldn't be no more angel than me anyway.
Yeah we've been out there in orbit.
And walked further than the Moon ain't we? Ain't We?
Just between you and me, you and me, you and me.
You and me, you and me, you....
