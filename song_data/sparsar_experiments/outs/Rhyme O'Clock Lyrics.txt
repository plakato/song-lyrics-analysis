Rhyme O'Clock Lyrics
by Wordburglar.

More Or Les and Wordburglar 
It's, More Or Les and Wordburg up in the spot, 
With the speakers turned on and the mics are hot 
We got people in the place who came to rock 
 Yo Burg 
What's the time on your watch, 
Rhyme o'clock, 
We. All up in the spot, 
With the speakers turned on and the mics are hot 
We got people in the place who came to rock 
 
What's the time on your watch. 
 
Rhyme o'clock, 
We meld minds like Spock 
Bubbling, like Corona, when a lime is dropped. 
In. The wild making noise like when pines get chopped 
Moving heads like ladies who's behinds, are hot 
Designed to rock 
Co-sign, with props 
In, an affidavit state, and we define the spots 
So. Why not 
Bring on the next hype, bringer 
We take him out the ring, like your ex-wife's finger, 
, 
More Or Les 
Pick your pain in the ass. I'M having bed bugs 
I'm itching to get in the track. So can't forget some 
Lukewarm radio 
Pet, that's taking your 
Cat for a thinking 
As. I fly the the steps in 
Shallow 
Proceed with showtime at the Gallow 
To Gallow 
We, roast like pig on park battle. 
Metallo 
Can't keep your comics'round me 
True reader for real 
Ask, Wordburgy, 
, 
, More Or Les and Wordburglar 
, 
, More Or Les 
Rhyme o'clock. 
Greenwich mean top-noch digital 
When, you kids, talk, sweet, slop, songs, pitiful 
Gag me with spoon 
Barf, not minimal 
Plaque. It sticks to all your syllables 
Staying simple for the safest civilian Syllabubs 
For, the simian serious 
Motherfuck 
That. I rhyme 
Keep it pumping like a big bilge in this building 
With the Burg in the business you bridesmaids, aren't brides 
We're lyric to the flow 
 
Wordburglar 
Halifax to Orlando 
Run, the Millennium like Han or Lando 
 
Yeah. You know it's fam 
And, I'm down with Sharon/sharing like Lois and Bram 
God, damn 
Spread new dope rhymes 
All over the streets like ED-209 

And eat all the food. In your grand fridge, 
 
Rhyme o'clock 
Are, you hurting stressed 
Cause Burg and Les 
Will, make you burden-less 
, 
More Or Les 
For sure, with Fresh Kils 
It's likely not broken 
Beat Hammer Time 
Like the son of Odin 
 
Wordburglar, 
The, super-villains, 
Forget, Loki and Red Skull. 
We'Ll leave you more blue 
Than, a depressed Brett Hull, 
 
More Or Les 

Tia Eagle 
See no evil 
Peanuts 
Like, bald people feeding, beagles 
, 
Wordburglar 
Yo. We needn't needles, 
To get DJ's to scratch. This 
 
More Or Les 
Never sell out 
 
Wordburglar 
But. We always on the backlist, 
 
More Or Les 
 Got ta re-up 
 
Wordburglar 
Before. We get torrented, 
, 
More Or Les 
Haters gon na hate, 
 
Wordburglar 
But. It'S really unwarranted, 
, 
More Or Les 
Yo. You want some more of this 
 
Wordburglar and More Or Les 
Good 
We knew. There was a reason we came up to your hood, 
 
More Or Les 
To rock it non-stop 
, 
Wordburglar, 
Keep it hot on stage, 
, 
Wordburglar and More Or Les 
And. We doing big time 
Like the clock on Flav
