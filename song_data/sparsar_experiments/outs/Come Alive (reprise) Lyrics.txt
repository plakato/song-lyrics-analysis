\--------------------------------.
As a story of my life zooms out from my mind.
I've come to realize that.
We're just but a million kinds.
A piece of dust - Lost souls in the wind.
Do our lifetimes end before they begin?

I'm so happy - I'm so gay.
All is well that ends well....

Come alive, She said to me.
I'm alive, you wanna be.
Come alive, She said to me.
...I'm alive alone ...I'm alive alone.

Wake up, wake up....
Wake up, wake up... Burn, mother, burn, burn.

A toe tag ends the tale of a life insignificant.
Or so they say in the news today.
Smiling faces, live for the moment.
But before you know it.
They'll be reading off the tag on your toe.

Wake up, wake up - Wake up and live.
Wake up &amp; breathe, &amp; burn, mother, burn, burn.
....

...I'm alive alone,.
...I'm alive alone.
