Take Me Away Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.

I got up and out of bed crying take it away.
Stress messing' wit' my head, God take it away.
A black man so the Fed's want to take me away.
Conspiracy.
Whatever's said get ya taken away.
Man why they hate us having bread.
Wanna take it away.
Don't want to share it with us, scared we gon' take it away.
Get a little, get ahead then they take it away.
The ghetto hanging by a thread, but we making a way.
Come on Tena.

Haters would try to take it away.
Don't wanna see us living good.
Wanna take it away.
Get my momma out the hood for it take her away.
Chop game like it's wood, cause' it's paper to make.
Pray to God.
So I'm ready if he take me away.
With Ahmad.
Men steady trying to take me away.
Living is hard getting heavy on me take it away.
Ain't a game to me ya'll so I'm shaking the fake.

Up, up, up and away.
Baby take me.
Away from here.
Run off together.
Up, up and away.
Baby take me.
Away from here.
Won't come back ever.

Dear Lord take me away they plotting trying to get me.
Take me away they lying they ain't with me God.
Take me away I'm in a twist dizzy.
Take me away, take me away.
Take me away you put me here to do it God.
Take me away you gotta see me through it God.
Take me away I don't know what I'm doing God.
Take me away, take me away.

Ran out of places I can run.
God take me away.
At night praying till the Son come take me away.
Work while they have fun cause I'm breaking away.
And I ain't quitting till I'm done can't take it away.
We broke you doing fine eating gravy and steak.
I'm moving up and getting mine finna make me a plate.
I only got one life to live so I'm taking it day by day.
Till it's taken away.

I been killin' mix tapes way before I heard 50.
Hollywood cat's fake, streets stayed with me.
Say you want test mod.
What come get me.
I don't hesitate rhyme.
Buss mine quickly.
We in pain, in chains, insane, explains life in the black ghetto.
You don't wanna live what I live, give what I give, road that I'm on many.
souls won't go.
And I ain't got a bankroll as big as some but I'm straight though.
Food on my plate yo.
Gotta be thankful.
Blessed with a great flow.
Soon as the Jones clique blow we gon' ball like the Late' Show.
You love this when you press play.
Bump what the press say.
Fools know Ahmad be bussin'.
I'm west coast and they hate that.
Young and I'm straight black.
Y'all never gave me nothing!
I'ma take it away.

God please take me away I'm running for my life now.
Take me away they jealous of my lifestyle.
Take me away need you to do it right now.
Take me away, take me away.
Take me away you put me here to do it God.
Take me away you gotta see me through it God.
Take me away I don't know what I'm doing God.
Take me away, take me away.

Tena adlib.
Ohh gotta go.
Please take me away from here.
I don't wanna pack no bags I'm leaving on the next train out.
Take me away.
