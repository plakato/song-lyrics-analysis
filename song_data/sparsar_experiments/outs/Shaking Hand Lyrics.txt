Shaking Hand Lyrics
by Women.

I saw it.
Hit the ground.
But no one.
Was around.
Can you even tell me that no one is the same as you.
Same as you.
Nature walking racket wall of guns sent straight out.
As you.
As you.
There were ticking bloody watches in our hands.
Important to the soil to make ladders.
Have another heart attack before the marked chairs.
Open up your mouth where you want to go.
I can hardly recognize the shapes.
The shapes.
Wandering through Chinatown once times every artificial need.
Artificial need.
Slip down open over such smallity.
Alright.
