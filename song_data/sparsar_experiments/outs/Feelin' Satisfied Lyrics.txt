Feelin' Satisfied Lyrics
by Boston.


Well come on.
All you people.
The time has come to get together.
You gotta have a little rock 'n' roll music.
To get you through the stormy weather.
And do whatever you feel.
When you let go.
Nothing's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll.

So come on, put you hands together.
You know it's now or never.
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll.

Ooo are you feeling satisfied.
Come on let us give your mind a ride.
Ooo are you ready tonight.
Come on let us give your mind a ride You can do what you like.
Come on let us give your mind a ride.

Oh that funky feeling.
Is what you need to get you through.
You oughta know.
I'll tell you something.
Don't let your troubles get to you.
Cause win or lose it's alright.
Well take control.
And nothing's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll.

Ooo are you feeling satisfied.
Come on let us give your mind a ride.
Ooo are you ready tonight.
Come on let us give your mind a ride You can do what you like.
Come on let us give your mind a ride.
