Action Lyrics
by Sweet.

So you think you'll take another piece of me.
To satisfy your intellectual need.

Do you want action?

Gonna bring you down.
Cause you're pushin' me.
You gotta recognize my superiority.

You know you believed it.

Cause I'm the main man.
And that's why.

Everybody wants a piece of the action.
Everybody needs a main attraction.
I got what everybody needs, satisfaction guaranteed.
Everybody wants a piece of the action.

Ooh, I was suicidal cause she was my idol.
Baby, baby, baby, bring it to your knees.
Now, there was a time I would have walked the line.
But you bled me dry.
With your insatiable greed.

You know you believed it.

Cause I'm the main man.
And that's why.

Everybody wants a piece of the action.
Everybody needs a main attraction.
I got what everybody needs, satisfaction guaranteed.
Everybody wants a piece of the action.

Do you want action, action?
Everybody wants, everybody needs.
Everybody wants, everybody needs.

Everybody wants a piece of the action.
Everybody needs a main attraction.
I got what everybody needs, satisfaction guaranteed.
Everybody wants a piece of the action, action, action.
