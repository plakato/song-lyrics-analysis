Desperate Times
by Underoath.

Ive been crawling around.
In the dark for a while.
Sprawled out across the floor.
Not collecting dust anymore.
Define me a parasite, define my host.
Trapped beneath the floor.
I slowly waste away.
Now I pull my frail body into the chair.
And look me in the face.
Oh, disappointments, so disappointing.
This may be my last one.
Its gonna be good and hard.
It might be a touch out of key.
A touch out of key.
When this thing breaks.
I will be you, you will be me.
Im afraid that this is really happening.
When this thing breaks.
I will be you, you will be me.
Lets hope this is short lived.
And riddled with dizzy.
Oh God, the noise is ringing in my ear.
Its so unclear, so unclear.
I hear them talking.
But can't make out the words.
Speak up, speak clear.
I hear them talking.
But can't make out the words.
Speak up, speak clear.
God, where have I been?
Im a terrible company.
With zero apologies.
My God, where have I been?
Where have I been?
While I sink to the bottom.
Ill sing out as it fills with water.
I hope Ive done enough.
When this thing breaks.
I will be you, you will be me.
Lets hope this is short lived.
And riddled with dizzy.
When this thing breaks.
I will be you, you will be me.
Im afraid that this is really happening.
Im worn out.
Im worn thin.
I will never break through.
Im worn out.

Im worn thin.

I will never break through.

Let me out.
Let me out.
Let me out.
