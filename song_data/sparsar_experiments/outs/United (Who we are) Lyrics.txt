United (Who we are) Lyrics
by XO-IQ.


Let's come together.
We'll build it up and make it better.
When walls divide it.
We tear them down become united.

It's symptomatic of automatic love.
This could be our night.
For us to come alive.
It's time to show them who we are.
Who we are.
Who we are.
Who we are.

So fascinating.
Our journey to our destination.
It's so amazing.
On this golden road we're blazin.

It's symptomatic of automatic love.
This could be our night.
For us to come alive.
It's time to show them who we are.
Who we are.
Who we are.
Who we are.

It's so amazing.
On this golden road we're blazin.
It's so amazing.
On this golden road we're blazin.
Who we are.
Who we are.
Who we are.
Who we are.
