A Knife in the Sun Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.


A knife in the sun.
I don't know how it happened.
The white lady....
Cops, transsexuals.
Taxi drivers, homosexuals.
Drug dealers, mariachis, pick pockets.

Knife x8.

Prince of peace.
At least indulge us.
Flesh was once food, now food is flesh.
Your lover will hate you.
Despair and shut up.

Knife x8.

Gold, silver, copper.
Blue, violet, red.
Green.
