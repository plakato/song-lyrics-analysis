Cradle Pyre Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

On a tidal wave I stand.
Perhaps of me you've heard.
With a storm cloud in my hand.
I've come dispensing word.

Of your company I've tired.
Your welcome here is worn.
It is you who lit this cradle pyre.
It is you who woke this storm.

So I do this with regret.
But you've left me little choice.
When your mouth is full of threats.
When you speak you use my voice.

Oh child where will you run.
When the world's on fire?
Old man see what you've done.
As the flames grow higher.
