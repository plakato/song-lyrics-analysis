Kicking My Heels Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Why you keep me around?
When you can have anyone in this town.
Am I the best you hope for?
Just the best that you found.
And there's no way to explain it.
But either way you know I'll take it.

Through the haze of the whisky lights.
And the haze of the angels dressed in cocaine white.
I'm not trying to make you change.
But love, I know what I like.
First you play along, even though it's wrong.
But then it starts feeling right.

And now, more I drink the less I feel sorrow.
More I make the less that I borrow.
More I love ya' the less that I feel alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.

Every person and place that I've been.
I keep seeing the same thing all over again.
See even God needs the devil.
And I'm one hell of a friend.
If it makes you feel much better.
At least we're going down together.

More I drink the less I feel sorrow.
More I make the less that I borrow.
More I love ya' the less that I feel alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.

Yeah, yeah, hey.
Yeah, yeah, hey.
Yeah, yeah, hey.

Don't wanna worry the rest of my life.
Just wanna stay here and have a good time.

Don't wanna worry the rest of my life.

Wanna stay here just have a good time.

More I drink, the less I feel sorrow.
More I make, the less that I borrow.
More I love ya' the less that I feel alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels.

The more I drink, the less I feel sorrow.
More I make, the less that I borrow.
More I love ya', the less that I feel alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.

Stoned, kicking my heels alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.

Come on, now.
