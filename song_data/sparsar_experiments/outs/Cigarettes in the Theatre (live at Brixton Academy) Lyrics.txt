Cigarettes in the Theatre (live at Brixton Academy) Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

It starts in the theatre, a night of encounters.
If I hadn't been there, if not for a cigarette.

And you could see it change.
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light.
Just keep talking now.
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things.

Difference in opinion was never an issue.
Collect all your questions cause this time we've all night.

And you could see it change.
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light.
Oh, just keep taking now.
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things.

And you could see it change.
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light.
Just keep taking now.
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things.
