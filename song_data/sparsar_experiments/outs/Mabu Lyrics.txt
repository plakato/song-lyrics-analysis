Mabu Lyrics
by PUP (band).

I went down to the water
With the help of my father
Out of the lake in mid-June
I pulled my car Mabu
I need an engine that runs

It came down to the wire
Put. The pump to the tire
It gets me. Hi-Igh-Igh-Igh
It makes her go-o-o-o
Now that she's gone so soon
I need a car like Mabu
And, you know, she'll come around
I need an engine that runs

I drive my car through lakes and lagoons. Oh, oh oh
I drive my car, my car Mabu, oh oh oh

And. I know when she's gone. I swear I'll change
I need a car
I need an engine that runs
