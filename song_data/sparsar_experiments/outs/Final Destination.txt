Final Destination
by Swych.


Audi famam 
Illius 
Solus in hostes ruit 
Et, patriam, servavit, 
Audi, famam, 
Illius, 
Cucurrit, quaeque, 
Tetigit, destruens, 
 
When. I die bury me on the moon on the moon 
When I die. Hope Pac. Tell me I'm a real dude. 
Hope pops tell me I'm a real dude know. He looking down 
I, don't see too many real dudes. When I look around 
Jeezy told me they all either dead or in jail. 
I skipped both I had a show to do in ATL 
And. I was super turnt up, swag, steady, bumping, 
I, keep it front and center. You could never say I'm fronting 
Like a carving in a pumpkin, see the fire in my eye, 
I'm going harder than Contra because you only get one life 
And. Sometimes I want to cry wonder why we have to die 
But. I never find a explanation. 
So, I'm living everyday with a exclamation 
Because. You never know when you gon' reach your final destination. 
Rest in peace, 
 
Poem Shay Brooks 
We have to learn to love a little, even if it means ourselves 
And we can dress. However, we want - and it is never gon na matter - none of that
ever matters 
And the best way to admit you, love. Someone is to shout about it on rooftops in
your own way, because whats the point of doing anything if it doesn't create
memories 
What's the point of going somewhere. If you never go the full mile, If you love
what you do you do not just say you love what you do, you have to shout it it
even if it is into a void of nothing as long as you go home at night and look
at yourself and see The beauty in yourself, 
 
When, I'm gone, who gon' miss me Who gon' diss me 
Who gon', wish they had the chance to tell me how they felt and kiss me
 
Who gon' take care of my estate, Who gon' meet me at the gates. 
Will I get to see the greats and play video games with Biggie knowmtalmbout
 
Super Nintendo Sega Genesis 
How about that N64 Next, levelish 
He didn't get to see it wonder what I'll never get to see. 
I'M gon na be a legend wonder what I'll never get to be. 
They can disagree. I don't have time to let it get to me 
Busy, making history black
