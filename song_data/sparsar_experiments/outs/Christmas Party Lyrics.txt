Christmas Party Lyrics
by 3LW.


Won'T you get up. It'S a party 
What you waitin on 
What. You came here for 
Why. You sittin there for 
Playing that role, 
Actin, unsure 
What, all that for 
It's Christmas, it's a holiday 
Time for shopping, spend that money 
We gon' party cause. I know you wan na dance, 
 
Hey get off the wall, 
Get on the floor. 
And get to steppin, 
Hey, kill all the talk. 
Get on the floor, 
And get to steppin, 
 
Won't. You get up out that corner 
Throw ya, hands up 
Get, yo man's and them up 
Hurry up before the DJ, quit 
Spinning that- 
Playing, that- 
Hot stuff can't get enough. 
So, don't stop 
Til! You get enough! 
Get on the floor. 
It'S that time of year again, 
 
Treach's Rap 
Vamp, Out
