Torr's Empathy Jam Lyrics
by Swirlies.

I have a complex about how I look in t-shirts with big stretched-out necks. 
I have been exposed to the products of life without love 
As. Well as the products of superior genius 
And. As usual, I haven't the slightest idea of what to tell about where I've
been and what I've been doing. 
Me and my lover. We keep our treasure trails to a whiffle 
We're connected at our hip and in all our orifices. 
I was just with him last night in the shower: 
They were like Dude get with us 
And I got with them. 
I'M lazy, but something always interesting happens. 
 
Kicked out of mom's house 
Kicked out of dad's house 
But. I think it's justice that we're using to blow off all our negative steam 
 
I've had to do some stuff that I couldn't even tell you about. 
Writing home is like walking on glass. I have to edit my life 
Tell everyone what they want to hear, but what about the truth? 
You could get killed. Oh my god, I'm so fucking scared to die. 
I should be able to tell you the truth. 
I'M mentally unstable, obsessive 
I feel as if my family thinks that I have different priorities than they do 
I. Don'T think they understand that I don't have priorities 
The highest priority in my life is making love
