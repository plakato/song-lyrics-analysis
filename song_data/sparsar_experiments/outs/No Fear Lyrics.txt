No Fear Lyrics
by Zip K..


Is he a myth. Is he the truth? 
Oh they said they six show me the proof. 
This ain't, no style. This ain't, no trend. 
I been like this. Since the begin-nin' 
I been waiting on the rest of 
These imitators to catch up 
When. They think you quiet. You give um a melee 
Bitch, you guessed it come through with that Maco like yeah yeah 
I, don't like fame that shit lame 
Never liked lames, y'all, niggas, strange 
The. Only person I can be is myself. 
That shit never took no help. 
 
When the smoke clears 
And. I look in the mirror. 
I, don't have nothing to fear. Cuz 
They can't be me 
No way: aye 
 
The only person I can be is myself. 
That shit never took no help. 
 
Got dammit. I love my haters. 
They complain. Bout, the sound like neighbors 
I know you niggas at the house, workin 
It's, just Whatever happens, stays there like Vegas 
I took year for a hiatus 
If. I knew who I'd be a year later: 
Hi-C fruit punch, no label, 
The same old juice, got ta brand new flavor 

We lookin at you, niggas like stevie 
I, listen to you, niggas, like foxy 
Oh. That'S the reason this shit so easy 
Pack got me tuned out. No pitch correct 
I hit my connect to get a disconnect 
I'm on my you can get with this or you can get with that 
Aye and I don't need no fuckin help for that. 
 
Every morning I wake with a chip on my shoulder. 
Like 
I feel sleep eatin nachos on my sofa like 
I know plenty chips will make bitches get so polite, yah, yah, 
Think bout, the ones temporarily over hyped 
You live for the day and they bury you over night. 
Not me nah, nah, fuck 
So. I stay true POP hold it down. 
Stayed me kept it proper, 
Any problem shit. It ain't, no problem. 
Cause Whatchu want 
My, niggas got um, 
That ain't me I'm non violent 
But. I can't speak for everybody. 
And whatchall y'all sound like 
Everybody 
And, who y'all look like 
Everybody 
And, who gone top me 
Ain't. Nobody, bitch, aye, 
,
