Lost in NY Lyrics
by Ry.


It'S been a long year, wonder where you've been/ 
But. All of this time, you were there with me/ 
There with me. Now you were there with me/ 
 
So. When you make the table, can you save a place/ 
And if the food gets cold? Can you save a plate/ 
Save a plate for me, you were there with me/ 
 
And, she said/ 
, 
The, front door stays open and i know it. Ain'T snowing/ 
But, i'm kinda in the mood to see a christmas movie. Tonight/ 
… with you by my side/ 
 
And. What do we feel like watching? Let it be Malculy Culkin/, 
And, we're both home alone, so i'm feeling like i'm lost in NY/ 
… with you by my side, you by my side, now/ 
, 
December 24. Just me and the stars/ 
Reminiscing on the year barely noticed it passed/ 
Not bad for the kid who was the clown of the class/ 
Don't mean to toot my own horn. So I wrote you a card/ 
 
I'm standing at the door, see my cousin's arrivin'/ 
I'm. Visiting the home, where they still call me ryan/ 
Don't, think this visits quick. They bout to be here all night, man/ 
Mums, on the phone other hand on frying pan/, 
 
Standing, with my old man, preparing the playlist/ 
Springsteen on maybe some miles. Davis/ 
We spent the entire year working for payslips/ 
Me and my tunnel vision yeah, just like them. Reindeers/ 
 
I told you one day, I'll play festival, hall/ 
I'll, be on the same stage. They saw Lennon perform/ 
 
Let me thank my fans now just for all their support/ 
When. I make the radio I'm bout, give you a call/ 
 
Yeah a miracle. On 34th street/ 
My parents put the presents out when we'd fall. Asleep/ 
I was 8 roller blades and a frisby/ 
Leave the game boy at home. I ain't taking it with me/ 
 
I. Remember as a kid watching, carols on nine/ 
We can decorate the tree. Maybe give it some lights/ 
Ry be careful where you're, stepping just don't walk on the vine/ 
It looks awesome from the window. Still it took you all night/, 
 
Damn, I hoped my sister wouldn't get better presents / But 
On the real. I couldn't get better. Parents/ 
Despite the discussions, despite all the fussing and fighting 
I ain't talking, I'm just keeping it private/ 
 
One day, I'm going make it I'mma buy you the world/ 
Picket fences and a house. You'Ll have diamonds and pearls/ 
'Cos. It still trips me out. People give me applause/ 
I do this for my fans. My fan base are like my based gods/ 
 
Ain't, nothing like December Night's/, Hell, Yeah/, 
I, ain't, religious, but Jesus Christ/, Amen/, 
I worked so hard and we're eating tonight/ 
And. I can do anything if you're there by my Side/, I Said/
