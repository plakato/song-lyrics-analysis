30 (Deluxe Album Version) (New Recording) Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Well, we never had the time to plan our life. Past 30 
We were bullet proof through the roof. Nothing could ever hurt. It. 
Never gave a damn about the other side of the hill. 
Nothing could stop us, nothing ever will 
And. When we hit the stage. Lord you'd never know 
30 came and went a long time. A go. 
 
We rocked the 80's like we thought they would never end. 
We can still bring the house down like we did way back. When 
We can cuss, we can fight. We can go all night. 
Still tear it up, even though 
30 came and went a long long time ago, 
 
We were 25 so alive, nothing, but the road on our minds, 
It, was a rocked out knocked out, sold out, show every time know that 
We were jukebox dreaming and that life We make our stand 
Burning through the night headed for the promise land. You know where that
is 
Well we must've lost track of time cause we didn't know. 
30 came and went a long time ago. 
 
We rocked the 80's like we thought they would never end. 
We can still bring the house down like we did way back. When 
We can cuss, we can fight, we can go all night, 
Still tear it up. Even though 
30 came and went a long long time ago, 
 
We rocked the 80's like we thought they would never end. 
We can still bring the house down like we did way back. When 
We can cuss, we can fight, we can go all night, 
Still tear it up. Even though 
30 came and went a long long time ago, 
We can cuss, we can fight, we can go all night 
With. The help of pharmaceuticals, 
30 came and went a long long time ago, 
 
And the 60's up ahead. Yes, it is ...
