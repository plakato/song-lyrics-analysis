Fantazmic Lyrics
by 4th Pyramid.

C-Rayz Walz 
Yo, who it is What we live, 
With a gift, What you feel 
 
4th Pyramid, 
It's fantazmic with our pants sagging 
Till, the casket live with the plants; magic 
Get. Your stagger stuck in this damn ballad 
Yo, this pattern's bugged, on some old jazz hit. 
Orgasmic on a more rap tip 
When I spit that means raw dog. No prophylactics, 
Wrap dicks, spit flows of acid 
Stack chips play Madden laughing with Ak, bitch 
, 
Akrobatik 
Bitch, better have my money. When I rap fly 
At your venue, then the party can continue 
The way. My music blend through recalls, tempt you 
Stealth tactics, precise without practice. 
Call me Akrobatik cause my lyrical backflips 
Be, stunning white boys and lubricating, the black chicks 
Peace to Mr. Lif. We be dropping the fat shit, 
Niggas blast this 4th P, we FANTAZMIC 
 
Yo, who it is when we spit 
What. We live in your cribs 
With, a gift that enrich 
What. You feel for this hit 
Summertime type script, 
Above the mind of the stiff, 
Fantazmic bliss.. 
Come, to find it exists, 
Yo, who it is when we spit 
What, we live in your cribs 
With, a gift that enrich 
What. You feel for this hit 
Summertime type script, 
Above. The mind of the stiff, 
Fantazmic bliss.. 
Come to find it exists, 
, 
Akrobatik, 
Top shelf. That'S where you placing my vinyl 
Happy on the street date like you was acing a final 
Cooling in your dorm room. When the song hits 
Puffing on strong shit. Pressing rewind between bong hits 
Honeydip shake it till your thong twists, 
With the psychedelic relic. You could sing along with 
Ask me what I did when I visited the Bronx kid 

4th P 
Lost in mantras, constant contras, mommas, goners 
Gone in orbits calling often shit 
, 
C-Rayz 
The force of conscious nonesense common's clash with karma 
Coughing kids, who cough from awesome, spliffs 
 
4th P 
Lost in stardom, harvest, martyrs artists, 
Starving narcissists, hawk them gifts, 
, 
C-Rayz, 
Pompous rhythms and guarded gauntlets guns and Gods. 
The, given dearly departed artist living in this 
 
Yo, who it is when we spit 
What. We live in your cribs 
With, a gift that enrich 
What. You feel for this hit 
Summertime type script, 
Above the mind of the stiff, 
Fantazmic bliss.. 
Come to find it exists, 
 
4th, P, 
Variety's, the spice of life. They say 
That's why I say: fuck sobriety'least, twice a day: 
Spiked punch straight off the cactus 
In Nike dunks, inhaling some Backwoods 
Think about flowers, blossoming 
In, the bosom of the beast 

Whenever. They come hollering 
, 
C-Rayz, 
Following Rayz in a blaze, shea stay buttery, 
In, a maze of bullet strays, haze and Hummer jeeps 
Players and summer freaks, 
Beats, so lovely streets, so guttery 
Is it, the clubs that we tear up or the other emcees 
Whose music. I can only listen to with earplugs 
I'm like that Yea, what type of fellow that rock an all year cut. If my
beard's plush 
With a propellerhead hat the new black's burgundy Fantazmic, bastard, bliss rich
internally, 
 
Who, it is when we spit 
What. We live in your cribs 
With, a gift that enrich 
What. You feel for this hit 
Summertime type script, 
Above the mind of the stiff 
Fantazmic bliss.. 
Come to find it exists, 
 
Fantazmic, bliss.. 
Come to find it exists.
