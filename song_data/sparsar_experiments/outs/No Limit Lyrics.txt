No Limit Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


Bitch i'm a soldier.
A No limit soldier.
I thought that I told ya.
Ain't no need to ask me why I'm a soldier til i die.

Magic.
I'm a soldier see the tank on my neck?
Mr. Magic is my name y'all better give me respect.
You might remember me from seein' me postin' up on the block.
With a .45 Glock.
And a mouth full of rocks.
Hustlin' like I didn't even care.
Wakin' up my neighbors poppin' pistols in the air.
Tryin' make a million pullin' all night flights I'm praying cuz I'm.
Knowin that my life ain't right.
Forgive cuz I'm wrong but I'm begging or forgiveness.
And now I'm hustlin' in a whole other business.
Tryin' to do right for the people that I hurt.
In the process of growin up.
I've change my ways i guess thats why I'm blowin up.
I'm comin' back for all my peeps.
Just try to stay alive and keep your ass off the streets.
For the ones that gotta hustle just to eat.
Lord, I say a prayer for you before i fall asleep.

Magic.
How man heard Sky's the Limit?
Shit i ain't finished this is only the beginning.
I'm with no limit.
Just think I'm in my prime.
If I'm not the best just give me some time and I'll change your mind.
Niggas like me hard to find.
Genuine I'm the only of my kind young black and full of pride.
With a mind to teach the whole world.
If you just listen to my words.
Y'all can feel my pain.
A lot of years wasted, buku friends died a lot of wet faces.
The other half caught a bunch of fuckin' cases.
So still a lot of tender spaces.
Wish I could erase the hate.
Who said money makes you happy?
It can never bring back my daddy.
So fuck the Navi and Caddie.
I'm hopin' y'all could hear me.
Cuz I'm speakin' this from the heart.
Me and my fans never torn apart.

Magic.
And to the haters that be hatin' on my click.
Find a spot in line or suck a nigga's dick.
I'm gettin a lot of call now.
Bunch of fake bustas I couldn't ever trust ya.
Fuckin blood suckers.
Want me for the gift that you never thought I had.
I saw your other side, but fuck it I'm mad.
You say a lot of shit but you never ponit the finger.
I'm guessin' that Mr. Magic gon' remember.
Surprisin' a lot of so called superstars.
Passive comments but really don't want go to war.
Not with me my reputation stands for itself.
Just pull the disc out can't keep it on the shelf go and get it like.
It's the last one left.
I work the piss out the people who press 'em.
I thank the lord for such a wonderful blessin'.
Every word that I speak is a lesson.
Hard to believe that this nigga is from the projects.
