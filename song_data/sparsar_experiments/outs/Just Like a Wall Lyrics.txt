Just Like a Wall Lyrics
by Russian Red.


On my way, way to the stars, I found?
You were there, laying down, next to a hole.
Oh, hold me.
You said, you had faith in God above.
But it seemed that you didn't believe.
In reality, in people on earth.
In people to whom you've given birth.

And I forgot to call you.
This is just what I do.
You stand there just like a wall that.
I can't even try to talk to you.

I wrote down all of your thoughts.
Well, the ones you let me see.
When you're not watching TV.
You said you'd go for a walk.
But that was three weeks ago and now.
You spend your time counting the pages.
Of a second hand bible pocket edition that you have.

And I forgot to call.
This is just how I work.
I stand there still like a photo on your hands.
That you can't try to explain yourself.
