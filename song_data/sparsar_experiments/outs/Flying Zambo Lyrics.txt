Flying Zambo Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Let's lay this out like the numbers that dot your wrists.
Can't fake the clout, the letters ain't worth the stress.
We're skating over the light in the sheen.
I'm kicking over all the rocks in the scene.
This is new to you.
Why can't you feel relief?
It's too easy, it's too easy, it's too easy like the spark on a tv.
It's too easy, it's too easy, you're too easy, the movie never lies.
Static starts to break through.
Static starts to break you.
Static starts break through.
It turns me inside out.
Pull the credits down.
Keep the comments away from my mouth.
Keep your voices down.
With two thumbs up, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.
It's too easy, it's too easy, it's too easy like the spark on a tv.
It's too easy, it's too easy, you're too easy, the movie never lies.
Static starts to break through.
Static starts to break you.
Static starts break through.
It turns me inside out.
But the letters never dieâ€¦
