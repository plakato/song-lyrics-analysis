Skillz Lyrics
by XO-IQ.

I ain't serving up dinner.
I am serving up skillz.
I was always a winner.
I am serving up skillz.

You're just a beginner.
Cause I'm serving up skillz.
I'm serving up skillz.
I'm serving up la la la la la.

Way you act.
Tell me way you act.
Hollerback baby.
Hollerback.

Let me show you what I'm working with.
When they take a short of infamous.
Way you act.
Tell me way you act.
Hollerback baby.
Hollerback.

Let me show you what I'm working with.
With with with skillz.
Look at what I'm working with.
Skillz.

This is what I'm working with.
With with with with.

You say that I'm cray cray.
They so love to hate me.
And so do their mothers.
I'm friends with their brothers.

I'm calling you all out.
Prepare for the fall out.
All of you follow.
La la la la la.

Way you act.
Tell me way you act.
Bring it back.
Baby bring it back.

Let me show you what I'm working with.
When they take a shot of infamous.
Way you act tell me way you act.
Bring it back, baby bring it back.
Let me show you what I'm working with.

With with with skillz.
Look at what I'm working with.
Skillz.
This is what I'm working with.
Skillz.

Look at what I'm working with.
Skillz.
This is what I'm working with.
Skillz.
