Ah Life Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Principal Victoria she whistles while she types.
She reads the editorials of people she dislikes.
It went so fast, it was your life.

Michael and Victoria they live in Central Park.
The got the money from an uncle, eaten by a shark ???
It went so fast, it was his life.
He takes cream and sugar in his coffee.
She takes tea, okay, alright.

Glory, Glory, here comes Gloria.
Leaves a number by the bed, he should have thrown away instead.
Glory, Glory, divorce lawyers.
Such is life, ah, such is life.

It went so fast, it was your life.
He takes cream and sugar in his coffee.
She takes tea, ok, alright.

Glory, Glory, oh Victoria.
Cries herself to sleep at night underneath the moonless arbor.
Glory, Glory, Poor Victoria.
