Going Insane Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

I'm going insane going out of my mind.
Does he know, does he know, no he's totally blind.
I am such a good time when I'm with him.
Does he know, does he know that I wanna win his heart?
Going outta my mind and I'm going insane.
Does he know, does he know that I don't have a brain.
Am I totally lame to wait for him?
Does he know, does he know that I wanna win his heart?

I'm going insane going out of my mind.
Does he know, does he know that he's gonna be mine?
He looks totally fine when I'm with him.
Does he know does he know that I'm gonna win his heart?
