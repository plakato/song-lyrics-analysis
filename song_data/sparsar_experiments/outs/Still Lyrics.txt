Still Lyrics
by Rushlow.

All right, all right, well, it was on my sixteenth summer.
At the pool where we both went swimmin'.
That I first saw you, so cool like a star in a movie.
Sun tan, man you took my breath away, you take my breath away.

And I'm still head over heels for you, still fallin' straight into.
A love so deep I can't get enough and you still have got a young girl's grin.
That will cut a grown man right in two, whenever I'm with you.
My heart won't be still, my heart can't be still.

Seventeen, first date at the drive-in.
Nineteen, her parents askin', boy, where's this gonna go.
Well, I said it'll last forever.
And right then I knew I was gonna love you, the way I love you.

And I'm still head over heels for you, still fallin' straight into.
A love so deep I can't get enough and you still have got a young girl's grin.
That will cut a grown man right in two, whenever I'm with you.
My heart won't be still, my heart can't be still.

I still got it bad and I guess it shows.
From your pretty hair down to your painted toes.

And I'm still head over heels for you, still fallin' straight into.
A love so deep I can't get enough and you still have got a young girl's grin.
That will cut a grown man right in two, whenever I'm with you.
My heart won't be still, my heart can't be still.
My heart won't be still, my heart can't be still, all right.
