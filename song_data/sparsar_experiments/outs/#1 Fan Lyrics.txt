#1 Fan Lyrics
by Voltaire.

I hear your voice.
And the world goes away.
I see your face.
And this place is okay.
Oh, for just a moment of your time.
Oh, now, that'd be sublime.

Do you hear me?
I'm here for you.
You don't see me.
I'm way in the back of the ballroom.
I've been here since last night at nine.
I was the first in the line.

You make me cry more than.
Anyone I've ever met in my whole life.
You made me smile despite myself.
I live for you, I wouldn't lie.
You made me love you more than I.
Love myself.

Corner cafe, random meeting.
Is that really you there?
Scrape me off the ceiling.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
Now, I don't know what to say.

You are the sea and the sky.
And I'm content to not know why.
You are so great, I am so plain.
I am that moth to your flame.
...Wish I was good enough for you.
