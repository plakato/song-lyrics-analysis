Aire Lyrics
by Unknown.

The rose.

Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed.
Some say love, it is razor that leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower &amp; you its only seed.

It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance.
Its the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance.
It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give.
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live.

When the night has been too lonely &amp; the road has been too long.
And you think that love is only for the lucky &amp; the strong.
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows.
Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the.
Rose.

@love.
Filename therose.
