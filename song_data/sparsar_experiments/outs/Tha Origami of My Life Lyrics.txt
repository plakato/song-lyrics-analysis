Tha Origami of My Life Lyrics
by Punkstah.


I used to def jam doing crime, sell some dope
In the night on the club. Bang some hoes
Rapping was a bitch. For me. Hustling was my wife
Get. The cash check, the gat ready to fight
A homie, said ,'why waste in 25 to life'
When. You got skills like a mac. 10, so fine
With the dope ass beat and the beasty flow
I never looked back in no hustling, no more
Man. I got skills i can kill with the beat
You spit for yourself, i spit for my streets
This song is for every inches of dhaka
A shout out to all of? U mothafuckas
Its a street shit for you, so turn system up
And smash everything whats up, front
Punkstah is the name. Remember till u, die
I can see the fear right through your mothafuckin. Eyes

The streets know me cus. They know the shit. I'Ve been through
Im, maybe new to the game, but im still oldschool
My story goes through every words and every line
Thats, the origami of the streets and origami of my life, 2x

in bengali
Dui hazar, noy, theke, tero, chaar, bosor, dhoira, kapaisi

Je, jei, kothai, bolse, buk, fulaya, agaisi
Punkstah, ke, eita, shobai, Ke janaisi
Welcome to the hood theke D.O.P.E
Same flow, same rhythm e ami kapaitesi
Shuru, hoile, toh ami ar thamte chai na
Ar kawre, toh akhn ar chance dei na
With underworld, hiphop crew, niggas can't fuck with us
We the real souljas. We only aim to bust
Vxl raf saz and alter ego
Emon on the beat thats, how shit goes
To all the homies in the corner put your hands. Up
To all the brothers on th streets, put your hands up
To, all the hoes. I used to love bitch stay down
To, all the beefers that wan na beef bitch stay down
