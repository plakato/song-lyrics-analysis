Scottie 2 Hottie Lyrics
by Two-9.


Naacp can't no bitch excite
me 
I need a Rolex, no Breitling 
if them people spot me, 
I call for god for lightning 
I'm going hard and your pockets hurt. 
I, see why you don't like me. I see why you don't uh 
Clicquot Enrico I'm all
about them C-notes 
Your main ho, a fall-see-toe Falsetto Falsetto 
All. My work correct, though shout out my connect, though 
I swear, I breathe the best smoke some my tree from the deck, though 
Can't cop, no weed at Texaco. 
Some of these niggas still stressing, though 
I'mma teach them. My lesson, though I teach them my lesson
though 
Popped, a bean popped popped, a bean 
Aye popped, a bean popped popped, a bean 
Ho 
 
I just got a pack, tell my bitch roll. It 
Tryna' stack that paper to the point where it's not folding, 
Can't, no nigga do like me, 
Vodka straight no chaser 
Only after that paper, but them fuck, niggas, still hating 
Two-9 to that grave dirt. 
Smoked out till my chest hurt 
Good weed in my dutch red box
on, my t-shirt, uh 
Niggas pocket watching too much to count 
That checkered flag waving. When I come around 
Yeah it's waving when I come around 
If your bitch ain't at the crib that mean she came around 
Yeah that mean she came around 
And that checkered flag waving. When I come around
