40 Seconds Of Fury Lyrics
by Unnamed.

Yo, listen close, I got a mic, so nobody's stopping me.
I'll say what I got to say, and you're forced to listen to me.
For the last time I ain't a motherfucking G.
I'm just a kid, with a mic, and I'm rapping like a God you see.
Remember that there ain't a chance of stopping me.
Now listen to a true MC.
Before I go and shoot MCs.
Look, I ain't here to cause trouble.
Just giving you music and above your head appears a thought bubble.
You think, What if he was famous?
Would he still be heinous?
Would he like the fame?
Or will he quit the game?
Or will he end it all by jumping in front of a moving train?
I don't know, I guess we got to wait and see.
But till then a disappointment is all I'll ever be.
Cause rap made me crazy, rock made it worse.
Now everybody wants me in the back of a hearse.
Man, I wish my life wasn't so fucking boring.
Wish it was party all night, sex every morning.
Fucking bitches early while they're still yawning.
Wish I was the shit and I would never be falling.
As long as I'm alive motherfucker I'm ballin'.
