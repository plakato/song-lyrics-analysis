Smoke Break (Interlude) Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


She said I smell like weed and mistakes, I told her she my perfect distraction.
She told me keep going with the music, cause a nigga starting to gain a lil.
traction.
Life's a blur in between me and her smoke sessions, every smoke break I learn.
another life lesson.
She a blessing.
