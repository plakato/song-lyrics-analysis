The View Lyrics
by The Yung Fusion.


Yung Fusion and Jordan Cassius.
I can be the one for you.
We can probably get a room for two.
We can watch the stars from the roof.
Cause I do enjoy the view, of you, I do girl.

Westside, West side.
Whatchu' know bout my beach?
Jet life so fly girl we can go chill in the East.
Put that body on me I feast.
No game but I play for keeps.
Next line ain't talking swimming....
Cause i'm going like 7 miles deep.
Got me lost in this game, got me lost your eyes.
Set it off with a bang, and we off to the sky.
Got me lost in your lane, never park when I drive.
I hit that thang all day all night.
Dirty dancing in this room.
There's no telling what I'd do.
If I had to live this life again I'd choose the same view.
Of you girl...

I can be the one for you.
We can probably get a room for two.
We can watch the stars from the roof.
Cause I do enjoy the view, of you, I do girl.

One time for the ones.
One time for the ones with data but no daddy.
She said she good cause she baddie.
I said I sad I uhh saddie?
How is she lovely when she isn't loved, Stevie.
I told you don't do me like that, you did it, Stevie.
But we good cause she good cause she know that she baddie.
She said to give her good D, she just needs a Zaddy.
But I want to give her my all.
My A to Z.
Take it easy, RIP Eazy E.
No shade, see the view, no canopy.
Open the can of peas.
Get this green with me.

Yung Fusion and Jordan Cassius.
I can be the one for you.
We can probably get a room for two.
We can watch the stars from the roof.
Cause I do enjoy the view, of you, I do girl.
