Never been this far Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Ice on my shades wearing them daily keeping an eye on those holes my tats.
show work of art on these walls my tats show work of art pictures on my body.
best art of all paper trees on my hands can't think straight where should i go.
confusing words hard to read with glasses on call up the eye doctor to see.
better.
