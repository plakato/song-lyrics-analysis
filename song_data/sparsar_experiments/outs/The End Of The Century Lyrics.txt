The End Of The Century Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

Eyes that used to see.
Heart that once did feel.
Mind that used to think.
Hands , the hands could touch.
Mouth that used to speak.
Opened wide in deadly silence.
Legs that made him walk.
Won't make a single step no more.
Here they come.
Just to take it all away.
Spilling blood everywhere.
Feeding themselves withhate and pain.
Damned.
Damned children of the end of the century.

Take me away.
Don't let me go insane.

No one's safe.
Nothing holy.
Brother kills his brother.
Child kills a child.
Days of terror.
The cult of hate.
Superstar with the blood on the hands.
Stares at you.
Talks to you.
Sleeps with you.
Becomes you.
And you kill without a reason.
You kill just to kiil.
Destroying all that's human.
Love in you and me.
And you , you , you still call yourself a man.
To me you' re a beast with a human face.

Take me away.
This is the end of the century.

Look into the eyes.
Of the one' s you used to grow up with.
You' ll see fear.
The darkest fear at the bottom of those eyes.
I' m afraid of you.
And you' re afraid of me.
I don' t trust you.
And you don' t trust me.
Sorry so sorry.
I just wish I 'm still a man.
A man.
