Cultured Man Lyrics
by The Zolas.

I want to be your cultured man.
Who doesn't jump off of the bus you were riding.
Run as fast as his legs can go.
To return the previous night's video.

Then sprinting to catch up.
By the next bus stop.

Just to impress you my love.
Just to impress you.
Just to impress you my love and sit back beside you.

I want to be your talented man.
Who doesn't wake you in the morning having cooked us something strange.
And when you go for supper at his folks.
Doesn't burst in through the door and announce to them.

You're never gonna guess.
Who I brought as a guest.

Cause your blood is family too.
So come to the table.
Your blood is family too now sit down beside us.

Pouring wine and pushing opinions.
Taking drags, ignoring the dishes.
The worlds we unwrap off the top of our heads.
You and me and my folks between dinner and bed.

When months they pour into years and more.
Will he still be holding car doors for you?
