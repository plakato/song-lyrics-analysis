Amaze Me Lyrics
by Union J.

Little things that you do.
That we share me and you.
Are where I breathe.
You still blind me with such wonder stuff.
Just one touch is all I need.
It feels like I'm falling into sun.
Even on stormy days and.
Every way it feels like we've won.
As we watch the years go by.
It feels like we're still flying high....
Baby you amaze me.
You still knock me off my feet.
Who would have ever guessed it would last.
Through it all the reason I believe.
Can't you see, you still amaze me.
You still amaze me....
Funny how everytime that I'm down.
You pick me up, you stand by me.
People ask whats the deal.
Why you still so in love.
Well maybe it's meant to be.
It feels like I'm falling into sun.
Even when life is like, a fight.
It feels like we've won.
As we watch the years go by.
Its feels like we're still flying high....
Baby you amaze me.
You still knock me off my feet.
Who would have ever guessed.
It would last through it all the reason.
I believe, can't you see.
You still amaze me, oh, oh yeah.
It feels like I'm falling into sun.
Even on stormy days and every way.
It feels like we've won.
As we watch the years go by still.
It feels like we're flying high....
Baby you amaze me.
You still knock me off my feet.
Who would have ever guessed it would last.
Through it all the reason I believe.
Can't you see you still amaze me.
Oh you still amaze me....
You still amaze me....
You still amaze me....
You still amaze me....
