Waiting For Your Love Lyrics
by Q5.

You may be proud, so sentimental
You think too hard, but the answer's simple
Got what I'm askin' I got. The feelin'
I got to know now body. You must decide
Cause I'm waiting waiting for your love
Cause, I'm waiting waiting for your love
When. The time comes, I hope. You'Re ready
Make your mind up: try not to cry
I'll. Take it easy I'll make you feel it
When. You know there can be no compromise
Cause. I'M waiting waiting for your love
Cause. I'M waiting waiting for your love
I've made my mind. Up
I'M gon na have you
Cause. I don't care what your best friend will say
You're. What I need to set my life free
You know what it takes to make me stay
Cause, I'm waiting waiting for your love
Cause, I'm waiting waiting for your love
