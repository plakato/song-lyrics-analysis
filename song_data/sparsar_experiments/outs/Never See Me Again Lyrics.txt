Never See Me Again Lyrics
by Two-9.


Jack Daniels in my hand, I
don't do percs need xan, 
Think yo, baby mama is a fan, lame niggas, scram, 
Yo bitch, miss Piggie, goin' ham. 
Don'T make her bo peep when she hop up in that Lamb 
Niggas in the street. Don'T give a hoova dam 
But. I, like a Hoosier, I'm a rooster for the fam 
Used to be a loser. Now, I'm worth a hundred grand 
Not here for the fuck shit check, isn't up 
It ain't up fo' discussion, 
We rollin' blunts they like 12 32 
Its 4:30. Now what the fuck I'mma do with like all of these blunts and 
Smokin' weed till I don't know where the sun is 
Me and myself, and I mean what the fuck shit 
Drugs is like all that I fuck with 
And all of these bad bitches love. It 
And know that the good got the label 
Good gas, good gas know that I blow it 
If. You got a pro'lem nigga say it. 
Othawise muthafucka, don't show it 
And. I swear to god inner light 
Karina if it's poppin' ho 
But. If you wan na go fo' it 
Green light, it's a fuckin' go

I just need a fuckin' bitch to put the shag on 
Then I'll, be someone that you can turn your back on. 
I'Ll hypnotize you early in the AM 
Swear you'll, never hear from me again, 
 
What's up haters. Tell me: how have you been 
I haven't seen your face since I was a kid 
Say, lil fam, oh he's ahead of the rest. 
I, don't do nothin' that I'm gon na regret. 
I know somebody's been lookin' for me. 
I know somebody's been by my money. Machine 
I found a band in my washin' machine 
And. They only playin' Washington's 
I'm on the shroom. Soon the room is going zoom, zoom 
This, that new school straight out the lagoon doom 
Man. I count the fuckin' cake, like I'm. An ex con 
Lamborghini wax off chop wax on
