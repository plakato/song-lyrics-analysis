General of the dark army - 2055628 Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

Beware the General, his army comes to call on the dawn.

Face your death with pride, he will watch it and smile.
And feel good inside.
Senseless, running is, he'll rip you apart.
With eyes as bright as stars, he will slaughter you all.
Without remorse.
He'll swim in the flood, sustenance is blood.
There's no end to the night, forfeit your life.

Hunger for the dark.
Striking for the heart, blackened from the start.
His evil crawls into your mind.
Sending shivers down your spine, he is the night.

Insane, his primal instinct compels him to destroy.

He bleeds the ominous, the power he displays is infernal.
As fallow death he comes, the mountainside will shake with his might.

Crush your soul to ash, no escaping his wrath, he's built to last.
Clasping at your soul, he'll swallow you whole.
Pain will make him soar, he's impenetrable, in time of war.
Terror blinding your sight, paralysed by the fight.
He's master of all, the Dark General.

Hunger for the dark.
Striking for the heart, blackened from the start.
His evil crawls into your mind.
Sending shivers down your spine, he is the night.

Stone the innocents, Know they deserve it.
Rejoice in carnage, Know they deserve it.

Mark my words, retribution will never come.

Hunger for the dark.
Striking for the heart, blackened from the start.
His evil crawls into your mind.
Sending shivers down your spine, he is the night.
