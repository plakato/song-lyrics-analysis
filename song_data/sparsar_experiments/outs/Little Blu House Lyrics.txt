Little Blu House Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

Little blue houses.
Sitting high on the mountainside.
Little blue houses.
Sitting high on the mountainside.

Oh, to be high on the mountainside.
Oh, to be high on the mountainside.

Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent.
And I could stay here for a while.

Little safe houses.
Sitting high on the mountainside.
Little safe houses.
Sitting high on the mountainside.

Oh, to be safe on the mountainside.
Oh, to be safe on the mountainside.

Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent.
And I could stay here for a while.

Little blue houses.
Sitting high on the mountainside.
Little blue houses.
Sitting high on the mountainside.

Oh, to be high on the mountainside.
Oh, to be high on the mountainside.

Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent.
And I could stay here for a while.
