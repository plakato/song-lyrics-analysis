Highlights Lyrics
by XP.


XP's Living the lavish life.
With his happy wife.
Except he's not married and he's a kinda ugly kid.
Who's only living half a life.
While this is true.
I bet you bubble gum pussy ass rappers aren't half as nice.
I might grab a knife and watch the passion ignite.
As I say good-bye to tonight.
I remember I got suspended on my birthday.
My worst day, they called my mom while she was at her workplace.
I remember when they said my granny passed away.
Last word to say that I was always gonna be okay.
At her her funeral I couldn't even cry.
Cause if sky is the limit then she destined to fly.
See the fact that I'm a rapper doesn't mean I'm just good with words.
It means I have a message and something I wanna show the world.
It means that even though I'm a little unsure.
Maybe theres a little something that I wanna show theses girls.
Every rapper raps how they the nicest.
But knowledge doesn't come with a tag that shit is priceless.
I don't really wanna worry bout how long I might live.
I just wanna worry about the impression I might give.

I don't even fucking know man.....
