Decay Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

You know how to fall.
Take this heart throw it out.

How you swoon and fall.

You hold too much in stall.
Take these hands, take this heart from the wall.

Scorpions at my feet.
Bloated arms, decaying teeth.

You know that I want to live.
Dark night upon the innocent lips.
Forage the decay from the inside of your hips.
Scream prostrate light from your throat.
