Blue Blue Sky Lyrics
by Alan Parsons.

I only know what I can see.
So I imagine what could be.
Where the horizon cuts the air.
Look for me out there.

Someday I'll touch the blue, blue sky.
Someday I'll touch the blue, blue sky.

If I could kiss this earth goodbye.
And cruise the never-ending sky.
Where the horizon cuts the air.
Wait for me out there.

Someday I'll touch the blue, blue sky.
Someday I'll touch the blue, blue sky....
