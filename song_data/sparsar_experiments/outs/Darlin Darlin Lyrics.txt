Darlin Darlin Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Where am I going to get some sleep.
Where am I going to get some sleep this time.
Light a candle, light a cigarette.
I bet the world is on fire.
I don't knowâ€¦ I know it's much too late.
I've been here seven hundred times.
And I' m well aware that I'm not likely to regret leaving them behind like.
this.
They came from underneath my bed.
They stood around me and said lay back we're going for a ride.
I said the knot was way too tight.
Take the chair my spine can't wail all night.
Pin my eyes I'm going to get some sleep.
My faith has been retired.
Clean my suit I have to look just right.
I've got one nail left in me yet.
It's sketchy stop screaming.
I think I am dying, collapsing, kids barking you're so jealous.
Will the girls still like me nine days from now.
They will paint my face and fix my hair like LEE.
God how I'm the envy of them all.
Blame Seattle, blame the fake toupee.
It's all about to tremble so change direction.
I'm headed out to see this time.
