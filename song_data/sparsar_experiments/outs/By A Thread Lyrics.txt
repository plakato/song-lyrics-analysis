By A Thread Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Slow down, you've got a lot to see.
A lot of things to hear from me.
You'll never catch it all, as fast as you fall.
You can't control everything.
Take it as it comes to you.
Just breathe.

All you'll ever need will come to you in time.
Keep waiting patiently.
You're hanging by a thread.
So when you come to me.
I promise there'll be better days to see.

Right now, you've got a lot to do.
Believe me, I believe in you.
You weren't born to fly but at least you try.
Don't be let down.
You're not invincible.
You're only human: it's all you know how to be.

You can't control everything.
Take it as it comes to you, just wait.
I haven't seen it all.
It takes awhile to find ourselves.

All you'll ever need will come to you in time.
Keep waiting patiently.
You're hanging by a thread.
So when you come to me.
I promise there'll be better days to see.

You want to make a stand.
To make the smallest change.
Or maybe save the world.
And if you need a hand.
I just want you to know that you are not alone.
