What If? Lyrics
by Viza.

Inside the wallpaper peels until the morning light.
Magicians appear to be in black and white.
The dancer is blind from all the candlelight she chokes.

Ease back and listen to the fire char down below.
Take back the liquor and the venom that corals your ghost.

What if we could live a better life?

Outside the garden of eden is where the children cry.

The mystery tends to never wanna die.
The dancer is there but will you ever try to cope?

What is worth fighting?
Heaven is inviting.
He who enters will find that no one is there to embrace.
