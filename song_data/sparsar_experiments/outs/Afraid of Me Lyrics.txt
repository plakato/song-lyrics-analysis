Afraid of Me Lyrics
by Twiztid.


I'm so, hidden and you're never gonna see.
I'm cold, forgiven all because of my beliefs.
I'm no...body that you ever wanna be.
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me.

Now you can try to sedate me, assassinate or just hate me.
But there's nothing that you can do to me lately.
Now I'm greatly accepted in the mind so I'm confused and intertwined.
From being rejected so many times, I wanna leave it all behind.
So kind of you to pick up the album and give it a try for once.
And run and tell your homies that these motherfuckers will die for us.

So many questions, fingers pointing for answers.
Suggesting that I'm the cancer that lingers inside the pasture.
With green grass up to my neck, and situations that's too fast.
To think about and most people can't dream about.
A hundred million miles and every single second.
And every time you hear this record I want you to feel me on every sentence.

Reminisce from descendants of past treasures.
We'll embark on a journey that'll stay alive forever.
Plus I would stand over on my side of the fence.
Regardless of the circumstances or the consequences.

I am my own worst enemy.
I'm not the smartest motherfucker and shit, I don't pretend to be.
And why I am the way I am is not a mystery.
My mind's not in proper working order or in therapy.
Deranged confused and mentally abused.
Life's been hanging on a string so what the fuck I got to lose?
And what the fuck I got to prove to you?
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know me.
You can put that on my real homies.
I got problems and they stack like bills.
And I relate to the broken, bleeding heart love killed.
And I awaited in the shadows, awake in the dark.
Hoping to talk to the passed on, I'm falling apart.
I'm such a mess indecisive, I'm.
fading away.
I'm out of touch with society and living today.
Never relying on my sanity, I throw it away.
To become the maniac that's got your attention today.

Can you keep a secret?
Well I'm afraid world because they want me to die.
Can you believe it? But I'm still alive....
And been floating since '95.
With my chin held high but I'm so dead inside.
Let the problems just roll and put them back into a pile.
Because it's just a bunch of shit that I can't deal with right now.
And I'm tired of always guessing and messing it up again.
And the next day it's even deeper and I'm steady sinking in.

I took a look at myself and came to grips with what I found.
It was a vision of a child, disturbed and broke down.
No soul, no heart because I gave it away.
No time for feeling sorry, I'll grieve another day.
And all those tears are stored in storm clouds.
That hover above me and cover the ugly.
Continued to haunt me when I was feeling low.
That's the same reason I hold on and never let go.
