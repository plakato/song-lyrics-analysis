Laniakea Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


1 2 3 4.

A familiar turn of the century hurls.
That optimism is a better word.
My eyes are swollen at the sight of it all.
The youth are dominant, we gotta do well.
And all the magic was chisled down.
Until all the magic just can't be found.
A leader cries and I'm not sorry for them.
And they can't use our baths to wash all their sins, when....

All the brothers and the mothers and the lovers.
They all sing out!

I'm inclined to lie in one place.
To see how many lives I can live.
I flew to the sun and I stole her hat.
And then I flew right back but now I feel so bad.
I dug a hole in a well to see who's about.
I inclined within the sky and I.
I talked to God and she laughed with me.
About all the books are him and all the rhymes are he, and all the....

I went swimming in the dark one day.
Lights done flickering and I'm awake.
I went fishing in the stars one time.
If it's hope that kills me then I won't die 3x.
