The Flow Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

Come on girls.
Speak through the microphone yeah!
Don´t be a fool.
Remember your color's blue yeah!
Hey you!
Ooh ooh ooh!
Hey you!
Ooh ooh ooh.
I'm the next in the list to become a tripulant.
The Flow is coming down my spine.
I know how to do a fun funk song.
I know how to do a fun funk song.
And I don´t think of you anymore.
No I don´t think of you anymore.
