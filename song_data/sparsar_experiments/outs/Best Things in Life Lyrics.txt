Best Things in Life Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.


I've got a saying in my life that's got me by so far.
Well it mat not be right but, nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong.
The first mistake is leave it up to somebody else.
If you want something done you got to do it yourself.
I'll do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me.

Because nothing comes easy for a man like me.
Everybody thinks the best things in life are free.
If they would open their eyes it'd be so plain to see.
That the best things in life don't come so easily.

I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me.
He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree.
It would have been alright but he pushed me too far.
If your looking for trouble step outside of this bar.
IF it comes down to fisting, mister that ain't nothing new to me.

You'll find in this life if there's something that you believe.
You got to get your hands dirty when it's something that you really need.
If they ever give you something too easily.
Can't be too good, cause nothing good's for free.
Tell ya' straight from the heart a bed of roses it will never be.
