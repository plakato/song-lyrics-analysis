There's a Rainbow Over the Range Lyrics
by Quebe Sisters.


It's a grand and glorious day.
And the clouds have rolled away.
The fading thunder spills in the far off hills.
There's a rainbow over the range.

You must have the rain to have a rainbow.
And the clouds are bound to come along.
First the clouds, the rain, and then the rainbow.
Then all nature sings a happy song.

There's a rainbow over the range.
And the skies are blue again.
The rollin' thunder's spills in the far off hills.
There's a rainbow over the range.
Hear the cowboys yip-e-io.
While the doggies mill and low.
The sun is riding high in the prairie sky.
There's a rainbow over the range.

I've been told there's a pot of gold.
At the end of the rainbow lane.
But I've found that trail just a magic veil.
That's born in the sun and rain.
