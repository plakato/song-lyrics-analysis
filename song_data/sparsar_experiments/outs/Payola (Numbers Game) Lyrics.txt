Payola (Numbers Game) Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

The devil can judge.
You're on the same side looking in.
The grass is orange.
A whore to the spin.
A degree is a crutch they sold you.
100,000 thin.
Now your fathers selling off the last drop.
Now your mothers selling off the grave plots.
More than a number.
Spare the world the trust fund perspective.
Your tongues too blue.
Williamsburg is safe for the rich kids.
Just choose the avenue.
One day you'll wake up and realize.
It's a numbers game.
Guess who's caught holding the last.
Guess who's caught roaming the same blocks.
More than a number.
One day you'll realize.
