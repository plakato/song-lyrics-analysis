In Evolution Lyrics
by Yungtown.


I'm the next revolution.
In a match with you, my wounds stay proven.
My influence is amusing the masses through the music.
Each move, so elusive when I swoop in undisputed I'll go.
Loosen every single main proven method that keeps me from the title.
I'm not a psycho, just passionate.
These throwback cabinets are my battlements.
In each match my attacks stay ravenous.
In a bracket where I am a protagonist.
I'm rapidly blocking every impact accurately.
It's the satisfactory.
That I get from the crowd's reaction, we just can't contain this capacity.

You're up, it's time, get ready.
Don't know what's coming next.
But we're 'bout to take it over.
What else did you expect?
You fall, I rise up to the skies. That's where we belong.
I was born for it.
This tournament.
Yeah I'm the next revolution.
In Evolution.

When I step up on the stage, the levels moving, I'm proceeding.
Lights shining down.
Sticks are clicking.
People always screaming.
Gotta reach up to the top.
Can't be stopped.
When I follow with a complicated combo, patiently you know I'm scheming..
Reaching.
For another win to discover this potential that I have to uncover quick.
And every throw and poke has me on the edge of my seat, but this rush has me.
loving it.
So Imma keep on, going 'til the beat drops and I defeat ya.
Regardless of the outcome you know I'll be back next year after I evolve.

You're up.
It's time.
Get ready.
Don't know what's coming next.
But we're 'bout to take it over.
What else did you expect?
You fall, I rise up to the skies that's where we belong.
I was born for it.
This tournament.
Yeah, I'm the next revolution.
In Evolution.
In Evolution.
Yeah, I'm the next revolution.
In Evolution.
In Evolution.
Yeah I'm the next revolution.
In Evolution.
