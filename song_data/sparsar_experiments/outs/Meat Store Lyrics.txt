Meat Store Lyrics
by Woop.


We keep beef like fucking meat sto'.
Every Glock got a dick, deep throat.

All my niggas, we get papers, Kinko's.
All we know is warfare and bullet holes.
I'ma buy the top shit and watch 'em plummet.
Real recognize real and you look funny.
Used to play it dark and dirty like a dungeon.
Now I'm paid, telling jokes about the money.

Rich niggas telling jokes about that money.
Got the swag, got the look. You just lack the funds.
I can't lose, gotta feed all of my niggas food.
Break the rules, grab a skully, make a business move.
Pyrex pot got my traphouse filled with monkey knots.
Greet them twats, we don't talk, we just send Hello shots.
Niggas cops, catch 'em dining at that donut spot.
Think it's sweet? Think you're tough? Nigga, call my bluff.
Made the pot Skrr! Skrr! Hillary Duff.
We come through, niggas move, ambulance truck.
Trigger finger itching so I throw up number one.
Rich niggas having convo's 'bout that fucking money.

Hit you for the soft, hit you for the crack.
Hit you for the loud, hit you for them racks.
Hit you from the front, hit you from the back.
Nigga, them my shooters, I ain't talkin' sex!
Hit 'em for the drop off and don't hit 'em back.
I'ma kill a nigga if I hit with that.
Every day we geek cause we off molly rockers.
My cooker got his mask on like a doctor.
Me and my niggas in too deep like we some diving partners.
That ain't just my homeboy, that's my robbery partner.
Gangsta in my eye but I put got first.
And I'm pulling home invasions for that hard work.
