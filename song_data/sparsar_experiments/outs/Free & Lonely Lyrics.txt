Free & Lonely Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.

Go back home.
Get a job and get paid.
Marry a girl.
Go home and get laid.
Buy a big old house where we both can live.
Have a couple of drinks and have a couple of kids.

Whoa oh, and I, I left my life behind.
But I ain't got time to look back on.

When I was free, when I was free.
Free to be who I want to be.
Free to not care, ahh.
When I was free, free and lonely.
People would see me on the street.
They'd stop and stare.
When I was free.

La la la, la la la la la la.
La la la la la.
La la la.

When I was free, yeah.
Free and lonely.
Free and lonely.

Move out west.
Living hand to mouth.
My Hollywood plans have all gone south.
So I move back east where I can pay the rent.
But she want a big old house with a big old fence.

Whoa oh, and I, I left my life behind.
But I ain't got time to look back on.

When I was free, when I was free.
Free to be who I want to be.
Free to not care, ahh.
When I was free, free and lonely.
People would see me on the street.
They'd stop and stare.
When I was free.

La la la, la la la la la la.
La la la la la.
La la la.

When I was free, yeah.
Free and lonely.
Free and lonely.

Free and lonely.
When I was free.
Free and lonely.
People would see me on the street.
They'd stop and stare.
When I was free.
