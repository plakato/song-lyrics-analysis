Oh No Joe Lyrics
by Rusty.

You gotta problem that's pretty plain.
All my pleasure caused you pain.
You sneak around, you write my number down.
Your body's sinking, you gotta swim.
Oh no Joe, leave us alone.
Your living in the past.
Oh no Joe, leave us alone.
Your living in the past.
Oh no Joe, leave us alone.
Times gotta a way of closing your eyes.
You should have seen it coming.
You could have tried.
You sneak around, you write my number down.
Your body's sinking, you gotta swim.
Oh no Joe, leave us alone.
Your living in the past.
Oh no Joe, leave us alone.
Your living in the past.
Oh no Joe, leave us alone.
