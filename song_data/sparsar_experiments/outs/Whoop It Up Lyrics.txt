Whoop It Up Lyrics
by Zippy Kid.

Whoop it up!

No biggy It's burster from me!
I'm organizing it hastily.
This unknown quantity.
When it's jarring the dancefloor.
Whoop it up!
Everyday I start again.
My daughty resistance.
And it's crisping my style.
You will be smitten after my pungent scurry.
Allow me to observe how you nerve yourself.
In our irregular scrimmage.
I wanna spark ya all with my sturdy richness.
I wanna swoop on this innovative brilliance.
With next proposition: let's dance!
***.
Glide with my frisks.
Test yourself for this hop.
If you figure on resort to force.
I'm gonna acting on the spot.
I mean to say we can squeeze through that sordid jeopardy.
Steady on with that opacity.
I cut away some of the amenities.
Are you able to identify yourself as the unique one?
I will be glad to join our convictions together.
How nice. Do you, do you want to form yourself into my crew?
Whoop it up! It's for you!
***.
I'm gibbering expressly.
I'm vindicating this consequence.
Push the matter through!
We are the shivers of obscurity.
I wanna be plain with you.
Push the matter through!
Can't ya see.
We are the toys of fatal democracy.
***.
I'm rendering active.
The exit from my knotty frustration.
I need some brain's expansion.
Our indigested stuff is too obsolete.
Climb up from this pit!
Yeah! You can determine.
How to follow your sloppy road.
And to reach after the last sunshine.
Don't be falling short!
Blast your addiction, leave it and dot!
You must learn to control your freedom.
When it's gone.
But it will be waiting for your return.
Don't be fixed again.
***.
The mercury is rising.
It's my fast set.
And the rhymes are too cranky.
Huddle together, get funky.
I'm proving out that I have quick wit.
Let me hit, hit off my fantasy.
C'mon rabbits and toads. Jump back!
I'm waiting for my dramatic train.
Last Sunday I was melting away.
Now I construct myself again.
***.
I've put forward my gumption.
Take a little time to measure up your irony before penetrating.
I respect you for ferriting about this scoop.
I made certain of my route.
What can I do to pep it up?
What can I do to whoop it up?
Can we switch the complexity over?
I'm gonna invoke all sobriety from my head.
Stop gloating me over!
I was sandwiched between my competence.
And this perspective.
I'm gonna invoke all sobriety from my head.
I was sandwiched between this stage and dream.
I'm gonna invoke all preciosity from my head.
Otherwise, it will set me back.
