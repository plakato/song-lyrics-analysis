Random HeartMeadow Garden (Final Phase) Lyrics
by Tyler Major.

Who you know gets more digits than addresses 
And stretches out all over his beats like matresses 
Number one flight out of the airlines. 
Never tell me twice to touch the mic, its a shame. You won't share eyes
 
The blind guys get more loot than the seein kind. 
Devils come to knockin the signs to schemin the shine, 
The images of villains, aligned, they see ghosts 
While. The visions in my mirrors are ratchet from seen smoke. 
Obscene jokes. They tell in the lunch lines, 
Always hurt my feelings. Never cried just wrote another line, 
Horrific grammar. No periods to space quotes 
Now im in the back with the tv rememberin space ghost 
Late nights, -- -by the way it sounds right. Alright 
Enough flow in his rhythms memorize to lock jaws, tight 
Hes your hero, like that crusader cape 
Will, never rhyme a fruity line in his life along the lines of strawberry
crepes 
Now its time to set the bait like a bow and arrow 
He who shares knowledge of Rhymes gets the golden sparrow 
\ -- prize, received as gerald 
\ -- -the life and times of a moses singing past carols 
\ -- --, the mic is intact, 
Nobody will ever meet the man again come close, get back. 
They say you can find him in the moment. Hence the ones chosen 
Got more backlash than salvia when its potent 
Catch me in the lab and watch ideas spring open, 
\, -- -youll, never understand the lesson until he spokes it
