Coffee Lyrics
by Yuna.


I'd rather stay inside than being out tonight.
Just sipping coffee and nothing to look forward to.
Savoring my solitude.
And no one will ever know you the way I do.

In high definition I'm dreaming of you.
With my disposition I'm losing my cool.
With my everything I'd give anything to be with you.

And I will try my best to let it subside.
I'm letting go without taking any part of.
Something what my heart truly wants.
And no one will ever see you the way I do.

In high definition I'm dreaming of you.
With my disposition I'm losing my cool.
With my everything I'd give anything to be with you.
In high definition I'm dreaming of you.
With my disposition I'm losing my cool.
With my everything I'd give anything to be with you.
