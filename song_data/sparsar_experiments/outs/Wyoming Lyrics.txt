Wyoming Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

Rewind the moons to where this all started.
I knew I'd lose you to the first shot, it's just my luck.
I gave you wings so I could revise it.
But you told me that a pen, has always been enough.
Honestly? I think you made it up.
Cause all along, I've just been writing you this song.

So set it off, here we go.
We've gotten to sleeping in our clothes, not cause were cold.
Cause we don't know who will be there in the morning.
So set it off, my heart is shot, this is me giving all I've got.
God let it be enough, cause if it's not, this is me giving up.
Writing another useless melody that goes.

Late another evening she's casually faded.
Wearing it well cause she's a lady.
Under the sultry matte of summer.
And the allusion of Great Gatsby.
Saying she's sick of me, but she's lying on my floor.
She's a six for me when I can't take more than a four.
She still means so much more than.

So set it off, here we go.
We've gotten to sleeping in our clothes, not cause were cold.
Cause we don't know who will be there in the morning.
So set it off, my heart is shot , this is me giving all I've got.
God let it be enough, cause if it's not, this is me giving up.
Writing another useless melody that goes.
The way our story does:.
Writing poetry in the back of my car, smoking cigarettes with the dome light.
on.
The wind graceful on the paint-job, inside hazy like a dive bar.
When it comes to stopping my heart she catches each and every beat on time.
And when it comes to picking winners? I don't ever take the line.
Cause I'm flattened by everything, she's beautiful.
I've got the spins, and of all the things she ever did.
This won't fix itself without me helping it.
So this is it, just another useless melody that goes the way our story does.

Say what you'd like about us.
This just means a little more, no, so much more.
