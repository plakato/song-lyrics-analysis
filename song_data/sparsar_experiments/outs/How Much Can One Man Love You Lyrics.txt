How Much Can One Man Love You Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


I know my back can bend and bear the weight.
But these two hands of mine, they never shake.
At least not up till now.
So many heartbeats and it's never missed.
I'm not sure if it can handle this.
I guess I'll find out.
I guess I'll find out.

How much can one man love you.
How much can one man care.
How much can one man need you.
How much do I dare.

I know my eyes can see for miles and miles.
And my legs can walk a good long while.
That's never been in doubt.
But I always keep my passions locked away.
So what will happen now, it's hard to say.
Once I let them out, I guess I'll find out.

If I never let you go.
Maybe then I'll know.
