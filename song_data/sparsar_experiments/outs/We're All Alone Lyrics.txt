We're All Alone Lyrics
by Zsa Zsa Padilla.

Outside the rain begins.
And it may never end.
So cry no more.
On the shore, a dream.
Will take us out to sea.
Forever more, forever more.
Close your eyes my dear.
And you can be with me.
?Neath the waves.
Through the caves of ours.
Long forgotten now.
We?re all alone, we?re all alone.
Close the window calm the light.
And it will be all right.
No need to bother now.
Let it out, let it all begin.
Learn how to pretend.
Once a story?s told.
It can?t help but grow old.
Roses do, lovers too.
So cast your seasons to the wind.
And hold me dear, hold me dear.
Close the window calm the light.
And it will be all right.
No need to bother now.
Let it out, let it all begin.
All?s forgotten now.
We?re all alone, we?re all alone.
Close the window, calm the light.
And it will be alright.
No need to bother now.
Let it out, let it all begin.
Owe it to the wind.
And hold me dear.
Oh, hold me dear.
All?s forgotten now.
We?re all alone, we?re alone.
And it will be alright.
No need to bother now.
Let it out, let it all begin.
All?s forgotten now.
We?re all alone, we?re all alone.
