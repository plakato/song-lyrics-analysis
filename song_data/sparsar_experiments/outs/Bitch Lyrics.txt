Bitch Lyrics
by Blood Duster.

Don't you know it's a long way, To the top if you wanna rock Earning money the.
hard way Or should I just go get a job Being broke as a broke ass bitch Nearly.
all the time Struggling with all the rent and shit Just trying to earn me a.
dime Oh yeah, I'm a broke ass bitch Oh yeah, sellin' meth I'll get rich Name a.
band and I'll tell you They ain't got but a cent Jed Whitey will tell you It.
ain't all about the rent Its about making fun of people And all the things.
that they do And when it comes to the bills and shit I'll leave that upto you.
Oh yeah, I'm a broke ass bitch Oh yeah, sellin' meth I'll get rich Boom.

sellin' meth I'll get rich Broke as a broke ass bitch Feedback.
