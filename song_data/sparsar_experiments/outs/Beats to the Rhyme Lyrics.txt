Beats to the Rhyme Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

D.M.C. 
DJ's and MC's coming up next is the one and only 
Incredible Jam Master 
Yo back up off the ropes, punk 
 
Run 
Beats to the rhyme. The rhyme I just made 
Party at the jammie til lights. The night fade 
Trooping for the feature we all get paid. 
So, let's go 
 
D.M.C., 
Yo D. That'S me! The King, the MC 
Rhyme get mine on the t-o-p 
Can another MC ever rock. This beat 
 
Run-D.M.C. 
It's, like the A the B to the C 
It's easier than 
 
So hit. It Run 
It's time for we to cease. 
So rhymers speak your peace 
Why Cause. You can't touch 
Cause he's number 
Dance to the rhythm, the rhyme, the cold flow 
Chance that I gave em is done. I told yo 
For these routines, like 1983 
It's. Just a little reminder. 
So. Those suckas is kinder 
A little message from 
 
Run 
Cuts for days. Will amaze and maze 
But will make you sad to tan all the dance, aways 
Got, the mic, the man, the master plan, 
But the ram the jam 
 Goddamn 
Spins, he wins. Clocking endless ends 
To his friends. He lends lotta joy, he sends 
Jay lose today. This is what I say: 
 ), 
, 
D.M.C. 
My beats were played and laid rhymes made. 
Jay DJ'ed and I got paid 
Made something out of nothing 
Yes. My brother, I would do it for you. 
I roam in the zone of the microphone 
And, I'm on the throne, but I'm not alone 
Got bones of steel and not of stone, 
I'm known to be prone and make your momma moan 
, 
Run 
Time for the rhyme. So let the stars shine 
Shame for the fame and the name combined 
Run for the fun, but you can gim me your ring 
Show. I got ta go so now a word from the King 
 
D.M.C. 
Hardcore rhymes galore, giving you more 
And, like I said before. ... 
Beats to the rhyme the name of this jam 
D. That'S me and that's who I am 
Rocking on the mic cause. You know I can 
You got ta understand. I don't give a damn. 
 
Run 
Jay hit a play today. I must say 
Hooray to the way that is A-OK 
As. We wax the tracks. All the DJ's play: 
With 
A little 
A, big
