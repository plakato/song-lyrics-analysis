Do Re Mi Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.


In this world that we in / you can lose or you'll win / but it's never a draw.
/ and as quick as you can make it / it's a hater tryna take it/ don't be.
thinkin' life is easy it's hard / I got some girls that I know / who get with.
guys for they doe / but they ain't happy what's the use of the wealth? /.
Turnin' tricks like a Retriever / what's gon' happen when he leave her? / See.
that's why you gotta do for yourself / This world move so quick I.
hyperventilate breathin' / runnin' through the city ain't no time for grievin'.
/ so many hate livin' but too scared to die / hip-hop is the way that we cry /.
ghetto lullabies.

Became a sinner right before a winner.
When I was born,on the 12th day of October.
In uniform, was a soldier when I came out.
Walked through the door.
See my whole block banged out.
We in a war.
Killer street but I'll never let it, take me alive.
Bought a heat cause I'm gettin' sweated, gotta survive.
It ain't cool while my mom pray.
For me at home.
I be sittin' hittin' bombay.
I know it's wrong.
Momma tellin' me I need God.
And I ain't well.
But the homie with the weed got, that clientele.
Gettin' money so I want mine.
I be like dang, when it's sunny cause it don't shine.
On me it rain.
I complain cause it ain't fair.
Like dying over what you can and you can't wear.
Who cryin' 'bout us?
Out of sight so we out of mind.
They say a soldier gotta fight so I got a nine.
That's bottom line.
Ghetto move so quick I hyperventilate breathin'.
Runnin' through the city ain't no time for grievin'.
So many hate livin' but too scared to die.
Hip-hop is the way that we cry.
Ghetto lullabies.

I ain't dyin' until I share my diary with this globe / a little mad man.
sippin' on a brew when it's hot / ghetto taught me how to blaze for the days.
when it's cold and / mama dead broke and had us thinkin' we not / eyes wide.
shut stealin' with ridiculous speed / I was rippin' off the tag if it was.
somethin' I need / somethin' I wanted / we was buyin' chronic to blunt it /.
started servin' it / profit margin moved to the hundreds / had to stop it.
though cause Phyllis didn't raise no crooks / not to mention focus shifted to.
the girls with doe / light-skinned to the mocha it'd be on fa sho' / get the.
20 dollar Remy pay a dub for Mo' /.
I started slippin' up I thank God I'm still alive / cause if it wasn't for Him.

hard gotta break free / remember that you can't enjoy ya doe without the RE MI.
/ we move so quick I hyperventilate breathin' / runnin' through the city ain't.
no time for grievin' / so many hate livin' but too scared to die / hip-hop is.
the way that we cry / ghetto lullabies.
