Anagnorisis Lyrics
by Bodi.


Never, let em down Now how's that
sound 
Who you gon na hold. If you can't see the ground 
How you gon na stand up. If you were built to fall 
How, you think you're gon na soar, hoping you're, not gon na stall, 
All alone. Born to roam 
Borders sewn off from each other 
call it home 
Go and try to mend the sand, but who
you think will give a damn 
Let the Waves break and 
Let the tide. Take you 
Out of the race erased 
You escape to- 
Night, underneath moon 
Light. You can see whose 
Might's gon na reach to 
Heights. You can't leap to 
Fright. That'S what keeps you 
Right, where you think you 
Like, but the flight-fight eats you
alive 
And. You can't decide whether you should speak or stand or run 
Or hold your tongue or reach the end 
defend or lend a hand or gun. 
And you've become everything. You said you wouldn't 
And, you can't hold the world because you never understood it. 
Crooked little smile that you aim 
At the man in the mirror, framed where you place the blame 
Foolish little useless simple-minded. You believed 
That. You could breath and change the world before. It came your time to leave, 
And, see the hands of fate and stack the deck against it. It'S naive, 
That! You could call a bluff on lady luck with ace inside her sleeve 
Who. You think you are talking to your shadow 
Try to save a world locked in a civil battle. 
Gallows overpopulated preaching to
the congregated 
Converted is how sense is made. 
Of flags turned to army blankets, 
Weightless cause. You can't hold your own 
And soon. All you are is a name on a stone 
Cold case close tagged, toes made
those choices 

Rattling around inside of your head. 
Who, you think, will care in the end when you've fled, 
Less self or selfish. It'S high-time
you learn 
As the flames rage, you'll watch, em, all burn
