Double Vision Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

Help me out and hear my selfish plea.
He'll run away someday but he was in love with me.
Lord, please help me put these thoughts to rest.
He has another woman, he'll never be the best.
Lord, can you expel my evil prayer.
I love him all the time but I know it seems unfair.
Tell me now, let me know which love is real.
I don't know very much but I know the way I feel.

One is the enemy, been running all along.
One is the one for me, don't know where I went wrong.
One is the enemy, been running all along.
One is the one for me, don't know where I went wrong.

Help me out and hear my awful cries.
He loves me all the time but he only tells me lies.
Lord, please help me put these thoughts to rest.
He has another woman, he'll never be the best.
See for me cause my vision's not so clear.
I can't help holding on to the demons I hold dear.
Tell me now, let me know which love is real.
I don't know very much, I don't know the way I feel.

One is the enemy, been running all along.
One is the one for me, don't know where I went wrong.
One is the enemy, been running all along.
One is the one for me, don't know where I went wrong.

He want to push me down, he's tearing me apart.
He wants to build me up and give me all his love.

One is the enemy, been running all along.
One is the one for me, don't know where I went wrong.
One is the enemy, been running all along.
One is the one for me, don't know where I went wrong.
