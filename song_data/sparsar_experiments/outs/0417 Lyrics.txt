0417.
Produced by Vo-Kal.

I won't hold back.
In telling you what I see.
Just me holding you.
As we fall into the sea.
I'm not trying to tame the ocean.
Girl it's all for you.
I would give the world.
But I'm broke.
So I wrote this song for you.
You're the one I will hold on to.
The one I write all my slow songs to.
Just tell me that.
You need me that.
Way I can feel it.
And baby know I can feel it.
Trust me it's more than a feeling.
I know you're gambling feelings.
To fall with me deeper in love.
No concealing.

Forever falling in love with you.

I'm forever falling in love with you.

Forever falling in love with you.

I'm forever falling in love with you.

We're starting to lose our breath now.
Closer into our death now.
The world is bearing down.
The world is crashing down.
Further away from a safe escape.
We plunge away deeper.
Not safely tucked away.
But you're the one I will hold on to.
I'll grab you tighter just hold on too.
Just tell me that.
You need me that.
Way I can feel it.
And baby know I can feel it.
Trust me it's more than a feeling.
I know you're gambling with you love.
To fall with me deeper below.
We can't see above.

Drunk as fuck.
When I approached you first.
Do you remember when.

I was on stage.
You were in the crowd.
Taking pics of me.
Up there wildin' out.
Fast forward a bit.
Our platonic date.
Our first argument.
Was about KanYe.
12 hours later.
When I hit the door.
I was thinking bout.
How I just needed you more.
You just needed me more.
And we proceeded to score.
On finding the ones.
We were each made for.
And we stayed for.
What our past.
Payed for.
Happiness.
Companionship.
My first love.
This random shit.
My obsession.
My instafix.
Your wall's down.
Your camera's fixed.
You see clear.
Your heart stitched.
Girl.
This camera flash.
Our first year.
Went too fast.
Chuck and Sarah.
Before memory loss.
SD card.
The scenery moss.
On the rocks.
Is this the right path.
Breadcrumbs are lost.
The way back.
To paradise.
Before heartbreak.
Falling in love again.
Like our first date.
