Can't Let Up Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

So just close your eyes now.
Until we're gone from you.

Oh.
Now I'm screwing up the program.
I'd just like to say that oh.
Now I'm screwing up this program, for you.
You.

Just know I'm taking over.
Just know I'm taking over.
I can't let up I won't shut up.
These words against you.

Just know I'm taking over.
Just know I'm taking over.
I can't let up I won't shut up.
These words against you at all.

So just close your eyes now.
Until we're gone from this.
Remove myself from this.
Now.

Take me on. Take me on.
Take me on. Take me on.

Just know I'm taking over.
Just know I'm taking over.
I can't let up I won't shut up.
These words against you.

Just know I'm taking over.
Just know I'm taking over.
I can't let up I won't shut up.
These words against you at all.

Oh now I'm screwing up the program.
Oh now I'm screwing up the program.
