Firedevil Lyrics
by Voice.

See the smoke at the horizon.
Feel the heat of hell swallow up your bloody sins.
Your dreams and hopes feel my cleaning flames.
See my shining signs.

Your cries and entreaty can't help you no more now.
My black breath burns in your watering eyes.
But nobody is at your side.

Run now, run, run for your life.
Yes I am.
I am the firedevil.
Get yourselves to safety.
Because I don't know mercy.
Run now, run, run for your life.
Yes I am.
I am the firedevil.
Recognize my wisdom.
Or you pay a painful pride.

Follow my glowing faces.
And believe in the power of my divine mission.
See the fire in my shining eyes.
And the fulfillment of my splendid visions.

Your cries and entreaty can't help you no more now.
My black breath burns in your watering eyes.
But nobody is at your side.

Run now, run, run for your life.
Yes I am.
I am the firedevil.
Get yourselves to safety.
Because I don't know mercy.
Run now, run, run for your life.
Yes I am.
I am the firedevil.
Recognize my wisdom.
Or you pay a painful pride.

Run now, run, run for your life.
Yes I am.
I am the firedevil.
Get yourselves to safety.
Because I don't know mercy.
Run now, run, run for your life.
Yes I am.
I am the firedevil.
Recognize my wisdom.
Or you pay a painful pride.
