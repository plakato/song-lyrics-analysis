Blue Sands Lyrics
by Yuna.

Oh blue sands, can you tell me if I ever be happy?
Oh blue sands, can I stay here forever?
Oh blue sands, I don't want to go out there and pretend.
Oh blue sands, can you make them understand?

And everything will get better if I stay for a while.
And we'll find another way to be happy one day.
And everything will get better if you hold on for a while.
And the sea come and sweeps us away from here.

Oh blue sands, will I ever get to marry my best friend?
Oh blue sands, will he ever understand?

And everything will get better if I stay for a while.
And we'll find another way to be happy one day.
And everything will get better if you hold on for a while.
And the sea come and sweeps us away from here.

Oh blue sands, will I ever get to be like you.

I don't hate you anymore.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't hate you anymore.

I don't hate you anymore.
For the way you remind me of the person I cannot be.
Can you take me away?
