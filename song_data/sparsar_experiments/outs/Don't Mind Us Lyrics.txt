Don't Mind Us Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

She'S, not nineteen, but she's got ID 
And. She walks nicely. So she got by free 
She's on the guest list, blessed with huge breasts 
That protrude from her chest with a dude in a Lexus 
 
Who knew once she stepped in the club, 
He'd be letting her hump 
Anybody that be getting her drunk 
 
Cause. She gets free shots, 
If the chick tease, cocks 
And, a 50-spot for the dick she'd suck 
 
The next day took her itchy muff 
To, the clinic pissin' samples into dixie cups, 
And, then she's off snorting on pixie dust, 
Drinking back a mickey. For a pick me up, 
 
Just, a club hopping slut talking obnoxiously 
Walking up Robson street on a drunk shopping spree 
Spending cash. She made from ass. She gave 
To, whoever tapped it and paid without asking her age, 
 
And. These are some people that we don't like much 
Just a couple: people that we don't like much 
Pet peeves. Get me vexed. Please don't mind us 
We're, just a couple MC's that don't like clubs, 
 
These, are some people that we don't like much 
Not you just some people that we don't like much 
If you fit the description. Well, listen, don't mind us 
Dance, retardedly, to R
