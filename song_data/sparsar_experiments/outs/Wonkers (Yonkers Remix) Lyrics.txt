Wonkers (Yonkers Remix) Lyrics
by Unonimus.


I swear I'm an enigma.
Take a rapper, put him down and stomp him like a sigma.
Floating, spitting while I'm killing cock roaches.
Wearing metal wristbands with a Caterpillar - broaches.
Lotus, I agree, life is out of focus.
Because everything is getting buggier than a freaking locust.
We're just some rappers who aren't noticed.
Yet we're better than the other rappers who are bogus.
I never swallowed Hennessy.
I live south of Tennessee.
And I'm getting tired of all these people acting friendly.
Here's the name of some singer singing.
Listen to him well, I swear he's awesome at lip syching.

Satan called, said he wanted my soul.
I told him leave me alone, I wasn't his freaking slave.
I mean, sheesh, there's so many rappers that he's paid.
It's like I've got the baton, this isn't a freaking relay.
Woke up at 3:33 and doing magic.
This is ECP, that's 4 kids who're rap addicts.
This ain't Dexter &amp; Jak or Clank and Ratchet.
But after playing, I went up stairs to check the attic.
I.
slipped on some brown sandals.
And ran around the house looking for a lit candle.
While I searched I found the fire place mantle.
I'm not dumb, I just wanted to see if I was flammable.
Shut up.
Ima red dot em'.
Do it right right in front of those people bed rocking.
And hum a little tune just to keep their heads bobbing.
And then I'm probably gonna end up med popping.

I know I'm a disaster.
So how about I make a group of rappers.
Along with my friends TimeBomb, Lotus, and Casper.
Respect, friends and motivation all I'm after.
So money, fame, and popularity don't matter.
So where the good ones at? I want to hear the master.
Seems like all rap is now is bling-bling, guns and swagger.
But rap will always need improvement.
Just made my first song and I'm a middle school student.
