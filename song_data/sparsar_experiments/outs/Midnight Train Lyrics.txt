Midnight Train Lyrics
by Union J.


I would run.
One million miles to the moon.
If I knew that you'd be there too.

Will you be there too?

I would cross.
Oceans and fields for your touch.
The sound of your voice ain't enough.

It's never enough.

I'm running out the door into the dark.
Guided by the beating of your heart.
Stay right where you are.
Tonight.
You have never felt so far away.
If I don't have you now, I'll go insane.
Stay right where you are.
I'm on the midnight train.

I will crawl.
Swim through the desert alone.
No footprints to lead me back home.

Never going back home.

Your body is a river, yeah.
It's twisting and it's turning.
I miss you and I miss the way you let me watch you burn, yeah.
Your body is a river, yeah.
It's twisting and it's turning.
I miss you, yeah, I miss you so, I'm running, running, running.

I'm on the midnight train.
I'm on the midnight train.
