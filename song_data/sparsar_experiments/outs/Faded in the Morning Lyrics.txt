Faded in the Morning Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

Words are floating through the windows.
And in the house she blows them away.

Faded in the morning time.

Haters with their hearts asunder.
Will ruin our parade.

Faded in the morning time.

Walking through the winter markets.
And all the horses floated away.

Faded in the morning time.

Sun is rising, stings my eyes.
And don't wanna die today.

Faded in the morning time.

Words are floating through the windows.
And in the house she blows them away.

Faded in the morning time.

Haters with their hearts asunder.
Will ruin our parade.

Faded in the morning time.

Walking through the winter markets.
And all the horses floated away.

Faded in the morning time.

Sun is rising, stings my eyes.
And don't wanna die today.

Faded in the morning time.
