Burn In Hell Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Spoken:.
Welcome to the abandoned land.
Come on in, child, take my hand.
Here there's no work or play.
Only ONE bill to pay.
There's just five words to say.
As you go down, down, down....
You're gonna burn in Hell!
Oh, burn in Hell!

Sung:.
You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life.
Without even trying, I've lived on the edge of a knife.
Well, I've played with fire, I don't want to get myself burned.
To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn.
Before I burn in Hell.
Oh, burn in Hell!

Take one good look at your heart, tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate.
Make your choice now, for tomorrow may be far too late.
And then you'll burn in Hell!
Oh, burn in Hell!
You're gonna burn in Hell.
Oh, burn in hell!

Hear no evil, don't you see no evil, don't you lay no evil down on me.
Speak no evil, don't you think no evil, don't you lay with evil, cause I'm.
free.
Hear no evil, don't you see no evil, don't you lay no evil down on me.
Speak no evil, don't you think no evil, don't you lay with evil, cause I'm.
free.

Oh, burn in Hell!
You're gonna burn in Hell!
