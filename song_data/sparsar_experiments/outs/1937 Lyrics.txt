1937 Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

Sea breeze. Waves and trees sway. Clouds surround the City by the Bay.
Two men. New friends.

Sea breeze. Waves and trees sway. Clouds surround the City by the Bay.
Two men. New friends.

The last talk. The last laugh. You stood still after the first half.
Now came the last glance to see that beautiful city.
Then you said, This is where I get off..

Above sea, man stands boldly at the edge of life and death.

You raise the heights of our dreams, and the depths of our graves.
And as a kid, never thought it would end like this.
The silence of the mind comes with the feeling of letting go.
Leaving loved ones who still don't know.
Today was finally the day you would find what lies behind.
