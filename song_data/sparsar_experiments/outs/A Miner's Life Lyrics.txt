A Miner's Life Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.


A miner's life is like a sailor on board a ship to cross the waves.
Every day his life's in danger, many ventures being brave.
Watch the rocks, they're falling daily, careless miners always fail.
Keep your hand upon your wages and your eye upon the scale.

Union miners, stand together.
Do not heed the Coal Board's tale.
Keep your hand upon your wages.
And your eye upon the scale.

You've been docked and docked again, boys, you've been loading three for one.
What's the use in all your working when your mining days are done?
Worn out shoes and worn miners, blackened lungs and faces pale.
Oh keep your hand upon your wages and your eye upon the scale.

In conclusion, bear in memory, keep this password in your mind.
Worker's strength cannot be broken when unions be combined.
Stand up tall and stand together, victory for you prevail.
Oh keep your hands upon your wages and your eye upon the scale.
