Ron Burgundy Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


I guess it's true the loudest niggas be the weakest ones.
And usually the price is paid by the decent ones..
I seen it happen more than often in my recent fun.
He poke his chest without a vest, he grab the peace he run.
Now he dressed in all black sayin peace to some.
Can't explain it to the kids, well at least they young.
I think a nigga automatic when I reach the tongue.
Especially when samples spinnin and they beat the drums.
I even think it's kinda crazy how I fell into this.
I was high school jock on some letterman shit.
Just a shorty runnin game on my Edelman shit..
Didn't make it now my memories is medals and shit.
I gotta couple of excuses and etc. shit.
But I made it to 22 without some federal shit.
On some hetero shit, I got love for my niggas fasho.
And you may have a lotta niggas but my niggas fasho.

Just a shortie runnin game on my Edelman shit.
Didn't make it now my memories is medals and shit.
I got shortie runnin game on my Edelman shit.
Didn't make it now my memories is medals and shit.

Mister I don't give a fuck up in this muthafucka.
Ain't too many I can trust up in this muthafucka.
I met the woman of my dreams it was a hard adjustment.
So much shit inside my past but I had to flush it.
Excuse my language I just say whatever feels appealin'.
Apologize to senior citizens...younger children.
But all you fuckers in between should prolly pay attention.
I'm rippin ears I'm Tyson.
Holyfield the Holy feel the sermons only deal to walk a lonely trail.
Despite intentions you intended for the ones that hold you still, for real.
All is God and God is only where you hold your fears.
Never let another soul control how you tryna live.
How often is you fakin' the funk.
Only time I get alone is when I'm takin a dump.
Only time I'm in the zone is when I'm facin' a blunt.
And only time I feel at home is when I'm scratchin' my nuts.
