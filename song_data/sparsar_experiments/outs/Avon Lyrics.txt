Avon Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


I see you go.
Through a park in a haze.
And I don't listen.
For traffic going the same way.
A simple system.
I string them up.
I cut them down.
Dare I say.

To to to to tox3.

A perfect vision.
Some simple ways to let you know.
Free range humans all cooped up.
Naked clone is playing.
lame.
I string them up.
I cut them down.
Dare I say.
