Switch Up Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


Ah, yeah, don't push me.
Don't make me switch up.
Switch, Swishhhh.

Mr nice guy, sometimes I wonder why.
I'm still the guy they wanna try.
I seen mothers cry, I seen babies die.
Real talk nigga, why would would I lie.
Everybody edging me now, cause they all feeling me now.
Don't listen to these rappers cause they are lying.
Every rapper is a killer no one dying.
Every rapper is a dealer who is buying.
Your tape got me crying with laughter.
Just wondering whatchu you gonna do after.
Bet its something I already did better.
I'm like the MVP in this league.
Everything I do, I do it big.
I do it for my town, said no to Motown.
Tell em pay me more, Drew Berymore.
Invite her to my show, young nigga got dough.
Like a pizza chef, lyrically dope as Mos Def.
I'm a young poet, sipping on moet.
Extra cheese omelette, waitress don't forget.
To bring one for my niglets.

All my niggas in this bitch.
Its two sides to a coin don't make us switch.

All my niggas in this bitch.
Its two sides to a coin don't make us switch.

You ain't gotta play me.
If you owe me you gotta pay me.
Its rules to this shit boy.
I will get my hittas on your door boy.
Don't make me switch up, switch up, switch up.
Don't make me switch up, switch up, switch up.
Don't make me switch up, switch up, switch up.
Don't make me switch up.

They all wanna be players.
But they don't wanna practice.
Its like the game ain't changed.
Niggas only wanna get laid.
Before they get paid.
Thats getting pussy on credit.
Yeah nigga, I said it.
I live on my debit.
I don't owe nobody shit.
Slim Shadyyyyy.
Everbody acting real shaddyyy.
Finally found a girl for me.
The type of girl that will go to war for me.
The only person that really cares for me.
Even on my low she row with me.
If I was a dealer she would grow with me.
You know its me, she blowing me.
On some Bonnie and Clyde.
Are you really gonna ride.
Come and stand by my side.
Niggas will sell you these days.
What did I tell you those days?
Now I'm the nigga they praise.
