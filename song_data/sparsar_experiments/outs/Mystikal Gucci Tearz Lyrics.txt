Mystikal Gucci Tearz Lyrics
by Yung Huf.


In the Gucci turtle neck.
As Lizzie McGuire licks my balls.
Kamehameha in her mouth.
On my badminton court.
Sling rock bigger than Dumbledore's beard.
All my cheeks got tears.
All my cheeks got tears.
Versace to the grave.
Even Versace IKEA.
Fucking with these ho's.
Tryna bust a nut like Spiderman.
Know I rock wheels.
Like Johnny Kapahala can.
Yung Huf AKA Yung Bambi.
I got bread like a pantry.
You from Japan? I wanna get in Japanties.
I don't know ho, don't be so anti.
Up top, hair with the fade like Kim Jong Un.
So how you gon' be so mad with those bee stings, hon?
Dick like a lightsaber.
Got her talking like Yoda.
Yo, what's life like sober?
Nudes on the Motorola.
Buckwild like a poacher.
Choppa in the Toyota.

Pussy on my face but I still play FIFA.
Pussy on my plate but I still ate pizza.
