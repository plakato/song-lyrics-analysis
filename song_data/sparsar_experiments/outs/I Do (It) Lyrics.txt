I Do (It) Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

Uh.
I do it.
I do it to you.

All you christians.
All you krishnas.
We do weddings &amp; bar mitzvahs!
We'll float with your parade.

No principles just vice principles!

We wouldn't lie.
you've got it made.
We'll tell you what you want as long as we get paid.

Satisfy the bride.
Fellate the groom.
To inflate your party balloons /.
We're gonna need a little bit more room.
Sure i'm qualified.
I'll do anything you say.
As long as i'm getting paid.

No principles, just vice principles.

We wouldn't lie.
You've got it made.
We'll tell you what you want as long as we get paid.

WE'LL PROSELYTIZE AROUND YOUR THIGHS.
THIS CONCERT IS SPONSERED BY THOSE FRENCH FRIES!!
