It's Always The Same Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Well, the bus that picks him up from work is late again, 
It's delayed on the other side of town 
Well. The street he's waiting on is kind of lonely 
'Cept for an old homeless man on the ground. 
 
He wonders what he's done so wrong to lose. His job 
While, the woman he loves, is with another man 
Although the homeless. Man is there, he knows he's all alone 
And he, let's off as few tears as he can 
 
All he wants, is to be happy. 
All he wants is a friend 
Cause, he's, tired of being so lonely all the time 
And. He thinks that it's the end, 
 
Letting go and giving in 
One of those games. You got ta play 
I know, love is always a sin 
Yea, It's always the same. 
 
All he wants is to be happy 
All he wants. Is that friend, 
Cause he's tired of being so lonely all the time 
And. He thinks that it's the end, 
 
It's, always the same ... ..., ..., ..
