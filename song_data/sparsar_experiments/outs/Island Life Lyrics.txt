Island Life Lyrics
by The Zolas.

In paradise, tropical greys.
I missed the wave again today.

Island life.
Is a moth in the night.
All this time.
We look out for a light.

I walk the streets, that hot ballet.
Won't someone look at me that way?

Island life.
Is a moth in the night.
All this time.
We just follow the light.

So I wait for you here.
On a permanent vacation.
You're the speck on the horizon.
You're a wild imagination.
And they say it's human to want.
But I want inoculation.
Wanna fall through the sand.
To an alternate dimension.
