All Women Are Crazy Lyrics
by Voltaire.

All women are crazy. 
All men are dumb 
Cause, though we know, they're crazy 
We still want some 
It's, nothing new 
And, it's sad, but true 
That. We just can't quit'em 
And. We can't live with'em 
What's, a man to do 
 
Back in the bible. 
There was a tree. 
Lord said to Adam 
Don't. You eat that fruit. 
He said Fine by me. 
But, then along came Eve 
Looking to do wrong 
And on account of her curves 
And. His lack of nerves, 
Adam went along 
 
Cause. All women are crazy. 
All men are dumb 
Cause, though we know, they're crazy 
We still want some 
It's, nothing new 
And, it's sad, but true 
That. We just can't quit'em 
And. We can't live with'em 
What's, a man to do 
 
Take, my old lady 
I bought her a gown 
We were fixing 
To go out, mixing 
Out on the town. 
She said: Do I look fat 
I said Heck no 
Just a little round, ... 
And, since that day, 
I've walked this way. 
It hurts to sit down 
 
Cause. All women are crazy. 
All men are dumb 
Cause, though we know, they're crazy 
We still want some 
It's. Nothing new 
And, it's sad, but true 
That. We just can't quit'em 
And. We can't live with'em 
What's, a man to do 
, 
, -- -Fellas. There comes a time in every woman's life ... About once a month, to
be exact. When they get all ornery.. Oh, they start kicking and fussing and
fighting and .... We don't know what's wrong with them. In about a week, they
generally come around ... And they'll. Look you right in the eye too and
they'll say I'm sorry honey. I was just PMSing. Now, ladies, I feel for
you. I really do. It's not an easy thing to go through., But since we already
know the outcome, I'd like to propose an experiment Fellas, the next time
your woman gets crazy., I'm gon na guess about a month from now.. I want you to
look her right in the eye and I want you to ask her Honey. Are you sure
you're not just PMSing And then grab you're gon na your balls and run for the
hills -- 
 
When? I met my lady 
And asked for her hand. 
She was the calmest 
And, the sweetest girl in all the land 
But. Then the ring went on 
And. She went all wrong. 
Like a midnight thriller. 
She went BrideZilla, 
Spat pea soup and become a killer. 
She ate three kids 
And, my auntie's wig 
And, the pastor's dog 
 
Why 
Cause. All women are crazy. 
All men are dumb 
Cause, though we know, they're crazy 
We still want some 
It's, nothing new 
And, it's sad, but true 
That. We just can't quit'em 
And. We can't live with'em 
You, just can't shoot'em 
Or you'll end in prison, 
And, the biker from Hell, 
In, your prison cell 
Might take a shine to you
