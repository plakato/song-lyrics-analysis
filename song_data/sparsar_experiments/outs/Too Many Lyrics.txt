Too Many Lyrics

Produced by Russ.

All i really got in this is me.
Everybody else just wants a piece.
Rappers disappearing off they singles.
Cuz they ain't sayin shit, them are jingles.
Only one i trust in this is Boog.
I been peepin game like who are you?
I can see thru you i got x ray.
I dont give a fuck what my ex say.

1 time 2 times too many.
I said 3 times 4 times too many.
I said 5 times 6 times too many.
You done fucked up 1 time too many yea.

Global shit.
Ceo thats my destiny.
Lotta hoes.
Lil liquor thats the recipe.
Lotta money.
On the way i'm the crystal ball.
Lotta shots.
In my holster you can get em all.
Girls from Saudi.
They be gettin rowdy.
Imma try and marry all of them if they allow me.
Thats the liquor talkin.
I just needa couple.
Im just tryna find some shit to take my mind off bein Russell.
I ain't tryna put nobody on.
Yall ain't workin hard as me thats facts.
My face card around my fam thats strong.
I dont really give a fuck about your daps.

1 time 2 times too many.
I said 3 times 4 times too many.
I said 5 times 6 times too many.
You done fucked up 1 time too many yea.

When the boss talks you should close your mouth.
We ain't got shit to really talk about.
Better keep your shit moooovvvin.
Im the reason why you doin what you doooin.
