Gone
by Russian Red.

This never ending song is scratching, scratching my brain.
Like a vinyl in desire.
This never ending thought is coming and is gone.
It's traveling on a plane on my way.

And in a highway too, as if I speak for you and I say.
That you did those things I did in the past, it's true in a truck I do.
Keep your stuff in my pocket.
Just like I did with the days we flew.

This never ending song is coming and is gone.
It's traveling on a plane on my way.

Gone, play onâ€¦
