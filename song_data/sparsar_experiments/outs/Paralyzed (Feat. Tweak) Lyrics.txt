Paralyzed (Feat. Tweak) Lyrics
by Zoetic.


I'm drinkin' whiskey out the bottle.
Devil on my caudal.
Rev the engine throttle.
To get me away.
I feel I've sunk into the bottom.
Feelin' sorrow.
Prayin' that I see tomorrow.
But these skies are gray!

I'm so paralyzed....
I can no longer move an inch....
I'm so paralyzed....
Can I break free from this grip?
I'm so paralyzed.
Like a deer in the headlights.
Hopin' to move but intoxicated by the fright, he might lose his life!

Feeling paralyzed...
Got me counting nine lives....
Cause this cats on his last leg, this could be his last day, livin' off of.
borrowed time.
Overcome this mountain climb, strugglin' to write a rhyme.
Committing all these crimes.
Might have to pull a columbine.
Cause his minds sicker than swine.
And he drowns his thoughts in wine.
Lying to his mind tells himself he's doing fine.
Stay on the grind.
Stackin' up them bucks.
Keep writin' songs, and keep pumpin' trucks.
But these days are so mundane.
Makes me wanna go insane.
And make my brain see brains.
Scattered on the windowpane.
Thats the true meaning of pain.
Its a god damn shame.
Growin' up as a believer forced to be a bottom feeder.
Just to try to make ends meet.
Hustlin' drugs in the street.
I just might get my ass beat.
See my body on the scene.
Chalked up white over that green.
I just wanna smoke some weed.
So i give into the puff smoke, now i'm flat broke.
My homies be them cutthroats that'll cut you up like fresh coke.
Always thinkin' bout money.
How to make this life more bloody.
Cause these skies is never sunny.
See these grey clouds all above me.
Somebody help me.

Starin' a whole in the floor.
Try to open all these doors.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Paralyzed i've lost control.
Movin' slow, thru meadows.
Crawl through the valley of death.
Movin' prone i try my best until i got nothin' left, yes.
No, I don't know, but i feel I gots to go.
Tryna hold on to the flow.
Somebody said reap what you sow.
Thats why i'm out here doin' shows.
Paranoia eats me up, i wish i some friends or hoes.
To the point it got me screamin'.
Is this real or am I dreamin'?
I fucked this life up so much I don't think theres a chance of redeeming.
Myself, maybe start over and just myself.

Cause a real man would use a gun.
Then there'd be no chance of not gettin' the job done.
Cause were self destructive.
Im just tryna make life productive.
But i'm oppressed by corruption.
Government funds ebol population control.
I should do the world a solid and just help it, fuck it.
