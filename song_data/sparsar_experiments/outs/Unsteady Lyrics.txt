Unsteady Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


Hold.
Hold on.
Hold on to me.
Cause I'm a little unsteady.
A little unsteady.

Mama, come here.
Approach, appear.
Daddy, I'm alone.
Cause this house don't feel like home.

If you love me, don't let go.
If you love me, don't let go.

Hold.
Hold on.
Hold on to me.
Cause I'm a little unsteady.
A little unsteady.

Mother, I know.
That you're tired of being alone.
Dad, I know you're trying.
To fight when you feel like flying.

If you love me, don't let go.
If you love me, don't let go.

Hold.
Hold on.
Hold on to me.
Cause I'm a little unsteady.
A little unsteady.
