Fairground of Illusion Lyrics
by Voice.

Welcome, welcome, welcome.
On the fairground of the illusions.
Welcome to the roller-coaster through her life.
Welcome to our market.
The market of the timeless feelings.
They rent our sunrise at the kindest price.

What now.
In what can one still believe.
How now.
One still can dream at leisure.
Who still holds his hands over us?
Close your eyes and try it once again.

Migrate with the birds above.
To hear once more the surf of the sea.
Seeing the lightning in the evening sky.
Close your eyes and then you will be free.

Welcome, welcome, welcome.
At our game show of the emotions.
Welcome to the million chance of her life.
They use the opportunity.
They are reaching for the stars.
The brightness of the moment is her price.

What now.
In what can one still believe.
How now.
One still can dream at leisure.
Who still holds his hands over us?
Close your eyes and try it once again.

Migrate with the birds above.
To hear once more the surf of the sea.
Seeing the lightning in the evening sky.
Close your eyes and then you will be free.

What now.
In what can one still believe.
How now.
One still can dream at leisure.
Who still holds his hands over us?
Close your eyes and try it once again.

Migrate with the birds above.
To hear once more the surf of the sea.
Seeing the lightning in the evening sky.
Close your eyes and then you will be free.
