You Can't Be Told it
by Swirlies.

Restless and numb.

You can't be told it.

You must behold it.

To not forget it.

Revelation.

You can't control it.

Disobeyance returns.

Learning you'll never learn.

I keep telling myself.

Do not be mortified.

By the unsolidified.

Just grin and bear it.

Learned and unlearned.

Acts of controlling.

Methods of compensation.

Methods of control.
