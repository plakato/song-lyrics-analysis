Celebrity Gossip Lyrics
by The Virus.

Have you read the papers and heard the s**t they say?
Everything I don't want to know, will we be blown away?
See, nothing really matters just who is f**king who.
Nothing that affects our lives, nothing about me or you.

Biased f**king bulls**t.
No I don't give a s**t.
Celebrity f**king Gossip.
You are full of it.
Right wing propaganda.
You give me f**king doubt.
Bleeding heart agenda.
What I f**king read about.

You sit and watch the drama as they numb your brain.
They take you f**king mind and flush it down the f**king drain.
If this is what is news then I don't give a s**t.
Just let them be clueless, just let me abort the skit.

Biased f**king bulls**t.
No I don't give a s**t.
Celebrity f**king Gossip.
You are full of it.
Right wing propaganda.
You give me f**king doubt.
Bleeding heart agenda.
What I f**king read about.
