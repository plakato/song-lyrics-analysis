King O King Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

King O King.
King O King.
King O King.
The people...a vain thing.
King O King.
King O King.
King O King.
Only Thou art devout.
He has pitched his tent.
For the brilliant son.
See him arise coming forth.
As a champion.
He does rejoice O daughter.
To run his course.
His horse...his horse!
King over the flood.
Halleluhjah the waters screem.
Bright morning star live forever.
Wear your servant as a ring.
Glory!
King O King.
King O King.
King O King.
A sound from the city.
King O King.
King O King.
King O King.
A sound from the temple.
No bird of prey knows this way.
No falcon's eye has seen it.
No lion prowls there to devour.
Proud beasts set not foot upon it.
King over the flood.
Hallelujah the waters sing.
Bright morning star live forever.
Wear your servant as a ring.
See he sits at table.
Reclined at rest with ragged lame.
King over the flood.
Hallelujah your people sing.
Bright morning star live forever.
Wear your servant as a ring.
