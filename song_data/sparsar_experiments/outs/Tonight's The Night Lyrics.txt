Tonight's The Night Lyrics
by Tyler James Williams.

The party's gone wild.
Tonight's the night.
This club is on fire.
Put up your lights.

The party's gone wild.
Tonight's the night.
Put your hands in the air.
Put up your lights.

Yeah, they call you the Bling.
But your jewels look spoiled.
Your platinum chains.
Look like aluminum foil.
Hat's too small.
Cause your head's too big.
Hair under your arms.
Like a real big wig.

Stop, quit.
Bling retire.
Your breath so bad.
That your face needs a shower.
Marathon wash.
Two or three hours.
The roof of your mouth.
Your mouth is on fire.

It's about to go down.
It's about to go down.
Put your hands in the air.
It's about to go down.

They call you the boss.
But you have no wealth.
No employees.
You should fire yourself.
And your pants so tight.
That you can barely move.
Your a bum that says.
I'll rap for food.

You're an actor dude.
With an attitude.
I'm the street's theme song.
You're an interlude.
Gonna put you on a plate.
Watch you get chewed.
They should call you a ghost.
The way you get booed!

The party's gone wild.
Tonight's the night.
This club is on fire.
Put up your lights.

Anything you can do.
I can do better.
Bring it when you want to.
I'm ready whenever.

Show me what you got, got.
I'll show you what I got, got.
Will you rise or fall?
The winner takes all!

Lights up, lights up x4.
C'mon, c'mon.
Lights up, lights up.
C'mon, c'mon.
Lights up, lights up.
C'mon, c'mon.
Lights up, lights up.
C'mon, c'mon.

I know I'm ready and able.
But still a kid bussin' all of these tables.
I can show I got what it takes.
But I already used my fifteen minute break.
I'm, working for minimum wage.
When I should be up on the stage.
Feel like I'm in the cage, I need to turn the page.
Cause the other guy's a fake, I could leave the crowd amazed.

The party's gone wild.
Tonight's the night.
This club is on fire.
Put up your lights.

I'm Bling like my watch.
So let's get it tockin'.
Your clothes full of holes.
Like your granny's ripped stockings.
Your style is old.
Not a good look.
Watch the boss get burnt.
Like the food she cooks.

Bling, I think you need a shower.
I hear you scream.
But your odor's much louder.
No, that's the sound of victory.
Now do your day job.
And get my car for me.

The party's gone wild.
Tonight's the night.
This club is on fire.
Put up your lights.
