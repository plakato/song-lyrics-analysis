Lemon Juice Lyrics
by Womanly Hips.

So-so whack kids don't know rapping.
In my homegrown dojo I flow over labyrinths.
I'll go pro mad quick, flow's so spastic.
Backflipping ad-libs drop heat like blacksmiths.
I charge heaps for that shit no free speech like fascists.
Go deeper than Atlantis preaching this magic.
Speaking enchanting, running out of breath.
So I'm breathing like fat kids.
I don't even know how this works like magnets.
Subtle rhyming undermining otherwise batshit.
Ramblings ambient off the.
handle shit.
Whose hand be in? Which cats can I travel with?
Dismantle this mantle, reach the core.
It's like eating Crust pizza, need some more.
Echoes systems, that most fear.
Put in groundwork that much is clear.

I got densely packed bars like Saturday.
Rhymes to play all day like a matinee.
So get set to stage.
an excursion.
Or I'll go interior designer and draw the curtains.
Funny how hard these actors working.
I don't stick to the script that much is certain.
Motives unquestionable, know they professional.
My multidirectional multis are impeccable.
Though I know I got the dopest flow.
Sometimes I get sick of braggadocio.
But don'tcha know this artform wasn't born from pastors.
But from trying to buy the nicest ride in the car store.

Can I wreck it? In a matter of seconds.
I gave Hannibal Lecter cannibal lectures.
Biggest animal ever plus fashionable dresser.
Seeking actual pleasure and a rational temper.
Feel, Cage'd like National Treasure.
But this, raps easy like a casual sexer.
So I'd better keep it real, boy like Pinocchio.
Flow is twisted up like a broken nose.
If minds are closed I go and open those.
Write rhymes that lemon juice won't expose.
Pay respect to those who passed before me.
Now I see my future like my past before me.
So gimme the sack or just pass the forty.
People still ask for me when I'm passing forty.
