3. Call Tha Guardz Lyrics
by X-Raided.


I lied when I said you wouldn't get smoked, 
Eyes examine the barrel as I watch you choke 
Take a deep breath cause it's your last nigga 
Got, any last words Fuck that pig pull the trigga 
And. That'S a present from me 
For helping me out the motherfucking penitentiary 
Label me insane and the dope dealer 
Now add this to your list. A cop killer. 
You can go on and on fool 
But. You won't catch the X when I match in the old school 
Like. Some peddle masked to the floor, 
And passed the hundred and flipped back to zero 
Hit 99 and I'm Southbound 
35 miles to get to Sac-Town. 
I saw a brown Monte Carlo, so I start 
To hit the sirens time to ditch this cop car 
Grabbed, the gauge off the dash 
I said Get out the car or I'm a blast. 
Nigga didn't ask no questions. 
I had a gat, so he followed my suggestions. 
Face down on the concrete 
All he saw was the streaks that I left in the street 
Now. All I need is a drink 
But. I ain't got no cash, so let me think 
Will I walk in the store, steal on and shoot the clerk 
Fuck it a beer run. That'Ll work, 
Got off the freeway on 4
