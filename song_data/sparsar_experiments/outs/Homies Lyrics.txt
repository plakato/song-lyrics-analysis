Homies Lyrics
by Antonym.

HOMIES.

What up though?
Yeah we been mobbin through the park CDM get with the lingo.
Rinding bikes low like we tryna limbo.
Bandanas up, like where'd your chin go.
Blend through the dark we the nighttime geckos.
No sound in the street you hear the bike bell echo.
Light flicker, dog might bite get bit and die sicker.
Try and wobble like a toddler to the cobblestone for your tricycle.
Colder than icicles in the snow.
Finna go, H.A.M in a minute though, Kill a foe.
For nothing, No bluffing.
Pop a cap and show my aces.
I can tell you ain't for real by your faces.
Ya'll trippin.
Get yourself a clue â€˜cus you gone fishing.
And your homies looking fishy and I wouldn't really trust em.
By the look on they grill be and my homies come and bust em.

Paris, we go hard.
We go hard.
Chilling with my homies up on that Boulevard.
Come find where I'm at homie.
We put the flag on the map homie.
Oh.. We mobbin in this bitch.
When we come through you be sobbin like tricks.
Your girl probably owes me, it's Tony Tony.
Come find me man Im chillin with my homies.

So you think you the king of Paris huh?
Well then call me a regicide.
Step aside, get smacked twice don't know your left from your right.
Looks like I picked a fight.
Every thought thought gets jot down, cock rounds.
How you like my raw sounds?
The peak of speaking speedily is peaking freakishly.
I'm not seeking enemies it's just the person you pretend to be is me.
Uh yeah.
Have your boy sweating he ain't even in the sauna.
I got him kissing all these all these piranhas.
Girls thinkin they Pre-Madonnas.
I'm just there like wow.
Theo David Luke ZiggyZang Chiddy Bang.
Couldn't cook better beats than I do.
Piru, Man I'm no Piru.
It's just Antonym.
