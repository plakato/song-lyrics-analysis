Make Me Go Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


I want you.
And I Love you but I don't want to.
I want you.
And I Love you but I don't want to.

You Make Me Go.

You Make Me Go.

You Make Me Go.

You Make Me Go.

What I thought about.
I didn't think I was insecure til you brought it out.
You're the type of girl my friends would tell me all about.
And the way you left me so cold it was like you thought it out.
Had to thaw me out I was froze.
Now.
Where do we go from now.
I made you half.
I made you half.
I thought that I made you laugh.
Member that one day.
Member that one day talkin bout one day.
I was on a one way.
You was on the sideline you ain't never loved me.
Those men could fill up the garden.
I thought you were better than that.
Well I ain't better than this, when I scream out fuck you bitch.
Might as well put that ass on wholesale.
Or craigslist.
You the type to leave before breakfast.
Wait you love me? Nah.
You bluffin.
My chicken bein' served with another man stuffin.
Fuck it, she ain't have faith in the bucket.
That hoe change men like subjects.
Why I wanna cuff it.
Why I wanna be the one looking like a goddamn fool to the public.
Trust it.

You make me go.
I want you.
And I Love you but I don't want to.
I want you.
And I Love you but I don't want to.

Why won't you go away.
