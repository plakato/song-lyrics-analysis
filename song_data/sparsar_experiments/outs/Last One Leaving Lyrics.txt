Last One Leaving Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

Cold, sweat fever, even if you don't need her 
She'll make you a believer when she comes in shaking like 
Woah- 
Won't see it coming. You won't start running 
And once she's gone and done it. You know you'll, never say 
No- 
I'm down and don't want up. 
Oh- She's here for the wrong reasons: 
Oh- I'll be the last one leaving 
Watch her work, her magic she'll leave you feeling tragic 
Have. You itching like an addict, just begging for a hit singing 
Where. Did she go- 
I'm down and don't want up 
Oh- She's here for the wrong reasons? 
Oh- I'll be the last one leaving 
Oh- She's here for the wrong reasons: 
Oh- I'll be the last one leaving 
Oh- She's here for the wrong reasons. 
Oh- I'll be the last one, leaving 
Oh- Yeah she's here for the wrong reasons: 
Oh- I'll be the last one leaving 
The last one leaving 
Yeah, I'm the last one. Leaving
