Between Your Mama and Yourself Lyrics
by A-ha.

Oh, baby, sit right down on my leg.

Hey, listen, honey.
There's something you should know.
This can't wait.
I've been meaning to tell you a long time ago.
And today's that day.

The thing is, babe.

Between your mama and yourself.
Forced to choose and without help.
With a margin you know it's true.
The one I love, well, honey, well, it's probably you.

Oh, sure, it took a little time.
I know that's true.
But this thing been preying on my mind.
Since I met you.
This I know.

Between your mama and yourself.
Forced to choose and without help.
With a margin you know it's true.
The one I love now, baby, well, it's probably you.

You've got to know.
Well, it's got to show.
Yeah, I've got to let her go.
You've got to know.
Yeah, I've got to let her go.
Oh no, no, no.

You've got to know.
Well, it's got to show.

Between your mama and yourself.
Forced to choose and without help.
With a margin you know it's true.
The one I love now, honey, baby, don't you know it's you.

Between your mama and yourself.
Forced to choose and without help.
With a margin you know it's true.
The one I love now, honey, well, baby, don't you know it's your mama, babe.
It's your mama, babe.

It's got to be you.
It's got to be you.
It's never been anyone.
