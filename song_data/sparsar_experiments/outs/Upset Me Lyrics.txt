Upset Me Lyrics
by Von Grey.


Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.
Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.

Underneath your clothes.
Underneath your skin.
Take off all your clothes.
Take off all your skin.
I wanna see you care.
I wanna see you care.

Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.
Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.

By your desire, you always find me.
Touch me, need me, bring me to my knees.
I wanna see you care.
I wanna see you care.

Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.
Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.

Underneath your arms, your skin, your night.
Lifted, I'll see you standing under the light.
Then you don't hold my stare, you take away my sight.
I wanna see you were there.

Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.
Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.

Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.
Come and upset me, come and upset me.
Come and upset me now.
