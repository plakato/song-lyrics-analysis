Mr. Jinx Lyrics
by Quarashi.

Now it's your type of mad Jinx, the mad sucker with a tail.
I've got my life worked up, it ain't as cheap as one thinks.
I've got links on it, the same internet porn.
Ain't as deep as I've been, now I've got Justin in my corner.
I creep up but they don't want me back in.
You know my love is so big.
I think my head is cracking, smacking my face.
And always giving me the baseline.
Dead in a days time.
Give back what's mine.
This ain't no rhyme about a junky on run.
Another punk with a gun.
Now when you get it, meet the mad fun.
So get on your feet and get in pack with the deal.
The beats on the wheel, now how do you feel.

It beat on your chest when I'm bouncing like yo-yo.
This story is old just like the tales I've told.
But mark my words, it will turn into gold.

Ooh, all right.
We've got it right, all right.
We've got it right, all right.
We've got it right, all right.

We dig around fanatics, tall and fallen manics.
And the planets breaking down with God the only mechanic around.
Faking firm ground, fucking up the program.
So now I'm working on my devious master plan.
It's all about these crazy comic relieves.
You know, Wooster and Jeeves and modern prophets you never believe.

We get them all on a boat.
Leave out all the rules, the white pigeons.
And sail the ship of fools.
