Down With Me Lyrics
by VNCHY.


Fly chick I could make you my chick.
Truly speaking they ain't faking when they say you run shit.

Here in my apartment, contemplating hard.
On which body part to start with.
We ain't got a future but we surely got a moment.

In this moment.
Ain't your pussy girl you owe it.

And I own it like I prepaid for it.
It's a miracle but don't forget that he prayed for it.

Told her forget about your ex man.
Focus like professor X on your next man.
Hoping to decide on the best plan.
You can take losing your Superman if Lex can.
I'm the fuck you regardless of who you with man.
Flawless if it's love, unlike autumn I ain't falling.
Lots of stress from my ex for not calling.
So I stopped scoring like a cold streak balling.
Rose garden.
You smell sweet bet that fragrance ain't cheap.
Tryna peak into your nature, hold up baby don't speak.

Leave the talking to the weak all weak.
Ive pictured your body naked now I'm tryna go deep.
Tryna go deep.
Tryna go deep.
Rock that ass to sleep.
Soon I'm gonna make a mil.
Like my first name meek.
But probably won't share it with your ass anyways.
But thats a chance you gone really have to take.
Are you down with me?

Mhmm.
I gotta ask are you down with me.

Made em all recall I'm the shit.
I ain't gotta follow this year I'm your honor this year.
Young and I'm dumb with the pen voice like I came out the pen.
And my girl like a 10.
A lot of shit I need to address y'all.
People been falling for nothing.
Guess my calling is starting to impress yall.
Guess it's starting impress.
Cartier frames to see where I'm at now.
Niggas look strange at us cuz we bout pop now.
Huh all my niggas at the top now huh.
Ain't no way we finna stop now.
Making Moves now these hoes wanna talk now.
Huh shit that was before.
Now a nigga chasing money he ain't got the time to talk now.
I gotta ask, are you down with me?

Mhmm.
I gotta ask are you down with me.
