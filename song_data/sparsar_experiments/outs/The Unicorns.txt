The Unicorns
by The Unicorns.

Tomorrow is 2014.
When I'll be 32.
And we'll be 13.
But will there be enough room for me?
Enough oxygen, for me to breathe.

Oh yeah oh yeah.

I looked in into my crystal ball.
See gummies in the sunny.
Riding moonbeams into money.
But they're the guilty phase.
Gluttony just doesn't pay.
So volunteer your journey.
It's good publicity.

Da da da da da da da.

In full force.
In full stride.
Side by side 'till 2025.

In full force.
In full stride.
Side by side 'till 2025.
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie....
