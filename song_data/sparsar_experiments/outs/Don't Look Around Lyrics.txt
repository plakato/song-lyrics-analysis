Don't Look Around Lyrics
by Volume.

MOUNTAIN cover.

Don't look around.
Cause I'm never coming back.
It's high time.
You saw the last of me.

You knew I was a wanderer.
I'd forgotten where to go.
I had no place to lay my head to rest, I had to go.

Don't look around.
Cause I'm never coming back.
It's high time.
You saw the last of me.

Whoa-oh.
She changed my mind.
You know she changed my life.

Now I'm working all day long.
I'm singing for my food.
Baby, you know that I've got everything I need.

I've given all I can.
The rest belongs to me.
Time was it didn't matter just who I had to be.

Don't look around.
Cause I'm never coming back.
It's high time.
You saw the last of me.

Whoa-oh.
She changed my mind.
You know she changed my life.

I've got another woman now.
Don't need you anymore.
Now I think I'll turn my back and walk away from you.

We're livin' in the country.
Doing everything we please.
I don't want you comin' 'round and swirlin' up a breeze.

Don't look around.
Cause I'm never coming back.
It's high time.
You saw the last of me.

Whoa-oh.
She changed my mind.
You know she changed my life.
