T.B.B. (Intro) Lyrics
by Z-Mane.


2004, that's when it all started 
That's. When I put my crown on and I went my hardest 
My team by my side, some of them stayed and some departed. 
We went through hard times, but I'll still hold it down regardless 
And. It'S too crazy. I never ever thought they'd say: I'm amazing, 
I just started out with a demo tape plugged the microphone in I'm the King
of Davis 
Only 7 years old, going on 8. I doubted anybody would hear my tape. 
I played it for my friends and my family. They had me thinking that I was
great 
9 years later, still repping for the crown R.G.O.D. better respect or get
down 
And. Even if I move to the big O-City, I'm a always represent for my town, 
Davis yeah Davis, the small lil country town, I was raised in 
Home of the Wolves you can drive through and see a bunch of country, niggas
and cows, grazing 
But. It'S all good! Any of the haters that can fall should 
Because my brothers down. Here. They stay real. We never ever claiming that
false hood 
You soft suge, sweet dreams, kiss'em good night yeah, you know what it be. 
This is the beginning, my nigga so eat your dinner, then sit back and listen. 
This is T Double-B 
 
I mean I really ain't. Gon', say nothing more 

Haha just go ahead and play that next track. 
Gon' tell them it's on haha
