Dakota Lyrics
by The Wrens.

The Dakota is down and lost off the track.
Check the directions.
You can finger us here and I'm sure we'd be there.
Sweat the directions.
It always happens.
Into the gray skies.
Has the Twins been found with rats all around.
Getting sick in the basement.
Got me there and lost with sweat pouring down.
Sorry meet your replacement.
I'm only kidding Jerry.
It always seems I'm late I had to do some errands.
I'll be there in just a bit don't wait up for me.
They're at it again just listen to them.
Running straight to mother.
I got to get it done.
We're handing it in on the second.
