1996 - lenno remix Lyrics
by The Wombats.

I had no cares in the 1990s.
I knew of no downfalls.
The war was breaking out all around me.
My concerns were with prank calls.

She kissed me on the cheek.
She kissed me on the cheek.
Right in front of the older kids.
But my self belief, my self belief.
Wasn't scarred by the modern glitch.

Cause now it feels like.
We kissed with one eye on our TV set.
And the more I give, the less I get.
Using fairground rides just to spark her smile.
This little hit to miss.
Bring back 1996.
Bring back 1996.
I want to beat those teenage kicks.
Bring back 1996.

We were cloning sheep in the 1990s.
We were building telescopes.
And sugar filled the whole of my body.
As I edged it all to grow.

I kissed her on the cheek.
I kissed her on the cheek.
Just to impress the older kids.
But my self belief, my self belief.
Wasn't lost in the modern glitch.

Cause now it feels like.
We kissed with one eye on our TV set.
And the more I give, the less I get.
Using fairground rides just to spark her smile.
This little hit to miss.
Bring back 1996.
Bring back 1996.

Stop talking, stop talking!
I need a lover, not a friend tonight.
I'm leaving, I'm leaving!
I'm not cut out for the modern life.

I'm going to beat those teenage kicks.
