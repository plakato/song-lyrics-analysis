Marlaina Kamikaze Lyrics
by The Zolas.

Oh Marlaina, you are something special.
Please believe me when I tell you so.
I'm a lion when we are one.
But without you.
I'm a kamikaze, I'm high strung.
I'm hanging up inside the hot sun.
But think about you and I'm undone.
Oh Marlaina, kamikaze life is not fun, no it's not fun.

You're like a ghost to me.
On every corner.
You're like a ghost to me.
On every man's arm.
I know you're somewhere in the city.
You're like a ghost to me.

Ran into your friends as they went to meet you.
I was a landmine they had tripped across.
I could see it in their eyes.
They could tell that I'm aâ€¦

I'm a kamikaze, I'm high strung.
I'm hanging up inside the hot sun.
But think about you and I'm undone.
Oh Marlaina, kamikaze life is not fun, no it's not fun.

You're like a ghost to me.
On every corner.
You're like a ghost to me.
On every man's arm.
I know you're somewhere in the city.
You're like a ghost to me.

I'm breaking into sweats just trying to forget.
All of those young men there to comfort you.
They work on film sets and message you online.
And I know I know I know I gotta get this off of my mind.
