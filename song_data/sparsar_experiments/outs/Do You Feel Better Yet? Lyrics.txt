Do You Feel Better Yet? Lyrics
by The Swellers.

It's been a long couple years, but I need this, too.
I miss the ringing in my ears when it didn't come from you.
No more heartstrings left to drag me down.
Do you feel better yet?

There's nothing I'd rather do than be happy.
And write a love song or two.
But they'll turn their backs on me.

Should I lie and say I'm sorry now?
Do you feel better yet?
