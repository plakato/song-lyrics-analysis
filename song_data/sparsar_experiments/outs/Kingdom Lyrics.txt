Kingdom Lyrics
by Volcanoes.

Looking into your eyes, I see diamonds and 
Champagne 
With every glance I shatter just like all the others. 
How many times must I be torn and ripped apart. 
Why can't I catch a break. 
This Cristal stare is burningâ€¦ Holes in the back of my 
Head 
 
Look. At you floating in and out of every circle, 
Flashing those crooked red lips, batting those pretty red eyes, 
Go ahead and throw back another drink, 
Your champagne eyes can't hide what is underneath
