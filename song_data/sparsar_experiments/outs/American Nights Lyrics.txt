American Nights Lyrics
by The Runaways.

Clean rock n roll.
Makes the midnight flow tonight now.
It's hot tonight.
Come on let's have a good time.
In the dark of the night.
We hunt for fun.
Chasing after the moonlight.
Hiding from the sun.

American nights.
You kids are so strange.
American nights.
You're never gonna change.

Our magic is young.
Cause we just begun.
We light up the sky.
Always on the run.
We live in the streets.
In the alleys of screams.
Cause we're the queens of noise.
The answer to your dreams.

American nights.
You kids are so strange.
American nights.
You're never gonna change.

Hey boy you're my good time.
Dance close ya feel so fine.
Hold tight we're on fire.
All night you're my desire.

Everybody.
Wanna party.
Everybody.
Wanna party.

American nights.
You kids are so strange.
American nights.
You're never gonna change.
