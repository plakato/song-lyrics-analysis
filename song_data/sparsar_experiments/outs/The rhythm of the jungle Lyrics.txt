The rhythm of the jungle Lyrics
by Quick.

Gary Numan.
Miscellaneous.
The Rhythm Of The Evening.
Love me.
I'm cheap to rent.
You could tell me.
Of when you were young.
Forgive and forget.
The rhythm of the evening.
Will tear us apart again.

Talk talk.
I only talk.
'Don't tell me lies'.
Said the tick tock man.
You're black.
You're white.
The rhythm of the evening.
Will tear you apart again.

Is this my mother?
Pieces of a picture.
But I've seen them before.
Look what.
Love's done to me.
The rhythm of the evening.
Will tear me apart again.

Let the wild.
Come in.
These boys of pleasure.
Are nothing more than faggots.
I'm not a.
Man who laughs but.
The rhythm of the evening.
Will tear them apart again.
