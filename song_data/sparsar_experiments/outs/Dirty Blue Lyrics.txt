Dirty Blue Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

This fear is only the beginning.
All for the loving hand.
Yes I smile and I agree.
It is a good night to shiver.
A good tongue might make it right.
All Ive said above a whisper.

There is a sorrow to be desired.
To be sorrows desire.

What they say is true.
It is a dirty blue.
This color around you.
Your curled up warm.
In your own little corner of Sodom.
Did you agree to believe.
This fall has no bottom.

There is a sorrow to be desired.
To be sorrows desire.

All we move by the book of numbers.
Im held together by string.
Ii hear not the voices of others.
The bells of Leuven ring.
Fear not the faces of brothers.
Ive come apart it seems.

I see not the faces are covered.
Im in your amber ring.
Your amber ring.
