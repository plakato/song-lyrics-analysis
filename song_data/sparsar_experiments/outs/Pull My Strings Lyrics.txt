Pull My Strings Lyrics
by The Virus.

It's not enough to just be you.
You must have another to dictate to.
To live the dreams that once were yours.
And through time went out the door.
Now the clock is ticking fast.
A child is born to live them out at last.
Like a sheep his mind is lead.

You f**k with my mind.
Like you f**k with a toy.
I'm no longer your little boy.
You pull my strings to watch me spin.
And in the end you'll never win.

Frustration runs through my head.
I wonder if I should be dead.
Words don't seem to mean a thing.
So what the f**k will tomorrow bring.

You f**k with my mind.
Like you f**k with a toy.
I'm no longer your little boy.
You pull my strings to watch me spin.
And in the end you'll never win.
