Sharp Lyrics
by The 3rd Kind.


I'M feeling real good right now: man 
It's close encounters of The 3rd Kind 
See, I'm a son of a gun. It'S the JaY STEEZ 
I'm, a son of a gun and a master of every trade under the Sun. 
I talk sharp, like a razor bladed under the tongue. 
Ya feel me 
, 
Huh and 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 
I'm, the BlaKK JaKK homie, such a son of a gun 
And. I mastered every trade under the Sun 
I talk sharp, like a razor blade. 
 
Let's go 
Look. 
You can't see me with the rhetoric. I be the best to spit 
Respect the regiment or fail like the rest of them. 
And hadn't, you win it 
Back. When Wayne dropped a Carter, III, 
So start beef and get washed 
And hang out like laundry 
I. Let you tumble dry, 
Cats ain't touching mine 
I always had a troubled mind 
Equipped, with some subtle lines. 
Busting rhymes couldn't touch it and bring it. 
The word play is making cats wan na crutch, for they triggers 
So. Somebody call the cops. You got. Ta semi, auto cocked 
Rocko got soul with drive like an auto shop. 
Your orthodox can't compare to my south paw 
I'm bout more. My sounds raw and sound waves. Pound floors, 
So, if you switch stance, I got quick hands. 
Jay STEEZ holds his own, like kick-stands, 
In, simple terms: I'm the illest with these written words, 

Hearse 
, 
I'm, a son of a gun. It'S the JaY-STEEZ 
I'm, a son of a gun and a master of every trade under the Sun. 
I talk sharp, like a razor blade, is under the tongue, 
 
Huh, wuh and 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 
I'm, the BlaKK JaKK homie, such a son of a gun 
And. I mastered every trade under the Sun 
I talk sharp, like a razor blade, 
Like, a razor blade, 
 
I, be The Rhymer and I'm known to rip it off. The noggin, 
Rhymes, crackle and vomiting listings, often nodded 
The brain is lost to find it off smoking cough and something 
JaKK.
