Alive In Love Lyrics
by Swift.

I never knew how great Your love could be. 
I can't believe the price You paid for me, 
You, carried all my sin upon Your shoulders. 
Now death could never take'a hold of me. 
 
I am alive in Love. 
You gave Your life to me. 
To show me the grace that my eyes couldn't see. 
I am alive in Love, 
A Love that will never die 
Jesus. Your Love is what keeps me alive. 
 
After, all that You have done for me. 
All I can do, is give You everything. 
I want to lay my life down at Your feet. Lord 
Because, You freely gave Your life to me
