Take It While It's Hot Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

It's time to jam.

Ta..ta...ta...ta..take it while it's hot.
So won't you come inside.

Take it while it's hot.
Take it while it's hot, give it all you got.
Take it while it's hot.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

I've always dreamed this was the way that it could be.
Just like a fantasy, your hear along with me.
So now it seems we've slipped into reality.
And it's plain to see this is our destiny.
Feelings I try to hold just seem to take control.
I lie awake, my body shakes with just one thought of you.
The door is open wide so won't you come inside.
And do those special things that lovers do.

Take it while it's hot, I think the time is right.
Take it while it's hot, I want your love tonight.
Give it all you got, don't let this feeling end.
Take it while it's hot, cause it may not come again.

Sometimes I'm shy but now I think that you should know.
The deeper that we go, the more my feelings show.
Time passes by just like good things come and go.
So light the candles babe, and I'll make a wish and blow.
I love the way you groove, I'm gonna make this move.
It's time to live, I wanna give you what your waiting for.
The lights are pink and low, I think we're good to go.
We're wasting time and I can't wait no more.

Come, come, come, come inside.
Come again.
Come, come, come, come inside.
Can't, can't, can't wait.
