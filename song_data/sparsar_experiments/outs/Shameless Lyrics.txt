Shameless Lyrics
by Wolfman D.

Been shameless since 
A nigga doo doo-ed his dookey drawers 
So, he ain't afraid to harass dames 
For a booty call 
Whether. They reject him. 
Or tell him to hit it raw 
Lucky for him, 
He's too ugly to catch cootey. Balls 
 
Captured, the rat pack 
Chillin in his backpack 
Takin naps before he 
Raps it up to meet the clap cat 
Scary hairy from his face 
Past his nad sack 
Even, since he had them rolls 
Of, infantile, back fat, 
 
Plays in the mud 
Covered in the Scud 
But won't get pushed by peers, 
To indulge in foamy, mugs 
He think he bullet proof 
Aloof when he's in the booth 
Yet knows he's the shit 
Like. Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poop

, 
Sho-You-Right, 
Other obsticals, be oversites, 
They, ask you! Let them know 
His prose explodes like dolemite 
Complaints of the hanus tricks, 
Can't tame, this 
Defamation of the famous 
He's too shameless 
 
Sho-You right 
You know his raps are air tight 
Known to be able to rock the mic 
To in the air tonight, 
Its a shame. 
He'S, the opposite of famous 
Wait, a minute: no, it ain't 
He's too shameless 
\, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, --, 
He plays tricks; 
Yall! Think he real, but he be jokin, yall 
You, think the water he chugged 
Was isopropanol 
Lighter to his mouth 
Still spit fire 

He stay preachin to the choir 
 
She, sweat her perm out 
Though. She know its none of her concern 
Faintin from the germs 
When. He opens his can of worms 
Fishin for insults 

Angry with the schools rules. 
So, he throw the book out. 
 
He need a look out 
Everytime. He use the portojohn 
He tips it over. 
Then escapes the scene via portal gun 
While, most people waste time, 
With, inner modacity 
This kid has the capacity 
To make his audacity. 
 
Opaque its a tragety, 
How, shame dictates life, 
Sometimes drive people 
To self-harm by the knife; 
Or beatin, their wife 
Or bullets to heads 
Of, innocent kids, 
They layin, dead, full of lead; 
 
But, not him .
