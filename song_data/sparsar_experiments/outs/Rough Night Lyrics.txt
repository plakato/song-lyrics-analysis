Rough Night Lyrics
by 57 Pixels.

It's just another rough night, I've cut me up right.
From the wrist all the way up to my forearm.
Bleeding out enough to have sore palms.
I have barely anytime before I am for sure gone.
So listen, there's some secrets that I have kept hidden.
I didn't let y'all know in fear that you could of felt sickened.
I know it appears that I'm so self-centered.
But it's the feelings of others that has kept me driven.
Accept me, Divine. Except admission.
But expect division with the next set of children.
The best bet's demolition by enhanced tech inventions.
The same oppressed repetition, we need a sess set with Sylvan.
You all know it, the severity of it is it could happen any moment.
So control it, don't posepone it.
Go to that place and beg for enrollment.
Life's like a doughnut.
You eat away the outside.
Just to get to the middle.
Of nothing like a drought's sky.
Ain't that a riddle?
Yeah, but it's something I vouch by.
And it shan't be said, can only be shout loud.
It's just another rough night, and I forgot about how.
Much of this bottle I flung on my downspout.
To wake up on someone else's couch. Now.
It's been a rough night.
And I know you'll prolly be sleeping til I come by.
To you I'm just some guy, but to me you're the one, I'm.
Wanting to be strung by, nothing like love. I'm.
Just saying, and I didn't know that you'd be frustrating.
A cunt lately, I'm goin' crazy. I just wanted you to know.
On my list of anyone, you're number one baby.
