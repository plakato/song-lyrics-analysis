Birthright Lyrics
by A-ha.

You don't want to hang around.
Said you were leaving town for the summer.
At least till sundown.
Cause time ain't going to grind you down.
Ain't going to waste your life.
Chasing rainbows like some clown.

But who's going to come with you tonight.
Who's going to tell you it's all right?
Everything changes over time.
Just like wine.

Time ain't going to hold you up.
Ain't going to make it stop.
Long enough to ease your mind.
Ain't going to make it last forever.

And you.
What you going to do?
Walk it solitary.
So unnecessary.
But it's all right.
It's your birthright.

Hey, hey, everything's different down the line.
Everything changes over time.

Time ain't going to make it worse.
It's going to make you start.
Feeling better, just like wine.
We're going to make it last forever.

And you.
What you going to do?
Just the ordinary.
So unnecessary.
But it's all right.
Yes, it's all right.
It's your birthright.

It's your birthright.
