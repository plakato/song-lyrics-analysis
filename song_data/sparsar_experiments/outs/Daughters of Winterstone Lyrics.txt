Daughters of Winterstone Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Man, stolen in the night.
Ripped right from the arms of his child.
Drain the workforce.
Torn, forced into the dark.
Working for his heart, cold and blind.
More than they can bear.

Pushed unto the edge of life.
And then further.
Pushed unto the edge of life.
Expire, replace.

Overhead the sun it shines no more.
Skies opaque with winter's squall eternal.

With faces cast in stone, emerge into the light.
We'll never return home, with ashes in our skies.

Crushed, kicked, tortured.
Quick and painless death you will not find.
Slowly, surely, purged clean.
Growing ancient, lost within the mine.
This is our home.

Imprisoned and alone, drowning in the night.
We are daughters of the stone, wandering in time.

Chained to the factory floor, smoke fills our lungs and our world.
There is no escaping this well.

Living hell.
