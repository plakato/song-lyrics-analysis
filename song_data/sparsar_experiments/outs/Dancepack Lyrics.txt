Dancepack Lyrics
by Volcano Choir.

How many trees to a west end lot?
How many smokes left have you got?
I wanna stand, but I'm talking to a cop.

There's piss on my boots, how'd ya make it stop.
The dancepack's looking for a.
crash pad spot.
I'm all loan.
I'm at the top of the pack.

Let's people, and maid to the pines.
I'll be awning that lady.
I'll be riding her line, whoa!

I'm smoking outside the Computell.

I'm already never gonna fail you.

Shaking in your clots.
And no, they are not cataloging your thoughts.

You got one kind of trouble, its the one that's on your back.

Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.
Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.
Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.
Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.
Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.
Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.

And you're shoveling shit and they pay you to talk.
My young little soul's unlearning to walk.
Clover green.
Like bravery done up like a towel sopping wet in the street.

The softening blows, the blind heights.
A warm winter coat, that's a corn rose.
The softening blows, the blind heights.
That's a cold tow through the corn rows.

Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.
Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.
Take note, there's still a hole in your heart.
Take note, and elope for the fore.
