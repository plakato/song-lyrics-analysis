Living with the Blues Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

I've been tryin' not to think about you, darling.
I've climbin' up and down on naked walls.
Knowin' what I know now makes me wonder.
How much longer can I stand before I fall.

Life has been so easy since you left.
I get up each day with nothing to do.
I've been hopin' to find a better way of living.
But it just seemed to walked out with you.

Every night I lay down I can hear.
The echoes of love in our bedroom.
And knowin' I'll never hold you again.
In your dancing shoes.
Is the hardest part of living with the blues.

I've been on a drunk just tryin' to cloud my mind.
But things don't get better 'til they do.
Guess sometimes you win nothing and sometimes you just lose.
That's just the way it is when you're living with the blues.

Every night I lay down I can hear.
The echoes of love in our bedroom.
And knowin' I'll never hold you again.
In your dancing shoes.
Is the hardest part of living with the blues.

Yeah this old line I'm walkin'.
It ain't the life I choose.
Now that's the hardest part of living with the blues.
