Say Yes Lyrics
by UNK.

{*woman moaning*}.

Baby girl all you gotta do is say yes.
Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress.
Whatever your problem might be.
Come and get with me and get it off yo' chest.
Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes.
Come get with me I'll make it worth your while.
Get in between and be trippin with a smile.
Let me make you feel so riiiiight~!

Unk.
Whassup ma, how you doin?
Twenty-fo' in the waist that's how you do it?
Rockin them Sell with the waistline low.
The kind I like that let the crack show.
I ain't never did shit but rock mic and fuck hoes.
Between me and you, the shit's gettin old.
I could see me and you, in the skrill.
Or ridin shotgun while you whippin the wheel.
Come take a trip....
Wit'cha boy Unk, I want what you want.
Don't be talkin 'bout what you don't.
Open that bottle, shots of Patron.
Let's get it on....
Fo'play my way and she bumpin my song.
Five in the morn'.
She holla one mo' round, started lickin my cone.
Y, E-S, I could take away, yo' stress.
I say Y, E-S, I could take away yo' stress.

Unk.
So whassup ma, is you down or what?
I can see it in your eyes that you ready to cut.
Meet me at the crib if you ready to cut.
The lights down low, if you stressin, for what?
If your car messed up, you can borrow one of mine.
You got credit card debt, you can borrow one of mine.
Just say yes, you can have a piece of mine.
That nigga ain't ready, I tote a Glock 9.
And then fo' sho' do'.
Blowin kush, we can do it in slow-mo.
From the front to the back if you say so.
Just don't say no cause I'm feelin yo'.
Whole vibe cause your eyes got me hypnotized.
Thick thighs, you don't wanna come and get your prize.
And that's you and me, in a life of luxury.
Say yes and that's just how it's gon' be.

Dru.
Baby girl don't liiiie to me, I know you wanna do it.
Saw the way that you were lookin when we was cruisin.
I know I ain't the type to buy you a tulip.
Give you a blunt and weed, let's get woozy.
Don't say maybe.
Cause I ain't askin you to be my lady.
Might as well say yes and you'll get a night of sex.
Rough stuff without cuffs we'll make it.
Two into one, now you beggin me.
But it's all good, just hit me up.
I reply Hell yeah~!
Tell me the truth, well shorty can you take it?
I think you can, no I know you will.
Wait and chill, I'm just bein real.
Sit back, relax.
Now tell me shorty - how do you feel?
Do you wanna be my girl.
So you wanna be my queen.
All you gotta do is agree.
But I can't promise a damn thang.
Just get down.

{*moaning at end*}.
