Downtown (Jazzy Radio Mix) Lyrics
by SWV.

Boy, I want you to listen closely to what I have to say.
Cause this is the way to my heart.

Oooh you can't stop till you find my love.
You're all that I need, mmmm.
That's the love that you've been dreaming of.
Oooh, and I like it.
Oooh you can't stop till you find my love.
You're all that I need, mmmm.
That's the love that you've been dreaming of.
Oooh, and I like it.

You've been wondering how you can make it better.
Baby, it's easy to turn my world inside out.
Your discovery will take us to another place.
Baby, on that, there is no doubt.
I've been waiting for the special moment.
Anticipating all the things you'll do to me.
Make the first step to release my emotions.
To take the road to ecstacy.

You gotta go downtown.
That's the way to my love.
Take it round and round.
Oooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love.
Go downtown,.
To taste the sweetness will be enough.
That's the love that you've been dreaming of.

Keep on doing, doing what you're doing.
'Til you feel the passion burning up inside of me.
If you do me right.
We'll be making love all through the night.
Until you uncover the mystery.
Take it nice and slow.
Baby, don't rush the feeling.
Now you know how you can make it happen, yeah.
My desire is begging for the healing.
Let me guide you down to the place to be.

You gotta go downtown.
That's the way to my love.
Take it round and round.
Oooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love.
You gott ago downlow,.
To taste the sweetness will be enough.
That's the love that you've been dreaming of.

Need - please don't miss.
You're all that I need, mmmm.
Need - please don't miss.
You can't stop till you find my love.
Need - please don't miss.
You're all that I need, mmmm.
Need - please don't miss.
You can't stop till you find my love.

That's where I keep the key to my love.
It opens up the door to so, so much more.

Baby, move on down, get closer.
To my sensitivity.
Ooh, yeah.
Baby, send me.

Downtown.
Downtown.
Downtown.
Downtown.

Go down baby go down.
Go down baby go down.
