Doctor Doctor Lyrics
by Bizarre.

Bizarre.

Maybe it's the weed...
It's more than the fucking weed.

Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me.
You better send me home.
Cause I ain't leaving till something leave with me.
Right now that's all I'm on.

Bizarre.
I've had a headache for the last three days.
And the last couple days I been missing some pay.
Do I have AIDS? I'm sniffing and coughing.
And really this doesn't happen to often.
Maybe I'm tripping, maybe I got the flu.
Maybe I'm stressed out, something I'm going through.
It's been a week and me and wife ain't have sex.
I'm usually a wild guy, I'll break her fucking neck.
I'm sick and I'm starting to wimper.
It's ninety degrees, it's like December.
My temperature is hundred and six.
I can't shit and I feel like shit.

Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me.
You better send me home.
Cause I ain't leaving till something leave with me.
Right now that's all I'm on.

Bizarre.
More trouble, here comes day two.
I took a shit in my white underroos.
My eyes look like I been smoking crack.
Exlax got me throwing up Big Macs.
Nyquil, Advil, Tylenol, synus.
Carrying my  around like I'm Linus.
Maybe it's the pork I ate in New York.
Or maybe my baby mama wanting child support.
Or maybe it's the fish that made me sick.
Or maybe it's the prostitute I let suck my dick.
Or maybe it's just the bottle of vodka.
I don't care, I just need to see the doctor.

Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me.
You better send me home.
Cause I ain't leaving till somethin' leave with me.
Right now that's all I'm on.

Obie Trice.
I'mma kill this bitch, the tip on my dick.
Ain't got an itch but I couldn't resist the switch.
She's the type of bitch made to flinch.
Walk passed niggas, all in the ass.
Or it's because I had a tall glass.
I dropped my drawers without my dick wrapped.
Purhaps, I could catch the crabs.
But, at that moment that's irrelevant.
I knew what I know now, I practice celibace.
And be hesitant from tappin' Evelyn.
Heaven sent a message when I came back negative.
Never fuck a bitch in the ass off a laxative.

Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me.
You better send me home.
Cause I ain't leavin' till somethin' leave with me.
Right now that's all I'm on.

Bizarre.
Yeah, just visiting Cincinnati.
Me and my.
I'm with my boy, Hi-Tek, down the street.
Yeah, can you take, do you take debit cards?
Food stamps?
? go get Hi-Tek out the car, man.
Tell that nigga I need some, money for the prescription.
..Kweli! Ha-ha!
