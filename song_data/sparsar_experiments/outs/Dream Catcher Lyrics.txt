Dream Catcher Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

We've been a burden though we were kept alive.
By the ones we've forsaken, by the ones at our side.
The truth we've found is out there lost in everything.
We can show the way for the wandering.

When we're young we're so naive.
It never ends unless you seek the beauty hidden underneath.
It never ends unless you seek, it never ends unless you seek.
It never ends unless you seek, you'll find out who you are.

It's easy to see.
We're running out of time.
The walls are collapsing.
They're coming down on me, coming down, coming down.
And nothing's as it seems.
This world is in ruins.
You can't believe what you see.
Don't you see, don't you see?

Don't you desire to see the truth?

This is what you wanted.
This is what you needed.
This is what you wanted.
This is what you needed.

Truth is out there, just believe.
Truth is out there, just believe.

It's easy to see.
We're running out of time.
The walls are collapsing.
They're coming down on me, coming down, coming down.
And nothing's as it seems.
This world is in ruins.
You can't believe what you see.
Don't you see, don't you see?

This world is over.
This world is over.
This world is over.
This world is over.
