Lord Knows Lyrics
by Ry.


Live behind these bars fuck you, if you try to free him, 
Another fuck you to these rappers wanting to be him 
Cause his greatness, destined on the Dawn like PM, 
I'm, going in like the wee hours of the PM 
When, I flow it's a mirage. They don't really see him 
Like, the Good Lord to a Christian 
But. They know I'm the Messiah, so they ears steady, listen, 
And. They only talk. Shit cause, my ass. They steady, kissing, 
There, go Ry, talking bout shit again, 
Obliterate laxatives ya'll still wouldn't be shit. My man 
While, I'm taking daily trips to the Colonic 

Then, had the doc cleanse me just so you can have them back 
If. You can't stomach me then lay your ho ass on your back 
And. They don't like it. When I tend to rhyme the say, word 
But how the fuck you suck at rapping when you a fucking nerd 
You, would figure that you know enough 
Flow better than me. Well them Mecca shoes, just ain't enough, 
I tend to stray away from poker. Never catch me on my bluff. 

You grew up in the hood scared to combat fisticuffs 

Section full of Piranhas. You can't swim you out of luck, 
Selling jewelry in the projects, I'm a diamond in the rough 
 
5 years ago, my granny buried 
Took. It'S toll left me colder than Ashy Larry 
And, to this day that whole memory is scary, 
Reason. I light things that give me wings like Tinkerbell the Fairy 
Throw up on the track lactose to BS, but not dairy 
As. I plan to milk this game overfilled with plenty cowards, 
But, I'm the dog just chasing tales, 
Simultaneously spit fire like Zak
