Word Is Bond Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.


I Never Fucked Anybody Over In My Life.
That Didn't Have It Comin' You Got That.
All I Have In This World Is My Balls And My Word.
And I Don't Break 'Em For No Man You Got That.

I'm Tired Of Givin' Notification.
You Waitin' For Greatness, Well How Much Attention You Payin?
When Its Right In Front Of You Lookin' You Dead In Your Eyes.
I Say M The Fuckin' Best And I Couldn't Tell You A Lie.

Collect The Thoughts From Out My Recollection.
Begin To Shed Light On Things That I Had Yet Neglected.
Shit That Makes It Hard For A Nigga To View His Own Reflection.
Sin Comes With Punishment And You Can't Be The Lone Exception.
But Through My Own Progression I Opened A Path Through Which I Will Continue.
With Intention Of It Endin' With Meetin' Jay At The Venue.
And I'm Closin' Hov'll Be Openin'.
They Say You Gotta Dream Big Well Me I'm Dreamin' Some Oprah Shit.
Gabourey Sideibee Sized Swagg And Ambition.
I'm On A Damn Mission, To Be Drivin' To The Grammy's On Manual Transmission.
The Flo's Already On Automatic No Stick-Shiftin'.
Just Put Me In Drive And I'll Be Goin' 650.
Fuck A Speed Limit I'm Autobahn With Intention.
See These Whack Niggas Gassed And I'm Trying To Lower Emissions.
Cause I Live In The OZone Flo Colder Than Frozone.
Nigga Just Might Need Prozac But The Swagg Is In The Pro Zone.
I'm No Clone The DNA Is Original.
The Ring Go Standards But The Loves Unconditional.
I Got Problems With Sympathy But How Could I Sympathize.
When My Job Is To Get On Tracks And Commit Lyrical Genocide.
Just So You Know Whack Flos Are Genetic.
Thats Partially The Reason That You And Your Bro Are Pathetic.
They Tell Me Sometimes I Go To Far.
But I Can't Break For No Bitches Can't Stop For RuPauls Nah.
No Time For Line Waitin'.
I Get On The Court Grab The Ball And Start Playin'.
Them Niggas Takin' Foul Shots But Incosistent, Non Payton.
I'm Nash At The Line 90% For Y'all Haters.
I'm Clutch Then A Mother Fucker No Lebron James'n.
I Spin 'Em Off The Backboard Give 'Em A Little English, Chuck.
My Whole Game Is Liu Kang And Bruce Wayne With Two Chains.
And Two Dames And Two Sets That Dude Claim.
Thats Cieling Fan Swagg Gang, 300 Spartan Squad.
Compared To That Y'all Lookin' More Tiny Than Nate Archibald.
An All-Star You Wonder Why The Ain't Startin' Y'all.
But Remember Jason Terry You Ain't Gotta Start To Ball.
You Just Gotta Ball To Start, Like Mike.
Nigga Had All The Heart Ended Up In The Sky.
Had A Dream And Kept On Holdin' On.
And Mines Gon' Be Reality, My Word Is Bond.
