Blame It On Tupelo Lyrics
by The Union.

From the jaws of disaster, you get another shot.
Guess the wheels keep turning, 'till you say they're not.
Squeeze sparks out of his head.
Wringing new colours from the blues.
It's no big deal, it's what we do.
When the sun goes down I'll know.
Until then I'll just believe.
While I'm chasing dreams I can't let go.
I'll blame Tupelo.
A handshake, a cold beer.
And then a lot of luck.
I could do with the money but I don't really give a fuck.
I fell in love with a feeling.
The best kind of high.
Every day I've gotta get it back.
Don't ask me why.
When the world spins out of my control.
It doesn't really bother me.
Every day I play this role.
Guess that's the way it's got to be.
I'll blame Tupelo.

When the Sun goes down I'll know.
Until then I'll just believe.
While I'm chasing dreams I can't let go.
I guess that's the way it's got to be.
I guess that's the way it's got to be.
I'll blame Tupelo.
I'll blame Tupelo.
I'll blame Tupelo.
I'll blame Tupelo.
