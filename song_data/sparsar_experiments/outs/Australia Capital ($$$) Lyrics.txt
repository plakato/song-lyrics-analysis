Australia Capital ($$$) Lyrics
by Yung Neptune (AKA YUNG JZ7).

Talking to the daughter of a famous actor.
She married and i shouldn't bother.
But my charisma get ahead of me.
Woke up with her in bed with me.
And now she tryna be tellin me.
What i did was wrong.
Like i was the two timer skeezin or slackin jackin me off.

I look at her deeply I say.

Baby you smile a lot.
And you have a nice ring.
I wish I could take it off.

You see me in class.
You see me on stage.
But that's not enough.
I'm clearly buildin up some rage.

Past this aggression.
Our relationship expression.
Besides what i hide and besides what i need.
Drop the ring drop my clothes fuck the classics.

I want you to see me.
