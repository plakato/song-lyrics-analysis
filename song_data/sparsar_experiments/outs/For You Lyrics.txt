For You Lyrics
by Wolf Rider.

Threw away my travelin' bags for you.
No longer do I miss my past, for you.
What's the difference if it's all for you?
If I'm just throwing away myself for you?

I laid it all out on the line for you.
And left my baggage all behind for you.
Still I'm burnin' up inside for you.
But I won't go without a fight for you.

Ohh oh oh oh oh oh oh I would've given anything for you.
But anything just won't do.
And that place I keep runnin' to.
Is like a glass house with no views.

Ohh oh oh oh oh oh oh You.
I've been up, I've been down.
I've been everywhere around.
For You.

Threw away my travelin' my bags for you.
No longer do I miss my past for you.
What's the difference if it's all for you.
If I'm just throwing away myself for you.

Ohh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
