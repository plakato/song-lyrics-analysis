Colors Lyrics
by Yuna.


I'm lying on the floor.
I'm drowning from the storm you made.
We both know it's difficult.
Nobody said we'll get hurt this way.

Don't say that I don't have to stay here any longer.
Who are you to tell me what I don't deserve?

You need to listen when I say.
I just want you.
Hold on don't let it slip away.
I just want you.

Know that I can't go on another day.
Don't let all the colors fade away.

Love was something that.
I thought I'd figure out on my own.
An empty space my armour crumped is all I see went you're gone.
You say all the things.

That I don't want to hear.
But silence it not what I want either.
