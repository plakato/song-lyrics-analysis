Redneck Crazy Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Gonna drive like hell through your neighbourhood.
Park this Silverado on your front lawn.
Crank up a little Hank.
Sit on the hood and drink.
I'm about to get my pissed off on.

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows.
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows.
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight.
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby.
And drove me redneck crazy.

Wish I knew how long it's been going on.
How long you've been getting some on the side.
Nah, he can't amount to much by the look of that little truck.
Well, he won't be getting any sleep tonight.

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows.
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows.
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight.
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby.
And drove me redneck crazy.
Redneck crazy.

Did you think I'd wish you both the best.
Endless love and happiness?
You know that's just not the kind of man I am.
Yeah, I'm the kind that shows up at your house at 3 A.M.

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows.
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows.
I didn't come here to start a fight.
But I'm up for anything tonight.
You've gone and broke the wrong heart, baby.
And drove me redneck crazy.
You drove me redneck crazy, oh, yeah.
