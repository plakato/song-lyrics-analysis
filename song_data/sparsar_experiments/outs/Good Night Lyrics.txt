Good Night Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Good night, good night.
Good night, good night.
Good night, good night.

Good night, to the northern winters.
And the heartless sinners.
I haven't seen you now for a while.
But you have burnt yourself in my mind.

Good night, to the workers on compressed.
And the equally depressed.
I haven't seen you now for a while.
But you have burned yourself in my mind.

Plug the radiator in the car.
I can see the words you're screaming in the frost.
Rush into the woods where we first felt God.
It rippled through our veins from the moment when we touched.
The city's love is cold and the city's love is hard.
It locks into our veins from the first September's frost.
And someday if you get it together in your heart.
Maybe we might get back together but....

Good night, to the Alberta advantage.
I'm leaving just like we planned it.
And you can still escape with your life.
Cause i have just escaped with my life.

Good night, to the five-two-then-sex-ers.
Please look after my sister.
Let her know that i missed her tonight.
And I miss her more with time.

The city's love is cold and the city's love is hard.
It locks into our veins from the first September's frost.
The January's snap and April winter thaw.
The rough and tumble summers underneath the midnight sun.
Let's rush into the woods where we first felt God.
It rippled through our veins from the moment when we touched.
And someday if you get it together in your heart.
Maybe we might get back together but....

Good night, good night.
Good night, good night.
Good night, good night.
