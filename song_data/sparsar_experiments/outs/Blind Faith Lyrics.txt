Blind Faith Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.


I'Ve been the distance and I've seen it all. 
I'Ve been turned around by love and hate 
I have resided in my private hell 
But. I love this life and I live to tell 
 
Blind Faith is the cause of the trouble 
Blind faith. What we bleed, 
 
When, I was young, I didn't realize 
There - was hope and fear with no compromise 
And. Now I testify before myself. 
I keep walking on in my innocence, 
 
I know. If you follow me-, you get. What want you get? What you need 
Somebody's got to set you free-, you get. What want you get, what you need 
Now, don't you give it and learn to breathe. 
You hear a message now before you leave 
You know the fortune here that you have found 
There ain't, no doubt about it. There ain't no doubt about it
