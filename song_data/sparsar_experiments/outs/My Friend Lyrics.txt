My Friend Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man 
Ooh aw yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, 
Ooh, baby, aw yeah, oh 
I, never wan na see you girl, my friend 
 
A year ago in school is where 
It all began. 
I walk you to the bus, stop like everyday 
And after then, we'd meet again. I'D feel OK, 
It came as a surprise. 
You were like one of the guys 
Going to the crew 
Then. One day you came to me 
 
And, I'm with you unhappy 
But. What should I do 
How? Can I tell you 
 
3rd Storee 
1- I've been holding back so long 
Thinking. What I feel is wrong. 
Can'T believe I feel in love. 
With such a friend of mine, 
You, are everything to me. 
It'S, a shame. I couldn't see 
All the feelings rearranging 
Right before my eyes: 
 
Lil'Man 
I, don't wan na, take the risk of losing you 
And. If I have to keep it to myself 
That's what I'll do 
I get butterflies. When I see you staring my way, 
Writing letters to myself to think of what to say, 
It's a feeling I can't hide 
It's destroying me inside 
My life is gone all week. Â€˜Cause. I can't get no sleep 
And. The way I look at you, 
Has got to catch the clues 
And, it's all to see 
How. You will respond to me. 
 
D-Smoove 
Hey. What'S up Shanelle 
 
Hey uh, can you keep a secret 
Cool? Well, uh, you know Lil'Man 
Got, a big crush on you and all that 
 Yeah 
 
Oh for real. Well, let me go tell him then
