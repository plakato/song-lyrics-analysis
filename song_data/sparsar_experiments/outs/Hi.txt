Hi
by Punsy.


Do this for the money.. I do this for the love see
I just want name in public'til. It spreads to different countries
Highly doubt that day is coming.. I just want someone to bump me
In their stereo. It'S scary, though This music thing is, ugly
The, scenarios can vary. So it's usually a luck. Thing
It must be because these cats, I hear, are sucky
Teaching little kids to dougie way before they learn to study
Sorry, if I'm sounding fussy, but this kinda stuff just bugs me
All. These tracks are made by dummies who are rich and living comfy
Making songs about NOTHING Guns, weed, luxury
Jump, weak punks, drink, run, streets, sluts, skeet., DUMB THINGS, 
, ..., I'll, try to say this humbly. None of them can touch me
They're, all wack and clumsy.. None of them match my cunning
 .... They make up lies in their raps and it's so disgusting
Yo. I can conceive original tracks with no cussing
Dudes taking months to write just to rap to one beat
But. I can complete a full album in less than one week
…It's just so funny because nobody's hungry
There's, no rumbles in the tummies. they're, just fronting for the funding
It's, not making any sense like jumping cliffs without a bungie
I. Don'T do it for the chips I just wan na say it. Bluntly
I, don't really give a damn. If a record label wants me
DTF is my company and I'm thankful cuz. They trust me

 ... Hi. My name is Punsy
 .... I just want you all to love me
 ... Hi. My name is Punsy
I'm. Just asking you to listen cuz. I know that y'all
Will love, me
, ... hi. My name is Punsy
I'd just hate for all this effort to be nothing
, ... Bye. My name is punsy
I. Do this? For respect., That's the summary…
