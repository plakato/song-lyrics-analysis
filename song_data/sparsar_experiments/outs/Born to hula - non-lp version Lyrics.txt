Born to hula - non-lp version Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.

Follow trails of you to here.
Every mile takes you my way.
Rolling faster if we can.
Roll.
Tables turnin' all the time.
I'm the dog at your feet.
Out of sight, out of time.
Yours.
You're the one.
You're the one.
You're the one.
You're the one.
Colored bottles in a line.
Different signals blinkin' my way.
Rolling faster all the while.
You're the one.
You're the one.
You're the one.
You're the one.
Ain't it something, I'm born to hula.
Ain't it something, I'm born to hula.
Ain't it something, I'm born to hula.
Ain't it something, I'm born to hula.
