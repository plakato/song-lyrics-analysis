Big Willie Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

Run One two, one two...
DMC And this is, the hardcore raw.
Lyrical law, never seen before.
And I am, D.M.C...
And for all of y'all.
This is the way, we reckless for rhymes.

Run.
You got to save it for David and wave it if you think that I gave it.
I never gave a damn about a critic so save it.
I run amuk demanding my opinion you make it.
The critic'll get the didick and if you got it then stay with it.
You never knew me but you flew me to your town see.
By kickin dollars straight to Hollis I'm off the ground B.
I never heard of such where niggas stand and I fell.
I'm doin years with this career like Patti La-Belle.
And if I ever was to fall I fell upon ya.
Like ?? I made my mind I come to con ya.
I see females I tell them yo my word is bond huh.
Like Terri Teresa Tammi Tawana Tarena and Tonya.
I'm comin hard I got your head and yeah the lock's on.
I threw you up, why did your daddy ?? cock strong.
I rock I wreck I rip a rhyme I ??
My rap is right I write a rip-and-ready rock song.

D.M.C..
Call on the brother to come and get dumb.
Until the def drum come as they come, when they come.
I said I rip some, tearin them up, a big up.
A whattup? A nigga, a so what, yeah put your bricks up.
I knock down the walls because I got to.
The rock sound because I hip-hop new.
Not the old, gold, from around the neck.
And when I grab ahold you give me nuff respect.
In a black BM, with my contact lens.
When the track begins, I'm setting new rap trends.
Lettin lyrics I lay down.
You play loud I stay proud with Jay down you stay down.
Get up on the truck song, the one you put your buck on.
You're stuck on, you're luck on, you're sucked on.
A lollipop SUCKA.
I snuck ya, I struck ya, you stupid mother...

Run.
I gotta come my name is Run and me and D we been appointed.
I'm ever so clever you never TOUCH the annointed.
I'm Born Again I got a friend the Lord I rearrange.
But other than that I'm livin fat and ain't NUTHIN changed.
Big Willie still in your grilly, you better block son.
I bust you up and then I blast you with my Bop Gun.
A million times rhyme risin to the prime.
While another nigga's cuts get bucks, like it's a dope rhyme.
Be instead I'd rather leave another brother dead.
Cause yet another brother deaded from the slow dread.
I'm makin papers, brothers catchin vapors.
Try to lick shot, you get got, catch you later.
This ain't The Cosby Show you know what it's like A Different World.
We're livin inside a world where you get the cash, you hit the girl.
So check the hypness, I'm not livin like this.
I'm the type of guy to bust your eye, you lose your whiteness.
You comin butt when you wish upon a star.
But I could never be butt, so yo, bust the guitar!

.. *guitar and scratches* ...

D.M.C..
Heads up my brother, here comes another.
Word to the verb the urge to discover.
A lover, you hover, you smother, my brother.
You can't do nothin other than take the record out the cover.
You get the song at it's strong and randomn flow.
You sing along cause the words you heard you know.
Hostyle the style that style is wild.
The penile is where I goes and smile.
Because I pop a lot, they try to lock me up.
Because I rock the block, they try to stop me up.
But I'm sly as a fox I can rocks.
I got smarts when they starts tradin shots they get dropped.
I pull my card I pull my card I pull my card NOT.
I use the rock to be hard, I'm a hard rock.
You get a speedknot, and then you bleed a lot.
You better read a lot because you really need a lot of.
Information, and some education.
Cause I'm replacin what you hearin on your station.
Darryl is a Mack, Joe is in the Public.
Jason leads the nation and I know you're gonna love it, Jay!!
