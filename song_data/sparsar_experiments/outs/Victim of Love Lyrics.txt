Victim of Love Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

No, I can't believe that it's true.
After all we've been through.
You say that there's somebody new.
Hey, what did you feel when we kissed.
Tell me, was there something that I missed.
Never thought it would end up like this.

So goodbye, baby say goodbye.
I know it won't be easy.
Cause you need me.
A victim of love.

And I don't know what I'm to do.

They say all is fair in love.
But sometimes enough is enough.
Losing at love is so rough.
Hey, they said you were my friend.
That true love is without an end.
Tell me, do broken hearts ever mend.

This is the last time.
I'll never hurt again.

Say goodbye bye boy.

Victim of love.
Stop.

Better say goodbye.
Say goodbye.
I'll never hurt again.
Whoa, a victim of love.
I don't know what to do.

Goodbye, baby say goodbye.
I know it won't be easy.
Cause you need me.
I was a victim of love.
And I'll never hurt again.
Victim of love.

I thought that you and I were different.
The way you made me feel.
In your arms, the sweet words you whisper.
Seem to be so real.
But now it's time to turn and walk away.
Sometimes dreams come true.
But not for me my love.
But maybe for you.

Goodbye.
