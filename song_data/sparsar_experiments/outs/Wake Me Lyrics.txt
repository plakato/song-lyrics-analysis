Wake Me Lyrics
by Rusty.

It used to be kind of fun.
But now it is not.
And ohh.
I'm tired.
I used to once have the world.
But now I do not.
And ohh.
I'm tired, so tired.
And if I run away.
Won't you chase me up.
And if I fall asleep.
Won't you wake me up.
Won't you pull my cuff.
Now freedom comes at a cost.
That I don't want to pay.
And ohh.
I'm tired.
I know I said I would leave.
But I'm still here today.
And ohh.
I'm tired, so tired.
And if I run away.
Won't you chase me up.
And if I fall asleep.
Won't you wake me up.
Won't you pull my cuff.
And if I fall asleep.
Won't you wake me up.
Won't you pull my cuff.
Well I've got some plans.
That you might just still want to change.
And ohh.
I'm tired.
Well I've got some friends.
That you might just still think are strange.
And ohh.
I'm tired, so tired.
And if I run away.
Won't you chase me up.
And if I fall asleep.
Won't you wake me up.
Won't you pull my cuff.
And if I run away.
Won't you chase me up.
And if I....
