Life's Around Lyrics
by Unique B..

This is for my homey, Joey.
He's one of the dudes that'll never leave me lonely.
Imagine when I get higher up.
Ain't no shootin star, but I sure will fire up.
And I'm like a black hole.
Stuck inside nowhere to go.
You can forget what I say.
But don't forget what I mean cuz that ain't right.
And I am so out of sight.
Rapper by day. Pixie Stix Addict by night.
Rap. Eat. Daydream.
None of you understand or really know what I mean.
Dropped from my spaceship at night.
Time zone's fucked up, so fuck sleeping right.
Insomniac looking for new recruits.
Stay up all night. Do what insomniacs do.
A quick fix of pixie stix and root beer.
Talk to me now. I don't care who hears.
And text is overrated. I hate it.
What's been said to me by the ladies.
My ego, that's not my problem.
But if you see one, go on then and solve it.
And if I don't reply when you're talking.
Sorry, but my attention channel has me falta.
Me falta what?
Can't believe this dude went spanish on us.
Yo. Shoulda finished a bar ago.
But my martian flow is spillin outta my brain.
All over the floor.
I want more.
Attention.
From little dudes to old people with the pensions.
No pervert, so don't go missin.
I hate how topics in my songs keep switchin.
Must have ADD.
Cuz if I ain't on one thing, it ain't on me.
I'm still up while yall still down.
Dropped from the sky, yall grow from the ground yeahh.
I'mma rise up one dayy.
Higher Up yeah that's me.
