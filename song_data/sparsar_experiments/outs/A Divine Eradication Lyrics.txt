A Divine Eradication Lyrics
by Underoath.

Between motionless and this retched state of digression.
Treading on the line that I drew from my own compliance.
Let me feel it rain down.
I cannot wait any longer.
Let's get something straight.
I am not, no I am not who you made me out to be.

It's the awakening of my body's inner consciousness.
The fraction of my sleepless, numb existence.

Rain down now, on me.
Rain down now, on me.

Pick and pull apart my limbs.
Push me down now from your throne.
Oh, I feel it now.
Drag me down now to the floor.
Press the point into my skin.
Oh, I feel it now.
Oh, I feel it now.

Something will have to collide.
To end the constant spinning of cycles strung together.
And I'm crawling in the streets.
Where is my fix.
Where is my fix.
Where is my fix.
Where is my....

I stand alone in time.
I stand alone in time.
I stand alone in time.
I stand alone in time.

When they spun away, I fell apart.
When they spun away, I fell apart.
