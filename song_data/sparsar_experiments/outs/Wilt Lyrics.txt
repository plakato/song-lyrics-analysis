Wilt Lyrics
by Rune.

Withering away, ... 
The colors fade into one 
The. Turning of the tides 
To pass from old to new 
Kneeling before the sun, 
And seeking forgiveness, 
No shelter from these piercing rays, 
That blister my skin 
Scarring, the flesh, 
 
Begging for night- for an end 
To, the suffering 
Covering, the sun 
In a darkened embrace 
Unable to Crawl of from these depths, 
I have sank: 
 
Intentions, grow weak- 
Ambitions begin to fade 
Searching for closure, 
 
Within the reach of another existence 
One day. This nightmare will end 
Leaving this life's perils behind 
Withering away
