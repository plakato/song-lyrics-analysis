Baby Daddy Lyrics
by Queen Pen.


I shouldn't loved him.
I shouldn't wanted him.
I shouldn't trust him.
No I shouldn't fucked him.
Now here I am carryin his seed.
That makes two for him and a fourth for me.

Sometimes I'm wreckin my brain, tryna to figure out.
How we can come to this, how we even came about.
We never took the time to measure the proper amounts.
Or beef we would cause of sneakin around.
If my brother even knew shit he'd proably flip out.
And up until tonight we never had doubts.
Remeber the first time that you slept over my house?
We made love to Donnell Jones, damn we so foul.
But now its been a year from that day today.
We still meet in the cut I can't live this way.
Can't be no more us, fuck you feelin lame.
What about me feelin loved, is sex all that its worth?
When it comes to us, I know that you love me.
Its deeper then a nut, I know that you care for me.
Its deeper then a nut.

You keep blamin it on him clamin him as a friend.
Talkin about you and that nigga is tight like brothers.
Fuck him, and I can put that on my life.
So what he my baby daddy he don't do his child right.
Tryna to explain I got tears in my eyes.
This lump in my throat tryna hold back my cries.
You talkin about me and ya booze ain't wise.
Me and you has a cup Queen it just ain't right.
You said it could never be yo niggas B.D. a wife.
Tell me how would it look to the rest of my crew.
You fuckin wit me Queen thats just bad news.
I'm breakin rules but we just can't stop.
I said we in too deep I'm not killin ya seed.
I say we in too deep nigga I'm keepin my seed.

It really broke my heart to see you pushin that whip.
When you couldn't even cop a new coat for yo kid.
It really broke my heart when you cocked backed on me.
When I was six months pregnant still beatin on me.
It really fucked me up how you put me in debt.
Fuckin up QPs dollars and sense.
To think I catch your doughs and your whiz in my crib.
Jeporadize a lively hood on me and my kids.
And which one of those seeds belong to you.
God would've been better of makin a cat or a baboon instead of you.
Nigga I mean you ain't worth shit.
A man that don't take care of his kids ain't worth lint.
Now here I am I'm in love wit yo friend.
And the only thing standin in the way is you bitch!
I cursed the day I ever even accepted your dick.
Your daughters father don't know you.
Tell her yo father is yo friend, bitch.
