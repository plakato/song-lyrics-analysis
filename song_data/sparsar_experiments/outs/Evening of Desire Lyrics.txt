Evening of Desire Lyrics
by The Undead.


You give me love.
You me everything you can.
You give me love.
You make me feel like I'm a man.
All night kisses set me on fire.
You're guaranteed to bring an evening of desire.
Look at you girl.
Down on your knees.
Your tender, loving lips.
My slave, you're bound to please.
You are my victim.
I am your sire.
We'll share our fantasies an evening of desire.
Evening of desire.
Delight in your screams.
You're the girl of my dreams.
Evening of desire.
Delight in your screams.
You're the girl of my dreams.
Evening of desire.
Desire.
Now you are powerless.
Satisfaction bound.
And you are speechless.
You will not make a sound.
You chest is heaving.
You're getting scared.
I'll take you higher on an evening of desire.
Evening of desire.
Delight in your screams.
You're the girl of my dreams.
Evening of desire.
Delight in your screams.
You're the girl of my dreams.
Evening of desire.
Desire.
Now you are powerless.
Satisfaction bound.
And you are speechless.
You will not make a sound.
You chest is heaving.
You're getting scared.
I'll take you higher on an evening of desire.
Evening of desire.
Delight in your screams.
You're the girl of my dreams.
Evening of desire.
Delight in your screams.
You're the girl of my dreams.
Evening of desire.
Desire.
