Kill Wave Lyrics
by Yung Gleesh.

Yung Gleesh.
Kill, on my kill wave.
I've been trappin for.
I've been trappin for.
I've been trappin for.

I've been trappin for a very long time.
But I never ever ever seen a bitch like this.
Never ever ever seen a brick like this.
Never ever ever seen a shit like this.

I've been out here trappin for a very long time.
But I've never seen a bitch like this.
Never ever ever seen a brick like this.
Never ever ever seen some shit like this.

Drinking lean, drinking liquor, poppin pills.
Working with the work I working with some deals.
Get a lot of love when I stack up.
Well nobody was there when I was fucked up.

New bently-cruz so nigga put your truck up.
New lexus truck so nigga put the bus up.
If any nigga don't fuck with us they fucked up.
The new infiniti truck so put your bucks up.

?
Fuck and working with the work.
30 dial on the wrist and purp.
4 grams, I hit you first.
Extra grams and get your ?

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Kill Wave.

I've been trappin for a very long time.
But I never ever ever seen a bitch like this.
Never ever ever seen a brick like this.
Never ever ever seen a shit like this.

I've been out here trappin for a very long time.
But I've never seen a bitch like this.
Never ever ever seen a brick like this.
Never ever ever seen some shit like this.

MPA Shitro.
You ain't never seen remix so clean.
Fishscale shawty 100 bandz in my jeans.
Nigga tried to rob me, he get hit with the beam.
I old school trappin juggin off a triple beam.
She ain't neva fucked a nigga like shit.
She ain't neva been to the bonuses.
Baby girl I got the keys to my city.
I pouring fours, and that shit bad for my kidney.

I'm the type of nigga neva gave a fuck.
Pull up on your block broad day and let it bust.
You ain't never seen a nigga finesse you out your bricks.
Taking all your cash and get to smashin on your bitch.

Yung Gleesh.
I've been trappin for a very long time.
But I never ever ever seen a bitch like this.
Never ever ever seen a brick like this.
Never ever ever seen a shit like this.

I've been out here trappin for a very long time.
But I've never seen a bitch like this.
Never ever ever seen a brick like this.
Never ever ever seen some shit like this.
