Enemies Lyrics
by The Wolf Pack.

6F.
When I step in.
I come in wrecking.
Investing.
I put the best in.
No competitor.
Better.
No equal.
When i go evil.
No people.
Could be my sequel.
No enemies ever hold me.
Im real and they only phony.
Never really could know me.
I'm owning killing their homies.
You think you moving then show me.
Im holding the keys.
Im running ths streets.
You running from me.
You barely could breathe.
Exploding in motion.
While im shaking the ocean.
These fakers were hoping.
That we never would notice.
We know this.
And flow the coldest.
They never ever could hold us.
Im burning down the opponents.
So nothing ever survives.
So every part of em dies.
Im wrecking they lives.
Every time i come on the mic.
Im ending this war tonight.
I swore its never a fight.
I'm the force thats holdin the night.

Lord, protect my enemies from me.
They never know who they're messing with.
They don't know who is coming.
Lord, protect my enemies from me.
They never know who they're messing with.
They don't know who is coming.

Mr. Volk.
Es ist der Deutsche, der rappt.
Auch wenn's hier keiner checkt.
Bring' ich lines, die euch ueberwaeltigen.
Bring' ich lines, die euch vergewaltigen.

Ich lege die Waffe in deinen Mund.
Gebe dir den Befehl und.
Du drueckst ab, machst dich platt.
Ich schau mich noch ne stunde an dir satt.

Der Pfarrer sagt er ruhe in Frieden.
Aber den werde ich dir ganz sicher nicht geben.
Ich folge dir in die ewigen Jagdgruende.
Ich suche dich dort, bis ich dich finde.

Als du mich siehst, versuchst du zu rennen.
Aber du lernst meine dunkle Seite kennen.
Du faellst um nach nur einem Schlag.
Hast du ueberhaupt Ehre ist, was ich mich frag.

Ich zieh' dir alle Zaehne, wie dein Zahnarzt.
Denn heute ist dein grosser Zahltag.
Binde dich an einen Baum, wie einen Bastard.
Was ich tue ist nur eine Gnadentat.

Selbst im Leben nach dem Tod hast du keine Ruhe vor mir.
Mein Messer glaenzt ganz rot, fuer eine Weile steckt es in dir.
Langsam zieh ich es raus.
Mit dir ist es aus.

Lord, protect my enemies from me.
They never know who they're messing with.
They don't know who is coming.
Lord, protect my enemies from me.
They never know who they're messing with.
They don't know who is coming.

Focus Tha Rapper.
My crew is finally popping off.
Like fireworks in parking lots.
I meet a girl thats kind of raw.
My cock is screaming top me off.
I'm the king of monster monologues.
Reincarnation of Kirk's captain logs.
I meet a crew thats kind of soft.
Their heads are screaming chop me off.
I'm smoking on the ??? ???
Open up a window.

This is payback for the ones that called us crazy mental.
Cause we made our own beats and flowed on instrumentals.
Now we back up at your front door and its sentimental.
Got you crying hoping don't kill you with innuendos.
Like menopause off the blood flow of the menstrual cycle.
We turn the knife slow.
And watch the stain grow.

Lord, protect my enemies from me.
They never know who they're messing with.
They don't know who is coming.
Lord, protect my enemies from me.
They never know who they're messing with.
They don't know who is coming.

J. Wrock.
Wanna know my favorite pastime?
Killing niggas and taking dimes.
Only have to say one line.
All the chicks in the room are mine.
Your left dry call it aparthied.
And now your salty oh my.
And yes im twisted.
Like your neck in a minute.
If you don't get out my buisness.
You know im trying to get it.
If you get it my way.
Lead shower for you and your homies.
And you know i like to spray.
Like ratchets in a hallway.
And if you dont like my ways.
We can take it outside okay.
And ill chop off your limbs.
And send em to your kids at christmas.
Wanna know why ?
Because i saw daddy on their wish list.
Yes boy I'm viscious.
I'm a man of war.
If you try to battle me It'll turn into a horrocore.
Yeah boy I'm hardcore.
Meet you in that abby.
Cut out your tongue since you keep talking bout me.
Blood stains on the concrete, gunshots on the wall.
And you know I'm victorious because I'm the one thats standing tall.

Lord, protect my enemies from me.
They don't know who they're messing with.
They don't know who is coming.
Lord, protect my enemies from me.
They never know who they're messing with.
They don't know who is coming.
