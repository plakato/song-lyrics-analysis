Music Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


As far back as I recall.
You've played a major part.
Inspired me to see my place in life.
You give me reason to create.

Everyday is brand new.

And you've touched me in those places.
That no one but you can reach.

You take me to this high.
I feel like I can fly.
The melodies you send me.

The music of my heart.
The music of my mind.
The music of my soul.
The music in me.

And here I am at this place.
I've tried to get to all my life.
Where I can give you all my love so much.
Where many people we can touch.

I won't disappoint you.
Show me the world.
I'll go with you.
No limitations to our journey.
Please help me be all I can be.

I've been in love with you.
With you all my life.
Through everything.
It's been just you and I.

You know my thoughts.
What is deep inside.
You allow me to interpret them through you.
