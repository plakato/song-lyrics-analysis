Angels Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


On wings of dreams descending from high.
Many lights of fire are filling our court of gold.
Gloria.
White brilliance dawns a permanent day.
There are never tears, and the planets.
They ring with joy.
In excelsis.

Fall down in awe, who sees the sun rise?
Wonders of this world.
Can never be understood.
Modo sentitur.
The stars above join in with our host.
Sing of perfect light.
Their voices will never cease.
Te: et ecce.

Hear the voices all around us.
Every one is a star, let it ground us.
Words of fire, leave the tongue and heart.
Take it higher, setting them apart.
Music of the spheres, burning any fears.
At the dawn of an era, that is drawing near.
Rock of ages, in a stormy sea.
Set me in the stars, let forever be.
