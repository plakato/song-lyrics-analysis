I Can Have Everything Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


My momma told me i can have everything.
So i started from the bottom, never surmounted to anything.
Then one day i caught sight of one thing.
My mind telling me I Can Have Everything!
Yeah,yeah i can have everything.
Now Im at the top, now i got everything.
Yeah,yeah i can have everything.
Now look at me now, i have everything.

I pass the money to my niggas like a dub of reefer.
Now i'm aiming at your windows,glass cleaner.
I gotta girl no eater, i just freak her.
Getting my job done so i can leave her.
I got billions in my bank,man i don't need her.
But if i get a kid, i will never leaver her.
Gotta raise my kid to be something, won't ever ease up.

My momma told me i can have everything.
So i started from the bottom, never surmounted to anything.
Then one day i caught sight of one thing.
My mind telling me I Can Have Everything!
Yeah,yeah i can have everything.
Now Im at the top, now i got everything.
Yeah,yeah i can have everything.
Now look at me now, i have everything.
