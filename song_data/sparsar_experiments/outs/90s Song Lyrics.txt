90s Song Lyrics
by WordPlay T.JAY.


T-Dot'S Back T-Dot's Back 
You can gone. Tell them haters not to be like that. 
 
I met this girl named Tammy. She stay out in Miami 
She, say it's hot out there and she don't even need no panties 
I asked her what she here for she said to visit family 
She asked me what I do. I said trying to win a Grammy 
She said: you think you fancy. I said I'm on a mission 
Trying to sack these quarters, just like I'm out here. Blitzing 
Ain't no use in tripping. We at the beach already 
But Tammy want a boo thang. She tryna keep it steady, 
And. I'M trying to watch my belly like an old school flick, 
Tammy Aunt, Jemima yeah. She too damn thick 
I'm afraid to get the flu, then I'd be too damn sick, 
And. I'M all up on these drums, like a blue man. Stick 
 
This feel like a new caddy with this windows rolled down. X2 
This feel like the 1990's with a brand new sound 
In, a brand new caddy with the windows rolled down. 
 
This feel like this. Every summer OTM my mantra, 
My friends, be at the mill
rolling up some ganja 
Enough to fill your lungs up stay linked up like some nun-chucks 
You can never reach our level. So you better get your 1's up, 
Started right here from the ground up, put them grounds up and announce us 
We. The now stuff pronouns us 
we, killing everything like Round-Up 
Where, the doe at for the crown buck. Tell the venue turn my sound up. 
There ain't! No lames around us, we marching through the town, what
 
Left Right, Left Right down up. We change the game forever. 
Any every endeavor
