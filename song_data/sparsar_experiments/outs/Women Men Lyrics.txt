Women Men Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


Women men, 
Women women, women, women, men, 
Women men, 
Women, women, women, women, men, 
I'm, gon', lose my mind. Dear Lord 
Cause, Mama Dorothy can't cry no more 
Have mercy on my soul, 
For not having mercy on my foes 
 
If success is a 10 foot wall. They give you a 5 foot ladder 
Niggas wishing death on me, hoping I lose my bladder 
Or my pockets on malnutrition, but they keep getting fatter 
That's. Why they mad at me, but actually I never been no rapper 
The fuck is a royalty check. J gave a couple advances 
But to pay bills. I was taking penitentiary chances, 
He wanted to borrow money, but I ain't give it to him 
So. Now he like, when we see Z-Ro, let's run up on him and give it to him shit 
I wish a motherfucker. Would 
Kidnap you kill? You drop you off in the motherfucking woods 
You talentless. I can't help that I'm, this motherfucking good 
You regular weed to a kush smoker, not that motherfucking good 
Fuck feeding these niggas fish I'd rather show' em how to catch they own 
And. That'S when they get mad where they at now. I guess they gone 
Hate that I'm here for a real reason: 
But no offence to no broke bitch, I'm on my seventeenth season, 
 
Women men, 
Women women, women, women, men, 
Women, men, 
Women, women, women, women, men, 
I'm, gon', lose my mind. Dear Lord 
Cause, Mama Dorothy. Can'T cry no more 
Have mercy on my soul: 
For not having mercy on my foes 
 
First off fuck the world when the shit gon' change 
Soutside, where we ride Hoover, Crippin, mane, 
Fucking right, I'm a player but never touched your wife 
Really tryna. Do you a favour, don't fuck up your life, 
Got niggas watching me like they undercovers and spies 
And I can tell which ones cause. They can't look me in my eyes, 
Wonder, why you ain't heard from them and they can't be found 
I betcha. You can find'em if you look in the ground 
Bitch. I know you you rap about the shit. You ain't go through 
Always, telling people you did shit. You saw Ro do 
I'm a gangster capital murder, that's what I am 
You's a state jail felony less than a gram: 
 
Women men, 
Women women, women, women, men, 
Women, men, 
Women, women, women, women, men, 
I'm, gon', lose my mind. Dear Lord 
Cause, Mama Dorothy can't cry. No more 
Have mercy on my soul, 
For not having mercy on my foes 
 
My brotha you on Facebook, all the time liking, brother fights, 
You a modern day slave no fucks, given about your brother's life. 
You'D rather see us kill each other won't even stand up for your brother
rights 
Ole Ku Klux Klan ass with a tan, ass, nigga, 
Always, beggin everybody for money. When you ain't got none 
Be actin, like you, don't know nobody. When you got some 
I. Don'T owe you nothing cuz you just came home 
Like yo name, be on the same check that my name on 
Matter fact. I ain't get shit from y'all when I came home, 
They be like Ro. I ain't no rapper tho, my change ain't long 
I could save these niggas lives, but they still would complain 
Appreciate ya, but what took so motherfuckin long, mane 
Then. They wonder why my attitude is Fuck'em all 
If, I'm real and y'all fake. That mean it ain't nothing. We can discuss at all, 
I didn't hear about it. I was right there when that man got down. 
Shouldn'T have been havin', so many conversations downtown 
 
Women men, 
Women women, women, women, men, 
Women men, 
Women, women, women, women, men, 
I'm, gon', lose my mind. Dear Lord 
Cause Mama Dorothy can't cry no more 
Have mercy on my soul, 
For not having mercy on my foes
