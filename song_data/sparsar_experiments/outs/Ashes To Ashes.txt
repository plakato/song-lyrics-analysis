Ashes To Ashes
by Woody Guthrie.

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.
Show me a woman that a man can trust.
Snakes on the desert and fish in the sea.
A rattlesnake mama made a sucker out of me.

O tell me how long must I have to wait?
Can I get you now or must I hesitate?

Bacon to bacon and beans to beans.
I got a cornbread mama in New Orleans.
Turtles in the rivers, alligators in the swamp.
A Louisiana mama keeps a man on the jump.

O tell me how long must I have to wait....

It's beer to beer and ale to ale.
I got a L.A. mama in the Frisco Jail.
Gold in the mountains, copper in the hills.
They caught my gal with a forty gallon still.

O tell me how long must I have to wait....

Ham to ham and eggs to eggs.
If I don't get a pension I'll have to beg.
There's a lot of crooked politician men;.
It would be all right if it wasn't for them.

O tell me how long must I have to wait....

I tried to get a job all over town;.
Seven hundred places they turned me down.
They told me six weeks I could get relief.
But I ain't got a bite to eat.

O tell me how long must I have to wait....
