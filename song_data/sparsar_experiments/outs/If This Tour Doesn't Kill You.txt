If This Tour Doesn't Kill You
by Pup.

If this tour doesn't kill you, then I will
I hate your guts, and it makes me ill
Seeing your face every morning
One more month and twenty-two days
If. This tour doesn't kill you. I may
Counting down the miles'til. We leave the state
I'm counting down the minutes'til. I can erase
Every memory of you

For a second let's be honest
Nothing will clean your filthy conscience
Everything. You do makes me wan na vomit
And. If this tour doesn't kill you buddy, I'm on it

Why, can't we just get along 
Why. Can'T we just get along 
Why. Can'T we just get along 
Why, can't we just get along 

You, think you're, so original

I can't wait for your funeral

Don't wish. You were dead. I wish you'd never been born at all

I'm, trying not to let you get in my head, but every line every goddamn
syllable
That you say, makes me wan na gouge out my eyes with a power drill
If, this tour doesn't kill you
If. This tour doesn't kill you
If. This tour doesn't kill you, then I will
