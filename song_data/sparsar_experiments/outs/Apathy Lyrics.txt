Apathy Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

Slow down a moment and let me try*.
To call your attention to all these things.
You are rapidly passing by.
On your highspeed life.
These children are waving and laughing at you.
But you won't reward it with a smile.
These people are dying and crying.
But you won't even donate a tear.
Have you ever thought about this all.
How the apathy captivates.
You've shut away all your feelings in a heart of stone.
Don't crucify yourself.
Slow down a moment and let me try.
To make you believe that I'd give my everything.
Just to see you smile.
Smile for me.
Slow down a moment.
