Hang On Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


When you feel like Indiana, Indiana Jones.
When they got you in a trap, dodging darts and bones.
When you're on the ropes, on the ropes.
When they got you on the ropes, on the ropes.

You know you got to hang on, hang on.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on, hang on, yeah.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on and don't let go.
Like Indiana Jones, you got to hang on, hang on.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on.

When they throw you down a hole, snakes and scorpions.
When they got you in their evil grips with those ancient forces.
When you're on the ropes, on the ropes.
When they got you on the ropes, on the ropes.

You know you got to hang on, hang on.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on, hang on, yeah.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on and don't let go.
Like Indiana Jones, you got to hang on, hang on.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on.

Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on, hang on.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on, hang on, yeah.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on and don't let go.
Like Indiana Jones, you got to hang on, hang on.
Put your old-found faith as though you got to hang on.
