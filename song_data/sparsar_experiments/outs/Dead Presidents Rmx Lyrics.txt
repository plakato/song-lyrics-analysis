Dead Presidents Rmx Lyrics
by Syko.

Money on my mind, circling around inside my head.
I'm on my grind but minimum wage won't stack the bread, so instead.
I gotta save it up and spend it lightly.
The luxuries will have to wait until my budget ain't so tightly; wound.
Around paying for bills and school.
Cause dropping out for easy money would just make me a damn fool.
I know through hardships you learn life lessons.
And working hard for your success will always bring you blessings so.
I'll leave stackin' the paper for a later time and just focus on the words i.
need to finish this rhyme.
I had some jackson's in my possession.
But they left a trail of tears cause they're disappearing quick throughout the.
recession.
And all my lincolns were emancipated, the washinngtons remain still although.
it's complicated.
To not spend money in this crazy world.
We're on the paper train that makes the world go round no need to add to the.
coals, uh.
Apparently that's how we move along.
The money spendin' paper chasin' is what helps us go on.
But right now i'm gettin' left in the dust.
I'll catch up later i'm just focused on the things that i must, do.
To be the best in all the things i aspire.
Got more than money on my mind that's not my only desire.
Just take a look at any bill if you must.
You shouldn't put your faith in cash, it tells us In God We Trust.
