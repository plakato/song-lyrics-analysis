Broken Man Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: In Triumph.
Broken Man.
I´ve been cruising every highway but I don´t know where I´ve been.
All my life I´ve been rightful, if killing ain´t no sin.
I´ve been trying to remember what I did along the way.
Who I am, where I came from, well I guess it´s all the same.
I know, tomorrow I will beg for today.
I know, I´ve never been afraid.
Yeah I know, I have ruined my plan.
Now I´m standing here as a broken man.
I was given just a little but I ended with a lot.
In the poison I was drowning I deserved just what I got.
I know, tomorrow I will beg for today.
I know, I´ve never been afraid.
Yeah I know, I have ruined my plan.
Now I´m standing here as a broken man.
