King City Lyrics
by Swim Deep.

I wanna be everything that I'm not.
I wanna be rich, I wanna show off.
Just a desperado with a sour twist.
And it'll all come sweet on your lips.

Cause I'm in love, so old.
Put your flowers down, it's too cold.
Fuck your romance, I wanna pretend.
That Jenny Lee Lindberg is my.
girlfriend.

With the sun on my back, it's a nice day.
I will never ch-choose any other way.
x2.

I need to come up to see my friends.
I need to come down to feel insane.
I know I ain't cool right now.
I'm as high as a fool, I'm out of sight, yeah.

With the sun on my back, it's a nice day.
I will never ch-choose any other way.
With the sun on my back, it's a nice day.
I will never ch-choose any other way.
