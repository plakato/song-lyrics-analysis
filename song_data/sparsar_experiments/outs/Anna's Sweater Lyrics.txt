Anna's Sweater Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

On the 22.
Slowly crossing town.
You looked at me.
Yea you were lookin'.
You were lookin' down at me.
So low in subtlety.

Well I'm not the victim here.
That much I know.
That much is clear.
But it's just that much.
It's just that much.

And this I know.
If I could close my eyes.
Hell would give me sire.
Able to see you.
The way I saw that night.
Saw that night.

And if I close my eyes.
Hell would give me sire.
Able to see you.
The way I saw that night.

Soft words echo loud into his ears.
And this is not as bad.
As it, as it appears.
As it appears.

See the clouds light the way.
To a perfect view.
To a perfect day.
It's just that much.
It's just that much.

And this I know.
If I could close my eyes.
Hell would give me sire.
Able to see you.
The way I saw that night.
Saw that night.

And if I close my eyes.
Hell would give me sire.
Able to see you.
The way I saw that night.

On the 22.
Slowly crossing town.
You looked at me.
Yea you were lookin'.
You were lookin' down at me.
So low in subtlety.

I'm not the victim here.
That much I know.
That much is clear.
But it's just that much.
It's just that much.

And yes I know.
If I could close my eyes.
Hell would give me sire.
Able to see you.
The way I saw that night.
Saw that night.

And if I close my eyes.
Hell would give me sire.
Able to see you.
The way I saw that night.
