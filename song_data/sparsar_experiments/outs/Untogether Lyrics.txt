Untogether Lyrics
by Women.

Light all to not tune alarm.
No chance for a tie.
No chance for all time.
Heir impound the sailor malls.
Old pleasure than you.
No pleasure than you.
Moving plea.
Talk to the cop.
To learn more than ever.
Practically.
Plot so hard.
Hold them both together.
Together.
And stalk a new man home.
No chance for a tie.
None chance for all time.
Moving plea.
Talk to the cop.
To learn more than ever.
Practically.
Plot so hard.
Hold them both together.
Together.
