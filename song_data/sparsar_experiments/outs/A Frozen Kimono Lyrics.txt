A Frozen Kimono Lyrics
by XamVolo.


We're coming out of the ozone.
We ain't got no use for our old homes.
You don't hear the news till we're long gone.
We don't deal in money, we deal in time.
We're unstoppable.

That you waste when you're inside.
Prisoners of your own minds.
Prisoners of your own kind.
We're the winners of these goldmines.
We pay our dues.
And we pay the dues of those who said that we were fools.
Payback is overdue.
These black cards heal these black hearts.
And these fast cars, heal these bad scars.

She's gonna set the world alight.
It's a beautiful view, she's beautiful news.
She's gonna drift away from sight.
In the world's greatest heist, escape to the sky.

We're coming out of the ozone.
We ain't got no use for our old homes.
You don't hear the news till we're long gone.
We don't deal in money, we deal in time.
We're unstoppable.

Can be prisoners on your own time.
Prisoners of your own lives.
Prisoners that we're gon' find.
Working in my goldmines.
'Cos we pay our dues.
And we pay the dues of those who doubt us in our youth.
Payback is not our truth.
These black cards, fill these black holes.
And this black soul that's oozing from me.

Is gonna set the world alight.
It's a beautiful view, she's beautiful news.
Purple Jazz burns violet bright.
Silver smoke escapes to the sky.

We're coming out of the ozone.
We ain't got no use for our old homes.
You don't hear the news till we're long gone.
We don't deal in money, we deal in time.
We're unstoppable.

Got a geisha.
In a frozen kimono.
Hidden in our dojo.
She's singing that old song.
About victories and lost love.
Like we pay her to...
