Here to stay - delta heavy remix Lyrics
by Zomboy.

Yeah 
Zomboy 
Alongside, your girl, 
Lady Chann 
 
-chuh, 
Come on- 
I, said voila 
-chuh 
Yo yo yo yo, yo, yo, 
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, 
Yeh 
Me'n. My soldiers are here to stay 
We're here to stay. 
You can't move my army. No no noway way way: 
Noway noway 
Ready for the laws on the test line, hey 
Raised in the bayou. Oh, oh, now pay her 
I am muscle, and I am here to stay-ay-ay 
- come on
