Guns & Ammunition Lyrics
by XOV.


Oh, what have I done?
What have I done? Oh, mmm.

I've always been a rebel, in business with the devil.
Invited to the illuminati, 33 levels.
Guns and ammunition, to get to this commission.
I'm rollin' in the deep, might be resting with the fish'n.

Refrain.
Oh, what have I done? I'm the burning man.
Woah, what have I done? I'm the burning man.

Can't you see how they've watched me, applauded me?
Waited for this day.
To set me on fire and put it all on display.
Woah, what have I done? I'm the burning man.

Fuck your love, I need guns and ammunition.
Guns and ammunition, guns and ammunition.
Fuck your love, I need guns and ammunition.
Guns and ammunition, guns and ammunition.
Fuck your love.

Enemy of the state, all my enemies break.
Til I become the enemy and everything is too late.
A wall of fire, pistols, a citizen at war.
Sometimes I just feel like blast 'em all blast 'em all.

Refrain.
What have I done? I'm the burning man.
Woah, what have I done? I'm the burning man.

Can't you see how they've watched me, applauded me?
Waited for this day.
To set me on fire and put it all on display.
Woah, what have I done? I'm the burning man.

Fuck your love, I need guns and ammunition.
Guns and ammunition, guns and ammunition.
Fuck your love, I need guns and ammunition.
Guns and ammunition, guns and ammunition.
Fuck your love.

A pistol to his head, where's the fucking money?
A pistol to his head, where's the fucking money?
One touch and he's dead, all for the money.
All for the money, all for the money.
A pistol to his head, where's the fucking money?
A pistol to his head, where's the fucking money?
One touch and he's dead, all for the money.
All for the money, money.

Fuck your love, I need guns and ammunition.
Guns and ammunition, guns and ammunition.
Fuck your love, I need guns and ammunition.
Guns and ammunition, guns and ammunition.

Fuck your love, I need guns and ammunition.
Guns and ammunition, guns and ammunition.
Fuck your love, I need guns and ammunition.
Guns and ammunition, guns and ammunition.
Fuck your love.
