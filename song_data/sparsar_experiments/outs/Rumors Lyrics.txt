Rumors Lyrics
by Woop.


Fuck wit, the team 
We balling boo 
Every time. We call them ho 
They falling through 
Word of the day. 
Don'T be no fool, 
I hate it. When a nigga try to tell a nigga bout. You 
Tell me what you heard bout me. 
Bout me bout me 
Nigga, come see me bout me 
Bout me bout me 
Talk to nobody bout me, but me 
But me, but me 
Every thing: ain't, one with me! 
Every thing 700 with me: 
Don't tell him what you heard bout me: 
 
Don't understand how a fuck nigga wan na run his mouth bout me 
Don't understand how you basic hoes wan na keep talking bout me 
Don't, understand how you real niggas had the time to Talk bout me 
Two words for you: fuck niggas, 
Open, mouth squeeze, 
Young nigga with racist rack, 
Real nigga with a case attached, 
Dirty pistol with a face. De-Matched 
You can dance real. Okay, with that 
Creep shit stay away from that 
Do the work where the Haitians at 
Dope cooking, like a baking batch, 
Get cheese, stay away from that 
Black Glock with a beam on it. 
Call me what you want: 
Just, don't call police on me 
And. I keep that lease, the least on me 
Glock ten handgun many beasts on me: 
 
Haters talking them streets, 
But, they ain't, making no noise 
I got an extended clip full of hollow tips. 
And every bullet in it say yours, 
Baby girl, know we balling 
So. She look back when she throw it 
And them haters. On my dick 
And that tat on it say blow it 
You, don't understand what we talking bout 
Niggas telling lies just to run their mouth 
Niggas claim they be balling boys 
So. If your balling boy, where you balling at 
Bully, hit his chest like a heart attack, 
Yeah nigga, all of that 
You ain't in them streets where there gangstas at 
So, why you acting like you want a part of that 
And! We don't talk! No rumors ho 
We chase more cash 
I'm in love with the money. 
You get no cash 
And. We count hundreds. So your pole, ass, 
Dope soul. Why you broke 
So broke? You need a body cast
