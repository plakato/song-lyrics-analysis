EVE Lyrics
by The Underachievers.

Eve Eve yeah Eve, uh yo, 
Step back where she at man, I'm in my zone, 
If, you can't keep up with where I'm at 
Then get your ass back home 
Raise the flag and tell the people come 
The queen is on the throne 
Watch how they leave. You standing there 
Just leave you all alone. 
You were grown up, watching people go and get your own 
Matter of fact. I don't give a f*ck. You guessed that, from my tone, 
I'm a Philly born bred raised, never left my bones: 
I'm a bossy, glossy rebel and worldwide. My name is known: 
 
Ain't, no guessing it's E-V-E 
I'm, the chick that they wish they'd be 
Know. By now, do not f*ck with me.

Swallow your face spit in your eyes,
