No Rival (Acoustic) Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

Fight the good fight attempt for the brave 
This trek for the lost has brought more than a grave 
Bathed in the fire, for you hope, water's, pure 
The, flames will grow higher. It'S taste is your cure. 
I do not fear the world's fire for it burns. For a moment, 
And though it sears my skin, I rest for it shall relent 
With the world at your feet and the fire on your back. 
It has nothing to give me for You've claimed my soul. 
No sacrifice could be too great. 
Some. Think I've lost my mind: abandoned sanity, 
To, speak of truth to find a saving clarity 
For. It will cost my/your life, 
Forsaking comfort and ease to trade. It all for a heart with no rival 
You will be met with strife 
And make you fall to your knees, we'll trade, it all for a heart with no rival 
Throw, all your hate and your wrath into the fire and 
Cast all your pain and your fear Unto the graces 
Of, our God and King for the evil, will attack 
Suffer for His love for it burns for a moment, 
With the world at your feet and fire on your back 
For, the God above for His grace, will not relent. 
No sacrifice could be too great 
Fight the good fight. You know you must be brave, 
This trek for the lost to save 
Eighteen years. I have served the Lord 
And. He has never let me down 
For. It will cost your life 
Forsaking comfort and ease to trade. It all for a heart with no rival 
You will be met with strife 
And make you fall to your knees, we'll trade, it all for a heart with no rival 
Expect suffering and invite all the pain 
Lord. You have changed me and I am not the same. 
Hebrews 13:6.
