Hotel California Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


I wanna leave a silhouette out for my soul.
Something that I could never hoax.
I wanna leave a clumsy rhythm bouncing down the road.
Something that's bouncing on out of hope.
So let your flowers grow wild so you can show your child.
Do I want taste? Do I want recipe?
We could sing the truth, it may sound so sweet.
I stole your tale because you told it to be quiet.
You told it to be quiet 2x.

You told it to be quiet 7x.
You told it to....

Where was my mind when I overshot the corner in my head?
I was drunk, singing Hotel California.
Where was my mind when I overshot the corner in my head?
I was drunk, singing Hotel California.

I wanna be a lip service to my bones.
Don't mean to mock this woman who thinks she's a bird.
Don't wanna settle, love it, must stay airbourne.
You'll hear me, I'll blow your horn.
On Christmas day, I'm gonna fly a plane.
Fill it up with all my favourite names.
Swimming in the clouds, we'll all sing along.
We stole your plane 'cus you said you wouldn't fly it!
You said you wouldn't fly it! 2x.

You said you wouldn't fly it! 7x.
You said you wouldn't....

Where was my mind when I overshot the corner in my head?
I was drunk, singing Hotel California.
Where was my mind when I overshot the corner in my head?
I was drunk, singing Hotel California.

'Does an explanation make it any less impressive?'.
