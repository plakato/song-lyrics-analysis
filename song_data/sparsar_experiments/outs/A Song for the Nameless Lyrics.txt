A Song for the Nameless Lyrics
by Sworn In.

I know I am not like you, and I know this shouldn't be true.
I've rearranged these wires hundreds of times.
I've rearranged these wires hundreds of times.
It's a curse I can't break, for your sake.
I just ache and ache, it might be fake.
But it's a feeling I just can't shake.

So sing along, sing along, sing along now.

So sing along this is just the beginning.

Go ahead, put a gun to my head.
I'm getting fucking used to being treated like I'm mislead.
I've never asked for acceptance, and I'm not starting now.
This entire world's my enemy.
This entire world's my enemy.

Fuck.

We are the birth, we are the construction.
We all are fighting ourselves.
We are fighting ourselves.

So sing along, sing along, sing along now.

So sing along this is just the beginning.

You can't stop a demon within.
It can be covered or imprisoned.
But that demon will show its face.
It can't leave this place.

They say you have to fight your own demons, but how am I supposed to fight.
myself?
They say you have to fight your own demons, but how am I supposed to fight.
myself?
