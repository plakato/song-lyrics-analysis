Borrow You Lyrics
by 40 Glocc.


AKON:.
Can I borrow you for a minute?
Maybe two or five, maybe for the rest of my life.
Borrow you for a minute.
Just us two it's alright.
If you decide to be by my side.
I might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
If your here by my side.
Might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
If your here by my side girl.

40 Glocc:.
Met me a chick from ATL.
Thick as hell.
Names Channel.
She could tell from the status living well.
Loves my cabbage.
Loves my carrots.
My grind, my career.
I shine like a chandelier.
Tell the pilot.
Land in the middle of the ghetto.
I'm still here.
Just for a minute let me borrow your ear.
Make all your troubles disappear.
Bet you never like this here.
Let's pop a bottle bring in the New Year.

AKON:.
Can I borrow you for a minute?
Maybe two or five.
Maybe just for the rest of my life.
Borrow you for a minute.
Just us two, it's alright.
If you decide to be by my side.
I might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
If your here by my side.
Might not give you back.
Might not give you back.

One two... minutes.
All I need to consider.
If she the right one to get with her.
I'm still the same, want the cash, keep the chain.
She don't trip.
Won't complain.
Trip to Spain off the plain.
After party of the chain.
Back to Cali, off the plain.
Black Denali swerving lanes.
With the strap.

Three. Minutes, all I need is your name.
Number to call something to ball.

AKON:.
Can I borrow you for a minute?
Maybe two or five.
Maybe just for the rest of my life.
Borrow you for a minute.
Just us two, it's alright.
If you decide to be by my side.
I might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
If your here by my side.
Might not give you back.
Might not give you back.

I'm off the chain.
I'm off the chain.
Special when I take off the chain.
I'm special.
I can give you special things.
Get you wet without the rain?
Drop the top blow your brain.
Hit the club cop a drink.
It's Akon he don't drink.
Money pouring out the bank.
Flip a coin what to take.
Occupate what you make.
What you like what you hate.
What your type, what you date.
Where you live, where you stay.
I don't care what your race.

AKON:.
Can I borrow you for a minute?
Maybe two or five.
Maybe just for the rest of my life.
Borrow you for a minute.
Just us two, it's alright.
If you decide to be by my side.
I might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
If your here by my side.
Might not give you back.
Might not give you back.
If your here by my side girl.
