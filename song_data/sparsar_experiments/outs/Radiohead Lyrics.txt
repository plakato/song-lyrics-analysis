Radiohead Lyrics
by Un-Ez.


I used to feel alone.
So lonely.
Like the world had disowned me.
Hold up.
Don't get me wrong me wrong man I always had my homies.
We were on the block with the pushas and the Og's.
I ain't have an option that's what poverty.
Bestowed me.
So we would get harrassed by the mother fucking police.
We all from section 8 but pig.
I'm my fucking own me.
Time after time.
Fucking with us for no reason.
Just cause we were colored.
And we were fucking breathing.
Yeah America I was birthed into treason.
Became anamoly when I started believing.
Yeah America I was birthed into treason.
With headphones on.
Plotting on how to get even.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
This shit is therapy.
This shit is my therapy.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
This is my therapy.
I hope that you are hearing me.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
Music is my therapy.
This shit is my therapy.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
Until the day I'm motherfucking dead.

In my mid twentys still cribbing like a baby.
Hold up.
Im talking my parents house.
The struggle drove me crazy.
My confidence was shot.
I was insecure and lazy.
Everything out my mouth ended with a maybe.
5 kids in the same building.
Shit!
Now 2 out of 5 in the building.
Live!
Out of all 5.
I'm glad that I'm alive.
I chose this fucking path.
I ain't have to change my mind.
I'm trying to make a difference.
Keep my peoples out these prison.
That's why these bars I'm spitting don't need many niggas in them.
I'm gonna need some air time.
Yeah I need some air time.
Before i disappear like these motherfucking Airlines.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
This shit is therapy.
This shit is my therapy.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
This is my therapy.
I hope that you are hearing me.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
Music is my therapy.
This shit is my therapy.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
Until the day I'm motherfucking dead.

I'm about to confuse shit.
Did radio kill music?
Hold up wait.
Chris, Lu.
Did radio kill music?
The same shit I'm using.
The same shit that fixed me.
When I was feeling useless.
The same shit I bump.
In my ride.
When I'm cruising.
This drug I'm abusing.
Gotta me fucked up being so dope.
Got me losing.
We live in a fucked up nation.
I say it how it is.
The poor get poorer.
While the rich keeps getting.
Hold up the poor gets poorer.
So the rich could so my dick.
Unless I give them money.
The radio won't play my shit.
I feel freedom when I speak.
Freedom in my speech.
Freedom in my soul.
Freedom when i reach.
Freedom when i preach.
Freedom when i feed the beast.
Thats living inside of me.
That i been keeping confidential.
Till the album is complete.
So how can I not reach my dreams.
When i write these in my sleep?
How can I not reach my dreams.
When I write these in my sleep?

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
This shit is therapy.
This shit is my therapy.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
This is my therapy.
I hope that you are hearing me.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
Music is my therapy.
This shit is my therapy.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
Until the day I'm motherfucking dead.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
This shit is therapy.
This shit is my therapy.

I'm a fucking Radiohead.
I'm a fucking Radiohead.
Until the day I'm motherfucking dead.
