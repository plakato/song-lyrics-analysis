Who dat call the police 
Yo ma called the police. 
I got five on the lips 
But. I ain't payin for the ass 
You. Just got yo hair fixed 
So. Can you pump a nigga gas 
Now when you ridin in my truck? Can you pick a nigga dick 
I got a boonapolist, so can you be my trick? 
C-Murder called you hoes, like some fuckin crash dummies, 
It ain't love. When the motherfucking sex cost money, 
I ain't dissin, you hoes, 
I, just don't love you hoes 
In, yo, raggedy, ass, Girbauds, 
When, you swangin on them, poles! 
Now! If you trippin, then you know you livin trife 
And. If you dippin, I can't put you in my life 
Cause all hoes suck dick 
Let me tell you dog, hoes, you fuckin with 
See. I don't play no games and i don't sweat. No hoes 
 Well. Bitch. Take off your clothes 
Talk that shit now roll with it 
Ya warefare check hoe, go get it 
 
 Check, dem, hoes,

Check dem hoes nigga! Is you crazy 
You can stunt all you want, but that shit don't phase me 
 in front yo boys. Like you made me nigga 
I hold my own 
Reppin like you gon shine 
Nigga. You is a waste of time, 
Gettin that ho to step to me. 
I gets down for mine 
Me and my girls. We don't play no games. 
Fuck, you lames 
When, you walkin on side of me, 
I'm bringin, you pain. 
You can talk that shit about suck yo dick 
Get, a grip, 
Broke bitch, you ain't. The shit 
You know who you fuckin wit, 
Drop, a baby for you

Got, no time for the lies. All niggas is tricks.
