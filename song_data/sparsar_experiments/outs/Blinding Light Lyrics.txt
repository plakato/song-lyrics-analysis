Blinding Light Lyrics
by Switchfoot.


Hey boy, don't believe 'em.
The old lies never could come true.
Hey boy, don't believe 'em.
Everything that they told you to.

Hey boy, don't believe 'em.
We're the nation that eats our youth.
Hey boy, don't believe 'em.
None of us are bullet proof.

Deep down there's a boy inside.
Asleep waiting for the sun to rise.
Wake up, wake up.

I'm still looking for the blinding light.
I'm still looking for the reason why.
I'm still looking for the sun to shine.
And take me higher and higher.

All my life.
I've been living in the darkest night.
Still looking for the blinding light.
To take me higher and higher.

Hey girl, be yourself now.
Don't believe what they told you to.
Hey girl, be yourself now.
Your skin's more than a pin-up suit.

Hey girl, don't conform now.
No one else got soul like you.
Hey girl, you're a strong one.
But none of us are bullet proof.

Deep down there's a hope inside.
You've got wings but you're scared to fly.
Wake up, wake up.

Deep down there's a hope inside.
Brighter than the fears in my mind.
I keep looking for the blinding light.
It's the hope that keeps me alive.
Wake up, wake up.

The blinding light.
Been waiting all my life.
To take me higher and higher.
The blinding light.
You're the vision that gives me sight.
Oh, the blinding light.
Take me higher and higher.
