Calm Down Juliet (What A Drama Queen) Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Hello lovely. I'm corruption.
noticed that you seemed a little down.
Just sign right here, on this line and;.
I can change your life.
This is a blind shot in the dark.
I don't think what you need is love.
Just take that off.
We're gonna make you a star.
We'll sell your soul, like its gold.

Get away from this place.
Cigarettes and cheap lipstick.
And I, know this world ain't turning for us.
Get away from all this plastic love.
Let me be your drug.

Dead inside; my skin crawls up my spine.
I gotta get the fuck out.

Hello darling. Name's seduction.
find something comfortable.
Let me take your coat.
Don't be reluctant, Oh!

Nothing you want can phase me.
I'm all ice inside, baby.
Let's fix that addiction, you're sick n' I've got the remedy so save the.
speech.
Leave all your sorrow at the door, the dead don't need it anymore. I told.
you....

Can I be something.
Other than a “Sistine Wet Dream”.
I'm not a fucking, fix for, a fiend.
What's more, I didn't sign up to be a…
Yes. You. Did.

Perfume &amp; Parliaments to pacify my clientele.
We're all mad here. That's why we're living in hell.
The desperate, the broken, the homeless;.
I go and take what I want &amp; I want it now.

I gotta; get away from this place.
Baby you look ravishing.
Inebriants and deviants;.
No better place for you to sleep.

Get out, I gotta get out.

Dead inside; my skin crawls up my spine.
Dead inside; my body aches from swine all over me.
Get the fuck out.
