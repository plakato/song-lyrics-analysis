Heat Distraction Lyrics
by Women.

Scoot and make as was.
Smell come in on the train.
Then dunk in sacrone.
Left at trow's ennui.
All ours anchor.
To the aching bone.
Programmed without form.
Programmed without sound.
Austere known your pen.
Throats inside of glass.
Hanging next to me.
Eyes all disappear.
Gloss tones speak in turn.
Chew in such a rush.
Lands strength a rolling home.
Lie doesn't hold mass.
I found myself awake and walking.
The two of you arrive.
Backs turned to the spitting.
But they have not a dream.
No one was there.
Look towards the face.
Becoming very clear.
