The Golden Age Lyrics
by Woodkid.


Walking through the fields of gold.
In the distance, bombs can fall.
Boy we're running free.
Facing light in the flow.
And in the cherry trees.
We're hiding from the world.

But the golden age is over.
The golden age is over.

Boy, we're dancing through the snow.
Waters freeze, the wind blows.
Did you ever feel.
We're falling as we grow.
No I would not believe.
The light could ever go.

But the golden age is over.
The golden age is over.

Breakdown.

Listen, I can hear the call.
As I'm walking through the door.
Did you ever dream.
We'd miss the mornings in the sun.
The playgrounds in the streets.
The bliss of slumberland.
Boy, we are family.
No matter what they say.
But boys are meant to flee.
And run away one day.

When golden age is over.
When the golden age is over.
But the golden age is over.
The golden age is over.
