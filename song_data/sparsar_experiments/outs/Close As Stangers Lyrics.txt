Close As Stangers Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


Six weeks since I've been away and now your saying everything has changed.
And I'm afraid that I might be losing you.
Now every night that I spend alone, kills me thinking of you on your own.
And I wish I was back home next to you.

Oh everyday, you feel a little bit further away.
And I don't know what to say.

Are we wasting time.
Talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages.
I feel like we're as close as strangers.
I won't give up.
Even though it hurts so much.
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces.
Now it feels we're as close as strangers.

Late night calls and another text, is this as good as we're gonna get?
Another time zone taking me away from you.
Living dreams and fluorescent lights, while you and I are running out of time.
But you know that I'll always wait for you.

Oh everyday, you feel a little bit further away.
And I don't know what to say.

Are we wasting time.
Talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages.
I feel like we're as close as strangers.
I won't give up.
Even though it hurts so much.
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces.
Now it feels we're as close as strangers.

On the phone, I can tell that you wanna move on.
Through the tears.
I can hear that I shouldn't have gone.
Every day, gets harder to stay away from you.
So tell me are we wasting time.
Talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages.
I feel like we're as close as strangers.

Wasting time.
Talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages.
I feel like we're as close as strangers.
I won't give up.
Even though it hurts so much.
Every night, I'm losing you in a thousand faces.
Now it feels we're as close as strangers.

6 months since I went away, I didn't know everything has changed.
But tomorrow I'll be coming back to you.
