Deliverance Song Lyrics
by Sway UK.


I have got a PLAN now if I add an “E” that would get me a PLANE.
Now if I add a “T” take me to another PLANET no gravity.
I'm trying to get heard by the whole galaxy.
Speaking of WHOLES, take away the “W”.
But don't get sucked in try and succeed.
The mind is very ODD but take away the “D” and add a “G” we're nearly good see.
GOD is all we need.
Devil is pure EVIL take away the “D” his influence is like NEEDLES trying to.
get in your stream but if you add an “S” you will see that he's NEEDLESS.
Trying to make your life a SHAM but if you add an “E” then you can put him to.
SHAME.
It's time to STAMPEDE now take away the “E” for they want us marked by the.
BEAST.
Now take away the “A” I'm trying to be the BEST they want to replace the “S”.
get an “A” for effort But they still can't see me on the BEAT.
Now take away the “B” for I have got to EAT, no I ain't on a DIET but take.
away the “T”.
I ain't ready to DIE yet I've got so much to see.
So “F” the devils LIE live your LIFE I am free.
Welcome to my DELIVERANCE.

Oh my Father.
Lead us to our blessings.
And though we're sinners please don't deny us.
We're trying.
We get scared of the weather outside.
But we will keep on fighting with pride.
Even when the sun goes down and there's no one around.
I'll be singing my Deliverance Song.

Oh fair Jezebel, pretty as a petal.
Only money drives her men are just a PEDAL.
She gets “M” for “P” still they want her like a MEDAL.
And even through the dust you can see she'll never settle.
For less than gold or any above METAL.
Add an “N” ‘cause at the end you're left MENTAL.
“OR” instead of “AL” now let my music be your MENTOR.
Keep your mind OPEN take the “O” now watch me PEN talk.
Met her on my journeys, picked her up in my CAR.
Then we had “S” now we can only find SCARS.
I gave her an “E” after I gave her the “D” and now we're both living in fear.
that we'll never find that divine path.
Hard to do a you turn when you're living your life FAST.
Take the “F” add a “P” take a look at my PAST.
Take a left now I park, I'm planning to l-eve her.
She's l-eden me straight to “L” somebody pull the LEVER.
Replace the “R” with an “L” now I'm on a different LEVEL to ‘em.
Higher than TREBLE take the “T” now I'm a REBLE to ‘em.
I've seen PAIN “R” for “P” seen RAIN and even if I swapped the “A” for a “U” I.
would never RUIN.
Showbiz is CUTE but take away the “E” and you'll see she's ready to CUT you.
and take away a piece.
Of your soul, for what its worth, what's become of earth.
I'm a show you a different WORLD, no “L” you have my WORD.

Oh my Father.
Lead us to our blessings.
And though we're sinners please don't deny us.
We're trying.
We get scared of the weather outside.
But we will keep on fighting with pride.
Even when the sun goes down and there's no one around.
I'll be singing my Deliverance Song.
