Like a Drug Lyrics
by Queen of Hearts.


You were my darkness after the light.
In a way, you brought me to life.
And you opened my eyes for the first time.
I'm lost in every single way.
I know, but somehow, your love burns deep.
And makes me go.

You give me a rush.
Love feels like a drug.
You give me a rush.
Love feels like a drug.
Love feels like a drug.
Love feels like a drug.

Time doesn't always play on your side.
When your hearts starts to defy.
And you hold on to tears that you can't cry.
I'm crushed by every moment spent with you.

With the touch of your lips.
Lightning bolts fill the air.
One flick of a switch.
We collide without a care.
Feel my body.
Say you love me.
Feel my body.
Say you love me.
