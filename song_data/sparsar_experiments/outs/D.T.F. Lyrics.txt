D.T.F. Lyrics
by Ryan Bowers.


Girl, I told you not to fall in love with a player like me.
New city every night, plenty of wifeys.
Might be, in your town getting faded, wasted.
And you know we getting paid!
I'll be dude for the night.
That dope white rapper that can get that pussy right.
She turn into a dope fiend over the pipe.
Hopped out the pussy like.
It's okay, we in this thing California dreaming.
Soon as I step on the stage, I hear them bitches screaming.
Fiending for money and marijuana, the life of a west side player.
Too official might run for mayor.
Aye, don't get your heart broke.
Use your brain but I ain't talking bout your smarts though.
We only fucking don't get lost in your feelings.
Baby, I'm on the move.
I promise I'm 'gon forget them, listen.

Can't you see.
I'm not what you need.
Girl, just pass that weed and don't fall in love with me.

Don't want no love, no love.
D.T.F., we down to fuck.

Girl, You too bad and I might label you perfect.
Beautiful inside as well as upon the surface.
Got me tongue tied, I eat the pussy in cursive.
But if we put in sex, you making your product {?}.
Baby, you got me tripping, thought you was out of my league.
Put them groupies on the bench and I made you my M.V.P.
But I can't believe.
That I got the greatest, you got me infatuated.
But I might be too fascinated cause girl you just that amazing.
Got my mind right, she got that brain good.
But you ain't bout to hit the breezy with the back wood.
Shawty, got the kicks, I got no brakes.
Ain't no stopping when I'm in the box.
Bout to get up out of it.
Bout to get back on tour and we mobbing.
To a new city, gonna see some new titties.
Gotta get a new bitch to come and get faded, get loose with me.
I can be with one chick when I'm old.
But now I got to get this dough on the road, So....
