Aeolian harp (under the world) Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

WOVENHAND.
Now is the end of the gentile.
Pluck aeolian harp my child.
Beyond the lust of this moment.
Thin as a pine slat.
It does no good to call you mine.

You're a big brown bull.
Button up and button down.
Now grim pilgrim.
He come around.
As he did he will roll.
Drivin' like there ain't no god at all.

He digs his hole.

Do you see the day far on.
Brothers it is a line.
There is no buffalo outside rifle child.
It is more than hunger.
That betrays my heart.
