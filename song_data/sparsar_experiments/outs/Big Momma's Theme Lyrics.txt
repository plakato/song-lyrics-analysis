Big Momma's Theme Lyrics
by Vita.

Jermaine 
Yo New York in da house 
 
Brooklyn in da house 
Uptown in da house 
Chi Town in da house 
Atlanta. Georgia are you in da house 
West Coast in da house 
Vita 
Everybody in da house 
Baby baby come on 
Baby come on 
 
Vita 
Yo yo yo, who that be 
V-I-T-A, 
Big Momma lady murders, away 
We play twenty-four hours a day, 
Mind on money twenty-four hours a Day 
It's hard to say or tell 
When, there's love in the air 
So. I continue to be Miss Dawg of the year. 
And. Take care of my peeps when the streets is hot. 
You need a place to stay. Just pull out the cot 
And. I swerve in the two-door car without no shotgun 
Driver, took'em lukewarm to hot, like lava 
I, not one. That'S forgotten, 
There's, a lot of haters that be hatin' for nothing 
With their hand out waitin' for something 
Chick. Like me, I waits for nothin' 
Put in work till the cake come in 
So, breathe easy. Whenever you need me, 
Just yell V-I-T-A know it well.

This is Big. Momma'S house 
We ain't gon, take no poppin' off at the mouth. 
This is Big. Momma'S house 
Those that get a chance to dance 
They get turned out. 
This is Big. Momma'S house 
One night spent here 
Have you climbing up the wall. 
This is Big. Momma'S house 
We ain't gon na take no mess at all 
 
Da, Brat 
You know how Da Brat-tat get 
The dough stack. What 
Ready for combat get your head? Cracked 
What 
Could cook a steak up and dice that paper 
Chop it up like onions to add that flavor 
I'm fresh, even your mami wish I was her seed 
I rip a hole in the track, as it bleed, 
I, breeve, on'em and make'em feel the heat 
Obviously. It'S evident, I can't be beat what 
I strut in dem thirty-eight jeans or the fitted ones. 
Either way you still wan na split something 
Could, it be the curves in the waist 
Or. Could it be the Suburban I push when I swerve through the place? 
 Got the nerve to not be able to be replaced, 
Haters can't tap in cause. I can't be traced 
This. My house don't speak until spoken to 
Disrespect me and I'm choking you what 
 
Jermaine 
No uh come on. 
 
Put your hands up; 
Put your hands up; 
Put your hands up; 
 
Destiny's, Child 
No; no
