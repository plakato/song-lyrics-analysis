The Statement Lyrics
by RuMeal.


I'm your favorite local rappers local rapper they admire.
If a soul was over priced that's why I never found a buyer.
Let's be real I got the feeling no one's better than me.
Cause I look around &amp; none of y'all know what competitive be.
A demon child raised in the wild around churches &amp; angels.
Want the American dream so bad I'm stared spangled.
Rap about the coke for mainstream success, then you soda pop.
Claiming it's your time to blow you must be on a broken clock.
You got it, then I'm coming to get it, while sparing no feelings.
Your limit it's stuck at the ceiling, I'm saying good riddance.
This life, it's taking it's toll, I'm coming for vengeance.
You name it, I'm taking it all, &amp; spreading my vision.
For anybody claiming they got it, it's time to stop it.
For fans screaming better product, just know that I got it.
Been doing this for 24 I pray for 20 more.
Stop buying that bullshit that they're selling &amp; come see what's in store.
