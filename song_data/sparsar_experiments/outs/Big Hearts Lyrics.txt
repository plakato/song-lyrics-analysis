Big Hearts Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Give me a melody.
Give me a feeling.
Give me somthing I can finally believe in.
I need the memories.
But I need the meaning.
Give me something I can finally sink my teeth in.
The same bands.
The same girls.
Big hearts.
Small world.
Bad backs.
The wrong tracks.
The right time to come back.
When you're up all night.
It's the right time to come back again.
When you've lost the fight.
It's the right time to come back again.
When the water gets rough.
It's the right time to come back again.
If you're falling out of love.
It's the right time to come back again.
All these old words.
They used to be my gospel.
Now they're battered and bruised.
And left in the hospital.
Without insurance.
I can assure it.
When they get back on their feet no one can ignore it.
The same bands.
The same girls.
Big hearts.
Small world.
Regret.
Repress.
Rebuild.
When you're up all night.
It's the right time to come back again.
When you've lost the fight.
It's the right time to come back again.
When the water gets rough.
It's the right time to come back again.
If you're falling out of love.
It's the right time to come back again.
Champions adjust.
Sometimes the lines are so far gone.
Give me a melody.
Give me a feeling.
Give me somthing I can finally believe in.
It's the right time to come back.
When you're up all night.
It's the right time to come back again.
When you've lost the fight.
It's the right time to come back again.
When the water gets rough.
It's the right time to come back again.
If you're falling out of love.
It's the right time to come back again.
