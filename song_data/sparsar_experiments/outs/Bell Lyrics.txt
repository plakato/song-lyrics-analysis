Bell Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Once again the rubber prize.
Her breathing hand never makes that sound.
For all i know it's in the stairs and it's all around.
A grinding insect sound.
Her bell voice did let ring.
I look up and lose sense of things.
I took a look way outside.
An hour less though and then it's mine.
A borrowed dime she scrimped and saved.
My doubt grew strong but she bought some time.
I came down in Tennessee.
I took a look she's undone me.
Made it stain high and alive.
I can't wait though it's fine.
It's fine now.
He's done.
He's almost there.
He's not allowed.
But he can't stop now.
