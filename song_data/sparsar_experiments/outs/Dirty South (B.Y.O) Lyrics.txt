Dirty South (B.Y.O) Lyrics
by PureMatics.


Angikhohlwa
Langi phuma khona

There is fear lingering in the air tonight

Freshly fried fresh flesh on the menu

This is not beef mate

You bit the bait

And. Now you are about to meet your maker

Go and throw a stone at Mecca

16, shooter Glock, with arcog scope

Armor piercing, ammo

With extra clips

Im, packing more

Like Rambo

One. Two or three

Cos eMzilikazi abekho abafakazi

Fakaza, bazokwenza umfelo kazi

I, grew up Emzilikazi gwaza capital of the world

Bulala umgodoyi culture. Capital of the south

My street cred is as long as Malankani

Ngilobhova ngilenkani

Ngithwele ngigaxe ngifile

Angikhohlwa, langi, phuma, khona

Dirty south., Dirty cars.

Angikhohlwa, langi, phuma, khona

Dirty streets, dirty swag.

Angikhohlwa, langi, phuma, khona

Dirty, cash., Dirty doggs.

Dirty, coppers and robbers with Dirty minds

Dirty souls with dirty intentions.

Ngilenkani ngilo bhova

Ngithwele, ngigaxe, ngifile

Inkafula, kufa

Dubula, dubula

Dirty, Matics Da Verbal hurricane

I break your soul on a Guinness book of World record schematics

Now. You feel how i felt

When. I heard you got beef with me

None of your fantastic

Mr Fox sh*t

Can phase. Me

I`M BYO certified Gangsta man

This kwaito-rap game is mine

So. If a dog chews shoes whose shoes does he choose 

Boasting, is a mug`s game. Son

I break up a brother up

Like Jesus broke bread

And. I only have two emotions

Hungry and horny man

If. You don't see me with an erection

Tell your bitch. To make me a jam. Sandwich

Life is a sexually transmitted disease

Everyday. I beat my record for the most

Conservative days. I have remained alive

I. Never take your death threats. Seriously

Cos in the dirty south

Nobody comes out of beef alive. Anyway

These are the days of our lives.
