Bring the Digital Rain Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

Come on you think I didn't know? It's basically written on your clothes.
So this is how it's gonna go from here on out.

Ohhhh, you called me down and out and underground now I'm the one who's.
calling you.

Now that I've been given the chance, this is my ransom my list of demands.
Just don't ever cross that line or I'll kill you where you stand.

You said 'can't we just be friends', I said 'of course we can.
So long as you never set foot in Connecticut again, we're even'.

So go ahead and hold your shores, I hope this letter strikes a chord.
That makes your insides shred, over and over and over again.
Then attack the sea, hoping that it fractures.
Cause everything that ever happens makes me wish we never did.

You said 'can't we just be friends', I said 'of course we can.
So long as you never set foot in Connecticut again, we're even'.

I'm throwing it down in the motherfucking pit, and I hope you get crushed by.
it.
OHHHH.

So go head and blame it on your face.
Those dirty looks you can't replace.
All those hearts you were proud to break are gonna bury you.
So let me remind you one more time.

You said 'can't we just be friends', I said 'of course we can.
So long as you never set foot in Connecticut again, we're even'.

As long as you never set foot in Connecticut again, we're even.
So long as you never set foot in Connecticut again, we're even.
