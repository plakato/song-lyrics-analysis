Who's in the House Lyrics
by Unity Klan.


Jesus is in the house.
My Lord is in the house.

We be the ones that be comin out, strong.
Never comin wrong, never comin weak.
Wit Jesus at the peak then we never feel the heat.
Unique styles, Unity likes to bust.
Its a must that we put all trust.
In Jesus, be the one who rocks the show.
A Kings in the house then the spirit gots to flow.
Oh so, things are gettin rough in the hood.
Comin along to the side where the party's all good.
Startin Jesus Christ the host, don't need to boast.
Gives you the most of a double dose of the Holy Ghost.
So get your praise on all night long.
We gon tear down the strong hold to the break of dawn.
But first we gon get high in the spirit.
If the devil try da smoke then you know he gonna choke.
Off tha Jesus chronic so bionic.
Low Pro and the devil tryin to get supersonic.
So if you hear me won't ya holla.
Then get yo hands up and worship the father.
Boom there goes the devil's doom.
In the room there goes a little mouse.
Who's in the house.

Chrous.

Live in the hood in 97.
Jesus is in the mix in the mist Unity is my click.
And I roll wit as I flow wit the ghost.
No we don't stop til your body drops fool.
Wit that Holy hip hoper praisin higher the Father.
Mi Papa, nobody stoppin us.
Got the green light from the top gun.
Lets have some fun, wit the demons on the mob.
Something proper, stompin in bumpin in wit the bass.
And the treble, He's that rebel steady mobbin.
Should I say lynchin when I'm rhymin.
The Lord, watches my back, Unity by my side.
Ready to step and bury the devil wit a shovel.
Got my double barrel shot gun.
Get ready to run, we're preachin the word.
Let's get it on til the night is gone.
Day we be breakin and shakin.
No time for mistakin just bakin.
The devil cause he thinks he's clever.
You'll never see the light, its gonna be alright.
For ya here tonight, when ya party on wit the Son.
It's all fun, we the Holy Ghost party.
We started breakin strong holds of the enemy.
Worthy of payin, He's the one in the house.
Now tell me, Who's in the house?

When I creep up to the mic and you begin to here the rupture.
Thinkin bout the end like I'm caught up in the rapture.
I got my Lord on my side, He's omnipotent.
He's the one that changed my life and made me to repent.
I got my flow from my God can you understand.
God has planned this, devil can't stand this oh yeah.
Im on this mission can you handle what I got to say.
I bring my army, it's my Bible each and every day.
As you feel the bass comin down in the ground.
We got the sound that makes you wanna move around.
We're from the Unity down for the G O D.
Cause we got the power that will set you free.
Life up your hands, lift Jesus high.
He's the Alpha Omega, did I mention He's my Christ.
My God's view is reality we got authority.
Praisin G O D cause He sets us free.
Dont drip cause you can't try to bang me or play me.
Ive been washed by the blood G.
It's like that, and no trippin on the one of deez.
Cause God is the praise that I wrote.
So jus sit back relax put your seatbelt on.
Wit the G O D, no you can't go wrong.
It's all good in the hood when you're praisin His name.
Now shamed to my game.
Now tell me, Who's in the house?
