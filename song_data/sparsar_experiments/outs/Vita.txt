Just in case you didn't know, 
Vita, be that feisty chick 
Not really impressed with ice and shit 
See, I'm more concerned with dough 
How to stack it and let it grow. 
Picture me in a custom drop five double O 
Y'all, don't know, 
I spit it sick, like Lupus 
Each bar making it hard for you to dupe this 
And. The truth is, I'm nothing nice 
Late night on the corner with my thugs throwing the dice 
This is for my slick cats, moving some'vest 
And, all of my bitches who's stripping, trying to pay for some messes 
Don't get discouraged, get your dough, mama 
You, better know. I'Mma milk, this game until I'm filthy 
See, how I'm built G 
Genuine dime, one of a kind 
So what you selling I ain't, buying 
So nigga, stop trying 
Straight out the gate. Five hundred thou in one week 
Making it hard for you broads to eat

Vivid and hotter than a lot of broads. They timid, 
If you hearing that hot shit 
Then. You know that I spitted 
And bitches you shitted on 
Then. You know that I shitted 
I never been the type to like to hound. No nigga 
My world. Don'T revolve around no nigga 
See. I don't put it down for niggas, 
Cock and bust rounds for niggas. 
And took pies out of town on Greyhound for niggas 
It's Vita diva mami. You find me in a two-seater 
Leaning low for the Jersey, Turnpike blowing drogue 
Balling like Rebecca Lobos 
Spitting, this fire, so you birds will burn 
What. It'S gone. Take for y'all to learn. 
That! You broads got fat while I starved it's. My turn. 
It won't stop until well. Over a billion is burned, 
Straight out the gate. Five hundred thou in one week 
Making it hard for you broads to eat
