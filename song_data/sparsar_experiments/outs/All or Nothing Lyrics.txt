All or Nothing Lyrics
by X.

I thought you'd listen to my reason.
But now I see you don't hear a thing.
Got to make you see how it's got to be.
Yes if it's all right.
All or nothing yeah yeah.
All or nothing.
All or nothing for me.
Things could work out just like I want them to.
If I could have the other half of you.
That's all I would if I only could.
Is to say.
All or nothing oh yeah.
All or nothing if I could I'd say.
All or nothing for me.
Pa pa pa pa ta pa pa pa ta ta.
Pa pa pa pa ta pa pa pa ta ta.
I ain't telling you no lie girl.
So don't just sit there and cry girl.
All or nothing.
All or nothing.
All or nothing.
All or nothing.
