Lights Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


In the dawn of every day.
I will miss the subtle rays.
Of shooting stars.
And moonlight on the trees.
What once was in its place.
Is now gone without a trace.
And I am left with nothing but a memory.

Take me back to see that sky.
Where the planets were not shy.
And the milky way.
Was brighter than the sun.
When I stopped to share my sights.
I found no words to let me try.
And I am left with feelings only just begun.

Like fireworks, I saw the lights.
Filling up my shadow.
When night falls, the stars shine bright.
Like a road to carry me home.

All the things I'd wish to see.
I know are waiting there for me.
The shooting stars.
And moonlight on the trees.
What once was in its place.
Is now a dream for me to chase.
And I am left with visions of our galaxy.

Yeah, I'm the wolf and I'll carry on.
There's only stars in my soul now.
So take me back to the summertime.
To the forest and the night's call.
