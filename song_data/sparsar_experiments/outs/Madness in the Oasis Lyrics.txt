Madness in the Oasis Lyrics
by Quelle Chris.


That green pack against your stomach right.
The whole gang getting run tonight.
If we ain't doing nothing we ain't doing nothing right.
Splash on them get them wet cash on them.
Flash on them.
The ladies love it.
We make it simple.
Away one hunned never fifty fifty.
The blunt roll game's nifty.
Need more sticky.
Tax on the new t-zitch.
Balling till I'm in the coffin.
Rick living the dream you can't pinch me.
The spin speed exotic must be forward.
Extra special to rest with.
Chat about it in the halls.
The guys will cost the cost man.
That new friendship.
N*ggas they give their life for.
The crowns are far from being adorned a light form.
It's always dawn when the mic's on wax on.
Paint the fence master the bass it's often amazing.
Caught a mage and cast a spell some are silence them.
I'm aligned with the baddest brazen mason.
Ripped the shirt like a savage.
? scavenge.
Madness in the oasis.
Open the gates and let them have it.
I'll eat your speakers.
Your microphone.
What is this.
Is this a joke.
I've seen it all.
You may sound like you never seen it.
You should go away.
Grow old and melt.
You are not innocent.
You will burn just like the rest of the city.
No love no love.
People burn.
Killer.
I don't know.
It's like like fuck like some old man told me that like he's still that.
nobody's going to the moon and no shit like that.
And all the aliens are down here.
You know what I mean.
You got fucking reptilians and fucking androids and shit.
I don't know what the fuck's real man.
I mean then you just you just got fake people fake fucking people.
You know what I mean.
You gotta deal with that shit too.
N*ggas ain't real.
