Affected Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


I feel you looking at me.
Thinking that my happiness.
Is just a front and.
I still want you like I did back then.

You walk around this town like.
You're somebody's king.
But baby, trust me.
There ain't nothing that could.
Make me hungry for you again.

I'm not affected.
You've been rejected.
Written off my heart.
There is no debt here to be collected.
I don't want no part.

How many times do I have to say it.
You used to be smart.
I'm not affected.
You've been rejected.
And I don't want no more.

You used to walk.
And I got weak.
I used to tremble from your speech.
You used to get up in my head.
When you crawled into my bed.

You had me thinking stupidly.
Like you and I would someday be.
But that's just it, baby.
I'm not affected by you, baby.

You don't make or break me, baby.
Maybe you just can't tell.
I'm not under your spell no more.

I've become immune to you.
You so used to running back.
But I won't let you do that.
