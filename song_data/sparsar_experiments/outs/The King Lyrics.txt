The King Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

I saw heaven standing open there.
And there before was the One who is faithful and true.
Born this day the Christ of our age.
His life bringing death to sin.
Death to sin.
This war on sin and death.
Has seen its final breath.
Our King has come to bring us life.
Born in secret and not to fame.
The greatest gift was hearing Your name.
Born of this day the Christ of our age.
The Word becoming flesh and blood.
The one Messiah of grace and truth.
The angels singing glory and praise.
This war on sin and death.
Has seen its final breath.
Our King has come to bring us life.
The angels of heaven were singing His praise.
For the Messiah had come and in a manger He lays.
You left Your throne on high to live with this fallen race.
To answer this age old cry We need Your grace! We need Your grace!
Of the wicked redeemed, a need for a King.
To seek and save the lost.
Humbly You came to serve.
This grace we do not deserve.
To take on our sin, Ye righteous and pure.
You came knowing the full cost.
The wise and meek had traveled with gifts of offering.
But what could they give to the King of Kings?
Death meeting defeat with a love that will not cease.
Glory to the King who has bought our peace!
The Light of life brings death to sin and offers up His grace.
With meager cries exalt His name be heard by every race.
All hail the King! All praise the Son!
The Prince of Peace, the Chosen One.
The King above all Kings!
All hail the King! All praise the Son!
The Prince of Peace, the Chosen One.
The King above all Kings!
