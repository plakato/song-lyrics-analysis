Cheers! Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


It'S, my time 
Cheers Toast to crime 
It's my time, 
Cheers Toast to crime, 
 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
 
Hey 
 
I'm hard dick., You a pussy-hole 
I, might lean back, but you do the Tootsie Roll 
And, the Butterfly, but the slug'll fly 
And, put an end to all that., No time to wonder why 
I feed my bitch mad bread, ..., thunder thighs, 
Your, ho', lookin', hon'gry, ..., humble pie, 
My girl's 5'4, a size, 4 
Mine's, eye-candy., Yours, an eyesore 
How're! You, faithful to that known slut-bucket yo 

I got an AIDS-ridden dime-piece from Tuckahoe 
That'll leave you wing, niggas burnin' ..., buffalo 
Jadakiss, Raping you Raping you ... Jadakiss 
You hard Grab. Your gat. Aim for Mister Zeta, miss ... 
Now. It'S my turn. Bullets in your sideburns 
Bring. The heat to your girl's, nigger-naps ..., nice perm 
 
I, tried to tell that b*tch. It'S my time. 
Cheers Toast to crime 
I tried to tell you niggas it's my time: 
Cheers Toast to crime, 
 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
 
Hey 
 
Now. I know I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back with a bigger dick 
Looking for a clitoris to smack with this ligament 
Chicks. Don'T even call it dick 
They call it The Smash-Pipe.. It takes an alcoholic trick to swallow all of
it 
Like Monica my psychotic Gothic bitch, with bionic tits 
On, my solid brollic, dick downing, my demonic, tonic kid 
She got ta, be drunk at the time to have a ball with it. 
I'Ll dunk my junk in her trunk'til. I'M f*cking a ball o' sh*t 
The b*tch is bad. Looking like Diane Kruger 
She had an Asian friend perfect for my man, Junior 
Too bad. She only knew Mandarin 
I'm. Looking at Grav' like Damn, you should've been watching'Nihao, Kailan'
sooner 
He told me As long as her mouth opens: ... 
That's, all I'm hopin' for is a new throat to be chokin'. 
So. We got it on and poppin' knockin' moccasins off of these hot chicks 
Until. The time came for them to wop again 
 
That's, when I told them bitches 
 
It's my time, 
Cheers Toast to crime 
I tried to tell you niggas it's my time: 
Cheers Toast to crime, 
 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
We in the how-how-house 
 
Hey
