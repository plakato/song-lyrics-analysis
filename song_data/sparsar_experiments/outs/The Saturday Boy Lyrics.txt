The Saturday Boy Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

I'll never forget the first day I met her.
That September morning was clear and fresh.
The way she spoke and laughed at my jokes.
And the way she rubbed herself.
Against the edge of my desk.
She became a magic mystery to me.
And we'd sit together in double history twice a week.
And some days we'd walk the same way home.
And it's surprising how quick.
A little rain can clear the streets.
We dreamed of her and compared our dreams.
But that was all that I ever tasted.
Cause she lied to me with her body you see.
I lied to myself 'bout the chances I'd wasted.
The times we were close.
Were far and few between.
In the darkness at the dances in the school canteen.
Did she close her eyes like I did.
As we held each other tight.
And la la la la la la la la means I love you.
She danced with me and I still hold that memory.
Soft and sweet.
And I stare up at her window.
As I walk down her street.
But I never made the first team.
I just made the first team laugh.
And she never came to the phone.
She was always in the bath.
I had to look in the dictionary.
To find out the meaning of unrequited.
While she was giving herself for free.
At a party to which I was never invited.
I never understood my failings then.
And I hide my humble hopes now.
Thinking back she made us want her.
A girl not old enough to shave her legs.
