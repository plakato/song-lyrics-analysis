How Many Times Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


How many times I find myself wandering.
How many times I slip away.
How many times I find another way.

How many times I find myself wandering.
How many times down this road.
How many times I find it's time to go.

So many times I'll never know.
So many times you got to let it flow.
So many times I guess you'll never know.
So many times you got to let it show.
