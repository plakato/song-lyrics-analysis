Angel of Mercy Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Coating evil plans in a world of shaking hands.
Trying hard to feed the fire, keeping strife alive.

Man kept in the dark.
With the force of breaking hearts.
Quarrel of every kind.
To confuse and twist the mind.

Pre:.
Silver shiny wings bathed in fire.
Godly weapons speak to break the chains of darkness.

Angel of mercy won't you spread your wings?
Flying high on a silverclouded beam.
Angel of mercy won't you cut that strings?
That feeds the dark and keeps the world in chains.

Lies of deepest dye, no need to reason why.
Manipulating rules, enslaving common sense.
Forcing upon all man their evil bullshit then.
Court jesters never reign, they die away in pain.
