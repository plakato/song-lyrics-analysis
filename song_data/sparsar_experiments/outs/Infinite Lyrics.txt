Infinite Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


Oh God why me, that's the song that the world sings.
Tell the truth but be careful how you word things.
They say cause people ain't ready.
But I know the same soul control your brain jelly.
So I aim steady, ignorance remain deadly.
The kingdom is within so real kings ain't petty, get it?
I don't need ice water, it's fine.
Much rather learn how to turn water to wine.
Yea, and we still in the club.
Sittin back, sippin yac, just feelin the love.
While the DJ do his thang, universal language.
Feel the bass, let it transcend your anguish.
I'll be watchin from a booth in the back.
Seein people change clothes ‘cause the truth is back uh.
You're infinite, don't need rims spinning to feel it.
No amount of sinning can kill it uh.

You're infinite, don't need rims spinning to feel it.
And no amount of sinning can kill it, uh.
You're infinite, don't need rims spinning to feel it.
And no amount of sinning can kill it, uh.
You're infinite, yea you're infinite.
Now take a couple of seconds to feel it.
You're infinite, yea you're infinite.
Now take a couple of seconds to feel it.

They got a lot that they can say and do.
To try to make it seem real but that don't make it true, nah.
What makes it true is when they get you.
You and me to believe in it and then relay it to.
The next man that spread their lies like a bad disease.
Infecting everybody's minds, we all casualties.
Now we're so overwhelmed that we can't conceive a better life for ourselves or.
our families.
So these days I'm tryna narrow down my focusing.
Concentrate on the folks that I hold close as kin.
Keep dwelling on everything that I think is wrong.
‘Cause in the end when you blink it's gone.
And it's your energy that lingers on.
And I believe that it's your memories you bring along.
So every friend, every enemy, you bring em all.
Yea, so they can try their best.
But can't control what's behind the flesh.
Don't stress.

You're infinite, don't need rims spinning to feel it.
And no amount of sinning can kill it, no.
You're infinite, don't need rims spinning to feel it.
And no amount of sinning can kill it, uh.
You're infinite, yea you're infinite.
Now take a couple of seconds to feel it.
You're infinite, yea you're infinite.
So take a couple of seconds to feel it.
