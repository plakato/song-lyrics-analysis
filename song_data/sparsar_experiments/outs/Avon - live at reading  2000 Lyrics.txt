Avon - live at reading  2000 Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.

I seen you go.
Through a park in a haze.
And I don't listen.
For traffic going the same way.
A simple system.
Yeah.
I string 'em up, I cut 'em down.
And dare I say.

A perfect vision.
Such simple ways to let you know.
Free range humans.
All cooped up, naked clone.
Is playing lame.
Yeah.
I string 'em up, I cut 'em down.
And dare I say.
