Empty Cell Lyrics
by Rusty.

Pam says she loves me.
I'm lucky.
Guys like me, don't get laid.
By girls like her.
By girls like her.
She says we'll be together now.
Sittin alone in my empty cell.
She says she needs me.
I picture her face no more.
She don't call.
After all I've done.
All I've done for her.
She says we'll be together now.
Sittin alone in my empty cell.
My heart is broken, I can't hear a sound.
Sittin alone in my empty cell.
My skin crawls, I killed him.
I'd do it again if I thought I Could spend the rest.
Of my life with her.
My life with her.
She says we'll be together now.
Sittin alone in my empty cell.
My heart is broken, I can't hear a sound.
Sittin alone in my empty cell.
