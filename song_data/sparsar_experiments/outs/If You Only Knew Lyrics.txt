If You Only Knew Lyrics
by Yung Berg.


Yung Berg.
Casha.
Let's go.

So many times.
You and I.
Makin luv through the night.
The way that you make me feel.
From the wrong to the right.
All the pain you and I.
You know dat I'm down for real.
If you.
If youthe things you can make me do.
If you.
If you.
The way dat I feel for you.

Yung Berg:.
It goes fressher than whoever.
Shawty you a star.
Must of fell straight from heaven.
She landed in my car.
Standin by the bar.
Conversation smart.
Felt like my first time.
Hittin 106th in park.
Back ?
Legs super thick.
You know the type you can't wait to go spread apart.
Had her from the start.
Took it to the waist.
Where her top came down.
For I throw it out of car.
And still to this day.
I hop into the gucci man.
Records on the radio.
Like I'll do anything.
So tell me what am I to do.
I know this song changed.
So I let this song play.
Yea show cancelled the first season.
No martin no gena.
Yes only diddy.
For you mami.
I'm right here will you need to be.
And when I lost you I lost a piece of me.
