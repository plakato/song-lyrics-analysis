He was our boy Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Dental tools across the floor lie inert and flecked with blood.
I see, and you're humming while you wait.
They call you up and mispronounce your name.
So it's all the sweeter.

He was our boy.
Now he's a dentist.
Our little champion.

Now spit, go wash your face.
Your next appointment is in four months' time.

He was our boy.
Now he's a dentist.
Our little champion.
Our big mistake.

What did we ever do?
Raised him right, paid him attention.
How?

How many times can he stop?
How many days how many months?
Stop.

Stop.
