Fools like us Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

We go out hunting muses in the early morning dew.
The empty lot behind the new development will do.

And try to pretend it's not all gone.
Oh fools like us just don't belong.
Yeah fools like us just don't belong.

You enjoy the comforts but you claim not to partake.
You search for authenticity til you become a fake.

Ya think you'll find salvation in a song.
Oh fools like us just don't belong.
Yeah fools like us just don't belong.

Let us sing our solitudes til all throats soar.
All that we inspire are broken hearts.
But if it doesn't bleed.
Then what's good it for.
When everything's made to fall apart?

So force your heart to fall in love.
Just to feel it break.
And look down on everyone.
Like they were your mistake.
Oh the road to Calvary is mighty long.
And fools like us just don't belong.
Oh fools like us just don't belong.
Yeah fools like us just don't belong.
Wuh!
