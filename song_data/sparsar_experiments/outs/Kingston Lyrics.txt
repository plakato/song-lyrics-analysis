Kingston Lyrics
by Twisted Minds.


Dream.
Right, right, right.
Yeah hol' up, hold' up.

Yeah, what you know about my dream?
Even though it's not about me, yeah my name is Dash D.
You could call me Dee Dee.
But I'm like Dexter working in the lab with my team.
They be like Dash try a ting.
Could you, could you chill.
Khalid got the whip but he probably got his chick.
Naj got the girls and Domo got the drinks.
Pull it.

When you talk about a team, you talk about a dream.
You talking ‘bout ours.
No we don't like tricks, no we don't save chicks.
Cause we don't have powers.
Why you talking 'bout your crew they ain't sick like ours.
I don't want no spotlight on me.
Hit the floodlights for the team.
Hit It!

My team over everybody.
My team, my team.
My team over everybody.

This a first off thing put your work off then.
If you a bitch nigga take your purse out and put some make up on.
Workout and get thin.
Pardon my realness.
Only ride with certified niggas like Meile, Zac, Zone &amp; KinDah.
When this beat drop heads bounce like Tigger.
Rolling down the Boulevard just me and my niggas.
Me and my niggas pulled up on the scene and you figured that your.
Team's ill.
Mine's sicker.
Showed up at the party late last night.
Brought one bottle but I left with five.
Because I dress bummy all I see is eyes.
But why the spotlight on me?

You never heard me the first time B?
Hit the floodlights for the team.
Hit it!

My team over everybody.
My team, my team.
My team over everybody.

Who the clique you don't know ‘bout?
Who the clique who done rolled out?

Ain't no thang for me to just call the crew.
And hit a nigga who done hold out.
At this point it's just about booze and girls with tattoos.
I heard that they loose.
When they get the juice, I hop in this booth.
And pray to God that all my niggas come through boi.

When you talk about a team, you talk about a dream.
You talking ‘bout ours.
No we don't like tricks, no we don't save chicks.
Cause we don't have powers.
Why you talking 'bout your crew they ain't sick like ours.
I don't want no spotlight on me.
Hit the floodlights for the team.
Hit It!

My team over everybody.
My team, my team.
My team over everybody.

My team, my team yeah.
My team, my team yeah.
Sometimes I feel so down.
I feel like I'm rowing upstream.
They try to take my fight.
But I'll always have my team.
