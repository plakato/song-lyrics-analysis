Boys Don't Cry Lyrics
by XOV.


Tell me why you're running from me: 
Is it love or money 
Tell me why you shot right at me. 
Can'T you see, I'm happy 
Is. It love or money 
, 
Like ak47 with words semi-automatic 
Shoot shoot where it hurts 
Right in the bullseye 
Man up man up 
Boys, don't cry- nah, nah, nah, nah 
Boys, don't cry- nah, nah, nah, nah, 
, 
My, best friends turned to demons. 
Family left me beaten 
Now was that love or money 
You won't believe where I found freedom, 
On, the bottom of the sea and 
Without love or money 
 
Like ak47 with words semi-automatic 
Shoot shoot where it hurts 
Right in the bullseye 
Man up man up 
Boys, don't Cry- nah nah nah nah 
Boys, don't cry- nah nah, nah, nah, 
, 
Interlude 
Boys, don't cry- nah, nah, nah, nah 
Boys, don't cry- nah, nah, nah, nah, 
 
Boys, don't cry
