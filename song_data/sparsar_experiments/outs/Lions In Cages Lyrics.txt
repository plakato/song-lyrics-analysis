Lions In Cages Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Lions In Cages.

In the city.
Where I'm from.
There are lovers till the dawn.
And you stayed up to see the sun.
I couldn't wait that long.

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?
Who's gonna get up after we've fallen?
Who's gonna pick up what we've done wrong?
Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

In the city.
Where I'm from.
Lions in cages just for fun.
But you will pace around your cage.
And wait for night to come.

In the city.
Where I'm from.
They shoot you down.
If you run.

But we don't stop to check the time.
Cause time keeps moving on and on and on.

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?
Who's gonna get up after we've fallen?
Who's gonna pick up what we've done wrong?
Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

I see you in another place.
I expect a familiar face.
The city joins us with hands of grace.
Hands free there are no constraints.
Just ignore all that you see.
The illusion of you and me.
Illusions come illusions go.
And if I leave you'll never grow old.

In the city.
Where I'm from.
There are lovers till the dawn.
And you stayed up to see the sun.
I couldn't wait that long.

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?
Who's gonna get up after we've fallen?
Who's gonna pick up what we've done wrong?
Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

The city joins us with hands of grace.
Hands free there are no constraints.

Illusions come illusions go.
And if I leave you'll never grow old.
