Coldest Days Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Well oh lord it's tearing us apart.
Winter love is holding onto your heart.
And I would never be the one to starve.
The Winter love that's holding onto your heart.

I held you in the coldest days.
I held you in the coldest ways.
I never know what will start to pick up and change.

And our love is locked in an empty home.
In creaky chest pumping through an empty stone.
And I would never be the one to hold.
Your creaky chest holding an empty stone.

Our love was holding on through the frost bitten dawn.
I never know what will start to pick up and change.
I held you in the coldest days.
I held you in the coldest ways.
I never know what will start to pick up and change.
