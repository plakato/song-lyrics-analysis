Don't Call Me Scorpion Lyrics
by Sydney.

Look at the world around.
I'm such a shattered disappointment.
And all the love I've found could never be the love I've wanted.
And I know I'm just afraid.
If there's a chance somehow that I could ever make this better.
Give me the chance right now cause I'll be there till forever.
And I know that I'm just afraid that if I give you everything I have you'll.
throw it all away.

And I'll crawl right in through your window.
Don't say your sorry tell me something I don't know.
Crawl right in through your window.
Don't say theres nothing wrong.

I take it all back now.
I have never felt much better.
And giving you up somehow has helped make things so much clearer.
And I know I'm just afraid.
That if I give you everything I have you'll throw it all away.
So I'll be brave, yes I'll be brave.

And I'll right in through your window.
Don't say your sorry tell me something I don't know.
Crawl right in through your window.
Don't say theres nothing wrong.

Yes It's okay that there is something to fix all that you've burned into my.
brain.
But it's okay cause I'll be brave.
But if you really need to get up there, does he still know my name?
I'll be brave yes I'll be brave.

And I'll crawl right in through your window.
Don't say your sorry tell me something I don't know.
Crawl right in through your window.
Don't say theres nothing wrong.
Crawl right in through your window.
Don't say theres nothing wrong.
Crawl right in through your window.
Don't say theres nothing wrong.
