Lyrics.

They treat us like some fools ... you ain't even know it.
They closing all of ours schools ... you ain't even know it.
They killing us in these streets ... you ain't even know it.
They posioning what we eat ... you ain't even know it.
They treat us like some fools ... you ain't even know it.
They closing all of ours schools ... you ain't even know it.
They killing us in these streets ... you ain't even know it.
They posioning what we eat ... you ain't even know it.

Everybody in the government , wanna fuck around kill my people ... like ....
like.
We don't know what the fuck its like ... like.
They do it down low, right, right.
I'm the muthafuckin light, light, light.
Do it till the day I die, die, die.
We just wanna kill the pain, that's why,.
We just get high, high, high.
Its madness, organics ... plastics &amp; acid.
Fuck all they system! they killing the passion.
Killing the spirit, I'm serious they laughing.
Coming to get me? I'm blasting these bastards!
I'm teaching my people, I'm reaching people I'm loving my people , they.
druggin my people !
They killin us all, laughing it off.
Look us at all, up in the mall.
Buying the Jordans &amp; having a ball.
They plotting, they plan &amp; selling it all.
Mi gente ... subanse la mente.
Estos algo nuevo para los que no entienden.
Si quieren algo nuevo, hagan me el presidente.

They're flying all around you ain't even know it.
They're watching us from afar you ain't even know it.
They're planning to attack you ain't even know it.
What happened in Roswell you ain't even know it.
They're flying all around you ain't even know it.
They're watching us from afar you ain't even know it.
They're planning to attack you ain't even know it.
What happened in Roswell you ain't even know it.

Roswell crash government cover up/ left us hanging Naw they don't really give.
a fuck/ they don't wanna speak about/ a little alien peaking out/ lights.
beaming out/ we're not alone its quite the opposite/ if you don't believe me.
man, I ain't even knocking it/ Egyptians believed it/ the Mayans perceived it/.
it's 2013 how come we don't retrieve it/ you ain't even know they flying.
around/ until they touchdown/ and start tying us down/ taking over the earth.
cause we were fucking around/ now the humans are found/ six feet in the.
ground/ I ain't talking fake shit just speaking out loud/ real motherfuckers.
know what I'm talking about/ run in ya house/ sit on the couch/ motherfuckers.
are oblivious to what's happening now/ telescope in my hand man I'm checking.
them out/ I'm checking them now/ cause if they come I'm taking them out/ maybe.
that's the reason I rap like I'm abducted/ came from mars motherfuckers are.
feeling upset/ I know their out there I ain't giving up yet/ tv and news man I.
don't even trust it/ walking among us you ain't even know it/ walking among us.
man you ain't even know it!

They treat us like some fools ... you ain't even know it.
They closing all of ours schools ... you ain't even know it.
They killing us in these streets ... you ain't even know it.
They posioning what we eat ... you ain't even know it.
They're flying all around you ain't even know it.
They're watching us from afar you ain't even know it.
They're planning to attack you ain't even know it.
What happened in Roswell you ain't even know it.

Obama's just like Bush .... you ain't even know it.
La gente tiene el poder ... toda via no saben.
Monsanto's killing us all .... you ain't even know it.
WorldStar ain't hiphop ... you ain't even know it.
Most rappers full of shit .... you ain't even know it.
Tv's the real trap ... you ain't even know it.
El radio vale mierda ... toda via no saben.
CS, we the truth .... you ain't even know it.

They're watching us from afar you ain't even know it.
They're planning to attack you ain't even know it.
What happened in Roswell you ain't even know it.
They treat us like some fools ... you ain't even know it.
They closing all of ours schools ... you ain't even know it.
They killing us in these streets ... you ain't even know it.
They posioning what we eat ... you ain't even know it.
