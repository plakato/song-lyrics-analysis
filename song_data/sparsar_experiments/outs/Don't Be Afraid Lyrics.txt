Don't Be Afraid Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

Mmmm.
Okay.
Du dududu do do doooo.
Ahh here I come, the merchant of dirt.
And here to convert the worthless birds that chirp.
Come get your just deserts.
And discuss your worth.
Or just cuss your words.
And discuss the herd.
Plus the verbs of any war minds.
Justice served and we don't have any more time.
I find my self in truth and honor.
Got on bullet proof armor wherever you wander.
Ponder on soliloquies of stupidity.
The epitome of misery that never needs company.
Somebody stop me from settin' shit straight.
And investin' my faith in a profession of rape.

Come on feul the fire, crucify.
'fraid you might lose an eye.
Do and die suicide.
Lucky where you crucified.
Live a lie foo.
All your life fool.
We all want the nice schools.
We all want the right moves the nike shoes.
We all want the same tricks same clothes same wits.
We all speak the same flow same old same shit.
Why?
Cause things never change.
Noose smotherings for ya blue collar chains.

Don't be afraid.
It's all make believe any way.
Ya we can leave any day.
Keep the faith.
Despite what you hear people say.
Because the fears keep us chained.
Don't be afraid.
It's all make believe any way.
Ya we can leave any day.
Keep the faith.
Despite what you hear people say.
Because the fears keep us chained.
The fear keep us chained … but don't be afraid.

Okay.

Come on.
Who's the liar.
Testify scared to try.
Risk the fight.
Stakes are high make your life.
Through and through just what you like.
You got the right to.
Speak your mind dude.
We all have these strict rules.
All have these shit blues spit fumes.
All have the same myths same doubts same trips.
All work the same shifts for same old same pricks.
And it's only justified in blindfolded eyes.
Stiff suits and ties.

Ahh here I stand.
Observin' this circus.

I'm with ya trust me sir.
Muster up the nerve.
Up we must be sure justice must be served.
Plus we work through plenty hard times.

I find my wealth in the hearts and minds.
Of those of you who truly understand our design.
Dine on the trinity of faith and hope and love.
Though the buzz believe in they can open up.
Know enough to know we don't know enough so hold up.
Don't let lies control us, fuck no.
With every day another page is turned.
Another way to earn your wages on your patient.
Every place we go is state affirmed.
Speak the truth as we know it to whomever it may concern.

Don't be afraid.
It's all make believe any way.
Ya we can leave any day.
Keep the faith.
Despite what you hear people say.
Because the fears keep us chained.
Don't be afraid.
It's all make believe any way.
Ya we can leave any day.
Keep the faith.
Despite what you hear people say.
Because the fears keep us chained.
Chained.

I don't wanna um depress you or frighten you.
And maybe I do…
But only if we can move out of that depression or that uh um fear.
And recognize that there are ways.
To make a difference here.
