Nicki, Minaj, 
Hi 
Chimpanzee's is hatin', but I take it all in stride. 
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side 
Told, you they'd, revive you sorry, but somebody lied. 
I ain't, talking poultry. When I say this, chicken's fried 
Anyway Britney why they so jealous that you teamed up with me 
Tell'em they, my son, yup, yella, I'mma, pick me 
Anyway, burned, whats that I don't know femme fatale, 
Sniff sniff cries. I done slayed your whole entire f**kin' life 
Oh! Oh, you got them out, 
I done balled all day. You ain't touch the court 
What. What you tired, you need! A break. 
You was hot. When Ricki Lake 
 
Britney 
I notice that you got it 
You notice that I want it 
Know that I can take it to the next level baby 
If. You understood this. This is the remix 
Baby. Let me blow your mind tonight: 
 
Nicki, 
It's, Britney, bitch, 
I'm, Nicki Minaj and that's Ke $ ha

Take. No more 
Never felt like felt like this before 
C'mon get me. Get me on the floor. 
Dj. What you, what you waiting for? 
 
WOAH? Oh, OH, OH, OH, OH WOAH! Oh, OH, OH ..., 
WOAH! Oh, OH, OH, OH, OH WOAH! Oh, OH, OH ..., 
 
Watch me move when I loose when I lose it hard 
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark, 
You notice. What I'm wearin' 
I notice you starin 
You, know that I can take it to the next level baby 
Hotter than the A-List 
Next one on my hitlist 
Baby. Let me blow your mind tonight: 
 
Ke $ ha 
I can't take it. Take it 
Take, no more 
Never felt like felt like this before 
C'mon get me. Get me on the floor, 
DJ. What you, what you waiting for,

See, the sunlight, 
We ain't, stoppin', 
Keep on dancing till the world ends 
If, you feel it let it happen.
