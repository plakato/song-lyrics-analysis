Sky Is The Limit Part II Lyrics
by Swych.

Sample from The Notorious B.I.G.'s Sky Is The Limit 
 
Yeah Uh, 
Young dude, with a few things going for him, 
Couple haters grillin'. They ain't, no George, Foreman 
They ain't, no one with that kind of money. 
Must admit for some broke jokers. You act kind of funny about a 
Little boy in a big world with bigger dreams, 
Who's visions reach infinity when the kid asleep 
Want my name set in stone as the best there be 
'Till, my name set in stone with a rest in peace, ..., 
 
I'd, Like to take this moment right here to say rest in peace, Jason, Glass 
I got you, man F2D forever ... 
Alright, uh, yeah, haha eww 
 
Perseverant, but they don't want to hear it. 
The hate is motivation. I put it in my lyrics 
And. It was all a dream: Listenin' to Biggie. 
The sky is the limit they trying to give me a ceiling 
I'm trying to hop in that drop. Top'Ghini banging that Weezy 
And blow up like a C4 before I die 
I'ma cop, my momma, a ride. 
I know I can get that Naserati 
Why. I keep talking about whips. I belong in the clouds. 
And I'ma bring up everybody holding me down 
That's that F2D. Until I'm up there with Jay 
Let, my dreams grow wings up up
