Arab Money Lyrics
by Wordplay.


I woke up on a jet headed to the desert sands.
Where these niggas drive ‘Rari's, own oil, and hella land.
Yeah I'm the man, yeah I'm the man.
Riding in a police Aventador I feel like the man.
Got a $100,000 here and you're considered poor.
Ice cold diamonds on, touch my lips, I'll get a cold core.
In my fresh ass thwab hotter than a damn furnace.
And I'm watching Lewis Hamilton in the Yas Marina Circuit.

Ain't no gang banging, only money slangin'.
Taking trips ‘cause gas is only a dollar a gallon.
Just bought me a donkey and I bought me a stallion.
Doing the medieval saltarello and they call me Italian Stallion.
Arab money greater than US money.
Fuck love I can buy me a honey.
I make it rain everyday, forget about it being sunny.
Flossing on my haters from Monday to Sunday.

I bought every kind of ‘Rari, and every kind of Audi.
Your outfit's looking gaudy and my linen from Saudi.
My shy girl's a little naughty and her pussy is getting disembodied.
Eating Rich Arab Flakes but my goat's milk is soggy.
All around the region banging all the baddest bitches.
Taking pictures with their leaders and millionaires like Regis.
Driving Zondas and buying condos and penthouses.
Yeah I know I'm dreaming, but imma live like this.
