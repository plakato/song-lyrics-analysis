Alienized Lyrics
by Volbeat.

I like to be me, but that's not to be.
I just wanna find the way to get home.
Before I get old, but where is the light.
I wash my rusty burning glory.
That never ever fit.
To take it easy is not that easy.
When time is a bitch.

What you see here, is what you get here.
I just wanna find the way to change it.
The way to accept it, but when is my time.
I wash my rusty burning glory.
That never ever fit.
To take it easy is not that easy.
When time is a bitch.

Well, I feel that I don't belong here.
Alienized in a world of nothing.
Don't we all like to be just ourselves.
Forced to be socialized for money.
Couldn't care less for jobs I've been in.
Well one day I will go the rock n' roll way.

I'm alienized, I'm alienized.

Well, I feel that I don't belong here.
Alienized in a world of nothing.
Don't we all like to be just ourselves.
Forced to be socialized for money.
Couldn't care less for jobs I've been in.
Well one day I will go the rock n' roll way.

I'm alienized, I'm alienized.
