Break From Atlanta Lyrics
by 6lack.


That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you.
?

I heard they want war well I got that down.
Gone worry that down.
Would you do it for the camera.
Hollywood a long way from Atlanta.
Yeah I got a little tired of the haters.
Packed up then I hit LA.
Read about pretty little thang.
Oh lord and she make me wanna stay.
But a nigga gotta go now, now.
Am I moving to fast?
Baby do I need to slow down, down.
You ain't never went to sleep.
Work a lil, woke up in the back of a Escalade.
Slindin' through the city runnin' escapades.
Everything I'm doing is destiny.
So I'm at it all day like desperation.
Is he rapper or do he sing.
Is he even human, ima angel you can see them wings.
I live for a lunch on the strip, so casual.
Nights in the lab so magical.
I told her I would stay but I had to go.
But believe I'm coming back right after though.
“Scandal” all day in the “A” baby you can check the catalog.
Invite her over for the foreplay girl gone head get the shower rod.
She a pro on the low don't know why she trying play like an amateur.
Long Beach 4 week then its back to the East.
I'm in Panama then Atlanta y'all.
Riding down Mel Rose in the night time.
Cause girl we never know what we might find.
Same nigga since day one yeah.
Now we out in LA and you got a new playground.
