Down By The Seaside Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Down by the seaside, see all the boats go sailing?
Can the people hear what the little fish are saying?

The people turned away.

Down in the city streets, see all the folk go racing, racing.
There's no time left to pass the time of day.

So far away 6x.
So far 4x.
So far away 4x.
Do you still do the twist?
Do you find you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you, some go twisting every day.
Though sometimes, it's awful hard to tell.

Out in the country, hear the people singing.
Singing about their growing, knowing where they're going.

Sing loud for the sunshine and pray hard for the rain.
And show your love for Lady Nature and she will come back again.
