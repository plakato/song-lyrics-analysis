North Star Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Well our eyes.
Watching the stars one at a time.
I lost the words I'm clutching on your hand tight.
Wear a small sweater and it looks nice.
I never felt better.

Then the North Star.
Guiding us home in your friend's car.
Will we ever take a chance or will we restart?
The sky is a map that's guiding back to my heart.

Then the North Star.
Guiding us home in your friend's car.
Follow the North Star.
It's leading you back into my heart.

And then we're home.
When we hit the city limits don't forget me for a minute tonight.

We're far apart under the same sky.
You're diving in the dark I'm in the city's lights.
Wishing just to see you for another night.

We're looking above for the North Star.
Guiding us home in your friend's car.
Will we ever take a chance or will we restart?
The sky is a map that's back to my heart.

Then the North Star.
Guiding us home in your friend's car.
Follow the North Star.
It's leading you back into my heart.

And then we're home.
When we hit the city limits don't forget me for a minute tonight.

Then the North Star.
Guiding us home in your friend's car.
Follow the North Star.
It's leading you back into my heart.

And then we're home.
When we hit the city limits don't forget me for a minute tonight.
