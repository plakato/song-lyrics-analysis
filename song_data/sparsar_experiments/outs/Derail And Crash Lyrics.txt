Derail And Crash Lyrics
by The Wombats.

I met you four months last Sunday.
My oh my what a happy, clappy fun day.
We started off as jobs in catering.
Had no idea of the pain this cheap pay could bring.

Now that your tickle has become a scratch.
This ghost train will derail and crash.
Like Blackpool's Pepsi Max.
We will derail and crash, derail and crash.

You moved my wardrobe out the front door.
A slight indication of what I've come home, what I'm in for.
You were watching Tarantino loud on widescreen.
I catch your eye and the barrel points at me.

Looks like your tickle has become a scratch.
This ghost train will derail and crash.
Like Blackpool's Pepsi Max.
We will derail and crash, derail and crash.

Derail and crash.
