Twenty Fourteen Lyrics
by A.Belief.


I will never glorify they names.
The cloth from which I came.
Is dampened w blood, sweat, &amp; most of all the pain.
Cause I been pre-approved, my soul been rearranged.
Since I had been detained.

All my niggas they can vibe to this &amp; all the women they can ride to.
this.

Catching the vibes, hands to the sky, beautiful clouds.
Ain't talked to God in so long, I'm prolly hell bound.
Spitting fire w my dogs, like we hell hounds.
I haven't been the same ever since I moved out my hometown.
Still profound w pronouns.
Trying to bloom in the darkest of rooms.
Bringing light to my situation w the darkest of tunes.
These ain't even tracks, just a compilation of moods.
Every day wishing we never see our face in the news.
Tryna decide whether it's worth it, if we win or we lose.
Never feeling a feeling, unless I'm feeling confused.
What do you choose, freedom or shoes, life in the nude.

All my niggas they can vibe to this &amp; all the women they can ride to.
this.
