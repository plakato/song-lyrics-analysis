22'S Spinning

Never mind
What they say
I got 22's spinning
Its about to go. Down
Go down. Go down

I, got 22's spinning
Ice team. Sneakers
Jordan 45 on my back
I got a Mack
Full of bullets
With, your name on it
I blast til, my clip
Is empty
So. Don'T test me
Don't tempt me

Hey wena lova
Yekela omunye wena
Ungmbambi so
Uzomdabulela

I fought hard
I fought, long
I thought ahead
U even broke bread
With the YorkshireFarian
Gods

Smoked herb to see god

Iqude libhensile
Obhare bafihle imisila
Rhyming about Pure
Kuyazila

Phosa Maphosa sibone
Umlomo uchapha
Umfula ugcwele

Never, mind what they
I got 22's spinning
Its about to go. Down
Go down. Go down

After, realising
The, world
Was, crazier, than
I, am
I sort of went all out
Full force at my
Adversaries
Crushing, their anniversaries
Offering them bursaries

School in session
22, niggas gon na die tonight
22s spinning hard
My 2 mack 11s

Make 22 families abafelokazi

Satisfaction is not in my nature

Then. You wrote: yours
Counter attack, rappers
I murder. U all
Summer spring or fall
Trust. My rage
My fury is ancient
I've, been patient

Front row seat
As. I watch ya record label
Burn
To the ground
Another dibby dibby sound
Qubula zonke
Dubula bonke
Nqoba konke sound
It's about to go down
Back to where
The drum, beat lives

It's sound of the beast
22 players in a footie match
Keep, their eyes
On. The same ball
For 90 mins

While millions pay millions
To watch the 22 diving
Tackling scoring
Now. They play my champion. Sound
With 22's spinning

It's about to go down
22's spinning
Never, mind what they say
