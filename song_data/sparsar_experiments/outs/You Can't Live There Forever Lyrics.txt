whole sun out.
It's better than living in the light.
To die over exposed so you fight and that's alright.
You're harmless in your mind.
You're formless in the night.
And that's alright.

What do you think is going right in your life?
What can you know about life if you've never died?

We are as harmless as the thoughts in our heads.
Drinking poison and chewing on.
concrete.
Burning holes in the sheets on our beds.
And we think that the world is alright.
And we think that the world is alright and that's a lie.
