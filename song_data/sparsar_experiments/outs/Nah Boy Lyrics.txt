by Xplicit Entertainment.


Yo yo yo.
So hear what's the scene, nah boy.
I'm right here with my team, nah boy.
Represent for the red, white &amp; black.
Everyday we be living our dreams, nah boy.
So just say what you feel, nah boy.
We just keeping it real, nah boy.
All around the world, they ask us where we're from.
We say T&amp;T, nah boy.

Nah boy, nah boy.
If you're from Trinidad, nah boy.
Nah boy, nah boy.
If you're from Bago, nah boy.
Nah boy, nah boy.
Put your hands in the air nah boy.

Put your drinks in the air nah boy.

So come hear a scene, nah boy.
Allyuh can't never ever beat we.
Our flow's so clean, nah boy.
That's why we GT.
Rappers who have the skill of 6 to 1, that's us in TT.
We're up on the top like beanies.
Other men out of style like BB.
Rudder and Hardy we mash up together like barra and channa.
Men does get jelly like buying a coconut around the savannah.
Find someone who's harder?
You'll come up with nada.
We're the Don Dadas.
You're a bake like sada.

Nah boy, nah boy.

So that's how we do it in Trini.
When the team roll up and you see we.
We let the drop top drop, pull the handbrakes up.
Roll out, let the girls them see we.
You done know, say we fly like BWee.
All our girls are sweet like kiwi.
We come up in the club with we team you know how we do it.
Fabulous like skinny.
We real bad boy, like Diddy.
They feel they're ranking, like Ziggy.
Right now we got the keys to the city.
In the club just keeping it jiggy.
Now the haters them want to be we.
We go hard, and they're just shitty.
We're going to mash up the place.
The girls pelting waist everyday, everynight.

If you're from Trinidad, nah boy.
Nah boy, nah boy.
If you're from Bago, nah boy.
