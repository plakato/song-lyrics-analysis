F Ur Ex Lyrics
by Sway UK.

Speaking.

Oi Oi Babe.

Oi Put It Down Man.

What Are You Hiding?

I'm not hiding nuffin.
Da reason I got a security lock on my phone.
Is cos I got bare celebrities on the phone..

If I lose my phone everybody's f'ed.

But you can talk. Are you still speaking to my man?

Your still speaking to him init.

Sway.
Does my man think I'm a punk.
Diggin you down anytime that he wants.
I said you can have male friends if you want.
But I don't think that's what my mans on.

Real talk, you better tell him that it's long.
If not, you best believe I'll be gone.
What kinda ex would send this text?
I miss you Where's his respect?
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.
Act like it's just innocent.
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.
You don't wanna see me get militant.
What what, now babes am I wrong?
Am I gonna have it though, babes I'm a don.
I'm gonna get wicked if he don't get rid of your digits.
And stop sending you kissing on Facebook dot com.

Why's he ringing you fone.
What does he wants from you.
Don't he know that your not alone?
Swear my mans onto you.

He's just my ex.
He's just my ex.
He's just my ex.
And I think he's cool.

Stush.
Does my girl tink me a dunce?
Belling of ya bloodclaat fone when she wants.
Me a ring ya line an me can't get through.
Am I the one that's been with you for months.
Do you think that I am dumb?
No wait hold on, am I done?
Tell me the truth, am I number one?
Cos right now I don't feel like I'm the one.
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.
I know that your not on the fone to your boy.
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.
Trust I can hear that's a female voice.
No no.
Go away have you fun.
Go go.
To the rave til it's done.
This is not her fault it takes two to tango.
So please don't act like you ain't had a dance.

Why's she ringing you fone.
What does she wants from you.
Tell her your not alone.
I swear she's onto you.
She's just my ex.
She's my ex.
She's just my ex.
And I think she's cool.

Sway.
I'm with you.
I've been true.
Past relationships I've been through.
Loads of stress.
So give me your best.
Cos the truth is, she's just my ex.

Stush.
I'm with you.
I've been true.
Past relationship I've been through.
Loads of stress.
So give me a rest.
Cos the truth is he's just my ex.

Sway.
If my man try to send you another text.
Text him back.
Tell him he should get a vest.
If he ever make you make me upset.
Text him again and tell him he should get a tech.
Cos I like you u know.
Ima wife you u know.
Your not just a link.
Your my wifey you know.
That's likes a life thing you know.
Have a family with you.
That's likely you know.

What you don't think I should fight for you?
No in this new school thing I'm the principle.
Cos the old school says you shouldn't fight over girls.
But the new school do it for the principle.
I know I'm not invincible.
But don't your ex have somethings to do?
I'm only joking.
I ain't gonna smoke ya.
And nobody put no rings on you so do you.

Why's he ringing your fone.
What does he want from you.
Don't he know that your not alone.
I swear my mans onto you.
He's just my ex.
He's just my ex.
He's just my ex.
And I think he's cool.

Why's she ringing your fone.
What does she want from you.
Tell her that your not alone.
I swear down she's onto you.
She's just my ex.
She's my ex.
She's just my ex.
And I think she's cool.
