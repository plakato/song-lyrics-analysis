Awakening Lyrics
by Switchfoot.


Yeah!

Face down with the LA curbside endings.
And the ones and zeros.
Downtown was the perfect place to hide.
The first star that I saw last night was a headlight.
Of a man-made sky but.
Man-made never made our dreams collide.
Collide.

Here we are now with the falling sky and the rain.
We're awakening.
Here we are now with the desperate youth and the pain.
We're awakening.
Maybe it's called ambition.
You've been talking in your sleep about a dream.
We're awakening.
Yeah.

Last week saw me living for nothing but deadlines.
With my deadbeat sky but.
This town doesn't look the same tonight.
These dreams started singing to me out of nowhere.
And in all my life I.
Don't know that I ever felt so alive.
Alive.

Here we are now with the falling sky and the rain.
We're awakening.
Here we are now with the desperate youth and the pain.
We're awakening.
Maybe it's called ambition.
But you've been talking in your sleep about a dream.
We're awakening.

I want to wake up kicking and screaming.
I want to wake up kicking and screaming.
I want to know that my heart's still beating.
It's beating.
I'm bleeding.
I want to wake up kicking and screaming.
I want to live like I know what I'm leaving.
I want to know that my heart's still beating.
It's beating.
It's beating.
It's beating.
I'm bleeding.

Here we are now with the falling sky and the rain.
We're awakening.
Here we are now with the desperate youth and the pain.
We're awakening.
Maybe it's called ambition.
But you've been talk - talking in your sleep about a dream.
We're awakening.
Dream.
We're awakening.
Yeah.
