Alien Workshop ( rare ) Lyrics
by Tyler.

Tyler, The Creator.
Jesus, somebody call my shrink cause i think i'm about to have a fucking.
seizure.

Cause all my brain cells are living single like a deja.
Rapping - stop it.
Open - lock it.
You niggas come short like fucking hobbits.
I kidnapped a manager and robed it.
I choked the motherfucker like batman and Robin.
Then eat batskin and Robin.
My girlfriend Islamic.
Make it eat my pork fork spoon.
In a room with pianos and balloons, i'l walk away with mushrooms.
My girlfriend's a hippy.
I bet i feed that motherfucker lime like i'm britney.
You faggots are sissies.
I'm shitty - y'all pissy.
I run this shit, how the fuck you niggas skip me?
Even emo bitches want to slit me.
I'm a bass drum - kick me.
