Crying in the Rain Lyrics
by A-ha.

I'll never let you see.
The way my broken heart is hurting me.
I've got my pride.
And I know how to hide.
All my sorrow and pain.
I'll do my crying in the rain.

If I wait for stormy skies.
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes.
You'll never know.
That I still love you so.
Only heartaches remain.
I'll do my crying in the rain.

Raindrops falling from heaven.
Could never take away my misery.
Since we're not together.
I'll pray for stormy weather.
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see.

Some day when my crying's done.
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun.
I may be a fool.
But till then, darling, you'll.
Never see me complain.
I'll do my crying in the rain.

Since we're not together.
I'll pray for stormy weather.
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see.

Some day when my crying's done.
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun.
I may be a fool.
But till then, darling, you'll.
Never see me complain.
I'll do my crying in the rain.
I'll do my crying in the rain.
I'll do my crying in the rain.
