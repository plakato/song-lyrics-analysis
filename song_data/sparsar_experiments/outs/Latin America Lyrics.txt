Latin America Lyrics
by Quiero Club.


Yes, I know what happened.
The last time I drove.
Yes, I know what happened.
I can't sing no more.

So, Latin America is hot.
Latin America is hard.
You and me are hot dogs.
You and me are sick fucks.
Latin America's hot.
Latin America's hard.
Latin America's hard.
You and me are hot dogs.
You and me are sick fucks.
Latin America's hot.

Yes, I know what happened.
The last time I drove.
Yes, I know what happened.
I can't sing no more.

So, Latin America is hot.
Latin America is hard.
You and me are hot dogs.
You and me are sick fucks.
Latin America's hot.

Yes, I know what happened.
The last time I drove.
Yes, I know what happened.
I can't sing no more.
