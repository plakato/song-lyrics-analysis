Pray For Me Lyrics
by QuayChronicles.


Pray for me, young man with big plans, 
Billions envisioned but start with less than 10 grand 
What to do Moms needs me. 
My state need me: Hip-Hop, starvin', sayin' feed me 
Enter, my complex, my stress, 
Not concave, ... nah --, more, like it's convex 
Sorry. Let me explain it at its simplest: 
This is my heart ... nah --! This is my art 
My only chance to do. My part, 
Lyrics learn to sew and knit with the hope of 
Gettin' words to stitch and reupholster my culture 
Save more than myself takin'. It further 
And, I can't comeback until we all got 40 acres, 
And the mule's, a Cadillac 
God Bless the day for me, 
And, let the people pray for me, 
 
Look. Anyone can get on mic and rhyme 
But. How many will be remembered in due time? 
Mine Understand that, where I rhyme and where I'm in 
Everything I'm not makes me everything, I am 

To help another person just get through 
A life. They ain't ask for but forced to just use 
Figure my words as your just dues 
So excuse. If the raps aren't in metaphors 
I'd rather speak it plain so more people can feel me more 
Recognize. I don't want to rap to you. 
I'D rather speak it plain so that I can rap through you 
All in hopes that my word connects 
Explains my complex about bein' too complex, 
Cause lyrically. I could be Talib Kweli 
But at the end of the day, who would pray for me?
