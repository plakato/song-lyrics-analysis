Cruisin' Lyrics
by Vixen.

It was earlier tonight, you didn't wanna be alone.
So you put on your best jeans, you picked up your phone.
Then you called every club you knew, to find out what's going on.
As you slipped in your car, the feeling came on strong.

You had to go cruisin' , you had to go cruisin' into wild times.
Cruisin' , gonna ride out to the red light.

You drove off in your fancy little car, you started headin' for the joy.
And you got that feeling again that tonight could be so much more.
You walked in looking for someone, for something to share.
When you walked in, I was already there.

Cruisin' , cruisin' into wild times.
I was cruisin' , gonna ride out to the red light.

Can't you go any faster? - That's better.

I think it's time, yeah it's time we broke the ice.
You know that this sort of thing, it did already happen twice.
I wanna rock, I wanna roll, I wanna eat into your soul.
Just push into the litter, whenever you lose control.

Let's go cruisin' , I wanna go cruisin' into wild times.
Let's go cruisin' , gonna ride it out to the red light.
