Ain't No Fooling Me Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Said, look at the girl.
No, you don't know anything.
Walking through my door.
Yeah, you use your curves to get you anything.

I've seen your game before.
Like a south bound train.
Yeah, you're always going down.
Any fool can see.

You've got a pretty face.
When you blow me kisses.
But you ain't fooling me.
You ain't fooling me.

Cause you're all talk.
But hit me with your best shot.
I know that it's all a lie.
Don't mistake me as one for giving sympathy.

Sugar, now you're out of time.
And I've already read your mind.
Cause there ain't no fooling me.

Rich man, poor man.
Don't really matter.
Any way you get paid.

Put yourself in ice.
It's like walking on water.
But sugar, I ain't afraid.
Cause you ain't fooling me.

Cause you're all talk.
But hit me with your best shot.
I know that it's all a lie.
Don't mistake me as one for giving sympathy.

Sugar, now you're out of time.
And I've already read your mind.
Cause there ain't no fooling me.
No, there ain't no fooling me.

Somewhere underneath that halo.
There's a devil hiding from the truth.
They say that it takes one to know.
And that's why I see a part of me in you.
Whoa, yeah.

Cause you're all talk.
But hit me with your best shot.
I know that it's all a lie.
Don't mistake me as one for giving sympathy.

Sugar, now you're out of time.
And I've already read your mind.
Cause there ain't no fooling me.
No, there ain't no fooling me.

No, there ain't no fooling me.
No, there ain't, no, there ain't.
No fooling me, fooling me.
