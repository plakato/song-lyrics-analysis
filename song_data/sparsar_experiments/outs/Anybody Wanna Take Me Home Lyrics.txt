Anybody Wanna Take Me Home Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

So, I am in the twilight of my youth.
Not that I'm going to remember.
And have you seen the moon tonight, is it full?
Still burning its embers.

The people dancing in the corner, they seem happy.
But I am sad.
I'm still dancing in the coma of the drinks I just had.

Does anybody wanna take me home?
Does anybody wanna take me home?
Take me to your house and I'll leave you alone.
Of course I will.
Of course I won't.
It seems so tragic but it disappears like magic.

Can you recommend an education or drugs.
Because I'm bored with you already.
I'm on Broadway and I think it's a parade.
I'm covered in pieces of confetti.

And I am in the twilight of my youth.
Not that I'm going to remember.
Dancing in slowly and finding the truth.
And it's covered in coma.

All of these people in my life, well they seem so in love.
Well, I am not.
Memorizing my shoes in a cigarette shop.

Does anybody wanna take me home?
Does anybody wanna take me home?
I'm kinda lonely, will you take me home?
Of course you will.
Of course you won't.
Of course I'm crass.
It seems so tragic.
Of course you will.
Of course you won't.
But I'll disappear.
I'll disappear.
Just like magic.
Just like magic.
Just like magic.
