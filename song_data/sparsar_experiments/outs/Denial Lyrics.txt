Denial Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

This.
Huh, ooh!

Took a chance.
And I never thought that I would be here.
But all.
Ohh, saw it in your eyes.
Never realized.
How'd you do me like this.

You said I could change your life.
And you said in time.
It would be right.
And the clocks changed.
It's still on the same day.
It's your loss.
Do what you gotta do.

Are you gonna sit here.
Sit here and live in denial, denial.
Of what we are.
Or are you gonna be a man about it?

Exposed while we out.
That's why they call it denial.
That's why you stay in denial.

That's why I call it denial.
Don't deny us now.
Baby, in denial.
Denial, denial, denial.

So when you came through.
Let me love on you.
That I felt the blue.
And ohh.
Cause I know.
That you coming home so you could conceal the truth.

What happened to you laying up in my bed?
Telling me that you were nothing like them other men.
But you don't beat the odds.
Cause you ripped out my heart.
And you threw it out the window.

Are you gonna sit here.
Sit here and live in denial, denial.
Of what we are.
Or are you gonna be a man about it?

Exposed while we out.
That's why they call it denial.
That's why you stay in denial.

That's why I call it denial.
Don't deny us now.
Baby, in denial.
Denial, denial, denial.

There's no other word for it.
Ohh, think it's best.
That I just pack my feelings up and leave.

I.
I thought that you would be real.
Baby, this ain't even me.
I can't pretend that this is something.
It ain't, ohh.

Are you gonna sit here.
Sit here and live in denial, denial.
Of what we are.
Or are you.
Gonna be a man about it.

Exposed while we out.
That's why they call it denial.
That's why you stay in denial.

That's why I call it denial.
Don't deny us now.
Baby, in denial.
Denial, denial, denial.

Are you gonna sit here.
Sit here and live in denial, denial.
Of what we are.
Or are you  gonna be a man about it?

Exposed while we out.
That's why they call it denial.
That's why you stay in denial.

That's why I call it denial.
Don't deny us now.
Baby, in denial.
Denial, denial, denial.
You can love you, denial.
Denial.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
