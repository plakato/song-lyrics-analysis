MCE (Man Crush Everyday) Lyrics
by SWV.


Wake up and think of you like damn.
What the hell have you done to me now.
Have you seen yourself in the mirror.
Shake my head and look at you.
Perfect picture, perfect picture.
Them other girls they want the pearls.
But fly away, fly away.
That baby, that baby, I been on you lately.

You shot me down.
I go bang, bang.
You ain't know you got me.
You give me butterflies.

They say.
Who got you feeling this way.
Who got you feeling this way.
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Who got you feeling this way.
Who got you feeling this way.
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.

You got exactly what I need.
You know, I want you.

Looking at your pictures.
Wishing I could be with you.
Tell me how long I have to wait.
Baby, make no mistake.

You shot me down.
I go bang, bang.
You ain't know you got me.
You give me butterflies.

They say.
Who got you feeling this way.
Who got you feeling this way.
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Who got you feeling this way.
Who got you feeling this way.
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.

That's my baby , everyday.
Even though I've never seen him face to face.
Love Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
That's about a week to keep that boy.
You give me butterflies.
As it must be your ?
Liking your id pictures.
But I just can't wait to see you.
I don't see nobody.
I'm ? up on the ground.
My girls like hot damn.
You love 'em like that's your man.

They say.
Who got you feeling this way.

Who got you feeling this way.
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.

Who got you feeling this way.

Who got you feeling this way.
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
Man crush everyday.
