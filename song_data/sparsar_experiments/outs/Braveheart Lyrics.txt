Braveheart Lyrics
by United Kingdom.


Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn 
Alone. Among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust greed 
Today. He will murder his brother to possess his brother's land 
Let him not breed in great numbers 
For. He will make a desert of his home and yours 
Shun him, for he is the avenger of death, 
 
Yo, Braveheart verbal courage, battle. The seminar 
Royal Fam Legacy watch us travel far. 
Positive energy always corrects errors, Royal Fam, rulin this 
Now and forever. What 
Play? Your part braveheart play your part braveheart 
Play, your part braveheart play your part. Braveheart 
 
Timbo King Royal Fam, 
Orotorical niggas is metaphorical. 
My editorial breaks down your monuments, historical 
Geologists, studying land using the earth's crust, 
Measurements eight elements, atomic weight, plus density, 
Hi-Techs science, thrustal gravity 
Revolve around my oro, I'm the soul that keeps spinning what 
Supernova black quasar. My mental radar picks up 
Frequencies way beyond the earth's equator. 
Forver glow, electro magnetic force field 
Thoughts build. We bomb for real 36 still exists, 
Golden fist, your caught up in the devil's mist, 
Fire war royal sire laws revealing this 
Protons electrons atoms cause explosions, 
My center of atraction. I'M the nucleus, you're frozen 
My square, be complete architectual visual 
The, sound spectrum strikes the mental. Then the physical 
My perimeter damns your diameter 
Bar codes are scanned from America to Canada, 
What from America to Canada,
