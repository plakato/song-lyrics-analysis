4 A Young Lyrics
by Ty Dolla $ign.


Got another nigga bitch in my bed right now, 
Got another nigga bitch in my bed. Right now, 
She got her legs all up in the air right now, 
But to show her how the dollar sign put it down. 
I'Mma drop an AK in it. Put put it down, 
She, wrapped her arms all
around me 
Licking on my neck and shit. 
She say she want it: missionary 
My hands all on her neck and shit. 
We grinding real, slow, hard like I've been working out. 
She turned around and poke it out. I beat it up like Pacquiao 
 
Oh got another nigga bitch in my bed right now, 
Got another nigga bitch in my bed. Right now, 
She got her legs all up in the air right now. 
She got her legs all up in the air right now. 
For, a young for a young - oh, she do anything for a young 
For, a young for a young. Oh, she do anything for a young 
 
She got the dollar sign tatty and she fucking with the kid 
Her phone blowing up her boyfriend. Wan na know where she is 
He, gon' stress her out, I'mma just stretch his bitch 
Now, his key don't fit call the locksmith 
Hands all on my meat blowing on it tasting it. 
She say she want it: doggie-style 
With my hands all on her waist and shit. 
He blowing up her line texting her, let's stay together, 
She turned it out and poked it out. I beat it up like Mayweather 
 
She, make me say: yeah yeah, yeah, 
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
