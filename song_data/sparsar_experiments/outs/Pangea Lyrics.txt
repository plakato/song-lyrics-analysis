Pangea Lyrics
by A.Belief.


You the reason I don't on love these hoes.
Boy I got golden goals.
Even tho I don't act I rap.
Yeah a nigga want a Golden Globe.
Cause the race ain't been the same.
Ever since the earth unfroze.
I can't complain that I ain't the same.
But at least a nigga got these flows.
Yo yo, this Bas flow,this Nas flow.
This Basquiat, Picasso.
I am not what they are so.
I'm a visionary in cargos.
I don't talk that, I live it.
Everything I say I did it.
Every pic I paint, I witnessed.

Boy I got strippers all on my IG.
Money all in my IV.
And a couple bros that still spit flows.
And they sit close like try me.
Ivy League just ain't for me.
Pray for you,I can't pray for me.
Remember you,I can't remember me.
My brain obtains the necessities.
Let go the past till my phone ring.
Now I'm face to face w the old me.
I'd hate to say that you owe me.
But I'm climbing straight to them nose bleeds.
I see Twerk vids on my timeline.
Shawty bad, summertime fine.
Hit that broad w the same lines.
But I hit that, y'all prolly wine dine.
When I get stacks, she'll be all mine.
Cause money make that world turn.
But money's not my concern.
Christ back, I hope the world burn.
Really I just wan to help the world learn.
This raw talent, raw terms.
All magic, this all work.
This all summer ,this my worth.
