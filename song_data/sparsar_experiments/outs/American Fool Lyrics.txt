American Fool Lyrics
by Work Drugz.


Despite? us cool kids, we couldn't be.
Get by the critics, we don't believe.
Still waiting for something, but what can we do?
Too jaded now to see this thing through.

At 16 and pregnant, American Fool.
Chasing trends, popping pills, I wanna be cool.
Keep on pretending, got nothing to say.
Say it with conviction, believe it everyday.

I just wanna lose one shot?, run if you know what's good for you.

I just wanna lose one shot, run if you know what's good for you.

We're too tired at night, but we can't even sleep.
Too jealous now, i wanna defeat?
Say our love is worthless, so weak.
Anyone, wanna have some fun?

I just wanna lose one shot, run if you know what's good for you.

I just wanna lose one shot, run if you know what's good for you.

They hate us cause they ain't us.
Just one shot, run if you know what's good for you.

I just wanna lose one shot, run if you know what's good for you.

I just wanna lose one shot, run if you know what's good for you.

Better run if you know what's good for you.
