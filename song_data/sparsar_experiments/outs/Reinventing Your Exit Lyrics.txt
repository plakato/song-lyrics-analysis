Reinventing Your Exit Lyrics
by Underoath.


Twelfth and Hide on a Sunday.
Feeling like we're gold.
And we're nothing short of invincible.
Invincible, invincible.

It starts again, can you feel it?
It takes your breath away.
Stop saying that we're invincible.

You're uninviting, unrewarding.
And I'm misinforming you, misinforming you.

We all want to be, want to be somebody.
Right now, we're just looking for the exit.

This is the way I would have done things.
Up against the wall, up against the wall.
You got me up against your wall.

It's you and me on a Monday.
The lies that we told.
This is where we both go numb now.

You broke my heart again this time.
You're fading now, you crossed the line.
You crossed the line.

Reaching out for a hand that's not here.
But you're not there.
