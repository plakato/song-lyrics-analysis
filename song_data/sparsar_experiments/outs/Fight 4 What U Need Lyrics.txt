Fight 4 What U Need Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Give me a corner of your heart to paint.
And i'll be there in the dark of my brain now.
Carve my name x3.
Name x3.

Give me a photo of your soul to take.
And i'll be there in the dark of my brain now.
Burn your name x3.
Name x3.

You know i didn't really need you at all.
I was just passing time.
Just telling why i lie for a while.
I saw you in the dark on your own.
I was lost with the night.
And i'm Not going to leave you at all.

I should have never move your heart on the beat.
There's a tick tack dagger out in reach.
And i walk away.
Walk away x2.
Away x3.

Oh oh waaaaa oooohhh x4.

Get your eyes on the street.
Get you back into the seat.
Am not going to leave you alone.
Get your eyes on the street.
And fight for what you need x2.
