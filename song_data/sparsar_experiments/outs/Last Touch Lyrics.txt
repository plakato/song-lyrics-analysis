Last Touch Lyrics
by Rugz D. Bewler.


Before I dance with the devil.
Just give me give me the money.
Write my name in the books.
Put me to somewhere sunny.
Thinking nobody love me.
Overthinking the only.
Very humble but hungry.
That would always be me.
Always giving my all.
Always give till I fall.
Never down on my knees.
Unless I'm praying to him.
Probably praying to she.
Whatever it just may be.
Religions have been decisions.
Contracts, and critics.
Now who's the fittest?
The last shot on my take.
No luck, chance, no fate.
But wait....
No like fire and will.
Arrogance with the skill.
Going for the kill.

Competition everywhere.
But I don't really care.
Cause I was already one point on the search.
Going for the gold.
Giving all my soul.
Giving till they put me underneath the dirt.

Cause.
There's only really room for.
One love, one queen, one king.
There's only really room for.
One life, one love, one ring.

You could have been a superstar, but now you will never know.
You could have been an astronaut, but now you will never know.
You could have been the president, but now you will never know.
You could have been the end in all.
The greatest of them all.
But now you will never know.

Before you give me my flowers.
Before you give me the love.
Before when I was a nobody.
No one gave a fuck.
Failure isn't accepted.
Going hard is a must.
Always being the leader.
But always screaming that's us.
Marching like we got millions.
Pointing fingers to *?*.
So what, we caught on their feelings.
I got to complete my mission.
On the throne I am sitting.
With the two that I trust.
Tell the coach I can make.
Just give me one try.
One touch.
The last shot on my take.
No luck, chance, no fate.
But wait....
No like fire and will.
Arrogance with the skill.
Going for the kill.

Competition everywhere.
But I don't really care.
Cause I was already one point on the search.
Going for the gold.
Giving all my soul.
Giving till they put me underneath the dirt.

Cause.
There's only really room for.
One love, one queen, one king.
There's only really room for.
One life, one love, one ring.

You could have been a superstar, but now you will never know.
You could have been an astronaut, but now you will never know.
You could have been the president, but now you will never know.
You could have been the end in all.
The greatest of them all.
But now you will never know.
