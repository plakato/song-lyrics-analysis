Mr. Amazing Lyrics
by Wormzz.

Mr Amazing I'm playing across the nation.
Bumping all through yo station.
Great vibes just circulating.
The circulation of breathing music got me so impatient.
Impatiently waiting for the day that I'll turn super saiyan.
But Uh I think I'm slaying.
Uh not on vacation.
But uh I think I'm tripping.
Uh I got em slipping.
Whipping em like they children.
I'm Jordan no Scottie Pippen.
Envision my linguistics.
A genius who's on a mission!
I'm pissing in yo kitchen.
Cuz my pot came up missing.
So tell me where the dishes.
I'm cooking up something vicious.
Wisdom wabbit will nab it.
Dang flabbit habits are tragic.
So talented is this savage.
This rap is infinite package.
Trynna be a legend by tomorrow.
They say I can't.
I'm determined to Prove em wrong though!
I'm so perfect I could kill ether!
300k for a song feature!

So many things that I've created.
But this right here gon' be your favorite.
They ask me who I am Mr. Amazing!
I'm Mr. Amazing.
So many things that I've created.
But this right here gon' be your favorite.

I'm lost in my mind these rhymes are fluent.
I'm spitting on the track the beat slippin on fluids.
Spittin up chunks so much you think I'm puking.
And if they want they action.
These chumps get a hadouken!
Few can loosen my grip.
My rap is tight as it gets.
Enlightenment for you twits.
You dimwits are on my hit list.
About to crackdown tensive.
All about my business.
Gotta lock down penitentiary.
For a century.
Energy.
KILLIN off my enemies.
Ill disease.
Sickened sicken stolen beats.
Livid living lyrically.
Lethally.
Lethal injections so I can kill them off peacefully.
The beast release.
And need to feast.
Exquisitely.
I'm instantly.
Up in Ya face.
Organic fate.
Disregard what they say.
Cuz I'll be great.
And I will play.
On every stage.
Till my dying day.
And to those who hate.
You'll be amazed.

So many things that I've created.
But this right here gon' be your favorite.
They ask me who I am Mr. Amazing!
I'm Mr. Amazing.
So many things that I've created.
But this right here gon' be your favorite.
