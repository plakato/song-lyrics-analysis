Betrayer Lyrics
by Xandria.

This is goodbye.
Once, before ancient times, a circle of knights.
Were sworn to the queen of magic arts.
An oath to usher her daughter to where.
She'd just tear the all apart.
Betrayer, promise breaker, beautiful liar.
In your innocent blue eyed blindness.
Selfish princess, go be unbound.
But you'll burn your wings and hit the ground.
See her beauty so pure.
She seems like the cure.
To all been deluded by her light.
But behind her spell.
We know her so well.
She spoils all for what we fight.
Princess:.
I only want to go where the wind leads me.
And just pick the sweet fruits wherever I go.
So see me now, as I am going to spread my wings!
Knights:.
But it was us who gathered the feathers for you.
It was our promise and you gave yours!
Remember: Your deeds make you what you are, not your intentions.
Don't dare to think we're the ones to be blamed.
Just to feel better in your own betrayal.
We have gone through hell's fire.
Our fate in our hands.
We all claimed this story will not end.
When we heard you say.
You could have hit us even harder.
Go to burn your wings and hit the ground.
Go to hell!
