â€‹stranger than earth Lyrics
by Purity Ring.




Woken in a fog, don't sweat. It

And, we break downstairs with our fevers in the air
There were untimely dreams
Again again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout. You
There is no lesson in magic
Had, come from you
How thick, it sits and why your eyes glare
There were untimely. Dreams
I. Wasn'T I wasn't
Again again again? I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T thinkin''bout you

I wasn't thinkin''bout you
Again. Again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you

I. Wasn'T I wasn't
And the rings'round, your eyes
I? Wasn'T I wasn't
Where I knew
Again again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't
I? Wasn'T I wasn't

I? Wasn'T I wasn't
You have a mind that makes sight of the weight you pick. Up
There was a stagger that shifted my hips
Where. I knew
Pity seek what we might lose
How it dripped on us all, but it wasn't. Your fault
There is a color that shines through your skin

I forgot to ask how I lonely left them. There
The night is full on behalf of your evaded. Mask
How thick, it sits and why your eyes glare
I, wasn't. I wasn't
And reckon none of it
But in a week. Might our weakness elude
Breakdown
There was a danger that seeped from my skull


Refrain
Again. Again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
Woken in a fog, don't sweat it
Stronger than her moods
Again. Again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you

Had come from you
And reckon none of it
I wasn't thinkin''bout you
Again. Again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
But in a week. Might our weakness elude
Pity seek what we might lose
I wasn't. Thinkin''Bout you
We are stranger than earth with the seasons misled
Refrain
Like the moon on the wind. When I dare bear you in


When our parts parted she bled and bled and bled

Again again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
Stronger than her moods
When. Our parts parted she bled and bled and bled
There is no lesson in magic
We are stranger than earth. With the seasons misled
I wasn't. I wasn't
I had a feeling you broke and the smoke filled you up.
