Blue Pail Fever Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

Thy will be done.
Here on this highway.
In every house and field I pray.
All in meekness yield.
Aided by want.
Among stranger people.
To disgrace so soon I've come.

Drift like sleep.
Into the hotel montana.
Lay low for thy names sake.
El matador louisiana.

Full of bulls blood and what not.
Coarse jest to a tight knot.
You are not acquainted with your own heart.
Frozen prayer upon my lips.
Inside the blood runs hot.
He was reviled.
Yet he reviled not.

Like a voice in an empty house.
Breath your breath.
And speak to me.
And speak through me.

It's a dry leaf that shivers on the branch.
What matter if the wind cast it down.
With a ruthless hand.
Cause we remember always.
That it took place forever.
Thy kingdom come in.
Whosoever.
