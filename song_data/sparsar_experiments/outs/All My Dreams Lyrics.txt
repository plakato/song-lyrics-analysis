All My Dreams Lyrics
by ViZion.


Yea yea, check it out.
Huh.

Double up the hustle, I'm turning up the pace.
I've been working in the struggle, I've been trying'a find a way.
The money I'm making is bullshit, but I'm getting a pay back.
Cause the people in the streets feel me, even though I have no Maybach.
And should I say that? I don't really care.
I've been here for a minute, no limit I'm shifting gears.
I'm switching stairs for escalators and elevators.
I'm shifting tears for all my broken dreams and pavements.
Yea, I'm switching up the flow too.
Chilling on the beach with my peeps like we're supposed to.
Yea, cruising coast to coast too, fish up out the sea, breadfruit's gotta.
roast to.
You know whats coming next! Yea we smoke too.
Bob Marley's, Bamboos, no glue.
No apologies, for living up in the minute.
With a feeling undiminished, excuse me while I float through.

I'm making all of my dreams come true.
I'm making all.
Making, making all.
I'm making all of my dreams come true.
Living how I'm living, 'til I fade into the blue.
I'm making all of my dreams come true.
I'm making all.
Making, making all.
I'm making all of my dreams come true.
Until it's Armageddon, we'll be reaching for the seventh heaven.

I'll fly, I'll fly away.
I'll fly, I'll fly away.
I'll fly, I'll fly away.
I'll fly.

And they wanna know, when they see me on the street.
Am I really getting air, like the nikes on my fete.
Is it true, what they say that I'm gonna get a deal?
I'm so unaware, I don't care, that's for real.
Cause we're keeping it indie and I'm smoking like a chimney.
And the fire's kinda hot, you could say we run the rock.
You could say I got lock, like Fort Knox doors.
You could say we fuck the game like it's intercourse.
Notes from Jigga, I'm rocking the heavens well.
Even if they won't let me in heaven, I'm raising hell.
'Til it's heaven. 24/7 I'm a rebel.
When lightning strikes I'm like cold metal.
So cocaine and I'm so propane.
Get a buzz, get a rush, get a cup, get a flame.
No code name, no Cobain.
20/20 is the ViZion, in the eye of a hurricane.

I'm making all of my dreams come true.
I'm making all.
Making, making all.
I'm making all of my dreams come true.
Living how I'm living, 'til I fade into the blue.
I'm making all of my dreams come true.
I'm making all.
Making, making all.
I'm making all of my dreams come true.
Until it's Armageddon, we'll be reaching for the seventh heaven.

I'll fly, I'll fly away.
I'll fly, I'll fly away.
I'll fly, I'll fly away.
I'll fly.

Im' making all of my dreams come true.
I'm making 'em all come true.
You only live once, so that's how I gotta live it, ya know?
246 what up?
ViZion.
It's on to the next, it's on to the cheques.
