Another Man's Done Gone Lyrics
by Woody Guthrie.

Two girls just give me a fountain pen.
I think that's mighty nice.
Reminds me of the joke where the girl.
Give her daddy then pen about twice.

I like the way she looks.
Walks, talks, works, and lays.
I got in trouble over her.
And I'm I'm laying out days.

If you must leave me, if you must leave me here.
If you must leave me, if you must leave me here.
Just leave a cigarette butt, leave a dime for beer.

There's a doctor on my corner.
Great big fat man awful stout.
He makes me give him money.
Just to take my baby out.

I woke up every morning.
With my woman in my arms.
Good girl built like a government mule.
And I'd not do her no harm.

The women know me everywhere I land.
The women know me everywhere I land.
I got more little angels, than you'll find in the promised land.

I'd like to have you around me.
To wake me up every day.
But when my main line comes back home.
I wonder what she'll say.

I got a reputation babe, from coast to coast.
I don't have to tell you no lies.
I don't have to lie nor boast.

The women know me everywhere I land.
The women know me everywhere I land.
I got more little angels, than you'll find in the promised land.
I got more little angels, than you'll find in the promised land.
I got more little angels, than you'll find in the promised land.
