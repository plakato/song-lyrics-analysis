No More Heroes Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


They who hope for a savior, and stand idly by waiting for aid.
Will never rise above this merciless fate handed out to them deemed unworthy.
Lowly pawn, move only when I say.
Sheltered by ignorance, culled by naivet√©.
Cancerous words they all say, just get caught in the way.

No more heroes, no more heroes, no more saviors, no more saviors.
Waiting on you, you're all alone, so hopelessly.

Now we know the story of how they keep us blind to all they do.
Drive us down underwater, drown our hopes, make us believe we're nothing.
without them.
There's no standing in our way, complete supremacy, like puppets on a string.
If you think you can remain, when all others have failed, stand back and watch.
us reign.

No more heroes, no more heroes, no more saviors, no more saviors.
Waiting on you, you're all alone, so hopelessly.

Refuse me; consequence will be your own undoing.
Regret will permeate your soul; exile yourself.

Who are you to challenge us? No one, just turn the other way.
Go ahead I guarantee you'll fall. Not this time the game has changed.
You think that you're special, you're not. You don't define us anymore.
Just try your best to set yourself apart. We already are.

No more heroes, no more heroes, no more saviors, no more saviors.
Waiting on you, you're all alone, so hopelessly.
