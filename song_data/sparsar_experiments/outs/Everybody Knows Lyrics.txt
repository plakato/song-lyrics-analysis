Everybody Knows Lyrics
by Wooden Shjips.

In the bloody moon. Whistling for the road. The honest seen view. The longing.
for home. We're only alone. We're good.
The riders not to lose. The farmer to the two. We're going past is you..
Stinging through the years. Oh day way seen. One buddy.
Only left before. I see you next to me. Takes so alone. It's falling to a.
steer. It's scent in existance. All lonely.
