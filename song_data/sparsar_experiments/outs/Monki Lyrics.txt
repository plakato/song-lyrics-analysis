Monki Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

He wants to give her everything she wants.
All of the sins in her mind.
All of her enemies fallen and cryin'.
All of the tear drops on her tongue.

It's in her conscience.
That whatever god gives.
Her someone to mourn.
Who cares what god is.
Or what a guitar is.
Or that you were born.

Monki.
He wanted you.
Monki.
He wanted you.

And when he stops saying thing you want to hear.
Pull up your knickers in a mood.
He wants to outclass these.
Crass devotees.
Deletes your picture from his phone.

It's in his conscience.
That musical notes give him.
Someone to mourn.
Who cares what god is.
Or what a guitar is.
Or that you were born.

Monki.
She wanted you.
Monki.
She wanted you.
