Beauty Mark Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

I never had it
I never wanted. It
I, never had your beauty mark
Nor did. I have your black hair and hazel eyes
My early childhood
Was, not as simple
As yours set in the country
No. I did not have a fear of nuns who dressed in black
But. I do have your taste

I. Have no radio show
Nor did I have homemade clothes
Homemade curtains of the same material

I never had it
I, never wanted it
I. Never had your beauty, mark
Beauty mark

But. I do have your taste
And. I do have your red face and long hands

I think Callas sang a lovely Norma
You prefer Robeson in Deep River
I may not be so manly
But still. I know you love me
Even. If I don't have your beauty, mark
Beauty mark
