Don't Abuse Me Lyrics
by The Runaways.


Before I was in.
A rock n' roll band.
I couldn't get the time of day.
Now I'm doin' everything I can.
I thought I had it made.
Strangers drop in.
And pretend they're friends.
People I don't even know.
I want you, I need you.
It's so hard to tell.
And what you're really feelin'.
Won't show.

Don't abuse me.
Now you listen to what I say.
If you're tryin' to use me.
Why don't you just go away.

You took me around.
An' you showed me the town.
I thought you were kind of nice.
But if someone stepped in.
With more to show.
You'd drop me without thinkin' twice.
You tie yourself to my apron strings.
Thinkin' your friends will be impressed.
You get your way by bribin' me.
Tellin' me I'm the best.

Don't abuse me.
Now you listen to what I say.
If you're tryin' to use me.
Why don't you just go away.

Who can I trust an' where can I go.
To find someone who truly wants me.
Take me for what I am.
That's the way it's gotta be.
Rock n' roll love you want so bad.
Tellin' everybody you're mine.
But we both know deep down inside.
You're just diggin' for every dime.
