Speechless Lyrics
by Rushlow.

What's a man supposed to say.
When you look at me that way.
There's not a thing about you I would change.
I'm speechless.

You're every classic movie star.
You're every play, you're every part.
You're so deep inside of this man's heart.
I'm speechless.

So, how do I explain to you.
The way you changed my life.
Even if I wanted to.
It wouldn't come out right.

You're every note of every song.
You make right my every wrong.
And in my arms is where you belong.
I'm speechless.
You're a lady through and through.
There's still a little girl there too.
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you.
I'm speechless.

So, how do I explain to you.
The way you changed my life.
Even when I've wanted to.
It never came out right.
Some things are better left unsaid.
And really never heard.
A love that you can recognize.
Without a single word.

So, how do I explain to you.
The way you changed my life.
Even when I've wanted to.
It never came out right.
Some things are better left unsaid.
And really never heard.
A love that you can recognize.
Without a single word.

You make everything stand still.
You complete the way I feel.
And I'll be here for you until.
I'm speechless.
