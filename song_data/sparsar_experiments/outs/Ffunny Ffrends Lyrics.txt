Ffunny Ffrends Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


Don't be surprised if we.
Try to be wise.
Well, love is much more than good advice.

Oh, I rely all of my life.
All of my life.
On my Ffunny Ffrends.
Oh, I rely all of my life.
All of my life.
On my Ffunny Ffrends.

Who gives a damn if we.
Throw the dice?
Well, love is much more than good advice.

Oh, I rely all of my life.
All of my life.
On my Ffunny Ffrends.
Oh, I rely all of my life.
All of my life.
On my Ffunny Ffrends.
