Ice Wharf Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

I was lost on a one way ticket to the house.
Where the drugs are free.
And the lights are down.
You we're waiting on me.
But I was keeping it cool.
The ice breaks beneath and we're falling through.
I, I was getting bit by you.
And you, you we're feeling so brand new.
It's the season, the season for the Camden crew.
It's a snake bite black till you're blue.
We we're trippin' down Chalk Farm Road.
Exchanging glances, feeling so alone.
Neon lights pushing us to the bend.
We're leaving it all at The World's End.
I, I was getting bit by you.
And you, you we're feeling so brand new.
It's the season, the season for the Camden crew.
It's a snake bite black till you're blue.
Losing time the Underground gets cold.
Too late to make it all alone.
Wading through the garbage in the street.
I saved it for you, you saved it for me.
I, I was getting bit by you.
And you, you we're feeling so brand new.
It's the season, the season for the Camden crew.
It's a snake bite black till you're blue.
