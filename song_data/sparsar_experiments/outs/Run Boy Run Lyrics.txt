Run Boy Run Lyrics
by Woodkid.


Run boy run! This world is not made for you.
Run boy run! They're trying to catch you.
Run boy run! Running is a victory.
Run boy run! Beauty lays behind the hills.

Run boy run! The sun will be guiding you.
Run boy run! They're dying to stop you.
Run boy run! This race is a prophecy.
Run boy run! Break out from society.

Tomorrow is another day.
And you won't have to hide away.
You'll be a man, boy!
But for now it's time to run, it's time to run!

Run boy run! This ride is a journey to.
Run boy run! The secret inside of you.
Run boy run! This race is a prophecy.
Run boy run! And disappear in the trees.
