C'est La Vie Way Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Why In your c'est la vie way.
Did you cry, cry, cry.
When you were listening to a mixtape from your friends?

Do you miss them.
In your c'est la vie way.
More than you'd missed me if you'd stayed.
In the hemisphere I asked you to return from?

Or maybe you can pull apart your mind.
Like if there's a Russian doll.
Inside another Russian doll.
You see it all in your c'est la vie way.

So I, I'll try and be a decent partner.
Try to keep the teardrops off your face.
Be kind enough to regard.

In your c'est la vie way.
In your c'est la vie way.
In your c'est la vie way.
In your c'est la vie way.

The ceremony was alright.
But like most ceremonies it.
Lacked a gravity that I.
Would have liked.

There were too many cameras out.
And the microphone gave out as she adjusted her gown.
So the crowd couldn't make out the first half of his busted vows.

You said if you ever leave me I will die.
I could have died it was so cheap.
Oh come on father set us free.
But our hearts fell apart anyway.
When we heard her say c'est la vie.

Oh yes our hearts fall apart anyway.
When we heard her say c'est la vie.
