Can't Nobody Love You Lyrics
by The Zombies.


Can't nobody love you.
Like I'm loving you baby.
Cause they don't know how.
To love you like I do.

Can't nobody love you.
Like I'm loving you right now.
Cause they don't know how.
To love you like I do.

Oh.
I'm going to love you in the morning.
Love you late at night.
I ain't going to stop loving you.
'Til you tell me everything's alright, oh.

Can't nobody kiss you.

Like I'm kissing you right now, little girl.
Cause they don't know how to kiss you, like I do.

And there ain't nobody that can talk to you.

Like I'm talking to you right now.
Cause they don't know how to talk to you, like I do.

Listen now.
Sam bought you cake and ice cream.
Called you cherry pie.
Ray Charles called you his sunshine.
But you're the apple, apple of my eye, oh.

No they don't know how.
To love you.
Like I do.
