Testament of a Soldier Lyrics
by 4th25.

While yall talk shit.
Im too busy to listen.
I don't crack under pressure.
I deal with the friction.

Here its more than opinions.
And though entitled to em.
I don't think yall.
Understand what yall doin.

Or what yall sayin.
Yall got to be kiddin me.
What did yall think it cost.
To be livin free.

So for our country.
We will bleed.
While you run your mouth.
You say in defense of me.

But mofucker please.
You've made your millions.
You could never.
Feel me.

And while yall talk shit.
Understand how that's possible.
We made you rich.
Cause we are willing to die for you.

But yall take that for granted.
So heres a one way ticket.
Anywhere on this planet.

I will not have you talk shit.
While I die for your family.
Protectin our interests.
But you don't understand em.

Built on murder.
Our country's exapanded.
And so far our troubles.
Have rewarded you handsome.

But now you critisize.
The hand that fed you.
And though you try to forget.
No, I won't let you.

And you coulda always of left.
So now im here in iraq.
Wondering whats kept you.

Thinking we'd all be better of here.
Less you.
Opening your mouth.
Against the country that's blessed you.

And we shouldn't be here.
Says you.
But we are.
And you still continue.
To sit.
While we swap spit with these fuckers.
No you don't have to agree.
But you could at least support us.

Stand behind us.
If not for us.
But your too busy.
Runnin your mouth for reporters.

While we here.
Sweatin it out the entire fourth quarter.
And you won't fight.
So we fight for you.

And freedom has a price.
We payin it for you.
The game of your life.
We're playin it for you.

While you shit on everything.
This country's done for you.
Keep runnin your mouth.
Hope the world ignores you.

No you don't speak on our behalf.
We speak for you.
And it's a shame.
You even think you can speak for me.

No I don't see you in the streets.
Bleedin for me.
And until you've walked it.
You can't talk it for me.

We bought your careers.
Fuck have you bought me.
We pay the bills for those.
Opinions you offering.

And we do more than kill in your name.
We slaughter them.
So everyday you can hug.
Your son and daughter again.

But how easily.
You forget what we've done.
And how easily.
When we stand you run.

Fuck is really goin on.
And please when you talk war.
Hold your tongue.

Cause for you to have lived this long.
We have died so young.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
What have you become.

Other than spoiled.
By all the sacrifices we made.
Enjoying life huh?
After the ones we gave.

Where would you be without war.
Yall are so naive.
Only fuckers in the world.
Complaining yall free.
