All My Life Lyrics
by Run the Jewels.


One time for the pill and the reefer, man.
One time for...One time for....
One time for the pill and the reefer, man.
One time for the...One, one-one-one.

One time for the pill and the reefer man.
It's the young black leader to the people, man.
If you're girl's fine, nigga might eat her, man.
I'm talkin' middle of the mall like a pita, man.
A Nigga sky high now like Jesus, man.
And oh Lord this reefer so potent.
Got an anti gravity, a Nigga stay floatin'.
This nigga rob me, bitch you must be jokin'.
Like pow pow pow leave your chestplate open.
One half the best tag team ever.
Them other fellas all right we better.
Anybody disagree they jealous.
And anybody don't just motherfucking yellow.
Fuck a boss I'm the goddamn owner.
And I smell like YSL and marijuana.
Don Draper with the paper might pull a slick caper.
Secretary told me fuck you, I told her you gonna.

And I been this way, shorty.

And I been this way, bitch.

And I been this way, shorty.

And I been this way, bitch.

Sharp like knife.
Bet a buck I'm stuck in the guts of the night.
And I'm.
Please pass that already, alright.
Get fetti, he's steady on the mic.
What the fuck else can he do right?
Step armed heavy and he brought Mike.
Never step light, no fair fights.
We got the drugs y'all wanted.
Take a suck on the tail of a comet.
I'm so high you a hobbit.
Dick level, please back up off it.
Better off dead like Paul is.
Your name don't Ring, go Starrless.
Me and Mike we a friend to the farmers.
The weed run out, we might cop your whole harvest.

Go!
