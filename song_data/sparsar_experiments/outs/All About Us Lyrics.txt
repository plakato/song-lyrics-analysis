All About Us Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


I admit that not a lot of time had passed by.
But we decided that we would be together.
Everybody they talked and had opinions.
They did.

And they had doubts about what we would become.
But I knew you were and you knew I was the one.
Over other people no, we'd never make a fuss.
Cuz it will never be about them, just us.

Nobody but us.
Only me and him.
We're the only ones that matter.
They know what we've got.
Only me and him.
So we never mind the chatter.

What it is that made us feel so good about it.
What it is that made me go half crazy for.
What it is that made him give it all to me.
It's all about us, as long as we know what it is.
That made us feel so good about it.
What it is that made me go half crazy for.
What it is that made him give it all to me.
It's all about us, as long as we know what it is.

There were moments not always so perfect.
But we know that's just the beauty of it.
Go through things and then we learn from them, oh.
Honestly we can work each other's last nerve.
Then make up with the sweetest of making love.
And no one has to understand that, just us.

Nobody but us.
Only me and him.
We're the only ones that matter.
They know what we've got.
Only me and him.
So we never mind the chatter.

What it is that made us feel so good about it.
What it is that made me go half crazy for.
What it is that made him give it all to me.
It's all about us, as long as we know what it is.
That made us feel so good about it.
What it is that made me go half crazy for.
What it is that made him give it all to me.
It's all about us, as long as we know what it is.

Nobody but us baby.
They can't take you.
They can't take me.
They can't break us down no way.
We're not affected by what they say.
