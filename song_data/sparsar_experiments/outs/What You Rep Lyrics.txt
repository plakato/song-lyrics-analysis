Grippin tools like some new pliers, 
Steamin niggas cuz. We keep irons 
Ima. Do the dash like Stello

We got the same pipes as Halo. 
Choppa leave a nigga with a Halo 
Catch his ass in Rush Hour, .

All I wan na do is just pop a nigga 
Middle fingas to the oppa niggas

Like a record label. Bitch we droppin niggas 
Keep a Tommy on me: cuz, im, stupid cold 
Blow, a nigga with the snub nose 
Aim at your chest, just to lift his soul.
