Guam Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

Why don't we go?
Why don't we go?
Why don't we go Guam?
And why don't we go?
Why don't we go?
Why don't we go?
Let's go Guam!
Life is flowing.
I'm not sharing.
Any pieces of my broken bones.
Minds are glowing.
In the darkest places.
I've been chewing on some stones.
Lets go Guam.
Lets go Guam.
Why don't we go? don't we go?
