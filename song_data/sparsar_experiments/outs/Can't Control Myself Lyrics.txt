Can't Control Myself Lyrics
by Vixen.

I'Ve got ta fill this space inside my head, 
Where the earth comes creepin' in 
So, I'll feel no need for cleansin' 
Don't wan na need you running through me again. 
Retrograde emotion leaves me 
One, step behind. 
I think that I 
I'd do well in a paddle cell. 
Don'T wan na hurt mayself but 
 
REFRAIN 
I can't control myself with you. 
I can't build a wall high enough to 
Keep me from crashing into you. 
You come to unravel me and leave me lifeless. 
 
While idle strays enjoy the feast 
I'm looking for deliverence 
Is. This my own hell or is it yours, 
Can angels, tell the difference anymore, 
I'm chillin' in this hot bed of 
Paranoia and fear, 
I think that I'm dead. If I do 
And I'm dead, if I don't 
I wan na, kick it but 
 
-REFRAIN-, 
, 
I'm, sick of needing only you
