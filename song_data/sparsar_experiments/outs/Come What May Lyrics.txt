Come What May Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: IHooray! It's a Deathtrip.
Come What May.
Me, I get washed away.
Yeah, washed away.
I'm slowly sinking.
You watch me disappear.
Yeah, disappear.
Cause I can't hold on.
Well I'm leaving, it's now or never.
In the morning I'm gone forever.
I had to give it all.
Now it seems to fade away.
Here I go come what may.
Down, there is no way but down.
Yeah I am lost and found.
Are you crying.
Fool, fool, you had it coming to you.
Yeah, coming to you.
Remove the blindfold.
