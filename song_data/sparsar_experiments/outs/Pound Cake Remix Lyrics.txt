Pound Cake Remix Lyrics
by The Universe.


I, don't hop in yo beef cuss, i'm a vegetarian Nerdy glasses, so quiet like the
librarian., My flows, quick! So when i rap dis it get scary. Medea on you, bro i
goes in Tyler Perry., And you really shouldn't copy me. You, like toffee, cuss
i'm, chewing on you constantly.. You say i suck so you acting dishonestly. And
when, i come, threw you better, give yo boy apology. And you really like a wanna
Be cuss when Cuss. When i go in All these dudes Mocking me This is real
talk.. I won the lottery. Because these other rappers bland and i give you more
quality., And you really shouldn't bother me cuss once i go off, i'm like a
bomb, there's: no stopping me., You studying my rap, Like the bible, Doxology. I
live by this stuff. So when i lie, i'm really honesty., That's real. You know
the deal.We, keep it trill.. I'M super fly out here made of steel, 
 
I close my eyes and dream. That life gets better.. Everybody bite off me: i'm
more, like a trend setter., You girl at school, taking selfies in my sweater. I'm
Hard like a rock, but you more like a feather., I'm cold like Ice, so i'm Swiss, 
like cheddar., You talking like you nice, but i put in more effort. And I don't
really care. I'ma make this clear.. When you talking bout me there's no one who
compares., I dare you to step up. Im like a legend, you a rookie with this
stuff.. You know what im talking bout. You got control on your girl so why she
walking out. She coming through tonight? No doubt.You tryna start a fight. 
Then i'ma knock. You out. Knock Knock Them. Shots is getting hard to count.
Them shots getting hard to count.
