I Still Lyrics
by Rufio Summers.

You.
You're the reason.
I came tonight.
And I.
Have no reason.
To tell a lie.
You see.
I.
I've been thinking.
For a while.
And I.
I've been dreaming.
Of all the things we used to do back when.
Baby.
I was still givin' it to you good.
I still.
Love it when you tell me how it feels so good.
So good inside.

You know.
I still.
Love it when you tell me how it feels so good.
Then you tell me how you like that.
The way I got ya leaning right back.
Leaning back on this passion and lovin' that we have been making and I've.
been.
Dreaming of.
Baby tell me how you like that.
The way I got ya leaning right back.
Leaning back on this passion and lovin' that we have been making and I've.
been.
Dreaming of.
Cause I.
Still.
Love it when you tell me how it feels so good.
So good.
Inside.
You know.
I still.
Love it when you tell me how it feels so good.
So good.
You see.
I.
I've been thinking.
For a while.
Oh yeah.
I still love it when you tell me how it feels so good.
So good inside.
You know.
I still.
Love it when you tell me how it feels so good.
So good.
