Costume Party (live at Brixton Academy) Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

You're too young and you're never gonna know why it hit me.
When I felt on in silence.
No-one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward.
You'll see it's not just a dream now.

You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't know.

You're too young and you're never gonna know why it hit me.
When I felt on in silence.
No-one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward.
You'll see it's not just a dream now.

You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't.

Know oh oh oh, know oh oh oh.
Know oh oh oh, know oh oh oh.

It's what you get when you try to educate a black sheep.
You can't, you won't, you never will.
I'm gonna show you what it takes to see the future.
It's hard but not impossible.

You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't know.
You think you know, you don't.

Know oh oh oh, know oh oh oh.
Know oh oh oh, know oh oh oh oh oh.

You think you know oh oh oh, know oh oh oh.
Know oh oh oh, know oh....

Oh oh, oh ohhh.
Oh oh, oh ohhh.

Oh oh, oh ohhh.
Oh oh, oh ohhh.

Oh oh, oh ohhh.
Oh oh, oh....
