Cut It [Freestyle] Lyrics
by Yung Rudd.


Whoa 
Scoona on the boards 
Rudds on the bars 
Bands bands 
Sing it one more time: 
Whoa 
2 Much Vybz, 
Yo yo 
 
I make it rain. Like I'm Dame Lorr- 
And, I does lay down the damn law: 
Allyuh does flex like a dancefloor 
But I'll wash you like. I have chores 
I'll, take a smoke if it's grass sure 
I love a joint like a task force. 
If you rel sticking and hogging that spliff 
Then. I suggest that you pass more 
See through the fakes like a glass door 

On. These beats, I be beasting 
Gyal hot. On my ass, like a bee sting 
Send me a snap of that g-string 
A. Next, with your legs to the ceiling, 
You know what comes after free thing: 
, 
Pull down them blinds and close in them: curtains 
For, the toms them who be peeking 
Then RIP to your lady parts. 
Can. I get an amen like what Meek sing 
Cock back and wine no Riesling 
And. Take it all. No cheating 
I finish her, like MK 
Make. Sure no one go know about these things. 
Then leave that reds like Lee Sing, 
 
Boom, bye, bye, 
Ooh, Quite high 
Hit. The bud live it up, 
Spit, it tough. Give me love 
Give, a fuck about you. Why 
Why, if you hating on me 
Cause, I bring together all different colours like I do, tie dye, 
If men say: I'm not true. Dai lie: 
Yung have no O dude stylized 
 
That's word to people who spell it wrong. 
Get it right and I'll feel good. Like that Beres song 
Plus. I go ham on wax, so DJs wheel, it like ferris 
Bong rips, just to make sure the stress is down 
Need a muse with some big breasts in thongs 
Sucking, while saying Impressive dong. 
Saying you have more with less is wrong. 
Men does be sticking to drop fire 
So. I does keep snapping like Fericon 
One thing, my bars. Never let me down 
Especially when you show me where the bud is 
Stacey Dash so dumb, but still I need to cut it. 
 
Cut, it x8 
Yo Trump. Your tanning time, you need to cut it, 
Ted Cruz, your nose to long. You need to cut it. 
 
Cut, it x8 
Those Clinton speeches fees, you need to cut it, 
Yo Bernie, all their ass. You need to cut it. 
 
Bands bands, 
Whoa 
2 Much Vybz 
God Level, is on the way. If you didn't already know, 
Laying the smack down on y'all bitch ass, niggas, 
Trapso
