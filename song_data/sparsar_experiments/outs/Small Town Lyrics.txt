Small Town Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

Syn.
If I stolled into your town.
Would you follow me around.
If I, I hung out on your block.
Would you telephone a cop.

Shaggy 2 Dope.
If I was new around here and hittin' on your daughter.
And took her to the creek and fucked her in the water.
Then she brought me home and I put on your robe.
Would you be mad enough to let your barrels explode.

Syn.
If I sold your son cocaine.
Would you put a bullet in my brain.
If I, I stole your favorite cow.
Would you cock the hammer back and be like pow, I bet you would.

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me.
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me.
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me.
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me.

Syn.
Your daughter, she just had sex with me.
I fed her some drank and ecstasy.
If I, if I don't steal your cow.
Would you let me live in your barn.

Shaggy 2 Dope.
I don't have a problem with small town folk, nope.
I like y'all, as soon as I flip this dope.
I'm a open a titty bar next to the school, uh ha.
I'm glad we all neighbors, I mean, I think it's cool.

Syn.
If I walked in your church drunk out my mind.
Would you still let me sip up on that red wine.
If we, we played your shitty town.
Would you help me and pass these flyers round, yeah.

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me.
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me.
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me.
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me.

Violent J.
Southern love baby, don't doubt it.
Don't let my records fool you, I'm about it.
I love fat rednecks who fuck they kids.
Beat they wife and yet serve no bids.
Only judge in town, he also the cop.
He also the barber at the hair chop shop.
He the mayor, the clerk, and what I'm speakin', shit.
He the one fuckin' his kids and wife beatin'.
There ain't no law, gonna punish himself.
And that's why the carnival's bad for your health.
When we get there, we gonna get rid of ya.
They gon' find a piece of ya head in Bolivia.
I'll lay you out front with your corpse to rest.
And a Hatchetman flag stickin' outta your chest.
Say hello to the new sherif, Violent J.
With one law, let there be Juggalo-ism all day.

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me.
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me.
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me.
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me.

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me.
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me.
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me.
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me.

I think I like it.
Fuck that, I'm staying.
Right here, I like it.
Hey, I like it.
Yeah.
