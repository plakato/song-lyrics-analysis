Beyond And Back Lyrics
by X.

I'll go somewhere else.
I'll move to the couch.
It's darker in the dark.
It's darker in the day.
I forgot you were a liar.

Now it's five to twelve.
Shut up and smoke.
And I'll go somewhere else.
No more orange nightgowns.
One o'clock and then it ends.
One o'clock and then it ends.
One o'clock and then it ends.

This is no place.
This is no place.
To be addicted to another place.

Never get to go.
Don't you want me to make it.
I took as long as you took.
You take a lot from me.
I forgot you were a thief.

I want to be like her.
Instead I stay nowhere.
Marked down in the basement.
Lousy at the bottom.
A life of intermission.
A life of intermission.
A life of intermission.

This is no place.
This is no place.
To be addicted to another place.

I'll go somewhere else.
I'll move to the couch.
It's darker in the dark.
It's darker in the day.
I forgot you were a liar.

Now it's five to twelve.
Shut up and smoke.
And I'll go somewhere else.
No more orange nightgowns.
One o'clock and then it ends.
One o'clock and then it ends.
One o'clock and then it ends.
