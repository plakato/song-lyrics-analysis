Fred Broca Lyrics
by Wordburglar.


Know, where we're going 
It's a nice little town, 
No infidels here, telling kids to settle down 
You're gon na get a new daddy soon 
It's taken care, of-, 
Bada-bing, bada-boom 
Strapped in a padded room, plastic surgery, 
Wasn't optional-, drastic 
For, eternal allegiance, 
A legion of elite sentries. To help you lead pleasantries 
Huh And they call us the enemy 
But. Anyone with my face is a
friend of me. 
So, take a look in the mirror and tell me who's there, 
I'm, going to a fair and assume there 
If we catch you in a Cee-Gee
T-shirt 
And. You don't know my name- 
You're gon na be hurt. 
That'Ll do 
Didn't mean to rattle you 
Consider it a battle: groove 
Shut up and drink; your apple juice, 
, 
It's, Fred, Broca, 
I, gotcha .
 With light skills, I be the- 
 Duplicate, rap-roller, 
It's, Fred, Broca, 
The original hair-rocker .
 I went through torture, 
 Deadly sounds under author 
You, don't know who you talk: ta 
Your, door's, locked out, 
 Your doubt in tongues like you're, trying to test me 
 
And. Now you're wondering 
Where the fuck, your mate went 
Yeah. He had an engagement, 
For attitude, rearrangement 
Scanner in the basement, 
Now. Let'S talk about your placement 
Dental plans and fully paid vacations on Broca Beach, 
H and R. Tell them to talk to me: 
We pay, top-notch fees for jobs; well done, 
But failure! Well, son 
Let's not go there, 
It's, no fair to conjugate 
Dire conjecture upon your fate. 
Just. Take your papers 
And, be on your way. 
Andale 
Working on a way to weather, dominate 
On the crate 
Don't be concerned. 
We got a saying, 
A dead body, 
Is, a lesson learned: 
Don't stress the earn. 
Just keep your eyes on the prize. 
And who knows 
You might just stay alive, 
 
end .
 We need a man for the operation, you know the MO 
You better act, proper, 
Fuck, elopers, 
I, take it in the chopper 
I got the weather, dominator 
Your, liver gets chopped up, 
I got the MASS device 
See you later-, ah 
It's, Fred, Broca 
You, know who you Talk to

Suck, my Broca .
 We need a man for the operation. You know the MO 
It's Fred Broca
