A Prophecy of Worlds to Fall Lyrics
by Xandria.

I am the one that is walking the night.
Sleepless I'm dreaming - eyes wide open.
Watching the sky for the ashes to fall.
Ending illusions - I keep on hoping.
For this world to survive - to keep me alive.
So for all you ever desired, you wanted to be.
Was shining so bright but only a dream.
And nothing remains but this fantasy.
Oh this world is falling down.
Frozen by gold that has turned into ice.
I kept all the secrets deep inside me.
Now I will pass them on - now, now you are the one.
So for all you ever desired, you wanted to be.
Was shining so bright but only a dream.
And nothing remains but this fantasy.
Oh this world is falling down.
Et audivi vocem magnam dicentem septem angelis.
Effundite septem fialas asperitae mundi in somnium.
Vidi cum aperuisset sigillum sextum.
Terrae motus factus est.
Magnus sol factus est niger luna tota facta est sicut sanguis.
And as it opened the final seal.
I stood alone on crumbled ground.
The stars had fallen And the sun was cold.
This world has never been.
Only for the seeing it will be seen.
I was given the seal and the key.
And I will keep it until I die.
All you ever desired, you wanted to be.
Was shining so bright but only a dream.
And nothing remains but this fantasy.
Oh this world is falling down.
It's falling down for you.
