The Way You Feel Lyrics
by Woodie.

Tonight We Blaze 
Drop Fade On The Dank In The Bay All Day. Maintain 
Maryjane Keep Fazing The Haze 
Hit The Jay. Always I Stay On. Swade Got No Shame 
And. I Won't Change Cuz. You Can't Tame Game 
Plus. We Hang In A Place Where Things Are Strange. 
Your Brains Get Blown From A Pistol Place That Scrill Allday 
Hit The Hill Parlay Til. There Ain't, No Punks Or Cowards 
You Hangin Around Us Better, Be Down With Us. 
There Ain't No Insults Jack On Impulse, 
Drama Happens, But Imma Savage 
Those, Scandalis Pos Tryin To Do Damage 
Im Chokin On Rope In A Cloud Of Smoke 
But Before You Kno It, I Vansish 
And My Eyes Still Slanted Grabbin The 40 
Posted Wit My Homies Smoke Wit. It Closely 
Watchin You Fonys Act Like You Kno Me, 
But Still Stayin One Step Ahead Of The Police, 
Slowly Aproach We Dont Stand Too Close, 
Not Even Beside Me And Neva Behind Me. 
Too Many Robberies Got Me On Paranoid 
Cokin, My Mettle Toy 
Like, A Hoe Watch Me Point 
Clear My Voice And Grip. My Groin 
Twist Some Moist To Gettin Bizzy 
Remmeding, Your Homeboys Wit, My Homeboys 
When Bustas, Make A Choice To Avoid The Game, Get Strange. 
Pull Up The Snatch And Hit The Gas Pass Round. The Joint 
Im Passed The Point Of Redemption 
Reject, The Stress 
And Slice, The Vega, With A Razor And Blaze, The Veda 
Sheke Em. Fifty With My Down And Filthy Native Behavoir 
We Puts It Down In The Town Where Im From 
Nothim, But A G Thang In The East, Maine 
Smokin, Dank Up In The Golden State 
Tryin To Get Paid Watchin. The Bitchmade Pimp 
They Still Stay In The Midst Of Drama 
Ridaz Creep Like Spidaz 
On, The Late Nighta, But We Fightas 
Timeless Ridaz Survivers, Light The Rope Pop It At Some Hoes 
Can Get Exposed Before Those Panties Duurrroppp 
Its. The Same One Goes Down 
We Blow Our Clouds In The Town Of Antioch, 
 
Dont, Be Afraid Of The Way You Feel 
Blaze Up The Jay And Take A Hit Of That Kill. 
Dont Be Afraid Of The Way You Feel 
Its. The Bomb 
Its Like Mental, That I Get Lit. 
That Icky Is My Favorite 
 Got ta A Cravin. Can I Shake It? 
Shes Beggin Me To Take It 
Supposed To Lift With Caution. 
That Killas Got Me. Coughin. 
I Ain't Droppin And I Ain't Stoppin 
Until Them Ballas Start Recroppin 
And Im Often Gone Off That Rope 
And. I Hope That This Danksmoke 
Will Get Me Lifted Results Of My Addiction, 
Im, Hitting Baby Crazy 
Something Like Daily And Lately Ive Been Feenin 
For, Her Love. So I Spend Dubs And Fill My Lungs 
Inhale And Exhale Indo Flows When We 
Blow Hydroponics Havin. None Smokers Astonished, 
Gone Off 50 Sacs Get Polished, Im Hella Sauced 
Tossed Off That Greenery With Dankclouds. In My Scenery They Seem 
To, Be Completin Me 
And. I Got These Bomb Sacs 
Givin In Some Dental Contact To All Them, 
Smokers That Dont Smoke And Dont Kno How To React. 
But Dont Be Afraid When Mj Got Your Thoughts, Delayed 
Its. Just That Triple A Grade That Steady Fuccin Wit. Your Brain 
I Got My Flame To My Savior Wrapped Up In A Vega 
Cuz. I Love How She Tell This To My Kickback Behavior 
And. I Can't Stop, Won't Stop. I Smoke Pot Til. My Casket Drops 
I Luve The Steady Callin 
So. I Got. Ta Drop A 10 Spot Yea 
Woodies Caught Off That Oe. Those Who Kno Me 
Kno, I Dont Smoke Weed, But Them Greenbud, Smokin Homies 
Keep On Forcin, The Dank Up On Me, 
Whats A Soldier To Do 
The Pressure Has Got Me In A Predickament 
There Tellin Me To Hit That Shit. 
Tellin Me That Its The Sticky Shit 
Im Thinkin Dam, Its Only Herb Im Already Perked 
Ill Take One Hit Thats. It Then Quit 
But Thats Bullshit. They Get Me Smokin The Whole Spliff 
So Low D, Who I Be W-Doubl O-Die Off That Old E 
That. I Be Barely Hittin On That Tall-E. So, If You Happen, 
To Find Me High Endin Up Wit, My Homeboys 
Better, Shake That Spot And Get Off That Block. 
That Got Me: Paranoid Grippin, A Pistol Under My Jersey, 
Trigger Finger Ready To Yank 
Got Me Talkin Twice To A Mobile 
Like, My Homeboy Lil Nate Bates 
And. Now I Feel, Like Mobbin 
55 Degrees Out With That Top Down 
In A Lark Parking Thru, The Yoc Town 
With, The Heater On Whos A Hog. Now 
That Indo Got Me Hella High 
Smobbin Gazin At The Sky, 
Thinkin Back On Jr, High 
Me And Blackbird Side By Side 
Wishin. He Was In The Ride, 
That Bomb That Got Me Teary, Eyed 
That Bomb That Makin Me Snap, Sometimes 
When. I Grab My Strap Prepare To Die 
When Ever I Smoke Up Off This Kill 
, Who Wants To Chill 
So When You Take A Hit Of This Kill, 
Dont, Be Afraid Of The Way? U Feel .
