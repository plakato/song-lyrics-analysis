Give It All Away Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

Elelele city hush, 
 
I carry sex on my back like my father. 
I carry love like my mother. Did. 
I want to share it all with another 
Lost soul waiting there for me, 
So much pain, 
Too, much pain, 
I can't take it. 
I want to give it all 
Give it all away. 
 
I want to give it all 
Give it all away. 
 
I want to give it all 
Give it all away. 
 
Oh Come on with the next one, ... 
 
See, you naked 
See, you broken 
See. You lonely 
See, you praying for your freedom lost, 
We, destroy our past roots beauty. 
The monuments are falling down: 
For Tibet, 
For burnt land, 
For, the black land 
For the lovers and haters 
Non believers 
And for those who 
Who pray to god. 
Won'T you shade a tear for our mother earth: 
 
Gcwala, ngam, mfana, 
Gcwala, ngam, mfana, singorhasatsha, 
Mizuzu, eyi, siphohlongo, 
Shade, a tear for our mother earth, 
Mizuzu eyi, siphohlongo, 
Shade, a tear for our mother earth, 
 
Shade, a tear, ... 
Shade, a tear 
I want to shade A tear 
 
He gave his life to the beats. Sounds music 
What man built man burnt it all 
In. My head tic toc, bomb's ticking 
Soul's burning 
Heart, will explode 
Tic, toc bomb's ticking 
 
Cyber crime, 
 
Gcwala ngam mfana 
Gcwala ngam, mfana, singorhasatsha, 
Mizuzu, eyi, siphohlongo, 
Mizuzu, eyi, siphohlongo, 
, 
Gcwala, ngam, mfana, singorhasatsha, 
Siyaliphuza, siyal'phalaza, 
, 
Mizuzu, eyi, siphohlongo, ..., 
, 
Yini, ngathi, anina, verstaan, 
Isifojiso 
Mizuzu eyi siphohlongo ... 
 
Siyaliphuza, 
Siyal'phalaza, 
, 
Gcwala, ngam, mfana, 
Gcwala, ngam, mfana, singorhasatsha, 
Mizuzu, eyi, siphohlongo, 
Mizuzu, eyi, siphohlongo, 
 
I'm, giving it all away 
Giving it all away. 
I'M giving my pain away. 
I want you, ... 
I, need you ...

Elelele city hush,
