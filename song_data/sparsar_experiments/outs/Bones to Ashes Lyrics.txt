Bones to Ashes Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Angel of death is walking through the ice-cold air.
To take the witches remains, he comes to take his share.
Hangman has done his work, destroying their dirty minds.
Loyal to the church to torture and to bind.
Murder and grinding, searching and finding a victim to kill.
Oppression and torment, killing to defend their faith.

Bones to ashes, black witches are blown to dust.
Bone to ashes, torment's for religious lust.
Bones to ashes, black witches are blown to dust.
Bone to ashes, torment's for religious lust.

Tormenter's raising his torch ino the sky.
To burn the convicted witch who is condemend to die.
He transmutes her body to dust to free her soul.
Fire destroys her flesh, no bell for her which tolls.

Murder and grinding, searching and finding a victim to kill.
Oppression and torment, killing to defend their faith.

Bones to ashes, black witches are blown to dust.
Bone to ashes, torment's for religious lust.
Bones to ashes, black witches are blown to dust.
Bone to ashes, torment's for religious lust.

Pest and damnation to those who are delude.
Of too much blood and death they are accused.
Two much tombs and tiger, a treason to all mankind.
Fuck these bastards who are blind.
Murder and grinding, searching and finding a victim to kill.
Oppression and torment, killing to defend their faith.

Bones to ashes, black witches are blown to dust.
Bone to ashes, torment's for religious lust.
Bones to ashes, black witches are blown to dust.
Bone to ashes, torment's for religious lust.
