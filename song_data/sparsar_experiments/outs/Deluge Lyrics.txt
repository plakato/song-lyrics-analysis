Deluge Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


Well at ease.
Mellow breeze.
Grazing over flesh.
Humming melodies.
Zealously.
Let's never leave the state we're in.
Serenity.
A better you, a better me.
Fidelity.
Pride set aside to make amenities.
Only you and i on a stormy eve.
Empathy between our lips.
Making sure to breathe.
I crack the window.
So you cling to me for warmth.
As we listen to the steady drops.
Dancing on the rooftops.

Eye in the sky.
By all that is right.
We own the night.
So don't take me to heaven.
I fought through the flames.
So whisper my name.
Breathing as one.
I won't go to heaven.

Sweet divine.
Me and mine.
In harmony.
I'll give you all of me.
Sweet divine.
Me and mine.
In harmony.

Would you put up a fight.
If i left you alone.
Lead the way to the light.
I'll bring you along.
The everlasting dream.
Of a thousand hearts.
Love so serene.
Try and tear it apart.

Sweet divine.
Me and mine.
In harmony.
I'll give you all of me.
Sweet divine.
Me and mine.
In harmony.
I'll give you all of me.
