With Black Gloves Lyrics
by Volcanoes.

Slip out the back door, down the gutter, run as fast as I can through the.
alley.
Out of the city, out of the suburbs, past the railroad station to the place.
where we last met.
The bark is torn in the shape of a heart with the initials of you and me.
So I grab my machete and I start swingin' until there's nothin' but mulch.
beneath my feet.

Drop down to my knees, I start diggin' about as fast as I can with my hands.
I dig and I dig and I dig and I dig until the nails fall from my fingers.
I dig all night long until I can't stretch out my hands up to the surface.
Yeah, I thought it was for you, but now I can't get out, so I think I'll stay.
a while.

I close my eyes as the dirt hits my face, I can't see, I can't breathe.
But the longer I rest here I start to feel my chest swell up with everything.
I breathe in, breathe out, open my eyes to see I'm not dead at all.
But I'm laying in a pool of sweat in my bed, all alone- you're a nightmare.

You're a nightmare, but I'm not sleeping.
Somebody pinch me; I can't wake up.
