24 Hour Blue (Just One of Those Days) Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


Woke up this morning, 
Feeling so bad 
Out, my window, it was raining. 
Didn'T even feel like running 
I, didn't feel like doing anything. 
 
Then the phone wouldn't stop ringing 
And my head, wouldn't stop pounding 
I feel so down. I don't know why 
There's something overwhelming me inside 
 
Just, one of those days 
Just another day. It don't go your way: 
 
Just, one of those days- oooh 
Just. Another day it don't go your way. 
 
 Got ta get up. Anyhow. 
I can't afford to lose no hours, 
Got a deadline that I must meet. 
Every second matters to me: 
Hard to function feeling like this 
 
But. I got to keep on going 
Am. I, in a huddle to get over 
I've got to do things much darker and colder 
 
Why. Does it seem 
 
Why? Do they fly 
 
La la la la 
, 
La la la 
La, la la 
, 
La la la la 
La, la la 
, 
La la la 
, 
La la la la 
La, la la 
, 
La la la la?
