Don't Look Back Album Lyrics
by Boston.


Don'T look back ooh a new day is breakin' 
It's been too long since I felt this way. 
I don't mind. Ooh, where I get taken. 
The road is callin'. Today is the day 
I can see it took so long just to realize 
I'm much too strong, not to compromise 
Now. I see what I am is holding me down. 
I'Ll turn it around. Oh, yes, I will 
I finally see the dawn. Arrivin' 
I see beyond the road, I'm drivin' 
It's a bright horizon and I'm awakin' now 
Oh. I see myself in a brand new way. 
The sun is shinin' ooh, the clouds are breakin' 
Cause. I can't lose now. There'S no game to play. 
I can tell there's no more time left to criticize 
I've seen what I could not recognize. 
Everything in my life was leading me on 
But. I can be strong, oh yes, I can 
I finally see the dawn. Arrivin' 
I see beyond the road I'm drivin' 
Far away and left behind left behind 
Oh the sun is shinin' 
And, I'm on my road 
Don't look back ooh a new day is breakin' 
It's been so long since I felt this way, 
I don't mind ooh, where I Get taken, 
The road is callin'. Today is the day 
I can see it took so long just to realize 
I'm much too strong, not to compromise 
Now. I see what I am is holding me down. 
I'Ll turn it around. Oh yes, I will 
I, finally see the dawn arriving 
I, see beyond the road. I'M driving 
Far away and left behind. 
Don'T. Look back, 
Don't, look back, 
Don't, look back, 
Don't, look back,

Hey 
I've got no place to be 
And; no one! I'D rather see 
I won't mind if you can find 
The time to stay with me. 
Oh I've got no time for wastin'. 
 Got ta live a life when I can 
I won't hide. If you decide 
To. Let me be your man 
When. I get close to you not much to say 
I, get that same old feeling I had in my younger days. 
And. I can show you the way, 
It's just a game. We play 
It's easy takin' it day by day, 
Hey 
You know I would concede 
And. I think we both agree. 
You and I can testify. 
That love is what we need. 
Just take a look around you livin' for the future is blind. 
I believe what we can achieve will soon be left behind. 
The things I try to say are so hard to find 
If. You doubt what your love is about. It can ease you mind 
And, I can show you the way, 
It's just a game. We play 
It's easy takin'. It day by day, 
Hey 
I've got no place to be 
And. No one. I'D rather see 
I, won't mind. If you find 
That you're in love with me. 
Well we got no time to worry. 
 Got ta live a life when I can 
I won't hide. If you decide 
To, let me be your man 
And. I can show you the way, 
It's just a game. We play 
It's easy takin' it day by day, 
 
If, I said, what's on my mind, 
You'd turn and walk away, 
Disappearing way back in your dreams, 
It's. So hard to be unkind, 
So easy just to say, 
That everything is just the way it seems. 
You look up at me, 
And somewhere in your mind, you see 
A man I'll, never be 
If only. I could find a way 
I'd feel like I'm the man. You believe I am 
And, it gets harder every day for me. 
To hide behind this dream. You see, 
A man I'll never be 
I, can't get any stronger. 
I can't climb any higher 
You'll, never know just how hard I've tried. 
Cry a little longer. 
And hold a little tighter 
Emotions can't be satisfied. 
You look up at me, 
And somewhere. In your mind, you see 
A man I'll, never be 
If only. I could find a way 
I'd feel like I'm the man you believe I am 
And. It gets harder every day for me: 
To hide behind this dream. You see 
A man I'll, never be .
 
Well come on 
All you people 
The time has come to get together. 
You got ta, have a little rock'n' roll music 
To, get you through the stormy weather 
And. Do whatever you feel 
When you let go 
Nothin's gon na help, you more than rock'n' roll 
So, come on. Put you hands together. 
You know it's now or never 
Take a chance on rock'n' roll

You oughta, know:

Cause win or lose it's alright. 
Well take control. 
And nothin's gon na help you more than rock'n' roll 
So, come on 
Put you hands together.

Take a chance on rock'n' roll

Well, you know I don't get off on workin' day after day, 
I wan na have some fun, while I'm here 
I play the game when it's goin' my way, 
And there's nothin' like a party when it's kickin' into gear, 
I'm gettin', ready for a party tonight, 
Yes, I'm gettin' ready to cruise 
And if you've got somethin' for me, 
I've got somethin' for you, 
Baby 
It's a party and nobody cares. 
What we're doin' there 
Baby it's a party as long as you're there 
It's a party party party 
I, can't believe it when some people say 
That. It'S a sin that way we live to die. 
You know, there's never been a more natural thing. 
Yea there's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie: 
So come on 
Get ready for the time of your life, 
Cause, I'm gettin' right in the groove 
And. If you've got somethin' for me, 
I've got somethin' for you, 
Baby 
It's a party, and nobody cares. 
What we're doin' there 
Baby it's a party as long as you're there 
It's a party party party, 
Yea, yea, yea yea, get down and party. If you need a cue 
You're sure to find one in the crowd, 
Just meet some friends and have a toke or two 
In a place where they can never play the music too loud, 
Get ready for a party tonight 
Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove 
And. If you've got somethin' for me, 
I've got somethin' for you, 
Baby 
It's a party and nobody cares. 
What we're doin' there 
Baby it's a party as long as you're there 
It's a party party party 
You know a man doesn't live on bread alone. 
He'S got to have some lovin' each and every night 
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known, 
Let's get together, honey, it's alright, 
 
Just. Let me hear it from your lips 
It's. The last thing that I'll ask you to say: 
Don't wan na hear it from strangers. 
If it's over. Let me have it straight: 
I've been used 
But, I'm takin' it like a man, 
I'm confused 
But, I'm doin'. The best that I can 
I've been tossed around plenty before 
I've. Had this heart of mine, broken and more 
I can't find a reason for sure 
But. I'Ve gotten used to bad news. 
 
Don't. Tell me why 
Yes it's over. I can see the end 
But. Please don't lie 
If you're leavin' me like a friend 
I've been tossed around plenty of times. 
And I've read between all the lines 
You're just another in the grand design, 
And I've gotten used to bad news. 
I know what you're sayin' is bad 
It's, not what I wanted, but I'm ready for that 
I'm ready for that. Yea 
I've been used, 
But, I'm takin'. It like a man 
I'm confused 
But, I'm doin' the best that I can 
I've been tossed around plenty before 
I've. Had this heart of mine, broken and more 
I can't find a reason for sure. 
But. I'Ve gotten used to bad news, 
 
Now. If you're thinkin''bout, a love that left you 
Thinkin', you should hide away 
Girl. I think it's wrong. 
You just try to be strong. Now babe 
Listen, to what I've got to say. 
I know the feelin' that you feel today. 
But, don't be afraid of love 
Tell, you how I feel about you, 
Tell you what you want to hear 
Tell you that it's true 
But, it's all up to you now babe 
Don't! Let your love disappear. 
Can'T, believe that I'll be stayin' here. 
But, don't be afraid of love. 
Baby, don't you know. Good love is hard to find 
Don't. You think I know what's goin' through your mind, 
One man left you cryin', so you shut the door 
Just. Let me inside that's what my love is for. 
Tell you how I feel about you, 
Tell you what you want to hear 
Tell you that it's true 
But, it's all up to you now babe 
Don't! Let your love disappear. 
Can'T, believe that I'll be stayin' here, 
But, don't be afraid of love
