Psycho Pass Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


I'M, coming through the front I ain't, worried'bout shit 
Trying to harm me. I leave his ass. Like a tip 
I'mma. Tell you now I'mma twist him like a hip 
Then smoke, a blunt by my motherfucking self 
I, don't give a fuck'bout none of you here 
Bitch. I only rap just to let you niggas hear 
And when we do a show. Your fan base disappear. 
Bitch, I ain't lying I'mma, keep it sincere 
Bitch, since when could you chill up over here 
Bitch hit the road like a motherfucking deer 
Get hit too shit? Bitch? Might as well 
I don't even talk all a ho do is tell 
I'm standing on a boat finna set the damn sail. 
I burn incense, because my brain likes the smell 
She get a whiff and thought that it was a spell. 
I ain't say come, but she at the hotel, 
Fuck a nigga mean me and my niggas don't be fucking with niggas 
We give no fuck'bout none of you, niggas 
Or, whoever with you 
I, pull up to my nigga then'll spark 
Blunts already rolled what the fuck a Nigga thought 
East, Memphis streets still burning, damn hot 
Police might as well live up on the damn clock. 
That'S. Why I stay in the goddamn house 
On the damn couch while I eat take-out 
Text T.A., when the weed run out 
Call T-Bo, when we finna swerve out 
I, be on the beach feeling like a bird now 
Smoking on a ounce on the roof of the house. 
Master Roshi tried to kick a nigga out 
'Cuz. I had a sack. I ain't tell his ass about 
Bitch, you fucking know what the fuck do. We about 
Hollow Squad, Blunts don't
never, fade out.
