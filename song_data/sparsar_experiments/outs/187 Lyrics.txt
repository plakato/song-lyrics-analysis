187 Lyrics
by Tyga.


T-Raw'S rock my own kick game. 
8 figure deal how I'm court-side at Clip game. 
Still pop ace, king shit, I'm with Ros√© 
Black, Maybach leather, gloves on that OJ. 
Ok the day you beating me bitch no day, 
Bandz A Make Her Dance, that's thousand dollar
foreplay 
AK get a full clip, not a sound wave. 
You kissed her in her mouth. Ask her how my dick taste 
Bitch nigga, you don't want no drama! I'M worth a couple! Commas: 
It's death before dishonor 
Last king come sign up all my shit be
designer 
Extraordinary rhymer I bodied yo' shit, for
nothing 
West up hot temper, 
Get wet up. She give me head not neck up. 
She clean the mess up, 
One false move death from gesture 
Cash in the safe. I don't feel no pressure, 
 
I'm dope, .
 All my shit dope .
 All my shit dope 
Cuz, it's 187, how I'm killing these hoes 
 
Shit, 
She, fuck hermes and the hustle 
Crown on the watch. She got niggas still thuggin' 
8.7 on the crib, so fuck it 
Went gold in a month. So it ain't no budget, 
New chains, rollex links, 
New chick just to drag my mink 
New car just to ride around here, 
Aviator crew. We flyest'round here 
Hating on hood niggas dying'round. Here, 
Bath Salt Boss got insurance on the beard, 
Cars rockstar dope boys at odds 
I done seen it all, but it's back to these broads' 
Hands clap like a nigga in the stadium 
Million dollar chain, but I'm rocking 8 of'em 
I, see you sleeping boy. Don'T make me pick your label up, 
Scottie Pippen on the dribble. I just laid'em
up 
Another triple got me tripping, like it's angel
dust 
We, just winning all the women in my table. Ah 
Say, my name say my name. Nigga say my name: 
100 million dollar name. Nigga say my name: 
 
Dope 
, all my shit, dooe 
, all my shit dope 
Cuz, it's 187, how I killing these hoes 
 
Chief rocka pill, popper 
Tell them pull them things out, cause my car
topless 
Off topic get on top. It wish us some absence. 
So Sincere in her Belly. That'S that Nas shit 
King announcing that gangsta shit we mobbin' 
We, taking your dollars. Creflo no white collar 
I wish a nigga would call thomas 
Bitch im the bomb call me the unabomber 
Money in my game, I'm driving shit, that's insane! 
You! Niggas stay in your lane: no playing ain't, nothing changed! 
Pardon, this good regime. I make your girl David
Blaine. 
Murder was the case. All the kids say that nigga T-raw 
 
Dope 
, all my shit, dooe .
 All my shit dope, 
Cuz, it's 187! How I killing these hoes
