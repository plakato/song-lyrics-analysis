Can't Get Enough Lyrics
by VL Deck.


Grinding, I can't get enough.
I'm in the trap, I can't get enough.
Serving, I can't get enough.
Rocking shows, I can't get enough.
I'm ‘bout my issue, I can't get enough.
I'm paper chasing, I can't get enough.
Going to court, I can't get enough.
I'm in the spot, I can't get enough.

Bitch I'm mister fall out king.
Now back a thousand times, n'aw mean?
Life over a triple beam.
When you park it, it ain't what it seems.
Count up a hundred, dope feel like a dream.
I'm in the kitchen doing my fucking thing.
Jet lag, shit from time zoning.
Link up with ? when I'm town touring.
Spot talk with the best on.
Surround myself with bosses like a fucking don.
Net ? on the socket homie.
Black Amigo Gang, what's a drought homie?

Grinding, I can't get enough.
I'm in the trap, I can't get enough.
Serving, I can't get enough.
Rocking shows, I can't get enough.
I'm ‘bout my issue, I can't get enough.
I'm paper chasing, I can't get enough.
Going to court, I can't get enough.
I'm in the spot, I can't get enough.

Real dope boy, jugg king.
I walk around with 350 thousand dollar chains.
Movin' bricks and bales way before this rap fame.
I'm keep this shit 100, I can't switch lanes.
I'm a boss and I can't get enough.
Jugg, jugg, run your bands up.
Jugg house with no cameras.
It ain't shit off in these streets that I can't handle.
My young niggas, they watch everything.
Try to run off in my spot and it's a murder scene.
Section 8 housing, low it down with pounds of weed.
Ain't no clean around here, remix king.

Grinding, I can't get enough.
I'm in the trap, I can't get enough.
Serving, I can't get enough.
Rocking shows, I can't get enough.
I'm ‘bout my issue, I can't get enough.
I'm paper chasing, I can't get enough.
Going to court, I can't get enough.
I'm in the spot, I can't get enough.

Gas bag stanking.
Young Scooter vacuum seal ‘em.
I'm on stage jumpin' ‘round, now what's the dealing?
Pockets stick out like a cellphone, nigga really?
Independent hooping, ballin' like we major dealing.
I went straight to the cash.
Foot on the gas.
Show you how to hustle nigga.
You really want bags.
Represent for the hoes that be shaking ass.
Shout out to the trap nigga.
Serving gas.
And I'm addicted, I can't get enough.
Addicted to the dog food just like the blood.
? from counting racks gave me a rush.
And I'm a painkiller user, I don't toot dust.

Grinding, I can't get enough.
I'm in the trap, I can't get enough.
Serving, I can't get enough.
Rocking shows, I can't get enough.
I'm ‘bout my issue, I can't get enough.
I'm paper chasing, I can't get enough.
Going to court, I can't get enough.
I'm in the spot, I can't get enough.
