x3.

You know you love me.
I know you care.
Just shout whenever.
And I'll be there.
You want my love.
You want my heart.
And we would never, ever, ever be apart.

Are we an item?
Girl quit playin'.
We're just friends.
What are you sayin'?
Said there's another as you look right in my eyes.
My first love, broke my heart for the first time.

And I was like.
Baby, baby, baby ooh.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby noo.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
I thought you'd always be mine.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby noo.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
I thought you'd always be mine.

Oh oh For you, I would have done whatever.
And I just can't believe we ain't together.
And I wanna play it cool.
But I'm losin' you.
I'll buy you anything.
I'll buy you any ring.
Cause I'm in pieces.
Baby fix me.
And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream.
I'm goin down, down, down, down.
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around.
And I'm like.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby noo.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
I thought you'd always be mine.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby noo.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
I thought you'd always be mine.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm sixteen and I thought that you'd be mine.
But, but, but now your gone.
So far along that I can't even find you.
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you.
Can't believe that you did me wrong.
We were on i-Chat all night long.
Listening to our favorite songs.
She was wrong I am gone.
I thought I loved her, never put no one above her.
Yeah she was my lover, but now onto another like....

Baby, baby, baby ohh.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby noo.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
I thought you'd always be mine.

Baby, baby, baby ohhh.

Baby, baby, baby, noo.
Like.
Baby, baby, baby ohh.
I though you'd always be mine.

I'm gone.

Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone.
