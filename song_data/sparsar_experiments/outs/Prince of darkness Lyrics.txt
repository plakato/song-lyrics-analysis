Prince of darkness Lyrics
by 666.

God...?
I'm not quite sure in what I believe.
Should I follow You, or him?
He promises me the world, a whole life.
Just join hands and let us follow the evil.
Oh God, oh no God have mercy!
Forgive me.

The prince of darkness!

Come my children.
Time is getting late.
And space is getting bounded.
It's time to enjoy your sins.
Just look up to the man in the mirror.
And come...
From out of the shadow.
Into the light.
I guide you to a place on earth.
Where you have never been before.
I stimulate and activate your brain.
Adrenaline is floating through your veins.
Do you reach out for the climax?
Wanna touch the sky?
The sky is the limit.

You can't leave the circle of insanity or serenity.
Do you have faith in the Lord above?
Do you want to be free?
Release yourself and follow me.
The prince of darkness, the prince of darkness.

The prince of darkness...

God...?
I'm not quite sure in what I believe.
Should I follow You, or him?
He promises me the world, a whole life.
Just join hands and let us follow the evil.
Oh God, oh no God have mercy!
Forgive me.

The prince of darkness.

The prince of the darkness.
Forgive me.
