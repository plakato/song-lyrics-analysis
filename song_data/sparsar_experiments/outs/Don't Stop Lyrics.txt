You're, like perfection, some kind of holiday 
You, got me thinking that we could run away. 
You want I'll. Take you there 
You tell me when and where oh-oh oh, oh 
 
But, then I asked for your number said: you don't have a phone 
It's getting late. Now I got ta, let you know 
That. Everybody wants to take you home tonight. 
But, I'm gon na find a way to make you mine, 
 
Don't, stop doing what you're doing 
Every time you move to the beat 
It gets harder for me 
And. You know it know. It know it 
And, don't stop cause. You know that I, like it 
Every time you walk in the room. 
You got all eyes on you 
And, you know it know. It know it 
 
You're, coming close now swear. I can taste it 
You got me tongue-tied. I can't escape it. 
I'M loving what you got 
But, then you push me off. Oh-Oh! Oh, oh 
, 
And! Everybody wants to take you home tonight. 
But! I'M gon na find a way to make you mine, 
 
Don't, stop doing what you're doing 
Every time you move to the beat 
It gets harder for me 
And. You know it know. It know it 
And, don't stop cause. You know that I, like it 
Every time you walk in the room. 
You got all eyes on you 
And, you know it know. It know it 
 
Every day it's the same 
All the games that you play 
Back and forth round and round 
Kinda like it. This way, 
_Don't stop doing what you're doing 
Cause everytime you move to the beat 
It gets harder for me 
And. You know it know. It know: it_
