Wilderness Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Love we got love.
You got to believe me.
We got love.
Love we got love.
We got love.
You got to believe me x2.

We got love we got love.
We can't keep it all inside.
We got needs we got needs.
We can make it through the fight.
We got love we got love we can fake it for a while.
We got dreams we got dreams.
Where's a hell not to try.

Now you got to believe me.
Now you got to believe me.
You got to believe me.

To me You are.
On in a million to me.
To me You are.
On in a million.
Where you go i go.
Do you feel it.
To me You are.
On in a million to me.
