Interlude Gennis Lyrics
by Wonder Broz.

Gennis 
Cut my mic on 
Micro-microphone check, 
Keep the lights off, ready, ready, ready, set 
Here. I go all in one motion: 
Cruise on the beat call that dead, coastin' 
Girls call me lotion cause when it's dry 
Moist it up Frank Ocean 
Mm for real, though 
I'm kinda quiet to myself. Quite the weirdo 
Wonder Broz, your favorite supe- 
Favorite superhero 
Never been a zero pockets on fat mode. 
I ain't got ta spell it out. She know how I'm 
Row row row your boat, 
I live and breathe. Ncredible shout out to my C.E.O. He already know 
Nick pulled the out, so we about to blow 
Patty cake baker, man we gets that dough. Oh 
You know who I be stuntin murder on that alphabet. 
Lucky lucky me: I'm G 
In, the hot spot, toastin' rotisserie on the beat watch. How I roast it 
You, already know this zoom in closer adjust your focus 
Call that hocus pocus abracadabra 
Everything matters and that's straight facts. My pops taught me that 
Go hard or go home is the motto'til. Our fades are black 
 
I. Never look back! I'M young us
