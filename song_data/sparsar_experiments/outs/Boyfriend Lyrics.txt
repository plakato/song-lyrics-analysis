Boyfriend Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.


If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go.
I can take you places you ain't never been before.
Baby take a chance or you'll never ever know.
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow.
Swag swag swag, on you.
Chillin' by the fire while we eatin' fondue.
I don't know about me but I know about you.
So say hello to falsetto in three two swag.

I'd like to be everything you want.
Hey girl, let me talk to you.

If I was your boyfriend, never let you go.
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone.
I can be a gentleman, anything you want.
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd.
Never let you go.

Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don't.
I could be your Buzz Lightyear fly across the globe.
I don't never wanna fight yeah, you already know.
Imma make you shine bright like you're laying in the.
Snow.
Burr.
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend.
You could be my girlfriend until the -- world ends.
Make you dance do a spin and a twirl and.

Swaggie.

I'd like to be everything you want.
Hey girl, let me talk to you.

If I was your boyfriend, never let you go.
Keep you on my arm girl you'd never be alone.
I can be a gentleman, anything you want.
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd.
Never let you go.

So give me a chance, â€˜cause you're all I need girl.
Spend a week with your boy I'll be calling you my.
Girlfriend.
If I was your man, I'd never leave you girl.
I just want to love you, and treat you right.

If I was your boyfriend, never let you go.
Keep you on my arm girl you'd never be alone.
I can be a gentleman, anything you want.
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, never.
Let you go.
Na na na, na na na, na na na.
Ya girl.
Na na na, na na na, na na na ey.
If I was your boyfriend.
Na na na, na na na, na na na ey.
Na na na, na na na, na na na ey.
If I was your boyfriend.
