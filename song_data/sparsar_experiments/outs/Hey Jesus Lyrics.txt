Hey Jesus Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

One Two, One Two.
Hey Jesus help me out here.
I'm alone with what sure ain't clear.
Cause every time I climb a mountain half the size.
Than everyone else out there.

And I know I'm ungrateful.
I got sunshine plenty days full.
But I don't mind a cloud.
And a confrontation now.
Just might be what I'm asking for.
A silhouette from which to run.
And an absence from the fun.
I don't work hard enough for.
But I'll be alright yeah.
Maybe I'll just be a man.
Or an individual.
Doomed to be the lucky I am.

Hey brother said listen Jesus.
I've been needing a word between us.
The queen of where I fall.
With the keys end it all.
Well she ain't getting on well.

But I'll be alright yeah.
Maybe I'll just be a man.
Or an individual doomed to be the lucky guy I am.
An individual doomed to be the lucky guy I am.
