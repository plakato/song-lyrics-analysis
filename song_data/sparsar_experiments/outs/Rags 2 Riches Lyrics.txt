Rags 2 Riches Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.

Produced by THEMPEOPLE and LZ.

Modern Utopia, a White Utopia.
But the darker your skin, you're considered a phobia.
Let's tour all the clocks back, let's reminisce our past.
If we turn far enough, I bet we have a scarred back.
I guess we still waiting for our acres and a mule.
When we're used like a tool and masta was so cruel.
Our shackles still live, they live past the grave.
Just remember each day, you're the dream of a slave.

Highway Riding, Picking up mileage.
Speeding, post 9/11 dreams.
My mind on perfect.
Funny, ironic, I've been waking up and living like a king.
Everything diamond, Everything ego.
Everything shining.
Black Kings.
All of us shinning.
Black kings.

Martin Luther King Jr's “I Have a Dream” Speech.
