Finally Lyrics
by 702.

I couldn't breath.
I couldn't see.
I couldn't think.
I cannot believe.
How good it felt when we touched.
Yea, yea.
I couldn't fight.
I couldn't try.
I couldn't hide.
I cannot deny.
That lightening can stike more than once.

Finally I know everything is possible.
Finally I know everything that some things our beyond our control.
Finally I know all is fair in love &amp; war.
Finally I know there's no need for keeping score.
No need to worry.

I didn't see.
I didn't want.
I didn't need.
I did not recognize.
That love was ther inside your ride, yea.
I didn't say.
I didn't ask.
I didn't complain.
I did not resign.
But somethin' happened that felt so right.

I was so amazed by the magic that I found in you.
I can't descibe it.
But I know that I like it - what you do.

Finally I know everything is possible.
Finally I know everything that some things our beyond our control.
Finally I know all is fair in love &amp; war.
Finally I know there's no need for keeping score.
No need to worry.

Finally I know that life has a guarantee.
&amp; nuthin' tears the flame.
&amp; everything must shame.
Finally I've come to realize.
That there is a reason for every season.

I was so amazed by the magic that I found in you.

I can't descibe it.
But I know that I like it - what you do.

Finally I know everything is possible.
Finally I know everything that some things our beyond our control.
Finally I know all is fair in love &amp; war.
Finally I know there's no need for keeping score.
No need to worry.
