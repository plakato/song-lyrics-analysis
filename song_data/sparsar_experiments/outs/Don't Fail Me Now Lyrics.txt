Don't Fail Me Now Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Oh gal, oh gal, with your darkened eyes.
Kindle the wood and prepare the fires.
And don't fail me know.
Oh gal, oh gal, with your darkened soul.
Kindle the wood and get ready to roll.
Just don't fail me now.
And don't fail me now.
You don't do me right.
You don't do me right.
Why you do me wrong when the rope gets tight?
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.

Oh gal, oh gal with your darkened soul.
Bundle up my things and get ready to roll.
And don't fail me now.
Oh Mary, oh, mother of all that is near.
Lead me to freedom from my kingdom of fear.
And don't fail me now.
Just don't fail me now.

You don't do me right.
You don't do me right.
Why you do me wrong.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
When the rope gets tight.
Why you do me wrong.
Why you do me wrong.
When the rope gets tight.
