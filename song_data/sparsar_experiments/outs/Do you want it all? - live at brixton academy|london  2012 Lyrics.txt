Do you want it all? - live at brixton academy|london  2012 Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

We're low in our hearts.
We're low in our heads.
But all in good time.

Do you want it.
Do you want it.
Do you want it all?

We're low in our hearts.
We're low in our heads.
But all in good time.
We'll take charge.
We'll all take our chances.
All in good times.

Do you want it.
Do you want it.
Do you want it all?

All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
All because you want to be.
