Avalanche (Slow) Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

In the end I saw you.
Visions of something I wasn't used to.
And I let it all go, oh.
With my heart, with my body, with all.

And it all falls down.
And it all comes around.
And it all goes down.
And it all comes.
Oh, it all comes around.

And I knew it will be you.
Coming at me like you do.
Feel my heart, my soul with fire.
And I won't know.
No, I won't know who you are.

Cause it all falls down.
Cause it all goes down.

And it all falls down.
And it all goes down.
And you never let it go.
And it all comes down.
