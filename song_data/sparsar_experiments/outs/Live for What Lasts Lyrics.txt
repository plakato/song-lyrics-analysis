Live for What Lasts Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

After 5 years of fighting this. One autumn took on more meaning for us.
Psalm 23 below the stairs. Around old photos, but your face will disappear.
Earnest prayers and heartfelt tears on the field that night. They graced our.
ears.
Your waves through the passenger window meant more than a simple goodbye.
Winter comes, winter goes. We hold composure like weeping willows.
Your empty lungs and quiet heart finally bring you peace but tear our hearts.
apart.
What I'd give to live our last 10 years again.
I'd promise you I would do it so much different..
These are the serious strums of a sad song.
As the sun sets, the silhouettes simplify the scene. I call it inconsistency.
Oh God, give us a sunrise. Let midnight turn to morning.
And let me see clearly why you would let this happen to a family.
We laugh cause it hurts too much to cry.
You live in memory of him.
Carry on kid.
And just like him live for what lasts to become the man he saw you to be.
