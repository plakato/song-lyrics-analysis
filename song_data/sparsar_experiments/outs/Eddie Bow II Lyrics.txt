I, told yall comin' later on's, the Eddie Bow part two 
They still sweatin' so hard and it's a shame. They need more 
Cause way back in the day they just needed - 3 or 4, but now 
It's 95', and I dont have to show you how I know you remember 
That old dance, that I call the Eddie Bow 
 
Bitch. We never gon' what Bitch we always gon bow 
Bitch. We never gon'. What Bitch we always gon bow. 
Won'T ya, Bow Bow Bow, Bow, Bow, Bow, Bow. 
Won'T ya, Bow Bow Bow Bow Bow Bow Bow 
 
Upstairs at Yuma's. At the bar I stopped. I turned around 
They peeped me out: hoes was on my jock. Now the 3rd is in the house. 
Bout to engulf this bitch Duck You bout to get ya world plotted, 
By them soldiers in them, Chucks some real ass niggas, some down ass, niggas, 
See them 3rd ward, niggas, see them 3rd ward. Niggas. Now I like a dog bitch 
Big nasty like a freak. Like my ex 17th Ward, bitch Rajaree, she used to lick 
My whole body and she didn't, but on the real like a man, she could 
Suck a mean. Dick now won't ya bow for the 3rd ward. I say now bow for the 
10th ward. Now won't ya bow for the 13th. I say now bow for the 17th 
 
I was doing about 60 in my pure white Got my phone and call up Tec 
Because. We was going to the Rochambeau'. He said it wasn't that long before 
You spent that fuckin' corner He got that bitch out duckin 
Racing up the block had to front on them hoes, and I kept my shield up 
Had to show em' my golds first stop at St. Thomas when I saw this Hoe 
I peeped her face and hit a hole. I hit the ground fall on my right, nigga 
Bow for a nigga that keep in line can't forget that whole posse off. Second 
And drive, Won't ya, bow for the Melphamine. I say now bow for the Josephine 
Now. Won'T ya bow for the Calio. Now won't ya bow for the Calio. Now won't ya 
Bow for the Magnolia. Now won't ya bow for the Magnolia 
 
Them hoes, with the real short hair stopped too guess who I seen the 17th
crew 
All. They know it's Yella and Tec. A.K.A. just call em'. U I got my nigga Lil Ya, 
Fuckin' them hoes. With his Glock all 3. We combust together
