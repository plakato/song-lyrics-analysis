CUGIRL (LZ Refix) Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.

Produced by Steve Lacy || Edited by LZ.

I wanna.

I wanna see you girl.
I wanna please you girl.
Go ahead and be you girl.
Can't wait to see you girl.
I wanna.

I haven't seen you in awhile, you know I miss you babe.
When you hear this song, feel flattered it's about your face.
And how I miss it and I wish that I can see it more.
But you're in college now and I'm about to go on tour.

Beat Change: LZ Refix.
