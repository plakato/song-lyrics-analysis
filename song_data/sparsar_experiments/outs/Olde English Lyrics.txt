Olde English Lyrics
by Uno Hype.


The lavish life 
Livin wrong, hopin that the path is right, 
Ye and hov told us this can't be life 
Getting. All I want hopin that I had it twice: 
A lot a livin to do before I die they on my fire 
That burns and pass the mike 
Ye and hov told us. This can't be life 
Livin wrong, hopin that the path is right. The path is right. 
 
Don't give up nigga just keep goin 
That's. What they told me so now I got ta show em 
When, I'm tokin blow holes in they chest like what they totin 
What. They smoking homie. Just don't provoke him 
He crazy wit dat. I murdered they best shit. 
They gon hate me for dat tryna get on my job. They too lazy for dat 

Apologizing. Now too late for that 
This rap shit. I was made for that 
Like who else was 
Killin everything like who else does 
Got different color broads, like 3Ldub 
But. We headed from the start getting everything. 
So love, don't lose yo heart. You might well due to the mic skills. 
Hype will put these niggas to bed like Nyquil 
Give. All these niggas girlfriends slight chills, mutha fucka, 
 
The, lavish life 
Livin wrong, hopin that the path is right, 
Ye and hov told us this can't be life 
Getting. All I want hopin that I had it twice: 
A lot a livin to do before I die they on my fire 
That burns and pass the mike 
Ye and hov told us. This can't be life 
Livin wrong, hopin that the path is right. The path is right. 
 
Stuntin frontin till the cold metal barrel, 
Reach contact and gun, clap, the stuntin and the smile 
Which. You got on my four t: homie 
Once. They put the work on the czp 
It'll, be all you got now all you coped 
It's hard to stumble metal tearin through all you, rock 
Shouldn't treat your self with the dollars. You be stackin, 
And, packin a 9-5. You been workin since the nineties 
All this coke out here you workin, yo, ass off 
To buy some name brand shit you smarter than that dog 
Been in the hood, like 20 years at least 
And still tryna keep peace, wit niggas dat, keep piece. 
Niggas ain't tryna hear you sobbin chief 
I need to eat, run up on son and rob his lease. 
Jack boys rob meals from a slum dog 
Smarten up just the hood that I'm from dog 
 
The lavish life 
Livin wrong, hopin that the path is right, 
Ye and hov told us this can't be life 
Getting. All I want hopin that I had it twice. 
A lot a livin to do before I die they on my fire 
That burns and pass the mike 
Ye and hov told us. This can't be life 
Livin wrong, hopin that the path is right. The path is right
