Don't Wanna Go Away Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man 
They just don't understand, 
Though young, I'm still a man. 
Noone can tell me. I don't need you here in my life, 
They call it puppy, love, 
But. I'Ve lived long enough. 
To know these feelings I feel are for real to me 
And. I know I ...

1-, Don't wan na go away, 
I really wan na stay with you 
But, I don't have no say 
For. All we have is today 
Said all we have today, 
 
Lil'Man 
They, think it's easy to 
Just pack, our bags and move 
They just don't know that it means 
So much more to me. 
Know. If I had my way, 
There would never come a day. 
That I'd. Allow us to be so far apart 
And, I know I ...

2-, Don't wan na go away, 
I really wan na stay with you 
But, I don't have no say 
For. All we have is today 
 
Lil'Man 
I, just keep on looking up in the sky. 
Fighting back the tears 
That keep coming to my eyes, 
Really hoping to catch me. A falling star 
To make a wish upon 
And change. The way things are make it stop. 
 
Lil'Man 
Said, all we have is today 
Said. All we have is today
