A Song For The Deaf Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


Nobody's coming down the hall.
Nobody echoes in my head.
Broken reflection out of luck.
Nobody ever needed it.

I got what was.
I want to take what's left.

Beautiful senses are gone.
Canary in a gilded cage.
Singing.
Sweet, soft, and low.
I will poison you all.
Come closer, racing to your tongue.

No talk will cure.
What's lost, or save what's left.

The blind can go get fucked.
Lie beside the ditch.
This halo round my neck.
Has torn out every stitch.

Who are you hiding.
Is it safe for the deaf.
Beautiful cancer.
Infiltrate and forget.
When I saw you coming.
And I heard not a thing.
A mistake not to listen.
When I knew where you'd been.
