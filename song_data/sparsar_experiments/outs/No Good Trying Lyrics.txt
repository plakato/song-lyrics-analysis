No Good Trying Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

It's no good trying to place your hand.
Where I can't see, because I understand.
That you're different from me.
Yes, I can tell that you can't be what you pretend.
And you're rocking me backwards and you're rocking towards.
The red and yellow mane of a stallion horse.

It's no good trying to place your hand.
Where I can't see, because I understand.
That you're different from me.
Yes, I can tell that you can't be what you pretend.
The caterpillar hood won't cover the head of you.
Know you should be home in bed.

It's no good holding your sequin fan.
Where I can't see, because I understand.
That you're different from me.
Yes, I can tell that you can't be what you pretend.
Yes, you're spinning around and around in a car.
With electric lights flashing very fast.
