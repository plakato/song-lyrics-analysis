Too Late Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Well, it's too late for walking in the middle.
Too late to try.
Yes, it's too late for sitting in the balance.
No more middle line.

Oh, it's too late for walking on fences.
Time to choose your side.
Yes, it's too late for flirtin' with the darkness.
Make up your mind.

Oh, the time has come for making a decision.
And you say you've found the light.
But the talk is cheap when I see the way you're living.
Walking in the night.

Well, it's too late for walking in the middle.
Too late to try.
Yes, it's too late for sitting in the balance.
No more middle line.

Oh, it's too late for thinking you can walk the middle line....
Better get wise.

You may think that you can live by your feelings.
Different every night.
But an emotional religion will crumble at our feet.
If we're made to stand and fight.

Well, it's too late for walking on fences.
Time to choose you side.
Yes, it's too late for flirtin' with the darkness.
Make up your mind.

Well, it's too late for thinking you can walk the middle line....
Better get wise.

Well, it's too late for walking in the middle.
Too late to try.
Yes, it's too late for sitting in the balance.
No more middle line.

Oh, it's too late for walking on fences.
Time to choose your side.
Yes, it's too late for flirtin' with the darkness.
Please make up your mind.

Well, it's too late for walking in the middle.
Too late to try.
Yes, it's too late for sitting in the balance.
No more middle line.

Oh, it's too late for walking on fences.
Time to choose your side.
Yes, it's too late for flirtin' with the darkness.
Please make up your mind.
