Special Plates Lyrics
by Rumi.

Notice how each particle moves.
Notice how everyone has just arrived here.
From a journey.
Notice how each wants a different food.
Notice how the stars vanish as the sun comes up.
And how all streams stream toward the ocean.

Look at the chefs preparing special plates.
For everyone, according to what they need.
Look at this cup that can hold the ocean.
Look at those who see the face.
Look through Shams' eyes.
Into the water that is.
Entirely jewels.
