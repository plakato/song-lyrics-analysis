Funny Lyrics
by 3LW.

Funny how, love feels.
Funny how, love can be.
Funny how, love feels.
Feels.

I didn't know til today.
I could get hurt so easily.
But now I realize.

And I almost cried.
Why must you go.
Can't you stay.
I wish you could be here everyday.
Holdin me close to you.

To say goodbye.

Ain't it funny how.
Love can bring you down.
Cause you know somethings wrong yeah.
Then you turn around.
Suddenly you found.
That your love keeps you strong.
So you can hold on.

Funny how love can be so wrong so wrong.
Funny how love can be, can be so right.

I didn't think about it much.
I didn't know the meaning of.
Giving my heart away.

You feel the same oh.
And now I know that love is true.
And I don't wanna be here without you.
Whenever you're near or far.

Right here in my heart.

Feel like you can't go on.

That your love keeps you strong so you can go on.

Funny how love can be so wrong so wrong sometimes.
Funny how love can be so right so right.
Funny how love can be so wrong so wrong sometimes.
Funny how love can be so right.

Its hard to understand love sometimes.
It can hurt you, and sometimes it can feel so right.

Funny how love can be so wrong so wrong sometimes.
Funny how love can be so right.
Funny how love can be so wrong so wrong sometimes.
Funny how love can be, can be so right.
Funny how love can be so wrong so wrong sometimes.
Funny how love can be, can be so right.

Funny how, love feels.
Funny how, love can be.
Funny how, love feels.
Feels.

Funny funny funny funny.

Funny how, love feels.
Funny how, love can be.
Funny how, love feels.
Feels.

How love makes your feel crazy.

Funny how, love feels.
Funny how, love can be.
Funny how, love feels.
Feels.
