Unwelcomed Lyrics
by Zip K..


I tell the competition.
Bueno noches.
The shit I write is poetry.
Pimpin only I talk a nun into adultery.
I from where the OGs sit on the porches.
And they smoke the whole shit.
I mean extinguishing the roaches.
I been on a motion to lift the culture.
But watch how you approach we still lift the toaster.
Tell my bitch to hit the Kroger and tip the grocer.
Birkin heavy on her shoulder she tippin over.
Only answer to Jehovah.
I thought ya told.
So much range it's a shame I ain't gotta Rover.
All my niggas shop with Lucky.
Like we got a clover.
All the youngings think I'm east Atlanta's Cosa Nostra.
I maneuver so kosher amongst the vultures.
But this lack of trust make me antisocial.
And I don't seem to fit in with the other locals.
I gotta keep these doors open to get some closure.

Cause we might cuz we might kill ya then go pick ya bitch up.
Front you for a price and hit the switch up.
Might rob ya for ya whole fucking zip up.
Come around real niggas might get ya, nigga.
My side.
This is how we are on my side.
We do not fuck around on my side.
You do not come around if you ain't from my side.
Cause we might cause we might.
Kill ya then go pick ya bitch up.
Charge you for a price and hit the switch up.
Might rob ya for ya whole fucking zip up.
Come around real niggas might get ya.

I tell my opposition bueno dias.
Come meet a genius.
Need my dough thick.
We can't no do no.
Little Caesars.
My predicament the meanest.
I can't believe this.
They done booked my nigga Bam dem encyclopedias.
I so happen came out clean as some white Adidas.
If I make enough cream.
Then it might can feed us.
Till them other niggas bitter as some lemon squeezes.
That's the same shit trigger all the.
Trigger squeezing aye.
Got dammit I done found my niche.
Lil bitch.
Juugin till a nigga.
Eatin Krispy Kreme donuts doin donuts in a 6.
In Zone 6.
Oh lord, I done loss my innocents for the Benjamins.
All my niggas into shit no coincidence.
And the house ain't on a hill, ain't no picket fence.
Welcome to it.
