Could It Be You (Fortyleg Bite) Lyrics
by Zoe.

Could it be you featuring ky-Mani marley.

For such a long time there was nobody.
I had only myself to please.
I never needed anyone at all.
Then you came - it felt like a breeze.
A breeze of sunshine and a breath of light.
Suddenly I knew I was wrong.
My heart beats faster, what a nice surprise.
I'll be holdin' on....
... Feels like I knew you before.
Feels like there's a treat in store.
It happened just overnight.
I cannot wait anymore.
It feels so naturally right.

Could it be you, baby, that I was searchin' for.
Could it be you, baby, who makes me search no more.
Could it be you, baby, that I was lookin' for.
Could it be you, could it be true, could it be you.
Could this be love now, between you and me.
Do I care? I do possibly.
And all that matters is you bein' there for me.
Feed my dream of eternity.
I wanna know you like I know myself.
Make me feel like nobody else.
You give me freedom, make me act so strong.
I'll be holdin' on....
... Feels like I knew you before.
Feels like there's a treat in store.
It happened just overnight.
I cannot wait anymore.
It feels so naturally right.

Am I dreamin or is this reality.
Havin you right next to me.
What is the meaning of this feel I feel.
Could it mean that this love is real.
I was lost on a lonely road.
Prayin for some peace, for some guide.
Youre like an angel on a ray of light.
There you were in front of my eyes.
... Feels like I knew you before.
Feels like there's a treat in store.
It happened just overnight.
I cannot wait anymore.
It feels so naturally right.
