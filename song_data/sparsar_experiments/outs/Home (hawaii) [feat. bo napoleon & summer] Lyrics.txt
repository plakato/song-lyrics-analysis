Home (hawaii) [feat. bo napoleon & summer] Lyrics
by Awa.

Heading back home, all packed up, yeah, About to hit the.
Road.
I don't need much, got the sounds turned up.
I'm on cruise control.
I wanna see my fams, catch some waves, yeah.
I need to charge the soul.
Fire up the bar-b, jam Bob Marley.
And sing along.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
I don't wanna wait in vain, no, no.
And I think to myself, as I look around.
Just how lucky I am, ooh yeah.

To be right here  without a care in the world.

And I'm sippin' on a beer with Katchafire on the radio.
On that good vibe, having good times.
in the place I call home.

2 :.

Fresh off the plane, on the way to the Westside.
Feelin' alright.
Stare into nowhere, at the light make a quick right.
Nanakuli e'a.
And I live in a place so far away.
But this still my home.
Hawaiian boy, raised with aloha.
You can call me home grown.
O ka leo , O ka manu.
E ho'i mai e pili.
And I think to myself.
As I look around, just how lucky I am …

Just to be right here  without a care in the.
World.
My bottle green with The Green on the radio.
Having good times, feel them good vibes.
in the place I call my home, Hawai'i.

There's only one place I call home.
There's only one place that I know.
To get that ‘One Love' feeling.
No matter how long I'm away.
It's where my heart will always stay, everyday.

Right here  without a care in the world, no.
Sittin on the beach with Fiji on the radio.
On that good vibe, having good times.
It's the good life in the place I call home.

:.

To be right here  without a care in the world.

And I'm sippin' on a beer with Katchafire on the radio.
On that good vibe, having good times.
in the place I call home.
