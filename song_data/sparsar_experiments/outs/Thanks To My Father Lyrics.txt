Thanks To My Father Lyrics
by Quan.

James' Dodgers Yo
 growing up, sucked ass thanks
to, my damn dad/ kid born with
cancer and no damn dad how sad/
tried being in my life, but you is just a bother/, looked in the mirror. I look like my fucking father
/, my friends ask and I try to
just hide you/. I'M pass hate
nigga yo two son's just despise you/ I try to comprehend the lies. You tell me/, but my hatred
is. What ties you/ our
relationship is shit on a chop. Stick a pic with me and you in it nigga just crop it/! Stop it. I love you like racist love, chocolate/, you left more scars, then this knife in my
pocket/ fuck, you no excuses
for your actions. All you do is
smoke. I fucking hate you with a passion/ hate to see you smile and I hate to see you laughing
/ can't wait to see you in
that fucking coffin that you passed in 
, 
 Quan, Hey dad what the fuck, what you really do to me/ you got my
mind fucked Up jagged off brutally/ blowing loud in my face and told me not to fucking smoke/
I inhale. It now guess who's smoking then/ seriously. Speaking on a high fact
the day, you wasn't there, I put the world on it's damn back/, you think you
strong. You think you can really see/ i'll make you go blind, Stevie/ dumb
enough to think moving was a good choice/ aye dad man, you ain't, really do shit
for me/. I can name what you gave me in my whole life/ less then three fingers
counting down from two hands: 
 
, James' Dodgers, Dad
as, my logo, a picking up, promo/ I'll, come and see you net week, yo ass, is
just, a no show/ smoke, weed get
drunk with fake promises/ I'Ll
Beat you to the ground with rhymes and my dominance/ talk a lot of shit and stay cocky like cutter
/, didn't have a dad just
depended on my brother/ James'
is. The second born won't ever be another/, wrap it up and fuck this game. I call it burning. Rubber
 
 Quan, When I was born, my dad played a little game. Called/'Ding dong
ditch'/, my mom was a living bell/. My dad tried to play her wrong/ till she
caught him like she caught me playing with my other arm/. When I was young my
thought, he was the ruler/ until he had a dream that I was frozen in a cooler/
no. Emotions lost new emotions gain/ because the sadness of a boy became the
madness of a man/. No man in my life to tell me what its really like/ just burn
shit kick cats to relax/ like bad breath with tic-tacs that don't match that
come in really small packs. Like/, don't cry! Now, when I cut yo dick off and feed
it to you on the slide on the playground/ aye dad, I thought you had my fucking
back/, I'm ya. Son now here comes the side effect: 
 
, James' Dodgers I'm
back on the track with a ax that goes smack/ attack with pro-bats and wack. My dad's cat/, a man with burnt stacks, could bring
yo hurt back/ it's like
Whitney and Bobby split the dirt crack/ uh. My dad will say, but not mention/, he bought himself a phone but can't afford to pay attention/, just listen its truth. Its not dissing you
can, take it personal, but I just need my distance/ hey. What'S that its dad with no since its/ time to be
a man and stop yo ho bitching/
stop quieting just stand and stop sitting/. You claim that you a dog, but you resemble from a kitten
/ Quan, taught me to grow from
my mistakes, its no shit I'mma
take/ from you. For heavens, sake's/ you'll, probably over, wait for me to come and say/ that I
will conversant with you/ to fucking late uh/. I hope you die with blades in ya eye and wings that
make you fly, get ripped like tore, nigh/ yous, a bitch, don't care what I tend! To/, the shit that
I've done, don't even care what I been through/ wan na help us out now, don't even bother/ I'mma say it one time I don't fucking have
a father, ..., Bitch
