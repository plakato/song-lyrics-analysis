And When Lyrics
by Rx.

Are you home?
Are you home?
Are you there?

And when you pray.
I'll pray with you.
And when you sleep.
Then I'll sleep too.

And when you read the book.
I'll read it too.
And if you lie to me.
I'll find you.

Are you home?
Are you there?

And when you walk the streets.
I'll walk with you.
And when you're looking from.
I'll look in too.

And when you close the door.
Be very sure you do.
And when you re-awake.
Then this will all be true.

And when you hear of me.
You will understand.
And when you feel the dirt.
I will wash my hands.

And in that special place.
I'll keep apart from you.
That's where I'll find myself.
The piece I kept from you.

Are you home?
Are you there?
