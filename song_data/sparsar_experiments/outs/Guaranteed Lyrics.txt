Guaranteed Lyrics
by Virtuoso.

{*scratching: Yo I got a bigger plan*}.

Virtuoso.
Yea yea check it out, uhh.
Aiyo yo.
You now in tune with the Virtuoso.
I don't preach or pose.
I teach those who head the flows.

Yo this cat slangs so much he speaks dope.
So each quote is worth the geeno.
For kicks give free coke to chicks for deep throat.
From sleep walking for days.
Dreamt that he was broke but he's paid.
He hopes for the days when the evil life will feed his wife.
Smoking the haze and peaceful pipes is rolled and jokers is jays.
?? with razor blades.
Business fell because of a major raid in Mexico.
And right then he knew he was next to go.
Everyone knows do the crime do the time.
Behind the wall he's lifting weights and flexes.
So by the time he gets out his pecks will grow.
His bid was a breeze he got an extra giving him weed sex and doe.
He bought a Lex and lay low heard about a major deal for yayo.
And couldn't say no so he got slayed slow.
They choked eighty breathes from his throat while his lady slept.
And his baby wept the shiesty business brings a shady death.

You gotta know how to grow where the soils tough.
If you want G's by the G's like a oil rush.
Chase your dreams keep you're spare clean never soil it up.
And you'll be guaranteed to win like a royal flush.

Virtuoso.

Cam cording chicks whose whole steez is modeling.
His man starting fix through four g's were waddling.
A problem that's soon solved revolver shell shoted him.
His fam filled his coffin with jewelery.
Parents held hands while they talked in his eulogy.
Came in the form of a ride from his little brother.
Who swore he know the killers mind with a clip of thunder.
He given other clicks chips for info.
Watching' which way the wind blow from his window.
As he kept his eye on the block.
Found the liars that popped the shots.
Was his brother's crew who fired the Glock.
He got wired and hot dropped the top dog.
Got him and shot him but the problem was that the cops saw.
Now his parents wonder why the failed.
One son done by gun the other one hung with life in jail.

You got to know how to grow where the soils tough.
If you want G's by the G's like a oil rush.
Chase your dreams keep you're spare clean never soil it up.
And you'll be guaranteed to win like a royal flush.

You got to know how to grow where the soils tough.
If you want G's by the G's like a oil rush.
Chase your dreams keep you're spare clean never soil it up.
And you'll be guaranteed to win like a royal flush.

Virtuoso.
This is dedicated to shady ladies who have babies.
And cats just to flash the Mercedes and stash the gravy.
And maybe it couple of back stabbing people who tried to play me.
They couldn't fade me they only made me stronger life is crazy.
Like an animal with rabies - today? Miguel's running the mic.
But I been waiting all my life for cats to pay me.
Words felt like ??? Now that the worlds shady like Hades.
Respect my ladies save me from being lazy.
So I praise the lord for the friends of my life afraid and torn.
I stay in form and thank the one for the day I was born.
Blunts and crazy sess lay and wonder why the babies wept.
Why they spraying thunder so they may be wet.
I say we get moving and shaking making connections.
With every section of our mother earth for her protection.
Cause monetary divisions industrial prisons.
And racism only lead to a global cataclysm.

You got to know how to grow where the soils tough.
If you want G's by the G's like a oil rush.
Chase your dreams keep you're spare clean never soil it up.
And you'll be guaranteed to win like a royal flush.

You got to know how to grow where the soils tough.
If you want G's by the G's like a oil rush.
Chase your dreams keep you're spare clean never soil it up.
And you'll be guaranteed to win like a royal flush.

Yea yea... Big Virtuoso.
