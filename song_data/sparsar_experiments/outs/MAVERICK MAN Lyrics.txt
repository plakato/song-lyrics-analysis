MAVERICK MAN Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.

Love games got me guessin.
Stressin.
Fessin up.
Dressin up.
For some chick.
Something something.
Rhyme with dick.
You know me by now.
Never comin down.
On the ground.
Wow.
He never slows down.
Speak thru it all.
Face in a frown.
Maverick man.
Comin to town.
Get fuckin down.
Now.
Not even brown.
White boy.
Causin trouble.
Seein double.
Wubble.
Some bass.
Zippo raid.
Strikes again.
Not doin time in the pen.
Fuck my friends.
Just me then.
The kinda man u dont wanna be.
But i can't see the light.
So im gonna be me.
Just wanna drink and fuck all night.
It's my plight.
Irish &amp; white.
MC stunna like i'm gunna.
Collapse.
The whole buildin.
Adrenaline thrillin.
Man killin.
Dangerous game.
Clinically insane.
Cut out my brain.
Ignore the pain.
Jack daniels.
Chuggit.
Fuck it.
Get in the car.
Lug it.
Interstate.
Swervin lanes.
Flip the tape.
Hydroplane.
Crash.
Dash.
Wipe the fingerprints from the scene.
Flee.
Capn murphys all they got on me.
But he's an artist.
And i just started.
In a few years.
Gonna go far.
Than planets an stars.

Check these bars.
