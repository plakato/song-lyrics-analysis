You Got It All Lyrics
by Union J.


Some people got soul.
Some people got passion.
Some people got wisdom.
But you got it all.
Some people got strength.
Some people got courage.
Some people got vision.
But you got it all.
Some people got drive.
Some people got talent.
Some people got style.
But you got it all.
Some people live life.
Some people stay balanced.
You're everything I ever want in a girl.

Cause you got it all.
Cause you got it all.
You got it all.

And I want all of it.
Every little bit of all of it.

Some people got curves.
Some people got beauty.
That's deeper than words.
But you got it all.
Some people get wild.
Some people stay classy.
You're everything I ever want in a girl.

So don't you change a thing.
Cause I like everything about you.
From your hazy toes, from your lips to your nose.
All perfect in my eyes.

Some people got soul.
Some people got passion.
Some people got heart.
But you got it all.

Cause you got it all.
Cause you got it all.

Some people got soul.
Some people got passion.
Some people got wisdom.
But you got it all.

Some people got strength.
Some people got courage.
Some people got vision.
But you got it all.

Cause you got it all, ooh yeah.
You got it all.
