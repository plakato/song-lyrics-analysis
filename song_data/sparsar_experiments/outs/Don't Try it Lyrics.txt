Don't Try it Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..

{ Tec-9 Talking } 
We bout to fuck em up with this one baby, 
Say no mo *gun cocks*, say no mo *gun cocks* 
 
F-L to the E-X-I-S Flexis nigga, Mother, fucka whats next 
Yall niggas wan na know what the truth is. 
It is what it is. Blazin South we handelin biz 
Hold down blocks with shotty's spark it up in the dark, 
Keep bitches to riches, dump ya body in the rivah 
Hustle all night. My goal is to win the battle 
Schemin on a chicken pickin on a meal ticket 
Dont make the Capital get wicked. 
Some of this shit is not even listed. 
Hennessy keeps me blisted 
Worth a nigga layed fa fuckin, with my Yola 
Nigga out there bad sold a nigga, Baking Soda 
I. Guess he never heard about the backgrounds of Tec 
Took, a big chunk, a meat out the head and neck 
Reckless when I'm drunk livin on the edge 
But. I pledge to keep you motha fuckas crunk 
Sinista got the funk and we got 5 albums 
Plus a new release, SHUT YA MOUTH
