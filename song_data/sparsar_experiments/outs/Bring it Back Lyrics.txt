Bring it Back Lyrics
by UNK.

DJ Montay.
Yeah, one time, it's ya boi DJ Montay right.
We got a brand new dance comin for you.
I don't care if you from the East coast, West coast.
Midwast, down South, but when that beat drop.
You gotta be on point - bring it back.
Top Quality Productions, Oomp Camp~!
DJ Unk, tell 'em how to do it shorty.

Unk.
Catch the beat like me, bounce your body like this.
You can do it by yourself, go on and bounce on that bitch.
I'm so fresh out the press, Grey Goose on the rocks.
Bring it back, hit the stage with my balm in my socks.
Now these hoes wanna jock, hear my song so they cop.
Lean your shoulders to the beat and if you can't you need to stop.
Everybody bring it back like the trap, set up shop.
Fuck a hater, youse a snitch, you a flashlight cop.
Bring it back in the Chevy, leanin in the droptop.
Smokin purp', watch 'em work, you can bounce, you can rock.
Lean back like the Maybach, cool and relaxed.
Now they see I'm certified, dig him bitch, yeah we back.
Hey, now bring it back.

bring it back, bring it back.
Bring it back, bring it back.
Catch the beat like this  bring it back, bring it back.
Bring it back, bring it back.
Catch the beat like this  bring it back, bring it back.
Bring it back, bring it back.
Catch the beat like this  bring it back, bring it back.
Bring it back, bring it back.

Unk.
You ridin big? Bring it back! Hit the mall, jump fresh.
Spend a stack - bring it back! Hit the club, sippin Goose.
And the 'gnac - bring it back! Throwin up my hood niggas.
Where you at? Bring it back! Smokin kush, gettin head.
In the 'llac - bring it back! Hell naw, fuck that.
Break your back - bring it back! Bounce with it, lean with it.
Ride that - bring it back! DJ Montay on the track.
Bring it back, bring it back - Westside, Bankhead.
Bring it back, bring it back - in Decatur where it's greater.
Bring it back, bring it back - ridin down MLK.
Bring it back, bring it back - on that L, might as well.
Bring it back, bring it back - ATL e'rybody like this.

DJ Montay.
Aight, aight, aight, aight.
Some of y'all know what I'm talkin 'bout out there.
Some of y'all don'.
I got my partner DJ Unk right, that's about to tell y'all how this thing go.
DJ Unk... ah crank 'em up!

Unk.
Now crank it up  crank it up.
Bounce with it, lean with it, crank it up.
Now ride out  now ride out.
Now bring it back to the beat ride out.
Now catch the beat, catch the beat like this.
If you can't bounce, don't bounce, just quit.
Now bring it back  now bring it back.
Now run for it like this, bring it back, catch the beat like this.
