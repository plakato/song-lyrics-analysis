Holy Cola Lyrics
by Two Crown King.

Shady eyes, weak knees, shift shaky and unsure 
It's funny how the one cut is anything but pure 
My league's, dress code is snow and so I've become stirred 
I'm, leaving with one leaf left., Leaving it unturned. 
And still I can't es-cape or avoid it 
Cause. Half the demographic that I run with enjoys it 
And half of that half-pack sacks for employment, 
They used to work a week to make the paper they enjoyed it with 
 
I used to push it'till the the right spot. 
We'Ve got a couple different reasons'till. The heart stops 
And at that moment, when you own it all for free 
If, there are limits to forgiveness or there's none., So wait and see 
See. It'S never been easy and I've known to be wrong and by 
\- 
It still feeds on me daily.. I ain't afraid to fess up 
But better, yet I'd rather give it away then give in again 
 
Well I'd love to love to let it go 
I'd love to â€“ love to let it go. 
 
Well, I'd love to love to let it go 
But. This car won't stop or start to slow 
At. This speed, I believe, we're going to break for sure. 
God got ta find a way for me to let it go. 
 
I never asked for nothing.. I never wanted squat 
You call it hustlin' cause. You think hustlin's awful hot 
You call it making moves and I call it standing still. 
I keep a couple coins and you keep ruber-banding bills 
And. Now it seems as if death is always two fold on the table.
