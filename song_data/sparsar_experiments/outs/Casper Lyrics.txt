Casper Lyrics
by Russian Red.

There was one and there were two.
And then I probably lost the count.
But I can't even see their faces.
Can't remember how they sound.
And the sweetest of their smell was.
Always something kind off dark.
That's the good love coming for you.
It will give you good advice.

Nobody, nobody, nobody ever does.

Nobody, nobody, nobody ever does.

And all the boys and all the girls are doing fine.
Cause they have trust and.
Don't need to pray for all their lives.
But older people seem to worry they feel sorry for a time.
If only I could find the way I could be sleeping by your side.
By your side, oh your side is home to me.

Nobody, nobody, nobody ever does.

Nobody, nobody, nobody ever does.

Everyday, every.... day.
There was one and there were two;.
And then I probably lost the count.
