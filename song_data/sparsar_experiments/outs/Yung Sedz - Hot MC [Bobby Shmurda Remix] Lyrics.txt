Yung Sedz - Hot MC [Bobby Shmurda Remix] Lyrics
by Yung Sedz.

I been spitting on grime since like the 5th grade.
I'm used to getting rep and now I'm used to getting paid.
Got bare love for the scene but now some shit has gotta change.
Cause some dead MC's are at the top and that is kinda strange.
Send for any culture, but this ain't no French exchange.
I'm talking bout dissing any rapper that's finna come my way.
Fetty Wap, baby won't you come way.
If a hot nigga comes my way then you know I'll have to spray.
And I ain't talking bout going to no toilet.
Have you running quicker than Junior Hoillet.
Blood everywhere, top goes white to red, your √Ångel now.
Piss me off get slapped back to '04, Lethal Bizzle, Pow.
Have to take a quick breather now.
Cause what I spat was so real you might catch a fever now.
Take a break sit on the bench, I'm Nasri now.
Can't lie that I knew a few snakes Van Persie wow.
And you best know that I'm 100% a red.
And I'm talking bout Manny so fuck Tevez.
Wait, I'm getting a bit off track like I crashed.
I'll end your career put it in a mufucking body-bag.
