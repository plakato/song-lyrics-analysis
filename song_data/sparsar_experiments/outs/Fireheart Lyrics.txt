Fireheart Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


I was ready from the minute that I saw you on the cover of the magazine.
It felt like looking in the mirror at a paper face familiar to my everything.
I just had to call you up.
You just had to pick it up.
We had all the love that we need.
Get some pages.
Get em' turning.
I could feel the fire burning over you and me.

There's a fire in my heart for you.
And when I feel it all night.
I don't know what to do.
There's a fire in my heart for you.
Am I gold for you, am I gold?

Now you see I've got a ticket to fly and to find you walking 'round your.
neighbourhood.
Running round in circles into people into places, where you live and love.
Friends they could just put us down.
But we could pass that book around.
We have everything understood.
I'm hopin' that I see you round.
Cause when I make the calls you never pick them up.

There's a fire in my heart for you.
And when I feel it all night.
I don't know what to do.
There's a fire in my heart for you.
Am I gold for you, am I gold?

I'm sorry that I shocked you when you walked into your bedroom as I waited for.
you.
The blade you put into my heart just kept the fire burning through the.
afternoon.

There's a fire in my heart for you.
And when I feel it all night.
I don't know what to do.
There's a fire in my heart for you.
Am I gold for you, am I gold?
