DFWM Lyrics
by Tyler Gary.


Why the flow so buttery?
Titties in my face and I think they trynna smother me.
Tyler with a space then you can add another G.
Life is just a race and you are not in front of me.
Yo, why the fuck I feel so lonely?
I guess I miss Karina always holding me... down.
I guess she left a hole in me.
Cause every girl I meet I just seem to tune... out.
Fuck it, it's me against the world til I learn to kick the bucket.
Sock ya in the gums if ya makin them assumptions.
Cause the mouth is not a leg, you should not use it for runnin'.
hurry. somebody. quote that.
Throw it on your Thursday's throwback.
Tag TG so they know that....
This is no crap....
This is how you stuff your mind with more facts.

Don't fuck with me.
Don't do it.
Don't fuck with me.
Don't do it.

Back in the all black slacks hitting wax.
Competition says I'm dope.
But i will not say it back.
And the second that I don't.
They are ready to attack.
But I'm aiming at their throats.
With a golden picket axe.
I'm just trynna hit 'em back.
I ain't ever falling first.
I can handle the impact.
Now they're laying on they're back.
The result is similar to 27 heart attacks.

Don't fuck with me.
Don't do it.
Don't fuck with me.
Don't do it.

Live and direct from the land of the mist.
Where the sky isn't blue but the culture is crisp.
She don't have a dude but still blows me a kiss.
She's a thot, she's a hoe, she's a tramp, she's a bitch.
Don't fuck with me.
Cause I got a lot of bucks with me.
This is give no fuck city....
I'm the mayor, also known as the annihilator.
Fine honey dip slayer then I'm like see you later.

Don't fuck with me.
Don't do it.
Don't fuck with me.
Don't do it.
