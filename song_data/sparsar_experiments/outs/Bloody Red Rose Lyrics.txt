Bloody Red Rose Lyrics
by Running Wild.

In the war of the roses, the tragedy source.
King Edward was bound to die.
Richard III the new lord protector.
Ruled with loyalty me lie.
A vigilant guardian to the sons of the king.
As sure as an eagle will fly.
He died in a battle in 1485.
And Henry defamed Richard with lies.

Richard was charged in the act of attainder.
With tyranny, murder and gain.
Henry revoked the titulus regulas.
With the smile of the vicious insane.
Henry that rotten bastard.
Executed the whole house of York.
Elizabeth Woodville was for life.
And Tyrrel the liar was aquitted by court.

The poisoned thorns of the bloody red rose.
Red venom of deepest dye.
Henry the traitor, the victor by sin.
Soiled Richard's blood with a grin.

While Richard was ruling, the boys were alive.
When he died the boys disappeared.
Henry killed them to get onto the throne.
But the book of truth was sealed.
Henry paid Tyrrel to say that he had murdered.
In the name of Sir Richard the brave.
Henry killed Tyrrel without any trial.
So Tyrrel took the truth to his grave.

The poisoned thorns of the bloody red rose.
Red venom of deepest dye.
Henry the traitor, the victor by sin.
Soiled Richard's blood with a grin.
The poisoned thorns of the bloody red rose.
Red venom of deepest dye.
Henry the traitor, the victor by sin.
Soiled Richard's blood with a grin.
