Passing Through A Screen Door Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.


Cigarette smoke dances back in the window.
And I can see the haze on its own light.
I'm conjuring ghosts on a forty hour ride home.
And they keep asking me what I'm doing with my life.

Interlude.
While my cousins go to bed with their wives.
I'm feeling like I've fallen behind.

Well, the highway won.
I'm listening to traffic reports one on one.
Coming quietly undone.
I was born to run.
Away from anything good.
An escape artist's son.
Sun-drenched pavement in my blood.

Interlude.
The first thing that I do when I walk in is find a way out for when shit gets.
bad and.

I've been looking for.
Tears in the screen door.
I've been waiting for.
Another disaster.

Well I'm terrified.
Like a kid in the sixties.
Staring at the sky.
Waiting for the bomb to fall.
And it's all a lie.
What they say about stability.
It scares me sometimes.
The emptiness I see in my eyes.

Interlude.
And all the kids names I've ever liked are tied to tragedy.
And I don't want my children growing up to be anything like me.

I've been looking for.
Tears in the screen door.
I've been waiting for.
Another disaster.
And I was kinda hoping you'd say.
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.

I keep a flashlight.
And a small knife.
In the corner of my bed stand.
I keep a flashlight.
And the train times.
But you wouldn't understand.
How could you understand?
Jesus Christ, I'm twenty-six.
All the people I've graduated with.
All have kids.
All have wives.
All have people who care if they come home at night.
Well, Jesus Christ, did I fuck up?

I've been looking for.
Tears in the screen door.
I've been waiting for.
Another disaster.
And I was kinda hoping you'd say.
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
