9 To Ya Dome Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.

~fire beat plays for a whole minute~.

9 to your dome, hoe.
Now you gone hope.
Nigga cause you dont know.
But you gon' find out.
Walking with my nine out.
I shoot his spine out.
Roll up a blunt, now I'm flying out.
Nine to your dome nigga, give me what you own nigga.
I ain't playin with you, whip your head with the chrome nigga.
Came with a team, but I left.
him with his own niggas.
Signing rappers, so I guess that I'm a grown nigga.
Im gunning rappers, so I guess that I'm a murderer.
Blood on my pants, I got blood on my Jordans, bruh.
Nine to your dome, send that nigga running home, cuh.
This ain't what they want, whip, whip 'em with the chrome.
Dip, dip yes I'm gon' sip,.
sip I'm on Patron.
Take his girl to my home, and thats where she give me dome.
Uh I'm disgusted, this weed very musty.
Nine to his head, cause I don't trust him.
BRAP.
