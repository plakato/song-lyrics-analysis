Lyrics.

Memories keep us alive and arriving on time.
To a show like mine to find you love music too bitch.
You use it for guidance and to prove shit is truly true shit.
Fuse it with dank weed and your two true friends.
Cruising with speed cause Eazy E said fuck police!
So no stopping us we got all that we need.
Too escape you bitch.

Thinking bout flying to LA to start young with this music.
Friends say that I'm dope when I flow but I need Jesus.
For me it's therapeutic and keeps me movin'.
And if I'm caged like Truman I might just lose it.
And if you snooze you lose bitch, so no damn snoozin'!
