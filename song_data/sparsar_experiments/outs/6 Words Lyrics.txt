6 Words Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


I can't sing but I wrote you a song, yeah.
Wrong notes but the melody's so clear.
When I'm lost, I'm still close to gold cause I found my treasure in.
you.
And that's priceless spending, now.
let me count my blessings.

1 life, 2 children.
3 time, 4 dreaming.
5 senses, 6 words.
I found my treasure in you.

And that's priceless spending, now let me count my blessings.

In you.
I found my treasure in you.

Bronze, silver, gold... no, it's you.
I found my treasure in you.
Nothing less than that will do.
Cause I found my treasure in you.

I can't sing but I wrote you a song, yeah.
