That Smell Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Whiskey bottles, and brand new cars.
Oak tree you're in my way.
There's too much coke and.
too much smoke.
Look what's going on inside you.
Ooooh that smell.
Can't you smell that smell.
Ooooh that smell.
The smell of death surrounds you.

Angel of darkness is upon you.
Stuck a needle in your arm.
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose.
One more drink, fool, will drown you.
Ooooh that smell.
Can't you smell that smell.
Ooooh that smell.
The smell of death surrounds you.

Now they call you Prince Charming.
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes.
Say you'll be alright come tomorrow.
But tomorrow might not be here for you.

Ooh, that smell.
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell.
The smell of death surrounds you.

Aw, you fool, you.
You stick them needles in your arm.
I know I been there before.

One little problem that confronts you.
Got a monkey on your back.
Just one more fix Lord, might do the trick.
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks.

Ooh, that smell.
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell.
The smell of death surrounds you.

Ooh, that smell.
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell.
The smell of death surrounds you.

Oh, you fool, you.
Don't stick those needles in your arm.
You're just a fool, just a fool, just a fool.
