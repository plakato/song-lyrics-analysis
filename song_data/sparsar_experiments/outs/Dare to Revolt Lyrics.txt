Dare to Revolt Lyrics
by ZSK.

Are you thinking or just receiving information?
Are you acting or just following up?
Do you think you change the world by watching.
Pretending that finally someone will do something.

Fuck that brainwashed corporate media-bullshit.

We got a lot to say! We got a lot to do!
We got a lot to say! We got a lot to do!

Independent media, the first step to raise our Voice.
But that presupposes your support!
You got the chance to change the world.
It is up to you!
