CS Fly Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


*Shoutouts and shit talk*.

Two thirds whattup.
We started out this shit was rough.
But now I'm smooth can't get enough.
We coming up that's the stuff.
In the lab making murder mindless.
But it gets timeless.
Now you're being blinded by European diamonds.
Get behind me if you wanna last.
Cause artists come and go the shit is fast.
Take a look in the past and check it.
I'm serving up like breakfast.
Young Spiz I'm the freshest refreshing.
Rap is like a blessing.
I get success and I get to resting.
Not with me you should be messing.
You don't get two first impressions.
That's a lesson.
Don't test my finesse just invest in it.
Like I do.
When they say you're fly they point at me and not at you.
So don't give me that attitude.
I reach a point at any latitude.
It's Young Spiz you know I stay so factual.

I guess they wanna see us fly.
Ah, ah, ah, I guess they wanna see us fly.
It's Triple T man I guess they wanna see us fly.
Ah, ah, ah, I guess they wanna see us fly.

I'm so complex.
My black hole vortex.
Means more stress.
I wake up like the last one left.
Nightmares in the middle of the day.
But I never fall asleep.
Cause resting leads to your dismay.
Call me loco but I know what I'm talking about.
You heard through a cousin with a leaking mouth.
Run away from my cats like a freaking mouse.
Now we gotta set traps with dollars all around my house.
And that's not the half of it.
The other fifty percent.
They really love it.
So I told 'em pop shove it.
Turned from the rubbish into something you could covet.
Cracks on my screen.
Reading raps about no bagels but cheese and cream.
My goals in life have never once been clean.
So I'm always purifying.
Because the day you catch a bread.
Is the day that you be dying, lying.
To the paths of light I go to church.

Spoken word.
And hoping for more to learn.
But the competition lets me downsoft.
Like a broken bird.
They say what Tina's heard.
So I close my eyes and I see two thirds.
That's just my philosophy.
Unbreakable mind frame with no apostrophes.
Splices, priceless.
Slices of the splices.
Through any sort of crisis.
Solve it like devices.
Getting stuck in vices.
Vicegrip, leave you dead like non-concise advise would.
I'm so precise.
Shit.

What differentiates you between you and.
That's the thing, that I do it all you know what I'm saying.
I make you laugh, cry, dance, stay home chill, headphones on you know.
I put you in that vibe.
I got something for everybody.
Everybody.
