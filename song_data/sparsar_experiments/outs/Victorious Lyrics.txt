Victorious Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


It seems the competition is riding on her tail.
It seems that they were hoping she, hoping she would fail.
The town has come to raise our guns to the sun.
But she will prove herself worthy.
She will be the one.

She will be victorious.
And won't get the battle loss.
Always-a mysterious.
Cause she will be victorious.

It seems that they are plotting out, plotting out destruction.
With the things that they have made around their own construction.
And can't you see that we are all the masters of our destiny?
And she won't be called the victim of your faded memory.

She will be victorious.
And won't get the battle loss.
Always-a mysterious.
Cause she will be victorious.

Don't you ever get tired and feel like giving up?
Don't you ever feel like, like you've had enough?
Don't you ever get tired of wondering what's wrong or right?
Don't you ever get tired and feel like giving up?

It seems that I just thought they could take their sweet time.
Sippin' cocktails in the sun, enjoying the sunshine.
She can't wait to unleash, unleash all her rage.
With an electric guitar and blow them off the stage.

She will be victorious.
And won't get the battle loss.
Always-a mysterious.
Cause she will be victorious.

Cause she will be victorious.
