Black Ocean Lyrics
by XOV.


Sha-la-la-la-la.
Sha-la-la-la-la.

Running, you're always running.
Looking for something you don't know.
Haunted, you're feeling haunted.
By the past and all of its ghosts.

Refrain.
I can see the sharks in the flood, sha-la-la-la-la.
They're out for your blood, sha-la-la-la-la.
Eat or be eaten, you wonder.
In a sea of monsters.

When your head's under water, dark water.
Black ocean.
When your head's under water, dark water.
Black ocean.

Sha-la-la-la-la.
Sha-la-la-la-la.

Emotions, so much emotion.
You don't know what to do with yourself.
An ocean, you've cried an ocean.
And you're too proud to ask for some help.

Refrain.
I can see the sharks in the flood, sha-la-la-la-la.
They're out for your blood, sha-la-la-la-la.
Eat or be eaten, you wonder.
In a sea of monsters.

When your head's under water, dark water.
Black ocean.
When your head's under water, dark water.
Black ocean.

Sha-la-la-la-la.
Sha-la-la-la-la.

You wanna know the motto?
Fuck the haters, fuck the lotto.
Sky-rocket, like Apollo.
Don't drown in that sorrow.

Refrain.
I can see the sharks in the flood, sha-la-la-la-la.
They're out for your blood, sha-la-la-la-la.
Eat or be eaten, you wonder.
In a sea of monsters.

When your head's under water, dark water.
Black ocean.
When your head's under water, dark water.
Black ocean.

Sha-la-la-la-la.
Sha-la-la-la-la.
Sha-la-la-la-la.
Black ocean.
