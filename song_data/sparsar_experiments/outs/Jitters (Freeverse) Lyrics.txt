Jitters (Freeverse) Lyrics
by Unda Preshur.

Drinking liquour that my liver can't pass.
Watch me wither and crash covered in cigarette ash.
With a Mickey mixing whiskey through the tip of the flask.
Pick up the glass couple hickies groupie chick in the back.

Find a bic I would I flash, nicotine attack.
Shiver and gasp, now I feel the swig of the jack.
Sit and relax on the couch lights flicker to black.
Drinking for a few days hear her whisper and laugh.

Was I dreaming of my ex? I got demons in my head.
I remember why I'm drinking cause I'm leaving to forget.
My regrets... Inner me screaming cause I'm dead.
Need a reason for me breathing cause this evening I was left.

Twas appealing it was sex, she was wet.
Vividly remember that the feeling was the best.
Consider her a friend before she reeled me in her web.
And I'm caught, got the heart, she's been stealing in my chest.

I wake up for a minute clutching into the couch.
I get this image of them living him and her in a house.
Exchange vows... now I say wow.
She said the same things to me I can break down.

She found the right man... I'm like damn.
Take another sip slam the bottle on my night stand.
Now she's a wife and a mother type we might ran.
Away young and dumb thinking that we had our life planned.

You won... No fair share of the win.
Going through a tough time and I'm scared that I'm in.
A dark world hard to breathe the very air that we live.
Im a different person don't you dare compare me to him.

Back to the couch, Feel I'm in a rough patch.
I'm a tough lad, empty bottles empty cups half.
Used to drink stuff like I love that and bump rap.
Now it's to stop these f*** ing thoughts I'm like god damn.

Razor blade romance between alocohol and her.
Calming all my nerves, tylenol and words.
Feel I'm falling off the earth ima Molotov I'll burst.
The walls around me burn. I'm concerned.
And I should call it off I'm hurt.

Heh, yeah look at me a f*** ing sucker.
Nicotine and coffee mixed with alcohol erupt the rubber.
Motherf*** er, and I gotta duck for cover.
She's got a kid with him I doubt I'll ever love another.
I'll f*** ing suffer.

Rapping on the couch a prisoner of booze.
Living in a room on a bed of cigarettes no sympathy I lose.
I feel your pity when I message him like is it true?
You heard about me said it'd be different If it was you.

I miss you calling me, right before we fall asleep.
Your boyfriend never knew it I was willing to give all of me.
Again, wonder if you thought of me when he proposed he oughta be.
A lucky f*** ing guy, you f*** ing rotted me.

When you said yes, now I feel head less.
My first real date winter time with a red dress.
I need some bed rest, not a stupid f*** ing couch.
With a bottle for a pillow man I can't forget this.

He knows you've been cheating when I came true.
He forgives you and me, and I did the same move.
I felt bad in that nervous house I'm in.
I never should of left just so you can work it out with him.

Thought we had more time, see you at the bar.
Before it close I wanted you one more time.
The thing with one more time, you think you're fine.
It's addiction I never would of quit it with you.
If I had you like you're mine.

Busy pacing the room, I'm on the couch again.
I can talk it out but I feel like saying f*** a friend.
F*** a friend, on a track I'll f*** ing jump again.
Talking to you, until the musics f*** ing done with then.
