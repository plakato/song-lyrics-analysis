Meditationz Lyrics
by 4 Broz By Broz.

Dj Oatmeal 
I'm ziplocked, with my get
fresh flow on 
My prose explodes just like an Edgar Allan poem 
I'm, a grizzled vet, a twelve-year pro 
But, I'm not above a little quid pro quo. 
I got the savoir faire in my dance and my walk. 
I got the funky ass beats and all you do is gawk 
Lil 2k10's gon na wield some clout, 
So Jim, get on the mic and turn it out. 
 
Lil 2k10 
I'll break your fucking bone use a piece stem cell, a clone 
And use that motherfucker to smash your fucking dome. 
I may be mad, but I ain't bad I'll CT scan you up with rad 
Engineer you, a new skeleton made of ice and chrome 
, 
DJ Oatmeal 
Just dropping in, and I see the track's gellin' 
Got a long wooden staff. Just like Ian McKellen 
Well, I'm the Lady's Choice like Hugh Jackman 
Just, try and beat my bro at Ms. Pacman 
Like Spock to Kirk \- or
Nash to Dirk 
You want to sound like this. Well, this shit takes work. 
The Grundle Bundle is in full effect, 
Now. My bro takes the mic so give him some respect: 
 
Lil 2k10 
Listen closely. Now
