Do You Want Me Lyrics
by Vivid.

You have seen it all before in your life.
Don't make it easier but you tried.
There's things that want to go wrong.
And I wonder.
Feel you're not the only one whos alone.
Sinking just like a stone.
But it's hard to know where to go.
And I wonder.
Wait for me today.
Love let me sway.
Make me the smile upon your face.
I believe you never wanted my love.
I believe you never wanted my love.
I believe you never wanted.
Do you want it?
We and all the things we learned to accept.
You know, it's easier to forget.
Fighting though it's so cold.
And I wonder.
You will see a lot of things in your life.
Can make it easier if you try.
Some things just have to go wrong.
Don't you wonder.
Wait for me today.
Love let me sway.
Make me the smile upon your face.
I believe you never wanted my love.
I believe you never wanted my love.
I believe you never wanted.
Do you want me.
