No Remorse Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

No one's gonna cry.
The war is here and now.
Brake down.

Defeated!
Pieces of my heart.
It's bitter!
N' there is no revenge.

The world is taken.
And I'm not gonna cry.

We kill before we die.
We kill before we die.
Brake down.

No remorse, no remorse.
What's done is done.
It could be worst.

Come on baby, don't mean maybe.
I will show you the way.

Long live the bastards.
The master of wolves....
