French Toast Lyrics
by Yung Kwon.

UH! Da one and only YUNG KWON!

Making french toast for my breakquick.
But it ain't shit.
Without my nesquick.
Yung Kwon reppin' the 856.
Get Lil B to cook it.
So I can get me some licks.
We on the food network.
Get you some tix.

Just made some ziti.
Got Ms. Logan asking.
Can you please feed me?
No, you bulimic bitch.

I spit supa hot fire.
Like a burning tire.
Or maybe just spittin' this.
Is getting me that much higher.
Maybe just a little.
And maybe after this.
You'll be harder than John Green's nipples.

Fuck Librarians.
