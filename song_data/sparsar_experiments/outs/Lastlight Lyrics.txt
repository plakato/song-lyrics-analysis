Lastlight Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

Forget your fears, and want no more.
Forget your fears, and want no more.

At first light lay proud foundations.
Sense the greatness that before you unfolds.
Seek no more for hollow answers.
Answers that lay within you all along.
Farewell to dawns seen through saddened eyes.
Farewell to pasts, to sorrows chained.
Forget your fears and want no more.
You will be strong and want no more.
You'll be adored, you will have everything.
You will be strong and want no more.
Forget your fears, you will have everything.
And want no more.
