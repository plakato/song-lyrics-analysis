Broken Box Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


I've got wine &amp; so do you.
Mine came with a cork.
I wish yours did too.
Everyone just loves you so.
Well hurray!
Now you know where to go.

In my head you're all brand new.
I guess you're really all the same.
In my head you're all brand new.
Tell your new boy where I came.
In my head you're all brand new.
I just didn't want what you gave.
In my head you're all brand new.
Go and find yourself another slave.

There you are.
Ooohh you're so in love, just like Juliette.
Well guess what?
That's one thing that you can for-fucking-get.
Tears from the sky.
In pools of pain.
Well baby tonight, I'm gonna go and dance in the rain.

In my head you're all brand new.
I guess you're really all the same.
In my head you're all brand new.
Tell your new boy where I came.
In my head you're all brand new.
Take that broken pussy elsewhere.
In my head you're all brand new.
Save it baby, I don't care.
