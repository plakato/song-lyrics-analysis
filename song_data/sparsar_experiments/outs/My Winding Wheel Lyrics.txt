My Winding Wheel Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Produced By Ethan Johns.

Well nighttime let her through.
Yeah I'm talking to you.
I wanna see her.
Precious little thing.
With eyes that dance around.
Without their clothes.

So buy a pretty dress.
Wear it out tonight.
For anyone you think could outdo me.
Or better still be my winding wheel.

Cause I feel just like a map.
Without a single place.
To go of interest.
And I'm further North than South.
If I could shut my mouth.
She'd probably like this.

So buy a pretty dress.
And wear it out tonight.
For all the boys you think could outdo me.
Or better still be my winding wheel.
Be my winding wheel.

Well the children laugh.
And sing a song that ushers.
In her driving rain.
And I'm standing in the station.
Like some old record.
Waiting on a train.

So buy a pretty dress.
Wear it out tonight.
For anyone you think could outdo me.
Or better still be my winding wheel.
Be my winding wheel.
