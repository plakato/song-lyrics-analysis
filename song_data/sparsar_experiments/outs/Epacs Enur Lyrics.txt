Epacs Enur Lyrics

Uh come over here, girl feel my Addy scimmy 
I'll top you off with whipped cream and add some jimmies 
The Wilderness is where you could kill me. 
Until Jagex changed the rules on us, unwillingly 
Yeah. I know that you're feeling me 
With a level sixty in wizardry 
Pestering pedestrians 
Always want to get wrecked for free 
But. It takes the best in me 
Not to beat these pussies
