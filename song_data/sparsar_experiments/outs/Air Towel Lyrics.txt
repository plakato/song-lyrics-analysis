Air Towel Lyrics
by Underworld.

Should I want it? Should I want?
Should I want it? Should I want?
Should I want it? Should I want?
Should I want it? Should I want?
Bunny girl, happy shopper, bouncing ball.
Telephone dial, shifting sun are you waiting for a bus?
Effort, effort, women sleep, who knows what happened to be my wish.
The shop was open now, how 'bout selling some more things.
Bouncing ball.
Bunny girl, happy shopper, bouncing ball.
Telephone dial, setting sun, are you waiting for the bus?
Human pleasure, trust that girl, human wire unverified.
Human glad, I remember, I come woman, I come women.
I come one man, I come one man, I come one man.
I come one man, I come one man, I come one man.
Bunny girl, happy shopper, bouncing ball.
Telephone dial, shifting sun, you are waiting for a bus.
Bedford sun, in the end, human pleasure, transmit love.
Human wire, I'm the same, I am glad thing and I come wandering.
I come wandering.
Jane is waiting in your software, in your blouse, in your denim.
Carrying her new software, little black thing is electric.
In the braid, in the braid, in gray, all she says now and he says.
Come on, fuck this, I'm no woman, I'm a maniac, I'm on trade.
I'm no paying, senseless geezer, where the doors are opening.
With electric unverified, in the tube hole, it is sliding full of moisture.
Getting on now, with his both hands, on the red poles, on the red poles.

Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
Should I want? Should I want it?
