Forget About us Lyrics
by Xander Ghost.


Forget about us us us x 3.
Did you run out of fucks this time?
Did you run out of luck this time?
Cuz i make movements that numb your brain.

Guess why i'm hated, im the motherfuckin man?
Guess why i'm hated, im the motherfuckin man!

I promised you i would always change.
You promised me you would never change.

I promised you i would always change.
You promised me you would never change up like seasons.

You a queen like latifah.
She slept through the whole night.
She slept through my whole life.

Ceilings falling, can't see us crawling out.
Ceilings falling, can't see us crawling out.

Let me test you. Remember me? If not.

Forget about us us us x 3.
Did you run out of fucks this time?
Did you run out of luck this time?
Cuz i make movements that numb your brain.

Guess what. i made us x 2.

I promised you i w stay out of lane.
You promise me you will stay in lane x 2.

You promised me you would never change up like seasons.

You a queen like latifah.
She slept through the whole night.
She slept through my whole life.

Ceilings falling, can't see us crawling out.
Ceilings falling, can't see us crawling out.

Let me test you. Remember me? If not.

Forget about us us us x 3.
Did you run out of fucks this time?
Did you run out of luck this time?
Cuz i make movements that numb your brain.
