Group Transport Hall Lyrics
by Women.

Grey balloons.
Set towards the sun.
Fighting words.
Underneath your tongue.
Soon we will be laughing.
Out there on the landing.
Now its too bright.
Dancing through the ash.
You made other plans.
Suicide.
To pick up on the few.
In the dark theres a narrow flame.
Soon we will be laughing.
Out there on the landing.
Now its too bright.
Dancing through the ash.
You made other plans.
