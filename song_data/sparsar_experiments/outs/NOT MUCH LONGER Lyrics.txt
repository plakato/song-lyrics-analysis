NOT MUCH LONGER Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.

Starin.
Shattered glass around me.
Not carin.
For shit.
Just the man i came here to hit.
Blunt-edge weapon.
Blunt-head steppin.
Woodland camoflauge.
I ain't stressin.
Got the special dressin.
Smith &amp; wesson.
Teflon.
Fuck it i'm shirtless.
My girls they skirtless.
Screamin.
Charlie sheenin.
Jacuzzi bubbles steamin.
Bitches beggin for my semen.
Snap back stop dreamin.
Only one on my team and.
Someone's gonna start bleedin.
If i can't gone and get my scheme in.
Ski mask gin flask.
Reach in my coat no time to ask.
Think fast muzzle flash.
Yall can bask in it.
Pissin on the crime scene.
Casket.
Run ya ass kid.
Fast kid.
Blowin a gasket.
Fuckin pass it.

Ain't livin long like this.
Layin in mud smellin like piss.

Will you help me miss?

The car won't start.
Just the fucking time.
No dine &amp; wine.
I scored the money fine.
Whip out the blade reload the nine.
Here comes four or five.
Walkin in rear view.
Don't they know who they comin through?
Buck one, buck two.
Get out the car door.
Three more, guts galore.
Time to even the fuckin score.
Fuck their newports man im blazin.
John way-zin, head high i'm hazin.
Stars can't catch me boy i'm fazin.
Running in circles man help me i'm crazin.
Livin outdoors fuck stayin in and prayin.
Blood stainin but its rainin.
I'm brainin so no complainin.
Com-pren-dane it?
