Cigarettes
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Speed of spit a little slower.
That's the spot below the fulcrum.
Where the wrist will prop me up.
Pounds of rocks inside the pockets.
Silverware stuck in the sockets.
Light me up and make a firebomb.

Cigarettes, and boys and movies.
No longer mean nothin' to me.
When did we get so old?

Cuts both ways across.
So sell it back at cost.
And wonder your mother would she cry.
If she knew what you gave, gave, gave up?

Shuck and jive right in the face of everyone who's got a case of.
Something that could hurt you too.
Disrepair and demolition.
Start at home inside the crawlspace.
Where they learned to be that way.

Cuts both ways across.
So sell it back at cost.
And wonder your mother would she cry.
If she knew what you gave, gave, gave up?

Now I can feel the life slip.
Now I can feel the life slip.
Out of me.
With repetition.

Cigarettes, boys, and movies.
No longer mean nothin' to me.
Tell me when we got so old.
