Don't Make Me Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Do I have to fight anyone, anyone?
I said don't lie, keep it real.
I said don't try, what you're waiting for?
Don't make me pull up on your main hoes x2.
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money.
Money, money, money, moneyx2.
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money.

Ain't nothing new a nigga been finessing.
You out your mind, you think a nigga's stressing.
I'm eating good, might get the dinner special.
Cause that's so motherfucker disrespect.
North side, that's my city nigga.
Don't make me hit the club with 50 niggas.
Don't make me leave the club with 50 bitches.
I let them talk you while I'm really livin'.

Do I have to fight anyone, anyone?
I said don't lie, keep it real.
Don't try, what you're waiting for?
Don't make me pull up on your main hoes x2.
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money.
Money, money, money, money x2.
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money.

I know what your girl wants.
She doin' and kickin' it like the World Cup.
I promise it ain't nothin' sweet here nigga.
And shout out to my real streets niggas.
I think I'm the man, I know I'm the shit.
And if I come thru, I'm bringing the drinks.
Foreign on our lips.
My shirt in my jeans, it goes with the kicks.
I'm makin' it five.
And blowin' it six.

Do I Have to fight anyone, anyone?
I said don't lie, keep it real.
Don't try, What you're waiting for?
Don't make me pull up on your main hoes x2.
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money.
Money, money, money, money x4.
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding tha money.
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding tha money.
