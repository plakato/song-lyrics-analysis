Chicken Fries (Featuring Mike Lopes
by Tyler Luke.


Yo we made this thirty minutes ago. 
 
5'5, not intimidating 
6'2, I'm in the making 
 
Still one two checking it 
Mirrors aren't reflecting it. 
Girls keep rejecting it. 
All these prospective rifs 
I'm, not correcting it 
Rather connecting it 

In the times you keep intersecting it 
You're objecting it 
Objecting. My words objecting my sounds 
Objecting, my nouns 
But, you better start respecting it 
Before. I start selecting 
The indirect objects and injecting it 
With. Some kerosene 
Kerosene in the blood stream 
Then, maybe I'll, be as gassed up as you'll, be 
That's a little pun, 
A little pun, for you mind, 
Just having a little fun 
Lil dapper by my side, 
Covalent Connories got you bonded to me: 
Simply 
A, metaphysical rotation,
