I'm So Depressed - Bonus Track Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

I was born during the hard depression days, my lord.
I was born during the hard depression days.

In July, in South Georgia, the suns hot as a blaze.
We had nothing.
We had nothing.
At the end of the day.

Looking back over my life.
Oh lord, I'm so depressed.
Oh lord, I need some rest.

Tell me how long must I wander.
Tell me how long must I cry.
I need someone to wipe.
The tears from my eyes.
Come on, baby.
Rub my head.
Rub my head while I lay in my bed.
Kiss me baby, 'till I feel alright.
'Till I feel alright.
'Till I feel alright.

Looking back over my life.
Oh lord, I'm so depressed.
