Better In Boots Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Yeah, you know I love you in a tight dress.
But you're, oh my God, slippin' out of it.
You turn me on, girl you know you do.
But you tear me up even better in boots.

We ain't gotta worry ‘bout gettin' dirty.
We can do whatever we want.
Baby put your Luccheses on.
You know you want to.
‘Cause we got a full moon.
And it's Friday night.

Ain't nothin' ever looked better in boots.

Fair, girl it ain't even fair.
When all it takes is you lettin' down your hair.
To drive me wild like you know you do.
It works every time but even better in boots.

We ain't gotta worry ‘bout gettin' dirty.
We can do whatever we want.
Baby put your Luccheses on.
You know you want to.
‘Cause we got a full moon.
And it's Friday night.

Ain't nothin' ever looked better in boots.

We ain't gotta worry ‘bout gettin' dirty.
We can do whatever we want.
Baby put them Luccheses on.
You know you want to.
‘Cause we got a full moon.
And it's Friday night.

Ain't nothin' ever looked better in boots.

Ain't nothin' ever looked better in them boots.
