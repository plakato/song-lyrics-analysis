HEAR ME NOW Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Aye-ay-ay.
Left field, call it.
Babe Ruth, ball it.
Your boyfriend's got a cauliflower dick and I'm an alcoholic.
So sue me.
Who you, Judge Judy?
Stacking the rubies, if life was a.
movie, then you could just call me The Goonies.
You're not relevant, trolling on the Internet.
No respect.
Haven't moved out of your parents' basement yet.
Big Nat, come on with the beat that's going to break your neck.

Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
If you like it loud, we can make it loud.
Can you hold it down? Cause we can hold it down.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.

Refrain - Instrumental.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.

Turn it up, turn it up to eleven.
Blow this bitch, blow this bitch straight to heaven.
Drop the big beat, so they gotta listen.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.

We're just a couple of weirdos.
Coming to your city sending bass into your earlobes.
Like your bleached out hairdos.
We glowing in the dark, got the spark, 'bout to flare the fuse.
That's just how we do.
Geronimo, parachute, skydiving off your parents' roof, 100 proof.
Saw the magician's assistant in half.
like who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are we?
We be the dudes who just come over to water the lawn.
We don't say hi, we just come over to walk your dog.
We nice like that, we super nice like that.

Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
If you like it loud, we can make it loud.
Can you hold it down? Cause we can hold it down.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.

Refrain - Instrumental.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.

Turn it up, turn it up to eleven.
Blow this bitch, blow this bitch straight to heaven.
Drop the big beat, so they gotta listen.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.
Yeah, you can hear me now.

Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
If you like it loud, we can make it loud.
Can you hold it down? Cause we can hold it down.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.

Refrain - Instrumental.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.

Turn it up, turn it up to eleven.
Blow this bitch, blow this bitch straight to heaven.

Drop the big beat, so they gotta listen.
Aye-ay-ay.
Yeah, you can hear me now.
Yeah, you can hear me now.
