Ain't No Man Lyrics
by SWV.


Oooh babe, ain't nothing like.
Waking up everyday to your face.
Never wanna let go, never wanna say no.
It's crazy, in deeper than love.
It's hard to even try to explain.
So all my ladies who know.
What I'm talking bout say oh.

Oh, it's like you come alive when you hear the voice.
No, your heart doesn't have a choice.
Oh, and I've had my share of boys.
If you know like I know.

There ain't nothing like a man.
No, no little boys for me.
I don't do rookies, get with me.
You've gotta own the team.
Ain't no man like the one I've got.
Ain't no man like the one I've got.
Ain't nothing like a man.
Yep, he know he got a Queen.
Now ladies if you've got a King say it with me now.
Ain't no man like the one I've got.
Ain't no man like the one I've got.

And the truth is, there's women all across the world.
Getting tired... Please.
Never wanna let go, never wanna say no.
I don't miss the drama and the sleepless nights.
Wasting all of my tears, wasting all my tears.
So all my ladies who know.
What I'm talking bout say oh.

Oh, it's like you come alive.
When you hear the voice.
No, your heart doesn't have a  choice.
Oh, and I've had my share of boys.
If you know, like I know.

Ain't nothing like a man.
No, no little boys for me.
I don't do rookies, get with me.
You've gotta own the team.
Ain't no man like the one I've got.
Ain't no man like the one I've got.
Ain't nothing like a man.
Yep, he know he got a Queen.
Now ladies if you've got a King , say it with me now.
Ain't no man like  the one I've got.
Ain't no man like the one I've got.

Ain't no man.
Ain't no man.
Do me like you do.
Treat me like you boo.

There ain't nothing like my man.
No, no little boys for me.
I don't do rookies get with me.
You've gotta own the team.
Ain't no man like  the one I've got.
Ain't no man like the one I've got.

Now ladies if you've got  a King say it with me now.
