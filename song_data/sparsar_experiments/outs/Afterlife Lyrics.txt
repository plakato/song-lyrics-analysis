Afterlife Lyrics
by Switchfoot.


I've tasted fire I'm ready to come alive.
I can't just shut it up and fake that I'm alright.
I'm ready now.
I'm not waiting for the afterlife.

Let it burn the way the sunlight burns my skin.
The way I feel inside, the way the day begins.
I'm ready now.
I'm not waiting for the other side.
I'm ready now.
I'm ready now.

Everyday.
The world is made.
A chance to change.
But I feel the same.

And I wonder why.
Would I wait till I die.
To come alive?
I'm ready now.
I'm not waiting for the afterlife.

I still believe we could live forever.
You and I we begin forever now.
Forever now.
Forever.
I still believe in us together.
You and I we're here together now.
Forever now.
Forever now.
Or never now.

Everyday.
A choice is made.
Everyday.
I choose my fate.

And I wonder why.
Would I wait till I die.
To come alive?
To come alive?

Everyday.
Everyday.
Everyday.
I still feel the same.

And I wonder why.
Would I wait till I die.
To come alive?
To come alive?

I'm ready now.
I'm not waiting for the afterlife.

I'm ready now.
I'm ready now.
I'm ready now.
I'm ready now.

I'm ready now.
I'm not waiting for the afterlife.
