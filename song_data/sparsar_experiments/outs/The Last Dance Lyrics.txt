The Last Dance Lyrics
by Voice.

I remember.
The dew of the meadow.
And the unspoken words.
Between us.

I remember.
The fascinating sunset.
And your frienldy smile.
Full of trust.

But now.
When I need you like never before.
What now.
When my soul cries No more.
No more walking hand in hand.
No more the same fun with our friends.
Nothing's as it used to be.
Only the past surrounds me.

Dreams are like a rainbow.
A rainbow through good and bad times.
Kepp them forever.
In your heart, in your soul and in your mind.

We believe that.
With the power of our love.
We could go through heaven and hell.

But the eternity of a merciless fate.
Made our hearts fall.

But now.
When I need you like never before.
What now.
When my soul cries No more.
No more walking hand in hand.
No more the same fun with our friends.
All that remains is the remembrance.
To our last dance.

Dreams are like a rainbow.
A rainbow through good and bad times.
Kepp them forever.
In your heart, in your soul and in your mind.

Dreams are like a rainbow.
A rainbow through good and bad times.
Kepp them forever.
In your heart, in your soul and in your mind.

Dreams are like a rainbow.
A rainbow through good and bad times.
Kepp them forever.
In your heart, in your soul and in your mind.

Dreams are like a rainbow.
A rainbow through good and bad times.
Kepp them forever.
In your heart, in your soul and in your mind.
