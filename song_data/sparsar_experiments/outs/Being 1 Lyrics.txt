Being 1 Lyrics
by Volbeat.

One word took the other, and suddenly.
We're stronger than we ever could imagine.
A bond that can cut through the fire of hell.
Sharing one mind one heart forever.

I've been holding you for a year or two.
You're the reason why I'm holding up.
And our love's gonna last forever.
We'll be dancing the streets again in Memphis.
I hate every sec, every minute you're gone.

For so long we been talking and sharing the dirt.
Been laughing at the fools who couldn't hear us.
Getting stronger together and falling in love.
And nothing in the world can separate us.

I've been holding you for a year or two.
You're the reason why I'm holding up.
And our love's gonna last forever.
We'll be dancing the streets again in Memphis.
I hate every sec, every minute you're gone.

I've been holding you for a year or two.
You're the reason why I'm holding up.
And our love's gonna last forever.
We'll be dancing the streets again in Memphis.
I hate every sec, every minute you're gone.
