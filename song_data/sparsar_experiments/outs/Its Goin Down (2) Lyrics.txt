Its Goin Down (2) Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

I knew I was being threatened. 
Do you think it's worth holding out' 
I mean I've heard some pretty ugly things about those guys 
Ugly stories, 
Watch them flee, watch them flee, 
Rap up, 
Watch them flee 
Hip-Hop hits 
And you do it like this 
It's going down. 
The rhythm projects'round, the next sound 
Reflects, the complex hybrid dialect, now 
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down: 
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style, 
The combination of a vocal caress, 
With lungs that gasp for breath. 
From emotional stress 
With special effects: 
And a distorted collage 
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage, 
 
It's, going down 
The logical progression on a the time line. 
The separation narrowed down to a fine line. 
To blur the edges, so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible, odyssey, 
Now, it's going down, 
 
Put, put put it up. 
I said it goes like this 
And you do it like this 
It's going down 
Once again, it is 
Composed sentences, all together, venomous, 
The four elements of natural force, 
Projected daily through the sound of the source 
Everybody on board. With this blend 
The sword with the pen, 
The mightiest is the weapons 
Swinging right from the chin. 
The elevate of mental states 
Long gone with the wind 
To defend men for shoddy imitation, pretends 
It's going down. 
Stalence emulation readily 
Trekking through the weaponry 
Of the pure pedigree 
Cleverly, seeing through whatever is ahead of me. 
Whatever, the weather be 
We, invent the steadily 
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high 
I rhyme regiment. That'S calling the shots. 
Execution of collaborative plots 
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop 
It's going down 
The logical progression on a the time line. 
The separation narrowed down to a fine line, 
To blur the edges, so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible, odyssey, 
Now. It'S going down, 
 
X-men'bout to blast of world wide 
Yo. It'S request. Only *scratches* 
X-men'bout to blast of world wide 
It's built from scratch. 
Album in stores soon 
'Bout to blast off world wide 
And. You do it like this 
It's going down. 
 
Like this
