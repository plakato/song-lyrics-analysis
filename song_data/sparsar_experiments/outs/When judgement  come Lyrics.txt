When judgement  come Lyrics
by PureMatics.


The devil is raising an army
He is at war with everyone, but himself
Fights everyone
And never takes the blame
Quick to point a finger
True champion of wishy washy
Says, a lot of educated assumptions
That amount to nothing
Nothing, but hate
Nothing, but fate
Can free him of his guilt
He is in deep
In too deep.To turn Back now
He owes the devil. His soul

Living in Hell
The devil, is already
Living among us
In different disguises
From corporate
To street corruption

Jah. Save my people
Jah. Save your people
Jah ain't. We, the same people

Umuntu ngumuntu
Ngabantu
People are people
Nake zakho
Hlwukana lezam
Life is the master
And. We all
Just mere students
Let's all get high on music

Let me tell you: How
I denied the devil. My soul
The carbon dated
Lost cause
Has found a new cause

With. Its tenacity
It causes great disrupt
Of, course
When judgement. Come
I shall be your Angel
Your soldiers, Angel
Hell or heaven

I shall see your soul
To rest
So. You can forever
Rest in peace
I, am the earthquake
That brings stability
To the planes and planks
I decompose your body
In time tested ways
Not even embalming
Can saves your corpse

Cops and strippers
Robbers and dealers
Priest Po po Popes
I have no boundaries

When judgement. Come
I will be your Angel
Your soldiers Angel

High on music
Turns drama thriller

If. There is one thing
I'm Good, at
Is rotting, your body before
I, take your calcium

At this stage of decomposition
The pathologists
Can. Only imagine the decay

I feed you to the worms
I. Take my time
Cos! U sure ain't going
Nowhere

I, suddenly appear
In many forms
As. I collect more lost souls
High on music goes
Thriller drama, slash, action
The, hip-hop delivery
Is, suddenly taken over
By, a narration

Improving maturation
Slicing air with tooth picks
Only. Those deprived
Of freedom
Actually Know what it is
The natural order
Is, always protected

The natural order
Is, always protected

When judgement. Come
I will be your Angel
Your soldiers Angel

High on music
Turns drama. Thriller
When judgement come
