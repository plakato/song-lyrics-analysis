The Exit Lyrics
by Sydney.

We have the chance and we've got to make this right.
I think the thought in your mind is to have a good time.
You're never quick to second guess, everything comes out so blind.
You've got a knife in your hand but it's a gun fight.

Can you feel it?
Cause you're talking way too loud.
Can you feel it?
As the people crowd around.
You won't find an exit now.
So don't hold it back right now.
You won't find an exit now.

So now I'm out on the streets.
And you know that they've got nothing on me.
So don't sleep with both eyes closed.
Don't sleep with both eyes closed.
So now I'm out on the streets.
And you know that they've got nothing on me.
So don't sleep with both eyes closed.
Don't sleep with both eyes closed.

A second glance and you know that she's not right.
Besides, it's always your friends who have your back tight.
When she whispers in your ear that she cares for you, she lies.
It's just the same old shit and you're just a new guy.

Can you feel it?
Cause you're talking way too loud.
Can you feel it?
As the people crowd around.
You won't find an exit now.
So don't hold it back right now.
You won't find an exit now.

So now I'm out on the streets.
And you know that they've got nothing on me.
So don't sleep with both eyes closed.
Don't sleep with both eyes closed.
So now I'm out on the streets.
And you know that they've got nothing on me.
So don't sleep with both eyes closed.
Don't sleep with both eyes closed.

And oh we are, so quick to point fingers, with fragile hearts.
We stick to convictions, when from the start our sight was restricted.
Come on now, just let go.
We both know it's no one's fault.

So now I'm out on the streets.
And you know that they've got nothing on me.
So don't sleep with both eyes closed.
Don't sleep with both eyes closed.
So now I'm out on the streets.
And you know that they've got nothing on me.
So don't sleep with both eyes closed.
Don't sleep with both eyes closed.

You won't find an exit now.
So don't hold it back right now.
