Can't Believe Lyrics
by Virtue.

You knew my destiny.
Before I was concieved.
Brought out the best in me.
And Lord I wanna thank you.
A diamond in the rough.
You looked beyond my stuff.
And saw potential that.
Nobody else could ever see.

People let me down.
Player Haters all around.
So tell me how you like me now.
I survived my wilderness.
I still can't believe.
That you chose me.

I can't believe you chose me.
I can't believe you loved me.
Even though im not worthy.
I can't believe you saw me.
I can't believe you chose me.
Lord im thankful that you chose me.

So many years I felt.
I just can't help myself.
And used excuses just like.
Moses at the burning bush.
Go set my people free.
Thats what you said to me.
And as you go just like the.
Lepers I'll deliever thee.

People let me down.
Player Haters all around.
So tell me how you like me now.
I survived my wilderness.
I still can't believe.
That you chose me.

I can't believe you chose me.
I can't believe you loved me.
Even though im not worthy.
I can't believe you saw me.
I can't believe you chose me.
Lord im thankful that you chose me.

RAP.

People let me down.
Player Haters all around.
So tell me how you like me now.
I survived my wilderness.
I still can't believe.
That you chose me.

I can't believe you chose me.
I can't believe you loved me.
Even though im not worthy.
I can't believe you saw me.
I can't believe you chose me.
Lord im thankful that you chose me.
