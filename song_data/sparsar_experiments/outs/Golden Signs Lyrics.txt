Golden Signs Lyrics
by Voice.

See our traces through the times.
With fire and the Ten Commandments.
Let us follow the golden signs.
Till we reach the end of this world.

The sun is burning from the sky.
Heat distorts illusions of the waterline.
Salty flavor, a companion through our dreams.
For the search to the land of the golden sins.

The waves pound against the bow.
You feel a boney hand on your throat.
Water as far as your eyes can see.
Please God, show us the land of the free.

See our traces through the times.
With fire and the Ten Commandments.
Let us follow the golden signs.
Till we reach the end of this world.

See our traces through the times.
With fire and the Ten Commandments.
Let us follow the golden signs.
Till we reach the end of this world.

We are the divine deliverers.
Far away from home.
We bring sickness, death, destruction.
In the name of god.
The mercyful god and the crown.

In the shadows of these holy lies.
Demand salvation, a treacherous price.
Under this command.
We lay your fate in devil's hand.

See our traces through the times.
With fire and the Ten Commandments.
Let us follow the golden signs.
Till we reach the end of this world.

See our traces through the times.
With fire and the Ten Commandments.
Let us follow the golden signs.
Till we reach the end of this world.

See our traces, traces through the times.
With fire and the Ten Commandments.
Let's follow the golden signs.

See our traces, traces through the times.
With fire and the Ten Commandments.
Let's follow the golden signs.
Till the end of the world.
