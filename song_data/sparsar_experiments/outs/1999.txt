It'S TwentyOne 
And umm, I'm bout to be 21 
If that counts, 
Only, Classics forever, 
Uh 
What, you need Bet. I got it or could get it 
I'm a pilot navigating through this game to get up in it. 
Who you tricking with that nonsense. 
That! Oh I'm! The bomb shit 
That - oh I'm, the one I just the LeBron of rap. 
Nigga. I doubt it 
With those basic ass lines that you talking 
Them repetitive flows, like your mind, has no content. 
Almost every one of y'all is ass, like Eeyore in the first place, 
Speak as if you grinding, but you tweet more than you work, 
Face facts. 
I just call it like. I see it, 
I see it as a wonder. Other people never seen it. 
You have no type of vision. 
Better luck to see at night, 
Niggas spitting like they just learned how to read and write 
Nigga. You nice, you, nice 
You, not you not 
Regardless of your hype, who the fuck gave you the mic. 
Who, the fuck told you to rhyme 
Who, the fuck told you to write. 
Whoever told you to spit whole opinion. Wasn'T right, 
You, say: Aziz, ain't, nice! Well, you prolly be correct. 
Only got one shot like the ref called a tech 
So. You can't live life being Mr. Nice Guy 
Tryna. Take my spot. 
I could tell em nice try. 
Twentyone is on my mind. 
Yeah 
TwentyOne is, on my mind, 
 
CUTS TO 12-YEAR-OLD AZIZ. 
 
My name is Flow, and I know how to rhyme 
You out of line. If your rhymes try to compare to mine
