Heartbreak Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

It'S time to jam, 
 
Take-take-take it-take, it 
Hot 
 
So! Won'T you come inside, 
 
Take it. While it's hot 
Take it. While it's hot 
Give it all you've got 
Take it. While it's hot 
, 
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, 
, 
I've, always dreamed. This was the way that it could be 
Just like a fantasy you're here alone with me 
So now it seems, we've slipped into reality. 
And, it's plain to see. This is our destiny. 
 
Feelings I try to hold just seem to take control. 
I lay awake, my body shakes with just one thought of you: 
The door is open wide, so won't you come inside 
And. Do those special things that lovers do 
 
Take it while it's hot whoa, whoa 
I, think the time is right, 
Take it. While it's hot 
I, want your love tonight, 
 
Give, it all you've got whoa whoa 
Don't. Let this feeling end 
Take it. While it's hot 
Cause, it may not come again: 
 
Come-come-come inside 
Come, again 
Come-come-come-come inside 
Can't-can't-can't, wait 
 
Sometimes, I'm shy, but now I think that you should know 
The deeper, that we go the more my feelings show 
Time passes just like birthdays come and go. 
So light the candles, babe and I'll make a wish and blow 
 
I like the way you groove and wan na make us move 
It's time to live. I wan na give you what you're waiting for 
The lights are pink and low. I think we're good to go 
We're wasting time and I can't wait. No more 
 
Take it while it's hot whoa, whoa 
I, think the time is right. 
Take it. While it's hot 
I, want your love tonight, 
 
Give, it all you've got whoa whoa 
Don't. Let this feeling end 
Take it. While it's hot 
Cause, it may not come again: 
 
Come inside-come-come-come inside 
Come, again 
Come inside-come-come-come 
Can't-can't-can't wait: 
 
Hot-hot-hot-hot, 
Hot-hot-hot-hot, 
, 
Take-take-take it-take, it 
Take-take-take it-take, it 
Take-take-take it-take, it 
 
Take it while it's hot whoa, whoa 
I. Think the time is right, 
Take it while it's hot 
Cause. I want your love tonight, 
 
Give, it all you've got whoa whoa 
Don't. Let this feeling end 
Take it. While it's hot 
Cause, it may not come again: 
 
Take it while it's hot whoa, whoa 
I! Think the time is right, 
Take it while it's hot 
Cause. I want your love tonight, 
 
Give, it all you've got whoa whoa 
Don't. Let this feeling end 
Take it. While it's hot 
Cause, it may not come again: 
 
Take it-take it 
Take it-take it 
Give it-give. It 
Take it while it's hot 
, 
Come again 
I think the time is right, 
Take it while it's hot 
Cause. I want your love tonight, 
 
Give, it all you've got whoa whoa 
Don't. Let this feeling end 
Take it. While it's hot 
Cause, it may not come again: 
 
Take it while it's hot
