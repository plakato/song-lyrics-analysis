Pressure Lyrics
by Two-9.


Okay, the jig is up 
Time to apply the pressure. 
Ring ring tell'em to bring the stretcher 
It's money in the dresser 
All. My guns got suppressors 
, 
I'm hearin', a lot of talk, 
But, a nigga, won't say shit to me. 
I done came up on a whole lotta cash 
 Got ta, spend it til. It'S 
And this bitch next to me, 
So, damn paranoid 
While, I'm sittin' back countin' this 
Crash 
 
Okay. The jig is up 
Time to apply the pressure. 
Ring ring tell'em to bring the stretcher 
Okay. The jig is up 
Time to apply the pressure. 
Ring ring tell'em to bring the stretcher 
 
Bare face robbers 
Runnin', oh, we saw them 
We, don't show no love for that. Black and white 
Charge'em 
Fake niggas make me sick. 
How they still livin' if they sell a remix 
3 6, where I come from 
Eastside east coast. They'On'T want none 
From, my Two-9 niggas since day, one 
I'mma bang that shit'til my day come 
Gravedigger, say what you say: nigga 
Bring, that drama where you lay nigga 
Grown man can't play wit' ya' 
Better, listen what I say to ya' 
If you play wit' the 4 5 then it get so live.

Okay. The jig is up 
Time to apply the pressure 
Ring ring tell'em to bring the stretcher 
Okay. The jig is up 
Time to apply the pressure. 
Ring ring tell'em to bring the stretcher 
It's money in the dresser
