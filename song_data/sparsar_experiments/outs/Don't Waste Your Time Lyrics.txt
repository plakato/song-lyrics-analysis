Don't Waste Your Time Lyrics
by SWV.

Don'T waste your time, 
You should be mine. 
Come get to know my love, my love 
Don't, look, no more 
You can be sure 
Come get to know my love 
 
Baby. Can you tell me 
What it takes 
To, get to know your love 
I want you love me in every way, 
I got what you're waiting for 
Don't waste your time, no 
 
Don't waste your time. 
You should be mine. 
Come get to know my love, my love 
Don't, look, no more 
You can be sure 
Come get to know. My love, 
 
Here in my arms is where you should be: 
No need to be alone. 
I can fulfill your fantasy 
Give, your real lovin' to me, 
 
If time is what you need. 
 
, -Please- 
 
Don't waste. Your time. 
You should be mine. 
Come get to know my love, my love 
Don't, look, no more 
You can be sure. 
Come get to know my love
