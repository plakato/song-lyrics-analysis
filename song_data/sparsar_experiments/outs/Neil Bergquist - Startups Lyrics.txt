Neil Bergquist - Startups Lyrics
by Yumas.

Neil Bergquist.

Now, this is a story all about how.
My life got flipped-turned upside down.
And I'd like to take a minute.
Just sit right there.
I'll tell you how I built a tech startup in Seattle.

In Western Washington born and raised.
Fighting to stay awake in class most of my days.
Codin and dreamin of my next move.
Taking about life when I finally get cool.
When a couple of guys who were up to some good.
Started raising money in the neighborhood.
I wrote a few lines of code and my mom just scoffed.
She said ‘your gonna intern with your father over at Microsoft”.

I begged and pleaded with her day after day.
But she packed my brief case and sent me on my way.
She gave me a kiss and an ORCA pass.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well relax'.

First day, yo this isn't fun.
Stack ranking and commuting to Red-muhnd.
Is this what the corporations are living like?
Hmmmmmmm this won't be alright.

PARt 2.

But wait I hear there's money, if you got ideas.
Can we talk to some investors over a couple of beers?
Now I'm funded, money in the hundreds.
Keepin the burn rate low, with mom's sack lunches.

PAUSE.

Well, my round closed and I hired some buddies.
A couple google ads and Bezos is flashing money.
I ain't trying to get bought out yet I just got here.
I sprang to a basement like lightening n' disappeared.

I made a demo and built a pitch deck.
Some more investors said “great” and wrote me a check.
My mentor got tickets to CES in Vegas.
I said “We're ready, yo homes, release the beta!”.

PAUSE.

I. pulled. up to the trade show bout 6 or 7.
And I yelled to my customers “yo homes, come and get it!”.
I looked at my kingdom.
I was finally thurr.
To sit on my throne as an entrepreneur.
