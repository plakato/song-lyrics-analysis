Obvious Lyrics
by Awa.

There's no reason or explanation.

But your eyes are somehow out of place.
Get a grip on the situation.
It's the same words upon your tongue.
But they seem to come out wrong...
There's a cold wind, blowin', we've got no resistance.
You hold me, closely, but there's still a distance.
With every little word we speak, with every little touch I see.
That everything that's all you need, are fragments of what used to be...
It's so oh-oh-obvious, it's so oh-oh-obvious, it's so oh-oh-obvious. We should.
end it before it hurts....
I'm not sayin' it wasn't worth while, it was all I ever wanted.
You were all I ever wanted.
I'm not saying we weren't in love, but the more we got involved the more we.
seemed to dissolve.
There's a cold wind, blowin', we've got no resistance.
You hold me, closely, but there's still a distance.
With every little word we speak, with every little touch I see.
That everything that's all you need, are fragments of what used to be...
It's so oh-oh-obvious, it's so oh-oh-obvious, it's oh-oh-obvious. We should.
end it before it hurts....
We should end before it hurts.. x2.
There's a cold wind, blowin', we've got no resistance.
You hold me, closely, but there's still a distance!
With every little word we speak, with every little touch I see.
That everything that's all you need, are fragments of what used to be...
It's so oh-oh-obvious, it's so oh-oh-obvious, it's so oh-oh-obvious.
We should end it before it hurts....
With every little word we speak, with every little touch I see.
That everything that's all you need, are fragments of what used to be...
It's so oh-oh-Obvious, it's so oh-oh-obvious, it's so oh-oh-obvious. We should.
end it before it hurts... x2.
We should end it before it hurts... x2.
