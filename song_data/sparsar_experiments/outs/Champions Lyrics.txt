Champions Lyrics
by Wordplay.


Oh captain my captain, got hits like Eric Clapton.
Your career gon fall like Jenga and I'm immune cause of my passion.
Harassin' the masses, with the music from the baddest.
Rapper in the game, Word Play got magic.
I'm focused on this music, like I took some addy.
Everybody follow my ways, y'all my caddies.
I be chillin' with my niggas smoking packs like fannies.
And my gurl, so bad, so smart, so dandy.
Randy, Mossin' these people tryna defend me.
Quit hating on a brotha and you know you wanna be like me.
I got hella avenues to get rich.
Sad thing is soon I gotta pick.
PhD, gold medals, Grammies, Understand me?
No sleep, I need to take some Ambien.
As long as my words motivate and change someone.
Then I'll be a champion, word.

Yeah we play to win, ?
Imma keep giving my all but we never giving in cause we some.
Champions, champions, champions, champions.

Champions! Champions! Somebody call the ambulance.
Bodied beat, call that shit, face to hands.
I ain't gon lie and say I got a hundred bands.
But if I did I'd probably buy some Hammer pants.
No, some gold pants and make my own dance.
My arms strong, call me Lance, I do this shit, for my fans.
Fuck I need some fans though, my bars are gifts, Christmas bow.
Where my foe? I'm wonderful, got stars for days.
Galileo looking up till I make my Milky Way.
I'm like Ali in his hay, Frazier, Goliath.
Gotta fall someday, Tampa Bay, Green Bay.
I want my own fucking bay, no my own holiday.
Or my own land, I'm the damn magistrate.
What up Word Play everyday a workday.
9 to 5 in the booth switching lanes in the coupe.
Gold on the tooth, bullet lyrics when I shoot.
Duck and cover when I come through, Ike Jr. what it do!
