Joy And Pain Lyrics
by Wordsworth.

Sample.
Joy and pain.

Joy.
A whole lotta.
Pain.
You know I feel ya.
Pain.
A whole lotta.
Pain.
But you can't have.
Joy.
Without a whole lotta.
Pain.
You know I feel ya.
Pain.
A whole lotta.
Pain.

As a lyricist, ain't no one that's equivalent.
I'm the answer, no question to anyone that you quiz on it.
Bars make you envision imprisonment.
Made colorful like a rainbow.
Like when light retracts from the angle the prism's bent.
Win by the largest margin, beating any artist charting.
For all you starving artists.
I got a bargain charging.
We've been sold out every market brought in.
I'm glad that you here Madison Square to Boston Garden.
It's been hard when parking.
Excelling revenue.
I spell illegible.
There's no mistakes, done in one take once I read it through.
I'm incredible.
Been placed on a pedestal.
Unmeasurable, so high I got a better view than Heaven do.
Let's go mono e mono.
Not to follow is my motto.
Like nozzle's with hollow tips making hits for Serrato.
With a model mullatto that flew in from Colorado.
With bottles of beer and better hair than Troy Palamalu.

Joy and pain co-exist, I'm one of Jehovah's gifts.
A vocalist for the consumers commuters and motorists.
There's rumors I'm rolling with.

Using computers showing foes that I'm posing in photo's with.
Lames know we not in the same boat it ain't close.
You kidding.
You shouldn't be living on the same coast.
On a plane to Spain and my brain boasts.
Thoughts on the tracks slicker.
That react quicker than Usain Bolt.
This is the pain reliever.
Your speakers bleed, blood.
will drain your tweeters.
You the pre-show I'm in the main arena.
And many come to see us.
Acknowledge us and read us.
More followers that Tweet us, have now become a leader.
Cause everyone believes, the city's under siege.
I'm hotter than a hundred sun degrees even when summer leaves.
Who can we not astound?
Me and Apollo Brown a sure bet.
Open up your wallets throw some dollars down.
