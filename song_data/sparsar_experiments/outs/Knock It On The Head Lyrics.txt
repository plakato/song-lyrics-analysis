Knock It On The Head Lyrics
by Wood.

Gonna give myself a talking to.
I don't think I'm getting through.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
Gonna ask myself for one last try.
Give myself a reason why.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
You can be sure, I'm trying my best.
But I could stay in every night and still fail the test.
I won't let on say everything's fine.
The walls are closing in but I do not mind.
I'm gonna give myself a talking to.
I don't think I'm getting through.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
I'm gonna ask myself for one last try.
Give myself a reason why.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
Make the phone ring, bring me good news.
I live in deep freeze but I thawed out for you.
God only knows what I'm gonna do now.
I could get on but I don't know how.
I'm gonna give myself a talking to.
I don't think I'm getting through.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
I'm gonna ask myself for one last try.
Give myself a reason why.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
Can I sleep slipping back?
And every day that passes ah, I want back.
I want back now, now.
Make the phone ring, bring me good news.
I live in deep freeze but I thawed out for you.
God only knows what I'm gonna do now.
I could get on but I don't know how.
Gonna give myself a talking to.
I don't think I'm getting through.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
After that I'll knock it on the head.
Gonna get somewhere.
Gonna get somewhere.
Gonna get somewhere.
