Interlude Lyrics
by Yung Berg.

Yung Berg, 
Yeah 
You, know always been a starter. Yung'Un don't do beach. 
Home grind derby, I'm headed for the feets 
But. Instead of niggas standin up and cheer. For me, 
 Wan na see my momma cry. Homies pour beer for me, 
I mean once again I'm a product. What you made me 
Solid as a Roc, I couldn't sign with Jay-Z, 
See, first Infrared and then Bloodline, 
Now, I'm a young boss and shorty. It'S grill time, 
Back tatted for my niggas cause. I love mine 
And. Now this real talk is no punchline 
Yeah and I ain't speakin, no riddles 
My bro had squares with stamps. In the middle 
He used to take trips, they would pack up the rental. 
Pop was at the crib still workin on a demo 
Yung livin reckless blowin on chronic 
Momma sent me off to school said her son was demonic, 
Secluded from the world. I couldn't see trees 
But. It gave me time to grow a little time to do me. 
Writin raps in my head, no beat 
Fucked up bed, one pillow no sheet 
And. My pops wrote a letter in about a month. It reads: 
Your time's, comin, soon, you'll be out. In a week, 
I moved out to Cali, with my big sister Eve. 
She had faith in a yung'un. She just told me: BELIEVE~, 
Believe, {, *echoes*, }
