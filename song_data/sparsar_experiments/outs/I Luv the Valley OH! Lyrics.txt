I Luv the Valley OH! Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.


It's a pill and you've got to take it.
It's a pill that you've got to take.
It's a pill and you've got to take it.
I won't rest until you take it.
That's a heart that you made.
That's a heart and the both of you made it.
That's a heart that you made.
I won't rest until I break it.
It's l'histoire de la famille.
It's l'histoire de la fam.
It's l'histoire de la famille.

And I won't rest until I forget about it.
I won't rest until I don't care.
I won't rest until I forget about it.
I won't rest until I don't care.
La la la la la la la.

That's a razor and you make a threat.
That's a razor, make a million billion threats.
That's a razor and you make a threat.
And I won't rest cuz I heard it all before.
My behind is a beehive.
There's a buzz in my backside.
My behind is a beehive.
And I won't rest while you break my will.
Je t'aime the valley.
Je t'aime the valley OH!!!
Je t'aime the valley.
I am an orphan de la vall√©e.
