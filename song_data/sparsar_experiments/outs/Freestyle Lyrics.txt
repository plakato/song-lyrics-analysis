Freestyle Lyrics
by Queen of Hearts.


Stop make your moves for me, 
Stop keeping me behind bars, 
I get the feeling I keep breaking through the mould 
Come clean 
Cause. When I feel your body close 
I can't seem to breathe 
 
So. Let me freestyle 
Freestyle, baby 
 
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee, 
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee 
 
Love, not a part of me, 
Your love how it 
I can't deny. I love you when you're playing tricks with my mind 
Over and over 
Let it breathe or let it burn. 
I just can't decide. 
 
Stop make your moves for me, 
Stop keeping me behind bars, 
 
I can't hold on to the night 
All I dream out in the day, 
I can't hold on to the night 
All I dream out. In the day, 
Free me 
Free, me
