Caretaker Lyrics
by XP.


Yeah....

Okay.....

Now what makes you think that your so much better?
How dare you leave your smell on my sweater?
How dare you hit me in the night.
With a smile trying to Skype.
Like we're still friends.
When your the whole reason that it did end.
When it did had to cry a little.
Had to ask why a little.
Had to wish that I died a little.
Love is a war.
But ain't nothing civil.
All the shit I would've paid for.
For us to not have blown out the candle.
If I show up to your house late night for some sugar.
Could I still get a handful?
Momma always told me be careful.
But I didn't listen.
Played without a full deck.
Now I'm going fishing.
I guess you're too old to be babysitting.

Cause I have been bad.
Oh but you know I still gotchu baby.
I've been bad.
I had to do what I had to do.
But you know I still love you.
Sorry.
Still I'll take care of you.

Even if you've got a man now.
I'd be forced to understand, now.
