White Lyrics
by X.E.X.


La la la.
La la la la.

I'm hungry.
So bring your body.
Cause I'm empty.
So feed me plenty of you.

Sin was your perfume.
But you smelt like an angel too.
I choked on your pretty fumes.
Chewed on you from noon till the moon.

And your flavor stole my tongues time.
Had I known your heart would bite.
I'm the victim to your night crime.
Now my brain sees the red light.

I'm hungry.
So bring your body.
Cause I'm empty.
So feed me plenty of you.

Your body was your weapon.
And you made it my addiction.
Your beauty was the poison.
Your beauty was my poison.

Me an angel in a bad mess.
You a devil in a red dress.
I'm your prey but baby stop these games.
Your my drug now , so kill my pain.

I'm hungry.
So bring your body.
Cause I'm empty.
So feed me plenty of you.
