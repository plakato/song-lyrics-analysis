Lay Down And Just Write Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.


Stephen Hawking couldn't comprehend the depth 
Of. What lies inside my mind and I design with every breath 
Shakespeare couldn't hold a pen like me, 
One, like breaks illiterates obliterates. His syche 
Let me reiterate: inseminate your wifey 
Slayed tracks from styles from laid back to hyphy 
Yes. I'Ve made stacks no Maybachs or icey 
Pricey Rollies. No, he couldn't care slightly 
What you aspire to. I retire to nightly 
I recognize that and I don't take it lightly. 
I just set my sights at a higher height B 
Could. It be that you're. Just so much flyer, yo 
Might be 
Never, been hired, never been fired, 
Never been tired, 
desired or secretly admired 
I play. A social spectator here collect data 
Crunch digits into lyrics that I store to catch wreck later 
Dismantle, your philosophy in a split second 
Could, give a damn about what an upper class twit reckon 
I'll. Have you reborn in a mere moment, 
It's, clear, you're, no opponent for the Arizonan Ronin 
Getting caught up in my zone leads to serotonin depletion 
Known to leave a legion pleading at the feet of the Phoenician 
As you're leaching off the genius trying to feed off my Secretion 
My rhyme feats are prime meet you small potatas, 
Still yelling. We the greatest give a fuck. If y'all debate us 
Call as haters, we just acknowledge. What'S factual, 
These other dudes rap, I make tracks that impact. You all 
Every bar calculated styles, amalgamated 
Compiled algorithms in files that I created 
Drove miles, sedated on an unpaved road 
In, an unbuilt city, but I still paid tolls 
The, God laid scrolls for mere mortals to learn from 
As. I lean back with a green quarter and burn some 
The rap black quarterback white emcee, rapping 
On any night sure to sack your first string. Captains 
I'm the worst thing to happen to rap since major labels 
The same ones. That made you the rage and staged your fables 
You, never paid dues. All you did was pay your way 
So when I'm rocking open, mics you'll be rocking pay-to-play 
Quit talking who cares? Who says who rocks it? Hard? 
Your arms are too short to trade blows with Docks the God 
Sure you can rhyme fine, but next mine, your flows, sub-par 
You cats are Primetimes.
