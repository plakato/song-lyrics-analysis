Action This Day Lyrics
by Queen.


Action.
This street honey is a mean street.
Living in this street honey needs a mean.
Streak.

We've got criminals living in this street.
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on.
Pumping.
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record.
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring.
I gotta feeling, this world is using me.
This town honey is a dead town.
Living in this town honey is a showdown.
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keep in.
Pumping.

Some sunshine ray through a crack in a.
Shutter.
Or a sight of a light at.
The end of a tunnel.
Still there's a feeling, this world is using me.

Action this day.
Action this night.
We've got to learn to learn to live to love.
You can't say it ain't right.

Action this day.
Action this night.
You've got the power, you've got the power.
You've got the power to love and to live.
You can't say it ain't right.

Your mind honey is a bleak place.
Living in your mind's living in a bleak place.
Your mind is coming from a rat race.
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on.
Pumping.
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record.
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring.
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this.
World is using me.

Action.
Action this day.
