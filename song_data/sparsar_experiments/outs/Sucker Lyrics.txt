Sucker Lyrics
by Queen Kwong.


Honey if you fall.
Don't expect me to save you.
You should know me better than that.

Funny how after all.
I shot the swan outta the song we never wrote.
Just cause I needed a good laugh.

You've heard it all before.
I'm the kind of girl who keeps one foot outside the door.
Did you really think I'd change?
Nothing like a good thing going the wrong way.

I never loved you.
The way I wanted to.
I never loved you.

They say it's a fact.
I made you from a rib outta my chest.
And when you break I'll take the blame.

Maybe that's that.
I'm too lazy to try to get you back baby.
You're gone and I'm still the same.

You've heard it all before.
You've heard it all before.
