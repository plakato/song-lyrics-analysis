Too Much Lyrics
by Que.


My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me.
I could give two fucks.
Bout to pour me up some Easter pink.
I need two cups.
Roll up dope, say I smoke too much.
Hold up, ho you don't smoke enough.
Fall back ho you can't go with us.
Yeah you bad, but ho so what?
Too much, stackin' up dough, I got too much.
Too much, fuckin' up ho, do too much.
Too much, stuntin' on life, do too much.
Too much, they say a young nigga do too much.

They say a young nigga do way too much.
Roll dope, get high, and don't say too much.
Stackin' up dough they say I made too much.
Got a get money gut, like I ate too much.
I'm gone, roll one up and get blown.
Both of my bitches, they know what's really goin' on.
I guess that's why they both pissed at me.
They call theyselves tryna play tricks on me.
One bitch tryna post pics of me.
Man, the other one say I act differently.
Well, I can give two fucks.
All I need is two cups.
To go along with two sluts.
I don't really want too much.

My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me.
I could give two fucks.
Bout to pour me up some Easter pink.
I need two cups.
Roll up dope, say I smoke too much.
Hold up, ho you don't smoke enough.
Fall back ho you can't go with us.
Yeah you bad, but ho so what?
Too much, stackin' up dough, I got too much.
Too much, fuckin' up ho, do too much.
Too much, stuntin' on life, do too much.
Too much, they say a young nigga do too much.

Took a bitch out the first night it took her two months.
Pockets lookin' fatter than a tumor.
Ruth Chris, blue dolphin, you bitches be eatin' school lunch.
These G star jeans? They too much.
Shoes with the wings they too much.
My Versace frames they too much.
Any damn thing I do too much.
I be bumpin' so much, I be drinkin' so muchh.
That don't mean shit, I still smack a bitch if I'm sober.
I just met the bitch but I'll crash the bitch like I knew her.
I don't wet the club, unless they pay us to show up.

My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me.
I could give two fucks.
Bout to pour me up some Easter pink.
I need two cups.
Roll up dope, say I smoke too much.
Hold up, ho you don't smoke enough.
Fall back ho you can't go with us.
Yeah you bad, but ho so what?
Too much, stackin' up dough, I got too much.
Too much, fuckin' up ho, do too much.
Too much, stuntin' on life, do too much.
Too much, they say a young nigga do too much.

Probably bout havin' a threesome, they say I do it too much.
It's probably gonna be another hit.
Fuckin' up a nigga bitch, doin' too much.
And I don't even drink lean, but a nigga sippin' two cups.
Cause she just got 'em done, and her booty next.
Is she doin' too much?
I came in with a thug, gave a stripper love.
Then I threw too much.
Say that she can hang, her and her girls.
Then the bitch threw up.
Man, I miss the A too much.
When I come I always stay too much.
All the girls that I love say I play too much.
Life full of sin, can never pray too much.

My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me.
I could give two fucks.
Bout to pour me up some Easter pink.
I need two cups.
Roll up dope, say I smoke too much.
Hold up, ho you don't smoke enough.
Fall back ho you can't go with us.
Yeah you bad, but ho so what?
Too much, stackin' up dough, I got too much.
Too much, fuckin' up ho, do too much.
Too much, stuntin' on life, do too much.
Too much, they say a young nigga do too much.
