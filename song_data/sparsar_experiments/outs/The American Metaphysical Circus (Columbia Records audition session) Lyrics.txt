The American Metaphysical Circus (Columbia Records audition session) Lyrics
by United States of America.

At precisely 8-0-5 
Doctor, Frederick von Meyer 
Will attempt his famous dive 
Through a solid sheet of luminescent fire 
 
In. The center of the ring 
They are torturing a bear 
And, although he cannot sing 
They, can make him whistle Londonerry Air 
 
And. The price is right. 
The cost of one admission is your mind: 
 
We shall shortly institute 
A syncopation of fear, 
While, it's painful. It will suit 
Many customers whose appetites are queer. 
 
Or for those who wish to pay 
There are children. You can bleed 
In a most peculiar way. 
We can give you all the instruments. You'Ll need 
 
And. The price is right. 
The cost of one admission is your mind. 
 
If, you're harder yet to serve 
We, have most delightful dreams. 
Our recorders will preserve 
The intensity and passion of your screams, 
 
For. We only aim to please 
It's our customers who gain 
As their appetites increase 
They must come to us for pleasure and for pain, 
 
And. The price is right. 
The cost of one admission is your mind
