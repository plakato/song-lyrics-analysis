Thunder Man Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.

Aw shit.
Here we go again, here they go again.
Talkin' shit about a real man, let me ask you this:.
How many of you little niggas got your own shit.
Bitch, me and all my niggas got our own damn crib.
Bitch, me and all my folk record our own damn shit.
In-house studio, flexed out for your bitch.
When she walk through the door all she do is compliment.
Bitch i'm finna smoke a blunt so i don't wanna say shit.
Don't bother me i'll break your ass if you take my tip.
Here's a tip: if you stuck get the fuck up out of here.
I ain't playin' with no stupid nigga, i aim anywhere.
Lock and load on his fuckin' soul, turn that bitch cold.
Let it shatter like the ice do when it hits the floor.
Bitch i'm trynna see wassup my.
whole squad on the boat.
Bitch, say the wrong shit we make your stupid ass float.
I ain't never been a bitch, ask all my old hoes.
Nigga ask yours too, hah, he ain't even know.
Yuh yuh, she came through and dropped her panties on my floor.
Yuh yuh, she licked me up RIGHT before she LEFT with you.
Yuh yuh, this is preaching and i don't give no fuck fool.
I let these hoes do what the fuck they want to.
Cause these hoes gon' do what the fuck they want to.
East memphis where i'm at, don't matter where i move.
Tell a ho stay home cause the cash comin through.
Niggas ask me where my lyrics at, who the fuck is you.
Bitch, fuck that rapping shit i'm only here to tell the truth.
And these niggas don't listen til i say it in the booth.
All these rappers lookin spooked, bitch why you scared fool.
Is it cause i'm off the chain i dominate my whole lane.
Play with me i'll throw a bomb and destroy your whole game.
Tundra boy, thunder man, just a few of my names.
Bitch i claim a new one everytime i climb the rank.
You bitch.
