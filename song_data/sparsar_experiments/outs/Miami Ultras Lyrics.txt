Miami Ultras Lyrics
by Yung Lean.

Refrain 
I'm not looking for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not looking for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you. 
 
Pop pop pop drop, this top top top 
I roll, like a rock rock n roll to the top 
I dont give a motherfuck watchin' starwars smokin' pot 
I. Take what I got. I live till. It stops 
Chop chop chop. All my lungs stay rot 
I! Take what I got you hate that you're not 
Like me and me. I don't give a motherfuck 
What. I am what I'm not polo down to my socks, 
 
What person. They can't stop. I fly to the top 
F-f-fuck what you got. I'M off
a pill rollin' like a rock 
White diamonds, countin' guap. I got marble on my watch. 
I got slam doors out the front I'll keep goin' till I'm out. 
I got pockets like the plug, I'm movin''round all day, 
Fade to grey everythin' can't stay 
I smoke. So much went away. 
I'M in leanworld, l-l-let my
mind stay 
Whichever. Today I love my brothers. We gon' slay 
 
Refrain 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you. 
 
I miss some places. I wish we lived on another earth. 
You think you hate me. I know that it hurts 
Burn burn burn. My turn turn turn 
Burn burn burn. My turn turn turn 
I miss some places. I wish we lived on another earth. 
You think I hate you. I know that it hurts 
I burned burned burned. My turn turn turns 
Take. A way and yearn, yearn, yearn 
 
Refrain 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not looking for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you. 
 
Pop pop pop drop, this top top top 
I roll, like a rock rock n roll to the top 
I dont give a motherfuck watchin' starwars smokin' pot 
I. Take what I got. I live till. It stops 
Chop chop chop. All my lungs stay rot 
I! Take what I got you hate that you're not 
Like me and me. I don't give a motherfuck 
What. I am what I'm not polo down to my socks. 
 
Refrain 
I'm not looking for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not looking for you 
I'm, not for you 
I'm, not for you
