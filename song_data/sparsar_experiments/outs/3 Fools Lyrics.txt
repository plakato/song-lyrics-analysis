3 Fools Lyrics
by Swift.

Simply when you watch me.
I can't see another soul.

Strolling away.
Some things may never change.
Like the way I see you.

A brilliant mind controls you.

Strolling away.
Some things may never change.
Like the way I see you.

And ever so often.
When my feet stop enough to let my eyes see.
I realize this is forever and we're forever.

Strolling away.

Strolling away.
Some things may never change.
Like the way I see you.
