Plain Buildings Lyrics
by Zu.

Jump out that cold water.
300 strong sparta.
They saying Meet Goliath.
Well I got strong orders.
I spit fire like I never heard of hell's borders.
Inhale this piff like you tryn make your lungs older.
Best believe the boy cold, bipolar.
And if you're coming against the kid.
Get your clothes in order.
Hey, I tell 'Dress accordingly.
I'm Mike Tyson, ripping ears up audibly.
Money of the mind I'm getting cheese unstoppably.
Ignorance ain't bliss nigger look at our economy.
Tears roll out of my soul to my anatomy.
When the lights turn on to a dying breed of human being.
Fake friends don't hang around till eternity.
And yeah nigga I'm preaching to the burden meek.
We're all terminal, there's no supremecy.
Apartheid was only ment for the hell and heavenlies.
Uh, Yeah nigga this lyrical.
I came to cut the game in pieces like a surgical procedure.
And breathe faith to non belivers.
Heal the sick of that verbal diarrhea.
