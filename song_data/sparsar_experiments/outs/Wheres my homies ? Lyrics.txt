Wheres my homies ? Lyrics
by Unholy Homies.

Reek the cleric .. heads get severed.

Backflip into a guatamalen sinkhole.
Just to get some privacy.
From all you fuckin sheeple.
The media they lie to me.
Shoot head shots thru peep holes.
Life is just an odyssey.
Although it has a sequel.
Ya soul will get repo'd.
Fuckin wit me yo.
Pop a red pill and bend my mind like I'm ne-yo.
Caribbean bitch she in my ear speaking creole.
I'm ashin on her couch and I'm tryna watch TiVo.
I ain't tryna have a c.o homie.
I wanna breathe Os.
Ain't a singer but a nigga tryna hit the c notes.
My unholy primos known to stick to the g code.
She threw me in her box cause I'm so gifted nike sb by guitar gibson.

The act look like lisa frank folder color.
Fucked a milf bitch than she hold a brother when my dad lost an eye swear it was.
The coldest summer.

I ain't busta but all my niggas flipmode.
And we finna do you greezy like crisco.
We the shit bro.
The shit simple x2.

The express just passed so it's no way we missed it 27 grams smoked a nug and.
I.
Zipped it we like 47 deep all chillin on smithin.
Had a couple hoes that catch nuts on chestnut a bitch named Alyssa she gave.
the.
Best fuck.
Roll the sess than I'm off to the shack to rest up.
Same shit everyday bong rips and heavy jays.
Phernegen cups mixed thoughts a homie dazed.
Till the day I awoke and peeped im in a maze.
Kicked in the White House doors like its a raid.
It's just a phase we gon prosper we don't fade.
Now my following hitting numbers in the K's.
We on plum island takin heavy totes of maryjane.
Swords under the leather trench coat like I'm blade.
To open you lil niggas mind I was ordained.
Weed be super sticky like a plasma grenade.

I ain't busta but all my niggas flipmode.
And we finna do you greezy like crisco.
We the shit bro.
The shit simple x2.
