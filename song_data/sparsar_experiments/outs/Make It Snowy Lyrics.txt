Make It Snowy Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


My nigga Mooxe.

You can find me in the right lane cruising.
In the dark range choosing.
In the whippo with prescripos and zippos moving.
With the right flow bro.
With my white girl blow.
With money leaves falling I'll say if it's gon snow.
I make it breeze.
You can't believe.
Chick from Paris.
And another from Belize.
Can't find that on a map.
Call me sir cause my rap wordplay is absurd.
They do anything to make me say cheese.
I say jeez.
Chilling drinking brown.
Spiz and Turbine twisting trees.
Way to please.
Cut that check like it was Siamese.
Make you speak in tongues like Guyanese.
For feasing lots of G's.
Just getting crazy.
Off that potion.
Can't decide like I'm Frank Ocean.
I'm hoping that she open.

Make It Snowy.

Let me kick this hot shit for ya.
People talk mad shit but I ignore it.
I jump in my whip and then I floor it.
I keep my eyes on what's important.
My vision's straight and not distorted.
Headed to the top with all my homies.
And I'm so quick you couldn't slow me.
Turbo on my right and you know he hold me down.
Thought my left he don't touch the ground.
I hit this weed then I'm solar bound.
Safe to say that I'm slower now.
Aw shit it's over now.
Cause I beasted you so get homeward bound.
I'm just a kid but it's going down.
Two oh three I love my town.
And you know that I'm about that bag.
And I'm about that rap.
And I just might snap.
And you can't bounce back.
And I'm posted up.
And I'm stoned as fuck.
When I'm on this shit it gets opened up.
And you know it's Young Spiz I'm dopin' up.
Triple T we dope as fuck.
Bring that shit to me.

Make it snowy, uh.
Uh, Make it snowy.
