Illusion Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel.
Hoping what you need is behind every door.
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change.
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all.
The feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else.
Feeling as though you never belong.
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy.
I truly understand. Please, don't cry now.

Please don't go, I want you to stay.
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here.
I don't want you to hate;.
For all the hurt that you feel.
The world is just illusion, trying to change you.

Being like you are.
Well this is something else, who would comprehend?
But some that do, lay claim.
Divine purpose blesses them.
That's not what I believe, and it doesn't matter anyway.
A part of your soul ties you to the next world.
Or maybe to the last, but I'm still not sure.
But what I do know, is to us the world is different.
As we are to the world but I guess you would know that.

Please don't go, I want you to stay.
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here.
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel.
The world is just illusion trying to change you.
Please don't go, I want you to stay.
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here.
I don't want you to change;.
For all the hurt that you feel.
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you.

Please don't go, I want you to stay.
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here.
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel.
The world is just illusion trying to change you.
Please don't go, I want you to stay.
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here.
I don't want you to change;.
For all the hurt that you feel.
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you.
