Kick the Habit Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

If I could light, light you up.
I think I'd smoke a pack a day.
If I could drip, drip you dry.
Think I'd drink, drink you straight.
I'd get my fix with every kiss from lips of novocain.
I can't quit, I gotta have it.
In so deep, I crave it bad.
It's all I want, to be your addict.
Girl you make it hard to kick the habit.
Shake, make me shake.
Put your kiss on my face.
Knock me down, spin me round.
You won't keep me on the ground.
Oh so pretty, makes me dizzy.
Too much ain't enough.
I can't quit, I gotta have it.
In so deep, I crave it bad.
It's all I want, to be your addict.
Girl you make it hard to kick the habit.
I gotta have you.
I gotta have you.
I gotta have you.
I'll be your personal junky.
The beating in your heart.
Just say you gotta have me.
Say you'll never stop.
I can't quit, I gotta have it.
In so deep, I crave it bad.
It's all I want, to be your addict.
Girl you make it hard to kick the habit.
I gotta have you.
I gotta have you.
I gotta have you.
