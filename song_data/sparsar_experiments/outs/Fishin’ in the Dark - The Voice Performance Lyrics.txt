Fishinâ€™ in the Dark - The Voice Performance Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Fishin' in the Dark  - The Swon Brothers.
Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight.
Shinin' through the trees.
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs.
Are floatin' on the breeze, baby get ready.
Across the field where the creek turns back.
By the old stump row.
I'm gonna take you to a special place.
That nobody knows baby get ready.
You and me go fishin' in the dark.
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars.
Where the cool grass grows.
Down by the river in the full moonlight.
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night.
Just movin' slow.
Stayin' the whole night through.
It feels so good to be with you.
Spring is almost over and the summer's come.
The And days are gettin' long.
Waited all winter for the time to be right.
Just to take you along, baby get ready.
And it don't matter if we sit forever.
And the fish don't bite.
Jump in the river and cool ourselves.
From the heat of the night, baby get ready.
You and me go fishin' in the dark.
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars.
Where the cool grass grows.
Down by the river in the full moonlight.
We'll be fallin in love in the middle of the night.
Just movin' slow.
Stayin' the whole night through.
It feels so good to be with you.
You and me go fishin' in the dark.
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars.
Where the cool grass grows, down by the river.
In the full moonlight we'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night.
Just movin' slow.
Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you.
You and me going fishing in the dark.
