Stay (Freestyle) Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.


I'm thinking about you.
Ain't going lie.
Tonight I prolly messed it up with you.
If you was man.
Tell me what would you do.
If that time came when a chick threw at you?
Would say no?
Or would you fuck that ho.
Man I wasn't ready.
But she.
Wanted to go.
For my actions.
I have to pay a toe.
But before you pack and go.
May I ask can you.

Just for one night.
To make things right.
To prevent a fight.
You just went and left right?
But If my name is Bruce.
London I would hold you tight and guide you through this Dark Knight.

Never letting you go far.
Out of my sight.
It's hard leave until you leave.
Yea that sounds right.
Friend or Foe.
No matter where you go?
I want you to know.
In my heart is where you . ..

Baby I want you know.
I hate to admit but tonight I was wrong.
I.
I guess that's the reason for me making this song.
Please don't cry or be mad.
Like I know I jeopardized what we had which is so sad.
But please.
Just please don't get mad.
I love you but my actions may not convey.
I'm sorry.
Through it all bay I just really want you to Stay.

Like Like.
Just please.
If I have to I would get down on my knees.
To beg for forgiveness.
Because life with you just seems so endless.
See . ., sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye.
I just want you to know I'm not like these other guys.
I promise no more lies.
You hear me Bay?
If you do today I really just want you to Stay.

From yours truly. -TwoineyLo.
