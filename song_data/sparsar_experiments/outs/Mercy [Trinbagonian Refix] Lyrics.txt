Mercy [Trinbagonian Refix] Lyrics
by Yung Rudd.


Ok, I'm ridin' round in that Nissan prepubescent... that's B14.
See a sexy shorty, pull up, ask, What's yo scene?
She said, I wanna know what your head feels like, I ain't talkin' bout yo.
bean.
Told her like movies that ain't filmed yet, Gyal, is no scene.
And we roll out, I'm smoked out.
Like Gwen Stefani, No Doubt.
That the head that you asked for is gonna be in your mouth.
Don't ask for no favours, of my way I ain't goin' out.
For air you gasp like arillo... yeah girl, when you goin south.
We reach, so first I take a puff of the herbs, dan.
Then hit that harder than a Federer serve can.
Then on your knees when I ready to burst and.
Don't let none get In Your Eyes... Erphaan.

Interlude: Sick.
Haha!

Too much vibes!
Woo! Woo! Woo!
Xplicit!
Yung Rudd, I tell yuh!
The thing MAD!
