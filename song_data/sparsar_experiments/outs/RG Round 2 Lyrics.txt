RG Round 2 Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

The rap merker's back.
I'm killing ghosts and facing lame cats.
I'll take your puppy dog and throw some jerky on the train tracks.
Think you're fly listen, I'll hawk a loogie at you hood spitters.
Remember your puppy? I threw its body through a wood chipper.
Flow's mean and bitter, delivery smoother than the UPS.
I got the Feds watching cuz I'm boxing up my new Ex.
Put me on a pedestal I'm standing over top of gents.
I'm feeling bad to butt-in but it's time to face the Consequence.
Peace to AD, Christ, the god's are looking down at me.
Notoriously nasty I'm hoping life is good after death.
Sticking my dick in your girl like I'm drilling for oil.
I'm sorry man I'm meddling in your bushes, your plans will be foiled.
See I'm the blue devil spitter and the game just committed to Duke.
If your too simple to get it, rap's going to shit.
As soon as I spit I wreck tracks someone call the task force.
That was just a test, dummy but you can't afford the crash course.
Lyrically you're.
A biter like a teething baby.
Buy sunglasses, foam at the mouth, now I have rabies.
Fuck trees! I hate Oaks sign to Interscope if I want it Shady.
I'm Universal Son, why'd you blew seamen like Navy?
I'm the fisherman; I'm dropping my lines nonstop.

I have STD's, but my worm's in your girl's snapper.
After I finish, I nickname her mouth the crabs trapper.
