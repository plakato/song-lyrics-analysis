Cops and Robbers Lyrics
by 415 fossas.

Tim and Eric.

Bang bang cops and robbers, bang bang robbers and cops. Bang bang rob that.
bank, put em in jail put em in jail.

Bang bang rob that bank. Put em in jail, put em in jail.

Keep em locked up with a million dollar bail.

Trade their black and white strips for jump suits.

Fuck the police. They all just corrupt racist brutes.

Sittin in a cop car, eatin donuts then leanin back to take a nap.

Or sittin in a dark room listenin to my phone that's on tap.

If a cop ever walks in and busts the stripper sittin on my lap.

I'mma pull out my young Glock and bust his ass with a cap.

Now, let's go back to prison with this rap.

Where you get cock in the hole where there should only be crap.

All dudes no sluts so you gotta learn to fap.

Dick gets raw. Gotta use some tree sap.

Chains tight around my wrists like I got em at the Baby GAP.

If you wanna stay outta jail, follow my directions like a map.

Steal, speed, lie, rape, and murder all you want.

But if your mom, sister, bitch, or some stripper see you do it you better.
fucking kill that cunt.

Hood rat shit, that hood rat shit.

Spit, I spat, till you hear that click clack.

Cops and robbers, I make em' spit.

Double take, they know I legit.

We locked up, she knocked up.

She aborts and I make her squirt.

I got the market covered with this niche.

Drug money making me nigga rich.

Cops questioning me, they buried in that ditch.

Throw them in, their throats slit.

I spit diarrhea, every line a mess.

After that abortion, my bitch depressed.

One thing is for sure, she can attest.

That when I shoved my dick so deep, cardiac arrest.

Final showdown, bank of fort knox.

Cut the tellers dick off, end up in cellblocks.

Smuggle a file in my ass, beat the cell locks.
