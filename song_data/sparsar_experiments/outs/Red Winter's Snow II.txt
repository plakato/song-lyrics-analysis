Red Winter's Snow II
by Voices Of Destiny.

There is no one left to mourn with me*.
No single bird to sing.
Signs of life disappeared.
Now there's wasteland all around.
Where once were fields of green.
Would you say we've always saved our face.
Spent our time in useful ways?
Signs of life disappeared.
Now there's wasteland all around.
Where once were fields of green.
We have burned paradise.
Clouds dust and smoke arise.
Make all the angels see:.
This is humanity.
We're always fighting for being superior.
We've lost this fight.
Lost our minds.
Signs of life disappeared.
Now there's wasteland all around.
Where once were fields of green.
The sun has melt away all the show.
See our monument lying in ruins.
All that remains is blood and stone.
Right beside the brain pours out of a head.
The king has lost his unlawful crown.
Crawled to the edge and fell to death.
