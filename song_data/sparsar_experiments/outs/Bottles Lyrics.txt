Bottles Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Everyone is in the gray.
And I don't care if anyone's two faced.
I'm sleeping.
Don't plan on checking in.

I try to greet troubles with apathy.
Hello's are never what they used to be.
I'm heaving.
Help me down the drain.
Do you even remember me?
I'm leaving.
You're way gone.

Constant reminder.
Sounds like you need help reminding.
Locked on, I'm dead on.
Sounds like you need help reminding.

All I know is made by human beings.
So I can't put my faith in anything.
I'm sleeping.
Don't plan on checking in.
But I wonder where the hell you've been.
I'm leaving.
Gone.

Constant reminder.
Sounds like you need help reminding.
I'm locked on, I'm dead on.
Sounds like you need reminding.

I'm used to breaking bottles when you ruin this.
It's what I do.
This isn't just goodbye.
This is me forgetting you.

Constant reminder.
Sounds like you need help reminding.
I'm locked on, I'm dead on.
Sounds like you need reminding.
