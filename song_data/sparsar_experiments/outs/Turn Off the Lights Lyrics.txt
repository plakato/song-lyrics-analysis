Turn Off the Lights Lyrics
by World Class Wreckin Cru.

Hey what's happening: baby 

Cuz, I'm the world class doctor 
The master of seduction. 
I can heal all your ills. 
And give you extreme delight 
But. Only if you allow me 
To turn off the lights. 
 
1 Before you turn off the lights. 
Let'S get one thing understood: 
If you plan to make love to me. 
You'Ve got to do it good 
Cuz, I'm a hell of a woman 
And. For me it takes a hell of man. 
So, don't you dare turn off the lights? 
Unless this. You understand, 
 
Yes. My name is Shakespeare: 
A, world class poet, 
So kick back and relax yourself. Baby 
Let me pour you a glass of Moet 
Darkness will be your blessing 
As. I bring you extreme delight 
But. First, you must allow me Shakespeare, 
To turn off the lights. ... click, 
 
2, Don't turn off the lights. 
Unless you'll love me right. 
You hear what I'm saying: 
Cuz boy, I'm not playing 
Don't turn off the light. 
Unless you plan on staying 
, 
And. Of course, I'm DJ Yella 
The mixologist of the crew 
And. I would just love 
To mix bodies with you 
Your lips. I would kiss 
Your body. I would hold tight 
But only if you allow me 
Check this out. 
To turn off the lights. 
 
Like, a meloncholy dancer for you, I'd dance, 
With, nothing, but a g-string. On my hip, 
Your kiss and touch I'd slowly collect 
For they'd, be my tip 
There's parts of your body, I'd slowly, kiss 
And, others I'd gently bite 
But. First, you must allow me Lonzo 
To turn off all the lights. 
 
Staying
