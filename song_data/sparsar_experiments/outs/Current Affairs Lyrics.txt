Current Affairs Lyrics
by Zion I.


Posted up on the block, kinda eyein' the spot.
Late night city life got me twitchin' a lot.
Kinda nervous, I'm sure that we under the watch.
Cameras touchin' every surface, soon the drama gon' drop.
Be it the cops, or just another government plot.
Got a brother under surveillance, the harder you rock.
The harder they clock, camouflage, I'm part of the flock.
Feelin' 'noid cause they never caught who shot 2Pac.

Well, this beats makin' 'em bear, and so I'm takin' it there.
Strip it to the core, ooh, primal fear.
Men keep it iron, no tears.
Don't know why your son came out a one-legged albino queer.
Something's in the water.
They wanna vaccinate my fate, ain't got enough dollars.
It's not a mystery, True Crimes, white collar.
In due time, what you find mind alters.

Current Affairs to thrill your mental.
They want you p'noid boy, it's simple.
We wide-eyed, ain't afraid to look.
Hold your guard, don't get took.

Yeah, I feel my spidey sense tingling, signaling danger.
The street is a beast and she's sleepin' with danger.
We so scared, all we want is to change her.
Waitin' for The Coming, baby, Mary and manger.
I'm so sick, addicted, twisted with it.
My Natural Mystic burn bullshit Hasidic.
Still, satellites like a thief in the night.
From the heavens for a sight, that's an alien flight, real.

Meanwhile, back on the block, it's hot.
People in the cold, holed up in a box.
Watch my back young cutty while I let off my thoughts.
My sixth sense tells me they set off a lot.
My seventh sense says they lie and set five.
To keep us in line, but I've got more eyes.
More cryin' wolf, more dyin' need more lives.
Them veteran sinners send college cash bribes.

Current Affairs to thrill your mental.
They want you p'noid boy, it's simple.
We wide-eyed, ain't afraid to look.
Hold your guard, don't get took.
