Last Laugh Lyrics
by Tyler Major.


Howdy -- dont glorify this establishment 
Already mind blown his eyes closed, the flows, emmaculate 
Certainly, the man lacks vocab and subtlty 

He. Never let the laughing cease. 
But didn't hestitate to let them feel the wrath his adam brings 
Slicker than the 7 seas. Bury me in the current 
Like, a titan ligers lions tigers bears and sea urchin 
Yes. You find it funny. You have a laugh of a _____ 
Considered, a master and by his allies. Such a genius 
Deception is false, spoken and sworn into the best guys. 
Girls of sorts try to mislead them to their oatmeal cream.. 
Sorry ill. Have a burger 
And for dessert its never dry id like to try your myrtle 
Yellow tape, the premasis, nothing to really see here: 
 
Oh, no ... hes on another clepto 
Askin. Why his brothers? Can'T attend to bless his next show 
All mens waitin in line for free samples, 
Of the best flow..slippery when wet forget the crisco 
Shut it up. ... no rhymes need clarity, 
Clear the dry red eyes of the 5'11 blind guy 
Charish thee. five rules. I choose to lace, beats 
Rhyme about myself, so you can feel it like your space key 
Afternoon youtube latest vids by adande 
All. His beats bare and stripped naked, like aguilera, would say: 
Um ... ..whose next on melee 
Matter of fact, i got street fighter covered on asante 
If theyre turnt up now, then, when do they go about 
Like closed doors? I donate to jehovahs witnessing girl scouts. 
5 point 23: maybe you should get faster 
30 metaphors, a minute on -- all -- fours encore ceased laughter.
