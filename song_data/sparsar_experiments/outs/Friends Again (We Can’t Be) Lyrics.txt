Friends Again (We Canâ€™t Be) Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Remember when we danced to Louisiana band the whole night through.
And I thought you were never coming back?
The needle's off the track.
Finally came clean but you've got nothing that I need.
To be honest, we can't be friends again.
To be honest, we can't be friends again.
It's not fair.
What have they done to you?
Well I don't care anymore.
This time I can't help.
You haven't been yourself.
And though time has healed the wound.
There is nothing I can do.
Let's be honest soon.
To be honest, we can't be friends again.
To be honest, we can't be friends again.
You were never coming back.
The needle's off the track.
Finally came clean but you've got nothing that I need.
And though time has healed the wound.
There is nothing I can do.
To be honest, we can't be friends again.
To be honest, we can't be friends again.
To be honest, we can't be friends again.
To be honest, we can't be friends again.
