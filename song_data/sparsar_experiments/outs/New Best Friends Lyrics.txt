New Best Friends Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Just when she thought that things couldn't get much worse.
Just when she thought that things would get better.
It all returns with reinforcements from home.

Now, driven away by her flesh and blood.
All that is left is a growing distrust.
Wrapped in despair and raped emotion....
She cries to Him....

Why won't you save me? Why won't you help me?
With every ounce of me I hope that you will come.
And save me or just help me.
Because deep inside my heart I still believe in you.

The weight of her sorrow is putting her soul to rest.
The pounding of her heart deafens her perception.
She's walking astray, lost within the maze of her mind.

Like the break of a morning, they appear to her.
Just like snowflakes in beautiful winter.
They're making sure that she's alright.
Far from the pain and suffering.

Why wouldn't you save me? Why wouldn't you help me?
With every ounce of me I hoped that you would come.
And save me or just help me....
Because deep inside my heart I did believe in you.

You made me despise you by crushing my faith in you.
But when no one else would care for me, they were there.
They spared me the pain and allowed me to breathe again.
I found the sanctuary I craved in my new best friends.
