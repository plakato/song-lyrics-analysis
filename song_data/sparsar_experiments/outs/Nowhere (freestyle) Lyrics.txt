Nowhere (freestyle) Lyrics
by Yung6ix.

Boys dey vex for the street.
Coz some of them no dey see light.
And.
Eyes dey red for the street.
But we don't sleep on green light.

I'm in the fasting order.
I feel like heavy traffic.
Go against the boy.
The story is probably going tragic.
/ Homie told me get em / x3.
If they cheques ain't gat 1,2,3 comers.
Then it's 4get em.
Coz i'm a rythym.
Simply coz i read them.
Like the bible.
They're so boring.
It's more fun to be Idle.
Talking about things that i do but could slow.
Like i can do.
Bringing more dough to the south.
Than my people can handle.

Now they wanna close up,but this ain't.
Toothpaste.
Never in a hurry.
But i tell them that i do haste.
I see your big dreams.
They look like my minidreams.
My flows are tighter than Rick Ross wearing.
My skinny jeans.
Like BJs.
I told them I'm ahead.
Flyboy,Sick flow,song's flu,Sick bird.
They wanna lie.
Go ahead see bed.
I'm stingy with the flow.
Make thier mama spit bad.
And nigga truth is what I'm spitting.
And I'm hated like a villian.
Be effing the beat for a while.
And am pouring out my feeling.
I'm so sick i need a healing.
Am a miracle to the south,it's what hiphop is.
Revealing.
Leaving them like is the Exodus.
Am newer than the Testament.
Pop pop and Pass him.
You don't really wanna test her men.
I go hard your girl cums,what do you think.
Am metal for.
When i said i'm effing good that wasn't a.
Metaphor.
And i am Nowhere.
No where.
No where.
The south is in the building.
Listen.
Yeah.
And it's from me to you too.
And Yung6ix up in this.
It was nice men.
Eh yo men we live right now.
You know what it is.
From the City where the Sun shine in the.
Dark.
