Vagabond Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


Oh girl I don't know all the reasons why.
I found the answer lookin' in your eye.
I go out walking all day long.
Take away this lonely man soon he will be gone.

Cause I'll tell you everything about living free.
Yes I can see you girl can you see me.

You don't need to know what I do all day.
It's as much as I know watch it waste away.

Go and see the sorcerer look into a ball.
You may find the answer written on the wall.
The left one was a dancer can you see the answer.
Put her in a mansion on top of the hill.
Please don't make her do things against her will.
I found something special I don't know why.
Looking into her pretty little eye.
