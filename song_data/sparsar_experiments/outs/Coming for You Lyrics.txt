Coming for You Lyrics
by Von Grey.

Another morning.
Another sunrise.
Get up and go.
Always moving.
Go faster never slow.
Cause youre running, running,running.
What you gonna do.
Cause theyre coming, coming, coming.
Coming for you.
Dont slip on the morning dew.
Theyll catch up to you.
Cause youre running, running, running.
What you gonna do.
You can cheat and run.
You can lie but you can't hide.
Noooo.
Theyre gonna find you.
Theyre gonna catch you give them time.
Cause youre running, running, running.
What you gonna do.
Cause theyre coming, coming, coming.
Coming for you.
Dont slip on the morning dew.
Theyll catch up to you.
Cause youre running, running, running.
What you gonna do.
Get on your knees and beg for mercy.
Your fate is in the hands.
Of this vengeful clergy.
Are you worthy.
Beg for mercy.
Cause youre running, running, running.
What you gonna do.
Cause theyre coming, coming, coming.
Coming for you.
Dont slip on the morning dew.
Theyll catch up to you.
Cause youre running, running, running.
What you gonna do.
Cause youre running, running, running.
What you gonna do.
Cause theyre coming, coming, coming.
Coming for you.
