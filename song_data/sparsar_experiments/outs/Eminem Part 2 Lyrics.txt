Eminem Part 2 Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Eminem.
It's like that.
Alright bust it.

Eminem.
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns.
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord.
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four.
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford.
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella.
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller.
Got chu' locked in a cellar with your skeleton showin'.
Developin' anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya.
Eatin' a four-course meal watchin' you starve to death.
Put a IV in ya vein feedin' ya liquid Darvaset.
Pumpin' you full of drugs.
Pull the plugs on a gunshot victim full of bullet slugs.
Who were picked up by an ambulance and driven to receiving.
With they asses ripped out of they pants.
And given a less than twenty percent chance of livin'.
Havin' a possible placement as a hospital patient.
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's lil' basement.
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy.
On you while you scream I'm still alive.
Drivin' a rusty scalpel through the top of ya scalp.
I'm pullin' ya Adam's apple out through ya mouth.
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arsonist.
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment.

Laughter.
