Derrick Rose Lyrics
by Yung Berg.


Bitch I'm balling, like 
Boi Rose, 
Boi Rose, 
Boi Rose, 
Boi Rose, 
All, the girls say nigger number, one 
All, the girls say nigger number, one 
 
So come and ball with me. 
 
First quarter feeling like I'm about to drop fifty 
Park the and the drop top Bentley 
Tiger Woods, pimping, 
Charlie, Sheen, living 
Body like a goddess skinny dip with 3 women, 
Crossover hoes, then I work it in the middle 
Put. That D on her make shorty double dribble. 
Now everybody want a slice out of my pie: Kimbo 
I'm number one from the Chi. You ain't get the memo. 
I am in the coupe me and like 3 hoes 
And, they are all on point D-Rose 
Yeah, my swag. So official 
We don't need no referee 
Cause your bitch gon' blow the whistle 
Hawk from Atlanta, a girl named Crystal 
Fuck, her all night and only fed the bitch crystals 
Take them to the crib like B.E.T.. That'S how I'm living 
Then act like I don't know her. 
No bullshit 
 
It's, the M-A-R-V-O 
Uno to these bitches 
You niggas ain't, ballin, 
You, just sellin' tickets, 
Undefeated on the road competition; sorry 
Signal to my shooters. They get open like Ferraris 
Couple games in that's a whole lump of sums, 
Don't be fucking with money or else hear them. Drummers come 
How. You want it Rat-tat-tatter or pa-rum-pum-pum-pum 
Fuck that chatter, how you shatter when I drop them. Dum-Dums huh 
Supreme balling on these bitches yeah. I stunts hard 
In the game, shooting like a nigga with a gun card, 
Raise a sharp line with the number one guard 
23's on my feet: pocket full of
Trump cards. 
Get, your girlfriend think she off the liquor 
Shawty playing offense. She gon' be the sticker 
Full court pressure game on her. Then I strip her 
Take her to the hole fadeaway
I nail. The picture
