Diamonds Lyrics
by Que.


Diamond watch just shine, if I look, I might go blind.
Light rays in the way, so please don't ask me what time it is.
Icebox hanging, got my body feeling froze.
Bitch, I done came up, nigga, now I'm on some boss shit.
Now all of a sudden these hoes going crazy.
But I know what it is and I ain't the one to save ‘em.
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
I know these hoes only want a nigga cause.

All these diamonds, hanging off of me.
I got an icebox, where my heart used to be.
Just look at my watch, yeah, it's a masterpiece.
Now a nigga came up, I got these hoes after me.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.

My diamonds dancing and my charm it cost.
a fortune.
Got your hoe star struck, now she wanna take a portrait.
Grab some ice up out my chain, put it in my drink.
Rollie on my wrist with the flooded face.
When you get money, watch how the hoes flock.
They chase me like a cop and I ain't even pop.
One shot of the brown will make your bitch go.
And she ain't a hoe, shit it might just be.

All these diamonds, hanging off of me.
I got an icebox, where my heart used to be.
Just look at my watch, yeah, it's a masterpiece.
Now a nigga came up, I got these hoes after me.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.

Keep in mind that diamonds are a girl's best friend.
Don't be surprised when she see me and her neck bend.
I might swap a different watch with every time zone.
And these real diamonds in ‘em nigga.
Ain't no rhinestones, they might hypnotise ya hoe.
And leave her mind blown, gave her creeping.
Sending pictures to my iPhone, writing captions like.
“Look how much that I've grown”, oh, she fell in love with.

These diamonds, hanging off of me.
I got an icebox, where my heart used to be.
Just look at my watch, yeah, it's a masterpiece.
Now a nigga came up, I got these hoes after me.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
Yeah, they chasing, chasing, yeah, you know why they chasing.
