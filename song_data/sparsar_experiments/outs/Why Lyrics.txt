Why Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.

I'm reminiscing like JOE, staring at faded pictures.
Through Satan's tempting and death.
Back resurrected as the greatest victor.
Throughout my travels sampled great elixirs.
Liquor's and weed.
Feel like I'm bleeding, need a way to fix this.
Pain that I feed.
I told'em Go head I ain't coming.
Bed being Co - Ed stop being fun.
And I can't even sleep.
Stress running my mind.
Got diamonds but don't none of em' shine.
My heart is heavy.
Every problem weigh a ton at a time.
Stay isolated cause' I'm one of a kind.
Fake homies claiming that they got my back.
But every one of em' lying.
My label jerking me forever jacking.
But like Jeremiah this fire got in my bones.
Now I'm forever rapping.
I took the bitter with the sweet.
Never quitters we keep.
Teaching like ghetto Messiah's to deliver the streets.
Became a son of God as soon as I admitted I'm weak.
And gave back what was given to me.
I don't understand why.

I don't know why.
You gotta lie.
Think I'm gon' try.
Take your piece of the pie.

Scheme and you cheat.
Cheat and you lie.
I don't understand why they keep playing with me.
I don't know why.
You gotta lie.
Think I'm gon' try.
Take your piece of the pie.
Scheme and you cheat.
Cheat and you lie.
I'm a grown man now quit playing with me.

No y'all ain't ready for it.
I don't think they ready for it.
Really y'all ain't ready for it.
I don't think they ready for it.
Y'all think y'all ready for it.
I don't think they ready for it.
Who think they ready for it?
I don't think they ready.

This hip-hop, rock, soul.
Is all we do around here.
I spit a lot.
Practicing flowing while I'm doing my hair.
From Little Rock.
Some of em' said I wasn't going nowhere.
But I had confidence these poems I share'd be embraced by many.
Said you way too skinny.
Nobody gave me anything.
Be singing at my job while I slave for pennies.
I love emceeing.
Love to be in the studio locked.
Haters that knocked gon' see me rocking at coliseums.
I used to cry watching these video shows.
Pitiful.
Artist with silly flows.
They gotta be kidding.
Yo, why we dope and got it hard like this?
I don't understand it my band is making all these hits.
And I feel abandoned by labels cause' they all insist.
I should straighten my hair to hit it.
I'm real but they don't get it.
Every mic I lit it.
For fans I stay committed.

We make a dollar we split it.
Tell me why.

None of y'all ain't ready for it.
I don't think they ready for it.
No y'all ain't ready for it.
I don't think they ready for it.
Y'all think y'all ready for it.
I don't think they ready for it.
But y'all ain't ready for it.
I don't think they ready.

I'm gon' stay ready.
I'ma stay ready.

Ready for whatever.
Ready for whoever.
You ain't gon' never catch us slipping.
This is Hiprocksoul.
It don't matter what they say.
Tena Jones gon' be ready.
We all gon' be ready.
4th Avenue gon' stay ready.
We gon' be ready.
We gon' stay ready.
We been putting it down for so long.
I'm ready.
I've been ready all my life.
I've been ready all my life.
So every thing will be all right.
