White Unicorn Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


Have you been to the carnival.
I would like to see you.
There's a whole lot of people there.
Who would like to be you.
With the white unicorn, across her shoulder.
Makes you think that she might of been.
Someone whose older, ahh yeahhh.

And I know it's on your mind.
We've been drinking on the wine.
That we drank from the serpents vine.
Now we live in another time.

We could live together.

She lives on the borderline.
That they call hazel.
And the tent that she lives in has the name of her lover.
As she lays down to rest, she dreamt of another.
Of a time when she once had.

Sister can you tell me when the day turns to night.
She left without a word and wondered inside.
How many day's must I still wonder why.
And see her face in every passer by.
