Damn Good Friends Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.


You're drivin' back home down 246.
You almost hit a deer and you end up in a ditch.
You can't pull forward and you can't back out.
You're sittin' there thinkin' whatcha gonna do now.
You'd be a little nervous if a cop showed up.
‘Cause you drank a little maybe just a little too much.
Waitin' on a tow truck takes too long.
It's two in the mornin'…who you gonna call.

Friends…damn good friends.
Seven minutes later they're pullin' you out.
You know the ones I'm talkin' about.
Friends…damn good friends.
You can count ‘em all on one of your hands.
You got a hundred buddies.
A couple of damn good friends.

So you're all shootin' pool on a Saturday night.
This little brunette keeps givin' you the eye.
So you buy her a drink, before too long.
You're out on the floor in the middle of a song.
About that time her ex shows up.
He's starin' you down getting' all bowed up.
He's a big ol' jacked up S.O.B.
That's alright he's about to meet your…

Friends…damn good friends.
A few seconds later he's startin' to see.
It ain't one on one…it's one on three.
Friends…damn good friends.
They do it for you ‘cause you'd do it for them.
You got a hundred buddies.
But a couple of damn good friends.

They're there even when you don't see ‘em as much.
Cause you moved away or you fell in love.
But they're wearin' a tux when you're sayin' your vows.
And if you crash and burn you can crash on their couch.

Friends…damn good friends.
They love you like a brother there ain't no doubt.
You know the ones I'm talkin' about.
Friends…damn good friends.
You can count 'em all on one of your hands.
You got a hundred buddies.
And a couple of damn good friends.
Oh damn good friends.
