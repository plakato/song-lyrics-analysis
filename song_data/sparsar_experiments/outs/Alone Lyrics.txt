Alone Lyrics
by P.U.R.P..


Im high fuck right now
I was puffing dink right now
Got. This noise ring
And these gold chains
These dope kush that we smokeecho
And these dope hoes
That. We fuckecho
My sneaker, game
On, point
Got adidas on feet
Everybody, know my clique
We swag dope
Everybody know my clique
And. We high
Everybody know my boy
Cause his oddy
Yung hustle fam. Be my team
And craving for a fucken shawty
Guess. What niggas going to a party
And fenna smash
All i need is cash
To just get to the joint
Ain't. No doubt
Imma fucking enjoy
And smoking. Getting this shawtys
And fucking smashing these hotties
And fucking dodging the police
Im high as fuck
And. You know it
That alcohol just keep pouring
And these fake niggas be boring
And. These bad bitches be twerking
Before. You know, it
I`ll be fucking horny
Before, you know, it
I`ll be fucking on it
Before. You know it
I`ll be fucking boning
Hate, being lonely for over 2 hours
 Gim me that guap, maybe i might have that power

Imma. Take your chick
And leave you as her X-men
Im worivene. You call me hughman
Im stuggy with my beats
The coloreds, say: im slacks man
I do rap cause. I love it
Thats, my passion
Im too sick
Im forever be a patient
So holy
Turn, an earthist to christian
Golden cross
Now, call that chris-chain
I rock gold chains
But shit just be fake
But I'mma get real chains
Once. I get paid

Alone: oh oh
