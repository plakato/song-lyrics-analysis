Life Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

I've seen the light.
And I've seen it fade.
And I walked away.
Still I'm okay.
I remember the pain inside.
On the day when my mother died.
Never went away.
It's still here today.

Your born alone.
You die alone.
And still we live on.
See, yesterday is a memory.
Tomorrow is a vision.
But today, it's a bitch.
Yesterday is a memory.
Tomorrow is a vision.
But today, it's a bitch.

And my baby, he went to sleep.
In his mothers arms, we prayed to keep.
The shadow away.
He never lived a day.
Best friend called me up to say.
With a gun in his hand said he's goin crazy.
Said you'll be okay.
He still died the next day.

Your born alone.
You die alone.
And still we live on.
See, yesterday is a memory.
Tomorrow is a vision.
But today, it's a bitch.
Yesterday is a memory.
Tomorrow is a vision.
But today, it's a bitch.

I stood in line.
I've lost my pride.
I've made the change.
I'm a better man today.
Death brings life.
Still we try.
To live a better way.
Before your dyin' day.....

Your born alone.
You die alone.
And still we live on.
See, yesterday is a memory.
Tomorrow is a vision.
But today, it's a bitch.
Yesterday is a memory.
Tomorrow is a vision.
But today, it's a bitch.

Yesterday is a memory.
But today, it's a bitch.
Yesterday is a memory.
Tomorrow is a vision.....
