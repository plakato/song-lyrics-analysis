12 AM Lyrics
by Que.


Hit me on that late night tip.
Just a little after midnight, uh.
She be hitting me on some late night shit.
After hitting me up to get right, uh.
On some late night shit, little after midnight, uh.
She be creeping on some late night shit.
She just out tryna get right, uh.
She just out to get pipe, no delays.
On my way right now, bitch I'm on my way.
Hit me on that late night tip.
Hit you with that late night dick.
Know I won't trip, let me slip em off.
Shawty we could do it all, never taking off.
We could ball till we fall till the.
Motherfucking sun come back up.

She only call me after 12 when I'm picking up.
She know how to get it up, she can't get enough.
When that clock strike 12.
I be waiting for her phone call rolling up a L.
So you can get your mind right.
She just my type, and she keep it tight, aw!

Till the, motherfucking bus come.
And you, yelling to the, tip top of your lungs.
When you motherfucking bust one, oh.
Keep in mind, you fucking with a boss.
So what you waiting for? Gon' slip em off.
Right now!
