Becoming Self-Aware Lyrics
by The Swellers.

I can't see through this transparency.
But I guess I've been wrong about everything.
So should I lie, or dumb myself down to feel okay?
Or do I phone it in awhile until the feeling goes away?
I'm on the outside looking in.
And I don't see you again.
You know exactly where I've been.
Becoming self-aware.
Becoming self-aware.
I'm thinking.
I half believe that I don't care anymore.
Walking like an old man, but feeling immature.
We've learned we won't agree on anything.
The line drawn in the sand.
Rethinking where I'm standing now.
And if I'll ever stand a chance.
I know, I know.
I could call this home.
But I don't want to make this awkward.
I won't. I know.
I could call this home.
But I don't want to make this awkward anymore.
