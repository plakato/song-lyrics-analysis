Almost Human Lyrics
by Voltaire.

What did I ever do to you.
That you should treat me this way?
Is it really such a crime.
For an angel to speak his mind?
In time I'll try to shed some light.
If I were a big boy.
I wouldn't cry.
But since I'm not a big boy.
I'll have to cry.

What did I ever do so wrong.
That you should cast me from grace.
Though I love to rule in Hell here.
How I miss the taste of Heaven.
Its soft and cool embrace.
If I were a big boy.
I wouldn't cry.
But since I'm not a big boy.
I'll have to close my eyes.
And picture what it's like.

I'm just like you.
Made by He.
Despised by they.
I'm almost me.
I'm nearly human.
Look at me.
I'm almost a human being.

I'm just like you.
Made by He.
Despised by they.
I'm almost me.
I'm nearly human.
Pity me.
I'm almost a human being.

I still remember your light.
And it was streaming down.
And burning out my eyes.
If I were a big boy.
I wouldn't cry.
But since I'm not a big boy.
I'll have to close my eyes.
And picture what it's like.

I'm just like you.
Made by He.
Despised by they.
I'm almost me.
I'm nearly human.
Look at me.
I'm almost a human being.

These tears are real.
I'm jealousy.
I'm spite and hate.
To the core I'm mean.
I'm nearly human.
Look at me.
I'm almost a human being.

I'm just like you.
Better than He.
To Hell with they.
I'm almost me.
I'm nearly human.
Pity me.
I'm almost a human being.

Don't touch me, oh.
I couldn't bear the thought of it, now.
Don't touch me, oh.
I couldn't bear the strain.
Don't touch me, oh.
I couldn't bear the thought of it, now.
Touch me.
Touch me.
Touch me.
Don't touch me.
Touch me.
Touch me.
