Full Metal 2 Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.

We came a long way.
Too far to turn back.
No choice but to keep going.
We ready doe.
Grrahhh.

I got bad bitches, every city.
My niggas livin' lavish but they all gritty.
We go out and we get it and we split the profit.
I'm keepin' to myself cause I ain't with the gossip.
I'm stickin' to the script, I'm a money getter.
Wig splitter, weed smoker, I don't do the liquor.
But I do the twitter, DM ya big sister.
Full Metal, don't hide cause I'm gone getcha.
Pull up on your block with the drop top.
Got my haters lookin' salty cause I'm everything they not.
Got them pretty bitches on me, you still fuckin' with them thots.
Rollin' up that loud pack, I can't hear what you talkin' 'bout.
Tell them niggas come and find me, you know I be duckin' off.
But if I found out you a snake, then Imma have to cut you off.
I was in the back seat and I seen you walk it out.
Boy, don't come to me with that beef cause we don't talk it out.

My hittas will get you.
The Nina gone kiss you.
Ya family gone miss you.
I swerve in the rental, I'm doin' 120, she givin' me temple.
I'm schoolin' these rappers and trappin' with lyrics.
You see how I'm snappin'.
I be wildin' out, I be wildin' out.
Call a Mariah, Nick Cannon.
Bad bitches only.
Big bands on me.
I'm a 305 nigga.
Get in line nigga and I promise you will know me.
The fans want the old me, but fuck it I ain't change.
I'm a big dog now and my fans so deranged.
Stop hating on a nigga.
While I'm doing my thing.
Cause this shit don't stop 'till the fat lady sings.

Fat blunts over here.
Shut Up and Vibe.
Yung Simmie.
