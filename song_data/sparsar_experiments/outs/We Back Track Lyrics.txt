We Back Track Lyrics
by Work 'n Progress.

Background.
Right now.
I thought you didn't restart, bro?
Shut up.

W.P. progression.
I'm a Nephilim.
Google search if you're just pressing questions.
Resurrection.
Learn a lesson.
Teacher and I'm back.
Preacher when I rap.
Backpack on my last lap.
With this last laugh.
Only speaking facts when I rap.
Not speak in tongues.
I'm numb to the fact.
That you're dumb to the fact.
That Wolfpack outta the box like Jack.
Outta the world and off the map.
I'm mad like Max.
Yeah, I'm mad like Max.
Mel Gibson, don't listen.
Deaf to the B.S. my own prescription.
Fuck your life my own decisions.
Fuck your wife my own decision.
And I choose wisely, I choose nightly.
I might be slightly truly fighting the urge to fuck.
And splurge and cut, cuz I'm not going back nicely.
Flew the coop, cut the noose.
Bleached the blues, got the shots reach the hoop.
Beat the news review that's where you stay.
Fuck this town, where I lay.
Where I lie, it's all lies.
D.C. in the eyes no backtrack no rewind.
My state of mind is stated fine.
Far from ten and close to nine.
Numbers, no wonder I'm lost.
Like my summer.
I'm a wolf, and you're thumper.
Just call me, head hunter.

This We Back Track no backtrack.
Wolfpack on the fast track, fast track.
X2.
Zoom.

I'm probably pimping, drinking, skipping school.
Got my higher education I got better things to do.
What city to rule my crew kings among thieves and thugs.
Get the best girls and the Betta Drugs.
Like the top, here we come, no one can stop us.
It's Progress we pros at this.
Floating, rolling, fighting, writing, I'm a tyrant bitch.
Wolfpack, we know no limits.
Wolfpack, we fucking vicious.
Wolfpack, I'm that Ginga killa spitta illa rhyme than Jigga in a shorter time.
I get mine like gimme dat.
Probably fucked your bitch.
With no jimmy hat.
I'm raw.
I'm the best that you ever done did saw.
Haha, that's the last laugh.
I done had dat.
Psycho, no backtrack.
Might go bad rap mad wrath.
No telling where we'll go we fast track.
No slowing our roll we past that.
There's havoc to be had.
Hazards hardly humble a man.
Some turn up.
Little more than water in my dixie cup.
Got a bitch too, think she drunk in love.
I find her annoying but I love the song.
Never hit the gym but I'm hella strong.
Believe me, I beat up every beat I'm on.
