Let's Dance To Joy Division Lyrics
by The Wombats.


I'm back in Liverpool.
And everything seems the same.
But I worked something out last night.
That changed this little boy's brain.
A small piece of advice.
That took twenty-two years in the make.
And I will break it for you now.
Please learn from my mistakes.
Please learn from my mistakes.

Let's dance to Joy Division.
And celebrate the irony.
Everything is going wrong.
But we're so happy.
Let's dance to Joy Division.
And raise our glass to the ceiling.
Cause this could all go so wrong.
But we're so happy.
Yeah we're so happy.

So if you're ever feeling down.
Grab your purse and take a taxi.
To the darker side of town.
That's where we'll be.
And we will wait for you and lead you through the dance floor.
Up to the DJ booth.
You know what to ask for.
You know what to ask for.

Let's dance to Joy Division.
And celebrate the irony.
Everything is going wrong.
But we're so happy.
Let's dance to Joy Division.
And raise our glass to the ceiling.
Cause this could all go so wrong.
But we're so happy.
Yeah we're so happy.

So let the love tear us apart.
I've found the cure for a broken heart.
Let it tear us apart.
Let the love tear us apart.
I've found the cure for a broken heart.
Let it tear us apart.

So let the love tear us apart.
I've found the cure for a broken heart.
Let it tear us apart.

So let the love tear us apart.
I've found the cure for a broken heart.
Let it tear us apart.
Let it tear us apart.
Let it tear us apart.

Let's dance to Joy Division.
And celebrate the irony.
Everything is going wrong.
But we're so happy.
Let's dance to Joy Division.
And raise our glass to the ceiling.
Cause this could all go so wrong.
But we're so happy.
Yeah we're so happy.
