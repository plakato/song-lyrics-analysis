Colder Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

I probably could have turned and found.
A way to make you stop and say this.
Sometimes the truth will burn.
Your pride will hurt if you're the one who's waiting.

I guess it's time to say the words, It's over.
And time to leave these ruins as they smolder.

I should have walked away.
When I saw you looking over your shoulder.
I knew it right away.
When you looked at me that way it was colder.
Yeah, you were colder.

You had me by the hand.

Redrew every line and took your time.
And mapped out how you'd go alone.

I guess it's time to say the words, It's over.
It's time to leave these ruins as they smolder.

I should have walked away.
When I saw you looking over your shoulder.
I knew it right away.
When you looked at me that way it was colder.
Yeah, it was colder.

How'd you even kiss my lips.
When you wanted goodbye?
And how'd you just stand right there.
Look through the lies?

I guess it's time to say the words, It's over.
And time to leave these ruins as they smolder.

I should have walked away.
When I saw you looking over your shoulder.
I knew it right away.
When you looked at me that way it was colder.
Yeah, it was colder.
I guess it's over.

Wish I had found a way to make you stop and stay.
But it's over.
