Black Hand Side (clean version) Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.


Oh baby baby, ahh yeah, clap your hands y'all.

Check it, dig it while i rip it.
Check it while i wreck it.

Ok gimme a few seconds.
First I give a shout to every Jersery born and bread head.
And everybody in new york from to brunettes to read heads.

Who got my back?

Yo tell me who's got my back?

Yo tell me who's got my back?

Yo yo yo yo who's got my back.

Thank you as I come back in to the beat.
Give a shout out to my brother L.A.N.C.E.
Up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me.
You know you're too good to be forgotten.
Poppa wasn't here but there was Lance in the house.
It's only me and mommy you the man of the house.

Always flip the scipt back to the old days.
I used to rock it on the high school stage.
I used to drink 40s back then I didn't blaze.
Twitched to the pipe with the peace these days.

Just go on to let you know I flow on.
I'm wicked out my gluteus so ho on and ho on.

That's what we about to do.

Take you on a mission with the Flavor U.

Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop.
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop.

But chill.

Just chill.

Yo chill.

Uh.

Come on chill.

Check it fear don't live in here.
Tears don't bring me cheers.
So gear for another year because I had it up to here.

Yeah, I'm about through with you.
You whack and bootie pooh with.
Rip up the crew left and right hear the one and the two.

I'm read-to-set-it-off again.
Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin.
In fact don't make me have to get the royal getcha.
Best ta your narrow ass up off that crack.

Booking any show when I know that I'll pack it.
Attacking with my tactics.
I'm loaded like a full metal jacket.

I'll flip mines to get mines.
I'm happy to get with you.
But you can't come out to play.
Right now you got to much shit to do.

It's all game it all sounds the same.
The suckas know my name is sitting on the tips of their brains.
But they shame, they scared to face me.
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me.
They must be freaking crazy.

I'm the la la la from haulstead.
Bread with the queen with a prefix.
It's off with your head.
And that's a promise cause I don't make threats.
So mind your neck cause it's about to get set.

C'mon set it off.

Uh, set it off.

Somebody set it off.

Watch somebody set it off.

Ah.

Check the queen set it off.
Parley.

Ah uh, yeah.
Black reign 1993.
I'd like to welcome you to this album.
Matter of fact I'd like to welcome you to a new day.
A new day to hear me.

Check this out ya'll.
