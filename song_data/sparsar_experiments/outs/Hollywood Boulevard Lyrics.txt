Hollywood Boulevard Lyrics
by The Undead.


The full moon's light broken by the blades of a helicopter.
People screaming, running, lights flashing.
Suddenly, a beam of light from the overhead chopper, detects my presence.
He radios to the ground troops and a hundred, or more black leather boots.
Helmets hiding expressionless faces brandishing clubs, turn.
And begin to pursue me down a bloody boulevard.
Seeking refuge, I duck into a dark alley.
An unseen hand, covers my mouth and nostrils.

I'm looking over my shoulder and I'm keeping my nose clean.
I'm on Hollywood Boulevard, in facist Germany.
The moon is full and the streets are lined in blue.
I'm on Hollywood Boulevard, they're coming after you.
They're coming out.
They're coming out.
They're coming out in force tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out.
So watch out for those flashing lights.
Motorcycles buzzing, helicopters overhead.
I think of another time and place and wish that I was dead.
I see the people running, I see where people died.
I try to see shelter, but there's noplace left to hide.
They're coming out.
They're coming out.
They're coming out in force tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out.
So watch out for those flashing lights.
They're coming out in force tonight.
So watch out for those flashing lights.
I see what had moments ago been my best friend's.
Now lifeless, battered, bloody body barely recognizable.
Come day or night, the black and white.
Are looking out for you.
And come the time you're out of line.
They'll bring it down on you.
They're coming out.
They're coming out.
They're coming out in force tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out.
So watch out for those flashing lights.
They're coming out.
They're coming out.
They're coming out in force tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out.
So watch out for those flashing lights.
They're coming out.
They're coming out tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out tonight.
They're coming out.
They're coming out tonight.
