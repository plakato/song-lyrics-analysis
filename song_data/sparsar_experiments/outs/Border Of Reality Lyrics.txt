Border Of Reality Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

I'm trying to think.
But I can't catch my thoughts.
Confusion is reigning my mind.

The void in your word.
Should cause me to fear.
The coldness is getting near.

Clear my eyes.
Let me see.
I'm going to lose my aim.
Show me the sense.

The propecies are raining, down from the sky.
But answers are not to be found.

The longing for something that we cannot find.
Uncovers our fatal disguise.

Clear my eyes.
Let me see.
I'm going to lose my aim.
Show me the sense.

Let me fall.
Let me dream - of beauty and truth -.
Let me feel.
Let me see - the border of reality.

Now that we all have percieved our fate.
Reality lies and the lie lives in me.
Is it all over or will it go on.
I'm surewe have nothing to fear.
