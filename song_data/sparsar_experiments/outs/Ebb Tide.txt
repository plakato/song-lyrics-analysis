Ebb Tide
by The Unicorns.

There is a place where.
There is a place where.
There is a place where.
There is a place where.
There is a place where.
There is a place where.
There is a place where.
There is a place where no clouds go.

And you know.
That when you go.
No one may follow.
No one may follow.

When we arrived in picturesque paradise.
We lay on our backs and the open sky looked so nice.
This is a place where your legs don't chaffe.
Can't come back I gotta' swim in synch with the north star.
