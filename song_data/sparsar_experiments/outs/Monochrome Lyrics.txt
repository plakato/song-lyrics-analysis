Monochrome Lyrics
by Ruse.

Slow down.
We're gonna take our time and make this right.
Drag out.
Everything that's eating at your mind.
So I deceived you cause I can't believe you and now I've turned the tide.
So monochrome.
I watched the color drain from you.
Where's the color in this life?
Watch me doing all you've always feared.
Just try and stop me.
Pulling all the strings I can from here.
So I deceived you oh.
So monochrome I watched the color drain from you.
Where's the color in this life.
So monochrome.
I took all I feared in you and that you must despise.
It feels so good not to need you.
It feels so good not to need you.
But it's so sad to watch you fall.
Cause I took it all.
So I deceived you cause I can't believe you and now I've turned the tide.
So monochrome.
I watched the color drain from you.
Where's the color in this life?
So monochrome.
I took all I feared in you and that you must despise.
