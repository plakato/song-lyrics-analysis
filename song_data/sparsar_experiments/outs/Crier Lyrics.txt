Crier Lyrics
by Sway UK.


We can all lose control, on this winding road.
So I wrote you this song to share all that I know.

Welcome to this planet, our innocent baby.
Try to understand it, this World is so crazy.
I promise to give you, the words that God gave me, now.
We share.
All over the globe we are killing each other.
Religions and riches, as people we suffer.
No matter their skin that's your sister and brother, so.
Say a prayer.
Embrace all our colours.
Be patient and honest.
Keep faith in your heart.
Some believe God's above us.
So give if you've got it.
Have trust in abundance, now.
Always be fair.
Don't get caught up in numbers.
From tens to the hundreds.
A billion's only a billion once.
So have sympathy, symphony.
Sing me a song when you cry.

Ruth Brown &amp; Choir.
Crier, crier, crier, crier crier yer yer yer.
Cry if you hear me o.

Crier, crier, crier, crier crier yer yer yer.
Cry if you hear.

Build your foundations on love and not passion.
Express your emotions.
Explore your own talents.
Make plans and take action.
No matter what happens, we.
All make mistakes.
See life's full of lessons.
Appreciate blessings.
Don't harbour regrets or be scared to ask questions.
No need for a gun, use your mind as a weapon now.
Ready and aim.
Success is not measured in wealth but in presence.
And time is a gift.
See your health as investment.
Spend it like it's precious.
Centuries down to seconds, but.
You don't have to rush.
And beware of the words like greed, envy or jealous.
We all have a purpose from sheep up to shepherd.
Even as a leader, we're equal in a sense, now.

Ruth Brown &amp; Choir.
Crier, crier, crier, crier crier yer yer yer.
Cry if you hear me o.

Crier, crier, crier, crier crier yer yer yer.
Cry if you hear me o.

2 Ruth Brown, Hannah Johnson &amp; Choir.
We can all lose control, on this winding road.

Crier yer yer yer.
Cry if you hear me o.

So I wrote you this song to share all that I know.

Crier yer yer yer.
Cry if you hear.

Never cry for the money.
Never cry for the fame.
You should cry for the joy.
You should cry for the pain.
Let it pour like the rain.
Be who ever you'll be.
I'm proud that you carry my name.
And I pray you'll be better than me.

Now.
Never cry for the money.
Never cry for the fame.
You should cry for the joy.
You should cry for the pain.
Let it pour like the rain.
Be who ever you'll be.
I'm just proud that you carry my name.
And I pray that you're better than me.

Ruth Brown &amp; Choir.
Cryer, cryer, cryer, cryer cryer yer yer yer.
Cry if you hear me o.

Cryer, cryer, cryer, cryer cryer yer yer yer.
Cry if you hear.
