Falling Too Lyrics
by Tyler Joseph.


You walk around like you are fine.
So confident in life, so right.
But then I found you were afraid.
And that means life is not okay.

I wonder what's inside your mind.
And if there's anything to find.
I hope that you awake some day.
And see that life is not okay.

I will sing for you a song.
Tell me if you think that's wrong.
If I let you know I'm here.
Cause I am falling down.
I would laugh away the pain.
Did you know I'd run all day.
Just to maybe hear you say.
That you are falling too.

I know you are afraid of many things.
But you need to let go.
If you want to sing a praise.

I will sing for you a song.
Tell me if you think that's wrong.
If I let you know I'm here.
Cause I am falling down.
I would laugh away the pain.
Did you know I'd run all day.
Just to maybe hear you say.
That you are falling too.

I will sing for you.
I will sing for you.
