Oil Rainbow Lyrics
by Volcanoes.

I feel like an immigrant setting sale to my own mind.
In a see of faces and figures with no features and empty eyes.
The destination is fuzzy, all I can see now is the flames.
I try to speak but no words come out, my mouth's taped shut.

I feel like an immigrant setting sale to my own mind, a dark place full of.
metal and steel and live landmines.
We're all on this ship but we're not going to the.
Same place.
Visions of something getting closer but I can't see its face.

The destination is fuzzy all I can see now is the flames.
I try to speak but no words come out, my mouth's taped shut.
