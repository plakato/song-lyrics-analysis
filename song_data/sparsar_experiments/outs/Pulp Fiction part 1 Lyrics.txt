Pulp Fiction part 1 Lyrics
by U-N-I.


In a world where the American Dream isn't enough: 
Two men plan to satisfy their hunger for wealth, 
Starring Thurzday as the Narrator 
Y-O as Mike 
And Fashawn, as Cedric 
You, are about to enter Pulp Fiction. ... Now Playing 
, 
Uh., Half gone, half crazy, 
His H-Spoon-Coon. He could never forget. 
He looked in the mirror loose his self respect, 
Spat in his reflection, playin Russian Roulette 
Put a spear to the barrel and grabbed the O-E 
Pour, a sip of Molt Liqour pour sip for the homie 
He was like a brother different mother. Same block 
And that blue magic money didn't deserve that shot. 
That went through the vest out his back through his chest: 
And flat line his heart after cardiac arrest, 
Looked in the mirror without further ado, 
Pointed the gun, It's gone, be me or you, ..., 
, 
, Y-O,
