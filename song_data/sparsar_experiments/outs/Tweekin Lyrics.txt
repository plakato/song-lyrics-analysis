Tweekin Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


Everytime I go outside, I'm tweakin', 
Oh, 
 
I might pop a molly. I might pop a xan 
I might pop a nigga, then I'll pop his mans 
Got. The .40. In my fuckin' hand, 
Make that nigga do the runnin' man 
 
Everywhere, I go niggas say I'm tweakin 
I just be smokin, chiefin' 
Everywere I go them. Niggas say I'm tweakin' 
I just be livin'. You sleepin' 
 
I, just caught a body like last night. 
That boy was a cut that was his last life. 
Already got two. This is my last strike. 
They say that I be tweakin' off that glass pipe 
 
Kill a nigga for no reason like a homicide. 
Anytime I come through them. Niggas know its drama time. 
2-2-3'S! That'S choppa time, 
Fuck with me. You traumatized 
I'm paranoid like Dolla, Sign, 
I'm paranoid like Dolla, Sign, 
 
Who, the fuck. You think it was 
My name V-Nasty. I need the drugs 
I catch a body. I show no love 
I'm from the streets where times get tough 
 
Got enough. So I share my plate. 
Fuck them niggas that wan na hate, I'm grinding, like I'm number 8 
I'm movin' bricks like state to state 
Get them bitches up out the way 
 
Boy. You know I'm tweekin' ho
