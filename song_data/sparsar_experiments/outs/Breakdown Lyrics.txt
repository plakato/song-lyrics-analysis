Breakdown Lyrics
by Sweet.

Yesterday I flew straight into tomorrow.
Today I'm gonna lose.
The ups and the downs.
And the seeds that they sow.

Blowin' hot and cold.
Must be getting old.
Everybody knows.
The cubes that you knock back.
Won't reincarnate.
You are trapped it's your fate.
Very soon it's too late.
So you give up and.

Break down, stay down.
Break down, low down.
Break down, stay down.
Stay down, break down.

Head is playin' tricks.
Colours are appearin'.
But black and white don't mix.
With stories I'm hearing.
They're bringing me down.

If you don't help me soon.
I think I'm going crazy.
I just broke up the room.
Give me a piece of the.
World that I know.
Where the seeds that I sow.
Are the minds that I blow.
So I give up and.

Break down, stay down.
Break down, low down.
Break down, stay down.
Stay down, break down.
