In Your Wake Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

A selfish man, a wretch I do stand, just as you we are the same.
But how is it that justice follows in Your wake and grace remains?
And grace remains? Your grace remains! Still grace remains!

This is justice for my wickedness with your Son descending.
Onto this world bearing our sin.
We're helpless in need of Your grace.
This freedom is not in our hands.
Still Your grace remains.

It was not nails that kept You there on that tree.
It was not thorns that caused You your pain.
For it was my sin, it was Your burden.
It was my sin, it was Your love for me.
It was not nails that kept You there on that tree.
It was not thorns that caused You your pain.
For it was my sin, it was Your burden.
It was my sin, it was Your love for me.

Then at the cross You bore my sin.
And as You bled You thought of me.
And still these bones will cry.
Who am I that you would give Your life and die for me?

Not just a myth and not just a story.
Becoming my sin and all for His glory.
Not just a martyr, not just a saint.
He's risen, alive.
Death had no restraint!

Bride, arise! And lift up His holy name.
Oh yea bride, arise! And life up His name.
It was not nails that kept You there on that tree.
It was not thorns that caused You your pain.
For it was my sin, it was Your burden.
It was my sin, it was Your love for me.

Then at the cross You bore my sin.
And as You bled You thought of me.
And still these bones will cry.
Who am I that you would give Your life and die for me?
