Diamonds shining swinging it side ways Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Ice on my chain diamonds shining swinging it side ways haters got me wrong.
when i walk in sight tattoos are my work of art on my skin see better with the.
eye doctor where should i go if i can't see right walls show best work of art.
to the world to see shades on at night nice view to see i keep on walking.
straight.
