Blank Space Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.


Nice to meet you, where you been?
I can show you incredible things.
Magic, madness, heaven, sin.
Saw you there and I thought.
Oh my God, look at that face.
You look like my next mistake.
Love's a game, you want to play?
New money, suit &amp; tie.
I can read you like a magazine.
Ain't it funny, rumors fly.
And I know you heard about me.
So hey, let's be friends.
I'm dying to see how this one ends.
Grab your passport and my hand.

So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames.
You can tell me when it's over if the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane.
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game.
So goddamn reckless, we'll take this way too far.
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar.
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane.
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your name.

Cherry lips, crystal skies.
I could show you incredible things.
Stolen kisses, pretty lies.
I'm you're king and you're my queen.
Find out what you want, be that girl for a month.
Wait the worst is yet to come.
Screaming, crying, perfect storms.
I can make all the tables turn.
Rose garden filled with thorns.
Keeping you second guessing like.
Oh my God, who is she?, you get drunk on jealousy.
But you'll come back each time you leave.

So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames.
You can tell me when it's over if the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane.
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game.
So goddamn reckless, we'll take this way too far.
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar.
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane.
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your name.
I'll write your name.
I'll write your name.
I'll write your name.
