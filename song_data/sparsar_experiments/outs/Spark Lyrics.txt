Spark Lyrics
by The sweet remains.

Somebody said somethin' once, I never will forget.
He said Love is like a blindfold, it's a shot in the dark..
Girl when I met you I was back to the wall.
One last round and I started, staight from the heart.
And I saw a spark.
I saw a spark.
Somebody said somethin' else once, I never will forget.
I was just a boy, but it stuck with me.
She said if you got something good you gotta to hold on to it.
So darling won't you please come and stay with me.
And be my spark.
And be my spark.
Somebody said somethin' else once, I almost did forget.
He said Man, I can't help it, see no woods for the trees..
Once upon a time, babe, I felt like that.
But these days your light shines, always in me.
Inside my heart.
Inside my heart.
Cause I been waiting so long for somebody.
Oh someone to melt free this frozen heart.
Darling won't you please be my silver spark.
Ohh oh oh.
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
Da da da da da da da da da da da da.
Da da da da da da da da ....
Now I want to say something, I hope you never will forget.
Wherever you are and whereever I may be.
As lost as I may seem, as cold as it may get.
As old as we may be, I hope you never will forget.
That you are my spark.
That you are my spark.
That you are my spark.
Yeah you are.
Yeah you are.
You are my spark.
Yeah you are.
Yeah you are my spark.
