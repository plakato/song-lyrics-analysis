Art Of Rap Freestyle Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

It's the return of monotonous hotness.
I rock this, you watch this.
Regardless, we got this.
From Hollis, and y'all gets no chances.
No wins and no ends, I need no dances.
No rims or no benz.
From the corners of Hollis Ave.
I came up, blew the game up.
Trying to tell me my reign's up.
Bring my name up, Rev Run, y'all.
