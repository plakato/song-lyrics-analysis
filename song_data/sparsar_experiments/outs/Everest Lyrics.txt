Everest Lyrics
by Wrathschild.


Oh I'mma make it to the top for you 
Till my heart and my hands are blue 
 Gon na climb till you're mine, 
 Gon na get to you, 
 
Shocked me with your touch 
Now. I don't wan na wait another day. No, no 
I've never felt so much 
There's. No chance. I could let this slip away. 
Woah-Ohh ohh, 
 
If. We could get it on tonight. 
If we could become one life. 
 
I would jump off Mount Everest. 
I would scream at top of my lungs 
I would do just about anything 
Just to get inside of your arms 
 
Drop 
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, 
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, 
 
I'll lay you down in my bed 
Recharge. You love you back to life 
Walk all the way to Tibet. 
To greet you catch you from the sky. 
This is my only vision, 
Going on a mission, even if it's the last one of my life, 
 
Oh I'mma, make it to the top for you 
Till my heart and my hands are blue 
 Gon na climb till you're mine, 
 Gon na get to you 
Oh I'mma make it to the top for you, 
Till, my heart and my hands are blue. 
I will die soon, as I get to touching you. 
 
Wait 
 
Drop
