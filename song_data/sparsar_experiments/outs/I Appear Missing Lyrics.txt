I Appear Missing Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


Calling all comas.
Prisoner on the loose.
Description:.
The spitting image of me.
Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out.

Shock me awake.
Tear me apart.
Pinned like a note inside a hospital gown.
A prison of sleep.
Deeper down.
The rabbit hole never to be found.
Again.

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone.
Feelings, raw and exposed.
When I'm out of control.

Pieces were stolen from me.
Or dare I say, given away.
Watching the water give in.
As I go down the drain.
I appear missing now.

I go missing.
No longer exist.
One day, I hope.
I'm someone you'd miss.

It's only falling in love.
Because you hit the ground.

Dancing on the wire both ends are on fire.
Cut me loose.
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend.
Wandering along the road in the summer night.

Don't cry.
With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view.
Inside.
I never loved anything until I loved you.
Confide.
I'm over the edge, what can I do.
But shine? x2.

I've fallen through.
