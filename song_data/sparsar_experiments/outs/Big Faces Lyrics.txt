Big Faces Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.


Flo straight from pluto 
Rings, coming from saturn 
On, my Lewis Milestone nigga, I'm Up And At Em 
Swagg on 300, all the way down to my atoms. 
Next years J's Mike ain't even know that I had em 
Black Flag out my back pocket 
CFSG Ghost Tee 
Pimping wit, precision all the way down to my goatee 
Rock perrias and pop perion, 
On top wit. No cherry on 
Mouth busy spitting fire got time to talk to y'all nary homes, 
Conversate wit, Big Faces Little ones. We can't talk no more 
If. I see ya girl. Take her off the floor. 
If I break her back. She can't walk no more 
And thats all fasho get her girl. When I'm off the show 
 Got ta get to the paper bird flipped to haters 
Make a hit drop, the faders, then I'm out the door 
Boss Shit on G. I ain't got ta talk, shit 
Niggas said I'd be on and off then they heard the tape.
