All The Money Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


I got all the fuckin' money in the world right now: 
So, I'm all up on yo girl right now, 
All this fuckin' money, don't know how to spend it 
Fuck it my team winnin'. So I throw a couple: millions 
 
X2 
Said, that Maybach I'm in it 
Credit card no limit; 
Bad bitches be grinnin' 
Fuck yo ho we winnin' 
 
Rolex on my wrist 40 on my hip 
50 round, my neck 60 hoes on my dick 
We all got Benz. You ain't fuckin' with my clique, 
 
12, our flights, so you know I'm takin' trips 
Rich forever, like I ain't, never goin' broke 
Billion dollar bitch that you'll never get to know 
Came from nothin' straigt up out the O, 
 
Million. On my mind, man. You know this kid go 
Maybach, I'm in it. You could call that livin' 
Credit card no limit. I just bought out True Religion. 
My whole team winnin'. So you know we all on 
Just bought a whole street. My money still on 
 
Bought, a new gave the keys to moms 
G5 jets, takin' trips to Mars, 
What I'mma do with all these cars 
I, don't know I'm on one 
 
Get money on deck 
B-bitch, I'm only 21 
You better ask about me! 
Don'T fuck, with too many fake, hoes 
So bitch get the fuck from'round me 
 
I parked the all black Phantom at the all white Mansion, 
Your hoes stay be active 
All them hoes is ratchet 
Fuck the law enforcement 
I'm. Looking for endorcement 
 
Brand new Lamborghini bitch. I'M ridin' in them horses 
Money talk to the ceiling. Your must have a shortage. 
Shoes $ 1500 and yo ass can't afford it 
 
I'm, always countin' money said I always got a profit. 
If I ever went broke I'd, be runnin' through your pockets. 
I'M a millionaire. You could call me a rich kid: 
Buy new whip every month cos bitch, I'm on my rich shit 
Girl. You cannot fuck with me unless you is a rich chick 
I'm on my Dave, Chapelle shit, 
I'm, rich bitch, 
,
