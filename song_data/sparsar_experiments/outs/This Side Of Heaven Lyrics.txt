This Side Of Heaven Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Four years old, dressed up like a super hero.
Always smiling, never showing he ain't well.
His mom and daddy held his hand through all the chemo.
And sometimes this side of heaven is hell.

Sara Rollins, she left home right out of high school.
Felt the call to serve the day those towers fell.
She came back home today underneath the flag.
And a twenty-one gun salute.
Sometimes this side of heaven is hell.

Somewhere right now a thousand tears are falling.
Somewhere right now a heart's all out of break.
Sometimes it feels like God don't hear us calling out for help.
Sometimes this side of heaven is hell.

Young couple laugh and cry and celebrate.
Two little pink lines showed up clear as a bell.
But their world crashed down.
When the ultrasound found no heartbeat.
Sometimes this side of heaven is hell.

Somewhere right now a thousand tears are falling.
Somewhere right now a heart's all out of break.
Sometimes it feels like God don't hear us calling out for help.
Sometimes this side of heaven is hell.

Sometimes this side of heaven is hell.

I know that on the other side there's healing.
Jesus said there ain't no sorrow up there.
But sometimes it takes all I've got to hold onto the promise.
That only this side of heaven is hell.

Somewhere right now bells and tears are falling.
Somewhere right now a heart's all out of break.
Sometimes it feels like God don't hear us calling out for help.
Sometimes this side of heaven is hell.

But only this side of heaven is hell.
