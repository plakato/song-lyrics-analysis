Mr. Deadhead Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Brainless and narrow minded, a blockhead all the way.
Prejudice's your religion, your maxim's to betray.
Evil and overbearing, stupid cupidity.
A mean and rotten racist, your fall is what I foresee.

Tunes of hate, dirty lies and prate.
Envy is poisoning your soul.
Evil blood, you try to hatch a plot.
But you'll never reach your goal.

Mr. Deadhead, venomous toad.
Mr. Deadhead, your soul will rot.
Mr. Deadhead, habitual liar.
Mr. Deadhead, hate's your desire.

A slave to evilness, you'll face the truth.
No more venom-lies, you will pay your dues.
Hatred ate your heart, tearing your soul apart.
The devil veils your soul with eternal dark.

Tunes of hate, dirty lies and prate.
Envy is poisoning your soul.
Evil blood, you try to hatch a plot.
But you'll never reach your goal.

Mr. Deadhead, venomous toad.
Mr. Deadhead, your soul will rot.
Mr. Deadhead, habitual liar.
Mr. Deadhead, hate's your desire.

Brainless and narrow minded, a blockhead all the way.
Prejudice's your religion, your maxim's to betray.
Evil and overbearing, stupid cupidity.
A mean and rotten racist, your fall is what I foresee.

Tunes of hate, dirty lies and prate.
Envy is poisoning your soul.
Evil blood, you try to hatch a plot.
But you'll never reach your goal.

Mr. Deadhead, venomous toad.
Mr. Deadhead, your soul will rot.
Mr. Deadhead, habitual liar.
Mr. Deadhead, hate's your desire.
