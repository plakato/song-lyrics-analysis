Stranger Blues Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

I'm a stranger here, just blowed in your town.
I'm a stranger here, just blowed in your town.
Just because I'm a stranger everybody wants to dog me around.
Lord, I wonder do my good gal know I'm here?
Lord, wonder do my good gal know I'm here.
Well, if she do she sure don't seem to care.
I wonder how can some people dog a poor stranger so.
I wonder how can some people dog a poor stranger so.
They should remember they gonna reap what they sow.
I would stay up North but there's nothing here that I can do.
I would stay up North but there's nothing here that I can do.
But hang around this corner and sing the poor stranger blues.
Mama, I am going back south if I wear ninety nine pair of shoes.
Mama, I am going back south if I wear ninety nine pair of shoes.
Then I know I'll be welcome and I won't have the stranger's blues.
