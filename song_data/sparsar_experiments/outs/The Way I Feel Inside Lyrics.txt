The Way I Feel Inside Lyrics
by The Zombies.

Should I try to hide.
The way I feel inside.
My heart, for you?

Would you say that you.
Would try to love me too?
In your mind.
Could you ever be.
Really close to me?
I can tell the way you smile.
If I feel that I.
Could be certain, then.
I would say the things.
I want to say tonight.

But 'til I can see.
That you'd really care for me.
I will dream.
That someday you'll be.
Really close to me.
I can tell the way you smile.
If I feel that I.
Could be certain, then.
I would say the things.
I want to say tonight.

But 'til I can see.
That you'd really care for me.
I'll keep trying to hide.
The way I feel inside.
