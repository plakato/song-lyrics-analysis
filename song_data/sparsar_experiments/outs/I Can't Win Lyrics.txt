I Can't Win Lyrics
by 51.50.


The green and white 
Is on my back 
Trying to bring me down 
 
Phone rings: 3x 
 
Hey 
Pacific Bell with a called call from 
B-M-F-D 
Yeah. I do 
Except the phone call, 
Homeboy, 
 
I, take a look true. My book 
And, the days of a crook 
Shit I took 
And, I cooked 
And, a cop got shocked, 
Wasn't fine with a group 
Call 7-9 
Come. True the town 
7-9 
Wasn't hard to find 
Put. My foot up in the pen 
I had to stack my bank 
Ben Frank's 
Everyday 
Of, this cocaine base 
And. I would 
Die for this 
Cause. I 
Strike for this 
Try to take my gat 
And. Then my 
Nine gon na speak 
Cause. You should know I served time. 
And, it's going to paid-me 
But, the old G's told us niggas to just keep on stepping 
Cause these bustas 
Suckers 
Is coming to bust us 
So, put some muscle in your hustle 
And just row with the punches 
And. Since that day, 
I began 
To pack, a mutha- 
Fucking gun 
We weren't, not sleeping 
When. I was about my scratch. 
I had to had that fat sack 
To, make my pockets fat 
Remember, all them late nights, 
Remember all them hood rat, bitches 
On, my muthafucking dick 
Cause. I had these riches 
Put the cops on my jock 
Cause. I'M slangging rocks 
On the block 
Hella high thinking. I can't be stop 
But. These bustas 
Suckas 
Kinda, shady 
Maybe 
Trying. To pay me 
Fade me 
Tip the cops off 
To, where I get my rocks at 
God. Tham 
I can't win 
Now, I'm locked up in this 
Muthafucking pen, 
 
Dial Tone, ...
