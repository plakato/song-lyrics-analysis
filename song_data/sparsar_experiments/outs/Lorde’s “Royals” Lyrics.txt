Lorde’s “Royals” Lyrics
by ​xKylan.

Produced by Joel Little.

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh.
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies.
And I'm not proud of my address.
In the torn up town, no post code envy.

But every song's like, gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom.
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room.
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams.
But everybody's like, Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair.

And we'll never be royals.
It don't run in our blood.
That kind of luxe just ain't for us.
We crave a different kind of buzz.
Let me be your ruler , you can call me Queen Bee.
And baby I'll rule.
Let me live that fantasy.

My friends and I we've cracked the code.
We count our dollars on the train to the party.
And everyone who knows us knows.
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money.

We're bigger than we ever dreamed.
And I'm in love with being queen.

Life is great, without a care.
We aren't caught up in your love affair.
