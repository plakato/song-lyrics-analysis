Les Os Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

Tell me about your love affairs.
Tell me about your moral resignation.
Oh, uh-oh, oh oh oh oh.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

Tell me about your love affairs.
I want to know all the lurid details.
Oh oh oh uh-oh.
Oh oh oh uh-oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh.
Uh-oh uh-oh.

I want to die today.
And make love with you in my grave.
I want to die today.
And make love with you in my grave.
All day.
All day.

Is this love of ours a lie?
Is it killing me alive?
Is this love of ours a lie?
Is it chemically derived to ascertain.
And sequester the pain?
Is this love of ours a lie?
