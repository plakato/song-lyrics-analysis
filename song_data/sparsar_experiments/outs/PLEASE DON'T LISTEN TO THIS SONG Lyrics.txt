Thought, I Told You Not To Play This ... 
 
Rah, Rah,

You. Don'T Listen! Do Ya! 
 
OooYeah,

Worked, up 
Pretty girls, getting on my nerves, I'm nervous, 
She, talkin' bout diamonds in the cross. That'S the type of shit she worship! 
Oooyeah! 
Hey! Can I give it to ya? 
She saw diamonds in my Jesus 
Then. She screamed out Hallelujah 
 
Amen 
 
Woke up feeling, like the man Awesome 
Riding through my city, like I'm, taking on Gotham 
But. Where are all the bad guys, man, I think I lost â€˜em. 
All, I see is bad girls, ... 
What's wrong wit, that Nothing 
But. I don't want love 
Cuz. I can't afford it 
Threw up the roc 
Jus', because I'm nauseous 
You seen that body 
That shit is Gorgeous. 
They said, please be cautious. 
I said FUCK THAT CALL MY LAWYERS 
 
I'm, the man 
 
Naw, you don't understand 
 
Oh yea. We in the house, 
 
So. I need you right now: 
 
Cuz Baby, I'm the man, 
Suicide Doors You Can Fly or Drive 
All, I'm Looking For Is A Ride or Die 
Hey Baby Over There Yo Am I Your Type 
Cuz. All The Girls Say: I'm Pretty Fly For A Black Guy 
 
When. The liquor hits the system 
Ain't no for seein' 
Who I'ma be in 
Who feeling freaky 
She, maybe Black White or half European 
If ya. Don'T like that. Did I ask your opinion 
I'm stupid stupid. I'M swerving crazy 
Jus' give it up. I deserve it. Baby 
I got Vitamin D. Yea ya heard me baby 
Oh. You say you been a bit malnourished. Lately: 
 
Well-Well 
Well, I'm the man 
Naw, you don't understand, 
Ay all my Players in the house 
So. I need you right now: 
Cuz Baby, I'm the man, 
 
Suicide Doors You Can Fly or Drive 
All, I'm Looking For Is A Ride or Die 
Hey Baby Over There Yo Am I Your Type 
Cuz. All The Girls Say: I'm Pretty Fly For A Black Guy 
 
As. Soon, as this came on, the girls started going off. 
But. If you ain't show it all, then you ain't showing off 
I. Need you real bad, like my dick going soft 
PLEASE DO N'T! Listen TO THIS SONG 
Cuz this ain't. What you want:
