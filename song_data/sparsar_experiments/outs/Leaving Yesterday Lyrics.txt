Leaving Yesterday Lyrics
by Wolverine.

The truth in your eyes promised me.
A life far away from yesterday.
In you I see the future....
In our special place we will build our own dream.

You're the moon in my deep blue sky.
Through the darkest of nights.
Your light spreads across my land.
On my fields we'll stand hand in hand.

Oh, so we are both night and day.
We'll watch the winter snow unite with the summer rain.
During times of our yesterday we will find a way to look ahead.
Through the darkness, our past darkness, we will stand hand in hand.
And we'll be there together as one....

Come with me and leave the rain behind, I will carry you.
Sheltered by our love we'll leave yesterday.

Time won't exist as we're heading for an eternity.
Flying through the unknown skies painted in the beauty of you and I....

Breathing a pleasant silence tonight.
The sound of your breath carries the light.
You're what I was put here for.
And finally I know just how to smile.

You're the moon in my deep blue sky.
Through the darkest of nights.
Your light spreads across my land.
On my fields we'll stand hand in hand.
Our love will be our lifelong map.
And our road will lead us to eternity....

Come with me and leave the rain behind, I will carry you.
Sheltered by our love we'll leave yesterday.
