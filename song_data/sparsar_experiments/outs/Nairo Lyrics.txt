Nairo Lyrics
by Uneek.


I said yeah, I'm from Nairo 
AKA, the 2-5-4 
Light one up light one up, 
For, all the rasta that I know 
 
I said yeah, I'm from Nairo 
Where you get rich or you die, broke. 
I said yeah: that's that Nairo 
Where you get rich or you die, broke 
Where, it's all about survival. 
Where the cops carry those rifles. 
Bob Marley's, our idol, 
This for all the niggas I'd die fo' 
Big up to all my hustlers in Kibich 
My Somalies in Isich. 
Blue, Moon, I'm sipping 
With a light skin, I'm pimping 
Shashamani, I'm tripping Shashamani, I'm tripping 
This for 46 Ungwaro, 34, East Lando, 
 
I, said yeah, I'm from Nairo 
Where you get rich or you die, broke. 
I said yeah: that's that Nairo 
Where you get rich or you die, broke 
Chewing goks, I'm idle, 
This fo', the bad gals that I know 
All I know, is hustle hustle get my doe 
All, I know, is hustle hustle get my doe 
R.I.P., my homie E-Sir 
Rest. In peace, but we miss ya 
Free Kartel, the Teacher 
I'm trying to be a president, call me Peter 
I'm, wearing gold chains. I'M Sonko 
My clothes, clean, Omo, 
Got, a gal in Westie. That'S sexy, 
I went through her legs. Chobo 
 
No sun will shine in my day today. 
The high, yellow moon won't come out to play. 
Darkness has covered my light. 
And has turned my day to night 
Where. Is this love to be found?
