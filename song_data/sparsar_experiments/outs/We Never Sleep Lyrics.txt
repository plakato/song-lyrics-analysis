We Never Sleep Lyrics
by UNIFIED GIANTS.

“We, Never Sleep” by Unified Giants, 
 
Once again, once again, my friend 
Once again 
Once again 
Once again once again, my friend 
 
I, hustle 24 hours… Single rotation, 
Planetary knowledge…, rhyme occupation 
All through the night on the World Wide Web 
Having people take a listen to The words I said: 
I'm all-good, like a Nun in the bed, 
Shon-Son pedigree, bred 
Digitize. So now I realize to 
Emphasize the meaning of world wide, so 
Many women recognize 
Recognize her pictures online rubbing her thighs 
And. Then I surf like I'm Malibu born 
So many topics. Most of it, the norm, 
Like, iTunes and days on E-trade, 
I, see your twitter hate homie, you a spam bot, 
I'm saying stop and that really ain't a diss 
Cause. If you want to win you really wouldn't trip 
 
While you sleep, 
Money, never sleeps, 
At night. It never ever sleeps 
While you, sleep, 
Money, never sleeps 
Never, ever not even one blink 
 
Cause, some where in the world its day time, 
And people grind to the light of the sunshine 
While you sleep, 
Money, never sleeps, 
At night, it never ever sleeps 
Come on 
 
Its late night and all of us grinding 
Yes, sir, and now I'm back rhyming 
Getting money's, not a choice, 
Not, a choice and if it is 
Then celebrate the joy 
But, many ladders might need a lot of climbing 
And. So I'm on it I'll see you at the top 
And every song come fresh served hot 
Cooked, slow on the low like a crock pot, 
Little rice, little bread, everybody fed 
On the spot with a grape soda pop. Now 
Us people pushing the product that people love 
Former thugs, selling digital drugs 
Not by the gram. When I'm sot of like Pfizer, 
Incorporated trained rap writer, 
Gold finders used to them all nighters 
The sleepwalkers… 
Bona fide rhymers 
 
While, you sleep, 
Money, never sleeps, 
At night. It never ever sleeps 
While you, sleep, 
Money, never sleeps 
Never, ever not even one blink 
 
Cause, some where in the world its day time, 
And people grind to the light of the sunshine 
While you sleep, 
Money, never sleeps, 
At night, it never ever sleeps 
Come on 
 
Once again, once again my friend 
Once again 
Once again 
Once again once again, my friend
