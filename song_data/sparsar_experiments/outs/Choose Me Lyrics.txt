C'mon baby. Give it to me girl 
You should get to know me, but first you got ta. Show me

I ain't come up in this club. Looking for love, 
I ain't come up in this club l-l-l-lookin for love, 
I'm such a leader, not a follower. 
I know how to do my own thing: 
Fall off in the spot, dirty d, woth, the home, ting 
Rip. The qwip, though, say your own thing: 
MJs wak to criminal with the chrome thing 
I'm on a grown man, I'm never outta place 
Ask about my swagg, oh yeah. It'S outer space 
You'll go by the bar joc by the whole place. 
You buy it, buy the bottle. I'Ll pop the whole case, 
Posted on the sofa blowing fat, spilfs 
Linix small tags, I shop at sex, spil, 
Hard em up the k, christian artisha 
Your bitch, keep watchin me she thinkin 
What. She ought to say 
I'll leave her speechless. Had your girl 
I can tell she freaky and just don't know how to tell joc 
I got ta leak and vicky secrets on flash floods. 
I just need some good lovin. I ain't lookin for love. 
I ain't come up in this club. Looking for love, 
I ain't come up in this club l-l-l-lookin for love. 
I ain't come up in this club. Looking for love, 
I ain't come up in this club. L-L-L-Lookin for love. 
You chose me, 
You chose me 
And, I chose ya 
And I chose ya. 
You chose me: 
You chose me 
And. I chose ya 
Yeah yeaah ..., 
I ain't come up in this club. Looking for love, 
I ain't come up in this club l-l-l-lookin for love. 
I ain't come up in this club. Looking for love, 
I ain't come up in this club l-l-l-lookin for love
