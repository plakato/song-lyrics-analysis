I Belong Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

It's hard to say the time and place that I knew.
It got hard to think of anything else but me and you.
Yeah, some may take for granted, oh, but I could not imagine.

How the world still spins when the door opens.
And you walk into the room.
When you're near, there's a sound, there's a sense I can feel.
Something I can't explain but it's real, yeah, it's real.

From the time I'm waking through the days I'm facing.
Till the sleep I'm faking, I belong with you.
Till the stars start falling, till the wind stops calling.
Till they lose their moment, I belong, I belong with you.

From the bells that ring when we can never knew.
To the park and lovers our eyes lock and the stories all comes true.
I'm aware, yeah, sparks fly by through the air.
And the night lights up everywhere cause you're there.

From the time I'm waking through the days I'm facing.
Till the sleep I'm faking, I belong with you.
Till the stars start falling, till the wind stops calling.
Till they lose their moment, I belong, I belong with you.
I belong with you.

Everything I do just reminds me again.
Like a picture of you painted under my skin.
If love is a mystery then my only clue is.
Some belong together like I do to you.

From the time I'm waking through the days I'm facing.
Till the sleep I'm faking, I belong with you.
Till the stars start falling, till the wind stops calling.
Till they lose their moment, I belong, I belong with you.

I belong with you.
Oh, I belong, I belong with you.
