We Murderers Baby Lyrics
by Vita.


Yo, 
Da Murderers, 
I.N.C., 
Vita Ja, Rule 
, 
I, be running and gunning them down. 
Leave me or love me now: 
Anywhere, anyhow 
You and I together and we blast forever: 
 { 2x }, 
 
Ja's the dream and nigga's wake up and sweats its about 
Horse head in your bed. Nigga 
Gun your mouth 
Potty it out, 
Wrong nigga, 
Spit, one more thang and have your hood pouring out liqour 
Cause, my niggas run through lesbians 
Niggas that act like brawds 
Feel the strip and thus be gone 
Hold up. Nigga that done spread up. 
You might wan na keep in touch with the murderers 
Cause. We, the murderers, I.N.C 
Is above yall niggas, it's the lord in me, 
And. We can never be at a love's lost 
But. You showed me: love ain't boss, 
Feel the force 
This young horse 
Known as rule 
Gave more paper to jigga. For my ewls 
And. Lord knows ain't no pussy going to stop my flow 
I! Don'T love! You hoes! I'M out the door! 
 
You that motherfucking bitch Vita nigga 
You want me to ryde you nigga 
Clap up and hide you nigga 
Been beside my niggas for this long 
I'm keeping my head right and tight and doe long 
I can go on about shit. I'Ve been through 
Transponed keys are in too 
Shit. I got issues 
If. I pop a bitch 
Then. She probably a snitch 
L-A-V-I-T-A-A-A-K-A Taday Vallet shit 
When, my niggas from my bitches 
Sold drugs from niggas to the murderes 
I'm, the bitch. Sometimes I even spit on chicks 
Cause. In the clubs I sip Crys' and I piss the shit baby 
I know your brawds been feeling me lately now livin and lay 
Cause. I touch them with gun. Blades dark is us 
Any light shine. We bust 
Vita, Gotti and Rule. We make up the murderers, 
 
The reasons why I pop between the lie. 
Be, the same reasons I clap off the nines 
Roll up on bronx, like who da hot bitch 
And stock, with some sweats humpin out on sixth 
 
That's. It go head baby, floss out, bitches 
But me. I'M continue to clap, niggas, 
Strike and heavy hitters that play the field reveal 
Pull that weapon and re-keep the seal, 
 
It's murder to the end 
Only Jesus Christ made us a strong sacrifice. 
These niggas I die for lies to the fed form 
Set out these bitch niggas. I pick them in bad form: 
 
Baby, I'm long gone, but I'm loyal 
For, the love that you show your bitches 
And spread to your thugs 
And. They tongue kiss slugs 
When the fucking wit us 
You, crazy. That'S why
