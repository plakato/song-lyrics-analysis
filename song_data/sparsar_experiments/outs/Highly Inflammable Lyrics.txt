Highly Inflammable Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

Highly inflammable.
Neurotic tensions.
Waiting to explode.
I thought you were a man.
You thought I was a woman.
Risen overflowed.
But I was Tinkerbell.
And you were Peter Pan.
It ain't hip if you are retro.
Influenced by the fashion pages.
Influenced by other's phrases.
You're a pseudo quasi intellectual.
Supreme equality.
We used to compete.
The right to decide.
Is denied to the sheep.
I thought you were a man.
You thought I was a woman.
But I was Tinkerbell.
And you were Peter Pan.
