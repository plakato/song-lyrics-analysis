Living Life Lyrics
by ViZion.


Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit.
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit.
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit.
Feeling lit, feeling light, 2am, summer night.

Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.

On the go, on the go.
From the club and we're going home.
In the zone, summer zone.
In a Rizzla, put the Kush and roll.
Two in the back and one in the passenger.
We're switching lanes and passing ya.
In the ride, smoke is lavender.
And we're getting wilder than Africa.
My head is spinning, I do this on occasion.
'Specially when bad bitches got this whip hotter than cajun.
Gripping on my set, she said she never had a Bajan.
Kissing on my neck, she knows I rise to the occasion.

We're living life.
This is our generation.
We touch the sky.
And don't care what they're saying.
Living life.
So fuck the situation.
Just for the night.
It's Californication.

Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.

I'm here to party, I'm here to party.
Who's got the flint? I've got the Marley.
Who's got the drink? where is the Barbie?
I touch her button an' make her rev like a Harley.
Up in the rpms, it's crazy.
Pass the buds, sips the suds.
Tomorrow this all will be hazy.
I love the rush though, I'm living up.
And we're miles high, picture painted like tie die.
Superfaded, yea why lie?
We connected like wifi.
I wet her up like a drive by.
Wild nights, that's how we're rolling.
I'm miles high, thats how we're zoning.
You blink twice, it might over.
So save the moment bitch.

We're living life.
This is our generation.
We touch the sky.
And don't care what they're saying.
Living life.
So fuck the situation.
Just for the night.
It's Californication.

Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.
Uh uh, fuck that.
Hands on the wheel.

We're living life.
This is our generation.
We touch the sky.
And don't care what they're saying.
Living life.
So fuck the situation.
Just for the night.
It's Californication.
