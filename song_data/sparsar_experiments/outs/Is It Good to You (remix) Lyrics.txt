Is It Good to You (remix) Lyrics
by Yummy Bingham.

It's a shame that it took so long for me to give it to ya baby.
I take the blame cause I wanted to make it worth something good for ya baby.
Now that you got it tell me did it drive you crazy make you wanna have a baby.
ooo did it make you wanna pay me.

I wanna know.
How much can you take?
Did you have enough?
Do you want me to break you off again and again?
Should I keep on goin till I say you win?
O is it good to you.
Tell me is it great to you.
Time is precious and it can't wait.
Tell me something before it's too late.

You understand that I only question for the fun of testing you.
Or to see what more I could do.
I secure I'm very sure that what I'm giving is more than enough.
It's more than that gushy stuff.
It's that that make you wanna get rough it's that that make a nigga get buff.
At the end of the day all I really care is how muchâ€¦

You can put it in ya hand you can taste it in ya mouth just so good it could.
turn a brotha out make you give ya roll when you try to hold out baby you.
can't help but to want me go ahead take advantage of the wealth believe me.
this is good for ya health and you got it all for yourself could you ask for.
anything else nooooo.
