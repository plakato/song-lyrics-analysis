Hikikomori Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

Blisters on my hands.
Cannot feel the doors or floors.
I got cysts, yeah, in my head.
Telling to me to take a blow.
Telling me to let it fade.

Sicker in the daytime.
Safer on the inside.

Oh, I know I'm home.
Oh, I know I'm home.

Fingers in the air.
Grabbing before they swallow.
Lingering by the stairs.
Doubt I won't follow.

Oh, I know I'm home.
Oh, I know I'm home.

Sicker in the daytime.
Safer on the inside.

Oh, I know, I'm home.

Keeps me awake now.
Keeps me restless.
Fools lust from the outer.
Moving faster.

Oh, I know I'm home.
Oh, I know I'm home.

Sicker in the daytime.
Safer on the inside.

Oh, I know I'm home.
