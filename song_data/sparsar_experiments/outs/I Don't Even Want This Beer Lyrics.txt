I Don't Even Want This Beer Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Been on this binge for way too long.
Ain't been sober since you've been gone.
They say this time I'm in too deep.
There's a man in the mirror but it ain't me.

Here I am getting tore up on a Tuesday.
Sittin' here lettin' her get to me.
Tryin' to make the pain and another one disappear.
I oughta be dialin' up her number.
Sayin' I'm sorry can I come over.
Makes me wonder what the hell I'm doin' here.
I don't even want this beer.

I wonder if she's alone tonight.
Thinkin' bout all I didn't do right.
Or is she out on the town in my favorite dress.
With some ole boy tryin' his best.
To get her buzzin' just enough that she might say yes.

And here I am getting tore up on a Tuesday.
Sittin' here lettin' her get to me.
Tryin' to make the pain and another one disappear.
I oughta be dialin' up her number.
Sayin' I'm sorry can I come over.
Makes me wonder what the hell I'm doin' here.

I don't even want this beer.
Don't want this high.
All I want is you tonight.

Here I am getting tore up on a Tuesday.
Sittin' here lettin' her get to me.
Tryin' to make the pain and another one disappear.
I oughta be dialin' up her number.
Sayin' I'm sorry can I come over.
Makes me wonder what the hell I'm doin' here.
I don't even want this beer.
I don't even want this beer.
