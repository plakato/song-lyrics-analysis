Black and White Lyrics
by Wretch 32.

Fasten your seatbelt, I'm about to take you on a journey.
On par with your dream world.
A master at retail, cause I'll be enterin' the charts with.
A half of my pre-sales.
A bastard that means well, cause everything I touch breaks.
I should sign me a sweet girl, fly me an email.
And give your life to the game that's, the minor of details.

Give your life to the game the most.
The minor of details.
Give your life to the game.
So why would I be vex.
I made it out of the hex.
While nuff man got murked I came out.
In a Benz, and yet I'm still on the ends.
With not one new friend.
My whole circles in shape.
We came first to the race.
I came second on my second attempt.
It was well worth the wait like.

Every word every tape.
Every person that ate I.
Still got the same hunger.
So I work every day why?
The closer I get now the further.
My break time.
Being safe ain't safe.
But the combinations still the same.
You do you and everybody commentates.
On your game, that's just the way it plays.
But I remember bein' eight, thinkin' how do I get a chain.
Now I gave mine away, because the goals got to change.
Or you get caught offside in the crossfire.
Everyone claims that they told, you to wait.
Cause they just wanted you replaced.

Refrain.
The dark side of my life.
Where my heart weren't alive.
The light side of my life.
Where my dreams came to life.
The dark side of my life.
Where my heart weren't alive.
The light side of my life.
Where my dreams came to life.

The reason I never had a heart.
Is because I never had a chance.
Playin' Monopoly thinkin', will I ever get a yard.
Now Mayfair ain't far.
But if I go, then did I really play my role.
I walk around to show hope.
I don't need to showboat.
We all know I've got dough.
Now I want to see my people.
Evolve sho.
It ain't a sprint, it's a marathon.
So I can't piggy back any tag alongs.
If you weren't there when we were.
Four in a Travelodge.
Then you'll only make me laugh.
Carry on.
You know you're your own man.
When you're giving advice to your.
Old man.
You keep the roof over mums head.
Cah you can't put a price on a.
Home fam.
Nevertheless everyone will forever.
Suggest.
That they can invest.
That's intelligent stressI came to rap I.
Don't penny you're cheques.
I just wanna be heard.
I wanna be first.
I don't know it all like them wannabe, nerds.
But I am not the man of the hour.
I'm the man with the power.
Cah I just put my sun on the Earth, word.

Refrain x2.
