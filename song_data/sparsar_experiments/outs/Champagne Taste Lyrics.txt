Champagne Taste Lyrics
by Univore.


Oh, no!
I shouldn't be driving this car!

I was drinking champagne on Lake Shore drive, 89 miles per hour.
A smooth road, wearing a tuxedo, very sharp.
There was a party at a hotel, downtown Chicago.
This is my town.
I should not be driving this car.

It's the champagne taste.
The champagne taste.
It's the champagne taste.
The champagne taste.

Flashing red lights. I pulled the kerb.
License and registration, sobriety check....
There is a crack rock in my throat.
I will be the best-dressed man in prison!
I should not be driving this car.

It's the champagne taste.
The champagne taste.
It's the champagne taste.
The champagne taste.

Now, I'm in a cab. I call my babe.
She tells me, Be cool..
My baby comes, she say, Let's go. Take the tuxedo off.
Let your thoughts flies away.
I should've had that car drove....

It's the champagne taste.
The champagne taste.
It's the champagne taste.
The champagne taste.
