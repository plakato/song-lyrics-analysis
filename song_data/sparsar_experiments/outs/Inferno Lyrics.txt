Inferno Lyrics
by Voli.


This is war 
And, the enemy is at my door, 
Light the torch 
Let, the fire burn through your core 
 
So. Tell me: why tell me why 
Love don't last and the good die young 
They sell, you lies they sell. You lies 
I fear that the fire will turn to dust 
 
So. Do I dance with the devil 
And make all my dreams come true. 
Do, I dance with the devil 
Do. I burn myself for you. 
Inferno inferno, Inferno, 
, 
Dark angel, Bipolar, 
Strong, halo, God Flower. I was sent from the 80's 
All black leather black denim black Avi's 
Took, the DeLorean to the future. How pathetic 
Cuz some reason fellas in the present, don't get it 
Way ahead of my time you later better rewind 
This message is for the haters relay. It get a baton. 
Here Here Voli Nouveau, Yah, 
Best shit, you neva hearda, and I kill it. It'S a murder. 
And, I kill off any juror, no judge no verdict. 
Man Voli got bars only right for me to serve'em 
Quarter-life irony. We die for the dollar 
I'm sumthin, like Obama, make change, I'm a wallet 
Created. My own genre little bit of Kanye 
Little, bit of Sting with a little Bob Marley 
Add a little Nas Daft Punk, Big Punisher 
 Got ta, be the shit when these labels can't stomach ya 
Said, I'm too damn retro too damn electro 
But. Only doin' rap was just too damn simple 
Dance, with the devil No. Sex with a goddess 
I'm on another level. Lem me step it up. An octave 
Higher higher higher Inferno set me on fire 
The. Only thing that burn is my motherfuckin' desire, 
 
Oh man on fire,
