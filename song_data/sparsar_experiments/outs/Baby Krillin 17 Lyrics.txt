Baby Krillin 17 Lyrics
by Black Kray.


I think I'm Krillin smoking kush.
I'm chilling with Vegeta selling White.
We be thugging up on Planet Namek.
I'm with my best friend Gohan we gon shine.

Gohan, you're my best friend.
I do not want you to die.
Promise I'll protect you.
Shoot that nigga Frieza with the tec for you.
Fly, fly, we gon fly away.
Sellin white with Vegeta, man.
Got my wrist twerking, going ham.
With my superpowers like I'm Super Sayian.
Kush packs on young Piccolo.
With Gohan he'll gon help me roll.
Hit a lick on Android 17.
Ran up on him with a power beam.
And I heard Cell sucks at sex.
Ran up on him with that fire heat.
Now we back on Planet 17.
Call me young Krillin cause I'm 17.
