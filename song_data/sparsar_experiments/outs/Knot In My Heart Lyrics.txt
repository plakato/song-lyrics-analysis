Knot In My Heart Lyrics
by The Zolas.

My friends are wilding.
How winter loves wear thin.
They're cut to kindling.
When summer hits our skin.

We're like a seedling.
Suck tears out of a vase.
A forest fire knows.
Something will take its place.

So why do I need.
Something more.
You've got that secret knock to my door.

I wake up some days with a knot in my heart.
Where oh where, where are you?
It's hard and weird not to know how your day begins.
Though I'm lying next to someone new.

Calm and collected.
I'm feeling nothing in the world can shake my bones.
These new distractions like growing grasses.
Hide the path between our homes.
