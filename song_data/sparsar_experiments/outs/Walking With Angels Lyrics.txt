Walking With Angels Lyrics
by Swing Dee Diablo.

2X I'll always be here cause I love you.

First Verse.

I wonder why god took away your wings.
I'm glad you're here but you belong in heaven.
Where the angels sing.
Even your friends are fine.
It's almost like you're walking with angels.
I guess what I'm saying is you're a goddess.
Without the halo.
Your bodies like a Picasso.
But to me you're living art.
Make love to your insides.
U laugh cause i tickle your heart.
You want me then i'm on my way.
All you gotta do is holla.
The way you look in them jeans.
Your ass is worth a million dollars.
Our relationship died but now it's been resurrected.
I got a second chance at love.
So you know i'm gonna respect it.
I feel blessed to be involved in your life.
In your Day to day.
I promise now you got a shoulder to lean on.
In every way.

I knew I loved you the first time I saw you.
There will be no lying to you.
No Pain No Sorrow.
From here on out I Promise.
You don't have to beg or borrow.
All that pain and stress.
Worry about that shit tomorrow.
You're Beautiful,You must be heaven sent.
But you're here so heavens missing an angel then.
A goddess amongst us without the halo.
You're friends are fine.
It's like you're walking with Angels.

Second Verse.

Thinking back to that day.
When we first broke up.
Just thinking about this shit.
Makes me start to break up.
You cried and you said you loved me.
And I just froze up.
Not because I didn't love you.
Because i was cocky as fuck.
But now you're gone.
And I swear you never came back.
I admit I was stupid.
There's No denying the facts.
All i Know is he treats you good.
And you deserve that.
But i'd be lying if I said I didn't want you back.
So I Prayed and I prayed.
Yes I talked to the lord.
And he brought you back to me.
Your life i'll enjoy.
You're the only thing I love more.
Than making these heaters.
And i can't wait to put these fucking rings.
Back on your fingers.
Yeah I'm done playing around.
I swear I'm Done with basic hoes.
You deserve anything you want.
The cars the clothes.
Plus you live inside my music.
You perform at all my shows.
There's angels walking with you i know.

I knew I loved you the first time I saw you.
There will be no lying to you.
No Pain No Sorrow.
From here on out I Promise.
You don't have to beg or borrow.
All that pain and stress.
Worry about that shit tomorrow.
You're Beautiful,You must be heaven sent.
But you're here so heavens missing an angel then.
A goddess amongst us without the halo.
You're friends are fine.
It's like you're walking with Angels.

Third verse.

I Used to think that it would rain.
Every time that I stepped outside.
But now that i see your face again.
You provide that sunshine.
The year that we didn't talk.
Was too damn long.
The whole time I was depressed.
Like that Cool Vee song.
But I always loved the way you looked.
In those tiny thongs.
Or those granny panties.
It didn't matter cause we got along.
Had to grow up a bit.
Now I understand i was wrong.
And I missed you the second.
I realized that you were gone.
I just can't beat it up.
And throw it down like it's donkey kong.
I gotta make sure that we can exist.
That we get along.
Silly Puddy in ya jeans.
Makes me wanna hug ya hips.
Hold your hand make love to you.
I wanna kiss ya lips.
In closing I guess.
All I'm really trying to say.
Is that I that you're heavenly.
An Angel in every way.
And oh yeah.
No more skipping church for a lions game.
I Promise I'm done with the childish games.

I knew I loved you the first time I saw you.
There will be no lying to you.
No Pain No Sorrow.
From here on out I Promise.
You don't have to beg or borrow.
All that pain and stress.
Worry about that shit tomorrow.
You're Beautiful,You must be heaven sent.
But you're here so heavens missing an angel then.
A goddess amongst us without the halo.
You're friends are fine.
It's like you're walking with Angels.
