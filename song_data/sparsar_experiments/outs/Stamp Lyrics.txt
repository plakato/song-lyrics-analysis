Stamp Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Send it off with a stamp.
As the winter locks in the branches above you higher than where we've loved.
It's never coming back.
And the hardest thing about this love is that you're never coming back.

Hold me close while you can.
It's hard to remember the end of December holding onto the past.
You're never coming back.
And the hardest thing about this love is that it's never going to last.
And the hardest thing about this love is that you're never coming back.

And our love's waiting tonight.
And our love's wasted tonight.
And our love's waiting tonight.
And our love's wasted tonight.

Well hold young lovers, you'll.
Find another, Your.
Heart will sing too.
But I don't need you.

Well hold young lovers, you'll.
Find another, your.
Heart will sing too.
But I don't need you.

And hold on lover, you'll.
Find another, but.
I don't need you.
And I won't need to.
