A Very Important Thing To Do Lyrics
by Zooey Deschanel.

Come one, come two, come all.
Everyone heed the call.
There's a very important thing to do!

Drop what you're doing and come.
Bumbadee bumbadee bum.
There's a very important thing to do!

It's time to gather 'round.
The work has just begun.
And when it's done.
Then you'll have found.
That you have had some fun.

With a.
Monumentu-ous.
Consequentu-ous.

Very important thing to do!
