Mackenzie (The Ocean) Lyrics
by Rustlah.

Port the prettiest princess in portland.
Who never dreamed.
The sort who insist ideas.
Important on everything.
The most realistic idealist.
You've ever seen.
You see the scene.
Behind eyes tinted with yellow, green.
A mellow theme.
The most rested, and dresses clean.
You're so restless.
And hate the rain mary jane.
The only thing that replace the pain.
You take the train.
An everyday occurrence.
With no umbrella a purist.
Who doesn't trust the tourist.
And know the earth is just a circus.
He ask you wanna leave this place.
You say ok lets race a way.
This very day and chase a plane.
Whole worlds open and.
The scope of your hopin leaves you.
Unafraid to show emotion when he.
Bring your feet back to the ocean.

You had a dream.
Rather the dream wrapped like sheets.
To your feet, you sleep for weeks.
And for every day you sleep the sleet.
Hammers nails into the streets.
Pillow clouds are shrouds that gather round.
The sun falls down beneath the ground.
You pull your covers, thunder sounds.
This duvet weighs a hundred pounds.
Inside the dream reign normalcy.
Which callously remind you of the fallacy.
In actuality the port twitches.
Back insides the storms intrinsic.
Remember Every Moment before you miss it.
Relay every moment poem it qoute it.
You hear the birds out side the window.
Defer your dream, pixel pane erosion.
As one world closes your eyelids open.
Sand in your toes hands in the ocean.

Now you know this can't be a dream.
You reach for the port on your neck and it seems.
Theres nothing left except his breath.
The air feels right inside your chest.
Your'e ok you're free, life is exactly how you.
Always dreamed that it would be.
The sun rises you dance across the sand.
Abandoned all plans so easily.
But this is peace is only ported.
Assorted portions of of another world.
Where possibilities are enormous.
Brought to you through amorphous.
Cordless orchids and nerves that send.
Your mind a million micro ports of purpose.
But one day you'll have your promised land.
Just take his hand and keep hopin.
The whole world is your ocean.
