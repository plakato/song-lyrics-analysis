Delirium Lyrics
by Zomboy.

Change, racing through my veins.
I feel you from the inside.
Filling up my head with a vision so strange.

I'm free, floating with the stars.
A diamond lost in heaven.
As long as I got you I am high on my heart.

You make me feel so high.
I don't know what i'm doing.
You make me feel so high.
I don't know right from ruin.
You make me feel so high.
I don't know what i'm doing.
You make me feel so high.
I don't know right from ruin.

You make me feel so!

Time, folding on itself.
Moments last forever.
Am I wide awake.
Is it money or spell?

Your touch, is lightning on my skin.
And as were flying higher.
Who can tell the view from the heroin?

You make me feel so high.
I don't know what i'm doing.
You make me feel so high.
I don't know right from ruin.

You make me feel so!
