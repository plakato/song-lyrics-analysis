Starlight Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


Twilight.
Growing in my shadow.
A starless, airy sky.
Intending to imply.
That the sun was dying.
Starlight.
Creeping in my window.
A ghostly lantern's glow.
It tried to let me know.
There was time outside.

Running down, running down.
Running down, running down.
Running down, running down.
Like a river over me.
In starlight.
In starlight.
It surrounds, it surrounds.
It surrounds, it surrounds.
It surrounds, it surrounds.
Even what we can't see.
In starlight.
In starlight.
Not a sound, not a sound.
Not a sound, not a sound.
Not a sound, for it arrives.
Only quietly.

Moonlight.
Raining on my shoulders.
Casting out my fears.
And drawing ever nearer.
To betray its holder.
Dawning.
Peering o'er the mountain.
It scatters darkness' trace.
And all will hide their face.
To behold its glory.

There was time.
Only little was seen.
But we know.
This is strong.
Like the growth of a seed.
It is what's determined.
And has been set forth.
Many years have decided.
But regret is cold.
