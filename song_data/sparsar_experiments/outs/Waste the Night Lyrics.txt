Waste the Night Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


I need your love, need your love, 
 
Taste in your tongue, the smoke in your lungs 
And. I need your love and I need your love. 
The salt on your skin is pulling me in 
And. I need your love and I need your love. 
 
I, don't wan na, say goodbye to another night. 
And watch you walk away, 
I, don't wan na. Let it burn in the city: lights 
And make the same mistakes 
 
This time, 
_I, don't wan na waste; it don't wan na waste. It 
I! Don'T wan na waste it don't wan na waste, it 
I, don't wan na waste, it 
Don't wan na waste. The night 
I don't wan na waste. It don't wan na waste. It 
I, don't wan na waste. It don't wan na waste. It 
I, don't wan na waste. It 
Don't wan na waste, the night_ 
 
The scratch in your voice leaves me no choice. 
And I won't give up and I can't give up. 
 
I, don't wan na say goodbye to another night. 
And watch you walk away, 
I, don't wan na. Let it burn in the city: lights, 
And, make the same mistakes 
 
This time, 
_I, don't wan na waste; it don't wan na waste. It 
I, don't wan na waste; it don't wan na waste. It 
I, don't wan na waste. It 
Don't wan na waste. The night 
I don't wan na waste, it don't wan na waste. It 
I, don't wan na waste. It don't wan na waste. It 
I, don't wan na waste. It 
Don't wan na waste. The night_ 
 
I, don't wan na, say goodbye to another night. 
I, don't wan na, let it burn in the city: lights, 
, 
I, don't wan na, say goodbye to another night. 
And watch you walk away, 
I, don't wan na! Let it burn in the city: lights 
And make the same mistakes: 
 
, Luke,
