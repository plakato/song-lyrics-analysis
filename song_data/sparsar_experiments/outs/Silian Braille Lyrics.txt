Silian Braille Lyrics
by The Purist.

I get piff from The Purist

My. Sniff is the purest
One thing thats the surest
You will get bumped like a tourist

London
Grey. Skies

I touch road from morning
Dark clouds are forming
And, the dope fiends are swarming
Police, come without warning
Residents informing cos their neighbours keep scoring
And the blocks. All smell appalling
Mad, roaches, crawling
I ain't, balling
Im, 8 Ballin
I'm, yet to go all in
But see that might change if these prices keep falling
And. These clients keep calling
Top gear, no stalling
These, dumb niggers, I'm schooling
Ruling
No snap-backs, just black bags and backpacks
Envelopes with white powder
But nah its, not anthrax
Running, out
Hit Badger up and see. If he has that
Not long link, up
Exchange stock, NASDAQ
My, syntax too abstract
But, most man wouldn't catch. That
My contact got A.Cs
Their. Dropping in Halifax
If the bitch try to back track
Swear down she'l get slapped
Right outside that bank fam
Give, a fuck, clap that

Wraps in my vans
Cracks in my hands
I ain't got no future
No long term, plans
Pyrex and teflon
Dutch pots and pans
Its all grams and grands
Snots. Coming out. My glands

Wraps in my vans
Cracks in my hands
I ain't, got no future
No long term plans
Hour glass near empty
Running, out of sand
I'm talking to the devil
Cos he understands

Half ounce in my satchel
All stories, factual
All stories actual
Accounts is so casual
Bet yet so tactful
How I glamourise there tales of powder and capsules
Drugs. I got a sackful
Mouth full
Cracks like I'm chewing on fruit. Pastels
So brash, not bashful
Got cash cause, I'm holding
More weight than both axels
Just seems so rational
More horse than the grand national
From Chiswick to Chester
Getting that Red Lester
Since way back when
You though caine was a wrestler
I was on that trap. Shit
I. Don'T let my food fester
On, the ball like Iniesta
Lunch at the Dorchester
Feds move, so messed up
When, I'm in court all dressed up
5 years for coke, but 2 for a child molester
Fuck it though
I, don't rest! No siesta
Got! A meeting up, west
To impress an investor

Wraps in my vans
Cracks in my hands
I. Ain'T got no future
No long term plans
Pyrex and teflon
Dutch pots and pans
Its all grams and grands
Snots. Coming out. My glands

Wraps in my vans
Cracks in my hands
I ain't got no future
No long term plans
Hour glass near empty
Running, out of sand
I'm talking to the devil
Cos he understands
