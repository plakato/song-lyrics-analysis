Call It a Ritual Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Well into the desert we must go.
So into the desert we go.
Call it a ritual.
Call it whatever you will.

And you will grow out at me as naturally.
As branches from a tree.
Call it a ritual.
Call it whatever you will.

But you know, they will swing, swing their swords for show.
While your turn your flower petals so slow.

You said the desert will eat us alive.
I said I'll the make decisions you just drive.
You just drive.

And I saw the windmill wings were gone.
I heard the wind come creeping around.
Call it an act of easy mercy.
To tear the structure down.
Call it whatever you will.
Call it whatever you will.

Cause you know, they will swing, swing their swords for show.
While you turn your flower petals so slow.

But I am amazed at how they go.
I am amazed at how they go....

So call it whatever you will.
Call it a ritual.
Call it whatever you will.

You know, they will swing, swing their swords for show.
