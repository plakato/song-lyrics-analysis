Such A Joke Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

Oh, what an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine 
The note he wrote was such a joke. Your friends all laugh until they choke 
Oh. What an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine. 
The note he wrote was such a joke. Your friends! All laugh until they choke 
 
Oh. What an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine 
The note he wrote was such a joke. Your friends all laugh until they choke
