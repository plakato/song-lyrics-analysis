'moonchild' Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


You feel so.
You feel so good babe.
You swear you're down, down.
Down so down.
You swear you're down for me.
All in your vibe, sh*t.
You rep the moon like you're from there babe.
You stay rollin' your eyes.
But ay.
Loki you know i mean all those things.

You ain't gotta tell me twice.
We ain't gotta talk every night.
Never outta mind when you're outta sight.
Babygurl it's our life.
What they don't know ain't gonna hurt them.
Pull the curtains.
Put this work in with me.
Get off tumblr and twitter.
And get on top of this, sh*t.
We not really with the politics.
Black boots with the soccer pants.
We all that in all black, sh*t.
Yea, laid, laid up on the lo-lo.
Gurl we so goals.
Take dope pix, don't post those.
Way i'm feelin' round you got me so focused.
No bullsh*t.
I got all these gift cards to olive garden.
And i wanna blow them all on you.
All on you.

We don't need complicated.
I show you i'm 'bout you, i don't say it.
Keep it lo, that's a given.
Cause i hate when they get an opinion.
We don't need complicated, no.
I show you i'm 'bout you, i don't say it no.
Keep it lo, that's a given.
Cause i hate when they have an opinion.

interlude.
Ay.
Yo.
I miss you too baby.

Way lo, that's the wave.
I don't force calling you babe.
I've never felt like i've meant it.
It's just been something you say.
Lo, just don't get it tied.
I ain't tryna hide you from no one.
Go let them know that you're mine.
Try me gurl, see if i care.
I swear ain't sh*t that i'm scared of.
We just don't make us a scene.
For all this force in between us.
We sho' don't force anything.
We up so late that it's early babe.
I wanna see you through.
You beautiful human you.

Every place, that we go.
Strangers stare, they just know.
They say we slay, hair to toe.
So unbasic, we so goals.
I keep my arms veiny for you.
Keep my new sh*t sounding right.
Cause all them boys you be bumping' kool.
But they ceiling's 'bout deez nuts height.
But i'm schleep.
All i know, we came up.
Never thanked god this much.
You make me wanna go as hard as i can go.
You feel so good babe.
You taste so good babe.
