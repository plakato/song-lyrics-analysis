All I Had Lyrics
by XO (Producer).


The world is so stressful.
Wanted to die.
Allah said, I won't let you.
I smoke a lot, so.
Yeah I'm forgetful.
Mary Jane told me, I'm the one that kept you.
On your shit.
And I ain't ever forget that.
My nigga Tony on his way with a six pack.
We heavy.
Niggas is light like Miller still.
Maybe cause we real disciplined.
Like Navy Seals, we play for the.
Bills.
So.
You should learn to shuffle the cards before you deal.
I'm on some king shit, nigga bow down to the skill.
But you can be on a throne of your own.
Smoke a home grown, put a chick on you like cologne.
You fuck with Sallie Mae, I'm a fuck with Mary Jane.
That's the fragrance you smell on me like every day.
Know I've been fucking her.
Strands of her hair.
On my fingertips.
Cause I be playing in it in the air.

When you see me on the scene.
You can tell that I'm chiefy.
I be smokin' that.
From the UPT.
Spread with fennel leaf.
When I be smoking that.
Cause all I had was my.
So I be smokin' that.
Cause all I had was my.
So I be smokin' that.

Benji got the bamboo.
O got the Dutchies.
The fennel still dryin' in the microwave oven.
Two different kinds of high grade.
Still rollin' up and we just hit five jays.
Niggas on the pill they be up for five days.
And niggas on the wall they be naked on the highway.
That's why I smoke nothin' but chronic.
We ain't ridin' we parkin.
Sparkin', dark tint, right behind some apartments.
No more good regular.
Niggas smokin' 'dro more.
Hey, we will fold your ass like a brochure.
Niggas don't want beef they Kosher.
I'm laughin', chillin' smokin' on chronic from both shores.
One came from the Atlantic.
The other from Pacific.
Probably had three names before a nigga got to hit it.
Still married to Mary Jane.
See the ring, bitches.
That's my bitch for life.
Even let my mans hit it.

When you see me on the scene.
You can tell that I'm chiefy.
I be smokin' that.
From the UPT.
Spread with fennel leaf.
When I be smoking that.
Cause all I had was my.
So I be smokin' that.
Cause all I had was my.
So I be smokin' that.

I smoke a jay to take the pain out.
And if I wasn't high I'd probably try and blow my brains out.
Somethin' in my pocket.
If I pull Game out.
You can stay out and come in and see what this game 'bout.
I came out.
My momma fucked my pops, in front of my damn house.
Blanked out.
I Couldn't get the stains out.
When they came out, I had my heart on my sleeve.
Years after, I was rollin' with fennel leaves.
High up in the sky I don't want to leave.
Married to Mary Jane cause I don't want no seeds.
I ain't escaped from nothin' for real.
But it's nice to dream.
So if you don't achieve this is not for the.
It's ye shall get money, she.
Don't love me.
Like I love her but fuck it I smoke for free.
Let's get bread, hope we can get a loaf for free.
A, F.or R.eal N.iggas O.nly, just smoke with me.

When you see me on the scene.
You can tell that I'm chiefy.
I be smokin' that.
From the UPT.
Spread with fennel leaf.
When I be smoking that.
Cause all I had was my.
So I be smokin' that.
Cause all I had was my.
So I be smokin' that.
