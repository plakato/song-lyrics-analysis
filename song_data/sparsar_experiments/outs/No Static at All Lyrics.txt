No Static at All Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

No static at alllllll, ..., 
, 
MC, Serch 
Beef not needed to waste one 
Cause trouble, don't feed the bass drum 
Some, so feeble so play the hoodlum 
A humdrum liver in bedlam 
Bet, your last buck. You don't laugh to this. 
Your horse came last behind the cactus 
Back, so strong. You thought wrong a fallacy. 
The groove will whip and flip cause. It has to be 
In there, like Belvedere in his underwear 
On the new year, my dear so make it clear. 
I'M gon na ask: do you wan na live small 
Static Nah troop none at all, 
 
Pete Nice 
Why meddle in the middle of a ruckus 
 sip, slowly on Snapple in hand, 
Not these hands of mine, holdin, clippers, 
Slip and clip your flat-top to ceasar 
Ease. Your ego I go toe to toe 
Throw. My voice, like I throw my yo-yo 
And ho ho ho on the mic. Is life support 
And toward a crumb static ain't? My sport 
I swing to this Serch swings to that 
And. As you noticed, they always wear hats. 
Boots and loops produced by Prince Paul 
Slaps ya, skull no static at all 
 .

MC, Serch 
Static mixed in, but it don't cling, 
To, a fat rope, dope, Gucci link or an earring 
Hand. Now gropin for stabbin 
But the hand is used to get skins. 
Skim the cream, but it seems you still rise, 
For some who lives more now. Life lifesize 
All are lepers in my swingdom 
Groups and troops get friends and they bring them. 
In goes props, so pop til, the mornin 
Home to the young pop still snorin 
Wake up. You blockhead and heed the call 
Aiyyo no static at all 
 
Pete Nice 
I flip on kicks my DJ tricks, 
The a.k.a code name, Richie, Rich 
Daddy, Rich. You never watch him on TV 

Full on 1210's flippin, the beats 
*Richie Rich cuts, more* 
Some bust nuts, Daddy Rich bust cuts, 
Such transform over rhythms on dust 
I rush, this rhythm hold like Mingus 
I swing. This joint no static to sting this 
*Richie Rich cuts, more* 
 
Nice, A bitch's brew who snappin gyro 
Serch Scabs can't craft. What only the fly knows: 
Nice Got skins all in on schemin' 

Nice, I'm seemin vexed in my rhymin texts. 
Serch Opened up shop to chop off the hairnets 
Nice I put off punks like junk so sporadic 
Serch Stashed away like old drawers in my attic, 
Nice Or drawers on my legs figures. What I says: 
Serch Snack on Jolly Rancher or Orange Pez 
Nice Yep. This ain't! No collect call 
Serch, So peace, yo, Pete 
Nice No static at all 
Serch, True
