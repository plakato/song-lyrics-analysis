Struggle Lyrics
by Twisted Artistics.


Twisted Artistics.
Team shifted, dream's vivid still.
Mean with the skill, gifted, linguistics kill.
Like Thor's hammer ready to.
swing, lifted  feel.
You AbSouljah when swimming upstream living's ill.
At times. The renegade kind of life in general.
I guess. No high pedestal through days, tight or plentiful.
Just like Daniel upin the lions' den we'll.
Get by if we fully trust Jah.
Bekky, tell 'em...

There will be mountains to climb.
There will be battles fight.
As long as we walk side by side.
There is a hope there's a dream.
We'll reach the goal just believe.
As long as we walk in the light.

Y'all better scream to puncture your lungs now.
And get up for that machine-gun-funk-sound.
Middle-finger to that glitter and glamour.
All will be thrown into the flames of gehenna.
Let not the fact that you ain't got a whole lot of.
Luxuries make you feel ashmed. God alone can judge you.
We're foot-soldiers, infiltrate the whole infrastructure.
With indestructible faith, and you know we got to...

AbSouljah.
