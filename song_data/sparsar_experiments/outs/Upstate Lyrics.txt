Upstate Lyrics
by ZOOpfish.


All this fire coming out the Upstate.
Started thinking thinking maybe you should listen.
Still got it moving through the upstate.
Party cause they love it that a given.
All this fire coming out the Upstate.
Started thinking thinking maybe you should listen.
Still got it moving through the upstate.
Party cause they love it that a given.

This is just so effortless.
I'm just feeling generous so please excuse my cleverness.
Excellence her preference she ain't expecting tenderness.
So we don't give ooh yelling Zϴϴ till the death of us.
Floating like a feather is, these other rappers featherless.
Shitty raps make it hard to climb up, Everest.
Whatever kids, they get in the studio its treacherous.
I Treasure It, Jon Taffer, boys a bar specialist.
Sounding unintelligent, expecting me to rescue it.
You gon need some special shit ,an exorcist, Christ neck a lace.
Creep house in Connecticut, Pray to resurrect your shit.
Blame it on the devil quick and hope for a New Testament.

I mean, who you know as dope as this.
Clean, fresh , mean, in ya face like mommas soap when shit.
You say, is not ok i mean just go do what your supposed to kid.
Wondering why your ex gone and always bought you lotion gifts.
Hoping this is over quick, city boy is pulling shit.
But silly noise is silly noise and really and not our focus bitch.
Taking over everything , keep the parties Socialist.
Zϴϴ got that bear boy, wouldn't go poking it.
I just ruh ruh like a dungeon dragon.
Really rough ya up, if the clans is clashin.
Come to buck buck, fat pat the captain.
Gonn knock ya off the top, make ya wonder what happened.
Sanging.
