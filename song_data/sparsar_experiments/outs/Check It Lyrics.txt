Check It Lyrics
by Vizual.


Ha, Alright Yea uh. Are they ready for this one? I don't know Alright. Let'S
Go 
 
Process is runnin'. The bar 
Over computer screens, 
Almost 95 % 
God is working through me, 
People need'a to see order to believe 
Can't. Tell what's wicked or not 
Mind's, so blurry 
You got ta check yourself, 
Before, you perfect yourself, 
We ain't perfect, but through Christ, 
I get to check myself 
Living. Just so the truth. 
Won'T rust this world is corrupted 
Living from the inside out 
Using my freedom to love. 
Not to lust 
Because lust, bring up void; 
Get all you want, but 
Later on you're out of joint 
Broken down toys, 
This ain't, no playground, 
Won't! Let people pressure my choice: 
I have my crown 
Under authority by the king of kings, 
Standing my ground 
Not feeling dead. 
Walkin' dead, 
I'm finally found 
Covered with that blood got me: uh 
Love, st-rucked, 
Laying down my life 
On, the cross, 
 
Check, it 
Can you take so much 
Food for your spirit, 
Can you take so much 
Check. It 
Can. You take so much 
Food for your spirit. 
Can you take so much 
Cause I've been going down. Hill 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up. 
Cause I've been going down, hill 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 
Got problems with my joy 
Flowing through my voice. 
So much excitement cause 
My vision from The Lord 
Don't need to escape reality. 
Music is a gateway drug 
Fills. Your needs for a while 
But leaves you undone. 
This is hope: music, heal, music 
Food for your spirit, 
Some bind the soul 
From. The problems that need fixin', 
Not dissing 
My aim is at the thrown 
Freedom from the world. 
Leaving, your heart, so cold 
Trying to relate 
In the end. He has the word: 
Good job good and faithful servant. 
Trying to finish this race, home 
Couldn't beat my addiction 
Without, the Holy Ghost 
Not, a sinner, but a saint 
Has, a repentance lifestyle, 
The Devil's, a lair 
Got. The truth, written down 
He comes to grant false hope. 
The void got me out. 
Not fooled by my own voice: 
Can't, even trust myself 
Rolling with the spirit 
Pressing the breaks, woah 
 
Check, it 
Can you take so much 
Food for your spirit. 
Can you take so much 
Check. It 
Can you take so much 
Food for your spirit, 
Can you take. So much 
Cause I've been going down. Hill 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up. 
Cause I've been going down, hill 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up. 
 
Instead of snapchattin', ladies 
To, get a little glimpse, 
Should be taking them to the cross 
For. Their final submit 
Instead of lustin' over this 
I should be working for Him. 
Love is sacrifice 
Might as well start of with this 
Call me a Jesus freak 
You can't stop this fire 
The. Other fires expired 
That's. Why you retired 
Headed towards dead road 
Reason? Why you're, tired 
No more options? 
Fire dies, 
Got, no more wires. 
The truth hit me hard 
Like how the wind blows 
You can't fight the wind 
 Got ta accept the flow 
How long. Will you fight 
For lies? Doesn'T it get old 
Don't get trapped like Lyon, 
Scared stones 
Got a little taste of heaven, 
Ain't' good enough 
Sin's? What you hate, 
You love, the benefits it comes from 
Heart, is so polluted need a new one 
Check it 
Earn the benefits of becoming His son. 
 
Check. It 
Can you take so much 
Food for your spirit, 
Can, you take so much 
Check it 
Can you take. So much 
Food for your spirit. 
Can you take so much. 
Cause I've been going down. Hill 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up. 
Cause I've been going down, hill 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back up, 
 Got ta, get back, up
