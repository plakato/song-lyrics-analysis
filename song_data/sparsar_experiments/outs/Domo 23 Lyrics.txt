Domo 23 Lyrics
by Tyler.

Tyler the Creator.
Sick to my motherfucking tummy.
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy.
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke.
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money.
Popping since Bastard,.
Clancy's my slave master.
Thanks to them crackers, my.
pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper.
I've never popped a bottle,.
but I've fucked a couple models in Europe.
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed.
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in.
And I never pull back,.
shout-out to my nigga Taco.

Fuck that, Golf Wang.
Fuck that, Golf Wang.
Fuck that, Golf Wang.
Fuck that,  x3.

So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit.
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs.
And said I was a racist homophobic.
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing.
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing.
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet.

And while y'all are rolling doobies.
I be in my bedroom scoring movies.
Still excited like a fucking newbie.
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me.
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me.
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty.
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs.
Just to see where my fucking roof be.

Wait a God damn second.
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham.
Would fall cause shit's going down.
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons.
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms.
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction.

It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker.
Anytime you play this shit loud.
But that's just me trying to get milk now.
And the grunts of the god damn cow.

And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure.

Cut it out! I said I didn't want no goddamn lettuce. I don't want that shit! I.
don't want your goddamn lettuce. He-he.
