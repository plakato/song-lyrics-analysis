Changing of the Seasons Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

So it's over, I didn't realize.
It's so much colder.
But it was no surprise.
Did you ever get to know me?
Cause it has never been so plain to see.

And when you say you won't forget me.
Well I can tell you that's untrue.
Cause every day since you left me.
I thought less and less of you.

And I've worn out all the reasons.
To keep on knocking at your door.
Could be the changing of the seasons.
But I don't love you anymore.

The door is open, you whispered to me.
As you stood frozen in deep uncertainty.
I hope that you know what I am thinking.
Before you go with your heart sinking.

You said Come back and spend the night.
Come back and spend the night with me.
X4.
