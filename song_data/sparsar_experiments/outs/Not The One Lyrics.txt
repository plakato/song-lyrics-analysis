Not The One Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

Feel how illusion did more than build me up*.
With all its mellow tones.
Now I am trapped inside.
The door is locked but I've got the keys at hand.
Nothing left to do, I got to go.
My eyes, they deceived me.
Don't be a fool.
This ain't eternity.
So many doubts, this shall end right now.
Don't cry 'bout me.
I'm not the one to bleed.
Your voice won't reach me through this wall of silence.
I feel no need to break it.
Nothing left to say, this is the end.
My eyes, they deceived me.
Don't be a fool.
This ain't eternity.
So many tears, this shall end right here.
DON'T YOU CRY 'BOUT ME.
I'M NOT THE ONE TO BLEED.
FEAR ME.
I AM A DEMON.
YOU CAN'T KILL ME.
BUT TRY TO HURT ME TO KILL THE BLAME.
The criminal inside is stepping back into the shadows.
Tonight he's not the one to bleed.
My eyes, they deceived me.
Don't be a fool.
This ain't eternity.
So many doubts, this will end right now.
Don't cry 'bout me.
I'm not the one to bleed.
I won't bleed.
ORANGE FADES TO BLACK.
