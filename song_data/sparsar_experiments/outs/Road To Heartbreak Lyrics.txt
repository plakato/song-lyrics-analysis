by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Girl: Hello.

Girl: Good mornting. Um…nothing bout to go workout and theeeeeen run some.
errands.
Sy: I was just callin to say good morning.
Girl: Good morning……ok. What's wrong?

Who was the one.
You was the one that.
Said it wouldn't work.
Girl do what you need, do what you want I…
Shoulda put you first, Instead I warned you.
You ain't gotta give me no deadline for you.
It's cuffin season, I'll do fed time for you.
Performing girl I'll be the headline for you…
Fucking right girl, yea.
Fuck dem other bitches I don't wanna lady.
I don't wanna wife em, I just one night em.
I ain't nuthin nice, you ain't nuthin like em.
You so indecisive, I'm so undecided.
Yea, bout to start another fire.
Yea, you so mutha'fuckin bias.
Yea, and you know the winters mines girl, And the summer's ours.
Back when you ain't have a ride girl you was a rider.
Sick of sleeping with these bitches, they fuckin tired.
I'm just hoping that you spare me, no fucking tire.
Baby tell me what it is, I don't want surprises.
Looking at me like a player, a womanizer.
Girl this shit ain't adding up, we so undivided.
Real recognize real, you don't recognize em…
Just walk away…

B4, b4, b4,.
B4, b4, b4,.
B4, b4, b4…...
Yay yay oh yay…...
Yay yay oh yay…...
Yea, Before your heart breaks.

Why you even wanna start bae.
Playing games you ain't even at a arcade.
Don't you dare call me dark trade.
And you sweeter than a parfait.
Showing you affection in the broad day.
Richer than the people on Broadway, meet me on Park Place.
I play the villain like Scarface, ride a wave like shark bait.
You just wanna keep ya heart safe.
But I be doing it the hard way.
You know you gone love me always……just walk away.

B4, b4, b4,.
B4, b4, b4,.
B4, b4, b4…...
Yay yay yay yaaaaaaaaaya.
Yay yay yay yaaaaaaaaaya.
