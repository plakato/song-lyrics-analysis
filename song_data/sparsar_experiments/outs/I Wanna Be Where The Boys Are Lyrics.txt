I Wanna Be Where The Boys Are Lyrics
by The Runaways.


Wild in the streets, barely alive.
Mama's always telling me stay inside.
Don't you hang around with those young boys.
Soon you'll be lovin' them.
They're all night toys.

I wanna be where the boys are.
I wanna fight how the boys fight.
I wanna love how the boys love.
I wanna be where the boys are.

Hot love hear, I got the drive.
Neighbours been bugging me I gotta hide.
I am the bitch with the hot guitar.
I am the air, the sun and stars.

Wild in the streets, barely alive.
Mama's always telling me stay inside.
Don't you hang around with those young boys.
Soon they'll be loving you with all their joy.
