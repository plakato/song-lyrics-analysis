Episode 1 
by Xavier Wulf.


I can't spare no fool.
I must hit all of you, I notice who.
Think they feelin' tough so.
See me comin' through.
I'm pickin' up a bitch by his neck.
I scream What's wrong with you?
He replied Wulf, I must admit.
I shouldn't have fucked with you.
I swung his ass across the damn yard.
And said I'm through with you.
Niggas think just cause I crack a smile.
I won't deplenish whoever.
Gets the slightest damn nerve.
To come and try my crew.
Niggas try to talk real hard.
But all I hear is sissy flutes.
Don't think just cause I'm watchin' anime.
I won't come cripple you.
What the fuck you mean.
If anything, I got the skills to do it.
I don't give no fuck about no bitch.
I tell her Keep it movin'.
She say Can we fuck?
I say Hell naw, cause you a fuckin' user.

I don't talk to hoes up on the internet.
Cause all these fan girls sluts.
Screenshot the chat.
All I need is weed, I smoke that back to back.
Back to back, I mean back to back.
When I say back to back, I mean back to back.
Back to back, we smokin' thrax.
Back to back, back to back.
We smokin' sacks.
Back to back, back to back.
We smokin' packs.
Back to back, back to back.
We smokin' thrax.
Back to back, back to back.
We smokin' packs.
Back to back, back to back.
We smokin' thrax.
Back to back, back to back.
