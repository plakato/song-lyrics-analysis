BiTrektual Lyrics
by Voltaire.

Jason Live long and prosper if you're one of us 
Voltaire May the force be with you. Unless that phrase don't fit you 
Jason Forever. We have been at odds 
Voltaire Cause you're a drooling, Trekkie 
Jason Says the Lucas lackey 
Voltaire Jason, Whatever 
 
Jason. We are out in space the last frontier 
Jason Seeking life. That'S new and strange out here, 
Jason Voltaire and new civilizations in the great beyond 
Jason, boldly going where no one has gone. 
 
Voltaire Our tale is better in every way, 
Voltaire in a galaxy. Far far away 
Voltaire Jason, a great adventure happened a long time ago, 
Voltaire. But then I don't suppose that you would know 
 
Jason. We have ray guns, we call phasers 
Voltaire, We have blasters AND lightsabers 
Jason. We have ships that fly at warp, 
Voltaire Yeah. It'S called Hyperspace, you dork 
Jason, Voltaire, We've got the Mugato and you have got
Ewoks 
Voltaire yeah. Well, a guy who plays with tribbles shouldn't talk, 
 
Jason, Oh, come on: let's not fight, 
Jason Voltaire, it's so unintellectual 
Jason How'bout. We join sides and be bi-trektual 
Voltaire. That'S disgusting, 
Jason yeah forget I mentioned it: 
 
Jason, Klingons, shooting at our starboard side, 
Jason We've got a hull breach on the Enterprise 
Jason Voltaire We drift into the neutral zone and we're on
the wrong side. 
Jason We'd need a wormhole to get out alive, 
 
Voltaire On a moon of Yavin's, where we hide 
Voltaire We're having trouble with the hyperdrive 
Voltaire Jason. This planet keeps on spinning and the Death
star's now in sight, 
Voltaire. We hope the rebels take it out in time. 
 
Voltaire Oh, come on: let's not fight 
Voltaire Jason, it's so unintellectual 
Voltaire How'bout. We join sides and be bi-trektual 
Jason. Wouldn'T it be nice, 
Jason Voltaire and so much more effectual 
Jason. To put our cares aside and be bitrektual, 
 
Voltaire Think how awesome it would be. A 
Voltaire team up with Jean Luc and Leah 
Jason, Kirk and Chewie save the day, 
Jason blowing up a bird of prey, 
Voltaire Han and Spock. They set a net 
Voltaire and trap the Borg and Boba Fett 
Voltaire, While 3P0 and Data raid a Tie fighter to capture Vader 
Voltaire, Jason, Luke and Worf get into it and blow the
Deathstar into bits, 
Jason, And then we throw the tribbles 
Jason Voltaire into the Sarlac Pit 
Voltaire and then we kicked the Ewoks into it. 
 
Jason Live long and prosper so say we all 
Voltaire Wait. What 
Voltaire May the force be with you? May the time Lords, keep you 
Jason Voltaire Forever. We can Babylon 
Voltaire, There's no use debating 
Voltaire Jason. The Stargate's waiting, 
 
Voltaire So come on. Let'S not fight 
Voltaire Jason, it's so unintellectual 
Voltaire How'bout. We join sides and be bi-trektual 
Jason Voltaire. So let's take the advice of an Asian homo-
sexual, ... 
 
Voltaire Fellow Star folks, cool it down. 
Robert Picardo Celebrity voice, impersonated 
, 
Jason Voltaire. Let'S put our cares aside and be bitrektual 
Voltaire Hell. I want to be Sci, Fi, multi-Trektual, 
 
Jason Live long and prosper. 
Voltaire May the force be with you. 
Jason Never give up, never surrender 
Voltaire To infinity and Beyond. 
Jason Really Voltaire Really
