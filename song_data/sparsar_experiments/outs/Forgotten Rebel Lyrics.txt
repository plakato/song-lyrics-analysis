Forgotten Rebel Lyrics
by The Virus.

Boys hanging out at night.
But we ain't living our lives just right.
Living my life with out a care.
Leopard print and tattered, tattered hair.

Because what you don't get you will never know.
I'm living my life like a T.V. show.
Forgotten rebel just like a razor blade.
I'll cut through you in my tirade.
Forgotten Rebel.

Eyes behind my head I feel you're glare.
Reflection in the glass, I feel you're stare.
The spark to my fuse, you light the match.
Cause there ain't no survivors in the aftermath.

Because what you don't get you will never know.
I'm living my life like a T.V. show.
Forgotten rebel just like a razor blade.
I'll cut through you in my tirade.
Forgotten Rebel.

Boys hanging out at night.
But we ain't living our lives just right.
Living my life with out a care.
Leopard print and tattered, tattered hair.

Because what you don't get you will never know.
I'm living my life like a T.V. show.
Forgotten rebel just like a razor blade.
I'll cut through you in my tirade.
