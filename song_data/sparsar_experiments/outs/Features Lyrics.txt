Features Lyrics
by Quentin Miller & Key!.


Yeah, my bitch came with features, my bitch came with features.
My bitch built like Mona Lisa with a platinum Visa.
Drive a 2016 whip and still drop the ceiling.
If she ain't bringing no income, she's just not appealing.
My bitch came with features, my bitch came with features.
My bitch came with features, my whip came with.
My whip came with features, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Okay, my bitch keep my Glock and my tote.
Okay, your bitches, they keep on blowing smoke.
Okay, my bitch got a bumper on her rear.
Okay, my bitch got some diamonds in her ear.
Okay, me and my bitch, we rolling like ?
Okay, with me and she drinking on Bacardi.
Okay, she jump up on the dick and start to ride it.
Just drunk driving, she drunk driving.
Okay, my bad bitch came with more bad bitches.
Okay, they got foreign features just like foreign whips.
Okay, they pull up in it like a car club.
You niggas want some, but look like bald no.

Yeah, my bitch came with features, my bitch came with features.
My bitch built like Mona Lisa with a platinum Visa.
Drive a 2016 whip and still drop the ceiling.
If she ain't bringing no income, she's just not appealing.
My bitch came with features, my bitch came with features.
My bitch came with features, my whip came with.
My whip came with features, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Old school, your bitch is a old school.
Old news, y'all niggas is old news.
No play GTA like Detroit crew.
My bitch get more paper than your boys do.
Yeah, stepped up in this game and wasn't supposed to.
Yeah, me man and Key create our own rules.
Yeah, I got problems, all my niggas got 'em all.
Man, my bitch came with features, I might test 'em out.

My bitch came with features, my bitch came with features.
My bitch built like Mona Lisa with a platinum Visa.
Drive a 2016 whip and still drop the ceiling.
If she ain't bringing no income, she's just not appealing.
My bitch came with features, my bitch came with features.
My bitch came with features, my whip came with.
My whip came with features, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
