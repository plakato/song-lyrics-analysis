I Can't Make You Lyrics
by Unknown Prophets.

I can't make you love me if you don't.
You can't make your heart feel something it won't.
Here in the dark, in these final hours.
I would lay down my heart and I'll feel the power.
But you won't, no you won't.

Big Jess.
It's a never-ending saga.
Sometimes I feel like Why bother?
Trying to survive and keep my head above water.
Oh heavenly father, I need some direction.
These cats around town carry gats for protection.
What's a motherfucker to do?
Cause every time I turn around somebody new try to buck at my crew.
I just want to escape this madness I'm faced with.
And just take a peek at the next life, I'm about to be replaced with.
Turn down the light so I can dim this life.
The dark side shining too bright but hard time through strife.
It's a constant struggle to just keep on living.
Committed so many sins I don't deserve to be forgiven.
In my lifetime, I've seen the worse.
I'm trying to quench my soul but I'm dying of thirst.
I'm trying to reach my goals but it ain't that easy.
I'm reaching out to the lord and asking him to teach me and lead me.
Into the right direction, towards changing correction.
Away from mental infection and away from deception.
And make that spiritual connection, get my shit together.
Use my faith to shelter me from this stormy weather.

And I can't make you love me any more or any less.
And I can't make you relate to the problems I manifest.
I can't make you understand the reasons for my stress.
All I can do is promise that I'll try to do my best.

Cause I can't make you love me.

Big Jess.
I want to be more than you average Joe.
An emcee with an above average flow.
I want to see some major cabbage yo.
If I had the dough, maybe life wouldn't be so savage yo.
I'm feenin' in taking my lady's' hand in marriage yo.
I want to live life like not so much a tragedy.
But just have the opportunity to live lavishly.
I want to flow at a show, filled to capacity.
And not have these stereotypical fuckers laugh-at-me.
I want the chance to be able to live happily.
And gradually become closer to both sides of our family.
Yo I don't want to be just another casualty.
And see my people a victim of a tragic fatality.
I want you to see the best there is to see in me.
And even when you don't trust in the world, you still believe in me.
I want the world to see how these women murdered me.
Brought the hurt to me and scarred me with this insecurity.
I want my girl to see that she means the world to me.
She came to me and said you are my state of emergency.
Yo she's like the doctor, perform surgery.
Filled my heart with love, passion, honesty &amp; purity.
She showed me what a real woman suppose to be.
Don't you ever go away cause I'll die if you weren't close to me.
She's more precious than the money or the cabbage.
And she loves me for me...and you know what?
That's really all that matters.
