Blasphemy Lyrics
by Tyler Joseph.

I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I.
Don't know where I should go.
And the tears and the fears begin to multiply.
Taking time in a simple place.
In my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase.
And it's said that a war's led.
but I forget.
That I let another day go by.
I want to be afraid but it seems that these days.
I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther.
My heart's getting harder, I'm.
calling my father.
Am I screaming to an empty sky?
Empty sky, no way, that's me cause one half of my heart is free.
Empty sky, no way, that's me cause the other half of my heart's asleep.

Sing a song but don't believe.
Blasphemy is just for me.
Hypocrite, take your pick.
Cause the poison's on my lips.

Can I understand you?
Can I understand you?
Can I understand you?
Can I understand you?

Lights, camera, action, satisfaction.
At your finger tips no one's.
lacking stuff.
But it's not enough when it seems that.
We have enough stuff just to blow stuff up.

Lights, camera, stop! We're.
killing ourselves.
Just to get to the top.
But we won't stop talking about what we got.
And how we all love it when we're loved a lot.

Enough about you, let's talk about me.
And how everybody thinks I'm just so free.

And how my own body's waging war on me?

I bet you didn't know something as absurd.
There's a word that is said more than any other word.
It's sorry, sorry.
And I pray that the word was heard.

Sing a song but don't believe.
Blasphemy is just for me.
Hypocrite, take your pick.
Cause the poison's on my lips.

Can I understand you?
Can I understand you?
Can I understand you?
Can I understand you?

I want to be alive.
When you see my eyes.
Can I see your eyes?
Can I see your eyes?

Can I see your eyes.
Can I see your eyes?
Can I see your eyes?
Can I see?
I want to be alive.
When you see my eyes.
Can I see your eyes?
Can I see your eyes?

Let the water wash away.
Everything that you've become.
On your knees, today is gone.
And tomorrow's sure to come.
Tomorrow's sure to come.
