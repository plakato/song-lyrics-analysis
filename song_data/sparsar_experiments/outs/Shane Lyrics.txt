Shane Lyrics
by Von Grey.

Are you there?
I can feel your hand in mine.
I hope you feel the way that I do.
But where are you?
Shane.
Im so confused.
I dont know where to go.
Only thing I have to do.....
But where are you.
Shane.
Ohh.
It's a bittersweet pain.
Ohh.
But Im the one to blame.
Ohh.
Cuz I know I'll stay.
Ohh.
So where are you?
Shane.
I can't sleep.
You're everywhere I go.
It's hard it's so hard.
But where are you?
Shane.
Ohh.
It's a bittersweet pain.
Ohh.
But Im the one to blame.
Ohh.
Cuz I know I'll stay.
Ohh.
So where are you?
Shane.
And I tried to let you go.
But your pull was just too strong.
Is there a way out?
Where are you?
Shane.
