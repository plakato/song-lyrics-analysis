Before we go Lyrics
by ZSK.

Strophe 1.
To the world it's an insult.
To plea for peace without meaning it.
Why can't we keep the distance.
Between our friend and enemies.

Refrain.
Before we go we keep our heads up.
Before we go are you ready or not?
To leave a footprint in your book.
Something important if you could.
Footprint in your book.

Strophe 2.
Now it's time that you stand up.
And face the fear that controls us.
Why can't we find the answer.
To put an end to the agony.
This a movement.
For the angry and dedicated kids.
We won't pass the chance.
Where we change what we can't stand.

Refrain.

Before we go we keep our heads up.
Before we go are you ready or not?
