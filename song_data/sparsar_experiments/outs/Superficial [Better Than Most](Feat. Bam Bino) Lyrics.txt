Superficial [Better Than Most](Feat. Bam Bino) Lyrics
by Vo-Kal.

Superficial.
Produced by Vo-Kal.

Ignored calls.
Closed bathroom door stalls.
I question my sanity crying on the floor.
Pause.
I guess I'm so appalled.
And my bedroom is walled.
As prison for my memories.
My brain is sprawled.
Solace?
No I can't get none.
Sleeping on the rising sun.
All my family worried.
Cause the Guinness and the Jameson.
I'm ok only my flow sick.
My V6 knock you to the floor bitch.
It's me and Hobbz until the end.
So on the way out don't you let the door hit.
It's impossible for you to ignore this.
I don't care just pour it.
Just top it off, I'll take it back.
No chaser needed to enjoy it.
No chaser needed this boy shit.
This toy shit I torch it.

Gyarados to his koi fish.
Scary hoes at his door step.
I take care of hoes no horse shit.
I meant girls this my warning.
My tongue slipped exploring.
You really think I'm lame.
And I know it now.
Bound to fall in love.
Just praying I don't hit the ground.

My whip.
It's rides well.
My flow.
It rides well.
My job.
It pays well... Ok I mean it pays ok.
I got the car and the clothes.
What more could you ask for.
I heard that girls love.
The superficial asshole X2.
So why don't she fuck with me.
Huh.
So why don't she fuck with me.
I got it all and everything she said she wanted.
Ghost of the girlfriend past.
Cause now my everything is haunted.

My cash is green.
My car is clean.
Now I don't understand why shorty not up on my team.
It take a boss to get a bitch like this.
These niggas broke.
But all I need is convo.
I'm hoping that be the note.
I'm spitting my real feelings.
I'm hoping that be the quote.
Sex game on point.
And I know she like to drink.
I hope she fucking with that Henney.
Cause that's all I like to drink.
Sex appeal I love her style.
Her wardrobe.
Them colors so wild.
Turn down we never go mild.
Take trips I got that.
Her interest is not at.
Me I'm surprised that.
She don't want to mess with a real nigga.
Polo socks.
Tommy Hilfiger.
Tell me what you want.
I'll spend figures.
End of the night we all alone.
So are you.
So what's wrong.
Talk to me what's on your mind.
I ain't in a rush I got time.
Emotions they in the air.
Contact all we do is stare.
But Vo-Kal do she really care.

Cause now my everything is haunted.
Cause now my every move is taunted.
All I wanted.
Was the superficial flaunting.
Trophy wife that was my type.
Still beautiful in the morning.
Great head for the head aches.
Stay in bed till her legs shake.
Take her out on a vaca'.
Tokyo our main stay.
Bring her out on the main stage.
When I perform insane day.
When I propose on that same day.
Fall in love again like our first date.
