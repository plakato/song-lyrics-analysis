Vertigo Lyrics
by Quanche.


Money influenced many been through. It plenty sense to it: 
Get that stack rinse through it get that back flex with it 
Cause you the next with it ditch the next bittie call your ex hit it argue
when, the sex, finished 
Fuck ya. I'M self proclaimed. I expected this shit looking slick grabbing, my
dick being profane 
I'm back on my uh happy as fuck gun in my jacket, jack it and run 
I. Put my lighter up. Flamed out same route, 90A 512 tryna behave myself 
Keep my lighter up. They say its a hierarchy'round here, 
But fuck, that shit we scream anarchy out here. 
Living wasn't easy: breezy
