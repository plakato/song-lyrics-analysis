Subterranean fire Lyrics
by Twisted Artistics.


Effortless like I'm kicking both my feet up.
moment the beat drop.
Like a direct blow to your weak spot.
We got it swinging like a nun chuck.
Bringing that uncut.
Champion sound, ringleader non stop.
Stay on top of things like surface.
Fire to fry your circuits.
Eyes on a higher purpose.
Raggedy prophet, storming into the kings' palace.
And have 'em cling their talisman 'till their fingers callus.
I've got a few broken teeth up in my big mouth.
Fingertips plow.
Through crates..
Cats are trying to figure out.
Just what kinda air I'm breathing.
Them pharisees, them.
Bug out, tear out their hair, even.
It's the shadow stealth fighter, liberator.
Snuck in beneath the radar.
I spit a green vapor.
Over strange maneuvers.
On these ancient computers.
Suckers couldn't hang if their name was Judas.

Shock therapy, wreck your whole setup.
To knock your head up.
And inject the proper data.
We go vulcano on the game without challenge.
Yo, we're moving like some runaway felons.
Put the mic down and hand over the cheddar.
Imposter competitors empty out their bladder.
Your fame don't match the immaturity of your talent.
I'm straight pouring out your cup, restoring the ballance.
