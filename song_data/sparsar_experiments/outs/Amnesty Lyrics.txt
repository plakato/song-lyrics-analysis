Amnesty Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

Doctor! Doctor! Check all the vitals.
This tragedy struck is done and it's final.
Don't you, don't you know it's been said?
You can be alive while already dead.

Once laid in darkness with no plan devised.
The slightest glimpse of light would burn my eyes.

I feel the life His wounds impart.
Oh how much grace You've afforded to me!
Of a burden lifted from my heart.
How many graces been given and free?
My chains fell off, my heart was free.
Arose went forth and followed Thee.

I was a slave to sin with wrists bound by steel.
It was an open wound from which I could not heal.
So dull I couldn't feel; Your fangs had caught my heel.
Those lies they did conceal; the truth my God reveals.
Hell is an open grave, my sin was pushing me in.
Helpless you heard my cries.
You are the hand to save, dove in You're pulling me out.
Rescued from my demise.

I feel the life His wounds impart.
Oh how much grace You've afforded to me!
Of a burden lifted from my heart.
How many graces been given and free?
My chains fell off, my heart was free.
Arose went forth and followed Thee.

I was a slave to sin with wrists bound by steel.
It was an open wound from which I could not heal.
So dull I couldn't feel; Your fangs had caught my heel.
Those lies they did conceal; the truth my God reveals.
Long had my soul been prison bound.
Awaiting till the death march sounds.
My chains fell off, my heart was free.
Arose went forth and followed Thee.
I feel the life His wounds impart.
No longer prisoned I'll lay.
I feel the Savior in my heart.
Nothing will take that away.
Nothing will take that away.
Nothing will take that away.
Nothing will take that away.
Nothing will take that away.
Take that away.

I bow before the throne of amnesty.
My sins are washed away, how can it be?
You rule with grace and love to show mercy.
To show mercy.
To show mercy.

Oh how much grace You've afforded to me!
