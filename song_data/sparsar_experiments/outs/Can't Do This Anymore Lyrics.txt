Can't Do This Anymore Lyrics
by Unique B..


I can't take it, so I won't do it. No more 
It ain't, all that cool and I'm still making no dough 
My equipment, ain't cheap., It ain't crap! With my brother 
I'm doing this alone.. I don't need any other 
 
And to my peoples. It may be a bit embarrassing: 
Outside, I'm outcasted, but inside I'm very in 
I, vary within my style. Smell hatred within the mile, 
This talent, stacked back on the market, isle 
 
I'm, not a user. Just an active abuser, 
Of the terms, stupid overrated and loser 
And. I'M neither. I'm actually the opposite: 
And underrated winner with some knowledge of a college, kid 
, 
And, look! What college did I meant middle school 
Sorry mama for the changes they wasn't cool 
Everybody thinks I follow the rules or don't 
And. For that I won't 
 
Can. You stay up for the weekend, 
And play golf and looking too old 
Can you find all that you stand for 
I've just been replaced with millions ago. 
Can. You dream yourself to mountains. 
I can feel pain and swallow fear. 
Can. You stay up for the weekend or next year. 
 
What am I saying That would be stupid 
See. I said it again: I'm such a fucking in loser, 
My shit is overrated.. Actually I hate it. 
I understand these haters. So I'mma see you later 
 
What. Am I sayin, I'm too cool and too schooled 
Need to get up on my feet and stop acting like a fool: 
I'm rapping, not actin, cool., I'm not old and not actin new 
I'm straight. I know the rules. They hate. They look like fools. 
 
My career ain't, a fraction through 
I'll die, but first I'll do 
I'll cry, but only for you 
And. If you knew it would be cool, but it ain't, 
 
I'm got ta. Tell you now or we'll never be. The fate 
I lie about my feelings.. That'S the only time I'm fake 
Amazingly lazy never been on a date 
But. I think we can change
