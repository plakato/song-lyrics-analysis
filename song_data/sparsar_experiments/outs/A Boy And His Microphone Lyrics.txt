A Boy And His Microphone Lyrics
by Quarta Quarta.

Life is truly beautiful, I'm blessed in everyway.
It was 2 years ago, I said let's go to Cash America today.
Then laid eyes on the perfect microphone, 6 dollars for layaway, it truly lit.
up my soul.
I was searching for equipment, so I could fulfill my purpose.
Mac was six hundred, I saw it was truly worth it.
Shopping at these stores ever since the age of 4, now I can spread my message.
every time I hit record.
Every second they give me, I'm spreading positivity.
In this world that loves slow, but we destroy with agility.
Keyboard and MPC, I only needed 40.
Now I can play these keys while I'm telling my story.
Such a blessing knowing value of money in adolescence.
Every single song always brought me suggestions.
And every single deal always taught me a lesson.
18, broke college kid with only dreams.
And money doesn't grow on trees.
But Cash America gave this boy a microphone, and that's the only thing I need.
