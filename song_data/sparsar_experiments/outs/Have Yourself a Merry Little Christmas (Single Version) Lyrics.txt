Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas (Single Version) Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
May your heart be light.
From now on our troubles will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Make the Yuletide gay.
From now on our troubles will be miles away.
Here were are as in olden days.
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us.
Gather near to us once more, yeah.
Through the years we all will be together.
And if the fates allow.
Hang a shining star on the highest bough, yeah.
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
