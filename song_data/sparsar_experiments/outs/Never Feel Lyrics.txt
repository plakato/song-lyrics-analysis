Never Feel Lyrics
by Viza.

She swims across her sea of casualties.
I crawl across her fields so frantically, until her fire consumes my numbing.
heart.
Until the choir serenades me through the dark.
Never feel and never love.
Never love and never fear.
Forever torn, now I know i'll never feel.

She sways across her winds of majesty.
I wait along her cherub balcony, until her fire consumes my numbing heart.
Until the choir serenades me through the dark.

Never feel and never love.
Never love and never fear.
Forever torn, now I know i'll never feel.
