Valley [Panda Freestyle] Lyrics
by Yung Rudd.


Yo 
Feels good to be back 
Happy 4/20 everybody 
2 Much Vybz, 
Yo 
You, know 1 thing. I always rep, where I'm from dawg 
You know where that is 
Valley/Diego. 
 
I'm, a boss from the valley, 
This rapping shit right up my alley: 
All these mooks them they're. Faling 
I tell them Hold up there. Pally ... 
Try, pull me down like some panties 
When you be secretly fanning. 
Dread allyuh should call me Manning 
Cause. I smoked 2 super bowls with my ex girl. 
Who live up in Cali 
Yeah. She, my ex but she's family, 
She, believe's I'll, be real big 
And that I'm fresh, like I'm Mannie 
Sending, some love to my granny 
Elsie. What'S cracking 
I got your backing 
Crazy that you understand me 
Promise you I'll win a grammy, 
 
Real nigga on the flow 
Man. I swear. It feels so good to be back. 
Can'T stand the faking niggas be MAC. 
Please give up on the show. 
Beast is, what's the mode 
Girls be constantly asking: What's up 
But, they say women be shady like the 
Retreat in bago 
 
The government lies and gets caught a lot 
Yet still. We do not do more to stop. 
That shit is rather unorthodox. 
That'S. Why? I write down these thoughts. A lot 
I have as much respect for ignorance, 
As. I have for neighbourhood enforcer cops 
So. I work hard to secure the top 
Lyrics they've got a scope for the ops, 
 
Shoutout Worm, 
Addict Gang 
Shoutout birds, 
Have, this wang 
Shoutout Nokhs 
That nice tree 
Inzey's, moms, 
RIP, 
 
Congrats on the new soca monarch. Now the youth have a Voice 
Preedy and Anson. In second Just want to shout out my boys 
Got, a hot girl send her like Marcos, sure I'ma score like Reus 
D cups, Ain't. No second, guessing like if it's B in multiple choice, 
Yeah I'ma get her moist 
Then light up that kush cause. I have the spark 
Niggas they're fishy, like kois 
But. I catch you all like a magikarp 
Friendsing with allyuh men, I'ma pass 
I, don't trust shit., Even check TP after I wipe my ass 
Roll up a big one and light it fast 
'Til, I'm the highest 
After. I smoke back out to work bout dollar signs like I'm Ty, it's 
Fuego when I flick my wrist 
 
Always be repping. That Trinity 
Trapso got people into me. 
Although a Rudder done been a beast 
Some people moving so finnicky 
But. There'S the people who tell me good luck: 
And break a leg, no injury, 
How! I come up with these similes 
Scooby Doo can't solve that mystery. 
 
Just know that I'm too ill 
Some say that I'm too chill 
I win doe like 2 sills, 
From inbetween them. Two hills: 
That's Valley, 
, 
Valley Valley, 
Valley/Diego, 
Valley, Valley, Valley, 
Alongside, Diego 
Valley Valley, 
Valley, Valley, Valley, 
Vally/Diego
