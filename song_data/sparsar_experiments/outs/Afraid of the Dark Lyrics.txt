Afraid of the Dark Lyrics
by Twiztid.

Hey!

The darkness is coming.
Now get to somewhere with some fuckin' light.
Or get taken on a wicked ass journey.
The other side of reality.
Close your eyes as we step into the night.

You're scared of the dark.
We'll be visiting haunted houses, getting possessed.
And even going to hell like, hey!
Somebody tell em we're back and better that ever.
And bringing the cemetery to their face.
We be rocking the dead like nobody ever could.
And bringing the boogieman to the stage.
So get ready for the darkness, as the night consumes the day.

It's creeping again, eating everything.
All of them are not ready.
But something tells me.
When the lights go out.

You're scared of the dark.
Now get to somewhere with some fuckin' light.
You're scared of the dark.
Don't get taken on the wicked ass journey.
You're scared of the dark.
Don't get taken on the wicked ass journey.
You're scared of the dark.
