Drain the Blood Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Well I felt you drain the blood.
From my left ventricle.
Anytime you said you would.
Change my heart into petrified wood.

Oh oh oh I'm really trying.
To save you tonight.
To save you tonight.

Oh oh oh I'm really trying.
To make it through the night.
To make it through the night.

Open your heart.
Open your hands.
I love the moment that you command.
It's true.
Loving you.

Open your heart.
Open your hands.
I love the moment that you command.
It's true.
Loving you.

Oh oh oh I'm really trying.
To save you tonight.
To save you tonight.

Oh oh oh I'm really trying.
To make it through the night.
To make it through the night.

I felt you drain the blood.
From my left ventricle.
Anytime you said you would.
Change my heart into petrified wood.

Oh oh oh I'm really trying.
To make it through the night.
To make it through the night.

Oh oh oh I'm really trying.
To save you tonight.
To save you tonight.
