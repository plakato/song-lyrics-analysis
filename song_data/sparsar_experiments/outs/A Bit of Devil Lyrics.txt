A Bit of Devil Lyrics
by Zodiac.

So, so long now.
Been holding back that feeling.
That been jumping on my track.
I've been strong but it's don't know.
I've been wrong but it's kinda old.
Lend me this something new.
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna, let it all out.
I'm gonna, let it all out.
I'm gonna, let it all.
Devil got a hold of me.
And I just had to set him free.
Tell me God was it me or was it he.
Fallen angel, twisted game.
... it's all the same.
I've been the devil in this angel you see.
Devil got a hold of me.
And I just had to set him free.
Tell me God was it me or was it he.
Fallen angel, twisted game.
... it's all the same.
I've been the devil in this angel you see.
You, you keep on walking your walk.
And talking your talk.
Cause is so.
Right to be loosing your mind.
To put your soul I'm alive.
Don't need, your moral walls.
My plastic toy just waiting to fall.
Ain't nothing new to me.
Society's cunt I'll never be.
I'm gonna, let it all out.
Devil got a hold of me.
And I just had to set him free.
Tell me God was it me or was it he.
Fallen angel, twisted game it's all the same.
I've been the devil in this angel you see.
Devil got a hold of me.
And I just had to set him free.
Tell me God was it me or was it he.
Fallen angel, twisted game.
... it's all the same.
I've been the devil in this angel you see.
