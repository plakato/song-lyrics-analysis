White Mice Lyrics
by Sweet.

Sweet woman, you know you're gonna give me the shakes.
You know it's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.
Oh, baby turn your back on me.
Oh yeah, your back on me tonight.
Yeah, it's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.

White mice.
Into your head.
Out of my head.
Gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.

Pretty baby, gonna drive you wild tonight.
You know it's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.
Oh honey, gonna spend my money.
Oh yeah, I'm gonna spend my money on you.
I said it's gonna be alright.
You know it's gonna be alright.

White cat.
Into my head.
Out of my head.
It's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.

Gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.

Dear lover, gonna make you spread tonight.
You know it's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.
Oh baby, gonna paste your face.
Oh yeah, face to face with you.
It's gonna be alright.
You know it's gonna be alright.

White light.
Into my eyes.
I saw the light.
It's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.
