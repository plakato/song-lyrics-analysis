Genius of Love 2002 Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

Bizmarkie 

Hey, Hey 
This, is Diabolical BizMarkie 
And we gon na. Do it like this 
Rhymin' to the B-I-Z-M-A-Z-A 
And, give ya R-I-C-K 
And I'll break ya day, 
Super educator, in-human or destruct 
I'm here with the X-Ecutioners 
 
Female Voice 
I'm in heaven, 
Who you wit' baby 
With. My boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend 
There's no beginning, and there is no end 
Time, isn't present in that dimension. 
He'Ll take my arm. 
When we're walking rolling and rocking 
It's one time, I'm glad I'm not a man 
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping 
 
Who needs a beat when your feet just go. 
 
Who needs a beat when your feet just go: 
 
The Biz, the Biz, the Biz 
Its, the Biz, the Biz, the Biz 

Whatcha gon na. Do when ya get a chick 
I'm gon na have some sex baby 
What. Do you consider fun, 
Like some safe sex? 
Whatcha gon na do when ya get a chick 
I'm gon na have some sex 
What. Do you consider fun, 
Lotta, good sex, 
, 
2X, 
 
I'm in heaven, 
Who you wit' baby 
With, the mavin' of funk-u-tation 
Cleansance musicians such as Bootsy Collins, 
Raise expectations to a new intention. 
No one can sing 
Quite like Smokey Smokey, Robinson 
Wavin' and skankin' to Bob Marley 
Reggae's expanding with Sly and Robby 
 
3X 
 
Hey

Hey. How did you know it was me 
I'm. The original B-I-Z 
M, the A-R-K-I with the E 
Rob Swift, is down with me. 
Rhymin Rock Raider is down with me. 
My man, Eclipse is down with me: 
Sinister is down with me'. 
So come on everybody and party 
 
Whatcha gon na do when ya get a chick 
I'm gon na have some sex baby 
What. Do you consider fun 
Like some safe sex, 
Whatcha gon na do when ya get a chick 
I'm gon na have some sex 
What? Do you consider fun 
Lotta good sex, 
, 
3X, 
 
Check it out y'all 
Ya, don't stop 
Keep on 
The way. We get the old school soundin', goin' 
And, everybody say: 
The original man 
With the master plan, 
 ...
