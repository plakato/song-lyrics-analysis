Politics Lyrics
by Womanly Hips.

Sick of politicians lying vilifying refugees.
Solidifying power by creating common enemies.
Propaganda pushing that these people are a threat to me.
But luckily I don't believe a fucking thing you've said to me.
In The Australian or whatever newspaper that you read.
Casually, blowing bloated boats to debris.
That's just murder.
Doesn't matter if it's been approved by Murdoch.
Subsequently their side to the story.
Is all the people heard of.
Shit ain't gonna change unless we make it happen.
If we're taking action through a protest or tasteful rapping.
Might be wishful thinking but it could begin a chain reaction.
Make sure that in three years we get a change of captain.

Cause real talk, Tony Abbott can suck a dick. I hate that guy. Jesus.
Fuck. Just let people gay people get married for fuck's sake, oh my god.

They say they fight for peace, that's obviously impossible.
Killing people like they killed alternatives to fossil fuels.
To fund it all they cutting funds from public schools and hospitals.

Think that slavery ended? Well then they've got us fooled.
The only difference between now and the eighteen hundreds.
Is the fact that it's the class not a race that's going under.
Why bother using whips and chains.
When for a little bit of pay, people do shit the same.
And don't confuse money for freedom.
We just waste it on a bunch of shit we don't need and.
What makes anyone living in a first world country.
Have the right to buy three cars while other people are hungry?
If all people are equal, and I think we can agree.

Don't get me wrong this applies to me as well.
I just think it's fucked up the way we see ourselves.
