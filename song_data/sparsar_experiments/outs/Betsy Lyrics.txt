Betsy Lyrics
by Univore.

I'm always waiting on Betsy.
She's always making me wait.
My friends all ask me, where's Betsy?
If she don't hurry, we gonna' be late..

She's not that punctual,.
But what's the rush anyway?
You'd wait too.
If you knew.

Don't you worry 'bout Betsy.
She just went out for a swim.
You know how she loves the water.
She just can't help but jump in.

She's not that punctual,.
But what's the rush anyway?
You'd wait too.
If you knew.

I'm getting worried 'bout Betsy.
It's getting dark on the beach.
She's been swimming for hours.
She's so far out of reach.

She's not that punctual,.
But what's the rush anyway?
You'd wait too.
If you knew.

The sand is damp in the morning.
And the tide has gone out.
I guess it's heaven for Betsy.
I had to wait to find out.

She's not that punctual,.
But what's the rush anyway?
You'd wait too.
If you knew.
