A Nation Once Again Lyrics
by Unknown.

A Man Without a Woman.
Now a man without a woman is like a ship without a sail.
Is like a boat without a rudder, or a shirt without a tail.
Now a man without a woman is like a wreck upon the sand.

Then it's a woman, I said a woman.
I mean a woman without a man.
Filename mannowom.
