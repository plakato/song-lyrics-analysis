You Need It Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


As I creep through the shady tower. I tuck a piece of ambition in my lucky
trousers 
My momma told me not to lose it. It lies with me, but it's still the truest 
I love it. How it keep me warm, I hate it. How it keeps me torn 
Lately, it's been doing well staying afloat. Now I get to sail 
Yeah. Hopefully I get to sell. Hopefully you wish me well 
Well want me to fail to your aching bones. 
I know you ain't the type to drown alone. 
 
I'mma keep it one hundred with niggas cause you need it. 
Revolutionary nigga give me all those keezes 
I'm, locking the future. I'Mma pick it with my thesis. 
Thank me. Whenever nigga, I told you that you need it. 
 
Spitting, like camels, I'm illy to my enamel 
Reality in a box, you rushing to change channels, 
Know that you feel it from another city. I know 
I wonder if they wan na fuck with me, 
Kinda sorta. As long as I stay in order 
Try to keep it level, I'm constantly switching floors. 
Hide me from the truth. These niggas is Dumbledore. 
I want so many lovers. They rumble arena floors 
Dreaming, since my toddlers 
Push me to a future. That'S now a past to my fathers. 
Even though he wish me luck, I could read the subtext. 
 Wan na see me graduate just another subject: 
 
Humble as pie, I'm cooling your self esteem 
Kind of ironic nigga like watching yourself dream 
Snotty nose when hitting these pot holes. 
Take me from the trouble of getting my car towed 
Relateable. That'S a fact: I'm knowing how it is. I don't wan na go back 
Nope and I don't wan na be whack. 
Don'T wan na move into a mansion then move into a flat 
Progressive. As the time clicks 
Inside, I found my light. Switch 
Don't wan na get distracted by them light skins. 
These hoes is fine, but not fine enough to pay rent
