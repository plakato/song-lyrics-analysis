Let it Breathe Lyrics
by 6th Sense.

Cosmic dust, 
Uh uh, 
Uh, huh, yeah, 
Uh, huh, yeah 
Uh check it. 
 
I sent it back to you after you sent it to me, 
Cuz nuttin' in this world's more expensive than free 
And. Everything I am is the best I could be 
You must be mistaken. Unintentionally, 
See we be sunnin' when we run up in the room, 
Filet so smooth, you can cut it with a spoon. 
These mignon's been on another numbered groove 
6th just got it back and I'm runnin on the move. 
Ain'T nothin, I can do but show you sunttin'. I can prove 
I'm stumped on the clues. Cuz I'm drunk up off the booze 
I'm clued bring the funk up off the blues. 
And sprinkle it with jazz more pizazz when, amongst these other dudes 
Who's that where we are 
I'm up in the crib rubbin up on some quinoa 
You, see my de-mean-or 
More up and down than see-saws 
Old. In the lines I put 3 on 
My line back is 1 more so my gun is a 3/4 
I, see ya'll hold on-let it breathe. Yall 
 
You sent it back to me soon, as I sent it to you, 
Subpar artists. I could mention a few 
Even. If I vent it ain't the best, I presume, 
Just, stop I'll, show you what prevention could do, 
Just to get ice spent, all of they bread- 
They'll be nothin round my neck worth more than my head, 
And cuz, I said head these fags'll try to pause me! 
Where ya, head at 
Right, you lost me: 
I dont condone it. If your homophobic 
Cuz to me, it just seems more likely, that'chu homo, don't it 
Ha 
A new lease on my life. I'Mma, try to own it, 
I wouldn't try to phone. It. 
I been carvin out. The beats so pardon on the speech- 
I ain't the hardest on the streets, but I'm the artist of the week. 
Sweet 
This-shit was all good. Just a week, ago- 
I ain't'gon. Let the speakers blow I'mma, just let it breathe. Yall
