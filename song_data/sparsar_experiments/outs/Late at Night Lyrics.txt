Late at Night Lyrics
by 404WILL.


Late at night tell me who you callin x3.
See my fit don't know what to call it.
All my young niggas keep it solid.
I heard em talkin so that mean they watchin x2.
You see a millie when you see my closet.

Late at night i heard you pillow talkin.
I wasn't there so how you pillow talkin.
I just been mobbin.
Young American g.
U canary the streets.
Singing every time u see.
Even if it's offkey.
Get these niggas off me.
Outfit costly.
Changed the topic.
When you lost me.
Now I'm back here.
Rappin like last year.
Blowin money fast here.
Block life jazz here nigga.
My stock ten.
Mailman.
Jazz here nigga.
Ion really see.
How i ain't spazz here nigga.
Feelin like drake when he was so far gone.
Feelin like me when I would so far roam.
I'm back to them days puttin out classics.
PJ See the world from every axis.
Probably in Barney's wit a actress.

Who shot ya, who shot ya.
Nah hoe I ain't the devil this that new prada.
Rim rocker.
Shawn kemper.
Don't say the wrong thing i gotta bad temper.
This a glimpse of Biggie but I'm skinny.
Want a millie and a Bentley.
Wit my niggas I'm not kidding.
For dem I would give a kidney.
I'm Finessin round the city.
U can betcha hoe wit me.
Put my niggas on they feet just so they can make a living.
I'm forgiven I'm forgiven.
Spinning and i'm winning in the same sentence.
I'm all 10 on a top 5 and I ain't finished.
Real east side nigga.
Flyer than a G5 nigga.
Tryna eat my nigga.
Order up.
That dish.
Can't pronounce the name.
It just make us feel rich.
