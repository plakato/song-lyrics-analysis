Ph.D (Playing The Hand Dealt) Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


They on their Shania Twain, don't impress me much/.
Look stupid, like Presley in a blue suit and tux/.
I'm built so strong yet so smooth, like a Mazda truck/.
My only skill's getting flukes, cause I mastered luck/.
My mind tapped like oil reserves in Alberta/.
Got nerve son? / to face machine gun flows with nerf guns?! /.
Pew Pew/ the game is my property/ so I'm telling.
All y'all dogs to get off my lawn, so shew shew/ don't bother me/.
Y'all Illusionsts, got your tricks, no real dudes/.
Got punch Houdini in his kidney lines, they'll kill you/.
So just give me my whip and my cowboy hat/.
Cause I'm about to spit, Indie—Anna Jones rap/.
Spitting Christina Aguilera rhymes/ cause their.
Beautiful, no matter what they say, every line/.
Lyrically murderous Dexter, kill tracks in a dark room/.
They Dexter too, but more like the Cartoon/.

Ain't here to Takeover.
or multiply/.
Or mutate, but wait's over, I'm playing this game/.
Playing the hand I'm dealt, giving a try/.
Ain't nothing else, cause the dealer knows my own name/.

If Ye' could do “All falls down” and “Jesus Walks” /.
Excuse me, if I go all balls out with Jesus talk/.
So if No I.D. can scratch Resurrection/.

Gold there is, rubies in abundance too but/.
Lips that speak knowledge and wisdom are a rare jewel son/.
Uni &amp; Hiphop are good fit settle in/.
Got this/ God blessed.
me with the 5th element/ knowledge/.
When people talk to God it's praying, but check it/.
But when God talks to people you call them schizophrenic/.
I'm out the ward, ready for Open Mic/ but when I.
Stroke it right, it opens up for me, hope there's.
“Life/ after Death”.
but don't pray hustler's prayer, I pray.
The Lord's/ God gave.
me rebirth, I cut my own cord/.
I found, once more/ these rappers flaw/ they got.
Swag, not righteousness, I'm swag backwards ‘Gaws'/.

Gotta hold down the block like a loose Lego piece/.
Cause these lil' kids stay high like a falsetto screech/.
Violence pervades from the malls to the streets/.
So I'm asking the Lord to lay me by a sweet meadow beach/.
I say I need someone to beat on/ I just need someone.
To lean on/ someone's love to feed from/ to see my seed spawn/.
But I sold my soul to God, won't ask for a refund' /.
I refuse to be a tall tree trunk for these dogs to pee on! /.
If I'm at my best when I'm a fighter, then I'll never have peace/.
But I'd rather spit truth than a clever ass tweet/.
Y'all wanna-be revolutionary, but ain't do shit/.
Never tutored the kids/ or move food with crews off the skids/.
All you do is make stupid excuses too quick/ til your.
Train of intuitions go swift chew chew off lucid grids/.
So about God's people and the game, I got many cares/.
Guess I gotta become the answer to my many prayers/.
