Behind Your Breath Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

Up, up and behind your breath.
Up, up, up.
Up, up and behind.
He up, up and behind your breath.
His face takes it's place behind what's left.
You wait for it but It will not come.
These things are hidden in the rest of the son.
Flatter yourself not.
All your noise come to naught.
Endless ending, endless collection of plagues.
Brought down on the median ground.
Up, up and behind your breath.
Up, up, up.
Scorch the earth, scorch the earth.
Ruined lives entire.
Of all the architects grand this ones the liar.
But my king, my king shows his hands.
Up, up and behind your breath.
Up, up, up.
Up, up and behind your breath.
Up, up, up.
A golden rod to measure the city.
The city, it's gates, it's walls.
Every breath here a call to prayer.
And we as, we as children there.
