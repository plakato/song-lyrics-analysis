Maximilianâ€™s Ring Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.


Impressions of a love
Two fool to care of the i for you
To concher up so symbol in your mind

We're. Getting wild. Haven'T you seen yourself
Lonely as i am lost in the clearest way

Confess. It'S you. Yourself
The lie the loyal over shines for you
And. No one else
A fool: a million mile

Because We're getting wild. Haven'T you seen yourself
Lonely as i am lost in the clearest way
We're getting wild? Haven'T you seen yourself
Lonely as i am lost in the clearest way x2

Fool to the smile
Have'nt, you heard enough
Remember maximilian's he use to sing
Remember maximilian's. The stainless ring

So we say thanks to him for everything
And, we go on together without a ring
And, we say
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
And. We say
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
And. We say
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
And. We say
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Thank you.
