An Open Letter To President Obama Lyrics
by Russell Simmons.

I listened to your speech last week at Rev.. Al Sharpton's, National Action
Network's, 20th anniversary dinner, talking among friends and close supporters.
This, was an annual African American dinner, a very important one.. While I know
that any Democrat would have fulfilled their promise to come back if they had
won the'08 election. I also know the significance and the special burden it
poses on you as the first African American President. At the same time, 
 
Still, I woke up the next day, feeling uneasy, not because you didn't take
issues, of direct significance to the black community head-on. --, like the fact
that one in three black children go to jail once in their lifetime or that
black people have an unemployment rate, double the amount of white people, -- 
but, because nowhere in your deep and thoughtful remarks did you talk about the
elephant in the room that affects All Americans, irrespective of color the
growing ranks of poor Americans, Americans struggling not just to meet their
mortgage payments but to eat sleep under a roof, educate their kids and pay
their basic bills. 
 
As, a passionate advocate of yours. Since I joined your campaign in 2008 there
is something you need to hear in trying to soar above party politics, you
risk, forgetting your most important commitment to inclusion and empowerment.
As. You prepare for your speech to the nation. Tomorrow night, I write this
letter to you as a friend and strong advocate. 
 
The rich are already at the table, as are the Democrats, the Republicans the
Tea Party and the unions, the business interests and the moneyed interests.
The poor can't afford for you to forget about them, and you cannot afford it
either. Of all Americans. The poor are not just the real victims of this
recession
