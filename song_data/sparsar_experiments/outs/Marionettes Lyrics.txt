Marionettes Lyrics
by The Zolas.

Sometimes an empire doesn't fall.
As masked invaders climb the walls.
Or spreading fires or rising floods.
Sometimes it dies within.
The king and queen, they go to bed.
On years of quiet neglect.
To find the coffers bare but with.
The musk of arrogance.

With me, you're making the same mistakes I made with you.
I couldn't convey I felt the same.

It's true, we're marionettes.
But we pull the strings.
And here as we dance, we tangle.
I'm spinning you round and closer we're wound.
We're marionettes.

There's comfort in a holding hand.
A schedule on which you depend.
A cage in which you're snugly penned.
That's what we have become.
A cyclone in a glass of wine.
We both have wishbones for a spine.
But how long will we play this record's tattered side.
Afraid to change the song?
