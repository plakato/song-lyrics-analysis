Baby It's Real Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

My love is real. My love is real
This thing. I feel baby, it's real
Something inside said. I can't hide
Baby it's real. I know I know it's real

I work, my fingers down to the bone
And with these hands. I build you. A home
My love is strong stronger than Rome
Oh baby. It'S real! Oh yes, I know it's real

My friends all say that I'm a fool
But! I can't stand my friend's ridicule
Because, it's real! Oh the way I feel
Yes baby, it's real
I know. I know I know. I know it's real

Sure, as the sun shine in the sky
My love, for you will never never never never die
And. If you feel the way that I feel
Baby. Oh it's real. I know I know I know it's real

And if you feel oh, oh, the way that I feel
Baby it's real. Oh yes, it's real!
