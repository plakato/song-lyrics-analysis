John Stockton Lyrics
by ZOOpfish.


Yeah.
Uh.
12.
Zϴϴ.
Got Magic like Johnson.
I'm Jazzing like Stockton.
Got Magic like Johnson.
I'm Jazzing like Stockton.
Got Magic like Johnson.
I'm Jazzing like Stockton.
Yo, yo, aye.
Let's get it popping.

White Iverson, Y'all ain't hanging one on one.
You should bring your friends along, double team, is what I want.
Wilt chamberlain, swear I'm all these bitches want.
O Robertson, getting bucks im number one.

She want that 12 play.
AI call it Stockton.
I'm swagging, I'm passing, i'm jazzing, I'm popping.
Imma post this Malone, but the mailman can drop it.
No toro, no Rodman. Carajo, que pasa.
No she love when I drive by.
Got her on the line like free throws.
So text your man and say bye bye.
Send me 2 k's that's cheat code.
And she knows, yeah she knows.
I stay on her mind like headbands.
Need a girl that likes champagne.
And still ain't afraid to do keg stands.
Legs and dream list long.
Cross you outta that miffed thong.
She gets Impatient.
Give her d 03, 4 Pistons.
And letters take to long.
So don't Wright-McCall.
And We'll keep it bouncing, Love and Basketball.

Refrain.
Said I swear this shits a layup *4.

Man I ball like Jordan, no balding.
Hand me the mic I rock that, no Spalding.
Don't think I'm an Artest, we brawling.
Ya fakers don't pass though, Cliff Pauling.
Said I swear I got it locked.
I be, Kyrie with rock.
And this new shit just don't stop.
And this zoo shit just don't stop.
I got new shit it's so hot.
You got oldies greggy pops.
Game ready, ready stop.
In my lane get it right, get it right.
Yeah.

Refrain.

Damn, life's a beach, I stay higher than a seagull.
NO, like the Pelicans I just don't believe you.
Zϴϴ's on top of the west and the east dude.
Whole team fucking, Rick Pitino.
Middle like a C-note.
Hit it then I reload, Backboard beast mode.
Break it like I'm Shaq.
Nahhh.... I'll just lay it off the glass.

Refrain.

Swear I always dress fly, fresh as Russell Westbrook.
I might hit up Brooklyn, see bout how the nets look.
Say what's up to Erin, see how hot her friends look.
P to the f-i, also known as one take.
Put it in the air, like you biting on a pump fake.
That shit a blow out, my team? we that great.
J gon' get the rebound, hit me on the fast break.
