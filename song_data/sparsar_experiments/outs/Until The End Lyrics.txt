Until The End Lyrics
by Sydney.

Well I crept up the pavement all covered in blood.
And I knew what the wave meant, it started this flood.
My inability to socialize is breaking in two.
And now I finally realize I'm coming unglued.

So I'm letting you know, though you're not listening.
I'm letting you go, look to the northern sky.
I'll be there the rest of tonight, forever and all of your life.
I'll be there the rest of tonight, so sleep tight.

I've lost a lot of faith in people all around me.
Cause everybody's fake, It's always so astounding.
I'm constantly afraid of giving more than I need to someone who I crave.
When all they do is blind me.

So I'm letting you know, though you're not listening.
I'm letting you go, look to the northern sky.
I'll be there the rest of tonight, forever and all of your life.
I'll be there the rest of tonight.
We try!
I'll be there the rest of tonight, forever and all of your life.
I'll be there the rest of tonight, so sleep tight.

1, 2, 3... x3.

I can't forget your face all the things.
That were erased and it hurts so bad, still I try.

I'll be there the rest of tonight.
Forever and all of your life.
I'll be there the rest of tonight.
We try!

I'll be there the rest of tonight.
Forever and all of your life.
I'll be there the rest of tonight x2.
