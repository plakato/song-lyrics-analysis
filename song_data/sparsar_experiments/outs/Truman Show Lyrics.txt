Truman Show Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


Deceit and denial 
What you're looking for can't be found. 
Believe me, child 
No bookstore can help you now. 
It doesn't have to be loud. 
I happen to be up in your face. 
Most of the time won't even notice. Half the bullshit in the place, 
All the bad news in your home classrooms and malls 
And. Now a quick passage. Yall 
That. I picked up in a bathroom stall, 
 
Save, the music 
Erase, the evil 
Save, the children, 
Save, the people, 
Save the trees, 
Natures wealth 
Save. The world 
Save yourself, 
 
Better, safe than sorry 
Better late than never 
Want to get the props 
Better make the effort. 
Don'T fall in love with the pinup queen 
Stand right, walk, left, 
don't, swim upstream 
A to the E. I O? U 
Sometimes! It'S Y! When the I won't do 
Press 1 for blame 
Press 2 for proof 
But, you need to call this number. If you need the truth, 
 
We think that we see 
But. We don't see the half 
We think that we've learned 
But. We can't do the math 
We. Think that we know 
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go 
, 
We got ta cut. The bullshit 
And show the proof 
Rip the tree out of the ground. 
And expose the roots, 
Cause people love and found 
That. We won't improve 
Shit. They keep us held down 
As the chosen few 
Just sit, get rich 
What we're going through 
Cause 9-5 slaves slave for
these corporate fools, 
And try to deny and distort the rules. 
Inside our minds, build cages that force the youth 
In. The schools have been trained to ignore the truth, 
About the nature of the threat that approaches you 
Before, you take another test, 
Know the joke's on you. 
They only gave you the textbooks to mould your views, 
Having with your soul, confused 
Some people, don't believe they got us on the loose 
Runnin' around chasin' after golden shoes, 
Livin their whole lives doin. What they told you to 
 
If. I only knew what the way was 
What would I do 
If you knew what you knew could save us 
Would you try to 
Cause we're living in the Truman, Show 
There's a limit to what you can know. 
Shit it's different than what you've been told. 
You'Ve been sold second hand, human souls, 
 
We, think that we see 
When. We don't see the half 
We think that we've learned 
But. We can't do the math 
We, think that we know 
Let yourself go. Let yourself go. Let yourself go 
 
We, think that we see 
When. We don't see the half 
We think that we've learned 
But. We can't do the math 
We, think that we know 
Let yourself go. Let yourself go. Let yourself go
