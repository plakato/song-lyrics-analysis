Slow it Up Lyrics
by UNK.


Do it how you wan na slow it up, do the Matrix 
Do it, how you wanna-, do it do it, how you wan na slow it 
Do it how you wan na slow it up, do the Matrix 
Play with it play with it, play with it. ... 
 
Unk 
Yo yo 
Smoke mo' kush, I'm fucked up I bounce. Then I stop pop and I lean 
I'm on deck knahmean, DJ Unk. It goes like the weed 
You can bend yo' knees, then rock yo' hips, and do it a lil', slow, 
Now freeze. I think I'm straight: let's roll 
They do it on they tiptoes snap yo' fingers as the beat goes 
 { You-you can Screw it }. You can Screw it slow. It up now check that hoe 
Now bring it back. Now. Do yo' thang, 
It's, Big Ooomp, bitch. Southern style, it ain't, gon' change 
You can blow that hazzzzzee high. Like you in space 
Montay on that bass, I speak that shit that make you rock away. 
It'S DJ Unk slow it up, shorty known for actin a donkey 
You can do it how you wan na, but it's got ta, be funky yup, 
 
Unk 
Okay. Soon, as I hit the stage, they seem amazed, 
Diamonds glistenin, with the Gucci shades 
Lean to the left. While I smoke the haze 
Nigga please~, I'm gettin paid 
Get like me, wan na, be like me, slow it up, sip some Hennessy 
Smoke, some kush is you feelin me Montay. Make me another beat 
I rock the club, then I'ma rock the streets, Bread Street down at V-103 
Dirty Boys J. Nitti, C.T. Club, Chocolate, Hershey 
By, the tap yep, the Blue Flame, Magic City. Let'S get it mayne, 
Play wit deez straight, get it mayne. Do it how you wan na I'ma, make it rain, 
Red or blue pop you one slow it up. Nigga have some fun. 
You can bounce. You can lean. It'S all on you. However, it seems 
A-T-L watch me. Do it slow it up, let's get into it. 
Big Oomp Records know how we do it burn it down now, go and Screw it
