Doing My Job Lyrics
by Quillz.


I work a 9 to 5 to maintain to stay alive/.
Thought of pushing pies till some of my homies died/.
They was on grind cause they needed a couple dollas/.
Fell victim to another nigga that was on the rise/.
Tired of getting by.. Shit for the birds/.
Working check to check pushing a nigga nerves/.
Over the past year a bunch of bs occurred/.
Had a nigga feeling like that's what I deserved/.
People in the street think that I fell off/.
Nigga had a good run then he was gone/.
He ain't drop a video or song in so long/.
I'm still grinding but know its allot going on/.
Wan focus on my dreams but busy being awoke/.
It pay to make a way can't afford to be broke/.
I'm a be gone for a minute due to my circumstance/.
So right now at the time try to understand.

A nigga 22.. Still living w/ mom dukes/.
I know she wan me gon I wan be gone too/.
Got the right ambitions but not enough loot/.
Probably could a been left if I ain't cop so many shoes/.
Or buy dumb shit I never really needed/.
It wasn't till my money slowed I start seeing/.
I set goals to things that wasn't as important/.
But I came nothing so admit I lost it/.
I was suppose to move down south to better me/.
Guess God had something different planned for me/.
I got knocked down thinkn damn this can't be/.
Felt like I was riding dolo all on my lonely/.
Come to find out people wan me go to far/.
Telling me soon enough I'll be a star/.
They got faith in me so can't let them down/.
But till straight again know that I'm still around/.
