Not Guilty Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.


I ain't guilty my nigga.
I ain't guilty.
These thoughts might be filthy.
But nigga I ain't guilty.
I ain't guilty my nigga.
I ain't guilty.
Don't put me behind bars cause nigga I ain't guilty..

I'm too blunt when I'm in these blunts.
I'm wit my dogs fucking bitches.
And I'm stuntin on cunts.
I'm a god, compare me to Jesus peace.
She want a piece of Jesus.
But there is danger in his peace.
Materialistic wealth.
Creept up on us like stealth.
Look within yourself.
So you can seek the truth.
Open your third eye as eye brows the web for truth.
I ain't guilt compare me to Zimmerman nigga.
Pardon my sarcasm but I'm killing you niggas.
For the figures and I wouldn't mind fucking gold diggers .. Uhh.

Where should I start.
I really got too much to tell.
Should I drive past my past.
Or drink from this fountain to propel.
To the future who are you ta judge me?
How the fuck you got an opinion with no money?
Uhh, You selling Knicks my nigga.
Spike lee.
But N.igga I. K.ill E.everything.
That's word to N.I.K.E.
I just do it wit these acronyms.
I'm so loyal to my niggas I'on't act on em.
N.W.M the motto, The Family.
Blow cookin Blow.
But I'm trying win the lottery.
Caesar didn't have a cagier.
Cassius boxed him in.
So i want my moms to be proud of me.
As she watch me win Uhh.
I ain't Guilty . . . T' Lo.
