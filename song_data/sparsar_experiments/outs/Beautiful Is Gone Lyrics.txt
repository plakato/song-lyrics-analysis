Beautiful Is Gone Lyrics
by Ruse.

Our love has come so far, but not at all.
I remember the start you can?t recall.
By the time it was right, you didn?t want to fall.
If it?s over, say it?s over....

Blindly, I let you destroy me!
Love is not so beautiful when your lungs are caving in.
And beautiful's gone!
Oh don?t lie to me when we both know baby.
Beautiful is gone....
Beautiful's gone!

And I pushed you so hard but not at all.
You closed your eyes.
I could see it all.
Run out the door, see no more of you.
And what you do.

Blindly, I let you destroy me!
Love is not so beautiful when your lungs are caving in.
And beautiful's gone!
Oh don?t lie to me when we both know baby.
Beautiful is gone!

Beautiful's gone!
Beautiful's gone!

What?s in store now that you have shut the door?
Peek in through the open crack.
I can?t keep from crawling back for more.
Crawling back for more....

Say its over, if it?s over....

Blindly, I let you destroy me.
Love is not so beautiful when your lungs are caving in.
And beautiful's gone!
Oh don?t lie to me when we both know baby.
Beautiful is gone!
Beautiful is gone!
Beautiful is gone!
Beautiful is gone!
Gone!
