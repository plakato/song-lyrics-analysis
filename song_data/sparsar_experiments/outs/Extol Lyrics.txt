Extol Lyrics
by Wolfgun.

The morning brings with it the song of birds.
The light of life.
The voice of calm belief.
And when it falls beneath the mountaintops.
It will still return.
If we stay and let it be.

So now that you're gone.
The stars are all that carry me.
But you are not far.
I can hear your voice call my name.

As long as stars show up when day is gone.
I can see it all.
Nothing hides beneath their light.
There are no shadows, and no secrets.
Everything is clear.
And the truth will shine out bright.

So I am not lost.
The warmth of life is everywhere.
And even in darkness.
The sun will rise on this day.
And I will know only joy.
