Cosmonaut Lyrics
by Wrathschild.


I was but a castaway infidecimal 
Particle floated far away. 
I forgot how to feel. I feel I feel 
May the force be with me to live another day. 
I lost my leg, which woke up savage 
Might as well, not have a name 
Till. I heard you till. I heard you 
Boomin' through the clouds and sayin' 
 
Take me home me, 
Been, so lonely 
So, don't ever let me go 
 
Interlude 
And the sky opened up before my eyes. 
And everything went up in flames 
And as the old world burned away. 
I realized that everything before had been a lie: 
 
Ohhh, cosmonaut 
All, the love that I want 
All, the love that I need. 
Is waiting in your arms, 
Ohhh cosmonaut 
I waited so long, 
For a traveler to come. 
And. Take me to the stars: 
 
Take, you! Where you wan na go 
Anywhere you wan na go, I'm yours, 
You can be my deity. I can be your DMT 
If. You only come with me. 
Accessory experiment never be the same again. 
Light, the sky as you levitate 
Oh, what's to serve for your escape 
 
Take me home me 
Been, so lonely 
So! Don'T ever let me go 
Take! You hold you 
Need to know you 
I won't ever let you go 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 
Oh and I've just woken up. 
It'S, the first time I've been more than dust 
The light runs through me in the aftershow 
I resurrect, with your touch 
I've been dying for this kind of rush. 
Your light runs through me. I can't get enough 
 
Oh, oh oh, oh cosmonau-au-au-aut, 
All, the love that I want 
All, the love that I need 
Is waiting in your ar-ar-ar-arms 
Oh, oh, oh, oh cosmonau-au-au-aut, 
I waited so waited so waited so long. 
Now. Take me to the star-ar-ar-ars
