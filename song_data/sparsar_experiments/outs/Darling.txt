Darling
by Pure Bathing Culture.


Pitch the light you turn it over
Switch to mind before leave clover
Find the right in him and others
Time will bring the best
Never. Am i the best and tending
First the beginning? Then the ending
Just pretend it's never ending
Time will bring the best darling, save us
We're in danger
All and all in a day take it away all in a day
Take it away
When the light of less intention
Is. Never spoken is never mentioned
Never. Will i remember
Time will bring the best
Darling save us
We're in danger
All and all in a day take it away all in a day
Take. It away
All in a day
Take it away
All in a day
