Rose in the Ghetto Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


Since the day she was born.
She was often told she was beautiful.
Didn't understand why Mommy told her.
No, take that ribbon out your hair that we can't afford..
To make it as a star is all she waits for.
A blanket in the car is all she call home.
Don't wanna live here anymore.
By the time she was 12 years old.
Pops got close, took all their dough.
Now baby gotta do the only thing she know.
Begging kids for the clothes.
They don't wear no more.
And everybody know.
So she can't be cool.
Rumors goin' 'round at school.
Ma, please don't make me go there anymore.

Who﻿ said that a rose can't grow in the ghetto?
Believe it or not.
I promise the sun don't only shine in the meadows.
You do what you got til.
You got it and you're gone.
Cause oooh child.
Things is going to get easier.
Oooh child.
Things'll be brighter.

Sixteen and she still a child.
She tryna be grown and she acting wild.
Body like a model and killer smile.
Getting love from dudes.
The only way she knows how.
She's thinking to herself.
There's gotta be more than cutting on a Lexus floor.
Mama, don't guys fall in love anymore?
She waking up dizzy at 3:00 and 4:00.
She's scared to tell her mom.
So she can't abort.
Everybody she done been with slams the door.
She's down low until the day it's born.
But she ain't gonna cry for nothing that spilled ?
And ain't nobody love the way this kid will.

I got a rose of my own.
Who said﻿ that a﻿ rose can't grow in the ghetto?
Believe it or not.
I promise the sun don't only shine in the meadows.
You do what you got til you got it and you're gone.
Cause, oooh child.
Things is going to get easier.
Oooh child.
Things'll be brighter.
