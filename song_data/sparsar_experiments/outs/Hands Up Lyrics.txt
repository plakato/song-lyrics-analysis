Hands Up Lyrics
by Yung Malik.

Hands Up.

We shutin it down so just put ya hands up.
You Know I ain't readin no comics.
Bang bang its a prime time player.
Ballin im jordan im betta than.
That prime time player 6 rings.
Last year best year coke boy.
Bryc yo shot of I ain't no.
Joke my homies fetti gang.
You know my name hit me up any concerns.
You know we puttin our hand up wea dah.
Cash at Im barry bonds when Im at bat.
The Fans put they hands up.
