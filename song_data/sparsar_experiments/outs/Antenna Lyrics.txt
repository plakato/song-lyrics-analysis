Antenna Lyrics
by Zion I.

Sometimes I feel down and lonely.
And I can't carry on.
When I.
Makes me wanna carry on.
Makes me feel brand new.
Make me feel brand new.

Every breath is a prayer.
We still livin.
World still spinnin.
I'm still thanks givin.
Trying to get it right.
But I'm left here trippin.

Make me feel brand new.

Used to feel a lil better.
Bout the garden im tendin.
Weeds in my life.
Enemies I befriended.
Feels hella heavy.
Please don't get offended.

Make me feel brand new.

Got jealousy and envy.
Round every corner.
Suckas pop.
But I know they don't want it.
Smile in my face.
But I know it ain't cool.

Make me feel brand new.

I ask you to forgive em.
In this world of sin.
We all need a little love.
Where to begin.
Was a child now a man.
You my bestest friend.
Unseen but you feel like my next of kin.

Talk to you through my antenna) x2.

WIsh I could come home.
Talk face to face.
3rd rock from the sun.
Drift through space.
Spinnin like an angel.
With a dirty face.

Make me feel brand new.

Like the world turn quicker.
With every drag clicker.
Hand on the post.
One eye on the ticker.
When the last trumpet sound.
What the hell we supposed to do.

Make me feel brand new.

Greenhouse in effect.
So the globe get hotter.
Third world villages.
Can't find water.
Sons get the sins.
Passed down from the father.

Make me feel brand new.

I wouldn't ask you the question.
To save us all.
But I bask in your blessing.
The pain is raw.
We were cut from your cord.
When we took the fall.
So when I'm lost in the sauce.
Help me find the shore.

Talk to you through my antenna).
