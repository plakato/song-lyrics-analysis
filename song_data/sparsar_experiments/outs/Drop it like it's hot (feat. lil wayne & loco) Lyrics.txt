Drop it like it's hot (feat. lil wayne & loco) Lyrics
by Yung Berg.


It'S so hard for me to sit back here in this studio 
Looking at a guy out here, hollering my name 
When. Last year I spent more money on spilt liquor, 
In bars from one side of this world to the other than you made 
You're talking to the Rolex wearing diamond ring wearing kiss stealing
 
Wheeling dealing Limousine riding Jet Flying son of a gun, 
 
, Meek Mill,
