Stardust Lyrics
by Xandria.

This is my last transmission, my final salutation.
I count down to ignition, one last time I´m rising.
The stars are all I think of, for me it's never enough.
Their cold bliss is my resource to find myself.

I´m yearning, I´m longing, I´m waiting to go.

Back to where the skies will ever take me.
Down here in this prison I´ll be breaking.
Far from here there is a place where I belong.
I go home.

This great black nothing calls me.
An echo of the voices from where I have been traveling.
In exile I´m living.
Infinite silence waiting for me with all its answers.
A lightless mirror blazing oh with truth so pure.

Oh if you could see how.
How small everything seems from here.
So trivial, so shallow.
The meaningless drama so precious on earth.
Seen from the timeless stardust.

I´m flying, I´m drifting, I´m dying so please let me go back…

Now I´ll be returning home.
To the stars eternally.
