Swag trap Lyrics
by Yung Kilo.

All these young rappers dying at a early age speaker knockers dead and gone.
and he was only nineteen my nigga lil snupe he forever lives in me because.
without him I really wouldn't had turntable out to be what I wanted to be I.
get on Facebook every single night and post a new rap post but people don't.
appreciate things so I stopped doing the most grew out of ADHD the schools.
thought I was crazy pimpernel at a early age getting rejected by the ladies.
yeah you can call it whatever you want you can even say that they dissed me.
but I'm at the top of my game and I bet they crying and they miss me but all.
my haters here today I want you to know you can appreciate because I give you.
credit for what your doing I mention you in my songs everyday yeah I might not.
grew up fancy like Michael Jackson Oprah Winfrey and like this I used to be.
dead broke but I'm out here representing because I'm gone die hood rich.
