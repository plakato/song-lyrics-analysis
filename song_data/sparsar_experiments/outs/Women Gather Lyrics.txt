Women Gather Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

He was her only child, her baby boy 
She was his second daughter, a father's pride and joy 
Somebody's mother brother, best friend, sister lover, 
Maybe, an A-1 student running hiding taking cover 
 
The women gather crying tears that fill a million oceans. 
It doesn't matter where you're living 
The women gather crying tears that fill a million oceans. 
It doesn't matter where you're living, 
The women gather, 
 
People, say Not in this neighborhood 
It doesn't happen here. 
Our kids have everything 
What. Do we have to fear 
But? What about the ones who say This happens every day?
