Be Free Lyrics
by Rusko.

Long time ago, long time ago.
From the country to the town.
From the soul to the crowd, woo, woo, oh, oh, oh.
From the country to the town.
From the soul to the crowd, woo, woo.

Set me, let me free, I'm locked up in the beat.
The poetry, the flow-etry? I'm locked up in the beat.
With the microphone I'm in the zone, I'm locked up in the beat.
Expression, that's the key, I'm locked up in the beat.

Come set me, let me free, I'm locked up in the beat.

The poetry, the flow-etry? I'm locked up in the beat.
When Million Dan gets into the zone, I'm locked up in the beat.
Expression, that's the key, I'm locked up in the beat.

I and I must be free, that's what I see as my destiny.
Love is what will set me free, make us friends from our enemies.
So I and I just let things be, forgive me for what I've done to thee.
Is forgiving what you've done to me.

Come set me, let me free, I'm locked up in the beat.
The poetry, the flow-etry? I'm locked up in the beat.
With the microphone I'm in the zone, I'm locked up in the beat.
Expression, thats the key, I'm locked up in the beat.

Come set me, let me free, I'm locked up in the beat.

The poetry, the flow-etry? I'm locked up in the beat.
When Million Dan gets into the zone, I'm locked up in the beat.
Expression, thats the key, I'm locked up in the beat.

Long time ago, long time ago, long time ago.

I and I must be free, that's what I see as my destiny.
Love is what will set me free, make us friends from our enemies.
So I and I just let things be, forgive me for what I've done to thee.
Is forgiving what you've done to me.
