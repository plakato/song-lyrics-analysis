Reload Lyrics

Produced by DJ Zinc.

Kick goes boom, we like to jump.
Kick goes boom, we like to jump.
Kick goes boom, we like to jump.
We like to jump, we like to jump.

We like to jump, we like to jump.
We like to jump, we like to jump.
We like to jump, we like to jump.
We like to jump, we like to jump.
We like to jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

Who is that? P, reload.
P, I beat the, P, reload.
P, I beat the, P, reload.
Bounce around and shout reload.
It's easy, I've got em begging for a reload.
Selecta, bring the tune back, reload.
Hit em with the old school flow like.
Bam-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bam for the reload.

I beat the reload, next one.
P, I'm colder, reload, next one.
Reload, next, one.
Reload, next one.
I get too many reloads, I don't read loads.
This ain't a lyric, I just get a reload with the next one.
What did he say? That's the next one.
What did he say? That's the next one.

I heard this like wow, let me MC.
Now I'm featuring on the track as the MC.
They don't wanna book me, now I'm fully booked up.
Man've got em begging me, please, please, MC.
There ain't an MC like this MC.
Cause I don't MC like these MCs.
Simple, perfect, you should've viewed.
Got the view on the view to  when I MC.
