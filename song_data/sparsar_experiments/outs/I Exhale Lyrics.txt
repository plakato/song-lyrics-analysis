I Exhale Lyrics
by Underworld.

Life, it's a touch.
Everything is golden.
Open, rider.
Stumble, catch.
Yeah.
Great, well.
Yeah.
You talk too fast.
The how-to one is.
Great.
December.
Monday morning.
Okay.
What you got?
Shiver and smile.

Studs like tiny stars.
Your shoes appear.
Sharp shadow.
Clean dirt.
Metal poles.
Statuesque.

Glass crown.
In a blue sky.
Asbestos roofs.
Corrugated rhythms.

Big blue.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Big blue.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

Spangled top.
Leather jacket.
Run your fingers through your hair.
We're nearly there.
Hiding in the dark.
Sheltered from the winds.
Hold hands.
In a doorway.
The crafty one.

Us.
Hopped up.
Hidden.
Flashing lights.
Look.
The lights.
One above every door.
Towers.

Clean cut.
White line.
Tell you how high.
Things are.
In the distance.
Good, look.
Too many jobs.
Knock on.
Inside out.
Two levels.
Rubble.
Smash it up.
Get it down.
Do as much as you can.
Step out, fresh.

A line of rocks.
Connected by red and white tape.
You're bigger than that.
Things start happening.
Mouths keep talking.
Sun low and cold.
I'm so great.

A light a glow.
Over the horizon.
I want to tell you everything.
Rhythm of consent.
Constant lips.
Sleeping.
Park it.
Cover it.
Tie it up.
Float it.
Chain it to a fence.
Tie stripey tape to it.
Put it on the roof.
Set fire to it.
Pile em up.

A light a glow.
Over the horizon.
A light a glow.
Over the horizon.
A light a glow.
Over the horizon.
