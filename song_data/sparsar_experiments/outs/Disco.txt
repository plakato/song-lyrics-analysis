Do you really think?
That life is only working...
When you are involved?

I put my legs up with out you.
Yes blood is flowing.
U know thats true, i will rip n chew u up.

So tell me sumthn i dnt no.
Il tell u 10 things u dnt no.

Fuck ur study group.
Fuck ur clubbing crew.

Na.

Been there before.
Ur in the wrong.
But i did ignore.
So tell me if i.
Ever belonged.

To this little rowdy group of yours.

What a lonely group of yours.
Im on my way home from yours.

Do you really think, that life is only working... When u r involved?

You tell me that life will stop with out you.
You tell me that life will stop with out you.
