Charge Lyrics
by Sway UK.


The beat keeps drumming on and on 
A billion charge, as one 
Tomorrow's just begun. 
The beat keeps drumming on and on 
To think we almost lost our faith in love. 
But. You just can't hide the sun 
Charge 
 
Staring at a blank canvas, 
Behind closed doors, no cameras, 
I've got to get my head down 
Move forward and never look backwards. 
Looking at the time and clearly 
That time is nearly here 
But are we prepared? 
You can sing along. If you hear me, 
Let's make it a day to remember, sing 
They think it's over. Then we go again 
All over the globe, they're doing it. How we do it 
And all over the map, we're clapping 
And. At least we can say we were there when it happened: 
 
Hopped off a messed up, mattress, 
No time for a rest, handcuffs 
Start over press reset 
And we're going all the way. No recess 
This year I'mma be a better me and 
That's a letter to myself forever me 
Positive energy. When I pick up a magazine 
Cause, that's the only time I'm looking at an enemy 
Let's make it a day to remember, sing, 
They! Think it's over then 
Everybody get to the core, the middle of it all 
When, it's up in the air we fly, not fall. 
The world is mine. The world is yours, 
We can share what we saw 
Here we go again we're in the zone again 
And. This is the climax to the whole event, 
Turn it up to a million and phone a friend 
So. We never feel cold again, go again 
All over the globe, they're doing it, how we do it 
And all over the map, we're clapping 
And. At least we can say we were there when it happened:
