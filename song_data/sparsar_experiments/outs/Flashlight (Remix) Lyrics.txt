Flashlight (Remix) Lyrics
by Syd tha Kyd.

Ohh ohh-ohh ohh-ohh-ohh, baby 
Ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh, 
, 
My heart, it's with you now 
But. Do you know how to love me? 
Your heart, it beats for me 
I'm. The only thing you got to hold onto 
My mind tells me to let you go 
But. My heart said no 
 
My. Mind tells me that this is wrong. 
But, your love's too strong 
And. Now I'm caught in the middle 
You took away my flashlight 
Now, I'm walking in the dark 
Thinking why'd. I even stop to think 
That. This could be love 
Is. It too late to turn back now, 
Now that I've, given you my heart, 
Before, this whole thing falls apart. 
But. Could this be love 
Could? This be love 
Could, this be love 
Could, this be love. 
 
Slow flow 
Uh come home with a attitude. Cuz your day was stressful, 
I, calm, your body down and fold your legs like a pretzel 
WWF in the bed. Like I'm wrestle, 
Cinnamon sugar, sweet Girl. I just wan na get it wet, so 
Submarine shift baby. You can ride my vessel 
Nipple on your nipple. Can I come and get a breastful 
Honestly? I like the way you feed me 
Looking at me like a book. I like the way you read me 
Niggas wan na, be me, but they can't even 
I'm committed seven days out the week. No cheating 
I feel like Steven Spielberg. The way we film our movie 
Sit back on the chair and watch little momma. Do me 
12 inches. No ruling we share 50-50 
She. Tell me I'm the one. Every time we gettin' busy 

Three times out the day and we're on our second session 
Yes 
 
You took away my flashlight 
Now, I'm walking in the dark 
Thinking why'd. I even stop to think 
That. This could be love 
Is, it too late to turn back now, 
Now that I've, given you my heart, 
Before, this whole thing falls apart. 
But. Could this be love 
Could? This be love 
Could, this be love 
Could. This be love, 
I'm, no longer safe. When you look my way, 
You've become my everything 
Is, this a mistake, 
 
Baby, when you put put that thing on me, 
I just can't explain. 
This is a mistake. 
 
And, I hate to be selfish, baby 
But. What about me 
If, you leave you, take it all! 
 
Nah! You know I wouldn't leave you baby. 
So, say you'll, be mine. 
Maybe, together we'll find 
The words that describe love 
If. What we both feel inside is love. 
 
You took away my flashlight 
Now, I'm walking in the dark 
Thinking why'd. I even stop 
To think that this could be love 
Is, it too late to turn back 
Now that I've. Given you my heart 
Before, this whole thing falls apart. 
But. Could this be love? Love 
Could, this be love 
Could. This be love, love, 
Could! This be love, Love, yeah
