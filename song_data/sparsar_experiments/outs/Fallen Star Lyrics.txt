Fallen Star Lyrics
by Un-Ez.


Eyo! drug cocaine cocaina I'll explain.
It came from a marina.
In a villa out in spain.
Yo ship it out in boat if not.
Fuck it.
Load up some planes.
One arrive like a needle.
The other slow like a flame.
Lets get this money baby.
Lets get them for all they change.
Lets get them from afar.
Lets get them closer in range.
Run the whole cartel.
Drug game.
Through they veins.
Distribute through the wild.
The ones that should've been kings.
Leave the precious mindless.
Kurt cobain.
All around us.
It be the same Ol' thing.
Cause I remember Jazz I remember Jazz.
He was a good dude.
He was a teacher in the past.
He made it out the ghetto man.
He slipped through the cracks.
Flirted with some dope then he slipped right back.
Wife kids and crib.
You can say he had it all.
Now remembered by his flaws.
So i spit this shit raw nigga.

Waking up in cold sweats.
Haunted by so much trauma.
He could still hear the shots.
Penetrating all type of armor.
But he did it for his honor his mama.
His native land and Obama.
Trained to shoot anyone who looks.
Like Osama.
While he was out there.
Fighting to keep us free.
His wife in Tennesse.
Committing adultery.
Creeping around like she was trained by the vietnamese.
Now he gotta fight off devils that are tempting him to squeeze.
Lord!
He's thinking murder.
Murder might be the remedy.
But war is different.
When you in love with the enemy.
He wants to work it out.
She hiding lies like claymores.
This ain't the girl that Bruno Mars.
Said catch grenades for.
Her heart is rotten.
I want my divorce.
And I ain't bluffing at least you don't have to worry about who I'm fucking.
I'll go nuclear if you dare to push one of my buttons.
He put one in his head.
For a bitch worth nothing.
