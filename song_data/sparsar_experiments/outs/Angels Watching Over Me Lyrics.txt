Angels Watching Over Me Lyrics
by Virtue.

Vs1 They encamp all around me/ 
So. I have no fear/ 
They. Tell me He loves me/ 
Whisper in my ear/ 
It means the world to me. 
To have them near/. 
These are my angels over me, 
 
Vs2. They come from the throne, above/ 
And, before His face/ 
They carry the light of Love/ 
Cover me with grace/ 
They wan na to see me/ 
Complete. This race/ 
These are my angels over me, 
 
Chrorus. I got angels watching over me. 
I got angels watching over me. 
I got angels watching over me, 
Angels over me, 
 
Vs3. They silently hold me/ 
With their mighty wings/ 
When. I cry the console: me/ 
With, the songs they sing/ 
When. I sleep they watch over me/ 
Fan away. Evil. Things/ 
These are my angels. Over me, 
 
Vs4 Said we don't even notice/ 
The protection, they give/ 
Fell as asleep on the road and yet/ 
I continued to live/ 
Sometimes. I even wished that they 
Wouldn't answer my call/ 
But, unwavering angels/ 
They. Just won't. Let me fall/
