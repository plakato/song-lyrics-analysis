The Wrekless Motto Lyrics
by Wrekless.


Wrekless bitch 
 
Rockstar tune on the moon 
Moonwalking right now, while sleeping in a tomb. Woah 
Watch me lean on a scale to see the scalene 
Forty racks will guarantee your lady ball for our team 
It's a paradox: I'm unorthodox 
Crisco unleash the dragon.
