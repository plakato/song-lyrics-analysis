Best Believe Lyrics
by 3pac.


Let me tell you a story about a kid with a dream.
Yo, he thought to himself and hes known to do his thing.
People never understood the visions that he had.
His mom and his dad would often get mad and sorry 'I'm sorry son but you're.
living in a pop dream, you gotta get in touch with reality'.
But he never listened, always kept on the grind.
Live from the lab, putting in time.
Still going to school but never knew why.
Sometimes he would leave early just to get high, took the stress off his mind.

Listen to a new beat, each week on the web conquering new feats.
But never satisfied by where is was at.
Always hungry for more so he never stopped pumping out the tracks.
Giving the haters something they can attack.
But its all good cause he all got him on the map.
And I'm telling you this story cause this is about me.
I want ya'll to know who I'd rather be.
A kid with a dream something like Martin Luther King.
2013, I'm still doing my thing.
Just getting started, I'm showing ya'll nothing.
Like true colours smoke coming out of the oven.
Hot flows, giving ya'll something y'all be loving.
Heading to the top, you best believe.
