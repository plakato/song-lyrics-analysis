Anonymous Lyrics
by Xander Ghost.


No vice, would you love me if i got more ice?
Would you love me if i told no lies.
Bitch i'm kinda new in the city.
I'm wearing linen, cuz am sweaty from the heat.
That the blogs are giving.
Come here massage my feet, ya that's how i'm living.
You still looking for the long way, the long way home.

Waiting till the rainbow's back you know i try to cope like a single dad.
I know you like to smoke till your lungs go black.
Now you counting days like you playing black jack.

You are anonymous x4.

Lo-fi am i your robot i feel computerised my clothes are budget but i got.
More style.
Bitch you dirty dancing to a milli, you playing villain i guess you sweaty.
From the heat naa i guess you winning you got it all under your feet, fuck.
That was a lyric.

You still looking for the long way, the long way home.

Waiting till the rainbow's back you know i try to cope like a single dad.
I know you like to smoke till your lungs go black.
Now you counting days like you playing black jack.

You are anonymous x4.
