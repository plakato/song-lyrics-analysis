Sterling Moss Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Wait i should've know by now.

I should've gone to sleep but had to move.

Cool breeze from such a great ocean.

Comfort in confronting something so huge.

If one works hard you're doomed to be gone.

It's alright autumn brings me down it makes me crumble in my heart.

But if i pull through then i'll still have to face myself.

Gone's unseparation this pointed worthless wisdom.

Confuses you one worthless heart is screwed.

Till it falls apart on you.

It's gone.

I'm saving as payment.

This worthless fucking doubt.
