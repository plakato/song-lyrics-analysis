Alone Lyrics
by P.U.R.P..

Alone, oh oh

And, fenna smash
Once. I get paid
Golden cross
But shit just be fake
Got. This noise ring
Ain't no doubt
Imma, take your chick
Im high fuck right, now
I rock gold, chains
Imma fucking enjoy
To just get to the joint
And. Leave you as her X-men
Turn, an earthist to christian
I`ll, be fucking horny
Yeahx4
I`ll, be fucking. Boning
Huh
So, please alonex3
That alcohol. Just keep pouring
Im high as fuck
I was puffing dink right, now
Im forever be a patient
The coloreds, say: im slacks man
Can`t! You see im in zone
Guess what niggas going to a party
My sneaker game
Im worivene. You call me hughman
I`ll, be fucking on it
Hate being lonely for over 2 hours

 Gim me that guap, maybe i might have that power
That. We fuckecho
And these fake niggas be boring
Before. You know it
And these dope hoes
Everybody know my clique
I do rap cause. I love it
Im too sick
So holy
On point
And fucking smashing these hotties
Before. You know it
Cause his oddy
Paidx4
And, we high
Everybody know my boy
But I'mma get real chains
And. You know it
Everybody know my clique
Now call that chris-chain
And craving for a fucken shawty
Got adidas on feet
These dope, kush that we smokeecho
And fucking dodging the police
Thats. My passion
My girl, buzzing phone im, bitch alone

And smoking. Getting this shawtys
Yung hustle fam, be my team
Before. You know it
And these bad bitches be twerking
And. These gold chains
Huh
All, i need, is cash
Im stuggy with my beats

6pm and im so drunk
We swag dope,
