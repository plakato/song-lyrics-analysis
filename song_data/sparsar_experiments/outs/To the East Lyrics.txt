To the East Lyrics
by X-Clan.


Sir Jinx.

Yes,yes.
To the east my brother to the east x4.
The revival of the raw.
To the east my brother to the east x4.
Sir Jinx and.
Brother J y'all.
Graveyard shift.
Come on, break it down.
To the east my brother to the east.
The revival of the raw.

Bother J.

I be the sweet tongue assassin.
The unraveller.
Ballistic manifest.
Three fifty-seven caliber.
The spectacular, vibrations grabbing your.
Body and soul ?
While I'm stabbing these hostile verb braggers.
Like Cyclops, with more lip control than Mic Jagger.
X factor, witness the mic control bagger.
Fiddle game of tag.
Make haste with spook, blacker.
? out slackers when I put your slang tones.
Patchwork brother how'd his crews end up sown.
Brother of the zone speakers.
Their minds blown.
Evolution seeds knowledge.
We home grown.
Smoke out the crater of your crew's lost skulls.
Devils annul.
Slick tongue make swords dull.
J be the God while you fools talk the bull.
Born to build worlds with my universal pull.
I want action, baby.
? that mediocre play.
My treasure dialog make your record sour your ways.
Triple six killer perfecting a demon slay.
Step up in my cipher.
Reflect my solar rays.
Where we headed?

Brother J.

To the east teaching God to be.
Now yes, yes y'all were laying groove for storm.
A come on in now.
To the east teaching Gods to be.
Now what is was what it is and again shall be.
Now where we headed?
To the east teaching Gods to be.
Now yes, yes y'all let's sing groove for Ra.
Now cone on in, ah.
To the east teaching Gods to be.
The revival of the raw.

My double cobras reach my crown.
Son, I bless this mic.
And broadcast from wise zone.
With the frequencies of life.
My evolution seeds blossom to sweet fruit.
Black boot squash ? execute.
Futuristic style that still sport the basics.
Fools that trace this.
Lost in space in my matrix.
Torn the basis.
Now my verbs complete.
Throughout you lunar year.
Seven days, fifty-two weeks.
Clubs to the streets, valleys to mountain peaks.
Master builder, architect enough heat.
Rappers to the east have come to set the peace.
So these grimy M.C.s, don't hope to test me.
Where we headed?
