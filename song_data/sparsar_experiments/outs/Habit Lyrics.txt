Habit Lyrics
by Volume.

Here I am.
I'm stretched out on the floor.
Crawling to you baby.
Always wanting more.

Burned out candles spinning.
Black light blackout.
Crawling to you baby.
Always wanting more.

Give me, give me, give me what I want.
Give me, give me, give me what I need.
Give me, give me, give me what I want.
Give me, give me, give me what I need.

Give me another.
I can't see through this smoke.

Dirty walls, and a dirty floor.
Nothing matters, nothing matters.
Crawling to you daily.
This habit has got to go.

Give me, give me, give me what I want.
Give me, give me, give me what I need.
Give me, give me, give me what I want.
Give me, give me, give me what I need.

Give me, give me, give me what I want.
Give me, give me, give me what I need.
Give me, give me, give me what I want.
Give me, give me, give me what I need.

Round 'n' round, staying low.
Another time inside down.
Come up to me again and again.
Get off my ride.
Dream tripping, star bound.
Never coming down.
My heart, your lungs.
Coughing, dying free.
Drive, drive me baby.
Slowly you rise.
Round 'n' round you fall.
Get off my ride.
Dream tripping, star bound.
Never coming down.
