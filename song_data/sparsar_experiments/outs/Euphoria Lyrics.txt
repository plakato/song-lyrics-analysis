Euphoria Lyrics
by Xandria.

Serpent angel rape me 
Serpent venom in me, 
 
O Euphoria, our goddess. You are 
Take the burden away to live in this hell. 
Say goodbye to the dreams destroyed fantasies, 
Bitter nightfall at hand will cover the land 
Forces come-silent 
Cross, your mind-blinding 
Anaesthesize-senses 
Steal them all away. 
Caress you-grievous 
Infest, you-with, lust 
Ending soon-chaos 
Servant life is waiting, 
 
Childish, dream-sinful 
I have seen-passion 
Fearlessly-chainless 
All. This hope is forever lost. 
 
O Euphoria, our goddess. You are 
Take the burden away to live in this hell, 
Say goodbye to the dreams destroyed fantasies, 
Bitter nightfall. At hand will cover the land 
Neverworld's End 
We, sell you a false dream for your own 
So. We can control your fantasies. 
There'S no hideaway this world is ours. 
Give in to our plastic, paradise 
Endlessly travelling the plains of my dream, 
Slowly, it's fading in my memory. 
 
O Euphoria, our goddess, you are 
Take the burden away to live in this hell. 
Say goodbye to the dreams destroyed fantasies, 
Bitter nightfall at hand will cover the land. 
O Euphoria. Sweet lies that you are 
Let. The child fade away. Just memories stay 
O, Chimaria, predacious, heart 
Take; our souls with you Forever repent, 
Neverworld's, End
