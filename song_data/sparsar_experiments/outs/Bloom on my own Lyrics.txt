Bloom on my own Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


Like a withered rose in the rain I'd fall apart.
Down to your feet again.
Pricked from all the thorns, your blood was the only thing feeding the garden.
Always seemed so carefree, but, now you're gone.
I can't see.

Roses in the spring bloomed, everything died too soon.
Cut away all the pain.

You could never feel me, you don't want to anyway.
I know I'd just hurt you, I think about it everyday.
Love never lasts, even to your own, it's never unconditional.
Devoured all your power, I am not a flower.
You're not my creator.

See we sunk in too soon guided by the blue moon, drowning in the red sea.
Listen to the crows in the sky scream for help as they die inside the trees.
