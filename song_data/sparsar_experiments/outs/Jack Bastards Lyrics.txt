Jack Bastards Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


You never know where niggas may go.
And she love a nigga spirit like she Kayko.
We muy caliente, spitting fuego.
Tour life.
Me and my niggas cruisin' in a Winnebago.
We making pay rolls.
And that's the main goal.
See it all in the near future.
I'm Mario super.
The way I jump on to competition heads.
Like they're Koopa Troopas.
Activate my boosters.
I be the bees knees.
Giving 16s for free.
I'mma sick teen I sneeze.
Do as I please.
I mean geez louise.
Travel the seven seas.
To seize everything within the reach.
Of this group of ill teens....
I had to take a break now I'm back at.
I'm not asthmatic.
But I need some inhalers.
Like one these fast rappers.
My nigga, my flows sweet.
And yours is like the candy wrapper.
Elevate my mind and expand my brain matter.
In a matter of seconds my mind is weapon.
But I'll still come strapped wit a Smith&amp;Weston.
To ya intersection.
That's if I'm feeling threaten.
Man I got a method to this madness.
Late night love affairs with a California actress.
She is a bad bitch.
With the sneakiest of tactics.
Pin her to the bed.
That's my Wresltemania match-tress.

It's Young Ragz.
Money bags.
Price tags, nigga.
Still the same nigga.
Just got a little iller.
Got a little sicker.
Tryna get a little richer.
Rest in peace Big L.
Are you getting the big picture?
Yeah...
Rest in peace Big L.
Are you getting the big picture?

They call me Jack CityZ.
Out for platinum plaques and crap.
From my Ill Spoken raps.
Like I was Mac Milly.
And these cats silly, man.
Cause Third Eye gone shine and.
Relish in the moment like an underdog.
When his arm on the podium.
Higher than pickle sodium.
Number one.
And still cop funds with no cocked guns.
Eliminating pellets.
I'm pac-man.
Give niggas the back hand.
I'm that man.
Sneaking in your city all black.
Like I'm batman.
Strapped with the mic in hand.
Packed fast.
Corner of 89th and Summer Ave.
Performing Sebastian with Al and Ragz Bastard.
My niggas fromlunch lines and math classes, to.
Studio booths, sessions with different grasses.
The younger demographic.
Backpacking with hall passes.
They wanna be us.
Dig us from our feet up.
We ill.
No Robutussin pill can free us.
The sickness that we got fam.
Has got into the wrong hands.
I'm so cold, Anaheim flow.
A Mighty Ducks fan.
Something I wanna mention.
Having suspicion how real these bitches livin'.
Let me explain.
Like this one was ji lame.
Past year and some change.
She let niggas get in her brain on Instagram.
Not mentioning names.
Your new found fame is fuckin insane.
The sickness mane.
I bounce back with the quickness.
Ignorance is bliss.
Wait.. fuck that.
Vigilante to eminence, ignorance is hindering.
All about your Benjamins, unmindful to the assault.
Get smacked down to the asphalt.
Like that's his ass fault.
Rapping till my last call.
Bumpin ab soul.
I'm 18, but I got the problems of an old head.
A Comp Sci major bitch, shit gets decoded.
I go in.
Harder than a java fucking program.
In college not cuz I enjoy it, got no other choice.
When me and my boys spark noise.
We outta this joint.

No pity on many, I'm Jack CityZ.
Doing what I please.
Bleed this shit.
Deeds are spent.
Give you what you need.
Beats equipped, in my arsenal.
Battlin'.
And these other rappers are my catalyst.
