Call It A Night Lyrics
by The Swellers.

You handed me a brick.
Special delivery.
Told me to live my dreams.
And the older I get.
I grow tired of throwing it.
I just wanna build something.
I guess I wasn't thinking clearly then.
When I showed you this.
This foreign currency.
I could dig a hole to get to what you know.
I just wanna feel something.
I guess that maybe you've been unimpressed.
With all of this.
This is foreign urgency.
So it's off the shelf into my hands again.
Regress and rewind.
To find the peace of mind.
When it all comes to light.
We can call it a night.
But some of this will stay.
When the feeling fades away.
When it all comes to light.
We can call it a night.
I got to thinking just how much it'd do.
If I traded this foreign currency.
Cause I think we both could use something we both could use.
I'll find my way back home when I'm out of places to go.
I'm done shoveling snow.
But some of this will stay.
When the feeling fades away.
When it all comes to light.
We can call it a night.
Regress and rewind.
To find the peace of mind.
When it all comes to light.
We can call it a night.
But some of this will stay.
When the feeling fades away.
When it all comes to light.
We can call it a night.
We can call it a night.
We can call it a night.
