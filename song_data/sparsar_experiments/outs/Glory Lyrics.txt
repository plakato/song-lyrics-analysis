Glory Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


Long ago when the world was brought to life.
The sun and moon resided in their place.
High above in the stars we watched them fly.
As time became the keeper of our days.
Listen close to the nature of their cry.
The crimson of the sunset in their wake.
Looking close for the shadows up on high.
As night consumed our chances of escape.

Rising up with the wolves to see them die.
The sun and moon were subject to their chase.
Seeing now how they streak across the sky.
Their power may deliver us to waste.

Sink your teeth into the moon tonight.
You can never let the sun slip by.

Far away when the world will end its life.
The sun and moon shall lose and turn to prey.
High above in the stars we'll watch them fly.
As time begins to enter its decay.
