Intake Lyrics
by Volumes.

Hold my hands. Yes, hold them close so tightly for so long I have felt this.
fear.
Take deep breaths, don't give up here just yet.
You swear your endings somewhere near. I was there.
Pulling into my driveway, running straight to the front door.
As to see her tell my family that he had stopped intake long before.
After that coming from every angle, a thousand things running through my head.
Didn't expect it now, no, not now, why it's so soon?
Yet I'm still poised and offering as I tread the living room.
Oh, you held me higher than I thought that I could climb, I'd just say no.
Guilty me. I treated you like shit, and you were all I ever wanted in me.
I owe you it too, because I missed my last chance to say that I love you.
I caught a glimpse of his legs, collapsed in black leaning over the slaves.
A place that I used call home, call my home.
In that street that house where I came from.
Guilty me. I treated you like shit, and you were all I ever wanted in me.
I owe you it too, because I missed my last chance to say that I love you.
Hold my hands. Yes, hold them close so tightly for so long I have felt this.
fear.
Take deep breaths, don't give up here just yet.
You swear your endings somewhere near. I was there.
Pulling into my driveway, running straight to the front door.
As to see her tell my family that he had stopped intake long before.
Guilty me. I treated you like shit, and you were all I ever wanted in me.
I owe you it too, because I missed my last chance to say that I love you.
