One God
by 69 Boyz.


Yeah I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
I will fear no evil.
My dog wit me, is that right.
And I stall they come for me.

Ugh.
Ya'll laying get on the sleep.
But before I do god we need to speak.
Seem like weeks since we last talk.
And although you know my thoughts.
I still need to see it.
So we can chit so we can chat bout this and that.
Can women on top I feel deprived.
Lost on the out and the inside.
Hide I can't no not for you.
Cuz you know everything that I do.
The ups the downs the way I live.
But all my cities just seem to fall here.
No whatever what it is that I do.
You stay true you come through.
A friend when there wasn't a friend to be found.
And when they lay me down in the ground.
I pray that you accept my soul.
Regardless of all the dope that I sold.
Regardless of all the stuff that I stole.
Regardless of all the lies that I told.
And all the stuff that I used to do.
Before I really got to know you.
Though sometime I talk the talk.
And though sometimeI walk the walk.
Lord please understand.
That I am only a man.
Doing everything I can to be strong.
Just try my best to hold on.
Have my gold on in the club tonight.
And on my way home I almost got jacked.
I buck he shot but ain't no way.
He shoulda missed me two feet away.
Unless of course you pardon me.
And all I can do is thank you son.
But it's so much more I can thank you for.
Like when I was at the peak of my fame.
But they had me down to my name.
You still gave me a place to rest.
Now one of my cars got reposessed.
Oh yes your blessings ever did.
So the least I could do is represent.
Tell these kids theres a better way.
Then robbing stealing killing and dope dealing.
Been there done that yes I have.
God blessed those who still on the air.
Forgived em for all the things that they did.
In pursuit of beating they kids.
Guard the guns it ain't our fault.
This ghetto always been talk.
But it's our fault if we don't learn.
Cuz if we don't learn then we gonna burn.
And I put up with the mugging now.
But I can't deal with no car.
So hell ain't the place for me.
Or anywhere else without some macy.
And I may be so outta line.
To pray my prayer to you in rewind.
Disrespect I do not mean.
I just put it in a rap cuz I do not see.
Some gonna call me a hypocrite.
Cuz I deal a record like this.
But this song here ain't for the flow.
I ain't even do it for the radio.
I did this to diss our feel.
And what I feel is so real.
Put that on everything that I love.
One god, one judge.

One god, one judge.
One god, one judge.
One god, one judge.
One god, one judge.

God I don't mean to tie up your phones.
I know the line to talk to you is long.
Millions of calls on your switchboard.
And theres only one of you lord.
So Ima bring this to an end.
Please stay for family and friends.
Prayers that young unguided child.
That just got sent to the juvenile.
Bless my dogs on the avenue.
Thats sought that doing what they got to do.
Held in the sea money nor gold.
And work from losing they soul.
My dogs on paroll bless them too.
One time for the boys in the county blue.
Bless all the mothers come to you crying.
Wondering why they babies keep dying.
Help us keep trying help us to teach.
And tell these freaks that they need to preach.
Unfaithful not to be fake to teach.
Playa hatas it's wrong to hate.
God is late so Im bout to go.
We'll talk again tommorrow.
I asked the darlin in the name of your son.
Amen, I'm done.
