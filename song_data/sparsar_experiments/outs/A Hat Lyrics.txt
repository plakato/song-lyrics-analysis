A Hat Lyrics
by Russian Red.

Aha, aha.
The point is still the silence of your words.
I listen to you more, I listen to you hiding far from the crowd.
In the middle of the cold.
Aha, aha.
The point is still the silence for your voice.
I listen to you more, I listen to you crawling right from the door.
You don't even make a noise.
Take for the falling rain a hat.
Find another story to be told to your ears at night.
Oh, my my....
I pray every night, I was never this scared before.
I wonder where the dark keeps you awake for someone new.
Time is a friend of mine, but we always get into a fight.
Whenever your name is brought up, even for good.
Take for the falling rain a hat.
Find another story to be told to your ears at night.
Oh, my my....
