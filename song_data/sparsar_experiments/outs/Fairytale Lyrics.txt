Fairytale Lyrics
by 3 Shades of Blue.


She was a girl in a lost world.
Lookin' for love.
And I was a boy.
Searchin' for her.
And whoever that we could not make it together.
Were so wrong.
And is missing the lips to a love so.
Love is all we have in this dysfunctional world.

This was a story.
Without a paper.
She was a girl that I wanted to save.
I climbed all the towers.
Slayed all the dragons.
And then with a kiss we ran away.
We ran away.
We ran away.

I was lost in modern day society.
Searchin' for an angel to come and rescue me.
I don't wanna live in darkness come into the light.
Why are we so easily disturbed?
All I wanna do is find her.
I'm not gonna let that beauty out of my sight.

This was a story.
Without a paper.
She was a girl that I wanted to save.
I climbed all the towers.
Slayed all the dragons.
And then with a kiss we both ran away.
We ran away.
We ran away.

This fairytale world.
Is living in my head.
I'll never let it go.

This was a story.
Without a paper.
She was a girl that I wanted to save.
I climbed all the towers.
Slayed all the dragons.
And then with a kiss we both ran away.
We ran away.
