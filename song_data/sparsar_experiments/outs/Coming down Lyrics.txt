Coming down Lyrics
by United States of America.

I think it's over now, I think it's ending.
I think it's over now, I think it's ending.
There is sometimes a later secondary phase.
It's not unusual for it to last for days.
And everything is magnified when it is gone.
Reality is only temporary.
Reality is only temporary.
A process imitating things that went before.
Without a satisfying answer anymore.

I think it's over now, I think it's ending.
I think it's over now, I think it's ending.
There is no time for second answer to the past.
If yesterday is gone don't try to make it last.
And summer winds have come and gone without a flood.
I think it's over now, I think it's ending.
I think it's over now, I think it's ending.
A thought of coloured clouds all high above my head.
A trip that doesn't need a ticket or a bed.
And everything is smelling sweeter then a rose.
