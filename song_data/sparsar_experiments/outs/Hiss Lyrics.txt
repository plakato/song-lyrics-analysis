Hiss Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

The low forces they shut it it and judge it.
The load they speak it out, the low they matter.
Gotta hold it, ooh the strangers come here.
Sit down on your knees.
We'll looking on, no matter these are mean.
He will touch real staks.
That will say, let you extreme.
And the danger to his wife.
That we may see it.
Roll on road and in line will be nothing.
And they put you both to rich.
How justfy the crime that you get.
Wanna plug and they cut the ..of devil.
And the grass drive his style....
And then these are hit.
With all your high, you risk all the sign.
To the high style, you'll be hit with that.
They hold me down, they know for sure that.
Another real and stop us for trick.
They'll be shop, I blow up for it.
Now all is good, blues are quikly.
Now, we are real, and we blowing wild.
Of a crown, the rollies deep down.
And that sheavy be in the moment.
And the way you look to they.
And the way you look to they.
Got us under stress.
That's the way you look to they.
You guessing what they say.
Where would they be at.
They rise all in this.
