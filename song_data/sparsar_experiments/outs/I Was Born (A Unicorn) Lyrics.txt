I Was Born (A Unicorn) Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

DIAMONDS:.
I was born a unicorn.
I missed the ark but I could've sworn you'd wait for me.

GINGER:.
I was born a unicorn.
I could've sworn you believed in me.
Then how come all the other unicorns are dead?

DIAMONDS:.
Put your crystal's under my pillow.
GINGER:.
Send your epistle to my bedfellows.

DIAMONDS:.
If I stop believing in you.
GINGER:.
If you stop believing in me.
DIAMONDS:.
If I stop believing in you.
GINGER:.
If you stop believing in me.

We're the Unicorns.
We're more than horses.
We're the unicorns.
And we're people too!
