Scotty Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.

Now you move so smooth
It's all new inside you
Spins that rhythm
You let push through

Rows to rows mile to mile
Gaze is fixed eyes on fire
Something secret sleeps deep
Inside

It's, your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way. Yeah
And you laugh in their faces
You, say: Scotty's got to stay yeah

They blink once they blink twice
Seen it all hearts like ice
Something secret, sleeps, deep
Within you

It's, your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way. Yeah
And, you laugh in their faces
You, say: Scotty's got to stay, yeah

It's your natural place
And. You laugh in their faces

It's. Your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way. Yeah
You laugh in their faces
You, say: ... 

It's your natural place

You stay

Scotty's got his way. Yeah

You laugh in their faces

You, say: ... 

Scotty's got to stay yeah.
