Simpler Things Lyrics
by Xavier Simmons.


Please hang up and try again.

All of my life, I was lied to.
Life is full of discoveries.
But some things, I wish I never knew.
I wanna be a child.
And know nothing at all.
And not decide what's right or wrong.
Just roam the world until the lights come on.
Come on.

Comptemplate my life as I drift along the shore.
Draw my friends, erase the world.
The life I live will be a storyboard.
Paper planes and plastic trains.
Balloons in the sky, when did it all change?
When did it all change?

There's pain behind my eyes.
My eyes are open wide.
I know the truth, I can't pretend.
I can never be a kid again.
There's pain behind my eyes.
The lies are open wide.
I know the truth, I can't pretend.
I can never be a kid again.

Disappear into the past.
Before it all collapsed.
