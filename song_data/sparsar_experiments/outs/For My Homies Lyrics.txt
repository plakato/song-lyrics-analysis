Freestyle Right Here For My Homies Son 
They, Want To Believe In Me From The Junk Son 
Not Like All These Trouts Suckin On My Dick

Straight Shittin' Up Game Shit, Son

LISTEN UP 
 
Imma Ride For My Homies 
Imma Die For My Homies 
Imma Ride For My Homies

Puttin' On For My Homies 
Movin' From The Beginnin' 
You Know I Be Winnin'. 
Yeah Son 
We Came Up. 
Those Trouts Would Talk Shit, 
They Weren't About That Shit. 
They Knew I Have A Plan 
Cuz, I'm A Rich White Man 
I'm On Worldstar

Puttin' On All My Homies Know What Is Good 
I'm, The Only White Nigga In The Whole Neighbourhood, 
Sony, Vaio, California, You Know, What's Good

But. It Give A Hoot Fuckin', Dissappeared 
And, I'm Yet To Return 
And. You Know I Ride..
