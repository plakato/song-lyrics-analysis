Guns & Caprisuns Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


Swear, my mama call me Nino for a reason cause. She know what type of nigga she
raised 
Way before a nigga flow was appraised. She know the avenue that he on 
Where, you got ta, be down for the shits nigga or get punished for your treason. 
Made me promise not to eat the beef up. Nigga had me feeling like a vegan, 
Summer time'round, the way boy, it's only guns and caprisuns 
And, I'm praying that it never end cause. I swear to God. I hated school 
I rather drop out and gangbang cause. My big homie made it cool 
With, his trunk full of 808s and his denim full of 1. Oh ohs 
Backyard. We would spit our flows, money, power and pussy that be the anthem, 
Started trappin'. Now these bitches think I'm hansome 
Mama say I need The Holy Ghost. I think a phantom ghost the answer - 
 
One time for them dreamers out there staying on their pivot, 
On the road to riches, I'mma get a speeding ticket 
For. All my dogs in Heaven and my homies. That'S in prison 
Who put their faith in me. I promise I'll complete the mission 
Man it's guns and caprisuns all scattered on my floor 
Man. It'S hipster, chicks and weaponry all scattered on my floor 
Said, it's juice, pouches and magazines, all scattered on my floor 
Boy, it's guns and caprisuns. It'S guns and caprisuns 
 
My mindset, could've, kidnapped me and been holding me for ransom, 
Lost boy. Since the playground had no one tending to my chances. 
Now a nigga might take drugs and other times take chances 
Just a dope boy, wit dreams. I would skateboard and bump CREAM 
Cash rules. Everything around me. Dollar dollar bill, ya'll, 
One time put your hands up high cause a nigga wan na feel ya'll 
 
One day we gonn all be famous 
One day. We gonn all be famous 
One day. We gonn all be famous 
One day. We gonn all be famous 
 
Told, my mama one day. I would have a million dollars, 
Then put it on a credit card and let her do the honors
