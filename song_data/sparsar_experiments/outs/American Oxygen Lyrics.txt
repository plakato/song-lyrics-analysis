American Oxygen Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


Breathe out, breathe in.
American oxygen, whoa.
Every breath I breathe.
Chasin' this American Dream.
We sweat for a nickel and a dime.
Turn it into an empire, whoa.
Breathe in this feeling.
American, American oxygen.

Refrain.
American oxygen.
Breathe in this feeling.
American, American oxygen.

Outside looking in.
Starin' at the great wide open.
Young girl, hustlin' on the other side of the ocean.
She can be anything at all in America, America.
I say, can't see.
Just close your eyes and breathe.

Breathe out, breathe in.
American oxygen, whoa.
Every breath I breathe.
Chasin' this American Dream.
We sweat for a nickel and a dime.
Turn it into an empire, whoa.
Breathe in this feeling.
American, American oxygen.

Refrain.
American oxygen.
Breathe in, this feeling.
American, American oxygen.
American oxygen.
Breathe in, this feeling.
American, American oxygen.

Bright lights glistenin'.
Looking at the world from a distance.
A young boy grindin', tryna get the wheels in motion.
But he can be anything at all, America, America.
I say, can't see.
Just close your eyes and breathe.

Breathe out, breathe in.
American oxygen, whoa.
Every breath I breathe.
Chasin' this American Dream.
We sweat for a nickel and a dime.
Turn it into an empire, whoa.
Breathe in this feeling.
American, American oxygen.

This is the new America.
We are the new America.
This is the new America.
We are the new America.

Breathe out, breathe in.
American oxygen, whoa.
Every breath I breathe.
Chasin' this American Dream.
We sweat for a nickel and a dime.
Turn it into an empire, whoa.
Breathe in this feeling.
American, American oxygen.

Refrain.
American oxygen, whoa.
Breathe in, this feeling.
American, American oxygen.
American oxygen, whoa.
Breathe in, this feeling.
American, American oxygen.

This is the new America.
We are the new America.
This is the new America.
We are the new America.
