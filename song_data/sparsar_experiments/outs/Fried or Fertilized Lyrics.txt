Fried or Fertilized Lyrics
by Yung Humma.


How you like your eggs, fried or fertilized?
The way you move your hips, girl, make me hypnotized.
How you like your eggs, fried or fertilized?
Fried or fertilized?
Fried or, fried or fertilized?
Fried or, fried or fertilized?
Fried or, fried or fertilized?
Fried or, fried or fertilized?
The way you move your hips, girl, make me hypnotized.

Yung Humma.
Early in the morning, 'bout nine o'clock.
Had a freak last night. Made her body rock.
Feeling kind of groggy. Stomach toss and turning.
She said, Was that your belly or was it birds chirping?
I said that I was hungry. She said, Baby, me too.
Why don't we go out and get us some breakfast, boo?
We ain't gotta leave to get no breakfast food.
'cuz I'm a lady tamer and a chef too.
So I began to cook.

She wasn't ready for the recipe in Humma's book!

She said, I love the eggs. What did you do to 'em?
The way they smell and taste really got a girl drooling..
I knew that you would like it. Why you so surprised?
How you like your eggs, fried or fertilized?
Fried or fertilized? Baby, I'm confused!
Don't be offended. You got it misconstrued.
When I say fried, I'm talking breakfast eggs.
But when I fertilize, those the eggs between your legs.
She began to blush. I heard her coochie whistle..
She was fiending for the heat up out of Humma's missle.

I ain't playing girl. Don't think you realize.
How you like your eggs, fried or fertilized?
I ain't playing girl. Don't think you realize.
How you like your eggs, fried or fertilized?
I ain't playing girl. Don't think you realize.
How you like your eggs, fried or fertilized?
I ain't playing girl. Don't think you realize.
How you like your eggs, fried or fertilized?
