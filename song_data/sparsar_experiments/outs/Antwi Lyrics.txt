Antwi Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


I'm going through a break-up again.
I see a dozen women and I break up with ten.
I put 'em back together then I break 'em again.
That's a match made in heaven or the thin line between.
Love and hate that we cross 'till it makes us repent.
I'm tryna let you know that this plays on my head.
So you don't have to wait till I'm dead.
Cause patience ain't one of your strengths.
I waited a lifetime just to end up in the limelight.
I write rhymes so they won't consider me an Einstein.
While they was nominated for a Grammy for the ninth time.
I was shedding tears with my family in the nite nite.
Night time's over, I see man acting like Scarface.
But they won't survive like Sosa.
The night I woke up was when that black car rolled up.
I was like nine years old, blud.
Shopping for my mother, went to buy a tin of corned beef.
Car lights flashing, is this when me and the Lord meet?

I guess it wasn't for me.
I've skipped death more than you've skipped breath.
In your gym sesh, cardio won't make the kid wretch.
I've seen the prince cry when the king left.
Is the Queen gonna check mates or keep him in check?
Now I've seen a gunner ball rolling like him with check.
Screaming suck your mudda, incest.
It makes you wonder where the kid went.
When gunshot lick all our in friend.
But fear won't allow you to be yourself.
I'm Cool J in a Kangol, yeah, I did it well.
Don't wanna see us bond, guess they'd rather I Stringer Bell.
So that's why I punch above my weight till I beat Adele.
I am Shakespeare with great hair.
I'll probably be the next Wayne Hector in eight years.
Tinchy had to break a few records to break here.
Drake really had to take the pressure to Take Care.
Take care of you, take care of me, take care of us.
Take care of Mum, take care of everyone.
You see how fast the hate turns to love.
When everybody has to rate what you've done.
Man will throw shade on the slums.
But I rate what it made me become.
See, I could have been wasted and dumped.
Stuck with about an eighth in my lungs.
Yeah, I pray the fuckboys keep their distance.
I'm listening to Berys, putting up a resistance.
You can keep your merits, man, I come for distinctions.
I'm from the type of home where my brother's my sister.
But that don't make a difference cuh I love her to bits and.
We're just some have-nots tryna master the system.
I had a mega drive when I was running the infants.
Young Fire, Old Flame, you'll get bun in the distance.
Wait for me.
Mummy, won't you pray for me?
Heavy like I'm carrying a slave on me.
But I'm just carrying the game on me.
It's just a game.
They say it's just a game, they say it's just a game.
Well, if this is just a game.
Why we dying just to play?
It's just a game.
They said it's just a game, they say it's just a game.
Well, if this is just a game.
Why we dying just to play?
And for you, this might be another eight.
But for me, this is just another day.
Just another race, in a race with the racists.
Tryna make it off the slave ship.
Can I get a break? Cause I don't want another chase.
Cause I'm tired and there's no one to relate.
Nor can nobody relate.
My grandmother was a great.
I had to put her in a grave, now my shoulder still aches.
I had to carry her away.
I'm still carrying the pain.
Fuck marrying the fame.
This is for my family to gain.
And the young niece carrying my name.

Pray for me, yeah.
Pray for me, yeah.
Pray for me, yeah.
