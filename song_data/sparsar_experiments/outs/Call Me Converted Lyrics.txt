Call Me Converted Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

The beats of your heart are starting to show.
The world waits outside your hospital window.
And I'd trade anything for your heartbeat to be.
Sequenced in your bloodstream.

So you can resist the urge to hit the dirt with me again.
Bar none you gotta be one of our best friends.
And this is far and away one of the hardest things that I've ever done.

But we will hold this line cause true courage never dies.
It hurt like hell when they broke the news.
But your iron will can take you through.
And here's the thunder I will bring you in return.

The beats of your heart are starting to show.
The world waits outside your hospital window.
And I'd trade anything for your heartbeat to be.
Sequenced in your bloodstream.

I feel the sinker in the pit of my stomach at the thought.
I get tears in my eyes, just writing this, and I don't give a fuck who knows.
it.
I wanna tell you that I'll have them sing for you as loud as they can.
It's the least the crowd and I can do.
We are the unanimous sky you will spend the rest of your long life under.
Our reign won't ever be denied, I wish you could help me sing this.

We will hold this line cause true courage never dies.
It hurt like hell when they broke the news.
But your iron will can take you through.
And heres the thunder I will bring you in return.

The beats of your heart are starting to show.
The world waits outside your hospital window.
And I'd trade anything for your heartbeat to be.
Sequenced in your bloodstream so you can resist~.
I wish you could help me sing this.

Your voice was always louder than mine.
I wish you could help me sing these lines.
Cause bar-none you gotta be one of our best friends.
