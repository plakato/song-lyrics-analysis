Wasteland Lyrics
by Tyler Cassidy.

Wastelands, kids that only color with the gray crayon.
We break bread, we break bones, we never catch a break man.
This hate man, it's crazy. Stays with me on the daily.
You've a better chance of catching Halley's Comet than to save me.

Hold me under water I can live like this for days.
It doesn't faze me anymore it's just another fuckin page.
Another mother fuckin' way that they can set me off again.
They can make the river run but they can't make the river end.

Cuz there's no dam, other than my damnation.
See this damn nation, I got no damn faith in.
It's either food stamps, or boot camp, or deal this.
Get locked up, get knocked up, restart the cycle, it's psycho.

We stand inside our rooms and we stare out of our windows.
Planes crash down trees fall as the wind blows.
The crashing of the cymbals. We shudder and we tremble.
And we wonder what it's like, cuz our lives are never simple.

We wonder what it's like, when the grass replaces pavement.
When everything is great where there's no hate and there's no satan.
What's our fate? Don't keep me waitin', I'm carryin' this weight.
And now my state of mind is waste whoever wants to leave me wasted.
