Sincerely Yours Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Dear I write you this letter.
To show you how much your love means to me.
I wish we could be together.
I need you in my life oh can't you see.
You promised we would be together.
But you still haven't answered my letter.

Oh, oh, I'm sincerely yours.
The one my heart beats for, the one I adore.
Oh, oh, I'm sincerely yours.
The love that you gave I've never felt before.

Dear as I write you this letter.
The pain in my heart boy has run so deep.
I fear we won't be together.
Without you my life feels so incomplete.
You said our love will last forever.
But you still haven't answered my letters.

Oh, oh, I'm sincerely yours.
The love that you gave I've never felt before.
Oh, oh, I'm sincerely yours.
The one my heart beats for, the one I adore.

My precious love I just can't believe.
The letters I send you don't receive.
You don't know how hard I try.
Throw my pride aside and I can't deny.
Cause every night I write without fail.
And your --- missed my mail.
But if ever this letter should reach your door.
You'll find it signed sincerely yours.

Now I know we'll be together, together baby.
Cause you just answered my letter.
