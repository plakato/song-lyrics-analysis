Everything's A Miracle Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

You put the clouds aside.
Illuminate the sky.
Through every dark and hazy night you are my guide.
For every town we find.
We'll paint a new skyline.
We will always wake up in a different place and time.
As we begin descending faster than illumination.
You hold me steady.
Yeah, you show no fear or.
Limitation.
You turn the ocean tide.
You shake me up inside.
The way I feel with you words can't describe.
I don't know why or how.
But I can't disavow I've.
Never felt the way I feel right.
Now.
So, don't burn out.
Just don't burn out.
I've got the brightest star you'll ever find.
Even the sun is jealous of the way you shine.
We are the constellations in the sky.
Wrap me up in your arms.
It's beautiful when time is ours and everything's a miracle.
