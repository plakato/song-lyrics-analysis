Doubt Lyrics
by SycAmour.

It's the things we might have done.
That fester inside us.
Blow out the fires inside us.
I know it's dire, but.
You'll never know.
The weight of a human soul.
I'm cold, tantalized by all of the.
Blood, blood, blood.
Not til you see the.
Blood, blood, blood.

So say what you wanna say, my baby. You'll see.
Bleed how you wanna bleed, while you can. Darling.
When they come. Snatch you up away.
When The misery causes you to fade.
Chariot. Lift me up away.

What if I wanted to run?
Could anyone hide us?
Somewhere where that no one could find us?
My eyes are tired but.

I started taking my chances when I lost one.
Awakened by cold, abrasive sun.
Living, un-living amongst the lost.
But I've seen the blood. Now I've seen the blood.

Deep underground, a mother sings lullabies, To her child.
I need know, I need to know how much it means.
If I live or leave.

We'll bring, disease and murder.
But you'll see, we can see further than you do.
The truth's more important:.
Than mental abortion, for profit and fucking fortune.
You pried us, away from our sanity.
Chide us, for taking humanity.
Back, back, back.
Now we're taking it back, back, back.
