Differences Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


I could see the, i could see the difference, i could see it.
? job pay attention , i could see it.
I could see the way we treat our own shit, i could see it.
Like we don't even care bout our own shit.

Why we ain't got sidewalks in the hood?

Why niggas gotta always be niggas?

Why black folks ? and if you do best believe it's gon be niggas.

I ain't talkn bout black folks, talking bout that folks, just these niggas.

I love my black folks, i love being black but i fucking hate these niggas.

Mane, niggas get mad bout Trayvon, shoot a kid same age and the same race.

Niggas wanna change this shit, but then still do the same thing, don't be mad.
at me.

I love turning up like the next man, don't get me wrong.

Some of y'all nigga been turning up for way to long.

And i can see it.

I could see the difference, i could see the difference.
I could see it, ? job pay attention.
I could see the way we treat out own shit.
Obviously we don't even care for our own shit.

Why i gotta watch my back when i get around black folks that look just like me.

How can i show these white folks that we aren't all like em.

When your ass always on tv.

You always on the news nigga.

Shot a nigga for some shoes nigga.

Got in a fight from a conversation.

Got me clicking white on my application.

Now i gotta act super educated, thanks to the stereotypes that you now created.

Look at how hard you niggas have made it.

I pray to god that a nigga make it.

I'm tryna start a new black movement that don't act nothing like you at.

Wish i could start a whole new black community where can't none of y'all.
niggas move at.

Cause i could see it, i could see the difference.
I could see it, ? job pay attention.
I could see the way we treat our own shit.
Obviously we don't even care for our own shit.
