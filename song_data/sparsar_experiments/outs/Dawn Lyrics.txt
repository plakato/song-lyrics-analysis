Dawn Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


After all is said and done.
The night has won.
Watch the stars disappear.
They burn out quietly.
And in the sky, we will know.
The Sun will rise.
No, I won't look away.
I won't deny my soul.

Yeah, it arrives.
Hanging low, in the sky.
Dawn, wake me up.
But let me dream, before I die.

In the light of the sun.
The day has come.
Watch our lives drift away.
They burn out quietly.
But in our minds, we will know.
That it was real.
No, I won't let it go.
I won't deny my hope.
