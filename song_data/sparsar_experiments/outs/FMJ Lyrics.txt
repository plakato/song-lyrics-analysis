FMJ Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.


It's showtime, nigga cut the lights on.
Big one's, bigger than a python.
F.M.J. Wooh Da King don't play.
Real talk, Wooh Da Kid 'bout gun play.
I ain't playing with 'em, no letting up.
B.S.M., we setting up.
Hundred-thousand in my pocket right now.
I don't mean sick when I say my check up.
F.M.J., full metal jacket, Wooh Da Kid don't play.
That's on O.J., everything over here aye O.K.
Get money over here, yeah we keep it brackin'.
I'm locked and loaded, full metal jacket.

This is kick door, put your hands up.
? make a nigga stand up.
Dropping shells, sit him right back down.
Life on mute, won't make no sound.
Wooh Da, King a beast.
Fucking up this chain, I don't need no leash.
My boys say they hungry then my boys gon' eat.
I can do it acapella, I don't need no beat.
Put Southside on it, cross the line, get the whole southside on.
B.S. on the B.S. get your T wet if a nigga think about my squad homie.
F.M.J., D.J. Ace, Trapaholics don't play.
I'm on my way, headed to the top with a fully loaded K.
