Dynamite Lyrics
by Viza.

Here little Billy lemme.
Tell you about a man.
In command.
He rushed his people to the.
Beat of his five year plan.

Build it, wield it, watch it.
Fill the night, now Stalin.
Says to sit and watch.
It light...Dynamite!

Here little Billy now make.
Sure you wash your hands.
They're hot on our tail.
In old Mercedes-Benz.

Build it, wield it, watch it.

Fill the night, now Stalin.
Says to sit back and watch.
It light...Dynamite!

Dynamite!
Dynamite!
Dynamite!

Comrades! Tonight we are.
Gathered before to witness.
The greatest achievement.
Man has come to see.
Tonight we make history.
Tonight we make..Dynamite!
