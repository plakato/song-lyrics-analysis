Boys
by The Wrens.

Boys you won't remember.
From the minute.
You walked into the room.
Every letter started brokenhearted.
And ended way too soon.

Lived through underrated.
Getting jaded.
To wind up with no one.
Hiding in new places getting wasted.
Singing i guess we're done.

I don't want you to wonder why.
I don't want you to wonder why.
Won't do any good.
You don't know what you got into.
Until you know when it's all gone, gone....

I don't feel the need to try and explain.
Excuses sounding insane.
You're gonna find, you're gonna find.
I've been knocked down.
But i've stood up.
Down off of the ground.
But i've stood up.
Lost without a sound.
But i've stood up.
To faced another round.
But i've stood up.
You want me, you want me....

I don't know what you got on me.
Even in just you wait and see.

I dont feel the need to try and explain.
Excuses sounding insane.
You're going to find.
You're going to find.
I'm feeling down.
But i've stood up.
Down off of the ground.
But i've stood up.
Lost without a sound.
But i've stood up.
To face another round.
But i've stood up.
You want me, you want me.
