Weatherman Lyrics
by +44.

So you think you've been through it all.
But I can't help but wonder now.
Yesterday I found my worst regret.
I'll hide it away so no one ever knows.

I'm dying.
I'm trying to leave.

Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on.
Every now and then I feel the end of us.

I never meant to say I'm sorry.
And I'm not sad to see you go.
We're human shapes burned on concrete walls.
These days the sun don't shine here anymore.

I'm dying....
I'm trying to leave.

Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on.
Every now and then I feel the end of us.
I love the way you breathe inside my head.
But something's gotta change, I'm barely holding on.

Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on.
Every now and then I feel the end of us.
I love the way you breathe inside my head.
But something's gotta change, I'm barely holding on.
Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on.
Every now and then I feel the end of us.
I love the way you breathe inside my head.
But something's gotta change, I'm barely holding on.

I'm barely holding on.
I'm barely holding on.
