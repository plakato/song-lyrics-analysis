World Class Lyrics
by World Class Wreckin Cru.

Artist: The World Class Wreckin Cru.
Album: World Class.
Song: World Class.

We call him Yella, he is the best.
He rocks the house on the DMX.
When he's on the beatbox, he cannot miss.
So listen to the beat, as he rocks like this....

Yes, Yella is his name, and he's created.
The big beat sound, so devastated.
Party people in the place, you beware of the shock.
Cos Yella  Yella is on the beatbox, huh!

To feel the beat, it's time for you.
To rock with the devastatin' Wreckin Cru.
You got snare, hi-hat and bass in your face.
So come on Yella boy, let's wreck this place, huh!

The headlines read We are in Town.
The World Class Cru is gonna throw down.
We are here, and here to stay.
And we came to raise hell, and not to play.
As we grow stronger, you get weaker.
Sucker MC put your ear to the speaker.
There is no doubt that we are best.
We don't have to scratch just to make the beat fresh.
The beat will blast and we'll outlast.
There is no other that's in its class.
It's not a 808 or a Drum-u-lator.
It's a DMX and it is greater.
It makes a sound that's so unique.
Huh! To rock your butt and move your feet.
Now sucker MC's we will impress.
Cos Yella  Yella on the DMX, huh-huh!

Breakdown!

Party people in the place, we're not through.
We're gonna show just what we're gonna do.
So listen up close and don't miss a word.
Cos it is the hardest rap you ever heard.
Like a blast from heaven, a blaze from hell.
Who's comin' on the mic? Well, it's Cli-n-tel.
So sucker MC's, you better beware.
Cos I will be your next nightmare.
Yes, I am fresh, the MC wizard.
When it comes to cold raps, huh, I'm a blizzard.
Well, I'm the genius, the mastermind.
Super def creator of MC rhymes.
So come a little closer and you will see.
Who? The Cli-n-tel's in the place to be.
Now comin' on the mic without delay.
A little Bom bom bom... It's Dr Dre.
I'm the physician who's gonna start dishin'.
All them things that you've been missin'.
If it's for answers that you have been fishin'.
Take a bite of this for your nutrition.
I'm the real doctor, that is final.
All you other suckers are made of vinyl.
I won the election to issue injections.
To who? Sucker MC's who wish for perfection.
Next in line there's Lonzo.
Producer of the groove, grandmaster of the show.
The head debater, there is none greater.
Because he is the Cru's creator.
You put us all together, you've got the best.
While Yella throws down on a DMX, huh-huh!
