Baby Get Lost Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.

Well good morning baby welcome back to town.
How'd, fine papa, welcome back to town.
You're doing so much travelling never know.

When you'll be around.
You're a fine and mellow fellow.
But you're stubborn as a mule.
You love me like an angel.
But you treat me like a fool.
Two-faced daddy don't hand me no doublecross.
You'll see any time I'm ready.
I can tell you baby get lost.

Doing anything you choose.
You're cheating on the outside.

You better come back on the inside.

Don't want no trouble I've got to be the boss.
Cause you got too much to lose.
And if you can't play it my way.

Well now baby get lost.
I try to stop your cheating.
But I just don't have the time.
Cause I got so many men that.
Keep cool papa, you got to corne across.
They're standing right in line.
Cause any time I'm ready, yes any time I'm ready.
You know when I'm ready.
I can tell you baby get lost.
Why don't you get lost.
