1st Time Again Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


You came into my world and taught me thangs 
And. I can't lie cause boy. You did yo' thangs 
Feel, like I'm floatin. When I hear yo' name 
I, think you made me fall in love again: 
 
Okay, 
Screwed, Up Click, 
Yeah, 
, 
Z-Ro 
Whenever. You need a nigga call me up, I'm on my way, 
Sex or serious conversation I'll, listen to what you have to say. 
This ain't got ta C about a wham bam. Thank you, ma'am 
I'm, not like these other fellas, although I know you think I am 
Even, though I kick it with a lot of females. 
I can honestly tell you that I ain't got ta female 
But since I'm fresh out of jail. You probably thank that I just wan na bone 
Hit it quit. It then delete your # from my mobile phone 
Can't. You see the tattoo reads: one deep 
So. I need only one lil' momma, one cup of codeine and one Swisher sweet 
Weight of the world is on my shoulders because I'm thuggin 
But, sometimes even the hardest of us - need some lovin 
And. The first time with you is like my first time again: 
Like rediscoverin rap music writin. My first rhyme again 
You say you feel like you're floatin. Well, I'm floatin too 
Everybody's leavin. Now you know it's time for you and Z-Ro to do. 
 
Z-Ro 
Now tell the truth:
