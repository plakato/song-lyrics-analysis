Batman Arkham Origins Lyrics
by Yungtown.


Cold heart has been lost with my armor that arrives on a small lift.
As soon as I equip my gloves, belt, Batclaw and mask I'll be off quick.
Alfred put the Christmas dinner off.
There's a larger problem that we have to solve.
All I know is that it involves Black Mask.
Who is classically taken capture of.
A political figure, the little poor mister.
Commissioner Loeb, approaching Death Row.
Along with the villains who want to get rid of him.
And so they throw him, into the smoke.
I mean dang he is so forgetful.
I don't wanna say any mean things.
While Killer Crocs on the rooftop.
And I'm about the break out his neat fangs.
You wanna keep breathing watch.
I am not the type who becomes complacent.
Happy Christmas Eve Croc.
Here's my technique of collecting information.
Regardless of the quantity of enemies.
Dropped in front of me.
I'll tie together some strikes that'll leave em.
Unconscious in a deep cloud.
Traveling to each piece of the map.
To find the truth behind the fiend in the mask.
Even if it is technically the season to completely relax.
For now I might be misunderstood cause I see how the people react.
Thought I deceive and distract.
You will have a reason to believe in the Bat.

I'm a myth and a beast of Gotham.
Welcome to the prequel of Arkham.
Discreetly leap on a gargoyle.
To defeat you without a combo.
And I can solve each puzzle.
Each problem as precise as can be.
You better be cautious.
Because it's dangerous when I'm on the scene.
It's time to prolong what is right.
In the chilly snowfall of the night.
There is no squad that can kill me.
Cause I'm so focused in a fight.
A ghost once a smoke bomb goes off.
Then throw stuff that'll leave you cross-eyed.
And just because I won't let you die.
Doesn't mean I have a soft side.
