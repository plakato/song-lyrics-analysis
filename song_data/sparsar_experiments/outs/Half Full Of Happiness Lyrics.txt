Half Full Of Happiness Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

In touch with myself.
Feel your touch like glass.
Standing in the way of.
Something new.
Private confusion now.
Plubic view.
Problems in the way of.
Solving you.

Half full of happiness.
Record playing Lover's Game.
Just room for loneliness.
As empty days overflow.
Half full of happiness.
Record playing Lover's Game.
In this loneliness.
Empty days overflow.

Simple choices left.
Left to complicate.
Know only half of what I say.
Rumours feed a hungry mind.
And I can't peel away from.
These four walls.

Half full of happiness.
Record playing Lover's Game.
Just room for loneliness.
As empty days overflow.
Half full of happiness.
Record playing Lover's Game.
In this loneliness.
Empty days overflow.

Half full of happiness.
Record playing Lover's Game.
Just room for loneliness.
As empty days overflow.
Half full of happiness.
Record playing Love'r's Game.
In this loneliness.
Empty days overflow.
