The Show Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

Welcome to my laboratory, I'm on my grind man.
An EP in one day? I'm out my mind man.
I out write what you spend a month trying to craft.
Not to mention it took one night, yea I know your mad.
But cheer up, I know you're good at some stuff.
Like buying clothes, sweating hoes, and shoving up your butt plug.
Yea.
The talent's inconceivable.
But I have to dumb it down to make it more believable.
Standing on a balcony, a crowd full of people.
Shouting, screaming out to me, tryna catch an earful.
Swelling up the balance of my next account receivable.
All for writing little rhymes, man I love this gift if mine.
