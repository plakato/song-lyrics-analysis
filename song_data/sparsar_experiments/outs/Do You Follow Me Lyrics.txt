Do You Follow Me Lyrics
by United States of America.

I can't be no one.
I can't see no one.
Do you follow me?
I can't touch no one.
I can't have no fun.
Do you follow me?
Cause Im blind.
In my mind.
And thats all.
That anything means to me.
Just how it seemed to be.
Between the melody.
Drive all em in into the sea.
What is the way for me.
Think that I want to be real.
When you say my name.
It doesnt feel the same.
As your tellin me.
I know I may be lame.
I do not blame.
You for killing me.
Its not you.
Its not me.
Its not them.
Were all the casualties.
Fooled by a make believe.
Individuality.
Inside the heart is free.
How does it feel to be afraid of being afraid.
Friends I have known have left me with no tongue.
Feeling I have nothing to say.
Friends have come near.
For reasons now unclear.
And left with me with a taste for what its like.
For what theyre like.
I can't be no one.
I can't see no one.
Do you follow me.
I can't touch no one.
I can't have no fun.
Do you follow me.
Cause Im blind.
In my mind.
And thats all.
That anything means to me.
Just how it seemed to be.
Between the melody.
Drive all em in into the sea.
What is the way for me.
Think that I want to be real.
