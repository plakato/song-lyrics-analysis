The Fly Lyrics
by World Class Wreckin Cru.

Artist: World Class Wreckin Cru.
Album: First Round Knockout.
Song: The Fly.

Everybody why don't you try.
A brand new dance that we call The Fly.
Just move your hands, shake your neck.
And move your body just like an insect.

The Fly, yeah, is what you got to do.
The Fly, aha, just let it land on you.
The Fly, yeah, let it take control.
The Fly, aha, in the sugar mould.

Now the sound of The Fly is what you heard.
Don't get confused WARK! with the bird.
You're doin The Fly and it's gettin hotter.
Now step to the side, here comes a fly swatter.

Interlude:.

Fly yeah.
Fly y-y-y-y-yeah.
Fly yeah yeah.
Fly aha.
Fly yeah.
Fly aha.
In the sugar mould.

You're doin The Fly and you've got it made.
Don't worry about HAA! that can of Raid.
It's only here to keep the peace.
But if you mess with The Fly it will be released.

Now senoritas don't feel shy.
We also brought along the Spanish Fly.
So keep on dancin, you're doin fine.
Hey DJ, start that record one more time.

Interlude.
