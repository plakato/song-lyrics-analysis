Coffee Eyes Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

Two dollars, twenty-seven cents.
January seventeenth, 2006.
Here in a diner with my friends.
Talking about how the year went.
A few years later I walk in.
Patty knew my drink.
And she asks where the hell we've been?
You used to come here every night.
It's not the same without you kids.
I cut my hand on a piece of glass.
The time we found Dave half dead in the parking lot.
Spent the rest of the night in the ER.
I cut my hand on a piece of glass.
And I hope the scar lasts.
So I don't forget that.

There's been a table for me there.
Through coffee eyes and blank stares.
Our late night affairs.
There's always been a table for me there.
So you can try to forget or say it's the past.
You know you'll always end up right back where you left.

I ended up here late at night on Thanksgiving.
The fall that Colleen left.
This was the place to call home.
When it felt like the world didn't want us.
I watched Mike slash Mon's tires.
We laughed about it later.
I watched friendships dissolve.
In the booth on the back wall.
I cut my hand on a piece of glass.
And I hope the scar lasts.

There's always been a table for me there.
Through coffee eyes and blank stares.
Our late night affairs.
There's always been a table for me there.
So you can try to forget or say it's the past.
You know you'll always end up right back where you left.

There's always been a table for me there.
There's always been a table for me there.
There's always been a table for me there.
Through all of the years.
There's always been a table for me there.
Through all of the years.
There's always been a table for me there.
Through all of the years.
There's always been a table for me there.
