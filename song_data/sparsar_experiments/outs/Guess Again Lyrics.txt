Guess Again Lyrics
by 57 Pixels.


I'm sick, got caught with food poisoning.
It's not what you know. To win.
It's what you are able to show to them.
It's mo' a sin to smoke a spliff then owners when.
Their opening heads over poker chips.
Cause since day one every battle against the corporates been.
A corporate win. And no one sims to care.
Unless it bares, cash or profit in a nice shiny form of gems.
And now cops have decided they don't have to holster it.
What a load of bogus shit.
Of course they're mostly racist pricks.
Hand picked from solely failure list.
All in hope they won't boast over power they know is theirs.
But shit you guessed it.
Peace seems only able to last two seconds.
Before it leaves; flees like when a thief sees a necklace.
More perplexin' than parents finding out their kids pregnant.
Check it, best record.
Whom's tendency's to spend with ease like tha presdent.
No questions, scared enough to let him severe what's left of.
What it means to be American.
Those riots in Ferguson.
By blind angry herds of men.
Trying to hurt the man but only able hurt themselves.
One man dies and that prolly lead.
To the amount dead to be 'round thirty men.
And while they loot and shoot.
As a group of lun-itics.
It proves that through this loop of useless feuds.
We aren't as prudent as a unit should.
Chea, you guessed it. You was right.
But sometimes I feel like more than just one guy.
As radiant as rays of sunshine.
I don't mean to come by, full of myself.
Like I took a chunk out of my front thigh.
Or butt hide but soon the government.
Won't be able to do anything but hide.
Haha and truth be told.
That trying to be a rapper is a stupid goal.
But I conquered being that with stupendous soul.
A youthful boy whom you should tune in to mo'.
