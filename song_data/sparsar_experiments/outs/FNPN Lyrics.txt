FNPN Lyrics
by Zip K..


 Got ta watch your back 
These niggas out here, gon' hate to see you win, 
 Got ta watch your friends 
For the right price tag, never know them. Rules might bend, 
 Got ta, stay alert and trust. No fuck nigga 
Steal the words right out your mouth 
Say word: point em out: 
Nigga swerve, reroute, 
, 
Fuck, nigga, 
Fuck, nigga, 
Fuck, nigga, 
Pussy, nigga, 
Pussy, nigga, 
Fuck, nigga, 
Fuck, nigga, .
 
Let me tell you something: bout! Young Zipper 
I done shot more paper than a printer 
When. I was a baby gave my babysitter jitters 
I made that sitter reconsider 
That come up, make fucks, feel bitter 
Can't trust niggas, Can't trust, hoes 
And. They say I'm a lost case 
When in that case. This case done closed 
I, remember most everything 
I'm taking shots for my leisure 
Except when coppers ask questions 
Uhh. So this a case of amnesia 
That, whip game, a eggbeater 
Thats, more scales than a room full of libras 
Watch out for lions and moochers and cheaters 
That's. Three strikes like the shoes is Adidas. 
 Got ta dodge fuck niggas. I ain't got no choice: 
Screaming fuck, these hoes till I got no voice 
And. I pray that God protect me from all my foes 
Then. I started losing friends, but you know how it goes. 
 
Bitch I'm slicker than Ricky, and you faker than a McChicken 
My main chick is New Vicki and my side chick. Don'T do hickeys 
No way, Jose fill the cup Rozay 
That grind, don't play 
Every crime cold case 
100 dollar bill old, face 
Junk in the trunk. How she got no waist 
Shit just got real 
Shit just got Ferocious 
Roaches in my ashtray fat as real roaches 
Ho. You know. I got ta ball 
Most of my bitches over thirty 
You. Just talk about that barley, 
Kenny, Buckley, Ernie, Ohh 
Who knew I had screws lose and I walk around with that. Deuce deuce 
The irony, while I zoom zoom 
Is how sun shining through a moon, roof 
Im a real nigga, nigga 
Big money, deal-getter 
I ain't fucking with these niggas wearing Tommy Hilfiger
