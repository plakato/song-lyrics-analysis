New Jack Swing Lyrics
by Wreckx-N-Effect.

Yo Wreckx-N-Effect 
In full effect, 
 
It's, the New Jack Swing, 
Was it something wrong that she can clean. 
All you got ta do is c'mon and sing 
Word for word all the lyrics that I bring 
And. If you feel the swing in your body 
When you step in cool inside a party 
Watching, all the girls just bumping like hotties 
They, have humps that's better than Ferrari's 
So. I got ta try these 
Dancing with a girl on my lap. 
I was chancing, hoping she was the type for romancing 
But. My rap needed a little enhancing 
Because. This girl needed some answering 
Nothing. I said I started to complain and turning red 
Then. I told her just to be about Ted 
She gave a wink. 
But can't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing.

1-2-3. I named it New Jack Swing. 
Yes T.R. is my name 
Making you, girls do my thing 
It's the way I entertain baby 
I'm on the beat you like 
Yes, that's right, it's outta sight, 
All, the bumps are very high. 
Yes T.R. is grooving. It right. 
I got Keith, Sweat, Heavy D, 
To-day Mo Dee, 
B. Sure and my man Bobby Brown 
I got Cinnamon Redhead 
Boy George James 
Deejay and my hooome-booooys Guy 
 
Can't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing. 
 
Back to the matter. The New Jack Swing 
It's the sound that can flatter 
Even if the sound around town doesn't give a 
Same type of feeling that this one delivers 
So your body, shivers, 
So, bad, so dope, big metal thing. You wish you had 
Bumping your feeling from glad to sad. 
But, your not getting offensive 
Just chill and get whipped by the New Jack Swing.
