Drown Into Eternal Twilight Lyrics
by Xasthur.

Who they are, who they once were is what they fear.

In a new age without a planet to rebuild.
The end of the earth served as my rebirth.
It will fall to pieces.
Yet some await that dawn.
Falling of a weak empire that stood too long.
So be the voice of death to haunt me.
They'll open their window and they won't see their world anymore.
