Night of the Fires Lyrics
by Russ Moshavi Chara.

Ain't no racism in America, simple as that.
When i hear screams of fury, I know it's just bullcrap.
Black lives matter is obscene.
Part of Barack's fascist regime.
They've made you all a bunch of morons.
Now the fury's turned on.

Fuck BLM and fuck this fake narrative.
I can't believe how people believe all these piles of shit.
I'm totally pissed at you, after all we're on universal race.
But man, I ain't your brother, you're a fucking disgrace.

BLM is fear.
BLM is rape.
BLM is funeral pyre.

BLM is hate.
BLM's obscene.
Night of the fires.

Fuck your dad and your momma.
Jizzing on her face ain't no drama.
Fuck your kids, fuck your wife.
I can't believe someone gave you life.

BLM is fear.
BLM is rape.
BLM is funeral pyre.

BLM is hate.
BLM's obscene.
Night of the fires.

So Ain't no racism in America, simple as that.
When i hear screams of fury, I know it's just bullcrap.
Black lives matter is obscene.
Part of Barack's fascist regime.
They've made you all a bunch of morons.
Now the fury's turned on.

Fucking cunts on damn wheels.
Cops chasing you at your heels.
Hope you're crushed by car wheels.
Now you'll know just how it feels.

Ain't no racism in America, simple as that.
When i hear screams of fury, I know it's just bullcrap.
Black lives matter is obscene.
Part of Barack's fascist regime.
They've made you all a bunch of morons.
Now the fury's turned on.
