by Z-Man.

Z-Man 
Nothin, but bussin and cussin and rippin over sommmethin, tight 
Homie go hit. It get loose, 
Spittin and flippin, rippin, outrageously, and bomb on sight. 
Look at'em homie got glued 
Ready for any plenty infinity with they minds on the mic 
Lookin to get that juice. 
Arm me in semi, auto inside a bottle splashin through your ride. 
Homie you just got glued 
 
Tajai 
I could care less what you believe: 
What you percieve 
What you hold in high esteem. 
You ain't up in my league 
With each stride. It seems 
I'm uppin. My lead 
With each line, ya dreams. 
Of touching me flee 
My speech hit like the stuckiest weed 
Where. We 
Have you stuck in your seat. You bare breathe 
Is it you suckas, can't read: 
Or, don't understand what beware means: 
Frontin hard, like'y'all, dont, scare, me', 
The prime hit cha 
Attack from all sides of 99 dimensions: 
With rhymin, spine demention to lynch ya, 
Timbalands, drizzlin, on ya, temples; 
For that shit, you speak! 
 
Z-Man 
Anybody who's lips, loose, 
, 
Tajai, 
Scuffled and buckled up 
By, the knuckles till you drip and leak 
, 
Z-Man, 
Ah, huh homie. This means you 
 
Tajai, 
So, watch it 
I already cocked it 
I'm ready to pop it 
And can't none of y'all stop it. 
When, I start 
Rippin a pencil like its a pistol and just blastin off 
You know youre dealin wit, who 
Mic addicts see it. I grab it automatic 
Time to pay the piper his dues 
Hoppin, this pimpin pissin on all these pop powder, puffs

Z-Man 
What is y'all. Gon' do 
 
Tajai 
Stop, look and listen uplift it if it isn't loud enough,

Come one. Now you glued 
Don't forget the brag that be the slogan 
Bottom of the ocean: 
Octopus holdin your mermaid down. While I chew the tuna 
Thought, I was concious cuz, my appearance, 
I'm, a dread head red black and veggie ready for illin 
Call me Z-Man 
Stabbin on the scene. Beacuse there ain't one 
Spraycan, I hit the wall with a paintgun 
Whatchu doin eatin fly soup again 
Runnin into bullets, 
Who the fuck. You think you is superman, stupid, 
Yes or no 
You. Suckas are square like top of graduate hats, 
Talkin bout guns, dog runnin wit Sponge. Bob 
Fuck that shit load it up and let me have it 
Shoot me in front of mom shoot me in my casket 
There they go. 
Foes are goin frantic fighting over my dead rotting body 
'til. I get up in ya, area' 
Look, atcha boy with his pen on safety 
Plus. He got a mess, 
Takin baby steps to come and get wit, crutches 
Ready for any counterfit funny bunnies thinkin. They tight 
Step right up and get bruised 
Fuckin'em up and leavin'em dead pushin. Their shells to the side 
Now what the fuck you gon do: 
Throw on my beanie hoodie and burners, and proceed to 
Ready for all the next crew 
Word billy sincerely. Clearly, you feel pullin my boots out your ass 
Shine'em off and take two 
 
Tajai

You stuck 
Run up and get shut, 
Or shut up and run 
 
Z-Man 
You, fuckin, rabbits, 
I'll, chew you up and shit carrots 
Swallow your pidegon coop and spit parrots 
Are. You amazed or embarrassed 
 
Tajai 
You couldn't raise an eyebrow 
With that fugazi rhyme style 
Nowadays. We hostile 
Suckas, get dipped scraped and knocked out 
Man shutcha lips, just praise in

Buh huh, huh, huh, huh, hee, hee huh, oh 
Popeyes, chicken, eatin', exhaust breathin'

Girl. I tag Hieroglyphics all over your neck and nipples 
Fly as a hippo.
