Buck em Lyrics
by Zion I.

Yeah, you know sometimes I get caught up in the madness of the world.
But the homies told me then, look.
Logo, so I tried to, logo, logo.
Then I learn to.

Oh, going hard in attentions.
I'm scar for the boys that the thought from the benches to the parks.
Living through my art, in the car of seeing critics ripping me apart.
Scraping like a gladiator push me on your fador.
Trying to catch you grammy sucker now not later.
Rappin town like a rater but my neighbor stay trip.
Friends turn the haters hard hands they listen.
It's a serious condition expose to roll thicker.
Blood than water hard still tickin but the mind start slipping.
Hard to stay focused, keep it with the jams is the start feel hopeless.
Forgetting where you came from, cuttie how you've been.
Couldn't really talking had to put it tot he pen.
And I'm a loyal friend, but this is getting hard bra.
I remember when we used to match like a charger.

The homie told me to keep my head up.
It's kind of hard when I start and then fed up.
Really royce and we led up, shoot the sky down.
Time to get this bread up.
Buck 'em, buck 'em, get this bread up.
Buck 'em, buck 'em, get this bread up.
Buck 'em, buck 'em, get this bread up.
Buck 'em, buck 'em, get this bread up.

Uh I start to feel fresh played it.
My boy like you made it, Justin John that could...
Juice in how I flown but the natives.
He's doing what she's supposed to, you should got the haters.
And I'll be like you right on sitting on foes, foes.
Deep and slow meditating as a glow.
I'ma taking at the glow, the one that's travel.
Keep back in the lack, let the drama unravel.
Watch it like a movie but never be attached.
Break off another batch and his cookie take a sack.
And take it to your neck black, you should just respect that.
We moving out of love, justify to a click track.
Just another sick rat, this is for your health.
Life a long think it to yourself.
Cause eyes all we got I'm moving to the top.
I'm cooking up some vegetables eat em out my pot, don't stop.
When we rock...

The homie told me to keep my head up.
It's kind of hard when I start and then fed up.
Really royce and we led up, shoot the sky down.
Time to get this bread up.
Buck 'em, buck 'em, get this bread up.
Buck 'em, buck 'em, get this bread up.
Buck 'em, buck 'em, get this bread up.
Buck 'em, buck 'em, get this bread up.
