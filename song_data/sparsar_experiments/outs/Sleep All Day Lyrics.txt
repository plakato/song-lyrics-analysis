Sleep All Day Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Well I shouldn't sleep all day.
And waste the afternoon.
'Cuz I know if I'm up all night.
You'll be going to bed soon.

So wipe the sleep from your eyes.
And I'll wipe them out of mine, too.
And if we try to hold on.
Then I'll try to hold on to you.

Well I shouldn't sleep all day.
But it's half past noon.
'Cuz I know we're taking a break.
And I know you're leaving me soon.

So if you try to be nice.
Then I'll try to be nice to you.
And if you try to hold on.
Then I'll try to hold on to you.

So wipe the sleep from your eyes.
And I'll wipe them out of mine, too.
So if you try to be nice.
Then I'll try to be nice to you.

And I shouldn't sleep all day.
And waste the time with you.
'Cuz I know we're taking a break.
And I know we both need room.

So wipe the sleep from your eyes.
And I'll wipe them out of mine, too.
And if you try to hold on.
Then I'll try to hold on to you.
