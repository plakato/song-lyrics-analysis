Evacuatin' Somethin' Warm Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

Nick: something warm would be something nice.
To keep me from moaning in the morning.
And mourning through the night.

Alden: take your things from my house.
Evacuate my life.
It's over.
Rescind.

Nick: everything's okay in its own little way.

Alden: clap your hands/clap your hands.
Clap your hands if you want some.

Clap your hands/clap your hands.
Clap your hands if you can't wait.
