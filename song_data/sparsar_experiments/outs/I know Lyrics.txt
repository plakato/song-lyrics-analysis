That's a stack gone bitch.
Money ain't a thing.

Ice on my shirt I know.
Horseshoes on my pockets I know.
Got lean in my cup I know.
Got racks in my jeans I know.
Got a campaign yeah yeah I know.
Your girl wanna smash I know.
Horseshoes on her pockets I know.
Keep a bag on her arm I know.
All my bitches Oughta Know.
