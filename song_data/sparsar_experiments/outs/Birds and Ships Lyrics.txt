Birds and Ships Lyrics
by Billy Bragg and Wilco.


The birds are singing.
In your eyes today.
Sweet flowers blossom in your smile.
The wind and sun.
Are in the words you say.
Where might your lonesome lover be?
Birds may be singing.
In my eyes this day.
Sweet flowers blossom when I smile.
But my soul is stormy.
And my heart blows wild.
My sweetheart rides a ship on the sea.

Though my soul is stormy.
And my heart blows wild.
Where might my lonesome lover be.
