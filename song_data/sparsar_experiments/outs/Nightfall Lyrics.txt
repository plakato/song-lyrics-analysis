Nightfall Lyrics
by Xandria.

Here it comes, the story of mankind´s final glory.
Into the nightfall.
The showdown now has come, this will be the last curtain.
Before the Night falls.

In a desert burning children´s faces turning.
Into another enemy in war.
Icy winds are blowing over bodies piling high.
There´s no place left for more.

Oh save me from sharing this hell.
Oh save me from my blame.

We are worshipping the gods.
That keep twisting our thoughts.
Everyday a new sensation.
While a million creatures.
See their soil turning to dust.
Hrimata Eleison.

Forever and ever.
You hear them crying.
Forever and ever.
This world is dying.
We had time enough to understand.

We are rising higher, closer to the fire.
Let the final dance begin.
