Sunday Lunch Lyrics
by Xplicit Entertainment.


Cause everyday is a Sunday.
When I'm chilling with my baby.
You know she drives me crazy.
Lady....

The gyal bess.
like Sunday lunch.

The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
Sweet like a gyal.
in the Sunday Punch.
All the haters them, they're dunce.
Watch she once, she's a Sunday lunch.

The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
Sweet like a gyal in the Sunday Punch.
Men could say what they want.
From day 1, she's a Sunday lunch.

She's my Sunday lunch.
What.

Nobody bess like you.
They can't dress like you.
Impress like you, gyal.

Nobody style like you.
Them look fly like you.
Them wah try like.
you, gyal.

You know baby if I make a wish.
I would have you everyday just like my favourite dish.
Stew chicken,.
callaloo and.
macaroni pie.
Lentil peas,.
potato salad on the.
side.
Sunday afternoon, baby we could take a ride.
We'll be rolling around the island, you're my Bonnie I'm your Clyde.
Got me reminiscing, like the tapes with Dr. Hyde.
Cyah stop thinking 'bout you baby, got to be with you tonight, yeah.
Or we could take a drive down Chaguaramas.
I could see you in my future like Nostradamus.
Leave home the entourage, we don't need no drama.
Cause you're my all star like Panorama.

Cause everyday is a Sunday.
When I'm chilling with my baby.
You know she drives me crazy.
Lady....

The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
Sweet like a gyal in the Sunday Punch.
All the haters them, they're dunce.
Watch she once, she's a Sunday lunch.

The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
Sweet like a gyal in the Sunday Punch.
Men could say what they want.
From day 1, she's a Sunday lunch.

She's my Sunday lunch.
What.

Baby girl, you's the one for me.
So blind by love, but I want to see.
Your lovely smile, what a scene.
Make a young Trini say so comfortably.
That you are my lover lover.
I don't want another.
Jim Carrey bamsie, I go dumb and dumber.
When you start to bubble.
I say, Wa chubble?
I'm fresh to death, and I need a stunt double.
You're hotter than a pepper sauce on stew chicken and rice.
Me eh care. Who vex, lost; is so me like it, like Spice.
Nice.
My love, I'm stamping.
Cause you sweet, like plantain.
The haters, they're faling.
They're bitter, like tamarind.
Haha, damn it.
I don't know what else to say.
But you's my doux-doux darling.
My Sunday Lunch.

Cause everyday is a Sunday.
When I'm chilling with my baby.
You know she drives me crazy.
Lady....

The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
Sweet like a gyal in the Sunday Punch.
All the haters them, they're dunce.
Watch she once, she's a Sunday lunch.

The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
The gyal bess like Sunday lunch.
Sweet like a gyal in the Sunday Punch.
Men could say what they want.
From day 1, she's a Sunday lunch.

She's my Sunday lunch.
What.
