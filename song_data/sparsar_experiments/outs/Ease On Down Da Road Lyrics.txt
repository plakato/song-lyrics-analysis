Ease On Down Da Road Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.

Hey, yo Van, let them ho's know:.

I want the skins, and then I want the ends out your pocketbook.
And I ain't with ya on the stick-around.
I got a woman. This is just somethin' for the kick-around.
And I ain't ever been a lover.
But more like a one-night, one-nut brother.
Yeah, I'm known to bust a load.
Throw the rubber away, and get to easin' down the road.
The only reason I'm in it.
Is for the flow and to run your credit cards to the limit.
Cause if I'm giving up the weanie.
Then I think I deserve to sit inside you felini.
And I prefer your man not know.
That I'm pipin' ya down and spendin' homeboy's flow.
So just keep it on th dl.
So no one will know, so no one can go tell.
You keep giving up the honey-dip.
Cause you you won't get piped if you ain't right on the money tip.
It's three things I get here.
I get the money, get the honey, then get out like last year....
