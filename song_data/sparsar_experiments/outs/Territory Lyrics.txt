Territory Lyrics
by Vizual.


I will never sleep. 
This is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
Time to take the land? 
This? Is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
 
Wa-wa-wake up 
This? Is the battleground 
Sand glass drippin' 
I, hear the trumpet sound 
He's coming back 
Like a thief in the night 
Stay in the secret place, 
Without relations you'll die 
Secret life on the line, 
Having a good ride. 
Just know you're missing the U-Turn 
For your last good-byes 
Evil flowing through your veins, 
Devil's, bloodline, 
Still in my range Paganism 
Breaking. This curse, 
He doesn't rest 
He'll conjure those that left 
Blood of the Lamb paid, the price 
To paid my bills and my debt 
You may be saved, but not born again, 
Common sense, 
Is sin. Still the affection, Yahweh 
Could heal you from those sinuses 
 
I will never sleep. 
This is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
Time to take the land? 
This is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
 
Life's about me 
Is it really, though, 
Last time I checked, 
I can't tell the weather zone 
Got so much Pride 
That I'm fallin' down slow 
Swimming than I sunk 
I'm, drowning into the inner core 
Thought. I was so bad 
But. I failed sense. 
Can'T tell what was bad 
Living in sin. 
Call me brainwashed, 
Can't tell switch, is switch, 
Bad is good and good is bad. 
Mindset corrupted 
Pride comes before the fall 
Yea I fell 
Nobody to get me up, 
I call that a fail, 
Christ taught me to humble 
And. Now I stand well 
Now time to take control. 
Over, my inner cell 
 
I will never sleep. 
This is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
Time to take the land? 
This? Is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
 
I'm in control? My body is the spaceship 
My soul? Is the control station 
I need my boss Yahweh? My tour guide 
Without direction, I'm lost 
Breaking down suicide. 
His Word is direction. 
To find myself inside 
Food for my spirit. 
My passion multiplies 
Letting. This fire burn the seeds. 
That got my hands tide 
Look. At my face FREEDOM 
All over my whole life, 
 
I, will never sleep. 
This is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
Time to take the land? 
This is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
 
I will never sleep. 
This is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down 
Time to take the land? 
This? Is God's territory 
It's going down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down
