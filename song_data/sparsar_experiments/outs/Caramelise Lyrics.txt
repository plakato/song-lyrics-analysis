Caramelise Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


I've sung, that I'm not done.
How I live, lots of lives, Oh I'll hum.
Something glum, something wise, something dumb.
Oh I, oh I won a trip to insane.
Oh I, hope the world will be fed to my ex.

Gotta break, gotta fast for the morning love.
Gather round, we can caramelise in the morning sun.
Oh we gotta break, gotta fast for the morning love.
Gather round, we can caramelise in the morning sun.
Gotta break, gotta fast for the morning love.
Gather round, we can caramelise in the morning sun.
Gotta break, gotta fast for the morning love.
Gather round, we can caramelise in the morning sun.

The only song I know, is we only got our true love.
The only song I know, is we only got our true love.
Oh I, oh I won a trip to insane.
Oh I, hope the world will be fed to my ex.
