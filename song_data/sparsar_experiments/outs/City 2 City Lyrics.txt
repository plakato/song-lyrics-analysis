City 2 City Lyrics
by Zomboy.

City to city.
Were stepping on the same ground.
Make it loud.
Come listen to the sound like.

Whoa! Whoa!

Open our eyes.
Everyday in the sunlight.
Try try.
But don't always get it right like.

Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Tottaly, oh oh, this is a.

Tottaly, oh oh, this is.

Whoa!

Whoa!

City to city.
Were stepping on the same ground.
Make it loud.
Come listen to the sound like.

Whoa! Whoa!

Open our eyes.
Everyday in the sunlight.
Try try.
But don't always get it right like.

Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Tottaly, oh oh, this is a.

Tottaly, oh oh, this is.

City to City.

City to City.
