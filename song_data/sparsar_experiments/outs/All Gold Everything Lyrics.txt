All Gold Everything Lyrics
by Tyga.

Gold, all in my chain, gold, all in my ring 
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch 
Nigga, nigga nigga. Don'T believe me just watch 
Don't! Believe me just watch nigga, nigga, nigga 
Don't. Believe me just watch bitch. Don'T believe me just watch 
Gold. All in my chain, gold - all in my ring 
Gold all in my watch - don't believe me just watch 
 
T-Raww. I don't fuck with niggas 
My money, long, my temper, midget 
King gold chains. I reinvented 
This gold shit, you, a gold, fish, nigga 
Try me 4 kings. Like free sale, nigga 
Sippin' out a cup like a toddler, nigga nigga 
Who, the fuck want drama pain, 
Back got it like a chiropractor mane 
Got that nigga rock quarter mill and chain 
Got score at your lights stakes a lane: 
Nigga nigga sunroof, your brain 
Claim that You drink, but you can't even hang 
Only came cause a nigga got paid 
Sleep with them. Hoes they gon fuck up your name name 
Pop, the zanny, I'm stressin woo pop the molly, I'm flexin, woo 
Dre Beats my beats. Bang biker jeans ball me 
She, suck me off till I'm all drained 
Kick her out Lu Kang 
Wide body need two lanes got a five: oh four bitch go to Tulane, 
 
Niggas! Think that I'm playing I ain't, saying it just to be saying it and nigga
make your bed laying in ... 
 
Born sinner, make a nigga die for his dinner 
Eyes of a tiger stone, killer, cold blooded. When I 
Fucking beast, goin' ham got ta eat 
Thanksgivin. Don'T thank me cause that ain't, beef, 
Yall niggas, sweet money, leech money laundering, 
Private jet. I don't fly economy, 
, 
Man I'll, make it rain. While you niggas tryin, maintain 
All my niggas gang bang shout out Honey Cocaine, 
 
Last Kings, ymcmb, bitch 
One. Eighty seven stay on some G shit, 
 
Gold, all in my chain, gold. All in my ring 
Gold. All in my watch, don't believe me just watch 
Nigga, nigga nigga. Don'T believe me just watch 
Don't! Believe me just watch nigga, nigga, nigga 
Don't. Believe me just watch. Don'T believe me just watch 
Gold all in my chain, gold, all in my ring 
Gold. All in my watch, don't believe me just watch.
