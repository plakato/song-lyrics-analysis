Wrong One Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

Yea it's the old saying, don't mistake kindness for weakness.
I'll punch your mother's stomach through her throat and then eat it.
I'm the guru of merking.
Working like a premier plastic surgeon.
Wait....
Cause I still stay on the tit-op!
Go to Venice wearing flip flops over tube socks.
Go to bars with a tec and ask a girl to do shots.
Jump in swimming pools, ask to join the dive team.
And grease up the footholds so the swimmers end up dieeeeeving.
See I'm the wrong one to be stepping to.
My word is bond, so just try to try see what's left of you.
I'm always right, I don't think I've ever been wrong.
Left for dead four times, survival is my theme song!
Wicked wordplay and feisty foreplay.
I'll claw you on the mat bitch, cause rhyming is my forte.
And this is written and recorded all in one day.
So in my mind that sums it up, there's really nothing more to say.
