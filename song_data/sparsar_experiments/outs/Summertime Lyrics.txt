Summertime Lyrics
by The Zombies.

It's summertime.
And the living is easy.
The fish are jumping.
And the cotton is high.
Your daddy's rich.
And your mama's good looking.
Won't you hush, pretty baby.
Don't you cry.

One of these mornings.
You're going to wake up singing.
There you're going to spread your wings.
And take to the sky.
But 'til that morning.
Ain't nothing, nothing going to harm you.
With your mommy and daddy.
There standing by.

It's summertime.
And the living is easy.
The fish are jumping.
And the cotton is high.
Your daddy's rich.
And your mama's good looking.
Won't you hush, pretty baby.
Don't you cry.
