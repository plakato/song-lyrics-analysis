Can't Stop Now Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

We can't stop now.
We've come too far.
There's a light up ahead but it's not where we are.
And I'm no good at being on my own.
Well together we're worse off than being alone.
It's hard to face.
But we can't go on like this.
Can't you see us burning down.
And all it takes is everything we've got.
But somehow we can't stop.
We can't stop now.
We're as good as gone.
Yeah we pulled apart when we used to belong.
Fortune finds those who wait.
Yeah we knew what we had.
We just got it too late.
It's hard to face.
But we can't go on like this.
Can't you see us burning down.
And all it takes is everything we've got.
But somehow we can't stop.
We can't stop.
We can't stop.
Oh yeah.
Oh it's hard to face.
But we can't go on like this.
Can't you see us burning down.
We're burning down.
And all it takes is everything we've got.
But somehow we can't stop.
No, somehow we can't stop.
We can't stop now.
We've come too far.
There's a light up ahead but it's not where we are.
