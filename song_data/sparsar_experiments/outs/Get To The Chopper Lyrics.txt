Get To The Chopper Lyrics
by Sydney.

See you for all the right reasons.
I, will hide the truth behind lies.
See you with good intentions.
We'll see who's laughing, we'll see who's laughing.

Conversation.
In a pitch black devils night everyone is loaded.
I can barely breath, forever will end in time.
This is how I will deal with the things I've done.

Forty hours left, a step down from the way we've been.
And now you're just a broken habit.
In a world that just won't have it anymore.
Sit back and let it all go down.
Eyes closed and the whole world spinning.
You think you control it but the devil made me do it just won't.

Can we still, convince them?

From the fact that we're so complicated.
It would suit us both better if we spent the time apart.
Last chance that everyone has to be free.
Cause it happens everyday.

So long, So long.

I hear jenny in the back say she's having problems.
She was searching through herself she was looking for the answer.
I said no ones gonna come back in the end.
Because I am your best mistake I will never let you down.

Is that what you wanted? Is that what you needed?
Because i know its gonna come back in the end.
Until then I've gotta save them.

Can we still, convince them?

From the fact that we're so complicated.
It would suit us both better if we spent the time apart.
Last chance that everyone has to be free.
Cause it happens everyday.

So long, and thanks but i will move on.
These past few weeks they will be free.
So long, and thanks but i will move on.
So drive fast you've gotta drive faster.
I told you from the start i would never hold you back girl.

Can we still, convince them?

From the fact that we're so complicated.
It would suit us both better if we spent the time apart.
Last chance that everyone has to be free.
Cause it happens everyday!
