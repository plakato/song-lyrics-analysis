If I... Lyrics
by Cyrus Da Virus.


If I 
Make a 
Mistake 
Should I 
Try and 
Pretend 
Or 
Should. I 
Brush myself 
Back off 
Before. I 
Try it again. 
This whole 
Underground, 
Metropolis 
Is dieing 
To, spend 
Money on 
Watered down 
Performers now 
So, where 
Will it end. 
I, don't know 
It all 
Depends 
And 
Maybe. It won't 
Me and 
My kind 
Are, just 
Surving 
But their 
Killing us slow 
If. I 
Was 
Rapping bout, 
Bones 
And, expensive, 
Clothes 
And, Making reference 
To some places 
That. I don't 
Even go 
Renting 
Mercedes 
For, my video 
To sit in 
And pose 
Getting sum: 
N dubz love 
When, I'm out 
On da road 
Would. I 
Still be 
Persistant 
Considered 
As, cold 
If, I 
Decided 
Now 
It's time. 
To start 
Stepping 
On toes 
 
If. I 
Stick to da 
Norm 
Try comply 
And conform, 
Become, a 
Yes man, 
I'n society, 
A, menace 
No, more 
Keeping, my 
Thoughts 
To myself, 
Only 
Speaking 
When, I'm 
Spoken to 
If I 
Should 
Play 
Da game Of life, 
Twice 
And 
Both times loose 
Choose 
To Bring 
DA pain, 
Go Against 
Da grain 
I know that 
Babylons 
Blood 
Ain't Running 
Through 
My veins 
If. I 
Decide to 
Break 
Da chain 
Make, my 
Claim 
To fame 
I guarantee 
That 
Everybodys, 
 Gon na know, 
My name 
If. I 
Try and 
Endure 
Get more 
Deeper within thins 
Put, my 
Foot i'n da door 
So. I can 
Kick it. 
Off 
It's hinges: 
Wid, more 
Broken, English 
Than, 
Before 
To, witness 
I, recommend 
You, tell 
A Freind 
Quick 
Try 
Not to 
Miss this 
If I 
 
If. I 
Should 
Wait 
Too long 
Before 
Releasing this song 
I know my 
Whole 
Master plan. 
Could go 
Dramatically wrong, 
Da compilation, 
That, I'm making now 
It has to be strong, 
Wid all da 
Characteristics 
Of, a 
Hydrogen bomb 
Cuz. If I 
Don't even try 
To apply 
Myself 
Then I'll, be 
Stuck 
Wid, a album 
That, I'm 
Trying to sell 
And. If I 
Speech you 
Jus to 
Buy it 
One day, 
On the road 
Then you'll be 
Kicking yourself, 
Crying 
When, you play it 
At home 
If. I can 
Only achieve 
Half da things 
I'm due 
Aswell as 
25 thousand 
Views 
On YouTube 
Extensive 
Air play 
And, 
Magazine reviews, 
So, manny, 
Opportunities 
I, Wouldn't know 
What to choose
