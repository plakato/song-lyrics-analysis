Poison Ivy.
Produced By. Vo-Kal &amp; DropXLife.

Tried to give you my all.
You tore me apart at the seams babe.
For your type I fall.
So hard on my knees baby.
I won't.
Say that.
We were meant to be.
I'm just.
Pleading.
That you are what I need.

Baby your poison.
The way that your taking me under.
Baby your poison.
You got me fading.
Baby your poison.

Maybe baby.
You aren't.
Poison to me.
The things I do.
Are what's.
Killing me.
How can I.
See you.
See you again.
Will you be gone.
My personal sin.
I'll always be here.
Waiting for you.
To call.
Cause I'm what you need.

Baby your poison.
You got me fading.
I'm lost in your love.
Baby your poison.
Baby I'm faded.
Please don't hang up.
Baby your poison.
