Books Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Hip shoot, make me feel bad.
Here's the love, come and fill it with your motion.
Wild eyed kids understand.
When you're alone you're a river not an ocean.
When the sun needs a sacrifice.
She'll be there with a fool to offer up.
Gotta make it to a paradise for our own survival.

Set fire to the books that you read.
I wanna see 'em burning up.
Let go of the dreams that you had.

Milk teeth, paint me in rags.
Gimme soul from the rhythm of your beatings.
Wild eyed kids understand.
When you're alone nothings easy to believe in.
When it calls it'll come to you.
It'll come when it's you that's calling up.
When it falls it'll fall to you.
For your own survival.

Overflowing futures.
Dying in a distant dream.
If only I could move ya.
We could make it feel so real.
And if we're killing all of our friends.
To make another TV show.
Ya know that holy rivers don't end.
We've gotta let the fires grow.
