Green Conduit Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Dreams of a place that my father has seen.
Where the farmers and the gardeners have no king.
What he saw was unmistakable.
And it happened at a time of pure content.
He gave his job at the M.O.D.
24 years old he flowered.
My old man was a gardener, asking.
Why the fuck have we got thumbs?

I know, I know why.
I know, I know why.
I know, I know why.
Now I know I know why.

He had a great green appetite, asked.
When does gold turn silver?
Then a message came through the green conduit.
What he saw was a leprechaun.
It let him know that we're not far.
From a different world and this story from my dad.
Was one great tale that reeked of hope.

I know, I know why.
I know, I know why.
I know, I know why.
Now I know I know why.
I know, I know.
