...About A Girl Lyrics
by Voltaire.

You learn a lot about a girl.
The way that you meet her.
Was she with a guy when you met her?
How did she treat him?
Was she lying to her man.
To be out holding your hand?
Yeah, you learn a lot about a girl.

Do you really believe that with you.
It will be different?
Man, listen to me I did that too.
Now it's here that I'm missing.
I'm a guy that she lied to.
Soon enough that guy will be you.
Yeah, you learn a lot about a girl.

Was it a nice, clean, even split.
Before you and she got into it?
Yeah, you learn a lot about a girl.

Now here's a fact that is true.
All men are dumb, and women are crazy.
Hey, open your eyes.
If you don't see this you're just being lazy.
She's no saint as you can see.
Cause she's out with you.
While she's living with me.
Yeah, you learn a lot.
Don't think you will not.
Yeah, you learn a lot about a girl.
