Your Body Is a Weapon Lyrics
by The Wombats.


Sometimes I like to go uptown.
Where flashy people flash around.
It's extortionate and I don't care.
You can taste the pretence in the air.
And I wonder what you'll wear tonight.
The shiny black dress with the slit at the thigh?
Is this such fantasy that I should think.
Someone like you could love a creep like me?

Your body is a weapon, love.
And it makes me wanna cry.
My body is a temple of doom.
Doomed not to be by your side.

I like my job when I do it well.
It's freelance work and it pays like hell.
But I can get us a place with one bedroom.
Who needs a friend when I've got you?

Your body is a weapon, love.
And it makes me wanna cry.
My body is a temple of doom.
Doomed not to be by your side.

And I don't come here for the exclusivity.
I just come here for the view.
And the minuscule chance of some close proximity.
Or an awkward conversation with you.
Yeah that'd be cool.

Your body is a weapon, love.
And it rips me up inside.
My body is a temple of doom.
Doomed not to be.
Doomed not to be by your side.

Someone protect me from the one I love.
Someone protect me from the one I love.
Someone protect me from the one I love.
Someone protect me from the one I, one I love.

Someone protect me from the one I love.
Someone protect me from the one I love.
Someone protect me from the one I love.
Someone protect me from the one I, one I love.

Someone protect me from the one I love.
Someone protect me from the one I love.
Someone protect me from the one I, one I love.
