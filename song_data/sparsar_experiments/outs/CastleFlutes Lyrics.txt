CastleFlutes Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


I'm just doing what I do.
Smoking weed with a brew.
In a all white castle.
As I hear the fucking flutes.
I just wanna make my loot.
As i tell y'all the truth.
And my phone bout to die.
So your calls ain't on route.
Imma probably cop a coupe.
Just to flex with the crew.
Me &amp; my nigga Bones smoking backwoods til we puke.
I can't hear what you sayin' got your life on mute.
Playin' footsies with your girl while we wrapped under a quilt!

On &amp; on we go.
And all I hear is on &amp; on she go.

I'm Casey, I'm JoJo.
I'm crazy, I'm loco.
These bitches look like Yoko.
Oh no, they so gone.
I'm so dead, I'm cash.
I'm rollin blunts so I mack.
I'm feelin something like Young Dro the way the rubberbands just snap.

It's the white Mike Jones, so they blowin up my phone.
Coming down, just a young dumb fuck who could flow.
I don't need your respect, I don't need your connect.
All i need is some drugs and some woods for my nest.

I don't wanna wake up.
I don't wanna wake up if you're not right here.

All you knuckleheads is hella scared.
Y'all stupid y'all can't deal with this.
I'm killin I will get with this so easily I do this shit.
Why you niggas tryna be like me, you need to stop that shit.
Y'all need to quit that shit so fuckin quick cuz y'all is ugly bitch.
I don't give a fuck about how you feel or your fucking clothes.
Nigga you can get your lame ass up out the door.
Every time you see me I be with my fleet.
And we be so damn clean.
You be like god damn man.
And your girl be like damn.
I wanna be with them.
Can we chill can we smoke or something.
I be like Hell naw bitch.
I got priorities that don't include you.
And I'm doing what I gotta do for me &amp; my crew.
