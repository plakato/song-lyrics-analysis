Dry Your Eyes Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man 
Girl there's something that's telling me 
That you're in need of company 
And. You need it now. 
So, I'm willing to comfort. You 
For, all all the pain that you're going through 
So baby, don't ...

3rd, Storee, 
1- Girl. Don'T cry dry, your eyes! 
You! Don'T have to be alone, 
I'll be there for you, 
Girl, don't cry dry, your eyes, 
If, there's anything that you need. 
Come, get it from me: 
 
Lil'Man, 
And, everyday, that passes by darling. I cry 
For. Every tear that draws from your eye. 
So baby. Don'T baby! Don'T 
Don't, you worry cause I'll, be here,

I said, call me: if you need a real man, I'm â€˜round 
If, you ever in need of a man with sensitivity. Call me 
Baby, it's driving me crazy to see you cry.
