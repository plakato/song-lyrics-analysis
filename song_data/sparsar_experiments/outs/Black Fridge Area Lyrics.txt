Black Fridge Area Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


So you say you've been abducted.
More times than you can count.
You take the hand sanitizer.
And squeeze it in your mouth.
Now just to tide you over.
Bend you backwards.

Secondary to the punch line.
What a fucking joke.
Happiness is leaping off of the porch.
Going all kinds of broke until it's fallen over.
Bending backwards.
Falling over.
You can drive if you want.
You know we never make it quite that far along.
But I kept cool cause I've been sleeping in the black fridge area.
To crack the case and fill it up with limn and slime now just to tide me over.

Bend me backwards.
So when you find that special somebody and you're ready to say.
Goodbye to their good side I know it's right.
You better hope and pray.
That you mean it.
But I kept cool cause I've been sleeping in the black fridge area.
To crack the case and fill it up with limn and slime now.
