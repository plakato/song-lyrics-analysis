Slave To Love Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

You're the hunter, I'm the game.
Since we've met, I'm not the same.
The hunger in you can't be satisfied.
You had a secret strategy.
To take control and capture me.
I lost my will and now I'm paralyzed.
Been made a slave to love, that's what I'll always be.
A victim of your touch, you stole my soul.
And now I'm just a slave to love, yeah.
It took one night at your hotel.
To fall from grace into your spell.
I can't believe you brought me to my knees.
You kiss me once and love me twice.
I'm on your mental sacrifice.
Your target's touch was hot and aim to please.
Been made a slave to love, that's what I'll always be.
A victim of your touch, you stole my soul.
And now I'm just a slave to love.
Oh, I'm being used.
Been held hostage for so long.
Is this a one way love affair, really wrong.
Been made a slave to love, that's what I'll always be.
A victim of your touch, you stole my soul.
And now I'm just a slave to love, just a slave to love.
Just a slave to love, ooh.
A victim of your touch.
