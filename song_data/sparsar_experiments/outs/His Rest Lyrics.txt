His Rest Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

To enter his rest.
To enter his rest.
Close to his chest.
And after his own heart.
Shepherds enter at measure 33, 33.
One foot on land.
And one upon the sea.
She holds them close.
Careful to enter his rest.
Threshing out what she had gleaned.
Of my kinsman redeemer.
She did dream.
To enter his rest.
To enter his rest.
She whispers as an aspen tree.
In her windy, windy way.
Bringing fruit and flowers to me.
Placed in vessels of clay.
She holds them close.
Grateful to enter his rest.
Threshing out what she had gleaned.
Of my kinsman redeemer.
She did dream.
To enter his rest.
To enter his rest.
