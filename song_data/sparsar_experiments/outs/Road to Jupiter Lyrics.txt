Road to Jupiter Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


I'm on the road to Jupiter's light.
The crown of gold, adorned with fire.
And when I look up into the night.
I hear its voice from starlit skies.
Down here on earth, the world is not bright.
But still it shines beyond the veil.
And when I look up into the night.
The stars, they glow to lead me there.

Carry me on, it won't be long 'till night arrives.
And all the sky is filling with light and heavenly wonders.
After the dawn, when night is gone and day will rise.
I know inside that Jupiter's star will still shine brightly, now.

I'm on the road to beautiful skies.
To heaven's gates and lofty sights.
The stars surrounding everything bright.
Like clouds come low will gently rise.
In golden arcs the daylight will fall.
Upon the face of all who see.
So even then, the darkness of night.
Cannot conceal its purity.

I'm on the road to Jupiter's light.
Although it's far, I now can see.
And when I look up into the night.
All of these stars, they're shining down on me.
So now in beauty and in right.
I will watch the sun give life.
Carried high into the day.
And when the morning dies at night.
I will run and spread this light.
With the stars that fill my wake.
