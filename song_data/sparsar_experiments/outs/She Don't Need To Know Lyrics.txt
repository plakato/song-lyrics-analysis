She Don't Need To Know Lyrics
by Yung Jake.


I'm with my niggas, we bout to go in.
Look at all of these women I'm with and all of they friends.
All of this money man, got me balling for real.
Like I play for the Bills, like I play for the Steelers.
I play for them millions, y'all play for fun.
I'm with these hoes, but they not the one.
My bae stay at home and she don't need to come.
Not I'm off with these hoes and all of these drugs.
Off these pharmaceuticals and weed in my lungs.
Texting all these bitches man, I'm hurting my thumbs.
She don't need to know, no, she don't know my passcode.
She don't wanna know it, she ain't like my last ho.
So she leaves that shit alone, cause she don't need to know.
All these pictures bitches sending me is all in my phone.

She don't need to know, no, she don't need to know.
I'm with some nigga's ho, and she don't need to know.
I just left the club, bout to put on some cologne.
To cover up the smoke of all the weed I blow.
She don't need to know, no, she don't need to know.
I do it on the low, but she don't need to know.
Out here on my lonely, so she can stay at home.
She leave that life alone, she don't need to know.

Now that I got this money man, my life is so different.
These bitches keep coming, and they so co-dependent.
All this snow and these trees, everyday feels like Christmas.
I should copyright my swag, niggas stealing my image.
They try to steal my bitches, but it ain't gonna work.
I'm not an employee, but I got that work.
My vision is blurry, I'm beat like ?
I ain't a judge, but I got on the jury.
I ain't rushing home cause I'm not in no hurry.
My bitch back at home and she ain't even worried.
I'm about to do some stupid shit, I'm Chris Brown.
Wife a bitch up and kick a bitch out.
Deleted all her texts, she won't even find out.
She don't even know, ain't nothing to lie about.

She don't need to know, she just left my show.
With some nigga ho, that she ain't even know.
