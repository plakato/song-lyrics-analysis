ObsidianTears Lyrics
by Zulu.


Funeral pyres burning brilliant with love lost.
Casting ash and everything's in grey.
Sun coalesced with the moon, open wound.
Songbirds chirp indifferent to the day.
Past pains dance in the wisp of my cigarette.
Vignettes soon carried off by the rain.
Tell tell hearts in my inbox rot.
Not a beep from the phone, just the tock of the clock.
Only confidant is a Ouija board.
Watch teardrops fall on their own accord.
Her words hit my frame like poison darts.
Gondola rendezvous on the rivers of my heart.
Got a call at two, she took the blue pill.

Cries echoed out from the booth to the back pew.
Said she never found love, I guess I didn't too.
