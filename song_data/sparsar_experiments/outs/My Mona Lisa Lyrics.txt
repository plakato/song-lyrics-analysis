My Mona Lisa Lyrics
by Viza.


My Mona Lisa! My Mona Lisa!
I swept the walls in pursuit of a virgin girl.
My Mona Lisa! My Mona Lisa!
I left Madonna for a glimpse of this manly girl.

Walk past the watchman.
Run past the fountains.
Hello little children.
Smile at the cameras.
Don't forget your aspirin.
You could make this happen.
We can make this happen.

Stay with me.
If you wish to hide your face.
If you wish to spend your days.
Staring out my window.

You should take an aspirin.
Soon we'll have our mansion.
No one thinks it's stolen.
Even if it's stolen.
We should move to Belgium.
Maybe even London.
Where the hell is London.
I never heard of London.
