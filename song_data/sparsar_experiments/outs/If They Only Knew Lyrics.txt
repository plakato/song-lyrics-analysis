If They Only Knew Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

I could love you for the rest of my life.
Set it off right, you be my wife.
We make moves  dang if they only knew.
Ill never hurt you.

They say you do me wrong.
They say I can't be strong.
Are we the only ones who.
All: Can see what's goin' on?
They say that you and me.
Were never meant to be.
I wish that they knew about our love.
How much you mean to me.

I was the only one to ever wanna be.
The kind of man to take your hand and love you.
Faithfully....

Why don't they just try, try and realize that you make.
It all right when you look in to my eyes.
Wish they can see what you do to me.
If they knew how I feel.
I'm still in love with you..

They don't see what I see.
They don't see you and me.
They think?? Made of crystal and diamond rings.
They need to realize.
That when I see your eyes.
It makes me happy just be in you life.

Deeper Inside.
It's more that it seems.
If they only knew you're the girl of my dreams, baby.

I got love for You.
Your mom says forget it you will never be a lawyer.
Thinkin' bout the time back when I first saw you.
Back in Junior High School Beaten Tom Soya.
I saw yea.
Now, Many Playa hatin' Because they.
Think I'm out Partyin.
Cops hear my aver ain't and handed me a card again.
Life was a shortly, shouldn't be so roughi love you.
So should that be enough.
Come on.

Why ay....................
Why? Why, Why, Why Baby.
I wish they can see what you do to me Baby.
I wish they can stick to our life's BabyOhh.
Girlwhy don't they just try.
Do to me, do to me Girl.
I know that I'm young Yea.
But I know it's in my heart.
