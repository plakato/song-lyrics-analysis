Suicyde Lyrics
by 51.50.


Somebody help me, I'm thinkin' I can't cope.
Early in the mornin, looked in the mirror and seen myself hangin' from a rope.
And it got me in a fucked up state of mind.
I'm havin' thoughts of blowin' my brains out from time to time.
I often feel like I'm livin' on the run.
And I'm straight nervous, paranoid, so I'm sleepin' with a gun.
I close my eyes and I can hear them bitches screamin'.
I'm wide awake and yet it feels like I am dreamin'.
What should I do, I think I need a head Shrink.
Every time a killin' is done, I write it down in blood not ink.
I always wanna take my own life, put a bullet in my dome.
Maybe that will make me feel right.

Instead of homicide I feel like suicide.
Somebody help me.
Instead of homicide I feel like commitin' suicide.
Instead of homicide I feel like suicide.
Somebody help me.

I'm 'noid as fuck, I'm havin' nightmares cause of what I've done.
I killed this fool for no muthafuckin' reason.
Was there a motive behind it?
Not that I know of, all I can say is that that muthafucka reminded.
Me of this trick I had big funk with.
So I snuck up on that mark and let the muthafuckin' pump kick.
Gauge blast, peeled his muthafuckin' cap back.
And later on that night I'm askin' myself, why did I do that?
I should have knew that nigga wasn't him.
With no remorse I smoke a blunt and kill a fifth of that Henn, then.
Went to sleep, now I'm seein' this nigga in my dreams.
Wish I was dead, one in the head.
Somebody help me.

Now I'm paranoid, body shiverin, got me wakin' up in a cold sweat.
I grab my gun, put it to my dome, wonderin' if I should just die yet.
These voices in my head keep tellin' me to pull it.
And to my own muthafuckin' brain it's like I'm goin' insane.
Feel like I'm looney, a nigga be gettin' psychotic thoughts.
I'd rather be takin' a quick way out than gettin' caught by the law.
Then spend the rest of my life ... locked in a cell.
My father say I'm sick in the head, ....
So what the fuck am I to do to get up outta this shit.
Put a hot one in the chamber, let the nina go click.
