Ain't No Good Life Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.


Ain't no good life.
Not the one that I lead.
Because the more I fight the sadness, yeah.
It only seems the more that I grieve.
Well I look back on the good times.
As some lost part of me.
I want to know, tell me why is it so.
Well just because I don't pray.
Lord, that don't mean I ain't forgiven.
Just because I'm alive.
That don't mean I'm making a living.
I'm going to get myself together.
I'm going to try a dying attempt.
Talking about the good times slipping by.
Yeah I tell ya.
I don't even know where last month went.
Well I can't make no money baby.
Well because my money's already spent.
And I know where it went.
I said it went on that damn rent.
Well I don't mean change, baby.
I mean folding money.
Well I want loving, said I don't need a buddy.
I don't need nobody, now.

Ain't exactly my idea.
Its sort of old, borrowed and blue.
Just trying to say.
Don't try that straight life buddy.
Oh you'll find it kind of hard on you.
Women, don't try to cook nothing up, ooh.
Brother you know you'll only wind up in your own stew.
Just don't let nobody tell you, oh what you oughta do.
