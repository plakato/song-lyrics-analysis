Broken Angel Lyrics
by Arash.

I'm so lonely broken angel.
I'm so lonely listen to my heart.

Man dooset daram:.
I've loved you.
Be cheshme man gerye nade:.
Don't give cry to my eyes.
Na, nemitoonam:.
No, i can't.
Bedoone to halam bade:.
Without you i'm depressed.

I'm so lonely broken angel.
I'm so lonely listen to my heart.

On n' lonley, broken angel.
Come n' save me before i fall apart.

To harja ke bashi kenaretam:.
Wherever you be, i'm beside you.
Ta akharesh divoonatam:.
To the end , i'm psychotic of you.
To , to nemidooni , ke joonami , bargard pisham :.
You , you don't know , that you are my life , come back foreside me.
La la leyli , la la leyli , la laaa :.
It doesn't have any purporst !
