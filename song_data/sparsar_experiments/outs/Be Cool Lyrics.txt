Be Cool Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


Young nigga more bucks, all black chucks.
Ride with your boy as a nigga get bucks.
See I'm ducked in the cut cause you know that I be chilling.
My crew full of niggas but I kick it with the women.
No limit, and I think mami Brazilian.
Little do she know I will never catch feelings.
Even if you throw them, I will never catch feelings.
Young nigga in the building steez level on a million.
Sit back and relax cause you talking too much.
My third eye open, I don't fuck.
with a slut.
Keep a cute redbone and my hand on her butt.
And some niggas on my side with a 9 that will bust.
Never giving it up, never giving a fuck.
And I don't want shit unless you giving me bucks.
So, tell me how you want it, no killer.
But guaranteed I will have his fucking head by the morning.
You ain't know now you do, pussy sweet like juice.
Leave a hole in sweet niggas like a fucking fruit loop.
I get head like bluetooths, I would hope you do too.
Stop worrying about a nigga like it's hard to do you.

See my niggas on my side, be cool.
Nigga don't you fuck up my vibe, be cool.
I don't call them goons but they do tote the tool.
See the mami's on my side, be cool.
I can't let you fuck up they vibe, be cool.
I don't call them goons but they do tote the tool.
