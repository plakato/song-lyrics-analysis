Today's Rebellion
by The Virus.


Each day you live in rebellion, there by guarantee.
Yourself another day of freedom, another to live and.
Another day to choose who your gonna be the only.
Thing they can't take away from you is your will to.
Survive today's rebellion is tomorrow freedom.

So much tension in the air - you won't know what f**king hit you.
Nobody seems to even care - no one's left there to assist you.
Ignore it and will go away - you earn your rights and solve your problems.
Can't deal with it another day - this f**ked up system has gotta be taken down.

No Society.
F**ck you and your society.

This world's become an evil place - people starving children dying.
Who will save the human race - the system fails by always lying.
Problems can't be left alone - now it's time to take some action.
They're in my work and in my home - no time for fractions this is f**king war.

No Society.
F**k you and your society.

Today's Rebellion, Tomorrow's freedom.

So much tension in the air - nobody even seems to care.
Ignore it and it won't go away - I can't deal with this another day.
