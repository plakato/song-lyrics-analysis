Jacques Cousteau Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

So I guess I got a little ways to go.
I keep movin' even if it's slow, I don't know.
But these days just ain't the same as before.
Drew a line, this is yours and this is mine.
Ain't nobody gonna take my side but they lie.
And they talk big talk with numbers and charts.
And they built some big walls in front of your heart.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight and that's alright.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
I, I don't wanna make you try.
I don't wanna be the reason why to comply.
So I'll be gone before you open your eyes.
And you'll see I took you too seriously.
Is anybody who they really seem to be lately?
I'm on a long walk back to the start.
And you got a back-bone falling apart.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight and that's alright.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
I'm on a long walk back to the start.
And you got a back-bone falling apart.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight and that's alright.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
It's gonna be a little lonesome tonight.
