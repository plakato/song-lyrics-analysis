Perfect Day - feat. Anuhea [Full Version] Lyrics
by Awa.

My perfect day would be you in my arms 
Watching, the sunrise 
Feel mellow sun rays, slipping through the palms 
Echoing, your design, 
Sharing, our dreams, 
Free and naive, 
While drifting deeper into your eyes, 
Make love to me. My baby 
And tell me you'll forever, be mine, 
Me tātari, tonu, māua', 
I te āio, o te aroha 
Kia kotahi, ai te, wairua 
Mo, āke, tonu, 
If. There'S one thing I know: 
You are my only 
You. Have my heart: 
My love will never roam. 
It will never fade away 
You're my perfect day, 
Anuhea 
My perfect day, would be in your arms 
Watching. The birds fly by 
Hearing sweet melodies 
Vibin' through the sky, 
Singing a love song for you and me 
Sharing our dreams 
Letting time slip away. 
Tell me is this love that I'm feeling 
Show love to me. My honey 
And tell me and tell me you'll forever: be mine, 
He aloha, wela, ko'u, mai, ke, Akua mai, la 
Komo'oe. I loko o ko'u moe'uhane 
He la hemolele, kēia', 
Aia, au ma na lani, 
Anuhea 
Today is ours and no one else's 
I. Thank the Lord for all His blessings: 
Mahalo ke Akua, no kēia la 
Awa 
You're, my symphony and I wan na listen 
Solely. My purpose for living 
Toku whaiāipo haere mai, 
Anuhea 
And - I don't even wan na try 
To be with another guy 
My baby you're perfect to me, 
So to you this song, I sing 
Awa 
Me tātari tonu māua' 
I te āio, o te aroha 
Anuhea 
He la hemolele, Kēia' 
Aia au ma na lani
