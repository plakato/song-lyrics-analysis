Checking in and out in ink Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Creeping in your dreams im see through.

Art is the perfect piece i have seened in years.

Working till my hands give out one switch turn off your lights.

Working on the pipes water leaking down the pipes rain drops falling down.

Nobody in this world is perfect but god.

Soil in the ground watering the plants till there dry.

Standing toilet paper holder in my in hands can't stand still right now.

Flying through with the fastest planes making my dreams real.

Time flying mins ticking.

I have the earthquake shaking the ground apart.

Shyt gets real by the day and night.

I have your girl dancing to the beats i make for her shit gets swallowed by.
the toilet paper holder.

Yes sir im gold for life heart is soild hard to melt.
