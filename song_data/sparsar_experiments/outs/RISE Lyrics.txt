RISE Lyrics
by UNIFIED GIANTS.

“RISE” by Unified Giants.

Unified Giants.
Nah mean.
Yeah.
Nam saying.

They let me in, and I will get that.
Get fat and give back.
Live good my dude we did that.
Call up my boo now lets splash.
And spend a little of this hard earned cash.
And yet I stash, for rainy days.
The ways of bad weather keep me chasing the pay.

Lacing boots, face the truth.
I grind for it making a move, and yet I'm cool as cool is.
Knowing that I does what the real do.
I show and prove, leaving proof… that I'm worth it.

With hopes for better… here... Cursing the curses.

Another day, more money to earn.
I'm in the front; you have to wait your turn.
Not trying to lose because I've been done learned.
That talk is cheaper than some matches to burn.

So I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.

So I get up and get going.
Knowing its me that's trying to own it.
I'm out to earn it, that's what we knowing.
Working 9 to 5, nothing but time with grind to realize that.
Your out for you, I'm out for mine.
Yo, that's how we do that here.
I want it all maybe that ain't fair.
Your mouth a lie saying I don't share.
You want to hate on me I don't care.
And I swear, we gone do it.
Through hard times… I find the blue print.
To up and use it… to get ahead.
Turn up the music when I hop right out of bed.
First words… lets get it.

Another day, more money to earn.
I'm in the front; you have to wait your turn.
Not trying to lose because I've been done learned.
That talk is cheaper than some matches to burn.

So I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.

Another day, more money to earn.
I'm in the front; you have to wait your turn.
Not trying to lose because I've been done learned.
That talk is cheaper than some matches to burn.

So I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.
I rise, then grind.
