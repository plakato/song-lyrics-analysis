Answering Bell Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Did I slip? I know I stumbled.
Did I trip? Cause I know I fell.
All's I know is I'll wake up here in my clothes tomorrow.
But oh girl, I wish I knew you well.
But oh girl, I wish I knew you well.
But I'm just saying hi to your answering bell.

Did I run? I thought I was walking.
Through your inexhaustible gale.
The names are changed but the constellations.
Are still falling.
Oh girl, if you could only tell.
Oh girl, if you could only tell.
But I'm just saying hi.

Let your tears fall and touch my skin.
Then your thunderclouds could rage and wail.
I will collect them all for you in butterfly jars.
And oh girl, I'll build your wishing well.
Oh girl, I'll build your wishing well.
But I'm just saying hi to your answering bell.

Did I sleep? Cause I must have been dreaming.
Did I weep? Cause I cried like hell.
All's I want is your fortress of tears to crumble.

And oh girl, I'd tear them down myself.
And oh girl, the stories they could tell.
But I'm just saying hi.
