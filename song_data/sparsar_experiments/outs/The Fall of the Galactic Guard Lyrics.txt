The Fall of the Galactic Guard Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

Hail undefeated protectors, soldiers unfailing in all.
Guiding image of perfection, such a long distance to fall, and they fall.
Blazing polished armour is fading.
Glory turned to spoiled reputation.

Butchers, like voracious creatures sweeping the land.
Corrupted by the thirst to overcome all.

Long ago they protected us all.
Now that's gone, just a world full of murderers.

Fear, pain, rage, sheer embodiment.
Slight, shame, fail, such a disrespect.
Kill, hate, maim, see this cowardice on display.

We used to welcome their arrival.
They served a justice that no other could provide.
Now with the days of truth behind them.
What have they done, what have they stood for?

Hush, they approach.
No sound, at night, They come in numbers.
Be you small child, Or worthy foe, they care not.

They have not come here to save us, run.
Take the chance and run.
Treacherous perpetrators, cons.
Detestable cons.
Overlooked and betrayed our trust.
Betrayed our trust.
Terrorize in the name of force.
In the name of force.

Demons in disguise, deceivers.
Masked as messiahs, misleaders.
Corporeal curse, cozeners.
Bound and bent upon believers.

So low.
Doomed and firm on believing a truth.
That never was.
That never will be.

Watch them gather in their masses to march.
On against the forces of the dark.
Yet, we know not what we hope for or thought.
Is the man an evil or a god?
