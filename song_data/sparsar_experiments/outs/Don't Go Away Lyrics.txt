Don't Go Away Lyrics
by The Runaways.


I met you last nite, it was really alright.
We got along.
We partied awhile, you gave me the smile.
Nothin' went wrong.
Hold me close, hold me really tight.
Go ahead, make me feel alright.

Don't go away, I'm so happy.
You're just what I need to make it.
Don't go away, I'm so happy.
You're just what I need ooooh!

The very next day, you saw us play.
It was really a kick.
Drippin' in sweat, I got very wet, honey.
You did the trick.
Hold me close, hold me really tight.
Go ahead, make me feel alright.

Don't go away, I'm so happy.
You're just what I need to make it.
Don't go away, I'm so happy.
You're just what I need ooooh!

I stayed the nite, it was really alright.
I need our heat.
I got kinda cold, you got really bold.
Ya said, Come to me..
Hold me close, hold me really tight.
Go ahead, make me feel alright.

Don't go away, I'm so happy.
You're just what I need to make it.
Don't go away, I'm so happy.
You're just what I need ooooh!
