Crowns Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

It's getting dark.
In the end of the night.
I can feel your warm.
Come up close.
Close to me.
Cause in the end of the night.
I can feel your breathe.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be alive.
In the end of the night.
You're in my arms.
I'm on my bed.
My bed is.
But in the end of the night.
We rest our bones.
So don't you worry.
Just rest your head.
Cause in the end of the night.
We'll be together again.
You don't need to worry.
I'll make your bed.
And in the end of the night.
I will hold your hand.
So come close.
Close to me.
And I'll come closer to you.
Cause in the end of the night.
When all we have.
Yes in the end of the night.
When I can be with you.
It's getting dark.
In the end of the night.
