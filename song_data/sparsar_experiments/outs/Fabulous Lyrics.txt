Fabulous Lyrics
by Ryan.

Its out with the old and in with the new.
Goodbye clouds of Gray, hello skies of blue.
A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa.
Endless days in my chaise.
The whole world according to moi.
Excuse Me Thank You.
Iced tea imported from England.
Lifeguards imported from Spain.
Towels imported from Turkey.
Turkey imported from Maine.

We're gonna relax and renew.

You, go, do!

I want fabulous.
That is my simple request.
All things fabulous.
Bigger and better and best.
I need something inspiring to help me get along.
I need a little fabulous is that so wrong?

Fetch me my jimmy choo flip flops.
Where is my pink prada tote?
I need my tiffany hair band.
And then I can go for a float.

A summer like never before.

I want more!

She wants fabulous.
That is her simple request.
All things fabulous.
Bigger and better and best.
She needs something inspiring to help her get along.
She needs a little fabulous is that so wrong?

Fabulous pool, fabulous splash.
Fabulous parties even fabulous trash.
Fabulous fashion, fabulous bling.
She's got to have fabulous everything.

Nothing to Discuss.
Everything's got to be perfect.

For me.

She wants fabulous.
That is her simple request.
All things fabulous.
Bigger and better and best.
She needs something inspiring to help her get along.
She needs a little fabulous is that so wrong?

This won't do, that's a bore.
That's insulting, I need more!
I need, I need.
I need, I need.
I need, I need.

I Need FABULOUS!

Fabulous Hair, fabulous style.
Fabulous eyes and that fabulous smile.

I like what I see.
I like it a lot.

Is this absolutely fabulous?

Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous?

Absolutely, not!
