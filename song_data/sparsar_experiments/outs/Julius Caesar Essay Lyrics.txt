by Ryan Anthony G..

Shakespeare portrays Brutus's character and personality by his motives for.
making the choices he made and his personal political beliefs.
Motives:Shakespeare portrays Brutus's by his motives for making the choices he.
made. Brutus said We shall be called pursers, not murders. Basically Brutus.
wanted to make it seem that he had to kill Caesar. But at the same time he.
didn't want a bad name for himself after killing Caesar. this shall make our.
purpose necessary and not envious is what Brutus said. Again in this quote he.
wanted to make it necessary. Summing all this up at the end he wanted to make.
it necessary.
Personal Political Beliefs: Shakespeare portrays Brutus's character and.
personality and his political beliefs. But, Alas, Caesar must bleed for it is.
what Brutus said. They're saying he has to die for what he did. This is what.
they called consequences for what he did. Let's carve him as a dish fit for.
the gods, not hew him as a carcass fir for hounds Brutus said. Assassinate.
Caesar in a way fit for the gods. They don't want to sacrifice Caesar as a.
dish for hounds but for the gods. It's believed that Caesar was for only a.
sacrifice with the gods.To sum it all up Brutus was a backstabber in some sort.
of way he wanted the death to be necessary. He also wanted it to be a gift or.
dish to the gods and he did not want a bad name after his death.
