TAXES [We Going Up] Lyrics
by Xplicit Entertainment.


Yeah.
Yo.
Yeah.
Gas price going up.
Food price going up.
The taxes going up.
Everything just going up.
The hands them going up.
The drinks them going up.
We still blowing up.
And everybody still turning up.

We going up!
We're headed straight to the top.
We going up!
Like drinks filling my cup.
We going up!
You know we never gon' stop.
We going up!
We going up!
Like what, like what?

These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
Like what, like what?

Like you's a small man in form 1, they're taxing you.
Give me cash, I ain't asking you.
Or collect a few tap in your ****.
Things rel hard boy.
Uncle Ellis living better than men.
Somebody vomit again and again.
That is a reason for buying a Benz?

It's a scene.
Things salty like Akeem.
They go charge your ass a grand.
Ask them now if, Yuh wa speed?
People sharing all the memes.
Nothing's funny about the cream.
So that's why I'm living mine.
While you're selling all them dreams.

Spending too much, you should calm yourself.
Prices, they're higher than helium.
You're coming up short like you was an elf?
Switch to super from premium.
Need some cash flow mediums.
Cause I'm on green, lik mealybugs.
Fire for you like Marlene inno.
Really bruh.

We going up!
We're headed straight to the top.
We going up!
Like drinks filling my cup.
We going up!
You know we never gon' stop.
We going up!
We going up!
Like what, like what?

These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
Like what, like what?

Budget pass, mad scene.
Cause everyday I spend mad cream.
Hustle hard, new schemes.
Still I'm following my dreams.
Rel pain to check girls in South.
Take a loan just to take she out.
Gas prices, they're on fleek.
It's two blue notes to fill my jeep.

Used to buy clothes on Amazon.
Now they have me looking like vagabonds.
Used to get laid now I'm laid off.
And it's real bills I can't pay off.
No more sushi, it's level souse.
Can't save, I can't buy a house.
Can't take no trip, I can't buy no land.
No more A/C, it's just rel fan.

Before I wanted a beemer.
Now I got a new Tiida.
Like Fingal.
I get real girls.
They can't fight me down like Thema.

It's carpool when we hit the club.
No more champagne it's level rum.
The government says the party done.
But we're still champions.

We going up!
We're headed straight to the top.
We going up!
Like drinks filling my cup.
We going up!
You know we never gon' stop.
We going up!
We going up!
Like what, like what?

These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
We going up!
These taxes, these taxes.
These taxes taxes taxes.
Like what, like what?

Whoa.
These taxes, these taxes.
Oh no.
Taxes taxes taxes taxes taxes.
Whoa.
These taxes, these taxes.
Oh no.
Taxes taxes taxes taxes taxes.
Whoa.
