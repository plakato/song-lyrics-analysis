Chris R Lyrics
by Swirlies.

In her desk.

Beneath her chair.

We found clumps of hair.

Here and there.

Out in the hall chris stumbled and fell.

I slipped back inside my wall.

To hide behind the walls.

It goes on for miles through empty rooms.

He slowly smiles.

But late at night when you're alone.

Hands first through the cracks.

Then come the feet to your bed.

To lick where you bled.

On your scraped knee scraped just for me.

Behind the walls it goes on for miles.

Through empty rooms he slowly smiles.
