Bath City Nights Lyrics
by Russ Moshavi Chara.

Hey girl I wanted to let you know.
The things between you and me i decided to let go.
My troubles are behind me and my future's looking bright.
The sun also rises and its rays they part the night.
You walkin round Clinton with your hair inside a bun.
It's all golden colored right below the summer sun.
The things get better ain't it going good today?
I hope troubles are over and they're out of the way.

I forgive all of you for sometimes being wrong.
I forgive Dominic too, or i'd never write this song.
I forgive Eric, Joe and Derrick.
Matthew and Aaron.

Forgiveness is what i be thinkin, here's where it begin.

I do not miss my old school at all.
Nor will i ever.
I yet wish the year there could have lasted forever.
But time and time comes to an end.
I wish i let you knew.
That every day that passes i'm still thinking about you.

6th grade days.
Bath city nights.
6th grade friendships.
6th grade fights.
Broken teeth, mended hearts and in-between.
I wish I wasn't such a jerk, or so obscene.

I wore my hair long in the past and now it's short.
I never thought i would make it this far, i guess it worked.
Now i be looking back, visited clemens yesterday.
I'm the king of bath city, get the hell outta my way.

6th grade days.
Bath city nights.
6th grade friendships.
6th grade fights.
Broken teeth, mended hearts and in-between.
I wish I wasn't such a jerk, or so obscene.
6th grade days.
Bath city nights.
6th grade friendships.
6th grade fights.
Broken teeth, mended hearts and in-between.
I wish I wasn't such a jerk, or so obscene.

I'm judaic, arabic and romantic.
I wheel all your moms, leaving all your dads frantic.
I could destroy your heart if i winked at you just right.
And i could kill all you boys off with a whisper to your wife.

Me, Zane and Frankie be testaments.
To what the ghetto life has done and where it has been.
NYC, Roseville it don't matter.
You girls better run before my love grenade scatter.

Casenova, if i wanted to i could.
It's just i got high standards.
Lower em? I never could.
I might be an ex-ghetto rat but you know i got class.
I ain't like some people who gotta be so damn crass.

I got style, swag and i got swing.
I got everything you want and i don't cost a thing.
My calling card is some charm, and a love potion too.
I might be perservering but I'm victorious too.

6th grade days.
Bath city nights.
6th grade friendships.
6th grade fights.
Broken teeth, mended hearts and in-between.
I wish I wasn't such a jerk, or so obscene.
6th grade days.
Bath city nights.
6th grade friendships.
6th grade fights.
Broken teeth, mended hearts and in-between.
I wish I wasn't such a jerk, or so obscene.

Bath city king, watch me flash my blind.
Ima be fuckin with you as i go on my damn fling.

Bath city days, batch city nights.
Bath city ways, bath city blight.

Bath city.
Bath city.
Bath city.

Yo this is Mosh Arab, comin' to you straight from my new place, the township.
I be goin' to Mt. Clemens this summer.
I can take a few people but I need you to feature with me in a rap.
