Breaks In Paris Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Think better.
Think twice.
Follow your heart.
Come out tonight.

And if I'm stupid.
Well then you know, I was wrong to let you go.

Peering through the glass I see what it could have been in two years time.
What's a little distance in between.
But then she said breaks in Paris weren't the reason why.
Weren't the reason why.

Think better.
Think twice.
I know you love me.
Somewhere inside.

And if you didn't, then would you cry.
Lonely is the night.

Peering through the glass I see what it could have been in two years time.
What's a little distance in between.
But then she said breaks in Paris weren't the reason why.
Weren't the reason why.

Peering through the glass I see what it could have been in two years time.
What's a little distance in between.
But then she said breaks in Paris weren't the reason why.

Breaks in Paris.
Breaks in Paris.
