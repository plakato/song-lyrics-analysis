60 FPS Lyrics
by Swift.

Hopeless I'll stay always the coward..constantly weigh all the things you.
say..never enough, but I'd prove every hour. making a case just to see your.
face.

I'm alright... but this air is getting tough to breath...It's okay...we're.
alive...not the way that I'd hoped we be.

Let's clear the floor and dance it away like we did before and stop all this.
running in place.

Nervous each day..my heartbeat won't act right, and here I hang by the things.
you say...pray that we stay like gardens and daylight. no matter how long by.
the phone I wait.

I'm alright... but this air is getting tough to breath...it's okay...we're.
alive...not the way that i'd hoped we be.

Let's clear the floor and dance it away like we did before and stop all this.
running in place.

You know that I'll never ask you to go away.

It's undebatable...this is the hard way.

Let's clear the floor and dance it away like we did before and stop all this.
running in place.
