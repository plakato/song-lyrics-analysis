His Loyal Love Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

She into me.
See into me.
Soaring over my heart.
She for the keeping.
Of each passing day.
I pray.
Of each passing day.
I pray.
She among the precious ones.
Far enough and distance between.
My eyes no longer young.
I see no star.
I see no star.
Brighter than the sun.
Bride and spirit say come.
Bride and spirit say come.
