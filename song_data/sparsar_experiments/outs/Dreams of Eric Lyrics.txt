Dreams of Eric Lyrics
by Yung Neptune (AKA YUNG JZ7).

Registered arsonist.
Carvin up the parthenon.
Of beats while he weeps.
The she sheep covered in skeet.

Crackin famous jokes.
While the actor's-daughter spoke.
Choke the yoke joke and blew.
A toke/oz.

She didn't come with.
Cuz the tire exploded.
Or if it did she.
Hit the road with her head.
At least I was told this.

Heartbroke but my chode.
Did erode another girl's.
Gullet throats.
Did explodeddd.
