Cranberry Juice Lyrics
by SwaVay.


Girl I been scoping you.
And you been scoping me.
I tryna' see 'bout you.
I hope you come and see.
Girl you fine.
With a new mind.
A perfect 10.
Like my shoe size.
You DOLO.
And yo crew fine.
Quit playin round.
And be mine.
You got the hoes.
And them guys so foo foo.
Them other girls.
They fine too.
But they can't do it like you do.
Hypmatized like voodoo.
You shot me down.
And it's only fair if I shoot you back.
So Ima shoot you.
Come in camera let me shoot you.
&amp; play in ya hair.
I know you wanna go around the world.
I'll can take you there.
Sneak and see your underwear.
PDA like who gon care.
Kissing for the public.
Baby let me touch it.
We so lovey dovey.
Especially when we...
Now you my cuddle buddy.
Now can I kiss your lips.
Your hands around my neck.
My hands around yo hips.
I'm drinking on a 'Zona.
And you can take a sip.
And falling on this trip.
Long as I got my DOLO chick.

She so fine.
My DOLO chick.
She so mine.
My DOLO chick.
She so la.
My DOLO chick.
She so raw.
My DOLO chick.
You can't hold my DOLO chick.
She my own and DOLO chick.
You can't hold my DOLO chick.
No.
You can't hold my DOLO Chick.

Girl it just warm out.
Got so much love for you.
That I would buy a dozen or two.
Of flowers until they sold out.
And then run to the next store.
Fighting the summer.
And skating around something like it's roll bounce.
And I don't smoke.
But you're my high.
So baby I.
Would kind of like it if we chilled and maybe smoked out.
Write your name on my own cloud.
And this is real love no doubt.
And we can chill by my old house.
In the park or maybe your house.
Can I kiss by your mouth.
Let me see what you're about.
All them other numbers throw em out.
And come cuddle like a little kid running to his mom when he hear and sees a.
storms out.
And hibernate until it's warm out.
And girl I'm sorry if I'm boring now.
I just can't stop saying i love you over and over.
So baby don't make it over.
See i'm maturing now.
I bet I text you right back tho.
I Finally got a girlfriend who understands.
Now I don't know how to act tho.
So I hope you can back stroke.
Cause I'm swimming in your love.
And we Skype every night on my Mac tho.
And I know that I'm attracted tho.
Can now we talking tatts tho.
Like ones that match tho.
And she even like my hair.
And I don't even gotta wear another bro.
If not love.
Then what's that bro.
And she gotta history.
But i ain't worried about that tho.
And she love to call me daddy.
And she even gotta fatty.
But you know that you gotta look back tho.
But don't look too long.
Cause you might mess around &amp; just have to get smacked tho.
Cause you know I got her back tho?
Right?
Right?

And we fuss and fight like every night.
But.
You know I got her back tho.

Right.
