Webslinger Lyrics
by 4th Pyramid.


Webslinger.
I'm off the top, dead ringer.
Teleport to spots with shots of red stingers.
Block is hella hot.
Get left with bent fingers.
Alleys by the lock they robbed the set lingers.
My sixth sense kicked in reveals Timbs by the steel fence.
Some kids are real dense.
Leap a single bound that's the way I go.
Leak a single sound to the way I flow.
Break the globe.
Tittyscapes paint the mold.
Tales are told.
Woody snakes take your gold.
Crimson sky.
Young bloods live and die.
Man alive, conflict.
Him and I, plans collide.
Overthrow lands that slide.
I handle mine.
Born with the hands of time.
Landfill mine.
Made the devil dance in line.
Damn if I'm....

Cause I'm a webslinger.
Going line fore line.
Cause I'm a webslinger.
Going line fore line.
C'mon.
C'Mon.

Live from the booth, get high on the roof.
Sm'body swinging, scifi on your stopp.
I'mma die fly.
Glide by something new.

Refine another view.
Around crying mans.
And slime in the zoo learn to shine.
Grind in define what is true like harley on the beat.
Speeding thoughts on the mic like the marley by the beach of course.
Got the oceans and trees I don't need to floss.
Got to take the airplane too many streets to cross.
Meet the boss.
Who allowed the keys to toss.
Beat the odds.
Rose form the beneath the frost.
We heat to.
Impeach the loss.
Beach from Jaws.
Busta rocket launcher'll reach the stars.
Beast on bars.
Came through the feast y'all.
Peace to god.
Rise to the east I call.
