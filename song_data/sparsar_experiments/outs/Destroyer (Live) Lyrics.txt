Destroyer (Live) Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

He spent his life a silent sentinel for all to fear.
He walks, he talks, he thinks, he feels but no dare go near.
He takes in all he sees, nothing escapes his gaze.
And when he strikes, he strikes for right, a glorious sight.
Destroyer, destroyer.
Destroyer, he's in town.
He came to be from a grand mistake, a mystical charade.
Created to decide the good and bring repercussive aid.
As awareness filled his fame and he examined those who leered.
And he cleaved the air with his fiery stare rend all those there.
Destroyer, destroyer.
Destroyer, he's in town.
A day will come you'll be drawn into the center of your town.
And come upon a mass of steel that cracks the very ground.
Prepare to meet your judge, don't think to run away.
Just pray your face holds no disgrace for the deadly ace.
Destroyer, destroyer.
Destroyer, he's in.
Destroyer, destroyer.
Destroyer, he's in town.
Oh, he's in town.
You'd better stay out of his fucking way.
He's gonna kick your ass.
Yeah, destroyer.
