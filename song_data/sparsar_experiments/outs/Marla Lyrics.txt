Marla Lyrics
by Univore.

I was such a fool for thinking I was king of the school.
I was struck around hearing I was talk of the town.
But I was so mistaken.
I was so mistaken.
I was wrong.

Marla.
Marla.

A diamond in your hand is something that you must understand.
I could have grown old sipping from an ocean of gold.
But I was so mistaken.
I was so mistaken.
I was wrong.

Marla.
Marla.

Marla.
Marla.

Walking through the park I see a man is holding your heart.
Happy as a clam, he couldn't really care who I am.
Cause I was so mistaken.
I was so mistaken.
I was wrong.

Marla.
Marla.
