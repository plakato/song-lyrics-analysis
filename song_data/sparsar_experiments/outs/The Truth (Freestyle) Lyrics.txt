The Truth (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Yung F.L.Y.


*Jayso mimics the sample* 
They call me Jayso 
Be, like Yung Fly Ebe like we made Tasha, Proud, 
Ugh, Yeah, 
YÎµ, ma rap music, Akwaaba 
 
I just dropped a bomb. You lighting stoves 
Let your lines out. While I explode 
My steeze mad heavy, like Iron chains, 
I heard the truth. Hurts. I'm in pain, 
Skills, legit, no federal issues, 
Just did a hit. You committed a miscue 
Skillions folk, just went official 
I heard your clique's broke. Let me fix you, 
It ain't. Nothing to me delivering new beats 
Chilling on cloud. Nine haters wan push me 
I'm too busy to look change coming in 
Counting papers, greens, I'm turning a new leaf. 
Your lyrics is too weak. Mine'S Goliath 
Call me RL Stein, a ghost writer 
Flow rider like surfers 
Bring. The Fire Service 
When, I speak to the beat ya, heard this 
Money ain't. A thing 
My wealth is in Heaven so said the Reverend 
The Oldest Lesson.
