Certified Lyrics
by 702.

Here we go again, you're about to cry.
I'm about to listen to another niggas lie.
Everytime you call, you want good advice.
And everytime you ask I tell you everythings all right.
First you let it go, then gave him one more chance.
This time number makes number three, it's a different circumstance.
Women on the side, babies mamas too.
This time I can't hold back I think he's running game on you.

If you don't know where your man is.
And he left you home with both of your kids.
Girl yo mans a ho, a playa, certified ho.
If he can't call home to explain.
And all a sudden everything has change.
Girl your mans ho, a playa, certified ho.

You say your man gets off from work at nine.
So why he turn his cell phone off til one clock at night.
I'm trying to tell you like a friend, that if you think smell fish.
You do girl friend, he's been cheating on you.
Don't take a blind man to see.
That your just holding on for what you wish that this could be.
But see, every mans got his own set of rules.
Lines that he won't cross if he's being true to you.

If you don't know where your man is.
And he left you home with both of your kids.
Girl yo mans a ho, a playa, certified ho.
If he can't call home to explain.
And all a sudden everything has change.
Girl your mans ho, a playa, certified ho.

I don't want to come across.
Like I'm coming down on all of my playas.
But if you got a family waiting at home.
You should be there, you should there.
This goes out to all of my ladies and the fellas.
Waiting for someone they love to come home.
If their not there and they should be there.
Then it's certified, he's a certified ho.

If you don't know where your man is.
And he left you home with both of your kids.
Girl yo mans a ho, a playa, certified ho.
If he can't call home to explain.
And all a sudden everything has change.
Girl your mans ho, a playa, certified ho.
