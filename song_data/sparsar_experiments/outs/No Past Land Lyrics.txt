No Past Land Lyrics
by Russian Red.

If my hands weren't there, like I saw in the stream.
Of the drawings been made on a full colour screen.
If they weren't to be found, then what else could I be?

If your hands weren't there, like I saw in my dreams.
&amp; the poets we made, had all gone, disappeared.
Then what else, then what else could I be?

If your hands &amp; my hands strolled together around.
If they were to make friends we'd be possibly up.
To escape from this world, from this no past land.
If I looked in the windows while walking pass through.
If I stared at the willows with my seven black truths.
If my eyes were to see what belongs to your mindâ€¦

If you'd like, keep perceiving what lies on my back.
And your eyes will shine through the glass of my wine.
And the windows, the willows, the pillows, and your mouth.

If your hands &amp; my hands strolled together around.
If they were to make friends we'd be possibly up.
To escape from this world, from this no past land.
