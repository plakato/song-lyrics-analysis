Cowgirl Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Give me 4 wheels made in the USA.
An old dog riding shot gun.
I'll take burger and fries with a cold beer.
After a hard days work in the hot sun.
Just a nail to hang my ball cap on.
A front porch to watch the world go by.
Give me a rooster crowing, coffee in the morning.
And when it comes to the rest of my life.

Give me a cowgirl.
With a strong heart.
A soft touch in my arms.
A big love for one man.
That gives all that she can.
Blue jeans and a t-shirt, god fearing, down to earth.
Cowgirl.

I'm into old rock n roll.
Life on a dirt road.
Staying young, and picking this guitar.
I'm rough around the edges.
But I feel at home in a church pew with a pool cue in a bar.
I don't need a big nest egg for a rainy day.
I ain't afraid of getting wet.
Pretty much easy going.
I ain't hard to please.
But when I ride off in the sunset.

Give me a cowgirl.
With a strong heart.
A soft touch in my arms.
A big love for one man.
That gives all that she can.
Blue jeans and a t-shirt, god fearing, down to earth.
Cowgirl.

Give me a cowgirl.
With a strong heart.
A soft touch in my arms.
A big love for one man.
That gives all that she can.
Blue jeans and a t-shirt, love me so much it hurts.
God fearing, down to earth, cowgirl.

Give me a cowgirl.
