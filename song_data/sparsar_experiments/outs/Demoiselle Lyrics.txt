Demoiselle Lyrics
by Antonym.

Demoiselle 
 
Insecurities tangle you up 
Into one big mess, 
Damsel in distress. 
So, you surround yourself by darkness. 
I still don't know where your heart is 
We could find it 
You try to find it 
 
But, even though you're all alone, 
All alone, when I am gone, 
I know you're gon na hear this song 
I'm coming back, say 
 
I'm, coming back, oh 
I said: I'M coming back. 
Let me figure out some things to put myself on track. 
Then. You could help me through the door 
Get my suitcase unpacked. Then we could 
Go slow, 
Go, slow, 
, 
Sara, Laban, 
Summertime sadness. 
I just wanted you to know 
That baby, you, the best 
 
Antonym 
Let me. Ask you one thing girl: could you 
 
Sara Laban 
Kiss me hard before you go 
Summertime sadness, 
 
Antonym, 
With, a With a 
Girl, I'm Anton Bouffard 
Mind is so twisted like the street on Lombard, 
Spit hard bars, you don't even know 
I spit a flow turn. You red, like the Teletubbie Po 
Oh. No, no, who are you 
Demoiselles, like I found two 
Two plus one. That'S simple: math 
I can't pick up the phone when I'm chilling in the bathtub 
 
Don't forget the bubbles ho
