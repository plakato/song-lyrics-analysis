Paint It Red Lyrics
by Two Inch Punch.

I know, you're beautiful baby.
It's no secret.
I know, You're beautiful baby.
But you don't have to paint it red.
But you don't have to paint it red.
Two leaves, two trees.
Blowing by the wind.
Blowing by the wind.
Blown by the wind.
You give me no sleep, no sleep, no sleep.
Its too late, it's too dark to see.
But, I... can feel everything, everything.
Two leaves, two trees.
Blowing by the wind.
Blowing by the wind.
Blown by the wind.
