Tell The World Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

I will not be afraid to tell the world.
About Jesus Christ For it was Him who died.
Shed his blood for me So I could have eternal life.
Because I love him I'll tell everybody.
That he's coming back again Got to share it in the North.
South, East and West On the mountains in the valley.
Everywhere.

I've got to tell the world I've got to say.
Just believe it, then receive it.

When I walk through the valley of death I will.
Have no fear Even when my enemies surround me.
Lord you're always there Surely goodness and.
Mercy will follow me every day of my life Cos.
You're leading me, protecting me Guiding me.
Straight to eternal life.
