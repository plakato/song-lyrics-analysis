I'm Not In Love Lyrics
by Yung Joey.


See, I could tell you something that you already know: 
I don't well shit. We don't love these hoes 
Fuck'em pass'em fuck'em, pass'em 
That's, my homies yeah. We fuck'em pass'em, fuck'em, pass'em, yeah 
Bitch, that's the word around town and bitch. This is dog, eat, dog, world
, 
Bitch, your booty look fat, let a nigga hit it from the back. 
I, say: aye girl. What the fuck is your name cause. I ain't really trying to play
games 
Can when you can't 
Yeah right up out the front 
Bout to blaze. A blunt get up in the car 
See what she want. Hopefully the front 
Let her come through dive into lust, 
Still, no love in god. We trust 
Hand. On the rug hand, in the truck 
Hand is a must send her to the bus 
Yeah it's fucked up, but my heart. She never touched 
Yeah it's fucked up, but on the real, the brain sucked, 
 
I'm, not in love, so don't forget it 
It's. Just a silly phase, I'm going through 
And just because I call you up 
Don't get me wrong, don't think you got it made 
I'm, not in love, 
No, no 
 
Nothing, but sex is on my mind. What'S your name girl you so fine 
 Wan na take you to the W, but I don't really want. No wine and dine 
I'mma keep this shit, always G. Like a MP3 
What. I look like Pay you for the pussy 
What, I'm giving. You is still free. 
No money for calamari, I'm so sorry, dolly 
I can't lie. You got game like Amari, but play me like Atari 
I got big dreams and ambition. You can call me Wale 
If. You think that I'mma kiss your lotus flower bomb, uh uh, that's Wale 
How, the fuck I'mma fall in love with you. When I'm in love with myself 
Bitch, you think I'm cuffing, you bugging wait. Let me get you some help. 
Make sure my presence is felt down in my undergarments 
Courtesy of the walk in closet in my spacious apartment, .
