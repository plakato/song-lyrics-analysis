Bless Me Lyrics
by 6lack.


Tell me tell me tell me.
Tell me what you're looking for.
Is that me, you'll see.
You'll fall in love just from looking at me.
Crystal ball I could tell you what you need to know.
Please believe, You and me.
We on Neptune probably smoking weed.

Grind hard baby break it break it down now.
Put your heart in, make me make me proud of you.
I don't want to have to take ya take ya down now.
Earthquake girl we bout to shake the ground now.
And I've been on the road met a lot of girls but I met the wrong kind.
Was looking for a muse think I found that shit in you it's been a long time.
I thought I'd never change was a slave to the game in the wrong mind.
Was looking for the truth then I found that shit in you I was so blind.
Yeah.

Please hold on to me.
Girl I need your love.
You were sent to me.
From the skies above.
Angel where you been.
Fiending for your touch.
Can you bless me.
Please hold on to me.
Girl I need your love.
You were sent to me.
From the skies above.
Angel where you been.
Fiending for your touch.
Can you bless me.

Tell me tell me tell me.
Tell me where you wanna go.
Let me know, need drugs.
I know a place where we can get it for the low.
Tell me tell me tell me.
Tell me what you wanna do.
Leave earth, for what its worth.
I got these tickets now you're taking off of work.

Grind hard baby break it break it down now.
Put your heart in, make me make me proud of you.
I don't want to have to take ya take ya down now.
Earthquake girl we bout to shake the ground now.
And I've been on the road met a lot of girls but I met the wrong kind.
Was looking for a muse think I found that shit in you it's been a long time.
I thought I'd never change was a slave to the game in the wrong mind.
Was looking for the truth then I found that shit in you I was so blind.
Yeah.

Please hold on to me.
Girl I need your love.
You were sent to me.
From the skies above.
Angel where you've been.
Fiending for your touch.
Can you bless me.
Please hold on to me.
Girl I need your love.
You were sent to me.
From the skies above.
Angel where you've been.
Fiending for your touch.
Can you bless me.

Tell me tell me tell me.
Tell me where you wanna go.
Let me know, Need drugs.
I know a place where we can get it for the low.
Tell me tell me tell me.
Tell me what you wanna do.
Leave earth, for what its worth.
I got these tickets now you're taking off of work.
