No T.S. Eliot Lyrics
by Swordplay.

I'Ve been walking along a tightrope just a tad bit too tight 
Tonight I'ma be off into the shadows. 
Until one day when the bright lights, generously shine down, 
And everything except the background - will fade. 
 
I tip toe trip. I don't dance., Say god, damn pretty, please 
Would you let the man at the grand piano play 
He's been living in a bubble that that that's been walking the line to 
Any point in time that I've ever made 
 
And in the room. The women come and go 
Talk-talk-talk-talking of Michelangelo 
They, talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk too much 
 
Find me where the footsteps don't ever make a sound 
And around time as it unwinds and finally, frays 
Every point in the past has got a date: dot 
That's about to get cropped out. 
By. The big picture before it's about to be outdated, 
Out dating in a state of paralysis, 
And you're content with falling in love with inanimate objects, 
Degenerate subsets under parasitic sunsets, 
And, sexually driven fleshy plastic or a psychopathic babbling 
A classic case of affection without a cause. 
You'Ve got it all: wrong.They lied to you 
And. Then they made you weak and told you what to do 
And. What to think like it's nothing more than that 
You! Don'T know what to say.. You don't know how to act. 
And you'll be gone soon. 
 
And in the room, the women come and go 
Talk-talk-talk-talking of Michelangelo 
They, talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk too much
