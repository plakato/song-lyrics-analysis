After You've Gone Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone, there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue you'll feel sad
You'll miss the bestest pal ya ever had

There'll come a time when you'll regret. It
There'Ll come a time now. Don'T forget it
Oh baby think what you're doin'
My love for you is gon na drive you to ruin
After you've gone after you've gone away

Lorna, Luft, 
After, you've gone and left me cryin'
After, you've gone, there's no denyin'
You're gon na feel blue and
You're gon na feel sad you're gon na Feel bad
And you'll miss and you'll miss
And you'll miss the bestest pal ya ever had

Wainwright and Luft 
There'll come a time now. Don'T forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret, it
Oh baby think what you're doin'
I'm gon na haunt you. So I'm gon na taunt you so
It's gon na drive you to ruin
After you've gone after you've gone away
