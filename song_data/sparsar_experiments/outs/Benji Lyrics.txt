Benji Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.


Wooh Da Kid.
I'm on a different chapter.
You in another book.
Came a long way from your neighborhood crook.
Bounce that ass baby pussy wet and she thick.
And I really mean it when I say she on my dick.
So she on my D.I. so I C her the K.
Real hood bitch picked her up from 'round the way.
Tattoos and pills, I'm a fuck her till she pass out.
Bag full of Benji's, cause we.
fucking in my stash house.

I keep it a Benji.
I keep it a hundred.
I keep it a Benji, nigga I keep it a hundred.
I keep it a Benji.
I keep it a Benji.
I keep it a hundred, nigga I keep it a Benji.
I keep it a hundred.
I keep it a hundred.
I keep it a Benji, nigga I keep it a hundred.
I keep it a Benji.
I keep it a Benji.
I keep it a hundred, nigga I keep it a Benji.

Wooh Da Kid.
Niggas stealing swag I'm like fuck 'em all.
Sacks sacks 5th Ave, I'm like fuck 'em all.
Ball all day no drinking like a damn rutger.
She suck me and my brother, now that's a blood sucker.
All about a Benji, I keep it a hundred.
Hating niggas envy, broke niggas.
dont want it.
Hundred Benji's on your head, 10,000 in hundreds.
Just because he had sticky fingers like onix.

Hey y'all ain't never flex.
I keep this shit on hundred.
My shooters they stand by, my youngins they be gunning.
See if they rob my... then I bust them.
Like what then.
These niggas pussy so fuck them.
These niggas ass, I bust them.
I ride around with that AR.
My.....
Twin towers Siamese.
Five bloods that's five B's.
Five bricks that's five keys.
Five hundreds, get your stacks up.
And I could get your body for 5 beads.
