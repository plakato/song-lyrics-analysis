A Love Like That Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


You've been whispering things I've never heard.
Love's been redefined, it's more than just a word.
I never thought I'd fall again.
But roads divide and new roads begin.
So it could take a lifetime to find someone like you.

I've been looking for a love like that.
Once you start it you can't turn back.
I get the feeling that I'm looking at.
The answer to my prayers.
Cause when you lay me down you set me free.
My heart stops when you touch me.
I've been looking for a love like that.

Each time it felt so right.
It always turned out wrong.
I know it was you, I wanted all along.
I thought it was impossible.
But I think I found my miracle.
I only needed someone who needs me like you do.

I want an earth shaker.
A risk taker.
One hell of a love maker.
Somebody that wants nobody but me.
