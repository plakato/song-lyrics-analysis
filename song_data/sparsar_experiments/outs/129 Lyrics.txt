129 Lyrics
by The Undergods.


*Awaiting transcription* 
 
I've been in this game. For years. It made me an animal 
One millennium. Later, I'm still a cannibal 
Hands free answerable memory, expansible sample you 
Question, you answer you dismantle you 
To examine you in the flight path, a light craft 
If, my rhymes climb height too fast. You might crash 
Tried to get through, though ____ taping Benazir Bhutto. 
The assassin got too close. 
Search party found a body no prints, just nobbies 
Corpse smell, like pastrami. Anybody care to stop me 
The, mic's, out of tune. Tell the sound engineer: 
'bada bing, bada boom' sound check one two 
You. What were you thinking Who? The fuck cares about lyrics 
How. Can this even exist? 
It'S the smiley face attached to the paper. Next to the gun, rack 
Copenhagen did six sets of tracks: 
 
*awaiting, transcription*, 
, 
Cannibalise, the kid spitting, something that is fit for consumption, 
Some, niggas hate it. Some niggas love it the shot which make you stiffen, your
stomach, 
A thousand bars of running. You still tryna spit a hundred 
Too stubborn to see the UnderGods coming 
At Robert Lange Studio, pressing buttons, 
Plugging microphones in and busting Big Punisher, never punches, 
I, don't know how he does it, but he would be proud of it. 
Canibus Keith, Murray UnderGods. We coming
