A Little Bit Lyrics
by A-ha.

And it will take a little bit of extra time.
To make it shine, to make it shine.
And it will take a little bit of extra care.
To bring it where you think it's there.

And there's no one else around.
This is what I've found.

Anyone you see.
Anyone you meet.
Someone at your feet.
Anyone could be that one.
Anyone you know.
Anywhere you go.
Someone at a show.
Could be that one.

And it will take a little bit of all you've got.
To get a shot, to get a shot.
And it will take a little bit of extra care.
To bring it where you think it's there.

And there's nowhere else to go.
This is what I know.

Anyone you see.
Anyone you meet.
Maybe down the street.
Anyone could be that one.
Everywhere you look.
Pages of a book.
All the years it took.
Everything that got you down.

And it will take a little while to get back home.
The road is long, the road is long.
And it will take a little work to get it back.

Anyone you see.
Could be the one.
Anyone you meet.
Could be that one.
Someone at your feet.
Could feel the same.
Maybe you'd complete.
Could share your name.

Anywhere you look.
Pages of a book.
Everything she took.
Never let it keep you down.
You're holding out for news.
All broken up and bruised.
A loser born to lose.
Oh.

Anywhere you go.
Anyone you know.
You think it doesn't show.
But everybody knows.
Anyone you see.
Maybe down the street.
Someone at your feet.
Could be that one.
