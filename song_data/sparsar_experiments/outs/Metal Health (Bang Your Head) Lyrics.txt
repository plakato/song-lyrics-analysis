Metal Health (Bang Your Head) Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Well, I'm an axe grinder.
Piledriver.
Mama says that I never, never mind her.
Got no brains.
I'm insane.
The teacher says that I'm one big pain.

I'm like a laser.
Six-string razor.
I got a mouth like an alligator.
I want it louder.
More power.
I'm gonna rock it.
Til it strikes the hour.

Bang your head.
Metal health will drive you mad.
Bang your head.
Metal health will drive you mad.
All right.

Well, I'm frustrated.
Outdated.
I really want to be overrated.

I'm a finder.
And I'm a keeper.
I'm not a loser.
And I ain't no weeper.

I got the boys.
To make the noise.
Won't ever let up.
Hope it annoys you.

Join the pack.
Fill the crack.
Well, now you're here.
There's no way back.

Bang your head.
Metal health will drive you mad.
Bang your head.
Metal health will drive you mad.

Metal health will cure your crazy.
Metal health will cure your mad.
Metal health is what we all need.
It's like a heart attack.

Bang your head.
Wake the dead.
We're all metal mad.
It's all you have.

So bang your head.
And raise the dead.
Oh yeah.
Metal health.
It drives you mad, mad, mad, mad.

Bang your head.
Metal health will drive you mad.
Bang your head.
Metal health will drive you mad.

Oh, get your straightjackets on tonight.
Oh.
The bad boys are gonna set you right.
Oh, rock ya.
Rock ya, rock ya.

Bang your head.
Metal health will drive you mad.
Bang your head.
