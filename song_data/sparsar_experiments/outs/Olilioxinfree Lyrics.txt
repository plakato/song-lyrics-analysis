Olilioxinfree Lyrics
by Sworn In.


I've begged for death one too many times.
Singing and screaming these useless rhymes.
But this time I'll take control.
I'll lay down and accept my role.

My heart is turning fucking black.
You had your fingers crossed behind your back.
My heart is turning fucking black.

I'm screaming oliolioxenfree.
Cause I can't find my sanity.
Where could it be?
Is this even me? Is this even me?

I'm not suicidal I swear.
Oops I forgot that I don't care.
To appease your standards.
To be the better man.
Withering dry doing everything I can.

I don't get shit back.
And I'm tired of that.
Because everything you hate in me is everything you lack.

Get up.
Get out.

Fuck me till I can think again.
Fuck me till I can feel again.
Fuck me till I can feel.

My world's collapsed.
So it's time to relapse.
Where I shut myself down.
And pull apart the scraps.

So long who you knew.
Cause I changed before you withdrew.
It's true, I'm through, I have no clue who I am.
Just a useless fucking shell of a bitter broken man.

I hate my own head.
I wish I was dead.
I dream of knives and blood dripping red.

This isn't a scene from a silver screen.
And there's no fucking way to wipe myself clean.
The pieces I stole just turned into coal.

Always knew it was my role.
Always knew I was a dead soul.
