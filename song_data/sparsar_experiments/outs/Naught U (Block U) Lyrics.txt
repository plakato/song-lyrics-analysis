Die, bitch, die 
I, told you not to pry in my life. 
Your chance is over. Slut can never be my wife 
So. Why are you tryn' to fuck up my tries to find someone? 
Who'Ll love ME more than my smoochin' style. 
You shouldn't cry- cause you're stupendously, lucky 
To survive. My deadly throws. There'S my pocket knife. 
Our story's ended it's not my fault. You never reply. 
Stop fuckin' with my life 
I'm out of condom supply, 
You heard it right. Bitch, Condom, supply-, 
Blue Daisee's still in business-, Surprise. 
I made some changes to my'Relation Status' 
Now. I know why this problem arises-, I must've forgotten to press'Apply
' 
I've, seen many hoes in my life, but you I admire 
I, told your best friend to tell you'Goodbye' 
Maybe. She knew you were too delicate. 
The result would be disbelief and fuckin' intertwine of the situation
 
Don't know why It's so simple, bitch 
I wanted a girl, but I don't want it now. A'Ight 
You can try your whole life to try and fuck me up. 
But, hey baby girl. It'S not your cup of tea, 
 
You think you, smart girl, you stupid, 
Your, maggot-ass boyfriends, make you look like Cupid 
You! Think you powerful your pinches to the waists. 
Are shit in front of my punches to the breasts. 
You tried hard already- Now go to rest. 
It'S, like I'm droppin' dope, rhymes in front of your daddy 
Who's, a dope smoke ridin' a little bikey 
When. I leave the discohouse, it's nighty, nighty, 
Your dreams of being a CA'll, be fucked, 
Thank, God, Almighty, 
You ain't, a slutty bitch. Your potent mommy got you from a genie
 
I, don't think before I act hate. The Q'what will be.. ?' 
You ain't, no control key-, my Greymatter's mine, Gwen 
I'm, a retiree flirt 
You came on Dey, Hey 
Now. Let me live my life in peace, passion and harmony. Fag 
I didn't propose to her bein' wit'. You cause, I loved you 
Forgot the rules when you forgot there's a thing called me: 
Fuck you 
 
Interlude 
FUCK, ALL THESE MOTHERFUCKIN' BACKSTABBERS FUCK THE AFTERNOONS 
HOW'S IT LIKE BEING ALONE NIKKI, TOLD YOU YOU'D, NEVER WIN 
YOU, JUST FUCKED WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WAKE UP AT 4 
EXPECTIN', THE BITCHIN' SUN AND ALL THEY GET 
IS THE MOTHERFUCKIN' DARKNESS 
YOU THINK THEY SUPPORT YOU 
GET FATTER AND SEE THEIR SUPPORT FOR YOU, 
WE LOVED YOU. Whatever WAY YOU WERE, IT'S ALL PAST 
NOW GET READY TO KISS MY SWEET ASS 
BITCH, GET READY TO FEEL THE WRATH OF THE DAWNING. 
Here COMES SRC, MAN.., 
, 
Sponny's love life is like an ant when compared to mine 
I. Was there since birth till the divorce papers were signed, 
My bitch had a greater tail than his bitch did. 
There was competition in those days- good ol' greed, 
 ) SRC agrees 

Don't wan na stay in a relationship-, a ship, that's sinkin', 
I've been played so many times. It'S time to start. Thinkin' 
What'll happen to these rhymes. If your heart starts meltin' 
Don't curse me before. I get this shit bendin' ho 
These, pinch-fucked motherfuckers! Think it's all a joke! 
But Imma punish'em for badmouthing you 
Ch-ch-choke 
All, you got is some afrotoon maggots\- to suck your dick in afternoons
 
Neha, you a fool-, a lesbian slut who drools on her own panties 
Suck a ballsac you do
li'l for her, but fuck her brains, up, 
Insanity.., 
, 
It's, a Tragedy we broke up, but I ain't mad 
Won't ever fuck up my sister 
Sneha. Please don't be sad: 
Yeah, big bro's bad-, but never has been like this 
Seriously MAD- Mystified And Died. 
I cried for. You lied to many'bout. My status. 
But still survived 
And bribed. All of Nikki's, fagass friends, 
She called me a spy Well
I may as well pretend to be a liar 
Aspire 
Love, my ass. You made believe'til the day in bus line, 
Writing punchlines and payin' police. More fines, 
A meat, mass a.k.a. Angel came to me. 
She'S fine-. Don'T know name no standard, no shit 
But damn She was like the damsel in distress 
Time to become Superman-. She my Lane 
The route I'm'bout to take tomorrow, 
Oh God, Please be mine... 
 
Fuck Nikki-, this new girl's miles better 
I's watchin' 8 MILE. When I started vomit on Em's sweater, 
Started losin' souls\-
couldn't, even chitter-chatter 
Now got my hormones- can fuck on leather 
Now, le'me start doin' what he didn't have the balls to do. 
Blow all of you, 
Ah yeah, bitch- fuck, you too 
Other than your dry cunt. I have other things to chew. 
Talkin' to you. There boobyshakes 
Have, you ever taken out the time to take a look at your legs. 
Gain calls'em, sexy but
believe me. It relieves me of pain, 
When. I say: Hey Ain't, you, my best friend, Nikki 
She, says Yeas sucks. His fuckin' cock 
And comes back to give SpB a blowjob 
Thank, not I'm quite
satisfied. With the service I've got. 
Sharma will fall in front of you when it comes to calling 
Shave your fuckin' pussy, Miss Cumming 
While Sponny is LOL-ing 
Pool-balling on playgrounds-, both black and white 
And playin', with hairs- red black or bruns ) 
, 
Eyo SRC. You did those niggas nice and warm man.. Shit,
