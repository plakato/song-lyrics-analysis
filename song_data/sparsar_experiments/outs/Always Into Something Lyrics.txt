Always Into Something Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


Uh.
Let's do something a lil different.
Uh, uh, uh.
Whoa.
We got a problem.
She's coming.
Whoo.

We got a problem.
She's coming.
Okay.

Uh.

Once again.
I'm sitting here explaining to you.
I'm tired of you.
Acting like a fool.
Show up to my house unannounced.

Tryna figure out what's going on?
Can't you get a clue?
No one is home.

I'm sorry.
You can't be the man that I.
That I need in my life.

No more having to deal with.
All the baggage you come with.
I'll take the time out to say this.
You're just not the one.
So.

Leave.
Get your handcuffs off of me.
I thought you were here to make me happy.
But you ain't doing nothing for me.

I got to tell you something.
I need you to justify.
The reason you wasting my time.
But you were good for nothing.
Always into something.

I'm not gonna sympathize for you.
You never came through.
When I needed you.

Forever had plans without me in.
So I'm gonna take this time.
For my girls and them.

I never thought I'd see the day.
That we'd go on our separate ways.
I can't believe.
I'm sorry you can't be the man that I.
I need in my life.
