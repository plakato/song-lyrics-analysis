They Know Lyrics
by Two Fresh.


That's right they know.
I came from the ? and the shooters.
That's right they know, ?
They see me go, That's right they know.
That's right they know, That's right they know, ?
That's right they know.
That's right they know, That's right they know.

Pussy niggas got a lot to say.
Check out my bank, made a lot today.
Rolling up where I wanna roll.
And I'm getting drunk where I wanna drink.
Real niggas since birth.
You window shopping still think about it.
I pull up and I splurge.
Taking my life.

No seats in my new pack.
Spent it all, made it all back.
Got what most of these niggas lack.
Say it in a song, and it's all fax.
They know I will win.
They mad that I made it.
Can see it in all of their eyes.
That's why I've been reppin' the game.
Got rep in the game 'till the day that I die.

That's right they know.
I came from the ? and the shooters.
That's right they know, ?
They see me go, That's right they know.
That's right they know, That's right they know, ?
That's right they know.
That's right they know, That's right they know.

I would assume that they ?
I'm studdin', I'm spiffy.
I'm puffing this spliff, I go ziggy.
I hop on ? like I'm Diddy.
And shot down and right now I feel like I'm Biggie.

? McGuire and Lizzy.
Then throw her into a tissy.
Talk to my nigga, you feel me?
It's elementary, really.
We're here for a century.
? kill it.
I ain't got the time like a ?
Imma take your wife and ?
?
Imma pass on rappin'.
If these niggas actin'.
?

So ladies and gents.
'till we commence.
With liquor and drugs and the flexing and shit.
We here in and out.
But we know where we've been.
And know that we ain't going back there again.
Let's get the money and let's get ?
Every dollar and cent.
?

That's right they know.
I came from the ? and the shooters.
That's right they know, ?
They see me go, That's right they know.
That's right they know, That's right they know, ?
That's right they know.
That's right they know, That's right they know.
