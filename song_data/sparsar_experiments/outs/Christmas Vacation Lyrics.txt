Christmas Vacation Lyrics
by +44.

You were depressed, you were really messed up.
You know I understand.
But why did you not talk to me.
Why didn't you help me prepare for the nightmare.
You took a vacation into oblivion.
You were so low and I felt like I didn't know you.

Christmas vacation you took a vacation from me.

Once it ended, I mended myself.
But it keeps falling back down off the shelves in my head.
A twinge of pain now, a shudder of disgust.
As I shield my eyes from my own memory.

I knew all about your plans.
I really did understand.
But you didn't let me know.
I wasn't invited to go.
Christmas vacation you took a vacation from me.

I watched in desperation as you stumbled before my eyes.
She needs beer, she doesn't need me, I finally realized.
My anger and pain in all your fun, you couldn't recognize.
I stopped caring long before you started to cry.
