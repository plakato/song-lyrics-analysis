I Love to Watch You Sleep Lyrics
by Union J.


Looking out the window.
Moon is smiling as you're laying next to me.
For the first time I know.
In my soul that I am where I'm meant to be.
Here with you.

It's times like this I know that I have everything I need.
I love to watch you sleep.
Cause I love to see you dream.

And I hope that you are.
Dreaming of me.
And I hope that I am.
The one you see.
And I hope that we can live this dream forever.
Cause where you are is where I'm meant to be.
I love to watch you sleep.
Cause I love to see you dream.

In the silence I can.
Feel you breathing, your heart beating next to mine.
Lost inside this moment.
I just wanna spend each moment of my life.
Here with you.

It's knowing that you're in my world that makes my world complete.
I love to watch you sleep.
Cause I love to see you dream.

Wide awake.
Think about my life before you found me.
Every day.
I wanna wake up with you wrapped around me.

Refrain.
La-da-da-da-da.

I love to watch you sleeping.

Cause I love to see you dream.
