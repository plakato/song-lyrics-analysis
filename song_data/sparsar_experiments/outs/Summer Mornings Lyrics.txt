Summer Mornings Lyrics
by UnknownProductions.

Woke up late summer morning.
Yawning I hopped up took a piss.
Saw a sign on my tv.
And It said look at this.
I put a tape in the VHS.
I drink some water and press play.
Ya know Movies move me.
That's why I watch them all day.
Makes all the bad shit ok.
I fall to my back head on pillow.
Hand on sack feeling the wind blow.
Not from the window but my fan.
So cool like I'm in a swimming pool.
Imma awesome individual.
Oh shit my teeth I forgot to floss them.
It's important cuz my grandparents lost them.

God damn all this is beginning to bore me.
And I'm getting horny it almost four.
So I decide to head to the store.
I grab some money and Head out the door.
I Walk up da stairs and start thinking.
About the sun flares that reminded me.
About the Thermal glares that blinded me.
I squinted and through my eyes I see.
A plane that flys gracefully.
All these cars are racing.
And it is pacing me To get to the store.
To pay my fee that be.
In trade for some more movies.
Hopefully they get get me laughing.
Enjoy summer cuz it's passing.
So I hope you all have a blast then.
