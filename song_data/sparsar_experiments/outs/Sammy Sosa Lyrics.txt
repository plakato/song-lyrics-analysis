Sammy Sosa Lyrics
by Wordsplayed.


I, like my music, like my life, 
Turnt up turned'round, 
I'm lookin' for that wife, 
See, those fiery darts and I duck down 
Hip-hop head on the trill track: 
My T.R.U.C.E. shirt. It'S still black 
I'm still crankin' that C-Lite cause boy. Sin is still wack. 
Yo meet the team they uptown 
Still down to clown. When I come around, 
Rich told the kids to man up or there might a man down 
And yup few things changed since I moved off of that island 
To, the Westside, where they wylin' Mexicans to 
So, throw it up. Four up, 
Too twisted, don't get it twisted! 
That'S in and out in case you missed it 
My don't mean a 
My life. Is His ain't scared to risk it 
Still hate religion. Take me alive, 
I'm, still surprised. He changes, guys 
That's front back and that's side to side. 
Shoulda seen the kid was Slim Shady 
Used to dream of ladies and Mercedes 
80s, baby, hey baby 
Scumbag call me maybe 
Got turnt, that's 180 
Jesus saves Word's bond yo 
See Johnny out was John, though 
Now, I'm runnin', with the truth, like Rondo 
No tag on my Toe 
I'm alive J. Frankenstein 
Dark to light. That'S Michael Jack, 
It ain't, where you from it ain't where you at 
NY blue Yankee cap, 
Christ, crucified. It sound dope, right, 
Black man, red blood, 
They askin', how it's so white 
 
Dark to light! That'S that Sammy Sosa 
Dark to light that's that Sammy Sosa 
Dark to light that's that Sammy Sosa 
Dark to light call that that Sammy Sosa 
, 
I-5 change, lanes, 
Rotten apple, I'm switchin' trains, 
No yellowbone, just black and white 
I'm losin' weight child of the light. 
Child of the corn, my darkest night 
I'm eatin' right, don't hold the toast 
Just bread of life. Let'S hold a toast 
I'm gettin' hype that fruit right, 
My team, ain't, scared of Illuminati 
Clowntown. We gon' ride it 
Jump jump that House of Pain, 
Bass loud goin', wild 
Dark to light dark to light 
Say it twice my Mike Jones, 
I'm mollywhoppin' that micphone 
I put it on. For my time zone 
 said: stick and move 
Ray watch. It'S shown proof 
I'm. Still standin' on 66th 
I used to jock those 22's 
I'm 24, and you better believe me. 
Grace saw that kid through 23 
So, if you prayin' for the weak, say a prayer for me, 
Shouts to my doctor, West coast and my vato 
Still, say a prayer for that thuggish ruggish, 
No, Farrakhan, all the homies love it 
Was dead and gone now. We ride above it 
Beef with the dark, no Klux Klan 
Pac-Man. I caught that Ghost 
Shout outs to them Sammy Sosa
