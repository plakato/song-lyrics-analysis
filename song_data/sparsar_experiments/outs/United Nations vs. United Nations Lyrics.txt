United Nations vs. United Nations Lyrics
by United Nations.

Assailants One through Five.
Are you listening?
Everyone, everything is twisting.
In the path of the storm.
Damaged supermarks on the table.
Were we willing and able.
With intention to harm the UN.

Pattern: sell our plans to the city.
Motion, motion.
Sell our guns to the river.
Drown ourselves in the sea.
Motion. Motion.
Take our guns to the river.
Drown our bombs in the sea.
