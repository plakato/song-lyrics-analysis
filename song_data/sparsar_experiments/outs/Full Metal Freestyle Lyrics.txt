Full Metal Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.

A mastermind, I mastered time.
I put in work, it's overtime.
I'm bout my nickels and my fucking dimes.
Ion't rap because I mastered rhymes.
Pull up on your bitch in my spaceship hella smoking.
Yeah we loc'n and you know we stay lit.
Man I'm posted and she scoping, so I know she want the dick.
Got her open, now she hopin'.
That I take her to the crib.
But I ain't no lame and I got game I could've played for the Hurricanes.
But I'm in the booth, thinking money finna make it rain.
I don't need no fucking chain, all I need is my fucking brain.
S on my chest, I'm hard as steel.
Grippin' woodgrain.
They don't understand.
I'm feeling good, I was born the man.
Bitches on demand, money in my hand.
So I flex on you.
Nike nigga, I put the check on you.
I might spit on you.
Let my fucking pit on you.
Shit on you.
You pitiful.
Who is he? I get rid of you.
You get ridicule.
You miniscule.
I'm andre the giant.
I'm fighting a lion.
I'm king of the Zion.
The lyrical God.
My bars are so hard.
You can't defy it.
You can't deny it, no.
UFO.
You see me flying.
We came to riot.
Niggas dying, babies crying.
Ain't no lying, keep it real.
When you in the field.
Smoking blunts, sipping 40s.
Yeah I'm on chill, ILL.
Yung Simmie!
