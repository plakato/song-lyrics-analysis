Def Jef & Voodu Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway.


Somebody leave me by the name I'm able.
I drop more niggas than a record label.
You couldn't see me if your TV had cable.
I got more juice than an orange and in a minute.
I'm a have it made skill trade, going through crews.
Like a phase I hit harder than the news about a death in family.
I keep kickin my shit as long as my niggas understand me.
Smash ya Grammy watch em try to ban me.
Like they ran me outta town nigga.
You can't stop that sound from the underground.
Let me educate you when you hear it you learn.
In other words I'll impregnate you with my lyrical sperm.
So no matter how far you go away you'll have a piece of me with you, look.

I've never been took or taken bring home the loot.
Forget the bacon you need to change your shampoo.
Cause you be flakin one two watcha wanna do.
If you sneeze before you hit the boom.
I'll tell your god budda bless you.
You don't know nuttin about this hear me out.
The way you wear me out I swear I might as well be an outfit.
Of course I doubt if you can house it.
I sit and see what you come out wit.
Just like I thought, you ain't about shit.
You gettin over with tracks them rhymes is wack.
When you hear me mention R&amp;B, you know I mean Real Black.
Instead of rap, you catchin flack.
Ain't sayin jack I stay in tack cause that.
Run not deaf at budda sack and the congac.
X a contract show me cash no check.
Forget your A&amp;R man and your record exec.
Tryin a flex, if I punched you in the ear you couldn't hear a hit.
They call me Def Jef cause I ain't even tryin ta hear that shit.
I seen a rappers career plummet and learn from it.
Money had it but couldn't hold it he ain't really want it.
I got covered betta than a jim hat shit.
Give me the mic and a gym mat cause I'm about to flip.

Yo, yo, yo, yo.
When I walk the night, looking for something to sacrifice.
My presence is more feared than the Anti-Christ.

My intellect's deeper than moon ditches.
I break a nigga down to his blood type device.
Sliced leaving trails of broken mics.
So what the fuck you wanna do.
When I begin to construct indestructible.
Brands of verbal bombardments, I'm the sergeant.
When my army of words deploy reminds me of the ?law?
Bianca murders destroy all in my lane.
Fom the snows of the Ukraine to the sands of Spain.
I crumple competition crushin they're outta commission.
My shit be switching like sex positions.
No target missin like James Earl Ray.
Booth and Oswald I assassinate blastin.
your eye across the walls  stalled keep it all in your way.
Shootin ya down niggas be screamin that's a Western mayday but.
No ones comin to save yo ass, you stay lost.
Like Amelia Earheart somewhere in the jungle grass.
