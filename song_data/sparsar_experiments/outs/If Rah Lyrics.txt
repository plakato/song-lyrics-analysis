If Rah Lyrics
by Underworld.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Little bit more.
Just a bit more, yeah.
A little bit more voice, yeah.
That's good yeah ok.

The origin of numbers is a questionable hypothesis.
Yeah.
This is the most ancient form of a sign.
This is a more recent sign.
Give me a sign.

Shoes of stars.
Beads of prayer.
Tattooed shoulder.
Speaking, you say.
Fall before you fly.
But I don't look.
And you don't look old enough.
To have suffered so much.
What do I know?
Look, a heart, on your arm.
What does it mean?
I mean, what's that about?

New tattoo wild man I cry.
Its so nice.
Easy up.
Payback.
The hotel.
Free shoes.
“Hey, fly”.
Never one wings is enough.
Unavailable dog, tied to.
Telly, yawns.
Flickers.
Give toys found in a box.
Manhattan swoons.
Tomato paints.
The pirate radio hisses.
Life isn't shit.
Waiting, texting.
Go tell the nation.
Guide to the new.
“Have a good time”.
Crisscross angel.
Honey pot.
Smoldering smoking.
Failed succeeded.
Home and away.
Keep moving.
Beach body blonde.

White van.
Valhalla.
Shimmer.

I don't blame her.
You don't look so good.
You didn't look so normal.
People, struggle, shimmer.
I don't blame her.
You don't look so good.
You didn't look so normal.
People, struggle.

Listening to cars.
Nice clean animation.
Silent message.
“Don't have pain”.
When I wake up.
Wreck.
Drive around the wheel.
Jimmy, Jimmy.
Chicken head.
Rebel.

What's up?
Pop up.
Life just bores me.
There like silent.
Passion die.
18 tons.
One six oh five.
Another guy.

Luna luna luna luna.
Luna luna luna luna.
Luna luna luna luna.
Radiant mirror.
Luna luna luna.
Luna luna.
In love with.

Hello can you hear me?
In a perfect storm.
Luna luna luna luna.
Luna luna luna luna.
Luna luna luna luna.
Illuminate.
Luna luna luna.
Luna luna.
In love with.

You didn't look so normal.
People struggle.
