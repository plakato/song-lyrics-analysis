Adventure Galley Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Addicted to the stormy sea.
The sound of clashing waves.
Proudly they are rushing by.
On their breathless chase.

Hunting for Long Ben and Tew.
To bind them down in chains.
They're standing every raging storm.
The privation and the pain.

They capture every sailing-ship.
They're cashing in by stealth.
Reprisal is the magic word.
To increase their heaped up wealth.

They stand to stormy waters.
The raging wild winds on the sea.
No walking ghost or nightmare.
Could ever force them to their knees.

Adventure Galley.
Proudly she's staying her course.
Adventure Galley.
The magical force, wild and free!

Addicted to the stormy sea.
The sound of clashing waves.
Proudly they are rushing by.
On their breathless chase.

They stand to stormy waters.
The raging wild winds on the sea.
No walking ghost or nightmare.
Could ever force them to their knees.

Adventure Galley.
Proudly she's staying her course.
Adventure Galley.
The magical force, wild and free!
