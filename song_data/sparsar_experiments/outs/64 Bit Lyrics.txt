64 Bit Lyrics
by Swordplay.


I'Ll smoke another cigarette 
And, bang my head on the wall to see how bloody it gets. 
But, the rhythm. It'S like a call to my city, 
I'll smoke. Another cigarette 
And, bang, my head on the wall to see how bloody it gets. 
But, the rhythm. It'S like a call 
 
Aw Fuck it 
You 16-bit, I'm 64-bit 
And. When you done giving me the picture, I'm the one still seeing shit 
Spiraling out in the pixel light and feelin' it 
Who cut the circuit feeding it 
Never cared about. My apathy till you believed in it 
I'm half past serenity. 
The last blast was on my path to divinity 
Went to Sin City with the Sims and sent back that ketamine 
The devil tried to sell us methamphetamines 
And. I almost forgot my Dramamine for the drive home. A head of me: 
 
But, Fuck, it 
You 16-bit, I'm 64-bit 
And. I already passed you four times on this 20 year orbit, 
Wowing out with my boys, now'cos its important 
Wow Owls For sure, then 
And shouts outs to the house that holds my poorest fortune 
It's. Like I'm six years old and trying to torch the porch swing, 
Chopping down cherry trees with an ax 
As fast as the door swing, 
I'm a just go out back and listen to the whores sing. 
You wouldn't get it, though it's a 24 thing, 
The name's Jack Bauer 
I get along with President Palmer and black power. 
I been up for 24 hours dipped out on the nuclear shower 
Now, who got my daughter Kim Bauer 
I want to talk to her motherfucker 
We family 
, 
Aw Fuck it 
You 16 bit, I'm 64-bit 
The desert's, seen a ghost as Mason goes to the cock pit. 
Suicide dive into the rocks then 
The apocalypse pops in 
And helicopters watch. I drop make city blocks, bend 
Bombs pop in a lopsided horizon 
Cyanide inside of my mouth in case of any surprises, 
64 bit and basically four times more clarity. 
Plug me into your system and prepare yourself for disparity,
