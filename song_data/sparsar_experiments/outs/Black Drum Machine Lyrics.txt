Black Drum Machine Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

It is always night for you here.
Your brother was the first boy inside of you.
And as a locust would eat.
Your father was the first man inside of you.

Your body is all your own.
Keep it away from mine.
I love you, Bill.
You forgive everything.

To die and not breathe.
To writhe desolated.
To crawl towards colorlessness.

The grass across the yard.
My father was the second man inside of you.
The sailor is dead, the social worker is dead.
The software engineer is dead, the singer is dead.

You've always lied to us.
Richard Broddigan never stuffed his underwear in your mouth.
I love you, Bill.
I forgive everything.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Let them sing for joy.
But it was you to whom the raven called.

There must be some things.

There must be some things.

Both feet jammed against your heart.
Both feet jammed against your heart.
Do you want me to write your name?
Do you want me to tear it up?
Do you want me to throw it in the garbage?
