Pretty In Green Pt. 1 Lyrics
by Tyler Tracey.


Dancing with a girl wearing all green, she looking pretty.
Grew up in the country but she's known throughout the city.
She dances with other men, I guess we playing that game.
Smiling and eyeing her up because of what she does to my brain.
She don't believe in love but she, she fills me with lust.

At first she was intimidating, never been with a girl like her.
But I got her lit up and she told me Baby, let me burn.
So I let her burn, let her get off at the edge of my lips.
I thought I knew it all but she showing me brand new tricks.
She like it every way, even joins us when I got another lady over.
She kisses me naked while I'm fucking this blonde from behind like Rover.
I remember seeing her in one of Bob Marley's posters.
Now years later I'm laying with her underneath these stars.
If being with this girl is wrong than I'm living a life of sin.
Because I know when I wake up she'll be ready to do it all again.

She's seen the world and everyone knows her.
Seems like every rapper I like fucks with her.
Snoop and Wiz are famous for their relationships with her.
I even remember hearing that MGK was screwing her.
But she's gorgeous, no fortress, so beautifully wrapped.
She keeps my mind going to different worlds of abstract.

People go on the attack but she ain't ever kill anyone and that's a fact.
I ask Baby, don't take it fast, make it last, take it slow.
It's her style to make me smile, make it worthwhile, put on a show.
She makes life better, the sex wetter.
Cost a little cheddar but worth more than leather.
So she can have my paper.
So to the girl looking pretty in green, this is a love letter.
I hope you don't stay outlawed forever, I'd love for us to be openly together.
I'm actually with you right now as I record song.
This may not be my best song but I had to say something.
You know, because I like to get high as fuck.
And I'm out, bitch!
