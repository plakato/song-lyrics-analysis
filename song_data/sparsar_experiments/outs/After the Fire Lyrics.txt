After the Fire Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

After the fire is over.
After the ashes cool.
After the smoke has blown away.
I will be here for you.

After the stillness finds you.
After the winds of change.
All that is good and true between us.
This will remain the same.

Slowly, Slowly.
We turn the page of life.
Growing, Knowing.
It comes at quite a price.

After the fire is over.
After the ashes cool.
After the smoke has blown away.
I will be here for you.

After your time of wandering.
Along this lonely road.
There will be many voices calling.
Mine will say Welcome Home.

Slowly, Slowly.
We turn the page of life.
Growing, Knowing.
It comes at quite a price.

After the fire is over.
After the ashes cool.
After the smoke has blown away.
I will be here for you.

I will be here for you.
