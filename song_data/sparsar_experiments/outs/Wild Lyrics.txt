Wild Lyrics
by XOV.


Held back in chains, losing their way.
Do you know? Do you know what freedom means?
They've got no dreams anymore, nah.

Darling, I'm a free child.
My mama raised me in the wild.
I said, darling, I'm a free child.
My mama raised me in the wild.

This world wants too much from me.
I gave it everything.
It's modern slavery, it's modern slavery.
My brother, he lies to me.
I know 'bout everything.
It's modern slavery, it's modern slavery.

Na na na na na na.
Na na na na na na.
Na na na na na na.

It's such a waste, all this hate.
Do you know? Do you know what happiness is?
It's not in this.
Not at all, na.

Darling, I'm a free child.
My mama raised me in the wild.
I said, darling, I'm a free child.
My mama raised me in the wild.

This world wants too much from me.
I gave it everything.
It's modern slavery, it's modern slavery.
My brother, he lies to me.
I know 'bout everything.
It's modern slavery, it's modern slavery.

Na na na na na na.
What you want from me?
Na na na na na na.
What you want from me?
Na na na na na na.
What you want from me?
Na na na na na na.

Darling, I'm a free child.
My mama raised me in the wild.
I said, darling, I'm a free child.
My mama raised me in the wild.
