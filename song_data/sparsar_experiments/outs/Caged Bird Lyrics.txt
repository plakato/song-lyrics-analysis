Caged Bird Lyrics
by UNKLE.

The wind did blow.
Across the valley.
So we can run.
Under illusion.
This one dream.
I see is true.
The caged bird.
Sings the blues.
For you.
This one dream.
I see is true.
The caged bird.
Sings the blues.
For you.
I know where we can fly.
Into, into thin air.
Something to believe.
Or beware.
Into thin air.
Something to believe.
Or beware.
Into thin air.
Oh I know where we can fly.
Hold on.
Oh someway.
To break the cage.
And route the Rage to love.
Love.
Oh for so many nights.
A prayer to breach.
That star you'll.
Reach tonight.
Into, into thin air.
Something to believe.
Or beware.
Into thin air.
No light despair.
Into thin air.
Something to believe.
Hold on.
It's all a dream.
It seems to.
Feel the air you breathe.
There's so much needing.
We are believing.
Hold on.
