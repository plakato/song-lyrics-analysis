Hectic Lyrics
by Rumor.


Gimmie lights and some cameras and then I'll get to action.
Put me on a record I won't hesitate to smash it.
They're running from the truth, they're tryna get past us.
They can't get no farther, they're kinda like bastards.
Yeah I said that with an asterisk.
I'm well aware it sounded a lil backwards.
Why You so fly? that's what x, y asks.
Sitting in their Cartesian plane tryna catch up.
Let's take it way back to when it was Jurassic.
With all the wild animals trying to attack us.
Do you hear these rappers? talking bout they're hot like.
Something Something degrees, well I'm on my masters.
See what happened to Moses they put'em in a basket.
But he'll later become the leader of the masses.
Every man dies it's ashes to ashes.
They put'em in the ground but heaven is where he crashes.

Last night I was with a couple friends.
And they told me if I really wanted to make a couple grands.
Then I'd have to stop the abrɔfosɛm, follow the trend.
And do the azonto dance.
Changing the game that's what I'm here for.
Tell'em rappers runway like the airport.
Play a beat with a sneer and a weird chord.
Gimmie bass I love my kicks like air Jordan's.
While you there yawning, I'll be here recording.
Very soon I'll be all over the world touring.
I hit the stage and as I appear on it.
I tell the fans to put their hands in the air for me.
Now I'm everywhere a speaker is.
A dreamer but I'm nothing like these sleepy heads.
Shouts out to all the listeners.
I was ushered into the game.
And Now I'm feeling Justin Bieberish.
