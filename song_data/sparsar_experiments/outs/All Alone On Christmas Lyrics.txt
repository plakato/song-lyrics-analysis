All Alone On Christmas Lyrics
by RuPaul.

The cold wind is blowin' and the streets are getting dark.
I'm writing you a letter and I don't know where to start.
The bells will be ringing Saint John the Divine.
I get a little lonely every year around this time.

The music plays all night in Little Italy.
The lights will be going up on old Rockefella's tree.
People window shopping on Fifth Avenue.
All I want for Christmas is you.

I've got to know.
Where do lonely hearts go.
Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas.

Things are different since you've been here last.
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past.
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year.
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared.

Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow.
And dancing all night to Baby, please come home.
Today's celebration is bittersweet.
There's mothers and children in the street.

I've got to know.
Where do lonely hearts go.
Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas.

I'm all grown up but I'm the same you'll see.
I'm writing this letter cause I still believe.
Dear Santa I've been good this year.
Can't you stay a little while with me right here.

I've got to know.
Where do lonely hearts go.
Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas.
