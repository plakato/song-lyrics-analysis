Leave Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

I can't wait forever is all that you said.
Before you stood up.
And you won't disappoint me.
I can do that myself.
But I'm glad that you've come.
Now if you don't mind.

Leave, leave.
And free yourself at the same time.
Leave, leave.
I don't understand, you've already gone.

And I hope you feel better.
Now that it's out.
What took you so long?
And the truth has a habit.
Of falling out of your mouth.
But now that it's come.
If you don't mind.

Leave, leave.
And please yourself at the same time.
Leave, leave.
Let go of my hand.
You said what you came to now.
Leave, leave.
Let go of my hand.
You said what you have to now.
Leave, leave.
Leave, leave.
Let go of my hand.
You said what you have to now.
Leave, leave.
