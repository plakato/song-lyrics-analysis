Unknown (The song) Lyrics
by Unknown.


Let me tell you who the fuck i am.
WTT so let me tell you about the game plan.
With the real plants while i make yo bitch dance.
10 Bands exchange like concentration camps.
Im sick of these niggas talking shit about me not having green.
I got deadly moves like a god damn marine.
Your minds a latrine.
Cause all i hear is bullshit on your rhyme schemes.
Im Hitler in this rap game.
Tyga you a hipster in the rap fame.
Lil Wayne you a pain in my ass mane.
Niki you a bitch get yo ass trained.
Lil B remember im deranged.
Ill shoot you point blank range.
Chop you up and leave you in the terrain.
You niggas don't know pain.
Fuck fame rolling up blunts fatter as a thumb.
Pills that will make you feel numb.
With DJ free styling to a chum.
Wipe off the scum i guess im a beast what have i become?
Im not done yet chill the fuck out.
Mama said you re gonna make it big.
And im out unknown you'll never find it out.
For now lets talk it out.
Haaand time to get blazed out...time to get blazed.

Who is this nigga? WT.
Where he from? Fernley.
What he rep? Unseen.
Man that's crazy you see.

My minds complicated like the name of snuffaluffagus.
Ive had enough of this huff and sniff.
White drugs like ummm white bitches!
Two switches i don't use.
Found out lil b's family was on the news.
Actually i was amused.

Everybody want his yoo hoo.
Just playing hes a smooth dude.
Hold up bring it back than i attack ya.
This is the rapture.
Ill leave you captured.
With a skull fracture.
Compared to me you a cracker.
You dressing backwards.
Androgynous rapper it gives me laughter.
That you say you're getting pussy after.
So don't choke you joke i won't be provoked.
Have some dope have a smoke.
I know you're stoked let me quote.
I hope ill be alright when im broke.
And everything happens for a reason.
People change like the seasons.
Just know smoking weed is frequent.
So if you gotta problem grab a dick and eat it.
OQ already said it before we can't be defeated.
You get deleted trying to match up with us.
You get thrown in the back of the buss haa.
Don't fuss you're just gonna make it harder Hun'.
And if you got a problem.
Here's some roofies and rum.
Have fun hahaha yo yo shits crazy.

Who is this nigga? WT.
Where he from? Fernley.
What he rep? Unseen.
Dam that's crazy I see.

Man most you niggas hating on nothing.
Im WTT cause i wanna be.
Fuck you niggas y'all wanna be's.
Out standing Quality.
Die slow.
