Further Extent Lyrics
by Quarta Quarta.


Spoon feed myself doubt, shadow boxing my conscious hoping that I box him out.
Transmute, a rocket launcher from my mouth.
You don't know what i'm talking 'bout.
Alchemy is so unorthodox, I see my own route.
The orthodontist down the street, can't comprehend the speech.
Friends say that they're my friends, but they think of me the least.
At least, music fills the void, it brings me peace.
Cause personally, a piece of me wonders if i'll peak.
You don't even know the peak until you fall off.
To measure my bearings, I hope that I can fall off.
And when I fall off, i'll climb higher than the top.
And set my foundation deep, within the rock.
Why you rapping like you preaching?
Why you preaching like you flow?
It's a Gem Gang sermon, and think that you should know.
Ya'll be asking where I get my clothes from?
You better ask what the wisdom has become.

They tell me that it's worthless.
But I know that it's worth it.
They tell me that it's worthless.
But I know that it's worth it.

My desire for my passion makes me question my purpose.
What am I doing? Why is it worth it?
Sometimes you have to assess these things late at night.
When the vision is clear, but you can't see the light.
I look into myself for some perseverance.
But why does it feel like I don't have security clearance?
Feel so good, then I just sink.
My dreams stopped making monthly payments to Brinks.
That's life, but not the way it has to be.
I'm taking out the F and replacing it with V.
Before that, I hope to put Positivity.
Make it all present tense, so it's something you can see.
Man it's crazy where we are and how we think.
I'm in a different world when I blink.
My life, something you think you know.
During my biggest show, my dad was getting chemo.
Dropping gems and staying wise.
Gem Gang, do or die.
The smiles that the fans bring.
Gives me a reason to believe.
