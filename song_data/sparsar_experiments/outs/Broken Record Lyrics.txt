Broken Record Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


I've been singing this song for too long.
Just wishin' we we all would move on.
Sick and tired of doing what you want.
You've gone and turned this all into shhh....
It seems a little watered down.
Everybody wanna be a rap artist now.
Tryin' to get the platinum, regardless how.
Hard you played yourself to get fame.

Ain't it a damn shame, music today?
Fad's the same, still you ain't got shit to say.
Expect the kids to pay this expensive fee.
When they can get an MP3 from a friends CD.
Especially when there's less then three tracks ya like.
If it was worth spendin' money then we actually might.
So much crap on the mic, labels ain't actin' right.
Making cash from the hype like The Passion of the Christ.

Just imagine the lights, camera, action, the life.
The cars, the cash, the stars flashin' their ice.
Cock tease R$B pop queens gassin' you up.
Fashion thugs passin' you drugs in the back of the club.
You want a part of it, but is that all an artist is?
A blank mind with a spine made of cartilage?
Hard as it may seem, it pays to stay dreamin'.
Away form the mainstream, just prayin' you'll break even.

Pop Music  4X.

Well, ain't I just a star?

Seated on this bus.
You might recognize me, but keep it on the hush.
You might wanna ask me what I'm doing takin' transit.
Or working at this place.
Makin' your bacon sandwiches.
Kids be acting kinda funny cause they see me.
In a couple little shitty rap videos on TV.
Yeah I got a name, with maybe $2 to it.
Just try and cop a chain making blue collar music.
Truth is ain't much has changes.
Still seems that Kraft Dinner sucks the same.
Tryin' to come up in the game.
With a buck and change.
So touch luck for the other guy and what's his name.
Aim high and shoot far below my goals.
What I expect I'm owed or ever get from shows.
The math never adds up I ain't collecting dough.
So on and on like a Broken Record it goes....
