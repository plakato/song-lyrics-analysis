Battle Axe Exclusive Lyrics
by Swollen Members.

Mad Child.
Star struck, awkward glances, rock phenomenally.
Armed with honesty, Doven wove in tapestry.
Of obscenity, eliminate the enemy.
Watch closely, I'm what you're pretending to be.
We took the turn inpenetrable, and fine tuned it.
Cleared the path, laughed and walked past the wounded.
You shouldn't have assumed we'd take time to breath.
Fuck tricks, I've got alot more weapons up my sleeve.
I'll tell you when I'm finished, I'm armed to armageddon.
Hard headed with the steel ball pulse heart imbedded.
It's hard to believe this is controlled by a brain.
They're retired because I'm wired for sound with iron lanes.
If at first we suceed try again.

Manslaughter in the first, Incidence of red.
Confidence is king, innocence is dead.

Prevail.
Over the course, something like life-endorsed.
I've entered the mother ship, terminated the Denver airport.
Too many guns in the air, you're about to be prepared for.
You've heard us speak, attention should be second nature.
Or maybe you enjoy being severly severed.
By sacred sabres uppin for plegance to break the paranoid.
You're about the dreamscape, we fought with backlash.
Ya'll gonna see my phoenix rise out my black ass.
Tad's cash, a loss of breath.
The only three certain things in this life and death.
Corrosive breath, fermented tissue acid test.
You trying to tell me entertaining is a time exspense.
Any event of contact, to clack.
Draw my herd man, verb back and see what goes black.
Elevated elements, and the knowing guards.
We know the future without the use of the tarot card.
