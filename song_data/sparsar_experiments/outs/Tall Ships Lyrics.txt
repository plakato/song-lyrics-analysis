Tall Ships Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Such a brat.

I knew i was wrong.

Couldn't settle down.

Maybe i'll just take a walk.

Why don't you just shut the fuck up.

Your mouth is closed.

Your mind's made up.

I slipped out.

I went to your door.

The light was out.

You wouldn't talk to me no more.

But when she comes.

It's like a big brass lantern.

Blowing her out.

But like a light.

She likes to burn.
