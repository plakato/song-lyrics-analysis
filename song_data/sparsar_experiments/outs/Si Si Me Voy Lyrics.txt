Si Si Me Voy Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Sí sí me voy, sí sí me voy.
Si se veleti, si se veleti.
Este feliz, este feliz.
And now that I'm here, carry me home.
I'm never alone, carry me here.
And now that am home, carry me here.
A finis a nano la, es mal fuspre.
Sí sí me voy, sí sí me voy.
I'm freer than alley bird, out the cage to see.
Si se veleti, si se veleti.
I've got a alley bird path.
Este feliz, este feliz.
And now that am here, carry me home.
And now that I'm home, carry me here.
Now that am here.
Just to me I feel the car start.
That chick across the bubbling wall.
It must myself in somewhere louder.
My little heels don't feel no pain.
I might just have, and the water has.
But no one had, tried them all.
Sad and I laughed, but I let my heart meet.
And the absence and the close spots, really got to me.
So I called in and I flew in, and they welcomed me.
Hey Johnny, now I've got here, or what else to see.
Oh I can breathe, Oh I can dance.
But I don't have anywhere to rent.
