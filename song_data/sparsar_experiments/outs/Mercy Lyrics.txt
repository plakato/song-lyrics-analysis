Mercy Lyrics
by Awa.

For lack there of I can't define.
Is there another way?
I've had enough, I've paid the price.
To keep the beast at bay.
Feel the undertow of words unspoken.
Hear them lunder from the masses broken.
You have my sympathy.
Now take it away.
Unleash the whores and lock the doors.
Wash it off my skin.
Lets break the glass containing past.
Don't look back again.
Feel the undertow of words unspoken.
Here them lunder from the masses broken.
You have my sympathy.
Come on take it all away.
Come on take it all away now.
Come on take it all away.
Come on take it all away now.
Come on take it all away.
Come on take it all away now.
Come on take it all away.
Come on take it all away now.
Now take it away.
Come on take it away.
Come on take it away.
Take it away.
