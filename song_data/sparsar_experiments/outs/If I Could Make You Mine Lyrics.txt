If I Could Make You Mine Lyrics
by The Union.

Ever stop to wonder who you'd call.
When nothing works an tears start to fall.
I'd do anything to stop you crying.
If I could make you mine.
For just a little glimpse of your smile.
Through broken glass I'd crawl for miles.
I'd be happy as any fool you'l find.
If I could make you mine.
If I could make you mine.
I'd be there for you.
If I could make you mine.
I'd lie for you.
Do it all for you.
The night is still young and naive.
So before you collect your coat and leave.
Let me tell you why's it feel so right.
If I could make you mine.
If I could make you mine.
If I could make you mine.
