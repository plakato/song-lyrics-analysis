Luck Of The Draw Lyrics
by Xazz.


Here I am, I made a fall.
So come and catch me girl.
Before I give out, oh.
I'm riding around, you can let my draw.
The greatest of all.
The greatest of all.

And I know, something inside is telling me no.
One look at you, and you know I wanna go.
Being without you got me feeling lower than low.
I know there's a chore.

It's taking too long to pick up the phone.
So give me a call.
Before it fades out, oh.
We're losing a game that was made for us.
The luck of the draw.
The luck of the draw, oh.

And I know, something inside is telling me no.
One look at you, and you know I wanna go.
Being without you got me feeling lower than low.
I know there's a chore.

Instrumental.

And I know, something inside is telling me no.
One look at you, and you know I wanna go.
Being without you got me feeling lower than low.
I know there's a chore.

Instrumental.
