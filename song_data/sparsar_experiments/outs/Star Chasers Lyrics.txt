Star Chasers Lyrics
by 4hero.

Every find yourself something doing the same thing.
Walking the same old life.
Looking back on yesterday and dreaming the same dreams.
Wishing away the time.

Then you answer your feelings.
And looked deep inside.
You know there's got to be meaning.
Or are we here for the ride?

Caught up.
Here with you.
Trying to make this old thing new.
Caught up.
Trying to chase the stars.

Caught up.
Here with you.
Trying to make this Earth thing groove.
Caught up.
Trying to chase the stars.

Caught up with you.

You find yourself with your heart, not your mind.
Looking up to the sky.
Destination in true understanding.
Escaping the circle of life.

And then you answer your feelings.
And looked deep inside.
You know there's got to be meaning.
Or are we here for the ride?

Caught up.
Here with you.
Trying to make this old thing new.
Caught up.
Trying to chase the stars.

Caught up.
Here with you.
Trying to make this Earth thing groove.
Caught up.
Trying to chase the stars.

So caught up.
Hmm mmm.
Trying to chase.
Trying to chase.

Caught up.
Here with you.
Trying to make this old thing new.
Caught up.
Trying to chase the stars.

Caught up.
Here with you.
Trying to make this Earth thing groove.
Caught up.
Trying to chase the stars.

Trying to chase.
Caught up with you.
