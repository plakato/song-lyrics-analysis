BET Hot 16s 2014 Entry Lyrics
by VI Seconds.

From the moment I was conceived I've stolen the show.
CUB biting my tongue they can't BARE/BEAR what I withhold from the scene.
From my first moment of speech, It was noticed I'd bring all in New York to.
their knees.
Kicks hard enough to shatter bones in my feet.
I hold what you need, this boy is the key.
To my city, scrap all my competitions hopeless indeed.
It's a dog eat dog world, I'm at the home where you sleep.
Giving you nightmares all for the hope of my dreams.
Ion in my back better watch who you eyein' out.
You just another bump in my fabric that Ima iron out.
Some say I'm Wildin out, Nick Cannon ain't employing me.
The strongest weapon in my section so Brooklyn's deploying me.
I ain't here for friendship, I'm here for your respect.
I'll off an Air Force Once for the sake of a Check.
I'm a product of starving, with a bad attitude.
And a man gotta do what a man gotta do.
Pay up.
