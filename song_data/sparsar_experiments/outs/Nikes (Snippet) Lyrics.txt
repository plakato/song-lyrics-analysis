Nikes (Snippet) Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.

Nikes on my feet Janoski's to be exact, riding down the street ask this lady “can I skate that.
?”.
She ask if I could bake that I pull a blunt out, Get her up now then proceed.
to bang that.
Kick it way back with the homies out in Black Water smoke a couple joints.
then get on a song and slaughter.
Talk about killing cops and raping they daughters like I really do that shit.
I'm Charles Manson's father.
You wanna yell at me well you shouldn't even bother, I'm on cloud nine homie.
I can see nirvana.
Nikes on my feet while I smoke some marijuana, you can come jell with me and the homies if you wanna.

All this ganja got me not caring bout no beef, we use to be fronting like a.
stinky female queef.
Fuck it life's short not enough time for that see let's have a good time now.
does anybody got the kief?
Nikes on my feet, Nikes on my feat, What the hell is beef? does anybody got.
the kief?
Nikes on my feet, what the hell is beef? Nikes on my feet, does anybody got.
the kief?
TyNit, Stay up.
