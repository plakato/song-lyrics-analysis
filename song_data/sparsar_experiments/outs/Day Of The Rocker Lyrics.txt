Day Of The Rocker Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

I wanna tell ya 'bout it.
A time is comin'.
Just 'round the corner.
We don't have very long to go.
When we'll be stronger.
Our days will be longer.
It's comin' soon it might be tomorrow.
Can't you feel the power.
It's all around and deep down inside.
Our numbers growin'.
Soon we'll be showin'.
We've got the right to rule.
We won't be denied.
So raise your hands in the air.
And I want you to tell the world all about.

The day of the rock-rock-rock-rocker.
The day of the rock-rock-rock-rocker.
The day of the rock-rock-rock-rocker.

Oh, come on fingers turn me loose.

Ahh, Oh yeah.
Straight from the heart baby.
Oh, come on fingers take it home.
All right take it down boys.

Your time is comin'.
So you be ready.
To show the world to rock 'n' roll.
We'll show them feelin'.
We'll set them reelin'.
They'll know we've got the music in our control.
We'll be in our glory.
We'll stand tall ruling over the land.
We'll live forever.
And then we'll never.
Give up the power once it's in our hands.
So 'til our day has come, baby.
I want you all to raise your battle cry.

The day of the rock-rock-rock-rocker.
The day of the rock-rock-rock-rocker.
The day of the rock-rock-rock-rocker.
Ahhh, ain't nobody gonna stop us now.
Let's go.
Rock-rock-rock-rocker.
Yeah, I want you to move your mouth now.
Rock-rock-rock-rocker.
You gotta shout baby, you gotta scream.
Rock-rock-rock-rocker.

I'll tell you what what I'm singin' man.
I'm singin' the day of the.
Rock-rock-rock-rocker.
Yeah, everybody's gonna be singin' like this.
Rock-rock-rock-rocker.
Hey you in the back.
Whatcha you doin' wackin' off or somethin'.

Come on.
Rock-rock-rock-rocker.
Oh yeah, let it go.
Rock-rock-rock-rocker.
Let it go, go go, go go, go go....
