Unstoppable Lyrics
by Unearth.

Wander this world with tired hands.
Wander these streets a broken man.
Been through this time after time and it won't be the last, but I won't break.
again.
Second lease on a terminal change.
Every step met with force and demands.
Reclaim all that loved and destroyed.
Belief lends a hand to the path of the strong.
I want to know, need to know, my next lesson.
I want to feel whats alive inside of me.
I want to know, need to know, my impression.
I want to look inside and see whats made to be.
I want to know.
Concede the loss of the some to fuel the life of others.
The unstoppable.
Wandered alone, won't break again.
Left forgotten and without hope, I still remain.
Can't stop this heart.
Won't break again.
Forever as stone.
