Xena Lyrics
by Xeezy.

Lying next to her's a Lion,baby I ain't lying.
Actually,I am,god damn,I can't stop smiling.
She's got so much compassion,so of course here comes the passion.
No Mel Gibson,I'm Shay Given,a keeper,my goals everlasting.
I'm striking at yuh midfield baby,can you defend it?
I suck her star,a soccer star,did you get my suck her reference.
Baby you stupendous,write her name in capital letters.
I've seen who's done it worse,so I know,no one can do it better.
Do you comprenda? Plural?! Rural areas on Brenda,tend to be so tender.
Damn this chick she is so special..hmmm.
Pish Posh,biggosh,I'm lost...with GPS,what do you expect?
If she breaks up with me,I'd be her Big Jersey...her double X.
After XXX Vin diesel,please don't gas me up.
I'm a Super-man,that's premium &amp; we're seldom a one of one.
Cause if you lose,then I'm ma lose,then there'd be no more pick &amp; choose.
I wanna be her drill sergeant,so of course she's the one getting screwed.

Late night convo's be,never ending pronto.
She like the way that sound doh.
My lime starts at nine,no Rojon Rondo.
I see my cell ticking.
I guess my ex is green with envy.
See she didn't understand me.
I got a plan A,tell me what your plans B.
I'll change my name to Calvin,if you would be my Hobbies.
I heard a rumor that hoes tells lies,while I was in the lobby.
I'd prolly take a chance,you sweet,top floor,of this I am sure.
X Malcolm,doh I ain't talking Muslim,when I say I'm wanting moor.
Later you'll prolly ask me what that means when you hear it.
&amp; I'd welcome you my child,cause clearly it is apparent.
You thirsty for this Intel,so in shell you be trusting.
No wonder you be so crabby patty,I see you in yo shell that you be hiding.

I'm smiling,&amp; as you alone know this is rare.
Like a Mew Two,or Abra,or Brock getting Nurse Joy inside the bed.
Lemme poke yuh mind instead,lemme stimulate yuh senses.
I'll be around for years to come baby,&amp; I ain't talking census.
