2 A.M. (Whatcha Doin'?) Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.


Ugh 
Now, you can be a cute country girl from Idaho 
That's 23, who ain't never been outside before 
Locked in the basement, without a radio or t.v. 
And still know that if you go to the embassy sweet 
At 2 0 clock in the morning, then the chance is strong. 
15 minutes later for your pants to be gone, 
Fold it up in the recliner right next to ya, shirt, 
Right next to ya bra! That'S right next to ya purse 
Right! Next to the kingsize B-E-D 
You coulda stayed at ya crib to watch B.E.T 
Cuz. If you come to see me at the M.G.M 
And ya faking, then ya, outta here, like MC Em 
Cuz before I sit around and watch you play naieve 
I rather ask you to leave so I could catch some Z's 
And. I ain't trying to be rude. 
I'M. Just busting a flow so that you know before you come through my hotel 
Door that 
 
If, it's 2 0 clock 
And, you don't wan na! Let ya panties drop 
So! I can make that booty hop, 
Then watcha doing in my hotel room, 
I, don't know! What'S on ya, mind 
Well if it ain't that 69 
Back up by the bump and grind 
Then watcha doing in my hotel room, 
 
Enough of that 
Too much shine and recline 
Time to bring the room more thrill than 69 
Whys you in mine, 
If, you ain't, Giving it that's flat: 9 outta, 10 times, 
You only good on yo back 
Contradicted. What you speak. I see the tweak in yo eye 
The type of female, only freaking when she drunk or she high 
Be it. Not. I keep it both that ain't my way to advance 
But when you do beg yaself to get naked and dance 
If you ain't with it. Let me know 
Don't be stopping my stroke. 
Cuz you can leave. I call some more we'll continue to smoke. 
Ain'T, no lac! All my luxury, unless I'm tapping ya lid, 
I bough
