Little Sally Walker Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Little Sally Walker
Sittin' in a saucer
Ride Sally ride
Wipe, your weepin' eyes
Put your hands on your hip
Let, your back bone slip. I want you to

Shake it to the east
Aw. I moved that a baby
Shake it to the west
I moved. I moved that baby
Shake it to the very one
That. You love the best

Little Sally Walker
Tell me what you're gon na do
Little Sally Walker
I'm in love with you

Little Sally Walker
I, see ya sittin' in your saucer
Rise and do the jerk
I love to see you work yeah

Little, Sally Walker
Tell me what you're gon na do
Little Sally Walker
I'm in love with You
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Put your hands on your hips ahh got it
Let your back bone slip
Back bone slip; now

Shake it to the east
Shake shake shake
Shake, shake shake shake it
Shake it to the west
Shake. Shake shake
Shake, shake shake shake it

Shake it to the very one
That. You love the best
Come on now

Little Sally Walker
Shake. It Sally Walker
Shake, shake Sally Walker
Shakin', it Sally Walker

Shakin', it Sally Walker
Shake, shake Sally Walker
Little, Sally Walker
Shake, it Sally Walker

Shake, shake Sally Walker

Shake, shake Sally Walker
