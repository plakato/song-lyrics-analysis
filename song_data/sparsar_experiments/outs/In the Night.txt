In the Night
by Pure Bathing Culture.


No rest or no following before
What's left unknown
In the night in the peaceful, night
Lonely believer. You can't shake the feeling
We. You know that you need it
To heal by revealing

The heat in your fever
Is hot. In the evening
To test, the night

We go so long
Better than go
What's next unknown
In the night. In the peaceful night
Lonely believer no, you seem conceited
We. You know that you need it
To heal by revealing

You test the night
And. You are to shine in the peaceful night
In the night in the peaceful, night
