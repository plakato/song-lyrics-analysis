Minor Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.


God I want to make it.
Put mom up on vacation.
The hottest destination.
Up in the Hottest Nation.
With limited population.
So I plot reservations.
And send out invitations.
But I can only imitate it.
Because we minors, mining for gold.
Trying to reach till we is old.
Hows it going well that's so so.
We dope but moving slow.
Those ones with groovy flows.
Trying to make movies or shows.
But right now on the low.
Well that's poor so.

We only minor but we minors trying to major x4.
Got the taste of greatness and it the sweetest flavor.
But its going to be around so I don't have to savor.
I don't need a girl right now so I'm a have to save her.
Until I make it out she going to have to be a waiter.

I'm a major and minor no Louie attire.
