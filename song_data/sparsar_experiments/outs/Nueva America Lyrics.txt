Nueva America Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

If you lose a finger.
At some point.
Of this terrible fight.
You gotta pick it up.
Clean it good.
You better put it on ice.
And if you lose a leg.
At some point.
Of this terrible war.
You gotta look it up.
Glue it on.
You better start walking fast.
But if you lose your mind.
At some point.
Of this terrible life.
You gotta.
You gotta.
You gotta.
You gotta.
Just fly.
Just fly.
So let me glue your pieces.
I am not new in this business.
Just come with me.
I know how to build.
An exploding machine.
