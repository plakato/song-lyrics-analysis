You Got Me Baby Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

1,2â€¦1,2,3.
She got the money maker, shake ah shaker, radio on.
She say, turn off your phone, lock the door, what's your favorite song.
She take my hand, say I show you things you never saw.
We stay up all night, doing the devil dance till we can't walk.
Then we crawl.
Rock me steady, baby I'm ready she said.

Under the bright city lights, and the neon skies we can.

Let's run run run till the morning comes.
When I'm gone gone gone you'll know.
You got me baby.
New York City put her moves on me shaking my King &amp; Queens.
With a little bit of sweet, little bit of sting, just like a honeybee.
Rock me steady, baby I'm ready she said.

Under the bright city lights, and the neon skies we can.

Let's run run run till the morning comes.
When I'm gone gone gone you'll know.
You got me baby.

We ain't got a thing to lose.
I can't save the world but when I'm with you girl.
There ain't nothing that this boy won't do.
Rock me steady, baby I'm ready she said.

Under the bright city lights, and the neon skies we can.

Let's run run run till the morning comes.
When I'm gone gone gone you'll know.
You got me, You got me.
You got me, You got me baby.
