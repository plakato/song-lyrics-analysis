Girl Like You Lyrics
by Union J.


Well, I'm not the kind of guy you show to your mother.

Cause when I got somebody, I'm looking for another.

I only know how to play it cool.
But you're the exception to the rule.
Cause with lips like that, any guy's gonna suffer.

And it makes me wonder.

What is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
I could show a girl like you how to have a real good time.
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you.
More than in my head tonight.
So, what is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?

Let me show you all the ways that we can get in trouble.

We could go all night, regret it by tomorrow.

I only know how to walk away.
But here with you I just wanna stay.
Cause a single shot of you makes a guy want a double.

And I have to wonder.

What is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
I could show a girl like you how to have a real good time.

Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you.
More than in my head tonight.
So, what is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
