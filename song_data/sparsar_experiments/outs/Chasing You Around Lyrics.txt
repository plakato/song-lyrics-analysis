Chasing You Around Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

If I was a city, in Spain or Italy.
Would you stay here or would you come over?
If I was a whiskey tempting you to drink.
Would you take me down or would you stay sober?

Is it easy to find a love like mine?
To use me up and kick me to the ground.
If your heart could do the talking.
Would it even make a sound?
Do you love me or love me chasing you around?

If I was a sunset that you haven't seen yet.
Would I catch your eye or turn your head?
If I was a secret, could you even keep it?
Could you even stand to hold it in.

Is it easy to find a love like mine?
To use me up and kick me to the ground.
If your heart could do the talking.
Would it even make a sound.
Do you love me or love me chasing you around?

In a hurried conversation on the phone at 2AM.
You said that you'd drop by but you never did.
And with one last broken promise, I finally realize.
I may be yours, but you ain't mine.

Would it even make a sound?
Do you love me or love me chasing you around?
Do you love me or love me chasing you around?
