Yo Girl She Tryna Hang Wit Me She Tryna Hang Wit Me.
Thots Everywhere So You Know She Ain't A Thang To Me.

If You Ain't Gettin Money Then Yous A Lame To Me.

All My Niggas Gettin Money They Make It Rain Wit Me.
Yo Girl She Know Who I Am Yep Im YB.
She Keep Blowin Up My Phone And Im Like Why Me.
You Won't Eva Catch Me Lackin Dont Try Me.
All Da Labels Biddin On A Nigga Tryna Sign Me.

Niggas They Dont Like Me Cuz I Got Money.

That's For Da Opps That Be Claimin That They Wit It.

She Look At Da Money Said Im Arousin.

If You Add A K To Any Of Them It'll Get You Killed.
My Niggas Realla Than Da Realist And We In Da Field.
Y'all Niggas Claim Y'all Gettin Money But Got Lil Bills.

Thots Say I'm Too Cold That's Why They Wanna Try Me.
All Around My Town Everybody Know Who I Be.

Niggas Be Too Fake Claiming That They In The Field.
I'm Be In The Booth For Da Squad Imma Get A Deal.
We Be Rappin But My Niggas Is Down To Kill.
I Gotta Chop Catch A Opp &amp; He Gettin Drilled.
