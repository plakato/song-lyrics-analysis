Fallen From The Sky Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

You must have fallen from the sky.
You must have shattered on the wrong way.
You brought so many to the light.
And now you're by yourself.

There comes a point in every fight.
Where giving up seems like the only way.
When everyone has said goodbye.
And now you're on your own.

If you need somewhere to fall apart.
Somewhere to fall apart.

When the rules of Cain, the rights you made.
The hours did crawl for those to blame.
The broken glass, the fool that asked.
The moving arrow to stop.

You must have fallen from the sky.
You must have come here in the pouring rain.
You took so many through the light.
And now you're on your own.

If you need somewhere to fall apart.
Somewhere to fall apart.

Well the ruins of man, the bloody rag.
Neither fool the bull, the powdered hag.
The nights they make the rattle rag.
The wolves that follow the outed man.
The falling star, the way we are, divine.
The rules that never ever multiply.

You must have fallen from the sky.
You must have come here on the wrong way.
You came among us every time.
But now you're on your own.

If you need somewhere to fall apart.
Somewhere to fall apart.

Well, they call you saint, the basket case.
The rules of thumb you have to break.
The raging skull, the rag to the bull.
The nails that drag in either hand.
Well, I will make my work of that.
I know this place, I know this task.

You must have fallen from the sky.
