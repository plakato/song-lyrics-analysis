Eternally Unforgiven Lyrics
by X-Raided.


Bloc Star Bloc, Star 
Bloc, Star Bloc, Star Bloc, Star 
Yeah, Grown mans, music, bitch, 
Bloc, Star Bloc, Star Bloc, Star 
Yeah, Grown man, music, 
 
Long, as the world is spinnin 
Whether, I'm dead or livin 
I'll be hated forever, Eternally Unforgiven 
For all the times. I commited sins. 
Misery, never ends 
Havin visions of the flames. My soul will be burnin in 
I'll, be turnin in my grave Unable to find peace. 
With people prayin that I rest in grief. 
Let it be 
Long as the world is spinnin 
Whether, I'm dead or livin 
I'll be hated forever. 
Eternally Eternally Unforgiven 
 
While pregnant with me, 
Mama rubbed her stomach at night 
When I was born. 
She said she knew I would be somethin in life. 
Mama told me. I was a gift to the whole world 
Cause. She pushed me out and had a nut 
That made her toes curl Yeah 
She said: Look at his pretty eyes: 
What, a beautiful smile, 
He's, a bouncing baby boy, 
What, a beautiful child and he hardly ever cried 
So cute and peaceful 
Until. He turned 16 and started shootin at people, 
Now he's murderin innocent folks and bangin his gang 
Garden Blocc Loc's Deuce-Four 
Slangin, his caine Schemin to hide from mama 
Believin. The drama is painful: 
A demon in the streets, 
At home, he's mama's little angel 
I'm, the opposite of Nas 
Nefarious, X-Raided, 
I'm, hell's, son, 
Till, God's kingdom or hell comes 
I'll drop bombs, 
I'm the Spawn of Lucifer and my mom 
BlocStar Entertainment.com Welcome. 
It was 1991. When I came to the game 
And, I was ill before Cypress Hill was insane in the brain. 
Let me explain the real 
Give you a little history about the siccness 
And. What it was really meant to be 
Now what it meant to me. 
It was gangsta Shit. So pure 
It was sick, with no cure, Literally 
Wasn't no middle with me 
And to spit it. You had to live, it Represent it with me, 
Hear the genisis Reminisce with me 
The trinity in the beginning, 
It was Sicx Lynch and me 
Lynch was in the Gardens. 
Sicx stayed in the middle of The Creek 
When. I was freestylin to Dr. Dre instrumental beats. 
I was rhymin about car chases and nines sprayin clips 
When Scarface was a Geto Boy and his mind was playin tricks. 
When Pac was doin, the humpty dance with Digital Underground 
I was bangin Blocc Crip, Puttin, niggaroes underground 
By. The time I met, Sicx 
I was sick. With the spits 

We started, producing the hits 
That Niggas in Black EP and endangered Nigga Deep 
In 1991. We hit the streets in Sicx's, Caprice, 
, 
South, Sacremento, California, 
Garden Blocc, On Florin Rd.. In the Tower Records parkin lot 
We hit the neighborhoods where niggas like to spark the Glocks 
And. If they hated Stomped'em out, if they was hard or not 
And, I was 16 Havin, wicked and sick dreams. 
And witnessin Crips schemes on missions to get cream 
Seein apartment managers, evictin indigent fiends, 
Whose kids - will never know what legitimate innocent means scream 
Elicited by sick scenes. 
It was live and explicit and, as vivid as visions on split screens 
In, the Cadillac Apartments on Stockton,
