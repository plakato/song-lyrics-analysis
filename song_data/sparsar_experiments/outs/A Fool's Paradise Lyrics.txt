A Fool's Paradise Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

A warm summer sunrise.
Her eyes met his.
Love at first sight.
Not what it seems.
Love blossomed but ends suicide.
His charm was like a spell.
Disarmed, she follows to a cell.
Oh burning love, oh loving hate.
Cause' she doesn't want this.
But in this place there's no escape.
Our tragedy continues.
With a beating and a rape.

Is this heaven, or is it hell?
I'm drowning in these sheets.
She thinks loves such a heavy.
Burden do I sink.
He sells her all night.
From man after men.
Locks the door, hides the key.
Do you love me.
He says yes.
But his actions speak differently.

She striped of love.
He ?
Actions is the only thing that.
Speaks in situations like these.
You take so much.
But give so little.

He takes her downtown, buys her a red dress.
Branded, post? the boulevard.
Stranded, mascara's all a mess.
There's no escape except in her dreams.
So often she relives.
The horror in her sleep.
Business is good.
Sex sells.
Supply is cheap.
Demand is high.
And justice is blind.
Scared, careless, or a lie.
Buyers and sellers.
Live in a fool's paradise.

A single suicide.
A true tragedy.
Not how the story goes.
Romeo watches with apathy.
These violet delights have violent ends.
These violet delights have such violent ends.

Hello can you hear me?
My actions speak differently.
I'm sorry, really you're worth.
More than sex and money.
I am the fool, I know that means nothing to you.
My inactivity screams.
My words are untrue.
