Horsetail Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

He come up and.
Throw himself down.
He finds no strength to get off this ground.
By the wave of the horsetail.
By the wave of the horsetail.

He wishes no height.
No height in your mind.
To climb the steep hill none the can find.
If you think you can see it in your hand.
Then you are blind.

For unless he draw them.
They will not come.
For no man seeks him.
No not one.

There is number to your hours.
There is number to your hours.
You I don?t know.
From a stone?s throw.

If you think you can see it in your hand.
Then you are blind.

He bring the whirlwind.
To scatter your fire.
You cannot reach him.
No not from your.
Tallest spire.
