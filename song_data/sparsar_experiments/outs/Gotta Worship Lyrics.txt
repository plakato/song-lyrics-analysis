Gotta Worship Lyrics
by Virtue.

I can't figure out why You love me so.
When I strayed away, oh, You held me close.
I can't understand why Your love is free.
You keep on lovin' me into my destiny, oh, I've gotta.

Gotta worship You for who You are.
Cause You are the bright morning star.
I just gotta give You all the praise.
Gotta give You all the praise.

Gotta worship You for who You are.
Cause You are the bright morning star.
I just wanna give You all the praise.
I gotta worship You.

Got to worship You on high.
Cause You give me strength, You heal me within.
Got to give You all my praise.
In spite of my ways hear me when I say.

You walk with me through every obstacle.
Been right there through every situation by far.
Your word is true and I try to do what You tell me to do.
Cause if I do, I can be just as true as You.

Gotta worship You for who You are.
Cause You are the bright morning star.
I just gotta give You all the praise.
I just gotta give You all the praise.

Gotta worship You for who You are.
Cause You are the bright morning star.
I just wanna give You all the praise.
I gotta worship You.

Got to worship You on high.
Cause You give me strength, You heal me within.
Got to give You all my praise.
In spite of my ways hear me when I say.

Got to worship You on high.
Cause You give me strength, You heal me within.
Got to give You all my praise.
In spite of my ways hear me when I say.

I just wanna praise You.
Wanna give You all the glory.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord.
Thank You, Lord.

Wanna lift my hands to You.
Cause Lord, You've really been so good.
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord.
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord.

Gotta worship You for who You are.
Cause You are the bright morning star.
I just gotta give You all the praise.
I gotta worship You.

Gotta worship You for who You are.
Cause You are the bright morning star.
I just gotta give You all the praise.
I wanna worship You my God.

Got to worship You on high.
Cause You give me strength, You heal me within.
Got to give You all my praise.
In spite of my ways hear me when I say.

Got to worship You on high.
Cause You give me strength, You heal me within.
Got to give You all my praise.
In spite of my ways hear me when I say.

Oh, thank You, Lord, oh, I wanna thank You, Lord.
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord.
Oh, yeah, oh, I gotta give You all the praise, oh, I gotta.
