Fine Young Cannibals Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

In this house.
There's no order.
There's no loss of love out here.
If it's over.

I know I called.
Out to you.
Something is haunting these four walls.
You know it's true.

I will crawl.
Right back to you.
Under the smoldering summer sky.
I'll be there soon.

I've been told.
Of the new fast days.
There's some room to breathe but I don't think twice.
We'll be there soon.

Well all that's in my mind.
Has trickled out.
Won't let me breathe.

All that's in my mind.
Has trickled out.
Won't let me leave.

All that's in my mind.
Then we hold it.

My heart is clean.
Like a crater of the moon.
And the sea.
Of cackling gloom.

I'll be true.
True to you.
We may consume ourselves but I don't think twice.
I'll be there soon, so....

Well all that's in my mind.
Has trickled out.
Won't let me breathe.

All that's in my mind.
Has trickled out.
Won't let me leave.

All that's in my mind.
Then we hold it.

Uh oh, oh, there's nothing here.
Uh oh, oh, there's nothing here; here.
