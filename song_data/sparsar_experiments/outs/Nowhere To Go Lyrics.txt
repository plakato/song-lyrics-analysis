Nowhere To Go Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.


Traveling all around.
Don't know where to go X2.

Now where do I go.
Plans in my brain but they generate slow.
Juggling change but got none to blow.
Let out the air but the door it stay closed.
Saving my energy got to stay froze.
Stuck in this motion they loving the pose.
Getting it all is what I suppose.
I will have to do if i want to get rolls.
Of that paper.
Hair draper.
Mama need make-up.
My name makes it greater.
D.H.S.B don't forget the teenager.
Had the mouth of a weapon grenadier.
A shaker.
A remover.
I'm moving and shaking these losers.
I come out on top.
And y'all come on top.
So where do I go after choosing....

Traveling all around.
Don't know where to go.

Where do I go From here.
Not trying to follow my peers.
Drown myself in my own thoughts hear a voice that says come here.
Seen anxiety in his eyes and pain all up in his tears.
He showed me dreams of planes and things, and jewels and jets and leers.
Look out him for a while realized I was looking in a mirror.
Ok, that's me up in the future.
Please show me how to be you sir.
Stuck in this position no sutra.
But don't forget the cama.
Trying to solve my mamas problems.
But most of them are me.
But most of them aren't free.
So i got to work on my art please.
So ert, ert those car keys.
Get my little cousin barbies.
If one sick hit Walgreens.
Get my auntie.
Out of Aldies.
And then get her all these.
False dreams.
That's gnarly.
Because I'm balling like Spaulding.
I'm calling now falling.
Then raising.
Amazing.
He's changing, in good ways.
He lost braids.
Then got waves.
I can do that.
So where you at.
It don't buy love and time so I'm.

Traveling all around.
Don't know where to go.
