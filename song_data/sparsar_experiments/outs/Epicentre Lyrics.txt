Epicentre Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

I asked myself was I content.
With the world that I once cherished?
Did it bring me to this darkened place.
To contemplate my perfect future?
I will not stand nor utter words against this tide of hate.
Losing sight of what and who I was again.

I'm so sorry if these seething words I say.
Impress on you.
That I've become the anathema of my soul.

I can't say that you're losing me.
I always tried to keep myself tied to this world.
But I know where this is leading me.
Please.
No tears.
No sympathy.

I can't say that you're losing me.
But I must be that which I am.
Though I know where this could take me.
No tears.
No sympathy.

Gracefully.
Respectfully.
Facing conflict deep inside myself.
But here confined.
Losing control of what I could not change.

Gracefully.
Respectfully.
I ask you Please don't worry,.
Not for me.
Don't turn your back.
Don't turn away.

I can't say that you're losing me.
I always tried to keep myself tied to this world.
But I know where this is leading.
Please.
No tears.
No sympathy.

I can't say that you're losing me.
But I must be that which I am.
Though I know where this could take me.
No tears.
No sympathy.

No tears for me, no sympathy.
No tears for me, no sympathy.
