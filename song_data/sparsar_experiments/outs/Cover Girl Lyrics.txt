Cover Girl Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Stroll down the runway.
Another payday.
Cover of magazines.
And when they see me.
They want to be me.
I am your fantasy.

Cover girl!

Put the bass in your walk.
Head to toe let your whole body talk.

To Grumman's Chinese, Red carpet tv.
Valet my limousine.
Box office sweetie, An Oscar nominee.
Now watch me snatch trophies.

Cover girl!

Put the bass in your walk.
Head to toe let your whole body talk.

Walk...now walk...walk....now walk.
Walk...now walk...walk....now walk.
Come on baby, bring it.
For camera Ru, bring it.

Face, face, face, I get face.
Beauty face you can take, it's ok.
Watch my body go insane.
Everyone keeps looking at me.

You know I am Sarah P.
If u want to come for me and feel the meat.
Come right now and walk with me!

Stroll down the runway.
Another payday.
Cover of magazines.
And when they see me.
They want to be me.
I am the fantasy.

Cover girl!

Put the bass in your walk.
Head to toe let your whole body talk.

Pump and bump it.
Pump it and bump bump it.
Pump pump it and bump bump it.
Pump pump it and bump bump it.

Cover girl!

Put the bass in your walk.
Head to toe let your whole body talk.

Walk...now walk...walk....now walk.
Walk...now walk...walk....now walk.
