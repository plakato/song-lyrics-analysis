Neva Get Enuf Lyrics
by 3LW.

3L and Wayne what up 
 
Listen, I'm way better than that chump 
Sorry cause? I let her get her stuff 
Cause. She shiftin' with a brother who could never get enough of her 
I'd go tough for her could never do enough for her 
Mad love for her mad thoughts of her 
Days and days again. 
And I'm like Rocky where's, my Adrian 
Now holler, back 
Sweethearts bounce. If you feel me 
Little women love little me never get enough, 
 
Why! Every time I meet a guy who wants to try 
To get my mathematics. I deny 
He wants to take me home he's out of his mind. 
Will I ever meet someone for me. 
 
He's got ta, be the one 
That I'm daydreaming to spend my time with 
He's got ta, be the one 
With, no chicks attached, and that's my man, 
 
To, all my girls, that dream know what I'm talkin''bout 
The ones. That makes us cling to the thoughts of love, 
He's, so fresh he's so clean. Yes, I call and he calls me too 
That's - why he's bad my place his pad? I could never get enough 
 
I, I'm so glad I came across this kind of guy 
He. Didn'T ask me for my number. I thought why 
Then when I got the chance and now he's gentle inside 
Now he's the one. That'S got me open wide 
 
He's got ta, be the one 
That I'm daydreaming to spend my time with 
He's got ta, be the one 
With no chicks attached, and that's my man, 
 
To, all my girls, that dream know what I'm talkin''bout 
The ones. That makes us cling to the thoughts of love, 
He's, so fresh he's so clean. Yes, I call and he calls me too 
That's - why he's bad my place his pad? I could never get enough 
 
Mom. I stop to holler not to bother 
If you busy I'll wait out for hours. 
I'Mma stick my wait out all the way out for hours, 
What you know'bout bein' hot for hours and not from showers shh ... 
Not. Yet, though, how'bout some flowers 
How'bout, we hop the wild one knock out. Some lobster 
I could make your problems easy, stop. Jabbin' and slabbin' 
Weezy never get enough. 
 
To, all my girls, that dream know what I'm talkin''bout 
The ones. That makes us cling to the thoughts of love, 
He's, so fresh he's so clean. Yes, I call, and he calls me too 
That's - why he's bad my place his pad? I could never get enough 
 
To, all my girls, that dream know what I'm talkin''bout 
The ones. That makes us cling to the thoughts of love, 
He's, so fresh he's so clean. When I call him he calls me too 
That's. Why he's bad my place his pad? I could never get enough
