...Built Us A House Lyrics
by Swift.

They say you built up a house for those not found these days.
But you'd say... you built us a house, full and profound.

And now we're alive....

They say you built up a house for those left out like strays.
But you'd say... you built us a house, happy and proud.

And now we're alive....
