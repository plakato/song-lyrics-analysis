The Thing About It Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

Conscience a.k.a. Treefrog.
This is a time of growth for those that know.
And it's a time of hope for those that don't.
But if your mind is open you'll get shown.
We've had our sights blinded; All of my like-minded.
People need to get up and discover the right time; it's now.
Just start opposin' the powers that are rose.
In ancient days; And pave the way to disclothe it.
So control it's sickening; Most just sit and stare.
At a television with a distant glare.
And I'm ashamed to admit it, I'm a slave to the shit.
As much as anybody but I'm not afraid of it.
This is where the change comes in, this is where we make some difference.
Embrace what's within us; And escape from this prison.
All it takes is a little bit of faith.
And a little bit of love to get rid of all the hate.

But the thing about it is we can't just sing about it.
We can't just sit around and wait until they thin us out.
We figure out where we're goin' while we live in doubt.
If you want my truth, listen now, we'll just think about it.
The thing about it is we can't even think about it.
Can't afford a minutes time to figure how to bring about a change so.
Take a second and shake your head and then.
Take a step ahead and think about it.

Dusty Melodica.
Now the ball is in our court while we sit and watch passively.
The face of the earth changes drastically after we.
Clear space at this rate for strip malls and factories.
We risk take a cruel fate at a pace beyond gradually.
No more crops for us to harvest and feed.
Self-sufficiency replaced by clone copy-written seeds.
Now ask yourself how can we be free.
When the water that we drink is owned by some company.

Metty the Dertmerchant.
I hear the weap of the streets and cry's of the skies.
See weakness disguised as disceiptful lies.
But we all lead to survive; And sleep through our lives.
Weedin' for highs, all sheep and no pride.
Never speak of a lie; I let the fear fortify.
My inside's'll die tryin' to fit in the design.
I'm reminded daily of world gone crazy.
Guns mean safety for orphan babies.
Ignore the distortion, you're forced to perceive and believe.
What's supersede's as love but who agrees.

Mos Eisley.
Could you survive in the wild with a wife and child?
Our whole human history's a line, a type and a file.
So live your life in denial, and try to live on your own.
Without ya colour t.v., heat, fridge or the phone.
While the average guy lives an elaborate life.
Waits days a slave wage beneathe a passionate eye.
Now we ovulate, copulate and overpopulate.
Never stop to think about the things that we were taught to hate.
Now the stage is set, watch the players place their bets.
Take a sec, shake ya head, feel alive, make em' sweat.
Realize that the system can't exist with out belief.
Appreciate ya true potential, un-twist your mouth and speak.
We're workin' on buildin' a world our children can live.
Understand I can't be free while your still in this prison.
And I can spend my days preaching as so on and so forth.
But it won't change 'til we don't wanna go on no more.

Conscience a.k.a. Treefrog.
This is a time of growth for those that know.
And it's a time of hope for those that don't.
But if your mind is open you'll get shown.
