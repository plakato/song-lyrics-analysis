Always Lyrics
by Zion I.


Sitting in the oven is hot and people buggin' 
The world's separatin', I'm clickin' with my cousin 
This life's Quickening yeah, so sickening 
You've seen Highlander. You won't miss a thing 
Descend from a long lineage of brave kings, 
Working class people, everyday fighting, 
The blade. Striking where my hand writing 
Attack is increased, release, lightning, 
Swing, ma hammer like my nickname Thor 
But we children of the sun, so we spit Amen, Ra 
Beg. Your par' Come sit in my star ship 
Click light speed catapult into orbit, 
Ah the dark star. Yeah we going back home, 
The ancestors, always told me, act grown 
I came through got back, get better 
The body here and now, but the spirit lasts forever. 
And. That'S a mighty long time they say 
When any given moment it could be judgement day. 
We get down, though it seems like a set up. 
Love conquers, always you've got ta. Keep your head up. 
Love conquers always got ta. Keep your head up. 
Love conquers always got ta. Keep your head up. 
 
The clock doubling time to push the button. 
Relaying you're enlighten amen Is what I'm writing. 
My life a device to magnetize mics 
Insight, could take flight inside your own life. 
I, see we in for a change. We on ice 
To soar on I'mma, get my roll on 
I'm. So sore. My flow form is go on 
Undefeated and my style is impetuous. 
Get, your groove on move like Exodus 
This for the people, holla Jah 
Put up your hands in the air like Wah 
So blessed. We word of flesh, 
The vibration, installation pure fresh 
And. Success is a part of the get back 
Pray up stay in tune with the crip track, 
And give back to the people that need 
More strength and god as proceed. 
Indeed we can implant another seed 
And get down, though it seems like a setup. 
Love conquers always got ta. Keep your head up. 
Love conquers always got ta. Keep your head up. 
Love conquers always got ta. Keep your head! Up!
