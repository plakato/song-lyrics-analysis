Loving You Is Easy Lyrics
by Union J.


We were lost in the middle.
Like bottles in the ocean.
But we found one another.
Like the answer to a question.
Like words to a love song.
Like a rhythm to the Red Sea.
Finding you was so hard.
But loving you is easy.

Loving you is easy.
Loving you is easy.
Finding you was so hard.
Loving you is easy.

Instrumental.

We were lost in the middle.
Like bottles in the ocean.
But we found one another.
Like the answer to a question.

Jaymi.
Like words to a love song.
Like a rhythm to the Red Sea.
Finding you was so hard.
But loving you is easy.

Loving you is easy.
Loving you is easy.
Finding you was so hard.
But loving you is easy.

All.

George.
Finding you was so hard....

I think I've finally found the one.
Here comes the change.
I think the change has just begun.
I'm not the same.
I think I've finally found the one.
Here comes the change.
I think the change has just begun.
I'm not the same.
I think I've finally found the one.

We were lost in the middle.
Like bottles in the ocean.
But we found one another.
Like the answer to a question.

Josh.
Like words to a love song.
Like a rhythm to the Red Sea.
Finding you was so hard.
But loving you is easy.
