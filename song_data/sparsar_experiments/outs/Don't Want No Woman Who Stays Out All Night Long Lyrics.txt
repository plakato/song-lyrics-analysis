Don't Want No Woman Who Stays Out All Night Long Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Well, I don't want no woman.
She stay out all night long, Lord no.
She stay out all night long.
Don't want no woman don't know right from wrong.

And I don't want no lady.
Hair like drops of rain, hey hey.
Like drops of rain.
Well who am I if she treats them all the same?

Look down the road.
Far as my eyes could see, Lord no.
Far as my eyes could see.
Seem like nothing don't see by me.

And it's goodbye baby.
If you call that gone, Lord no.
If you call that gone.
You leave now, but you'll be back 'fore long.

Don't write no letter.
Call me on the phone, hey hey.
Call me on the phone.
Cause I'm goin' away and I won't be gone for long.

No, I don't want no woman.
Who stay out all night long, Lord no.
Stay out all night long.
Don't want no woman who dont know right from wrong.
