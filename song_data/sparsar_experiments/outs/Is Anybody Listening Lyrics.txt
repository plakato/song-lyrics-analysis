Is Anybody Listening Lyrics
by Unda Preshur.


I'M, taking what I can with a weapon or force 
Checking, my record is kinda like when you step in a storm 
I'm, giving all my best and it's yours, I was cut from a different cloth. 
You could tell from the very second I was born. 
 
Soon, as the kick rumbles feel it rush in my veins 
Guiding emotion through the pen an now I'm lovin the pain 
Cause. If it's something to you, then for me it's something to gain 
I'm a different person when my pen touches the page, 
 
Using ink as a medium. So you can relate to me. 
Never, pictured myself, a rapper, but music became a dream. 
I ain't blind by the coloured paper: that's stupidly, shaded green 
I'm. Only human, a human can make the scene 
 
All. The talent in the world couldn't make me a staple 
In, the rap game. So I assume I have to take when I'm able 
I have dreams of being with the greatest rappers that rhyme 
Release a couple albums that happened to be platinum and climb 
 
To, the top of the charts. You can stop for a moment, 
But deep inside. You truly know there ain't, no stopping the heart. 
I was playin at the start, but that mood soon changed 
Now. I display it as art and I'mma chew through brains, 
 
Is. Anybody listening, 
Who feel like me and feel like they. In my position too. 
I only have my life to give 
You need to understand that I got ta do this for you 
 
Is. Anybody listening 
Who feel like me and feel like they in my position too. 
They only love you when dead and gone 
I cherish every moment, because I know it's the truth. 
 
Soon as the kick rumbles feel it rush in my veins 
Guiding emotion through the pen an now I'm lovin the pain 
Cause. If it's something to you, then for me it's something to gain 
I'm a different person when my pen touches the page, 
 
Using ink as a medium. So you can relate to me. 
Never, pictured myself, a rapper, but music became a dream. 
I ain't blind by the coloured paper: that's stupidly, shaded green 
I'm. Only human, a human can make the scene 
 
Is. Anybody listening, 
Who feel like me and feel like they. In my position, too, 
I only have my life to give 
You need to understand that I got ta do this, for you 
 
Is. Anybody listening 
Who feel like me and feel like they in my position too. 
They only love you when dead and gone 
I cherish every moment, because I know it's the truth
