MÃ©moires (Prod. By Rikio Ito) Lyrics
by Tyam.


Every time i hop the beat its recognizable 
Everybody tryna. Be me its indescribable 
Undeniable for half of these people are unreliable. 
They may be denying what im implying, but what would lying do 
Streets of safari, so ima show em what a lion do. 
Roast em over to open fire, nothing to tie em to 
The jungle on my shoulders,
