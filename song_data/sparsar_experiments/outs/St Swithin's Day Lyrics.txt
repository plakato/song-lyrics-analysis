St Swithin's Day Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.


Thinking back now.
I suppose you were just stating your views.
What was it all for.
For the weather or the.
Battle of Agincourt.
And the times that we all hoped would last.
Like a train they have gone by so fast.
And though we stood together.
At the edge of the platform.
We were not moved by them.

With my own hands.
When I make love to your memory.
It's not the same.
I miss the thunder.
I miss the rain.
And the fact that you don't understand.
Casts a shadow over this land.
But the sun still shines from behind it.

Thanks all the same.
But I just can't bring myself to answer your letters.
It's not your fault.
But your honesty touches me like a fire.
The Polaroids that hold us together.
Will surely fade away.
Like the love that we spoke of forever.
On St. Swithin's Day.
