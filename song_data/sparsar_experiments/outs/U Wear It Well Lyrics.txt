U Wear It Well Lyrics
by RuPaul.


French tip, lipstick, painted on!

Value sure suits you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh!
Work it for me, work it for me, me.

Wig shop, nonstop, hair salon!

Value brand new-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Work it for me, work it for me, me.

Work that high-end.
tights!
She classy day and night!
Bone straight, lay it right!

Looking so, so chic!
Serving Le Mystique!
Repping Mozambique!

Don't let nobody tell you you ain't beautiful.
Go on and dream big, when you feel good it's possible.
So now you know the secret, lift up your voice and yell.
You wear it, you wear it, you wear it well!

French tip, lipstick, painted on!

Value sure suits you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh!
Work it for me, work it for me, me.

Wig shop, nonstop, hair salon!

Value brand new-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Work it for me, work it for me, me.

Sitting so in-sync!
She will not be tamed!
You know what I'm saying!

Laser set to stun!
Bitches come undone!
Serving Sensation!

Don't let nobody tell you you ain't beautiful.
Go on and dream big, when you feel good it's possible.
So now you know the secret, lift up your voice and yell.
You wear it, you wear it, you wear it well!

French tip, lipstick, painted on!

Value sure suits you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh!
Work it for me, work it for me, me.

Wig shop, nonstop, hair salon!

Value brand new-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Work it for me, work it for me, me.
