Guardian Angel Lyrics
by Swifty McVay.


This is dedicated 
To our fallen soldiers, 
The ones that had our backs like a spinal cord, 
We gon, keep you alive forever, 
Ain't, nothing! Anybody can tell us 
See when you was here. 
You showed us the way 
And. Now we gon na run with it 
And you, the realest niggas. I know 
 
This is dedicated 
To, the realest nigga. I know 
DeShaun Holton, 
We holdin' it down for you 
That's for sure 
You, a brother that touched lives. 
God called you home just to sit by his throne and watch over us as we roam 
This cursed earth. 
I wish you burst, outta that herse 
When I got word 
I swear that was definantly the worst day of my life. 
It stung 
Just, like it happen with Bugz 
A grown man crying 
Drowning in alcohol and drugs 
You kept to 100,000. To that ninth power, 
It hadn't been for you, I'd be hollerin at these cowards 
But I got ta, keep it cool 
And handle it like. You would do 
True to the game's, your middle name, 
Nigga, you, the truth, 
Six brothers that followed their dreams 
And its because of Proof, 
Irreplaceable 
You, the mayor 
Full perspective. There ain't nothin', they can tell us 
So I'mma, keep you closer to my hear than a blood vessel, 
That's Big Proof, forever: 
 
To, my guardian angel 
I'd, like to say thanks for 
Showin' us the ways to the game you irreplaceable 
This is dedicated to our brothers. For sure 
Never fake, the realest niggas, I know I know 
 
This is dedicated 
To, the realest nigga. I know 
I poured a shot of vodka 
He downed it. Before the show 
Everywhere. I go 
I'm repping you to the fullest 
If. I was there. 
I woulda jumped in front of that bullet 
Since day. One 
We battled in your Grandmother's basement 
Listenin' to tapes by J-Dilla 
I was wasted. 

You replied with a smile 
Since that day 
I wanted to learn how to freestyle 
Determined, to put the words together without jotin' 
Mobbin' to that hip-hop shop to get live, 
You sacrificed your time and energy gladly 
Just to keep everyone up in the circle remain happy. 
Your family is stronger than ever: 
Keeping it cool 
Thanks to God. 
Time heals wounds, 
I'll see you soon. 
Sometimes it gets hard. 
My heart is still scarred. 
But I'mma be reppin' Proof forever. 
'Till I'm gone. 
 
This is dedicated 
To the realest nigga. I know 
I, don't question our creator 
On why you had to go. 
Everything is for a reason. 
It taught me about these people 
And how they didn't care 
Faking, while they grieving 
And. I'M seeing things I didn't even see when you was here 
It's funny how God used you 
To make my vision. Clear, 
Some, niggas claimed 
They really knew you, but they didn't 
If. They did 
They, wouldn't have been dissin' us in the system. 
My eyes wide. 
I, listen! 
I'M steadily ducking and dodging these Jedi Mind Tricks, 
They, dishin', 
It ain't pissin' me off no more 
Cuz, I'm stronger 
A, brighter glow 
I, take control of the sitution 
And watch them haters fold. 
If the rains turn to snow 
Your name will be kept alive, consistent 
'Till its time for me to fly them skies. 
I'D like to say thanks for the time we shared 
And now 
I'd like to thank God. I keep an Angel by my side,
