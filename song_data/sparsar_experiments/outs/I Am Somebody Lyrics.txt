I Am Somebody Lyrics
by Que (FreeMind).


Is this my 7 p.m, Is is my time to shine.
Or is writing and rehearsing these rhymes a waste of time.
Cause I can prepare the dish, but I can't make them eat.
Just like I can't be someone else that's why this is me.

And I am a brother, a son, a man.
A nephew, a cousin, and somebody's best friend.
My goal is to reach happiness and touch fans.
Like my movie got hands,.
help the ignorant understand.

I'm only a human being, far from a paragon.
Not even close to perfection, but strive to go beyond.
But it feels like these burdens on my shoulder weight a ton.
Got me feeling like a pawn, that these bishops pray upon.

Feel like its dawn, my light is fading to darkness.
Try to stay strong, despite things going wrong.
Remind myself... Even wen I feel all hope is gon'.
And I'm feeling by myself I'm never truly alone.

Cause I am a brother, a son, a man.
A nephew, a cousin, and somebody's best friend.
Ignore haters when they say I never will succeed.
They just insecure trying to boost their self esteem.

Even when eating off food stamps and lack of support.
And my pops owing ten thousand in child support.
Got Mama up at the courts,.
despite what's upon me.
And burdens pressing on me, I am somebody.
