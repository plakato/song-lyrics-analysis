by 3LW.


Yeaa uh huh 
Yeaa uh huh 
Yeaa uh huh, 
Yeaa, uh, huh, 
Yeaa, uh, huh, 
Yeaa, uh, huh, 
Yeaa, uh, huh, 
Yeaa, uh, huh, 
 
Rollin' in the club, like what 
I got the view of you on lockdown 
Then. I saw you starin' at me. 
It wasn't soundin' too bad 
Ya. Make me think that your for one 
Lickin' your lips at me for fun 
While, the DJ's makin' him sway 
So! Won'T you come stare to me. 
If you 
 
 Wan na get down baby. I do 
Holla at me. Baby ooh-ooh 
If you rollin' deep tonight, then I do 
 Wan na know you 
And. If you wan na get down baby, it's cool 
Holla at me, baby, ooh-ooh, 
If, you're, always ridiculous! Then I do 
 Wan na get close to you. 
 
Your ice, your gear, your sex appeal, 
Your game. So tight, you got me feenin' 
Wantin', you alone with me. 
Is. The illest fantasy 
You make me feel like wilin' out 
Showin' you what it's about yeah 
Got it goin' on uptown 
Now. Let me see you work. It out on me, 
 
I'm sure you had me to get her baby 
Baby. How can I just make you see 
I'm the only one you need 
So, please. Let me know right now: 
Cause, it's true 
I want you 
Say that you want me too 
, 
Ladies and gentlemen 
I know I could make you scream like a woman' supposed to 
Seems. Like you, wan na get closer 
Well Boo. Here'S the ticket come through. We could kick it 
One hun', twenty five foot two is addictest 
My view is the sickest 
It's true been convicted, I'm probably needin' a girl, 
In other words ma I'm due for some kisses, I'm due for some huggin' 
And, all them dudes that be buggin'. I ain't with it 
I'm, through wit the thuggin' I'm due for some lovin' 
I, need a wife in my life and ma 
You're lookin', like you're, due for a husband 
I choose not to love'em 
These chicks, runnin' around actin', like straight fools in the public. 
Let'S move with the subject because I came with a better plot: 
Just play the game and you'll never flop. 
It'S in your brain. You already hot 
But, you ain't close to my age. So you better stop 
 
Let's, go! Don'T stop 
Let's, go, don't stop! 
Ah ha ha 
Yea, 
Yea 
I like this one right here: c'mon 
Hah, hah, 
Hah, hah, 
Hah, hah, 
Yea, hah
