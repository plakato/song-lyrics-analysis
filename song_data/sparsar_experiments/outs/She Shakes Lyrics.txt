She Shakes Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.


An angel queen
With, downy wings
While, i went out and was traveling
Came wandering
The bubble. King
From wandering and traveling
Through silver slivers
Of colours in his tail

Her arms begins to shake
Yes she shakes
She shakes
Yes. She shakes

She Oh bubble. King
You'Re everything
The, Sparkly inner fills my ring
When. You speak to me
In, dark heartbeats. The sound leaves me trembling

I, shiver, ever
I, quiver and quave
And. My heart begins to shake
Yes she shakes
She shakes
Yes. She shake
She

For all this wishes for all her queries and vision
Of, reckless hearts and rhythms
She shakes
Yes. She shakes
She
She shakes x2
Yes. She shakes
She
