To My Mother Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

Amherst, New Hampshire.
A daughter, the eldest of five.
Your nose in a book. Your quiet years.
Had your own idea of what your life would look like.
And now you're 18. Your life changed.
Left home, out west for the Golden State.
Met your love. Had us three boys.
Your life's painting was becoming a masterpiece.

With a steady hand and a tender touch.
A colorful mind. A creative heart.
You began painting my favorite piece.
Hanging in our dining room, that European landscape.

Your life is artistic. Gorgeous inside and out.
You catch the world's eye that falls for only the surface.
A picture is worth a thousand words. Here are a few of yours:.
Selfless, joyful, gracious, smart, beautiful.

We share our brown eyes. Look on the upside.
You gave me my smile and my music mind.
You pray every morning. Laugh everyday.
Work hard into evening. You'd rather paint the town.
Than sleep. Unlike Dorian Gray, mother, you age with grace. Every year you.
somehow grow into more of a masterpiece.

With a steady hand and a tender touch.
A colorful mind. A creative heart.
You're the heartbeat of this family. In a dark world.
You shine mother of pearl. Now I'm just trying.
To find a girl half of who you are.

Everyday I admire your painting.
I'm so grateful God gave you to me.
You color this world to make it look.
Like what your heart imagines it should be.
Your mark on our lives is never ending.
True Beauty is awe-inspiring.
When God takes you home.
All I want is your unfinished painting.
