Call of the Wind Lyrics
by Xandria.

Come and sail along the shores of your homeland.
See the waves that break onto the walls surrounding all.
Tell me.
Why have you lost all your wildest desires?
Where is the treasure to die for?
Is there a heart that longs for the unknown in yourself?
No one else but you can....
Sail away to the end of the seas.
The land of dreams, the child to release.
Once the horizon is left behind.
All you will hear's the Call of the Wind.
Leave behind the land that has been turned to grey.
Where the winds have whispered only from so far away.
Asking.
Why don't you face all your wildest desires?
When is the time that you wait for?
There will be nothing to lose but your fear.
So come on - and follow me now.
Sail away to the end of the seas.
The land of dreams, the child to release.
Once the horizon is left behind.
All you will hear's the Call of the Wind.
Sail away to the end of the seas.
The land of dreams, the child to release.
Once the horizon is left behind.
All you will hear's the Call of the Wind.
Voluntas numerit anima viva Wishes are still sleeping in your heart.
Sail away to the end of the seas.
The land of dreams, the child to release.
Once the horizon is left behind.
All you will hear's the Call of the Wind.
Sail away to the end of the seas.
The land of dreams, the child to release.
Once the horizon is left behind.
All you will hear's the Call of the Wind.
Turn the page and follow the lines.
Through words of fear and hidden signs.
Someday the story unveils what's within.
And it is yours, the voice of the wind.
Come and try to fight your demons away.
Before the coldness drives you insane.
