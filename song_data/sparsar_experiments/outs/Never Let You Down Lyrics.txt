Never Let You Down Lyrics
by Woodkid.


Will you come along cause I'm about to leave this town.
In my eyes, a waterfall,.
all I can hear, a siren call.
Could you be waiting by the shore, oh I could drown without you.
Will you be holding out the line when I fall?

Woodkid &amp; Lykke Li.
I'll never let you down, never let you down.
Never let you down, never let you down wooooh.
I'll never let you down, never let you down.

Have you ever had to be the one who sail away.
Have your heart torn apart, feel your love float astray.
Do you remember all the sounds, when I found you by the lake.
And how the water seemed to call your name.

Woodkid &amp; Lykke Li.
I'll never let you down, never let you down.
Never let you down, never let you down wooooh.
I'll never let you down, never let you down.

Woodkid &amp; Lykke Li).
Baby I will find you.
Baby I can hear you call.
Baby I can feel your heart.

Baby I will find you.
Just wait a little longer.
Baby I can hear you call.
I won't ever let you fall.

I'll never let you down, i'll never let you down.

Never let you down, never let you down.

Woodkid &amp; Lykke Li.
I'll never let you down, never let you down.
Never let you down, never let you down woooh.
Never let you down.
Never let you down.
Never let you down.
Never let you down.
Never let you down.
Never let you down.
