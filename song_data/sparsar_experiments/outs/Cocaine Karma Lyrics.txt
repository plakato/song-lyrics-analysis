Cocaine Karma Lyrics
by XOV.


I am nothing but a fool.
Left my family for you.
I'm a thief, a cheating liar - cocaine drama.
It's back, bad karma, karma.

You're my sickness, my health.
You know me too well.
I run but there's nowhere to hide.
Life is a bitch, just give me my fix.
Hit me and bring me to life.

You take me to heaven and leave me in hell.
Cocaine karma.
You take me to heaven and leave me in hell.
Cocaine karma.
Cocaine karma.

Twenty winters have come and gone.
I still know nothing 'bout my only son.

You're my sickness, my health.
You know me too well.
I run but there's nowhere to hide.
Life is a bitch, just give me my fix.
Hit me and bring me to life.

You take me to heaven and leave me in hell.
Cocaine karma.
You take me to heaven and leave me in hell.
Cocaine karma.
Cocaine karma.
Cocaine karma.

I was high as hell one day, walking asleep.
Homeless on Stockholm Street.
I bumped into a woman and child that looks like me.
That's my wife and my son, ten years I've been gone.
I don't know what to say.
So I just look back and smile before I walk away.

You're my sickness, my health.
You know me too well.
I run but there's nowhere to hide.
Life is a bitch, just give me my fix.
Hit me and bring me to life.

You take me to heaven and leave me in hell.
Cocaine karma.
You take me to heaven and leave me in hell.
Cocaine karma.
Cocaine karma.
Cocaine karma.
Cocaine karma.
