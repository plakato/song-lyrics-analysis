â€‹heartsigh Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


Whisper whimper on I
Won't forget to close your eyes for you
I'll sing before you lie down. Down
And push your sleep along

I'll sink below the ground
Find. The weeping wailing calls you echo in
I'll build a house around you
Stir a moat until you drown down

Refrain
I'll whisk away your heartsigh
And bury it in mine
I'll, whisk away your heartsigh
And bury it in mine

Only lonely, hidden breath beneath the floor
Only. Only where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely hid the morning from the stars
Only. Only weeping glimmers in the dark

I can hear your back crackin'
O'er the sky, so you could wear it
Thunder whispered, low so
You could bare it in

Refrain
I'll whisk away your heartsigh
And, bury it in mine
I'll, whisk away your heartsigh
And bury it in mine

Come down come now back
Carry on wearily on
Come down. Come now back
Carry on wearily on

Only lonely hidden breath beneath the floor
Only. Only where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely hid the morning from the stars
Only. Only weeping glimmers in the dark

Refrain
I'll whisk away your heartsigh
And bury it in mine
I'll, whisk away your heartsigh
And bury it in mine
