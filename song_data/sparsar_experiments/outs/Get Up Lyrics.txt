Get Up Lyrics
by Virtue.


I remember back when I was a little, young girl.
I remember mama saying,.
you can't sit there,.
when it's time to give the Lord some praise.

Now evidently she knew exactly.
Where the praise would get me.
That's why.

Now I remember when situation's.
Had me kind of hindered.
But my spirit kept saying,.
I can't sit there,.
When it's time to give the Lord some praise.

When the praise is over.
The weight it really lifted off my shoulder, that's why.

Now it was kind of weekly.
That on the job, the devil tried to get me.
That's why you hear me keep saying.
You can't sit there,.
I told you, you slap the devil's face.

Now when I get that praise.
On the job, it couldn't come my way.
That's why.

Now the doctor told me, from day to day.
I've got to take it easy.
That was just like him saying,.
You can't sit there.
Cause it's time to give the Lord some praise.

Now when my body was achin'.
A something in my hand a got to shakin'.
That's why.

Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

Get up, get up, get up, get up.
When the praise is going up.
Get up from your seat now.

Now if you want to go and tell.
The person sittin' next to ya.
Don't you hear what I say,.
You shouldn't sit there.
Cause it's time to give the Lord some praise.

Now if I had it my way.
These chairs wouldn't even be here no way.
Cause.

Now if you think you lost it.
And you're lookin' for some joy for it.
First you got to.
Don't site there.
Cause it's time to give the Lord some praise.

And before you know it.
Something in your body starts to show it.
That's why.

Now everybody just keep saying.
You can praise without me.
Sooner or later you gonna wish you.
From sitting.
Cause you need the Lord to come your way.

And then you want to get.
The elders to pray for you.
But I told you.
