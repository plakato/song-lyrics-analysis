Till The World Ends (Single Version) Lyrics
by Twister.

When you were standing in the wake of devastation.
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown.
And with the cataclysm raining down.
Inside's crying Save me now.
You were there impossibly alone.

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known.
Remember all the sadness and frustration.
DJ, what you, wha-a-a-at you waiting for?

And in a burst of light that blinded every angel.
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars.
You felt the gravity of tempered grace.
Falling into empty space.
No one there to catch you in their arms.

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known.
Remember all the sadness and frustration.
DJ, what you, wha-a-a-at you waiting....

See the sunlight, we ain't stopping.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
If you feel it, let it happen.
And keep on dancing till the world ends.
Keep on d-d-d-d-dancing till the world ends.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known.
See the sunlight, we ain't stopping.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
If you feel it, let it happen.
And keep on dancing till the world ends.
