Bad Idea Lyrics
by Yuna.


What is this I feel about you?
Hoping not to make it an issue.
I don't want to be nice at all.
You're only causing trouble.
Are you can stay if you want to.

And being in love with you seems like a really bad idea.
But when I'm not with you I'm wishing I could have you nearer.

Please do not allow me to miss you.
I'm trying my best to keep my distance.
I don't want to give you my heart.
But it seems to like you a lot.
Do you feel the same way, too?

I'm never going to, never going to, never going to.

Be that girl again who trust you when you're over.
And falling in love with the wrong kind of boy who will only break my heart to.
a million pieces.
Oh I went through it before I've had enough heartaches.
Now I'm trying be smart about it.
But you just crash in like the waves.
Now all I think about is you.

You near, you near, you near, you near.
Such bad idea.
Okay.
