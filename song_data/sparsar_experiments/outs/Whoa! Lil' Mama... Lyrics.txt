Whoa! Lil' Mama... Lyrics
by X-Con.


Shake it, pop it, bounce it, twist it.

Whoa lil mama.
I can't believe this.
Whoa lil mama.
My bank you tryna receive this.
Whoa lil mama.
You gotta twerk.
Whoa lil mama.
I mean work it.

Look, la-la-look I'm in the club.
But before I spend a dub.
You gotta bring it here drop it down and pop it up.
Open it hold it there let see that there.
I don't care where you shake it just don't drip it in my cup.
Now hold up you too fast.
You gotta touch your toes lil mama shake that ass!
Wanna back up view a close up for that shot.
Five dollars will get you a tabletop.
But it won't stop drop to your ankles.
And do some tricks to make a nigga wanna spend this bank roll.
Head to the bar to cop a bottle now I'm faded.
I'm a big balla now I know yall niggas sho hate it.

Na-na-na-now daddy like the way that you be shaking your butt.
Opening up I guess it's time to get in the gut.
Keep talking it girl but money ain't thang like your main.
Don't you see that blang blang in my chain or in my watch.
I'm straining I'm hot main like 97 octane.
Twenty dollars for five dollar baby.
Cuz I'm flossing a hundred g'z in a year.
Whoa lil mama vip's rite chea.

Shake it, pop it, flip it, bounce it lil mama.
Make a nigga wanna dick bend ya ass over.
Flex your pussy muscles.
Girl you want these hundred g'z.
Girl you got ta hustle.
Bounce your ass up and down like that.
I like that!
Put your titties in my face so a nigga can bite that.
Turn around to that back and let me get a lap dance.
Lil mama you got me about to bust a nut in my pants.
All that teasin your boy I ain't with that there.
After the club you gotta let a nigga hit that there.
Here go with B.
Tell your boss man you gotta leave the club early.
Ya heard me cuz tonight you finna get your knees dirty.
