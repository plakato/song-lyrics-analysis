Secret Lyrics
by Queen of Hearts.


One step, moves closer.
But two steps, I'm taken back.
Three steps, together.
My fourth step, is off-track.

If your life is a staircase.
We can only ever climb or fall.
When you start at the beginning.
The road isn't always so long.
If you're reaching for the ceiling.
You can never really touch the sky.
When seeing is believing.
We're always free-falling through life.

I need to feel it.
And it's not a secret.
I won't leave until I hear you say.
I need to feel it.
And it's not a secret.
I'm scared to love you if you feel the same.

Five steps could change me.
I'm six steps behind you.
Eight steps were lonely.
And seven, my virtue.

Interlude.

Do you feel the same.
Do you feel the same.
Do you feel the same.
