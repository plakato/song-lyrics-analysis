10
by Wolfmother.

They came from 10,000 feet.
On a possibility street.
It was the law of the land.
Turned castles into the sand.
When it's only kingdoms a turning.
When I've got to find out some learning.
Even the people so small.
Wanna see the tyrant fall.
Oh yeah.

You could be.
What you see.
Anytime.
This time.
Could it be.
What you see.
You could be.
In time.

Your love.
My love.
Our love.
In time.
Your love.
My love.
Our love.
Yeah in time.

It was the law of the land.
Turned castles into the sand.
Somehow the machine prevailed.
Another torture tale.
It's only kingdoms a turning.
Watching the factories burning.
Even the mountain so tall.
Will see the tyrant fall.
Oh yeah.

Anytime.
You could see.
What should be.
In time.
Could it be.
Everything.
That you see.
Is fine?

Your love.
My love.
Our love.
In time.
Your love.
My love.
Our love.
Yeah in time.

Take the time to see.
The other things in life.
Are all around.
You never get the time.
To see all this.
About me anyway.
Your love.
My love.
Will stand in time always.
