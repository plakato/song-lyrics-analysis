Passive Aggressive Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


Sometimes I'm passive aggressive.
No, more like all the time what I meant.
And this porch is pessimist leveling.
From the optimist in a second.
With a chain necklace feeling like a pit bull under Vick's view.
I'm restlessly wreckless, man I'm simply leftless.
Split right down the mid of me with a six foot blade.
Sike, what I mean is a chainsaw with salt on the teeth.
Take a picture, stare at it nonstop for the rest of your life.
That's how I'm feeling, for real.
I'm mixed up like a lesbian dick-suck.
Pick it up from the dirt one more time.
Then rip the cunt up of life like one whore, dime.
And a nick combined found on the internet through a Vine.
Then you threw up a nine.
My damn mind is overrun by this subconscious overlord.
Going overboard but we're alone in one so we know the more.
And I'm passing out my best and I'm backing out my lessons.
Sometimes I happen to mess with being a passive aggressive.

Back in a rut, back's to the wall, sides and front.
Put an axe in them all even if they holding up your building.
Still in that mode, attacking them all.
Blasting a mall filled with people, I'm evil.
Innocently black in the heart.
Dart gun shot at me in the dark.
So I couldn't freely see the poison at the mark.
Wounded one but I'm still running.
Jogging's for pussies cumming.
And everyone is nothing.
Motherfucker prove me wrong I'm fucking sick.
And upchucking something like trucks.
And I'm ready to leave at any moment.
My poles are broken.
No man can withstand this potion brewing.
This locomotion viewing is looming over my life fluent.
But I am strong, hard as rocks and steel, effervescent.
Antidepressants are the essence of death.
But they're so suppressive yet I know I'll regret it.
So I press shit into the back of my mind.
My selective Heaven, the life of a passive aggressive.
