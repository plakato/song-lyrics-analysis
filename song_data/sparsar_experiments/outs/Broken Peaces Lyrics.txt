Broken Peaces Lyrics
by Wrekonize.

Colonel Green: In a Job like yours.
even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.

This coliseums calling me again, how bloody convenient.
I let bygones go by, but the tide change ain't lenient.
See my mind state is 5 takes from an irate infection.
A little bit of the yes sirs and a routine funk inspections.
I've been a child of change since Willy Maze was saying hey.
But I wouldn't steal my first base until late like 88.
But never the less I must confess.
I've mastered all the tons of stress by letting excess press the mess up up.
from off my weathered chest.

I found my peace, let me be or take my breath away from me. Down these streets.
chasing dreams I'm not quite sure I can reach.

Got a message from the afterlife, my relatives are well.
I replied that I need heavens help.
This hemisphere is hell.
I coughed into this cradle later hoping it would swell.
But a line on the equators only parallel to twelve.
You go get your disciples, I be getting mine as well.
But mine don't bow to hanging hats what some would William tell.
I walk around this rock till I'm out of schemes to sell.
And follow every rising sun until the day is fell.

I found my peace, let me be or take my breath away from me. Down these streets.
chasing dreams I'm not quite sure I can reach.
