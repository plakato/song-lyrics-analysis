Swooner Lyrics
by The Zolas.

Miss mythical 
She's like the way they were 
I pass, pass her notes 
And. She goes Oh honey. It'S alright, 
 
When, the arrows volley down. Will you stay with me? 
Build, a fire out of pages of magazines. 
Someone, like you, don't come around every dynasty, 
A swooner! That'S what you are 
 
Top of a class 
Top of a field 
A future. It'S all. The head-hunter's got 
Her name on their lips: 
Yeah she's, the spine to a body of friends, 
That incandescent girl of Incan descent, 
 
When, the arrows volley down. Will you stay with me, 
Build a fire out of pages of magazines. 
Someone, like you, don't come around every dynasty, 
A swooner! That'S what you are: 
 
Feel my temperature rising 
Like, a comet colliding 
Feel, my temperature rising 
Feel. My temperature feel my temperature 
 
When. The arrows volley down will you stay with me: 
Build, a fire out of pages of magazines. 
Someone, like you, don't come around every dynasty, 
A swooner! That'S what you are!
