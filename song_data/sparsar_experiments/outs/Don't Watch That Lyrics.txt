Don't Watch That Lyrics
by Que.


Pull up in some shit you never seen.
All these damn diamonds in my chain.
Yes I got the 40 in my jeans.
Imma get this guap by any means.
Nigga don't watch that, don't watch that.
Nigga don't watch that, don't watch that.
Nigga don't watch that, don't watch that.
Nigga don't watch that, don't watch that.

Pull up in some shit you never seen.
Savage got the 30 with the beam.
All I gotta do is tell him squeeze.
Turn this bitch into a murder scene.
Who said it's a drought up on the lean.
Sell it to you cut, it won't be clean.
All my girlfriends say I'm mean.
Got it bad for selling bitches dreams.

My watch is a Rollie so is my.
chain.
At Johnny go icey, flood out the face.
Tell Watchbusters my shit is far from fake.
Don't know about y'all, but my shit 20K.
My bitches exquisite in Vera Wang.
I call up the plug and we speaking slang.
If 12 pull up, no I ain't seen a thang.
Tell 'em go fuck yourself, I won't cooperate.
