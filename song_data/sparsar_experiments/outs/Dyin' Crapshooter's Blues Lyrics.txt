Dyin' Crapshooter's Blues Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Well now Jesse was a gambler.
Night and day.
He used crooked cards and dice.
Son of a guy, good-hearted.
He but had no soul.
His heart was hard and cold like ice.
Jesse was a wild reckless gambler.
The one game he could not win.
Sweet Lorena 'outta north atlanta.
She done stole his heart from him.
And she was married to a rich man.
With a house on a hill.
But Jesse had to see her still.
So come the shadows of night.
He came around.
And he cut the old man down.
Broke his heart.
Left him cold out alone.
Sweet Lorena packed up and gone.
And the police walked up.
And shot my friend down.
Said Boys, I gotta die today.
He had eight crapshooters.
Around his bedside.
To hear the words he had to say.
guess I 'otta know exactly hows I wanna to go.
How you wanna go 'ole Jesse?
Eight crapshooter to be my pallbearers.
Let 'em all be bailed down in black.
I want nine men.
Going to the graveyard, buddy.
But just eight men are coming back.
I want gamblers.
Gathered around my coffin side.
A crooked card upon my hearse.
Don't say the crapshooters.
Are allowed to grieve over me.
That there doggone curse.
Water my grave with some moonshine.
Now dig it with the ace of spades.
I want 12 polices in my funeral march.
High sheriff 'bout to led the parade.
I want that judge who jailed me.
14 times to put a.
A pair of dice in my shoes.
Let a deck of cards be my tombstone buddy.
I got the dyin' crapshooters blues.
16 real good crapshooters.
16 bootlegger there to sing songs.
16 hobos off the casey line.
To kick up dust while I'm rollin' along.

Or.

Well his head was achin'.
His heart was thumpin.
Jesse went down bouncin' and jumpin' said.
folks don't be standin around moanin' and cryin.
He wants everybody to do the charleston whilst he dies.
One foot up and a toenail draggin'.
Throw my buddy Jesse.
In the hoodoo wagon.
Come here mama.
With your can of booze.
Dyin' crapshooter's blues.
The dyin' crapshooter's blues.
Goin down with the dyin' crapshooter's blues.
