A Love So Pure Lyrics
by Underoath.

Always did it on my own, then one day I realized I was blind.
Nothing I could do on my own turn.
We have found a way to see, look up, feel the Almighty.
Take control as we gaze into Your eyes.
We're just the tool You use to bring this world to You.
Oh, Lord, how we love You.
With Your grace, take away the hurt and the bruises inside.
Reach down, let Your glory reside.
The cross carried for all of us, paint the image in my mind.
So I will never think I am something.
But nothing am I but You, You are something.
Lord You keep me alive, You give me rest at night.
When there seems no way to find calmness in the storm.
You come and take me in Your arms.
And then the waves drown me no more.
With You, I'll last this battle and many others.
Through the ages, Your name will reign forever.
Never to be replaced in these trials I face.
I pray You, humble me, humble me.
I want to be like You, Jesus, more and more like You.
I was crucified on that day with Christ.
Nailing You there with sin, accepting You.
I nailed my soul to the cross and now my life begins.
This world so cold but Your love keeps me warm.
My father holds me in his nailed scarred hands which I put there.
But for some reason, he still loves me with all his heart.
Even through I betray him constantly.
He always keeps his arms open waiting, till I give up my old ways.
God my father, You are the only one that can give me comfort.
You touch my heart in such a way that all I can do is cry Your name.
Jesus Christ, I love You.
My heart aches for Your love.
