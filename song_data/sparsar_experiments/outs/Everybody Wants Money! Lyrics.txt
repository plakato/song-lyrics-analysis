Everybody Wants Money! Lyrics
by Viza.


Everybody wants money.
Everybody wants money.
Everybody everybody everybody, yeah!
Everybody wants money.
Everybody wants money.
Everybody everybody everybody, yeah!

Yeah!

Banks and cathedrals are the villains of the night.
Bet you can never catch them wide-eyed!
Tied to the anvil is our darling concubine.
Where will she dine tonight? Oh my....

Riding the coattails are the toadies chewing chives.
Playing the trumpets throughout the night. Why?
Smoking Cohiba's on any given night.
Where will I find me a light? Oh my....

Well, now your secrets are safe with me.
There's a blind man loans advice and depending on what he'll see, he'll be.
willing to meet your price...you are so hot! You are so hot! You are so hot!
Oh!

Fly with me.
Side with me.
Hide with me my only love.

Cry with me.
Lie with me.
Die with me my love!

Everybody wants money.
Everybody wants money.
Everybody everybody everybody, yeah!
