GOD Lyrics
by Punsy.

I'D give my life in less than a second just to stand in. His presence
He has never been second ... to anything
I heed his message and lessons, and I will never forget them
Cuz When I rest in the heavens. I know I'll rest in peace
I love God in untangible. Amounts
He'S blessed me so much. On both hands. I couldn't count
How much he's done throughout my life
He's keeping evil out of my house at night
And day. every chance I may I pray you stay
Cuz. It'S easy for dre to stray away
I. Don'T wan na see these days just fade to grey
And. I know his son J was slain to save
Me. So every day he's gained my praise
I try my hardest, but there Ain't no way to say
Thanks cuz. My days are A-Okay
His glory. Helped me pave a way to grace
 ... I'd be nothin' without him
Since the month that I found him He's been somethin', astoundin'
I'm, Never fussin' and poutin' or cussin' and shoutin'
 .... I'D rather spread his love to hundreds of thousands
And let'em all know he built the structures around em
The sun to ground. the ice that covers the mountains
He's, the one who helped me discover my talents
It's sad cuz y'all, rather praise a couple: medallions
