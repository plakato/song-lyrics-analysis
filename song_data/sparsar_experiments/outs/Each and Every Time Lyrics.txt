Each and Every Time Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Whoa, whoa.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh.
Whoa, whoa.
Oh, baby.

Some lovers dazzle me.
With their limousines and pearls.
They wine and dine you.
And they promise you the world.

But then the party's over.
Everything is changed.
The fire's gone.
And nothing else remains.

With you.
It's more than just a passion.
With you.
I know that love will last.

When you look in my eyes.

You lift me up so high.
Each and every time.
Each and every time.

And when the world is cold.

You're always there to hold.
Each and every time.
Each and every time.

I've had to pay the price.
Of knowing how to love.

Who never could get enough.

You are the reason.
I can take another chance.
Cause you know the meaning of a true romance.

With you.
It's more than just a passion.
With you.
I know that love will last.

When you look in my eyes.

You lift me up so high.
Each and every time.
Each and every time.

And when the world is cold.

You're always there to hold.
Each and every time.
Each and every time.

Whenever you're around.

My heart's up in the clouds.
Each and every time.
Each and every time.

And when you take my hand.

I know you understand.
Each and every time.
Each and every time.

Every time you call my name.
It thrills me just the same.
And I know.
I'll always feel this way.

T-t-t-turn it out.
Whoa, whoa.

With you.
It's more than attraction.
With you.
I know this love will last.

Whoa, whoa.

You're the one.
Who makes me feel this way.
Always in your arms.
I'll stay right here with you, baby.

I'm yours and yours.
And yours alone.
You will always be the one.
And I don't mean maybe.

Haven't got a taste for material things.

Boy I don't need no diamond ring.
You know I know just what true love can bring.

You're my everything.

My everything.

What true love can bring.

When you look in my eyes.

You lift me up so high.

Each and every time.
Each and every time.

And when the world is cold.

You're always there to hold.

Each and every time.

Each and every time.

Whenever you're around.

My heart's up in the clouds.

Each and every time.
Each and every time.

And when you take my hand.
I know you understand.
Each and every time.
Each and every time.
