Ablivion Lyrics
by UNKLE.

This is how it all begins.
A ride into oblivion.
Faster than we've ever been.
Faster than we've ever been.
Listen to the city scream.
Stranded in another dream.
Further than we've ever seen.
Further than we've ever seen.
Electric shock and we begin.
A mile above the mess we're in.
Higher than we've ever been.
Higher than we've ever been.
So far gone I won't ever stop.
I'll let you go and watch you drop.
So far gone I can't hold a grip.
Another hit and watch us slip.
So far gone I won't ever stop.
For all that I am, for all that I'm not.
So far gone the edge I'm on.
I see it now, oblivion.
This is an awakening.
This is what the children sing.
Higher than we've ever been.
Higher than we've ever been.
See the lights we left behind.
Stranded in another time.

?
This is where it all begins.
We cross into oblivion.
This is where it all begins.
We cross into oblivion.
So far gone I won't ever stop.
I'll let you go and watch you drop.
So far gone I can't hold a grip.
Another hit and watch us slip.
So far gone I won't ever stop.
For all that I am, for all that I'm not.
So far gone the edge I'm on.
I see it now, oblivion.
I see it now, oblivion.
Oblivion.
