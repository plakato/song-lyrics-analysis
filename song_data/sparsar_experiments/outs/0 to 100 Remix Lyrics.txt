0 to 100 Remix Lyrics
by Yung ELi.

Life is a bitch wit all that bullshit.
Mind so heavy feel like I'm gona lose it.
Fuckin wit these losers got me going 0 to a hundred real quick make me.
Wanna kill shit real shit.
I'm in the stu smoking till I can't feel shit.
Put the pain in my bars kan u feel this.
Smokin dope spittin krack where the deal is.
I'm hungry for success like where the meal is.
I'm hungry for success like where the mill is.
I want a billion and a badass brazilian.
Who give good brain I mean shorty brilliant.
Cold ass nigah don't mean we chillin.
Its a cold world so fuck ya feelings.
Burning good ni**as smell me wen I walk in.
Always loud just incase haters talkin.
They don't want red sox like boston.
Just because my ni**as r too cautious.
Word to mutha fake ni**as make me nauseous.
Stay running they mouth like a faucet.
Who the fuck let these fa**ts out the closet.
Now these ni**as like aw shit.
Nnodays off everyday gon feel like august.
Grind hard til u get up on ya boss shit.
I'm working hard like I'm stuck up in the office.
Let em talk bitch nigahs always gossip.
Like its progress that's why they never got shit.
Talking hot shit I'm focused on the top bitch.
Middle fingers to you haters like the cops bitch.
