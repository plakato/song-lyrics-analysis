Dice 3style Lyrics
by Yungen.


I think I should say RIP to the beat from now.
Hey yo, that's a cheeky remark you know Yungen.
But I'm gonna let you off with that.

Oi, let's go.

I be all over my chips man, brudda check my source.
Same old kid man, bow legged walk.
If I blow, a Lambo's what my bro's getting bought.
Make a young don eat, tell him go and get a fork.
Man we just tryna live this high life.
Raise your glasses, I've got the clearest eyesight.
I've done the road ting, I'm tryna get my life right.
Tryna get a Jacob on my wrist, Twilight.
Man I'm the baddest lyricist, done the banter.
Me, I'm the master, it's bait you're just a wanker.
I heard he's onto me, waiting for the green light, my stick rolls when it was.
amber.
Cause I ain't tryna take a chance with my life.
You couldn't roll on my board, you ain't hardly a dice.
I'm tryna hit my target, I ain't one for misses, explains the reason I.
departed my wife.
She acts stush but undercover she an undercover.
Baby daddy but she fucking with another brudda.
I'm like come on brudda.
I be beating your BM while your kid's at home, I'm a mother fucker.
We got the bed shaking.
Drawers shaking.
Floor shaking.
I put my balls in her mouth, jaw-breaking.
You niggas running round cause you got bored spraying.
My niggas put in hand work when the four's playing.
Whole bag of bodies, peak where I'm living.
A lot of man are snitching, I ain't tryna be a victim.
I've got a Z of both, I cut it up in the kitchen.
Cause all I do is make fucking cake, Mr. Kipling.
Something ain't right, something needs pitching.
Every day I'm walking with this ting, I'm itching.
Take them out from one pop, put it into spray.
House party, I show a fucking kid I don't play.

And yeah, that's how we do man.
Remember look out for the video on YouTube.
Dice, Yungen freestyle.
Hang tight Jayster.
