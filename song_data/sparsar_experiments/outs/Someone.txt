Someone
by Xavier Simmons.

I wanna feel needed.
I wanna feel loved.
The passion of a kiss.
The warmth of love.

Walk through the park.
Holding your hand.
In a perfect world.
I'd never be alone.
And left to die in the sand.
Someone to cry with me.
On the floor.
Stories I keep locked away.
The dreams I failed to chase.

I wanna feel needed.
To exist to be loved.
To be told that you'd fall apart.
If I should leave your site.

Someone will care.
If I'm gone.
