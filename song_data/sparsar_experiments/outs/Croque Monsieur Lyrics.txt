Croque Monsieur Lyrics
by Wordburglar.


Start the jam 
I'm bringing words together like an ampersand 
Wordburg 
'Bout, to make your goddamn Pampers damp 
Slamming amps off the ramp 
Hitting, the Tamtam 
Classier than your tramp-stamp aunt in a trans-am 
Call Bran Van 
This shit is 3000 
A habitat for humanity, 
Free housing, 
Help people Move 
Thanks for giving a listening 
To everywhere you go, 
Like pigeons in Islington, 
Different 
Never tried or play it shock. Rappers 
Like, seeing Vinnie Paz in a pride parade 
My time a day is every time a rhyme is sprayed 
And, I'm good without the shine 
Like. A diamond in the shade 
Whether, your favorite, Slaughterhouse, 
Is, ace or Ace or Kurt Vonnegut 
If. You make a mix-tape 
Make sure you got a Burg song on it. 
A hominid 
Who likes his PlayStation, moddedded 
Style self taught 
And. I let myself audit it. 
 
Oh shit. 
This ain't, a ham-and-cheese, 
Its Croque, Monsieur 
Promoting dope, coast-to-coast 
Like, a pot-sticker 
How. Could I not give her 
What? Am I chopped liver, 
Don't? Think it's hot 
I don't buy it like a shoplifter, 
Lyrical Croque, Monsieur 
Making, you plot thicker, 
Promoting dope, coast-to-coast 
Like, a pot-sticker 
How. Could I not give her 
What? Am I chopped liver, 
Don't? Think it's hot 
I don't buy it like a shoplifter, 
 
And. I keep warming up 
Like. Someone had just bought me. A sweater, 
Cause good things. Take time, 
Like a watch. Repossessor 
Never leave you hanging 
Count on your Burgy 
For, more lines: 
Than a sale at Burberry, 
Subverting 
Can I get a five like Laurier 
Cause being boring, is so cliche 
Oh behave 
I stay on the mound like Halladay 
When. I see an alien. I say: “Salame ” 
From salad days 
To. All you can eat luncheons 
Get attention like F-Bombs at family functions, 
Curmudgeons 
Wondering 
What, the hell is he doing 
Who's your target demographic 
Humans 
Whether, your consuming Macaroons 
Out in Saskatoon 
Or back in Hali, 
Cracking brews in the afternoon. 
If someone says 
That they're better than you 
They're, just a fraud 
Like a vegan wearing leather, at a zoo,
