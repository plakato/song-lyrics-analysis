Thoughts At The River Lyrics
by QMC.

Weed lean everything I need
I don't need to fall. Asleep
Cause, I'm livin what I dream
Its the black Charles Manson
But, I'm handsome lookin clean
Hippie bitches on my dick
When. I'M rappin on beat
I got drugs by the pound
When. Your loves, not around
Got, mansion made of clouds
So, I'm never coming. Down
My girl. Look like a Courtney, Cox
Livin life like Courtney, love
Yeah she's, doin, more than pot, but she ain't ever shooting drugs
