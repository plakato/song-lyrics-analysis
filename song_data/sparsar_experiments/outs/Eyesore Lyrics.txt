Eyesore Lyrics
by Women.

Spill and heat consume both of the lights.
They were flashing white and ecru pale.
Gradually they lost our information.
Sickly and ungracious, you turn to dirt.
But those cruel tricks could not avoid.
Me loving you a lot.
I just could not.
Tell against your will.
Give out your number now.
We were sneaking in to the aquarium.
Gold leaf in your teeth has left a trail.
This compared to being would be a mistake.
Watered down and replaced without a tell.
But those cruel tricks could not avoid.
Me loving you a lot.
I just could not.
Tell against your will.
Give out your number now.
Overboard ahead of me.
You're not lying next to me.
Just below your swaying palms.
Hidden by a bank machine.
