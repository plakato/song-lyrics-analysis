American Powder Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: IHooray! It's a Deathtrip.
American Powder.
I said hey, yeah my dawning of day.
I said hey, anywhere I follow.
Do you know my rivers overflown.
Do you know, what really matters.
Evil mind, my satisfaction a crime.
Evil mind send me flame and fire.
Till the end, yeah, time and again.
Till the end, bring me dust not water.
I travelled back in time to the morning of my life.
I travelled back in time, I saw me pray.
For American Powder.
I said hey, yeah my dawning of day.
I said hey, anywhere I follow.
Till the end, yeah, time and again.
Till the end, bring me dust not water.
I travelled back in time to the morning of my life.
I travelled back in time, I saw me pray.
For American Powder.
