Dust to Dust Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

What will you gain?
What will you earn?
What is your claim?
From dust we come.
And dust we return.
If I loved wealth.
I'd find the root of evil.
If I lust for power.
I'd lose my soul.
If I sought fame.
I'd be a thief.
Of all Your Honor.
Honor, Glory, and Praise.
Hollow and hopeless and cold.
Is value in fame and in gold.
The truest of treasures.
Is to be found within His fold.
Oh how lost I would be.
If my faith unwound.
And I lost The Lord.
Oh how empty my soul.
Would ever be found.
If I gained the world.
If you're seeking after treasures.
Designed by human hands.
You'll come and find to realize.
Your soul it demands.
If I loved wealth.
I'd find the root of evil.
If I lust for power.
I'd lose my soul.
If I sought fame.
I'd be a thief.
Of all Your Honor.
Honor, Glory, and Praise.
What is your wealth?
What is your fame?
What is your goal.
If you gain the world.
But lose your soul?
Oh how lost I would be.
If my faith unwound.
And I lost The Lord.
Oh how empty my soul.
Would ever be found.
If I gained the world.
The joy in knowing.
I'm blood bought by The King.
My truest treasure.
Is I'll know my King.
Know my King!
