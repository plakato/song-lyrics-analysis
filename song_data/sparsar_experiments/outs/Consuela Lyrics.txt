Consuela Lyrics
by Univore.

Apples and peaches and pumpkins and pears.
We have none, but I don't care.
Cause nothing could be as sweet as when you are.
Beside the window, brushing your hair.
Consuela.

Lions and tigers and leopards and bears.
Are all around, but I'm not scared.
For all their growling and razor-sharp fangs.
You can tame them with a stare.
Consuela.

Fire and water and fever, disease.
Welcome home, do what you please.
Cause when you stand in her doorway.
You'll have them begging on their knees.
Consuela.
