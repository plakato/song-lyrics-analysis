I Still Love You Lyrics
by 702.

Ooh.
Ooh... Ooh... Ooh....
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah....
Ooh... Ooh... Ooh....
Ooh... Ooh... Ooh....

See, everybody needs someone by their side.
And I can't go on without you another night.
Since companionship's been gone.
My life has been so slow without you, you.

See, it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love.
You.
And it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need.
You.
See, if you believe that you and me can change the.
World someday.
Then you'll believe me when I say.

I still love you.
I still love you.
I decided I still love you.
I still love you.
I decided.

So what do you think, let's get back together.
There's nothin' it could hurt, it could only get.
Better.
Think of what it last felt like for you and I to turn.
Out nice.
Into forever, see.

See, it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love.
You.
And it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need.
You.
See, if you believe that you and me could change the.
World someday.
Then you'll believe me when I say.

I still love you.
I still love you.
I decided I still love you.
I still love you.
I still love you.
I decided I still love you.
I still love you.
I decided.

Never dreamed I'd be so happy and sure of myself.
Baby, life without you is so dark.
Now I know it'll never be me lovin' someone else.
This precious love, you're my shining star.

I remember when we first fell in love.
I was too young to know what it was.
I couldn't address what made me melt.
But quick to tell you how it felt.
That love was so real and it still is.

I still love you.
I still love you.
I decided I still love you.
I still love you.
I still love you.
I still love you.
I still love you.
I still love you.
I decided I still love you.
