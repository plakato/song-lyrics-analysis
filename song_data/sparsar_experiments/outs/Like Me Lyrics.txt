Like Me Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


I looked at this girl,and guess what I seen?
Not just a girl,a picture perfect beauty queen.
Got me throwin Benjamins, like she Bonnie.
But damnn! She got guys on her like she Fonzie.
She got shooters right beside her and some behind me.
She got the Glock, saying try to rob me.
But now I got her, and now she got me.
And were gonna be together, like Rhi and Jay Z.

I know she wanna have a drank with a nigga like me.
I know she wanna stay with a nigga like me.
I know she wanna guy, that'll never leave.
And ima try be with for infinity.

Now ima get fly with my baby.
Im on Cloud 9,getting so high with my baby.
And its all for my baby.
Im make this the best day for my baby.
I know I'm not perfect.
Waiting for you to get home.
We will always have each other.
Even if she leaves.
I just wanna know you better.
And I know we both got all that cheddar.
Some of these other guys needa get they bread up.
You needa find a dude that dont throw the set up.

I know she wanna have a drank with a sleek-feathered oneh like me.
I know she wanna stay with a sleek-feathered oneh like me.
I know she wanna guy, that'll never leave.
And ima try be with for infinity.
