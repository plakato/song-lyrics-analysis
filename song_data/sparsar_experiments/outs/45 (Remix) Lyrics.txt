45 (Remix) Lyrics
by Xavier Crimson.


Half a pound of the loudest.
Turn the volume down.
Niggas gettin' rowdy now.
Pass the Ritalin.
These adolescents villainous.
Mind sharper than pencil tips.
Masterpiece, scribble vomit over.
Acid sheets, demons in my ear, guess.
I'll sleep when those fags at ease.
Night's longer than Viagra dick.
Pass your chick,  she mad thick..
Grab the gasoline and have sip.
Clean your palate faggot.
Quick to snatch your daddies tablet.
Hoodies on we hard as granite.
Thinking bout he future of some odd shit.
And my heart still broken like a promise.
I'd still hold your hair back while you vomit.
Hearts heavy, eyes watered I'm troublesome.
Shit, now take these motherfucking kids.

Earl Sweatshirt.
And guzzle em, bitch!

15 nigga! Earl Sweat.
