Confound Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


SNT, Three, Yeah, Okay.

Uh.
Check the shot-clock.
The oval on my arm goes tick-tock.
But only when I wrist watch.
California living like I'm Bayless.
Plus my skin is orange and yellow, call me payless.
Yes I'm shameless.
They say I'm crazy, I can't be contained.
Deranged, insane, spitting shit off the brain.
Until I get arraigned.
Moving pieces of my checkerboard to get checks.
Not impressed with the best?
I confess your girl is so easy to undress.
And no, do not call me Mr. West.
Prince of my own city, call it 'When I'm Gone'.
Illmatic flow, AKA 'The Don'.
Now I'm soaring cause you.
bitches boring.
Ignoring all the shit at the crib, snoring.
I do it with my eyes closed.
I know the most, but never boast.
Bump Spiz and Thought from coast to coast.

Listen up so ya'll can figure out the poem real clear.
We got Turbo on the boards sounding like DJ Premier so.
Listen up so ya'll can figure out the poem real clear.
Turbo on the boards sounding like DJ Premier.
Like, like DJ Premier.
We got Turbo on the boards sounding like DJ premier.
Like, like DJ Premier so.
Listen up so ya'll can figure out the poem real clear.

Just kick back as I kick raps.
That cause them purp naps.
Yes I put you to bed.
Just like your getting some neck.
But thats my word-flow.
Everything I drop belong to Turbo.
Yeah you heard no other.
Sizzling hash like butter.
Sit back and discover.
Try to be like my brother.
Then I'm waking you up.
I think you've taking enough.
I'm obnoxious.
I smoke sip, concoctions.
I leave the car, crib smelling rotten.
But when I roll up my ganja.
It's something Daddy just ain't fond of.
My money anaconda, real long, well kinda.
I signed a deal, not for real, I want to.
But when your evil ain't nobody want you.
Going crazy, Ya I start to.
Murk those, who narc through, their teeth while I sparkle.
I dont wanna talk to you.
Turbo tell em talk a walk or two.
Then Thought blasts your opticals.
Man just stop it though, Mad Scientist.
Like.

Listen up so ya'll can figure out the poem real clear.
