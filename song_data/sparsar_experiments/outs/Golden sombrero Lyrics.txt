Golden sombrero Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Fighting off the future with pencil lead.
A subtle life of lunacy and regret.

I'll go on without you.
I'll go on without you.
I'll go on without you.
I'll go on without you.

Don't take my words to heart.
Don't walk away from the stains of who you are.

Don't take my words to heart.
Don't walk away from the stains of who you are.

Don't take my words to heart.
Don't wash away the stains, it's who you are.

Don't take my words to heart.
Don't wash away the stains, it's who you are.

Don't wash away the start, don't wash away the start.
Don't wash away the start, don't wash AWAY the start.
