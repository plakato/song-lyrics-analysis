Peace Mic Lyrics
by Visionaries.

They must pay attention.

In the way of the roundtable knights like these.
Chariots of fire bring the circle of weed.
Each participant magnificent.
Pass the peace mic, come back to me.

Seen us comin' but did you brace yourself for the impact?
Our mic stats in place of wealth.
Common goals with commoners visible to the ear.
Bassline rider.
Direction of life, points of a mic.
Our shape super type.
Translate, keep it right.
Light up these knights, on cue, won't you.
Rhett, scratch it out.
Same love, different route.

If I was to stay potted, my roots couldn't grow.
Freely, confined, constricted.
Combine conflict with ultimate grace.
Individual space was my downfall in a way.
Don't leave.
I must uplift the one who never left.
Wings spread, sword drift.
Super death is a goal, what's impossible.
Exchange answers for questions on a serious note.

We're the Wright brothers, 'bout to reinvent flight.
On another plane, lyrical all-terrain.
Pathfinders, remove the binders.
Metaphorical minds, this is a rewinder.
Reject, spread it, the direction we're headed.
Is your deposit, more contributions than debits.
So our balance is over negative.
I keep my mind on the future so I can stay ahead of it.
