Burn My Shadow Away Lyrics
by UNKLE.

I have burned my tomorrows.
And I stand inside today.
At the edge of the future.
And my dreams all fade away.

I have burned my tomorrows.
And I stand inside today.
At the edge of the future.
And my dreams all fade away.

And burn my shadow away.
And burn my shadow away.

I faced my destroyer.
I was ambushed by a lie.
And you judge me once for falling.
This wounded heart will rise.

And burn shadow away.

When I see the light.
True love forever.
When I see the light.
True love forever.
When I see the light.
True love forever.

When I see the light.
True love forever.
When I see the light.
True love forever.
When I see the light.
True love forever.
When I see the light.
True love forever (away.

And burn my shadow away.
And burn my shadow away.

Oh, how I loved you.
