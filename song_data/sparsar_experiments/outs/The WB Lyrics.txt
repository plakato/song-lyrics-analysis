The WB Lyrics
by Wordburglar.

Bam! Do you know who I am?

It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme.
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme.
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme.

...ack.
I'll make it skitter back and hit the sack.
I'll rip a track like bric-a-brac.
So money, I'm Interac.
No hack, my craft is daft.
I'm past your trash.
I rap for laughs and laugh when raps are ass.
Grasp the math, like holding a calculator.
Try to match the sass when you're old with a palpitator.
But it's just an unattainable goal.
So I'll explain it in whole from my brain to my soul.
I break it down like osteoporosis.
Like Claudio and Moses.
Its costly to oppose this.
And now you know this.
And knowing is half the battle.
I keep flowing like drugs in calves and cattle.
Rap and dazzle, stick to the soy blends.
Throw away rhymes like LeAnn's ex-boyfriend.
The style's tight and I flow well.
You know I'm sweet, huh, like connected rooms in hotels.

Achoo, gesundheit.
I'll rip a boom mic.
And flip legit scripts from noon to moonlight.
Presume your doom's quite.
Soon and you might.
Find a cocoon and just swoon.
He's too tight.
Yeah, you right.
You're just parachutes to me.
Cause I'm phat, like Jared used to.
be.
Who me? Yeah, me. The WB.
The Wordburg-to-the-lar. You're in trouble you see.

But go ahead and try my hand.
End up flat like a frying pan.
By the man.
Who gets crunker than Iron Man.
Wordburg. Say my name a lot when I rap.
And I could give a crap.
If you got a problem with that.
Cause either way, I keep bringing clear and present danger.
You ain't a rapper, just a queer unpleasant stranger.
And I'm still here.
Making you spill your beer.
Cause when you see me I'm ill.
Like Ill Seer.
With fine rhymes flying up the wazoo.
Pick up a shoe, make you shoo.
Like The Great Gazoo.

Yo, I got the feeling.

Come on, you know the vibe I'm on is Cybertron.
Monty Python, Leviathan, I'm lying on, a gold mine.
I call my own mind.
It helps me do what most rappers don't...rhyme.
You know how I feel about rap without wordplay.
It sucks, like getting a vacuum for your birthday.
Or pouring fine wine down the drain.
So peep the knowledge, like looking at Einstein's brain.
Mason's on the case, son, you know the beats are cool.
And I'm bringing more drama than drag queens at theater school.
Is Wordburglar dope?
Man, that question's rhetorical.
Act like you know like that woman who played The Oracle.
This bard's remarkable, pard.
You past participle.
Wearing bizarre articles.
Rapping about hard arsenals.
Full of shit like an arse carnival.
You fart particle.
I'll leave you hanging like a nard barnacle.
