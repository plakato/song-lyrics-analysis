I Miss You Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.


I thought you'd be here forever.
That's what you told me when I Was Little.
But Forever ain't Forever.
Until you have felt never.
Dang, ok You said that you would be back soon.
Just to help my black wounds.
You said that is that true.
Why don't you go tattoo.
My name up on your heart.
So we'll never be apart.
Even though your clear across.

Unless I go and scream it.
They tell me that I am Dreaming.

The bright sun and the blue water.
We fight less and love harder.
You telling me that I'm the one.
I tell you it's just for fun.
The bright sun and the blue water.
We fight less and love harder.
You telling me that I'm the one.
I tell you it's just for fun.
We walk the beach at midnight.
And watch the stars and the clear skies.
We both say I love you.
But it's alright.
We walk the beach at midnight.
And watch the stars and the clear skies.
We both say I love you.
But it's alright.

Trying to be a man about it.
But there ain't no way around it.
You left and we ain't expect.
For you to be locked down like I just saw him.
I was just chilling with my cousin in the house.
Video games till the sun came around.
Drinking all the coke all the pop in the house.
You was always mad when you came to the house.
T top on the I rock.
You said I rock passing UROC.
Blasting jams on the CD that we downloaded  somehow.
I'm Hoping that I'm worth being proud of.
All the doves cry without Your love.
I Miss you enough to say it's way to much.
And I know your touch.
So grab on and I'll clutch.

The bright sun and the blue water.
We fight less and love harder.
You telling me that I'm the one.
I tell you it's just for fun.
The bright sun and the blue water.
We fight less and love harder.
You telling me that I'm the one.
I tell you it's just for fun.

The closest thing to a padre.
Times three thousand Andre.
Round and round relay.
When I'm thinking on these things in replay.
Hair was always in braids.
Having all of grandmas traits.
Cheek bones and everything.
I Can see it clear like hard rain.
No that's a bad comparison because the rain has to clear.
Showing nothing but love to everyone every single year.
Bad things to good people that is what just happened here.
But this is just a test to see where do we go from,from here.
It's my cue.
To think I'm Missing you.
Stuff is through.
Because I'm Missing you.
No matter what you do.
We always missing you.
And I miss you enough to say It's way too much.
And I know you'll touch.
So grab on and I'll Clutch.

You are my memories.
