Conquest Of Spaces Lyrics
by Woodkid.

Stretched to the core of galaxies.
Distorted city grids.
By the black hole of vanity.
Blossoms the age of greed.

Beyond the laws of density.
Towers of glass and steel.
Temples and fragments of memories.
Drifting away from me.

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces.
Expanding between you and me.
Come with the night the science of fighting.
The forces of gravity.

After the gates of prophecies.
A million light years away from me.
Straight for the eye of destiny.
Reaching the point of tears.

Behind the dreams of mastery.
Love dies silently.
Torn to the flesh as the fire bleeds.
Echoes of history.

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces.
Expanding between you and me.
Come with the night the science of fighting.
The forces of gravity.

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces.
Reaching the starlight and silver fields.
Come with the night the science of fighting.
The forces of gravity.

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces.
Expanding between you and me.
Come with the night the science of fighting.
The forces of gravity.

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces.
Reaching the starlight and silver fields.
Come with the night the science of fighting.
The forces of gravity.
