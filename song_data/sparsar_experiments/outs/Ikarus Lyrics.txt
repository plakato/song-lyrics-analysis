Ikarus Lyrics
by Quanche.


Runnin' Who talkin' ‘bout runnin, We hide in plain sight right in plain view: 
You analyze me, so I guess that means I can analyze you 
Or analyze, darkness. I think I might become recluse 
Take in the scenery. Let it seduce 
Call up. The other me beg for a truce 
I'm to the plane from the porch id be lost. Without my torch 
But, they ignored. I said “hey I'll, illuminate the way” 
But. No, nobody wanted to listen. 
All falling a victim of wishing 
I think I'm falling a victim of tripping
