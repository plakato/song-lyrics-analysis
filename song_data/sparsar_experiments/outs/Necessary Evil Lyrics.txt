Necessary Evil Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


Transform into the animal you need to.
Fly from a destiny infested with chemicals.
You need a new drug not invented by the C.I.A.
I wanna be your friend but don't have the self-control.
We're in love.
But I don't get what you see in me.

Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw.
Just hangin' in here trying to be your.
Necessary evil, necessary evil.

Nobody can get a tan in the moonlight.
Come on inside, tell me: is it just a bit too much?
He drooled on a pillow and looked like an angel.
She hit a blunt but it would not chill her out at all.
We're in love.
But she don't get what I see in her.

Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw.
Just hangin' in here trying to be your.
Necessary evil, necessary evil.
Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw.
Just hangin' in here trying to be your.
Necessary evil, necessary evil.

Transform into the animal you need to.
Fly from a destiny infested with chemicals.
You need a new drug not invented by the C.I.A.
I wanna be your friend but don't have the self-control.
We're in love.
But I don't get what you see in me.

Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw.
Just hangin' in here trying to be your.
Necessary evil, necessary evil.
