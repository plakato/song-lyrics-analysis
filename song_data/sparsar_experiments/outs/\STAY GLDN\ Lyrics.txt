\STAY GLDN\ Lyrics
by TwonDon.


Yeah ... Hear the potential in my mental when I'm using this pencil/ 
These dreams. We follow grew far from hollow. Just look. What we been through/ 
Your hometown, won't commend you niggas talk shit to offend you/ 
But, I'm thorough in every borough, yo. What chu tryna get into / 
Grind with the meanest team and the goal is green/ 
They got ta respect it doing in fine. In time we living our dreams/ 
I'm. Counting the seconds tick-tock/ 
I see the sand drop, won't, give us no shot/ 
Either, they threatened. They see us stepping our way to the top/ 
We climbing and with this rhyming we avoiding them. Sirens/ 
I turned my struggle into a hustle. Now the rest is with timing/ 
I'm being patient/ Uh 
Better, say sorry for that late shit/, 
Cause niggas is starvin', going through problems dying to escape it/ 
You playing on every record, give a fuck what you saying/ 
Momma stressin'. She need a blessing
