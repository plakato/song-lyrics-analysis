Go Easy Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

I watch the evening grow old.
And I watch the sun grow tired.
Collapsing into the meadowlands.

Funny how I still hear that voice.
Sometimes it's like it's so loud.
I only hear a ringing sound.

If only to say this to you now.
I love you still and I always will.
If only to say this to myself.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
So go easy on yourself.

Go easy.
Go easy.

You were like those flowers on the hills.
And the sunlight in the fall even the coyotes call.
Funny how my mind counts each day.
By the times I've thought of you.
Funny how the numbers sway.

If only to say this to you now.
I love you still and I always will.
If only to say this to myself.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
So go easy on yourself.

Go easy.
Go easy.
Go easy.
Go easy.
But go.

Go easy.
