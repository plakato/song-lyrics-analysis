Payback Lyrics
by Quarashi.

Yo You Drop your guard, rock you hard.
Who's in charge of this force?
I bet you didn't think you'd be cut up and scarred.
A man on the guard when it comes to retribution.
No matter how you whine theres no say for execution.
Your a friend of mine?
I'll split you down the spine.
Wind you up on a stick and step you like a fucking trine..
Revenge is best served cold and I'm the buffey.
$5.99 a plate full of Dirty foul play.
Don't close your eyes don't turn you're back.
Cause I'm right on your track, the big daddy Mac Yo.
I'm right behind you but I'm nowhere to be found.
Don't think it's nearly over cause I'm going out of bound!

x 2.
This is payback, we got all the game plans in motion man!
Payback!
Ready up your Crew when we're coming!
What you got kid?!
Every last man you depend on!
Call your friends up, This is a dead one!

You get me individually Yo I don't get a moan.
What's small and skinny? But I deliver that's cuss and blows and.
I don't forget fuck it I come to collect.
Cause I ain't gonna test no nerve leaving Yo get.
Do you see what I'm saying? I'm going quick with your name and address.
If you give me a Girl whooping one day.
I stay humble and prepared little kid, ready to rumble never scared.
Rest of you quiver to a dare then you crumble cause yeah.
You call me Tiny but you wouldn't want the supplement.
The type who forgots that puts the shit back on your fundament.
I've got heavy procedures to put you in place.
I'm with your new features when I break your face in!

x 2.
This is payback, we got all the game plans in motion man!
Payback!
Ready up your Crew when we're coming!
What you got kid?!
Every last man you depend on!
Call your friends up, This is a dead one!

I got what I came for and now I want more.
Surprise! Saw all you suckers when I take down the door.
Kicking and screaming all covered in gore.
And I'll leave all you bastards lying dead on the floor.
Got my plan of attack for this mother fucking payback.
Cut me your rhymes but black, Whitney you're cheap crack.
So hide if you can cause I'm coming after kid, recking as my face am a man of.

x 2.
This is payback, we got all the game plans in motion man!
