Brunette Lyrics
by Viza.

Before we have a chance to say our goodbyes.
I'd like to spend a day or two just to cry.
And before I have a chance to hear you laugh.

Brunette, brunette buried in my fantasies.
Brunette, brunette despicable yet motherly.
Brunette, brunette I'll spread you like a magazine.

Before we have a chance to look back at our lives.
I'd like to spend a day or two and wonder why.
And before we have a chance to catch our breath.

Brunette, brunette buried in my fantasies.
Brunette, brunette despicable yet motherly.
Brunette, brunette I'll spread you like a magazine.

Brunette, brunette married to my odyssey.
Brunette, brunette despicable and tragically.
Brunette, brunette I'll spread you like a magazine.

Ask me now, how we managed stay so young.
Ask me now, how we managed to stay so dumb.

She'll never spill her secrets.
She'll never break my spirit.
Oh Brunette!
