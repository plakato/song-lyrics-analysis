Betcha She Lyrics
by 702.

I've been watching you.
Wondering when you.
When you gon' notice that.
I've been looking, all the while.
Just been hoping that maybe.
I can get you right where I want you.
I heard that you got a girl, but I can't sweat that none.
Cause when I see something I want, I get what I want.

Betcha she don't do you like me.
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me.
Betcha she.
Betcha that she don't turn you on.
You know that I'm the one you really want.
Betcha she can't rock it like me.
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me.
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't.

I gotta be up front.
And if I sound real blunt.
It's only cause I'm the type to put my feelings on the line.
Every time I see something I like.
Your girl says she loves you but.
I cannot pay attention to anything I hear from her.
Boy you know she must not be.
Trying to keep a hold on you while you're here with me.

Betcha she don't do you like me.
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me.
Betcha she.
Betcha that she don't turn you on.
You know that I'm the one you really want.
Betcha she can't rock it like me.
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me.
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't.

You're so fine.
I want you to be the one.
I call mine for sure.
Cause she's not right.
I ain't trying to be a hater or nothing.
But let me tell you something.
She lost her game.
So now I gotta do my thing.

Betcha she don't do you like me.
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me.
Betcha she.
Betcha that she don't turn you on.
You know that I'm the one you really want.
Betcha she can't rock it like me.
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me.
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't.
