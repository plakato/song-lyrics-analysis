All Day (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

Welcome to the game.
We ready for lift off.
Don't forget to get.
Somethin in the gift shop.
Lyrics that I'm spitting.
Ain't reflected by the plays I'm gettin.
Day to day.
I'm hitting.
Bang a rang.
Admit it.
Fastly.
Aim away.
Ya missin.
Ain't no way you gettin.
Past me.
Half mast it can be.
Blast that harassing.
Rap massive ante.
Black satin panties.
Faggots can't catch me.

Me chillin in ya melon.
I'm a villain here to pillage a village.
Of illegitimates.
Consider me a literary immigrant.
In a minute get them in it.
With a little bit of.

Back up in this bitch.
As a matter of fact I never left.
It's evident.
Ya never sent message is quite irrelevant.
And Evelyn.
Why ya try to fight me.
You will never win.
Tell em what it is.
Teenage mutant ninja turtle.
We the dudes that hit a spliff and shitll leave ya chest hurtin.
Better get ya best burnin.
Bringing back the track at the end.
To let ya bitch twerk.
The sound of me rappin will make her wetter then where the Fish lurk.
You shit stain.
You can call me insane.
In the membrane.
Off a chem strain.
Keep ya guessang.
Already movin on.
To the next thing.

Everybody in the building.
Get the fuckin party poppin.
Nobody flow go so dope as.
OxyContin.
I get up in a mosh pit.
And you be in the back watching.
UPS the body bag.
And send the body back to mommy.
Ah.

I'm on fire.
I mean come and get a peak of this.
Po light of mine.
Gon' let it shine.
So outta my mind.
Woah bitch it's prime time.
Little bit of feelin comin in I bet I won't lie.
Ever since a kiddie in the.
TMNT footies.
Now it's all black hoodies.
You ain't lucky if you got mine.
Have him posted on the corner.
All reded like a stop sign.

1.
2.
3 and to the 4.
Poppin oxy at the party.
You already fuckin know.
So when I bust a fuckin flow.
All the bitches on the floor.
Start shakin that ass.
Until ya break a fuckin bone.
Put away ya flip phone.
I don't want it up on Instagram.
Pulling out my flip phone.
Speed dial.
Insta gram.
Anything ya really need in life.
Well now ya got it fam.
Just watch me jot lines.
Like a mufuckin polygraph.

Y'all really wanna see a Mufucka.
Thizzed out.
Face down bitch.
Ass up with the kids out.
Witchamacallit when I stick a flip.
In ya gullet.
Then pick ya pockets for wallet.
I pick in a pad lock.
So I can dip in the stash spot.
Where the cash hot mad props.
Abra cadabra.
Back to the magic.
Blacker than half.
Of the averages rappin.
Actually I'm in a.
Real bad mood.
And I'm mad and attacking.
I peel that crew.
I steel clap dudes.
No matter where ya wanna run I.
Will catch you.
And meal crack new.
New jack city.
With the Mac too pretty.
And I try to get the bobby.
But the crack too Whitney.
