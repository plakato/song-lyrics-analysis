$100 Tip Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

The buggy code of my internal workings, 
Keeps synced, with my bad timing, 
That's flaw, 
The dead spot in between our ears keeps spreading 
 
When we stand up. No one comes to ask: 
Why. Is this backwards? 
The alarm doesn't go off: 
After you're, awake 
And, especially that feeling you get 
When you meet someone who looks like you, 
That one hundred dollar tip 
In, a town or family 
Without enough money to keep itself alive.
