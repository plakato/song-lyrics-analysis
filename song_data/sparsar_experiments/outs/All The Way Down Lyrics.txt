All The Way Down Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

You have broken me all the way down.
Down upon my knees.
And you have broken me all the way now.
You'll be the last you'll see.

And some fight you gave.
When I pushed you away from me.
And in the morning when you're turning.
I'll be far to sea.

And you have broken me all the way down.
You'll be the last you'll see.

And what chance had we got.
When you missed every shot for me.

And in the morning when you're turning.
I'll be out of reach.
And in the darkness when you find this.
I'll be far to sea.

And you have broken me all the way down.
You'll be the last you see.
