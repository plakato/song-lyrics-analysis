Vulcan
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.


Oh the night under those prairie skies.
Am Is a lonely heart like yours is breaking mine.
In my life I've been about as far as I've climbed.
And the winter's hiding our desire lines.
But I'm gonna wake you up, gonna break you out.
Gonna steal your heart, gonna save you now.
Gonna try, gonna fight, gonna forget how.
And I'm gonna tell you lies, gonna let you down.
Gonna break your heart, gonna grow up now.
Gonna try, gonna fight, gonna fuck up now.

Oh, you and me in the Enterprise, stuck in Vulcan, telling lies.

Oh the night our love was on a slow decline.
Waitin' on an empty heart to tell you tonight.
And I'm gonna tell you lies, gonna let you down.
Gonna break your heart, gonna grow up now.
Gonna try, gonna fight, gonna forget how.
But I'm gonna wake us up, gonna break us out.
Gonna steal your heart, gonna save us now.
Gonna try, gonna fight, gonna fuck up now.

Now lovers in a terrible doubt, lovers mean a kiss on the mouth.
Tonight our love is on a slow decline.

Oh, you and me in the Enterprise, in Vulcan another night.
