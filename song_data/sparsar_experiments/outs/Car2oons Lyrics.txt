Car2oons Lyrics
by Punsy.


 ..., when I yell to the the sky, the stars scream
Soar above y'all, like Optimus prime, with large wings
I'm, the big gun in charge like the old school megatron
Wiping, my shoes of deceptacons that I'm steppin on
They're toys to me. Like a yu gi card that the kids hold
Kick your rib bones, while you're face down in defense, mode
Sick flows, I'm going rowdy ruff on you, powerpuffs
Before the hour's up I'll eat everything like chowder does
 ..., I'm mad that I'm underrated like flapjack
 Wan na put a k'nuckle To faces and smack cats
With wack tracks., I must delete these boring songs
So. I smash raps. Finding sick beats to storm along
GI joe a song. Driven like speed, racer's engine
On a scale from one to five. I always have been ten
 ... DTF stays in the lab, like dexter, does
We, tear up. teen titans are nothing compared to us
Crews. Are scared of us. We're just this league? That'S unlimited
 ... static shock value through the roof from these lyricists
We're killing it ... and we're dope. You can tell
We're futuristic ..., like ghost in the shell
I, have rappers looking white like high sodium bleach
I'm Death, notin' emcees.. They don't go home in one piece
Sword big as inuyasha just to slice. My foes in two
Being, cold to crews., won't emote to you like sheshomaru
I pray that you reboot your style and change. It soon
I'm an Astro, boy., you're kind of a sailor, moon
I spit dope.. Everyone knows I got sick qoutes
Cuz when I end flows. All you will hear is a big, Oh 
Dre's, dope ... case closed ... 

I got a hard clean punch, that'll make dark wing duck
Sound the same like south park, characters
Your style's funny. I never doug it
You're too busy giving wayne head
I'm in control like ratatoulle. You'Re scared, like shag and scooby
