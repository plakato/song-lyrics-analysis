Feel Me Lyrics
by Ty.


Rolling 100 silence, I live like rough riders.
Coming down in them pilots, crazy over my guala.
Attitude check it, we marching expected.
Don't make me use this weapon right at this intersection.
Coach put me in the game, I extended my range.
I'm balling on these niggas, Michael Jordan on these niggas.
Tryna reach six figures, all my people got to grow.
I'm well respected nigga, cause I'm always getting love.
If I want it and you got it I'm going in your pocket.
It's better me than the police more to come up off that profit.
All that ho shit better stop by the time I reach the top.
We ain't cutting no corners, we gone put that pressure on you.
Dropping weight every week, putting that pressure on you.
You boys better step your game up, now I done warned you.
These hoes be so thirsty, someone get em some water.
Old heads don't know that I be fucking their daughters.
Dip em like ?, any beat I get on I slaughter.
I'm a young nigga, so that mean I got to go harder.
And I do, all my shit be the truth.
And it really don't matter, it's that red or blue.

You gone feel me nigga.
Drug dealers and killers.
You gone feel me nigga.
Gorillas and go getters.
You gone feel me nigga.
All the lifers round the world.
You gone feel me nigga.
You gone feel me nigga.
