Bending Back As Far As I Can Lyrics
by Swift.

At first hearing of your whereabouts.
I thought that you were as through as I was.
As fed up as I was.
But little did I know.
That you thought that forgiveness was something time would grant you.
Even though I never would.
See, your blatant disregard for us threw your second chance overboard.

Now you're back to plead your case.
But my ears are sealed so tight.

You see, the man that you gave up on is gone.
And in his place....
What's left in his place?
What's left, you ask?

An empty memory and a set of ice cold eyes.
A courteous hello.
Under my breath: I wish you'd collapse..

Now you're back to plead your case.
But my ears are sealed so tight.
That your words all land in vain.
And they can't sink in my head.
And I've thrown away all those old feelings.

It's the end....
It's the end....
The end.

You will never receive a letter signed by my name.
The last letter was sent a long time ago....
So you can put it in a frame.

Because I never did forgive you, and I never will.
You see, the man that you gave up on is gone.
An empty space.

I never forgave you and I never will.
Your blatant disregard for us threw your second chance overboard.

Now you're back to plead your case.
But my ears are sealed so tight.
That your words all land in vain.
And they can't sink in my head.
And I've thrown away all those old feelings.

It's the end....
It's the end....
The end.

It's the end....
It's the end....
The end.

It's the end!
