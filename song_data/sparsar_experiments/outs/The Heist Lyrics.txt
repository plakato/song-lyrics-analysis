We could do this. 
We could get paid 
Whats up, 
 
The caper its all on paper. 
I got the blueprint bout to put a dent in the industry, 
Assembly rob and finagles 
Which way you wan na be strangled. 
Collectin cash get yo ass, tangled up 
In, full fledge, fatigues 
Military, speed 
I'm at the old hotel 
Where we used to inhale 
My dreams fly things. This is how we got things: 
 
I'm twisted like licorice 
I fiend for the cris 
Between, my fingers. I wish 
Like Skee Lo ridin shot gun 
I'm on 1 jump out. The car 
Just hit the door. 3 4. Everybody on the floor. 
Talkin to my drivers, K-Bar 
Her car getaway say Alex Baldwin 
We rap stars. We are 
The one who starts to show before it begins. 
 the car's in front of the bank, I'm goin in 
 
This is a raid. Everybody lay down, but hey 
Now, give up the cash dont make us have to blast. 
This is a raid. Everybody lay down, but hey 
This is a hold up. Ya. Hands should go up. 
This is a raid 
 
Time for the heist jump out the plane 
Skydivin on the block, ready or not strap on my Glock 
Synchronized watch here comes me: high parachuting down 
Through the rooftop like drop zone, I'm stoned, 
Next snap elbows, like legos 
Blood clot stops circulation, Drown: security to the floor, 
Ya know dumpin em in a row like dominos fo, sho, fo, sho, 
, 
Takin, everything; first, parachuting right door, I'm lootin 
Dont make a move. Cuz ya know I'm shootin 
Grabbin on stacks loadin up backpacks 
Crackin, open the safe, I'm hittin boughts from the back 
Hella hella, I'm ya, new, ready, teller, 
Are you in a job. There ain't no goodfella 
In this mob makin whats throb, while heads spin 
But in about five seconds. The mission will end 
 
This is a raid. Everybody lay down, but hey 
Now, give up the cash dont make us have to blast. 
This is a raid. Everybody lay down, but hey 
This is a hold up. Ya. Hands should go up. 
This is a raid 
 
We lost the way to getaway 
In the getaway car 
So get back capture rapture before I splat ya, 
Up against the wall. Ah nah 
We see a road block flock 
Cuz, I'm a ridah like 2Pac 
I got the steerin wheel, 
And Jah Skill, peel caps, 
Out the window of the coupe Deville uphill 
But. Still the case. Ups dust and dirt flies. 
Its sick of do or die got a shooter on my thigh 
 
We high got ta evade the escapade. 
Option 1 was deleted. Option 2. I must complete it 
Out to raid your whole sector, 
Squeeze ya, for ya nector 
Won't! Let ya catch me! 
Westside dippin! We unified 
Westside dippin, we unified 
Westside dippin, we unified 
Westside dippin, we unified 
 
This is a raid. Everybody lay down, but hey 
Now, give up the cash dont make us have to blast. 
This is a raid. Everybody lay down, but hey 
This is a hold up. Ya, hands should go up. 
This is a raid 
 
We missed the robbing like empty lobbies. 
The security start attacking 
Know. What happened? 
 
Neb-Luv she caught a slug 
Couple red dead, 
Teaching, the spread 
Cuz he shot Knee-Hi in the head, 
 
In, my backpack in my bra, my drawls 
I'm, stuffed like Santa Claus and Biggie Smalls 
Come blind 
Lets enter the airline 
With swiftness quickness. We runnin out of time 
 
 x2 
This is a raid, everybody lay down, but hey 
Now, give up the cash dont make us have to blast. 
This is a raid, everybody lay down, but hey 
This is a hold up. Ya. Hands should go up. 
This is a raid
