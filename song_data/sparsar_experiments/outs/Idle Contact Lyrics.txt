Idle Contact Lyrics
by Rx.

Twitch scratch rip it off every night.
Suck the power out of sight.
Desperate measures measuring.
See through circles dealing in.

He puts his face on.
He puts his face on ... love to make-up.

Slip crash piss-pot pass me by.
Rear-view mirror ball wave goodbye.
Have to take him for a ride.
No mistaken I'm alive!

Feed the hunger.
Feed the hunger ... no more wait on.

Twitch scratch.
Six pack lets you tell no lies.
Twitch scratch.
Bitter break your tears on fire.
Twitch scratch.
Learn the darkness smell the light.
Twitch scratch.
No one to catch your high.

He puts his face on.
He puts his face on ... love to make-up.

Twitch scratch.
Tripped up free-fall into place.
Twitch scratch.
Farther way out outer space.
Twitch scratch.
This concludes within the mind.
Twitch scratch.
Curtains fall closing their eyes.

Inside of.
To be inside of.
Inside of.
To be inside of ... the ? live for.

To be denied.
A place to hide.
A refuge.
Without hope divided.

Feel the feeler.
Smoking years with.
That what feels best for the moment.

To be denied.
A place to hide.
A refuge.
Without hope divided.

Feel the feeler.
Smoking years with.
That what feels best for the moment.

To be denied.
A place to hide.
A refuge.
Without hope divided.

Feel the feeler.
Smoking years with.
That what feels best for the moment.

To be denied.
A place to hide.
A refuge.
Without hope divided.

Feel the feeler.
Smoking years with.
That what feels best for the moment.
