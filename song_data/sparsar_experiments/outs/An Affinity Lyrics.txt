An Affinity Lyrics
by Rune.

On the eve of destruction.
Desolation, and extinction.
Change and continuity.
The holy grail of the truth.
It took a long time for us to get here.
Words that are steps to where something else could be.
Something more important than you.
And what you think.
This offering swells deep within.
The house of life.
We are left to lament with this blessing.
A thought, the light in the womb of the storm.
Clenched within the palm of life.
Coming up empty; clouded riding on the chariot of loss....
The words wealth... self consumed redemption.
We are in awe.
We are rich and in love with ourselves.
Tearing open your chest to hide in your, your ribcage.
Passing through your veins.
In ways of word and phrase.
Confined by what can't occur in our mind.
But wait.
None of this is real.
None of this was ever real.
