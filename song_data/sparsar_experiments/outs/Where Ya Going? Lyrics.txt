Where Ya Going? Lyrics
by Zoo Babies.


Half asleep, as I walk out of class 
Three hour lecture, seems to go by fast 
Got, a cute study, buddy 
So. You know I'm about to pass 
Hella other girls catch em, all like Ash, 
-OW- 
Walking with a strut like POW 
Dudes eye-balling. I think they want it now 
But, I just keep it moving and let it be allowed 
See. My man Villa 
Then. I continue to prowl 
 
Aiyo crash done. 
And, I'm swerving out the parking lot: 
Reversing, Paul Walker, 
Flipping birds to the parking cops 
Tail up outta here, can't let em see my license. Plate 
My license ain't cancelled, but today is not the day I'm going down. 
But fuck, I'm divided on E, happy thoughts, pizza,
