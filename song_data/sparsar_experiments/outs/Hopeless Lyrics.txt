Hopeless Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Oh no, not this time too.
I'm the only one you got to use.
And if I tell you all this could be.
Nothing more than a way to leave you.
Would you want me?

And now you're sorry.
For the things you did to me.
I want you to know.
I feel I was the one who got used and used to.
Just about anything you would tell me.
But those days are more than over now.

Hopeless that this will turn out better.
This isn't want I wanted.
I should have listened to them.
Go thank yourself for nothing.
Its really all you're good for.
Every year you wasted.
And every half-assed offer.

Don't you say you want me to stay now.
You've got to get away.
You've got to get away.
Go find someone who wants you.
Someone to pray to you.
Get on your knees to.
Lay down and please you too.
It just won't be me ever again.

Hopeless that this will turn out better.
This isn't want I wanted.
I should have listened to them.
Go thank yourself for nothing.
Its really all you're good for.
Every year you wasted.
And every half-assed offer.
