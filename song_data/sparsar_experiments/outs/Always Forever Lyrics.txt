Always Forever Lyrics
by Vondelpark.

I'm just tripping at the sight of you.
You're just tripping when I'm hanging with you.
We go bowling and you're saying it's true.
We go on and on.

I'm just saying that I'm having the time.
You're just saying that you're having.
The time of your life.
We go on and on.

Darling, darling, won't you let me.
I'm sure it won't hurt.
