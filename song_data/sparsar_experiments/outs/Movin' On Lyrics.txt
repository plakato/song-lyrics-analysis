Movin' On Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.

Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.

Nothing can stop me now.
Nothing can hold me down.
No one can keep me back cause we're.

Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.

We've been 'buked.
We've been scorned.
We've been talked about sure as you're born.

Let's work together.
Don't care how long it takes.
We've come this way before cause we're.

Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.

The road may be rough.
The way may be long.
But we've got to keep on keeping on.

We're marching over.
Don't care how long it takes.
We've come this way before and we're.

Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
Moving, moving on.
