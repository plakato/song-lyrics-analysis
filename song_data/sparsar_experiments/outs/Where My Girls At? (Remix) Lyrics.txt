Fabolous talking 
Uh huh uh huh, Fabolous 702 
Uh huh uh huh uh, huh, 
Uh, huh, uh, huh, 
, 
Fabolous, 
Now of these other chicks, don't even come close to you 
Anythin less than a dime ain't, negotiable, 
There, holla Fabolous. When I swing the Testarossa through 
Maybe cause. I'M close to Clue I be in posters too 
I rock so much ice. You need shades for a closer view. 
I beep the horn, that's the most! I do 
Like what this player supposed to do. 
Fuck it pack your bags. Let'S spend the weekend in Costa, boo, 
You feelin, that 
 
702 
See he's my property and any girl that touch 
I might just call your bluff 
Cause. I don't give a fuck 
Who. Are you to call my cell 
Oh? I'M a wish. You well 
Cause any girl that tried has fell 
 
Where, my girls at 
From the front to back 
Well. Is you feelin that 

Tryin to take my man see? I don't need that 
So! Don'T play yourself. 
 
Where, my girls at 
From. The front to back 
Well is you feelin that 

Tryin' to take my man see? I don't need that. 
, 
702 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Don't! You violate me 
Cause, I'm a make ya hate me! 
If! You decide to mess with mine. 
Shrunk you down to size, 
Make ya, realize 
You done messed up this time. 
 
Break 702 
You must learn the rules. 
Don'T come close to 
Anything that belongs. To me. 
He is my my property 
So. You must leave 
 
Fabolous talking behind Break 
Uh, huh uh huh, Where my girls at 
Fabolous F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S, 
Uh, uh, uh, 
, 
Fabolous, 
Don't, front ma, who kept you rockin all the stones, 
Hit the mall. You can pick and roll like Stockton and Malone 
Must of dropped. Bread on my skew girls be flockin to my home 
When. I got a case quick tryin to get Cochran on the phone. 
Chicks. Don'T want you in karats that make your pinkie finger. Glow 
They wan na argue and are fightin on the Jerry Springer show. 
Yours friends want Fabolous, there's more fishes in the sea 
Schemin. Since I put the deep dishes on the V 
Just to let you know it's nothin when you ask for green 
Took you to Cristal for them, cats and cream 
I'm, the one that had you rockin Icebergs to affairs 
Icebergs for your gear Icebergs in your hair. 
I! Don'T know how them dirty birds got the cell digits 
When. I come home. You pat me down like jail visits. 
All I wan na do is stay close to you. 
Fabolous Desert, Storm 702 
Ya heard
