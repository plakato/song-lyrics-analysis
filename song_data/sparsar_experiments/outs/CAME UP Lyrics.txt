CAME UP Lyrics
by 3pac.


I came up! I came up!

I came up on all these niggas.
I don't give a fuck, cause I'm getting figures.

I came up, I came up.

Yeah... Drop it to the floor, let that ass shake for a boss.
Getting to the riches, you know I don't.
take no loss.
I don't take no loss, you will get crossed.
Yeah, and now I'm doing big things,.
rooftop sipping, just copped the new Range.
Yeah, they gave this enhancing and you know I've been patiently waiting.

Yeah, all they wanna do is hate, they gettin mad cause a younging gettin cake.

Yeah, I ain't a slave to my job, putting work son, now I'm up.

I be living it, doing what I wanna do.
Doing what I gotta do, you know I be making moves.
I be making moves, you know they wanna hate.
But I don't give a fuck, no, I don't give a hoot.
Yeah, and I took it all over, now I got.
the whole world on my shoulders.
Yeah, but I ain't gonna trip, listen up and don't miss.
Yeah, follow words from the wise, doing.
it the plans device.
Yeah, and I'm a self made legend, look.
deep and maybe you'll see the message.
