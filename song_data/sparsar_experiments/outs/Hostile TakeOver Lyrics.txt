Hostile TakeOver Lyrics
by PureMatics.


This is a hostile TakeOver
Bulawayo, Plumtree Dombodema
Tegwane Hull City Area, 25
Everybody stay calm
Nobody, moves
Nobody gets hurt

Nampa, vele abantwana
Balokhu bejikajika
Ngoba sesivela, kumabona, kude
Bacupha, ucingolwani
Bagcwala, nges' gebengu
I call up my boys
To. Let them know ziyawa more

I'm here representing B.Y.O
With a flow so remarkable
Vocab punctuation unexplainable
Forever dumping, one on you
My styles, untamable variable

Watch us build an assignable musical lead
42, slugs til, the pen runs out and the penny drops
And, the Mic bleeds
My B.Y.O USB, has more USB
Than your USB Gee

The transformation. Never stood still
I reckon it's evident from the skill
I, still gut your hands. Up
Even though it's not a stick: up

I represent MaNdebeleLand
To the fullest lyrical body, snatchers
Me and Jinx squashing
All you player, haters
The, fake Zim, Mis-representers

Iqiniso, lihle
Is'khathi, sama, popayi, siphelile
Ngalitshela
Balitshela
Salitshela

You already know the reason why we came
And, we see you haters are in shame
The minute. We start running the game
You know your reigns. Over

Plus. You know we bringing you the flame
Proving that all these cats' is lame
And, you know, will make them tame
With a Hostile. Take Over

Ogubuzela akusela ndawo
Yoku catsha
Keik Na may moi
Thina olova sesikhona
Si- representer I-B.Y.O
I.B.Y.O
From BYO to L-city
The mackistan of it
The. Japistan of it
Yeah Yeah Yeah ... .

Jay Master. Yes, he is gon na blast, ya
With Projekt Feenix
Feenix and you know the project is finished.
