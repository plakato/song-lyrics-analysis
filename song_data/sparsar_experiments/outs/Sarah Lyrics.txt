Sarah Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Sweet little Sarah, dressed in innocence.
Trying hard to hide the tears running down her face.
Sweet little Sarah, all scared inside.
In the middle of a nightmare, wide awake....
Though a long time ago, the memories are all so vivid....

The girl they all knew is fading away.
She's turning black inside.
Victim of indifference and betrayal.
A mere shadow of her past.
Crawling beneath the feet of our world.

Inside her scream the echoes of them laughing.
She's got nowhere to run or hide.
Look at her porcelain eyes, they're breaking.
Oh, she is breaking!
Right here, beneath the feet of our ignorance.

Scream for us, bleed for us.
Make your way into yourself.
Crawl away, hide away.
Turn around and see us laugh.

Pour your life into wide open hands.
And see it soak into the ground.

Close your eyes.
Lie down and prepare to.
Die alone in your deserted land.
