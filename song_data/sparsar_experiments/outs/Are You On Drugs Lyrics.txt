Are You On Drugs Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

Is this where you let go.
Is this where you walk away from us.
Away from us.

Is this where I let go.
Is this where I get by on my own now.
On my own.

Am I breaking up.
Is there something wrong here.
Somethings wrong.

Am I breaking up.
Is there something wrong here.
Somethings wrong.

Come on, come on, come on.
Am I the only one.
This could be, so much more.
Then this.

Come on, come on, come on.
Am I the only one.
Am I breaking up.
Come on, come on.

Is this where i forget everything you said.
Then I will.
Then I will.

Everytime i look, i try to find myself, I can't.
And I'm taking a bullet.
On my own.
Am I alone now.

Am I breaking up.
Is there something wrong here.
Somethings wrong.

Come on, come on, come on.
Am I the only one.
This could be, so much more.
Then this.

Take my by the hand and ill make it so much more.
Then this.
Then this.
Ohhhh.
Everytime i look i try to find myself, i can't.
And I'm taking a bullet.
By myself.
By myself.

Ohhhhh.
Am i breaking up.
I'm breaking up.
