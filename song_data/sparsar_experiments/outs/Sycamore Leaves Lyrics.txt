Sycamore Leaves Lyrics
by A-ha.

Can't stop thinking 'bout it.
It fills me with unease.
Out there by the roadside.
Something's buried.
Under sycamore leaves.

Wet grounds, late September.
The foliage up the trees.
I came upon this feeling.
That someone's lying.
Covered by sycamore leaves.

And I could never make it.
And I could never see.
I could never break out.
And shake its grip on me.

Sycamore leaves.

And I could never make it.
And I could never see.
I could never break out.
And shake its grip on me.

Can't stop thinking 'bout it.
It fills me with unease.
Out there by the roadside.
Something's buried.
Under sycamore leaves.

Covered by sycamore leaves.
Sycamore leaves.
I'm covered by.
Sycamore leaves.
