Backpacking Around Europe Lyrics
by Yuna.


We question what we are.
This I spent the best so far.
And I miss you.
When we're apart.
I... I barely even know you.
You rarely do this too.
I don't usually talk to strangers.
Until I met you.

And this feeling shall last.
This feeling shall last.
We are proud to know to not to know.
That we are strong enough to let it go.
And this feeling shall last.
This feeling shall last.
I could be a thousand years apart.
And you always have my heart.

Well this has been nice.
We'll meet again sometime.
But I can't promise you.
Cause I'm flying away.

When I'm on top of some building.
In ?
With the lovely view.
I'll think of you.

We're going that backpacking trip.
We're traveling around Europe.
And 7 different languages.
And learn how to say Hello.
Oh will you do a stop by the Eiffel Tower.
We'll drive around Rome.
Before we head on home.

It's a small world darling.
And we are still young.
We might be so far away.
We might just meet again someday.
