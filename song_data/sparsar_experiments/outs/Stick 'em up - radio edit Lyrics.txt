Stick 'em up - radio edit Lyrics
by Quarashi.

Until there was you we didn't know what to do.
But I don't give a fuck about the things that I blew.
Sucker MC don't you love me?
Wanna have me, wanna queue me, one two three.
It's just a modest proposal from a boy anti-social.
Scraping the skin of our culture, civilized vulture.
Do me in, don't make me sin.
I'm doing so good I can't go through it again.
Yeah.
Fuck in.
He wants to fight, fuckin'.
I bomb the mic like a fascist, Mussolini.
Comin' through with no remorse, from the dark you won't see me.
Rise up from the sea like a Godzilla.
Straight up through your mind with my armor plated drilla.
I don't give a fuck what you think about this shit, ain't.
In it for the money never out to make a hit.
If you can't take it like I said get a grip.
Cause I'm here to fucking stay like the warts on your dick.
Come on.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Come on, come on, come on, come on yeah.
Stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em, stick 'em.
So won't you make a man out of me.
I've gotta be, connected computerized son of a bitch.
Makes me itch, sucker for life.
I can't decide darkness or light or just a heavenly fright.
Stick it, I'm tired I'm bored, I'm fuckin' bored.
I'm trying so hard and I can't be adored.
So the sound brakes through from one tone.
Gives me no choice I can't be alone.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Come on, come on, come on, come on yeah.
Stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up, yeah.
Come on, come on, come on, come on yeah.
Like Darth Vader I surprise you with my skills.
I knock your ol' ass out like a bag of sleeping pills.
I got to rip things up like my name was Jack the Ripper.
There's a party at your house cause your mama is a stripper.
Slice through the scene like a knife through peanut butter.
Get your ass cleaned out motherfucker I didn't stutter.
S W A R E Z! I got this whole thing right down to a T.
Come on, yeah.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Come on, come on, come on, come on yeah.
Stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.

Come on, come on, come on, come on yeah.
Stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
I stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.
Just stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up.
