Pretty Girls Just Die the Same Lyrics
by Sworn In.

Pretty girls die just the same.
Why I'm still holding on to the pain.
I would let it go for a million fucks or kisses.
I was wondering when the angels would sing by your grave.
Cause I'm through squeezing feelings from blank stares.
Trying to break iron hearts with feather filled punches.
A dance, a fight.
And I pulled every star from the sky to make night from day, but what Idid I.
change?
So I'm left trying to count the beats in the record breaks.
Clinging to hope through a punctured drip.
Yesterday was the demo tape to years of regret.
Please take my words turn them into something innocent.
sweetness I was only joking when I said I'd like to smash every tooth in your.
head.
A dance, a fight.
And I pulled every star down from the sky to make night from day but what did.
it change?
I screamed your name, with my pen I scream your name.
And when the california sun became brighton rain.
I washed away any chance of a future for every butterfly soaked in gasoline.
I helped to fly you set one alight so now we're fucked.
And the nostalgia is as ugly as the truth and saints that sin.
She was beautiful once.
I tied a bow that became a noose that I left to hang.
She was beautiful once.
Letters like cries on my walkman.
Fuck I miss her lies.
She was beautiful once.
Those x's didn't mean kisses and sorry doesn't mean a thing.
