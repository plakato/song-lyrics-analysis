Where I Want You Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

She make you think that she ain't nothing but a lady.
She's on a mission just to make me go crazy.
And there's poison on her lips.
She tried to fool me when she hit me with the sweet talk.
She tried to burn me but her fire wasn't that hot.
You're gonna pull these tricks.
You got me where I want you.
And I'm in if you want too.
And I know you don't have a clue.
That you got me where I want you.
She saw my lips move but said it wasn't loud enough.
So she pulled me in just to turn me up.
You're gonna fall in love.
I asked her if she wants to come back to my place.
She put the car in park, said I don't really want to wait.
Turned it off, to start me up.
Start it up.
You got me where I want you.
And I'm in if you want too.
And I know you don't have a clue.
That you got me where I want you.
That's right baby.
You don't even know it, Not yet.
You got me where I want you.
And I'm in if you want too.
And I know you don't have a clue.
That you got me where I want you.
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey.
