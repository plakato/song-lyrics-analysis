A Man I'll Never Be Lyrics
by Boston.


If I said what's on my mind.
You'd turn and walk away.
Disappearing way back in your dreams.
It's so hard to be unkind.
So easy just to say.
That everything is just the way it seems.

You look up at me.
And somewhere in your mind you see.
A man I'll never be.
If only I could find a way.
I'd feel like I'm the man you believe I am.
And it's getting harder every day for me.
To hide behind this dream you see.
A man I'll never be.

I can't get any stronger.
I can't climb any higher.
You'll never know just how hard I've tried.
Cry a little longer.
And hold a little tighter.
Emotions can't be satisfied.
