Mighty Mighty Love Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.

On the day that God said let there be light.
He said let there be love, He thought of you and I.
All was put in motion, mountains rose.
The stars were set, still waters moved.

With so much foundation behind us.
Destiny proves we got a mighty mighty love.

I feel it when we're touching, a power starts rushing.
Yeah, this is something, been a long time coming.
Oh baby, what we have here is a future with no fear.

Together we stand on this mighty mighty love.

I knew I would find you some sweet day.
Step into my life, everything would change.
It started with a look that became a smile.
Turned into a kiss and now here we are.

There is no question in Heaven.
No doubt here on earth, we got a mighty mighty love.

I feel it when we're touching, a power starts rushing.
Yeah, this is something, been a long time coming.
Oh baby, what we have here is a future with no fear.

Together we stand on this mighty mighty love.

We can stare right into the face of whatever comes.
We'll rise above it all, oh, this mighty, mighty.
We got a mighty mighty love.

I feel it when we're touching, a power starts rushing.
Yeah, this is something, been a long time coming.
Oh baby, what we have here is a future with no fear.

Together we stand on this mighty mighty love.
This mighty mighty love.

Mighty love, mighty love.
