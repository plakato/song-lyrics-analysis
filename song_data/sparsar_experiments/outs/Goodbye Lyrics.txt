Goodbye Lyrics
by X.


I really tried to be a good guy 
But. Ever since my child'hood, i -felt so lonely, if only they understood my 
Pain. Maybe if i had some encouragement, i'd feel the passion that'd inspire me
so. I would try 
But right now. I feel like i could cry 
Sometimes. I wonder if i should die -and give up on life and say goodbye, 
goodbyeee, cruel world 
I don't fit in or belong here, so good, bye, cruel world 
Goodbyeeeeee ... goodbyeeee 
 
Trust me. I am no fool 
I'm aware that this world is so cruel, 
 
But. I don't understand the reason i was put in this'''place'n. Why i'm here 
It seems to me, like i'm jiss'''wastin' my time here. 
 
I feel, like my life, has no meaning er purpose. 
People keep yellin' at me screaming yer, worthless, 
 
Life in this world is so unfair. It'S so ridiculous. 
I'M over sick of this 
 
I try to enjoy life so much. I'M fuckin' dyin' to live a bit 
I'm tryin'. To give a shit. 
But nothin' is goin'. My way 
Shit just keeps gettin' worse'n, there's always somethin' to fuck up my day, 
 
I feel sick. So i seek help from doctors, but the motherfuckers don't care about
me. They just want their damn money 
'n. I can't even trust my own fuckin' family 
 
I'm, tired of life, but i'm scared to die -i'm so accustomed to this bullshit
i'm too despaired to cry 
 
And. It seems this paranoia'''i feel is real'n. I appear to be hexed 
My own mother'''still is stealin'. My security checks, 
 
It's, gotten to the point. I only see the worst in people -i feel like every
person's, evil, 
I'm pessimistic'n paranoid to the point. I'M always lookin' at life's bad
side 
I, look at my empty past and lack of accomplishments and wonder what life
would've been like. If i had tried 
'n honestly, i wish that i had died- 
Instead of my sister -miranda or on second thought. She'D have to suffer
instead, but goddamnit. I miss her 
I see her in my dreams'n. All these memories are painful, but i continue to
keep these re'''mind'''ers intact- 
Even. When pain awakens me'n compels me to put every emotion into each line

I contemplate endurin' life'n its struggles'n. I don't think it's worth
livin' for it. 
I put in so much work, but bullshit is all i'm given for it. 
'N i'm sick of takin'. This shit 
It's, like i got diarrhea my stomach's upset just thinkin' about every effort
i'm makin'. Is it 
Worth? It -what's the point of earth it 
Bothers me'n. I have so many questions. 
I want the right answers'n, it seems only god has'em lord. Do you have any
suggestions 
 ... 
Tell me after i die where the fuck am i gon na go 
Will, i be just another memory rottin' in the earth, or will i experience
eternal bliss or damnation? I wan na know 
 ... 
Cause as it is. I go to sleep each night, dreamin' of death wonderin' what it
would be like if i would die, tommorow 
'n, finally be able to say good, bye to sorrow, 
, ... 
I feel like leavin'. This world cause there's really nothin' to stay for 
Livin' every day, sore-always yearnin' for way more 
Takin' shots at life. Hopin' i may score 
But. I always come up way short 
, ..., 
This, depraved world isn't worth stayin''n livin' in 
'n, i'm sick of dealin'. With this constant bullshit, my resolve's finally
swayin''n givin' in 
 ... 
To, my head, i put the barrel of a loaded, pistol, 
'n, pray to god, i'll go to a place. That'S happy'n blissful 
 
I feel like i don't belong in this world. I don't'''' wan na live in-i, don't fit
in 
'n when i feel like i'ma succumb to the stress. I try to tell myself i'm
not''' gon na give in -i won't quit'n- 
 
I'ma continue composin'. These songs'n keep writin''till. I die cause my life
is a mess. 
So, i'm always upset attemptin' to release my emotions, i'm tryin' to stress 
But. I fail so i'm uptight'n socially awkward cause, i'm always too shy'n
depressed 
There's a war in my mind, transpirin''n i'm dyin' fightin' against the tears i
do cry'n suppress, 
 
I'M, ALWAYS TIRED, BUT WHEN I'M TOO FRIGHTENED TO REST''''N I'M SCARED. I HAVE
NOONE TO RUN TO I 
FEEL LIKE SAYIN'. I'M DONE GUH BYE 
I WANT HELP, BUT NONE OF MY- 
FRIENDS UNDERSTAND WHY I FEEL THIS WAY OR KNOW OF THE OTHER FEELINGS THAT I
UNDERLIE 
'N RIGHT NOW. I FEEL LIKE PUTTIN', A GUN TO MY 
HEAD'N BLASTIN' IT. I AI N'T GON NA LIE. -Honestly I WAN NA DIE 
BUT. I REALLY WAN NA ENJOY LIFE, SO I KEEP TELLIN' MYSELF THAT I'M GON NA TRY- 
TO MOVE ON, BUT I'M OVERWHELMED BY THE OBSTACLES IN FRUNNA, MY 
PATH, AND IT MAKES ME JUST WAN NA CRY. 
I KEEP PRAYIN' TO GOD FOR HELP'N ANSWERS, BUT HE WO N'T RESPOND. I WONDER WHY 
MAN ALL I FUCKIN' WANTED WAS ONE REPLY: 
BUT NOW, I'M SUICIDAL AND HOMICIDAL RUMMAGIN' THROUGH MY GUN SUPPLY, 
 
I ATTEMPT TO CONJURE UP WORDS FOR A SUICIDE LETTER'N, HOW I SHOULD'''SAY GOOD
BYE 
TO EVERYONE, BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT I JUST WISH''''THEY WOULD DIE 
 
'N, AS I WRITE THESE WORDS, I TRY TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT I DO N'T CARE ANYMORE 
BUT. If THAT'S TRUE, THEN WHY DOES THE THOUGHT OF DEATH KEEP SCARIN' ME FOR 
 
WHEN. I'Ve BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY DEPRESSION'N TRAGEDY, 
WHILE OTHER PEOPLE JUST WALK PAST ME WITHOUT AGGRESSION'N. Happily, 
BRAG ABOUT THEIR GOOD TIMES'N, THEIR SILLY HAPPY LIVES, 
IGNORANT OF OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THEM'N, THEIR REALLY CRAPPY LIVES. 
'N DO N'T UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ME EVERY DAY. Go THROUGH 
THEY JUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT YOU BASED ON THEIR PRECONCEPTIONS'N THAT
THINK. They KNOW YOU 
 
Sayin', you're special and your life's precious, but i honestly don't know why
i'm even alive. 
I want to find the will to achieve'n the drive- 
To live, but i've lost all motivation and interest to go on. So i feel like i
have no reason to strive- 
I try to take advantage of the happy things in life, but i'm bein' deprived 
Instead people take advantage of me, so i feel like a bee in a hive. 
I feel like i don't wan na live yet i continue'''still to breathe'n survive 
I've accomplished nothin'. If only i had some real achievement to thrive 
On, but i don't so. I just mope around lookin' down on happy higher class people
at, the top with anger. While they look down on'''me in delight, 
I respond with indifferent apathy, though they don't recognize my agony. And
Pleadin' despite-, 
My cries'n respond by'''bein', polite -instead of relievin' the plight 
I'm in distressin' in depression, stressin' attemptin' expressions, tryin' to
stress, it fuck everyone. I want to exceed'n to write 
So, i'm needin' the might-to succeed'n to fight 
So. My future won't be bleak'n unbright-in, which case i'm seekin' the light 
But, i'm too blinded by rage, hatin' everybody, i'm insecure, weak'n, uptight 
'n. All i can do is grieve in the spite 
So fuck it. If i finish writin' this letter today, i'ma say goodbye to this
cruel world cause, i'm leavin' tonight, 
 
To go to a place afar'n. What lies ahead is unknown 
'n, i suspect i'ma probably go to hell, but i ain't goin' alone*echo alone 3
times* 
 
Since, my childhood i-tried - to be a good guy, 
But noone, understood my-pain, no matter how much i would try- 
To explain'n. It'S gotten to this point where i feel like i could cry 
Sometimes. I wonder if i should die -and give up on life and say goodbye, 
goodbyeee, cruel world 
I don't fit in or belong here, so good bye, cruel world 
Goodbyeeeeee, ... goodbyeeee
