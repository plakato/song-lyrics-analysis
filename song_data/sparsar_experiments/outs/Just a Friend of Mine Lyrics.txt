Just a Friend of Mine Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

Stop me in my tracks now.
You know Iʼll go too far.
I canʼt feel the moment.
Let me see the star.
Take me through the motions.
Know that you know how.
All the things that captivate.
You can save me now.

All the time going out of my mind.
See your smile such a different style.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.

All the time going out of my mind.
See your smile such a different style.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.

Good time conversation.
How could I forget.
I canʼt write off all the history.
All that I regret.
Feelings contradicting.
I canʼt work you out.
Too long complicating.
What weʼre all about.

All the time going out of my mind.
See your smile such a different style.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.

All the time going out of my mind.
See your smile such a different style.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.

All the time going out of my mind.
See your smile such a different style.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.

All the time going out of my mind.
See your smile such a different style.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.

All the time going out of my mind.
All you want to be is just a friend of mine.
All the time going out of my mind.
