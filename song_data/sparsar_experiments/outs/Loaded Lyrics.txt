Loaded Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Never need nobody cause I do this by myself.
You steady claiming that you rapping but you ask for help.
No chain up on my wrist I got no watch up on my shelve.
These bitches want my dick but I don't hit em up so now.

I'm gone like yo old bitch.
Gone like yo new bitch.
Gone like yo old bitch.
I'm gone like yo new bitch.

These bitches they ain't getting to me.
Cut ya fucking face if you are trying to play.
I keep this bitch just right up on me and the switch by the haze.
I'm thinking bitches are just bitches lets just smoke up and sing.
I roll a jay and get to smokin you can watch me sipping potions bitch i'm.
loaded.
