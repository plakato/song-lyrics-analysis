Make Up Your Mind Lyrics
by The Union.

Make up your mind, make up your mind.
Don't waste your time girl, make up your mind.
No word of a lie now.
This I declare.
These eyes ain't never seen.
A lady so fair.
I've never been one.
To settle for second best.
Let me take your hand.
And put all your fears to rest.
Make up your mind, make up your mind.
Don't waste your time girl, make up your mind.
You can rest easy.
Your thrust I won't betray.
No scenes behind your back.
Your faith I'll repay.
You think you've got me all worked out.
But you got me all wrong.
Just gimme a chance to prove that I'm the one you want.
Make up your mind, make up your mind.
Don't take your time girl, make up your mind.
I await your reply don't you take all day.
Make up your mind, make up your mind.
Feeling like a fool.
Waiting here for you to save me.
Put me outta my misery.
You gotta let me know.
What have I got to do.
What do I have to say.
I'm gonna make you see.
Make no mistake.
Just a little sign now.
Is all that I need.
So come tell me girl.
What's it gonna be?
Make up your mind, make up your mind.
Don't take your time girl, make up your mind.
I await your reply don't you take all day.
Make up your mind, make up your mind.
