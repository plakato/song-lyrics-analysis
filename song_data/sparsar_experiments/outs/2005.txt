I speak ebonics so you know I'm bilangual.
Homie I'm eatin, so get off of my table.
Off of my table like I just won in beirut.
Fresh Polo horses, out of my stable.
And I just wish these rappers could use some sign language.
Now, give me credit like you tryna find payment.
I spit so much it's like I need some hydration.
My terms are lamen, and your words are lame and.
You sound like a clip of me, Chris Kaman.
Ten years from now you will still be the same men.
While I sign on the X like ref called a flagrant.
Now these niggas bump it like they fucked up shavin.
Going up they chin but they went against the grain.
I fly sideways to shock you like I'm Raiden.
Versus DC, R2 L2, I'm raging.

I'm a new name in the game and I came in to win.
Not McCain or Sarah Palin, ancient.
A to the Zig goes noodles, Ramen.
A to the Zig goes noodles, Ramen.
