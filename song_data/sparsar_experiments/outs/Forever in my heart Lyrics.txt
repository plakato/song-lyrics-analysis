Forever in my heart Lyrics
by 4 P.M..

From the moment I saw your face.
My life was changed forever.
I couldn't deny the feelings inside my heart my heart.

Like the rainbow after the rain.
Your light shines thru and heals all my pain.
You're all that I need, and I'll know you'll always be.

Forever in my heart, you're the only one I'm thinking of.
I could spend all of my days with you.
Yes it's true, forever, forever in my heart.

You've shown me love in a special way.
With trust and understanding.
My life was so empty, until I layed eyes on you on you.

Like the rainbow after the rain.
Your light shines thru and heals all my pain.
You're all that I need, and I'll know you'll always be.

Forever in my heart, you're the only one I'm thinking of.
I could spend all of my days with you.
Yes it's true, forever, forever in my heart.
You're the only one I'm thinking of.
Yes it's true, forever, forever in my heart.

talking.

When there's a time,when there's a time when we're together when we're.
together.
When we're apart, it seems like forever.

You'll be forever, forever in my heart.........

Forever in my heart, you're the only one I'm thinking of.
I could spend all of my days with you.
Yes it's true, forever, forever in my heart........
