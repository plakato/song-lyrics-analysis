Chop Lyrics
by Xavier.


Hold up, tell them wait a second.
Y'all was saving hoes and I was working on my checking.
Flexing, skinny but I'm flexing.
And we can never let no basic bitches in the section.
And they too busy snapping, they be living on the gram.
And I'm just tryna feel a couple million in my hand.
Planes, getting to the bands.
The good is dying young so it's RIP to Yams.
Hold up, we don't even celebrate.
? time so you know that we was hella late.
We just serving niggas like a plate of food.
Skinny nappy nigga with an attitude.
Hating niggas hating but it's gratitude.
You don't really make it until everybody mad at you.
Champagne spraying like the uzi.
Bitches in jacuzzis like the shit you see in movies.

If I roll it it's a chop, it's a chop.
Do this shit a lot, watch.
If I roll it it's a chop, it's a chop.
Dollar for my thoughts, dollar for my thoughts.

If I roll it it's a chop, it's a chop.
Do this shit a lot, watch.
If I roll it it's a chop, it's a chop.
Dollar for my thoughts, dollar for my thoughts.

Say goodbye to last night, it was nice to know you.
We just coming live from south side California.
Airing out a zone that you can smell the Arizona.
She love it when I treat it like the owner.
Speaking of hormones.
Y'all leaking out of order.
See too many rappers that be creeping on the border.
When all I do is slaughter.
Man we growing up, watching couple homies growing daughters.
But still we drink for those who never got to be a father.
Watch your video I'm really gon' be bothered, nah don't bother.
I don't get the world just to get the guaca.
My bitch at the opera.
She be on the same shit, rolling up a chopper.
Popped so many things, man I feel like I'm a doctor.
Coming for your commas.
Some' your baby mamas.
Out from ? like Obamas.
Weed kicking lobster, hope that's what they serving.
Once I win the cup then I'm gon' get right back to working.
Certified flow how you know this shit for certain.
Three to girl play, yeah it's curtain, perfect.
Everything I have, bet I earned it.
We ain't invent the wheel, we just showed you where to turn it.

If I roll it it's a chop, it's a chop.
Do this shit a lot, watch.
If I roll it it's a chop, it's a chop.
Dollar for my thoughts, dollar for my thoughts.

If I roll it it's a chop, it's a chop.
Do this shit a lot, watch.
If I roll it it's a chop, it's a chop.
Dollar for my thoughts, dollar for my thoughts.
