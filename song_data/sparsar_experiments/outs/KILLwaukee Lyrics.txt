KILLwaukee Lyrics
by Vivafidel & Gat Turner.

In Killwaukee, 
 
We are at war, Stand up Not even safe in the womb here: 
Gat Turner, Viva, Fidel…in, Killwaukee.., 
, 
GatTurner 
I, wear the stamp of the camp that I'm trapped on 
Flowing through my veins Branded on my backbone 
I'm roaming, with a mask on blending. With the captives 
You learn to stretch a dollar like your money, was elastic, 
Freaks come out at night and then return to their caskets 
Get caught out of bounds. Mess around and get your ass kicked. 
Just ask “Big. Dog” even Glen fell into a pitfall. 
“You should've built a Boys Club Better run that shit…” Killwaukee Style 
God bless the little child living foul, but that's a year's salary around your
neck 
Run. It Now
