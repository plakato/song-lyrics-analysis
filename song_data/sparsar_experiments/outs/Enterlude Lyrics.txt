Enterlude Lyrics
by Punsy.

I'Mma, take you all into a world, you never thought existed
Close your eyes and let my words open up your mind and listen
 .... At this very moment, you are sitting in a chair
You are feeling very fair, not giving any care
Now. You feel your body shifting, like you're lifting don't be scared
Your position now is different. You'Ve ascended to the air
You are resting with the clouds wind blowing in your hair
All. Your senses now have flared. You are feeling more aware
Can. You see what I have painted smell the air in all its greatness 
Are. You feeling so amazing from these sounds that you can taste it 
â€¦.Free from the restraints of all reality and changes
Agony and pain with fallacy and hatred
That will negated through the peace that I'm creating
On. These beats and for my peeps cuz, I'm completely obligated
I'd be sad if you would waste this chance to view these places
Cuz. That was the arrangement for the tape that you are playing.
