Chris is Awesome Lyrics
by Viro the Virus.

Chris is awesome: hes
as hot, as it gets 
The type to drop ya. Quick with a mafia. Kick 
Hes got the hunger of a young lion 
Plus the eye of the tiger 
Pummel you like hes, a young Tyson, 
That young knockout, kid split ya: wig 
Rivera Cloverleaf snap
you, like a twig 
Your, more than welcome to step up and get f'ed up from a hangmans Clutch
 or heros welcome
 
Your, just a Josmo 
He'll bust, your chops 
Its, a K.O once he
hammerlocks, the cravate 
Tomato cans, don't stand a chance. 
No holds barred, 
Rolling Elbow to a
bozos jaw, 
Its flawless offence done with precision. 
Get lumped up he's head hunting for the submission 
Pound for pound the best without a doubt, 
So come on down and get left out for the count. 
 
Better bring ya best. Cuz here comes the best 
So whos your hero, 
Its Chris Hero 
Quick to end ya. 
Any contender 
So whos your hero, 
Its Chris Hero, 
Ya, better call, the coppers, ya mama and a doctor 
Yous about to get clobbered in a slobber, knocker, 
Cruisin or abusin 
Ain't, no way: hes losin 
So whos your hero, 
Its Chris Hero, 
, 
Don't brawl with this grappler 
He'Ll flatten ya 
Theyll have to get ya with a spatula 
Be his guest to leave a bloody mess. 
You can't F with his moveset 
Take your breath in a slugfest with a suplex 
Violence at its finest 
Pound you with the ground game or high flyin like hes death defying 
No lying. This is real as it gets. 
A, perfect mix of killer instinct with ring general ship 
Apply, a Double Chickenwing, with a tight grip 
Middle of the ring. Have you crying? I quit 
Lucha Libre influence, 
King of wrestling
undisputed 
Swear. They hurt you in the square circle. Beat you stupid, 
With maunovers, higher impact, then a mule kick 
Leave. You toothless, 
Number 1 champion get the job done. 
When the bell rings. Get your bell rung 
 
Here! He comes 
 
Better bring ya best. Cuz here comes the best 
So whos, your hero, 
Its Chris Hero 
Quick to end ya, 
Any, contender, 
So, whos, your hero, 
Its Chris Hero, 
Ya, better call, the coppers, ya mama and a doctor 
Yous about to get clobbered in a slobber, knocker, 
Cruisin or abusin 
Ain't. No way hes losin 
So whos your hero, 
Its Chris Hero, 
 
You, leave the ring feeling miserable 
His defence is impenetrable 
So. The advantage is considerable 
If you want a war bet, he wants it more 
Better pass a peace pipe like your sitting, bull 
Looking for a sweat lick. He ain't one 
You want love, get a show on VH1 
Cuz. He don't play games boy. Your get maimed, 
His main aim is to inflict pain, 
Leave the ring apron blood stained 
Have the crowd going wild like there untamed 
He'll win easily, like your untrained, 
Then, grin evilly. While you complain 
Once again, it's flawless offense done with precision. 
Get lumped up he's head hunting for a submission 
Pound for pound the best without a doubt, 
So come on down and get knocked. The fuck out, 
 
Better bring ya best. Cuz here comes the best 
So whos your hero, 
Its Chris Hero 
Quick to end ya. 
Any contender 
So whos your hero, 
Its Chris Hero, 
Ya, better call, the coppers, ya mama and a doctor 
Yous about to get clobbered in a slobber, knocker, 
Cruisin or abusing 
Ain't no way. Hes losin 
So whos your hero, 
Its Chris Hero
