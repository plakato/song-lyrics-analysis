Self Sufficient Lyrics
by Visionaries.


Here'S a little somethin''bout, a MC like me, 
Dropped Kozmonauts and Galleries independently 
Key-Kool, I likes to say, 
That, I'm a fresh lyricist from around the way 
Since. I was a youth, a straight b-boy 
Now, I'm takin' out all the sucker decoys 
Flippin' a rhyme or two. That'S what the hell I do, 
You, don't like how I'm livin'! Well, you 
This is hip-hop and I'm in it 
My man Rhett will cut you up in a minute, 
With a cut stab crab flare, so 
And. Then he claims his crew. The Beat Junkies 
Everywhere. We go, they say. 
Visionaries is up the program 
And. Then you realize that we all care 
For. Those who just don't know we're throwin' V's in the air 
And keep makin' straight up 
Does. It look like. I have to make a hit 
To a major label that wan na sign me: 
Rap ain't nothin', but a way to make money. 
But, I'm the type of MC that's built to last 
If you wan na pimp me, I put my foot in your ass 
See. I don't give a how many records you're sellin' 
Yo, what the are they yellin 
 
Make money money, make money, money, money, 
Make, money, money, make money, money, money,

Just, like King Midas, as I was told, 
In this rappin' Olympics fools, are rushin' for gold, 
With or without code; better change, your mode 
Tryin' to be down with dough on the yellow, brick road 
Wizard of Oz complexes, goin' for the riches; 
No heart, no brain cowardly loss to The bitches 
Too weak to lead so they're followin', 
Week-kneed MC's, now only suck to swallowin' 
Fallin' in the trap of big money. Crap 
The only real big baller who started rappin' is Shaq 
They act large, but it's evident 
You only make minimum percent unless you're the president 
I'm want self-empowerment. So others'll pay me rent 
And. I can control my artistic intentions. 
Make investments count all my blessings. 
See, the Age of Aquarius in fifth dimensions: 
Comprehension like Babu 
Dynamic, like the Duo it's
the two, you know 
Key-Kool and Rhettmatic always come well equipped. 
And, like a club in Manila, we'll make your whole party Flip
