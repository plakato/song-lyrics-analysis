I'm Afraid Lyrics
by Xavier.


Yeah.. there is a moment when you actually have to, fucking grow up.

But I don't wanna grow up, I wanna stay where I am.
I just wanted to dream.
To be free.
To be heard.
To be me.
And I'm afraid to hear what people might think.
And I'm afraid that I'll grow up to be mean.
To be hated, un-trusted.
I'm afraid when I'm married the girls will come back that I lusted.
For, then they run out the door.
Then I never see them again. no more.
And that I feel dead inside, I am dead inside....
But I'm afraid to let it show, and I'm afraid to let them know.
That I wish I can die.
I wish they knew I wasn't afraid of suicide...
Of suicide.
But, I'm afraid that I won't go to heaven.
I'm afraid that I will go to hell.
And I'm afraid that I will never learn my lessons.
And I'm afraid that I will never do well.
And I'm afraid that I never stop lying.
Cause I really truly am afraid of dying.
I'm just lying to myself... I really hate myself.
I'm afraid of what people might think of this song.
I'm afraid cause I've been holding this in for too long.
I'm afraid to feel anything cause I'm dead inside.
I'm afraid cause I forgot how it feels to be alive.

I forgot how it feels to be alive.
Well ain't that some shit....
