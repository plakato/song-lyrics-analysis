Dear Love Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

You said you'd conquer all, you would catch me if I fall.
But you were never there at all, Dear Love.
Said you were all I need, and you were like the air I breathe.
So why you suffocating me? Dear Love.

And now I wonder if you even know my name.
Lately you've been acting strange, Dear Love.
And now I feel so abandoned, shattered and broken.
I'm lookin' for answers and nobody's showin.
I thought that you changed instead you got me again, Dear Love.

I gave you all I had, but you're asking for more than that.
And you ain't givin' nothing back, Dear Love.
Is this all in vain? Or some kind of game?
I'm pouring my heart out, can't you see the stains?
Do even care that I go through such pain? For Love.

And now I wonder if you even know my name.

Lately you've been acting strange, Dear Love.
And now I feel so abandoned, shattered and broken.
I'm lookin' for answers and nobody's showin.
I thought that you changed instead you got me again, Dear Love.

And now I wonder if you even know my name.
Lately you've been acting strange, Dear Love.
And now I feel so abandoned, shattered and broken.
I'm lookin' for answers and nobody's showin.
I thought that you changed instead you got me again, Dear Love.

And now I feel so abandoned, shattered and broken.
I'm lookin' for answers and nobody's showin.
I thought that you changed instead you got me again, Dear Love.
