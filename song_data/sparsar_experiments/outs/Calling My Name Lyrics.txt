Calling My Name Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

Hmm Ooh yeah 
I got ta slip away. 
Cuz all these memories of you and me. 
So crazy 
I got ta clear some space, 
I'm tryin' figure out just how it got this way. 
You dont' even know what I've been through. 
You push me to the door: 
And walk me through 
And. Now you want me back 
But, I'm so through with you, 
 
Release me from this love. 
 
But, its so wrapped up, 
Stop call 
Stop callin 
Stop callin, my name 
My name, 
Stop callin me 
Stop callin. My name 
Could you please stop callin me 
Please, stop 
Please, stop callin me 
Please, stop 
Please, stop callin, my name, 
 
I use to be afraid to live without you 
So. I never once complained. 
 
Until. I found my strenght 
To finally get up on my feet and run away. 
If you see me out with another guy 
Don't be suprised cuz. You know why 
 
I-I was already done. 
So, don't keep tryin to pull me back. 
I want you to 
 
Release me from this love: 
 
But, its so wrapped up, 
Stop call 
Stop callin 
Stop callin, my name 
My name, 
Stop callin me 
Stop callin, my name 
Could! You! Please stop! Callin me 
Please! Stop! 
Please! Stop! Callin me! 
Please! Stop! 
Would! You! Please stop callin my name: 
 
Stop call 
Stop callin 
Stop callin, my name 
My name, 
Stop callin me 
Stop callin, my name 
Could! You! Please stop callin me 
Please! Stop! 
Please! Stop! Callin me 
Please! Stop 
Would! You! Please stop callin! My name
