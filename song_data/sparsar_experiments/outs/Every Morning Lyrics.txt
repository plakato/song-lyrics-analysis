Every Morning Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.

Produced by Whoarei The O'My's and Donnie Trumpet 
 
Sample Sun Ra 
My story is not a part of history 

Why. Should it 

Cassette Change. 
 
Every Morning, when I wake, I can't help. But thinking of you, I'm dreaming. Of
You 
 
Let's find the essence of life. 
And battle through every strife 
Because somewhere between heaven and hell, 
Are, just songs of happiness. We all can yell 
But. I can't sing them alone. I need you, 
 
, The O'My's Ziyaad Luce≈ç,,
