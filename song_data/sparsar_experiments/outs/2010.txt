All the ladies say hoooo

Haha 
A-Z 
I'm on my grind, shorty, don't block my shine. Shorty 
Hold up hold up. My nigga jus showed up 
Know what roll up get that L poured up. 
Im on my grind: shorty! Don'T block my shine, shorty 
Wait, a second wait: a minute 
My nigga just paid a visit, 
I can't close a dutch no more cause. I got too much reefer in it. 
 
Boy, stopp, 
 
Man. I ain't seen you in while 
Since we was a couple. Kids, rebelious actin wild 
20 deep at the lunchtable 
Freestyling, causing ruckus 
Ignorant mothafuckas 
P butter, jelly lunches, 
Ahhhhhh, 
My nigga. Those were the days 
Nobody had no jobs and nobody had no babies. 
The most important things were basketball and ladies 
The Friday, night games. And after that we were blazin 
Nostalgia hittin major at the time nothin could faze us 
Couldn't stay in my ways. 
So. I guess i miss the days 
When. We had more time to play 
You family to the end. 
My nigga here go the j like 
 
Im on my grind: shorty, don't block my shine. Shorty 
Hold up hold up. My nigga jus showed up 
Know what roll up get that L powed up 
Im on my grind: shorty, don't block my shine! Shorty 
Wait! A second wait: a minute 
My nigga jus paid a visit. 
I can't close a dutch no more cause. I got too much reefer in it.
