All Day And All Of The Night Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Ray Davies.

I'm not content to be with you in the day time.
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time.
The only time I feel alright is by your side.
Girl I want to be with you all of the time.

All day and all of the night.
All day and all of the night.
All day and all of the night.

I believe that you and me last forever.
Oh yeah, all day and night time yours, leaves me never.
The only time I feel alright is by your side.
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time.

All day and all of the night.
All day and all of the night.
All day and all of the night oh yeah.

I believe that you and me last forever.
Oh yeah, all day and night time yours, leaves me never.
The only time I feel alright is by your side.
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time.

All day and all of the night.
All day and all of the night.
All day and all of the night.
