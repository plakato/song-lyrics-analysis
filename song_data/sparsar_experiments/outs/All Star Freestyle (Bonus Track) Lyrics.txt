All Star Freestyle (Bonus Track) Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


Hahahahaha 
Ruff Ryder 3 
Time for the younger generation to blow 
You know. I brought my nigga with me.. 
D-Block 
 
Aiyyo, it's Jae Hood bitch respect my bars. 
The doctors have to piece together your face. Like a collage 
Niggas, always talk greasy till the steel come out. 
And slugs rip through they gums and their grill come out. 
Motherfuck you and fuck your mans 
If. I don't clap you in the dome 
I'mma leave clips in your diaphragm 
I'm, the hood prophet puff purple instead of chocolate, 
Stay from around chumps and cowards cause, they gossip, 
And I'mma stay on the corner like stop signs 
With, a pack of them creamy, colored rocks and The Glock 9 
When you speaking of the hardest nigga 
Bring Hood name up: 
D-Block bitch --. We about to have the game chained up, 
My words too strong bars too powerful 
And your towel can't dry you when them dumdums shower you 
Y'all mad cuz, y'all garbage and your lyrics is boring. 
And your whip was made the same year that you was born in 
 
Listen man,
