Care of Cell 44 Lyrics
by The Zombies.

Good morning to you I hope you're feeling better, baby.
Thinking of me while you are far away.
Counting the days until they set you free again.
Writing this letter, hoping you're okay.

Saved you the room you used to stay in every Sunday.
The one that is warmed by sunshine every day.
And we'll get to know each other for a second time.
And then you can tell me 'bout your prison stay.

Feels so good you're coming home soon.

It's gonna to be good to have you back again with me.
Watching the laughter play around your eyes.
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money.
Kiss and make up and it will be so nice.

Feels so good you're coming home soon.

Walking the way we used to walk.
And it could be so nice.
We're talking the way we used to talk.
And it could be so nice.

It's gonna be good to have you back again with me.
Watching the laughter play around your eyes.
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money.
Kiss and make up and it will be so nice.

Feels so good you're coming home soon.

Feels so good you're coming home soon.
