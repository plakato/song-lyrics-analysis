Anne Dong Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

Grab my face.
As hard as it's funny to you.
While i pretend.
I'm your real dad.
How is anne's cough today miss sheryl.
I pretend to ask.
A daughter who i bug.
And can only stand to be around me for about 30 seconds.
But whose picture i wear.
In a pin inside my coat.
So, who is this picture.
That's you anne.
You're not coming to my birthday.
Oh, i know.
