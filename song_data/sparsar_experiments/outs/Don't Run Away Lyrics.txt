Don't Run Away Lyrics
by Tyler James Williams.

Tyler James Williams, 
Her beauty's, crazy, 
I watch her from the crowd. 
Her voice is so amazing. 
She make her momma, proud. 
I tried to send her flowers 
But. She has no address 
Her home is in my heart. 
It'S like she never left. 
 
This is more than a crush 
More than a like, like 
More than a love. 
Baby I'mma make you mine, 
And. I ain't giving up 
X2 
 
Don't run away. 
Don'T run away from the truth. 
Cause I'm not giving up on you 
X2 
 
Shawty. You got fire 
But, I'm preaching to the choir. 
I know you know. 
The whole world is watching you, so 
 
Don't run away. 
Don'T run away from the truth. 
Cause, I'm not giving up on you. 
 
 Tyler, James Williams, 
Uh they say true. Love is blind. 
That real romance is timeless. 
You'Re, like my favorite movie, 
Play it and rewind it 
Cuz baby you're, the finest 
Your love I'm gon na find it 
And. When I do I'll run away with you 
Somewhere, where they can't find us 
, 
 Tyler, James Williams, 
Normally. I couldn't turn your head 
That's why I had to write this instead, 
Let's be friends, start out slow, 
Get to know you beyond your glow, 
You're more than meets the eye 
Girl you pterodactyl fly 
Way back when you knew my name 
Now. The truth is, what is what I claim
