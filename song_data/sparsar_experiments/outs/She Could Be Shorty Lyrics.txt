She could be shorty x3.
Let her roll the weed for me.
She could be shorty x4.
Let her roll my weed for me.
Yeah, she could be shorty.
She could be shorty.

Said she like new Benji's and new Fendi and old BAPE and new Benzes.
And late nights when the mood hitting.
She like kush more she don't do indica.
To be honest almost too into her.
One thing man, don't screw it up.
Ass thick in that tight dress, so much I wish that it was two of her.
Hennessy and expensive weed.
? hopping, Soho shopping sprees.
Spendin' cheese, and on gasoline.
And her heels is hot, she be sipping lean.
We getting high to enjoy the ceiling.
Fly as hell and she down to earth.
Or down to mars, somewhere in between.
Could be nothing, could be everything.
That's saying something, naw girl I ain't playing nothing.
You could ball around with me, that's and one.
Just know that you're dealing with a player one, that's a heads up.
I'm hope that I open, your mind and them legs up.
By the end of the night I'm hoping I open.
Your mind and them legs up.
So what's up?

She taking chances, got to say what up to my lowlifes.
No set, get chances, nother 40 ounces of that high life.
With a fat blunt get my mind right, that's my pussy, she stay tight.
Leaving right now, she on the first flight, and she could fuck all night.
Ain't no telling but I just might, I could tell her when I eat what she taste.
like.
It's just me and you so it's on sight, Hennessy and that's on ice.
The way Rosa P was all on Spike, best time of your whole life.
Best time of your whole life, I can tell the groupie girl ain't your type.
And honestly it ain't mine either.
I'm talking clothesblinds and fine reefer.
Red wine party in the speaker.
Talking red wine party in the speaker.
