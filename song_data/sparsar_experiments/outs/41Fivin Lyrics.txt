41Fivin Lyrics
by 415.


This one is dedicated to the posse.
The founder, the author of 'Niggas Just Jock Me'.
The DJ Daryl who cuts so sweet.
Fuck the bullshit, the man makes beats.
The Jigga, the gee, the J, the E, the D.
My road dog, the man Slick Money.
415 complete, that's it.
A new year's resolution to make hits.
'89 my pen and paper were taxed.
But see in '90, my shit is comin on wax.
Money put together right, so we could use it.
Talent so damn tight, we make music.
Loc, a mic artist, straight sinister.
DJ Daryl on the cut, the Prime Minister.
The J the E the D, straight lethal.
But in the '90s he's goin legal.
Those who don't know will soon be realizin.
That the crew is just 41Fivin.

*DJ Daryl cuts up*.

415 is the code to the Eastside.
So if you're not strong, fold to the weak side.
Loc's got the ammo, I ride the tank.
Daryl does the cuttin and JED packs the bank.
All from the Oaktown, but different spots.
Don't catch a bullet, punk, it's way hot.
The stage belongs to the crew that's on it.
So think about the funk before you say that you want it.
Because we came to do a show and we do it legit.
And we packed along a posse just to kill up shit.
See, a joke is a joke, like pullin a plug.
You catch a hot one when you're fuckin with a thug.
We don't play that shit, we believe in survival.
But we'll cold catch a murder beef when we're 41Fivin.

*DJ Daryl cuts up*.

Hey yo, kick back, take a seat, let a big mack.
Put some muthafuckin game to the dope track.
I don't mean to interrupt, but yo Rich.
I gotta put some shit to this dope cut.
Cause I'm a lyricist, I'm on a risin.
Here to let em know I be 41Fivin.
Step up or press up, you might mess up.
The program, because the Locster is fed up.
I'm on a mission to give em what they're missin.
And tell you what you're lackin, boy, I mean business.
Stupid muthafuckas play me close, but hell no.
I couldn't be touched even if you tried to bumrush.
A rat pack, niggas better step back.
Steppin to the Locster and gets jacked.
That's how it is when you're fuckin with me.
But much worse when you're fuckin with the 415 posse.
I just limp like a pimp, grab my dick.
Wobble to the phone, then call up Rich.
I tell him like this: Yo, I got some funk.
So page Slick Money and meet me at the studio.
DJ Daryl's with me with no delay.
Rich pulls up with a trunk full of throwaways.
We slap the clip in the nine, now the punchline.
Ran up on the enemies and started 41Fivin.

*DJ Daryl cuts up*.

Time to break east, I hear sirens.
Man, I hate those punk police.
I'm finna lounge in the cut and duck one.
I popped his ass and that was just for fun.
That's what the muthafucka get for playin a role.
He stepped to me and then I ran up his asshole.
Now I got a murder beef, they can't catch me.
I'm on the loose in the Oakland streets.
Hustlin, and man, it ain't easy.
So a nigga like me gets greedy.
I need all I can get, no bullshit.
I won't stop until I feel the muthafuckin ???
If that mean straight killin and jackin.
Robbin and stealin - well hey, that's what's happenin.
See, I don't bite the tongue for no one.
I ain't lyin, I'm just 41Fivin.

*DJ Daryl cuts up*.

*DJ Daryl cuts up*.

Yo Loc, I hate police, and that's treacherous.
I'm on the run too but man, they ain't catchin us.
I got too many bitches in the Oakland streets.
Use for hide-outs when I sense the heat.
See, a murder ain't shit when a brother stays packin.
Loose on the streets, gettin his money on stackin.
Sucker wanna run up, cowards, you get popped.
I'm on a rampage and can't be stopped.
And the one who tries, to the dirt he'll be divin.
Cause Double R don't joke when he's 41Fivin.

Rich, I'm in the game, man, all about stackin.
Rollin with the posse at night but I'm packin.
Can't turn my back for niggas tryin to gat me up.
Cause on the real tip, I don't give a fuck.
Never mind the name, just admit it.
I'm a mack to the heart, so come with it.
Nigga, be down to astound the world.
You won't be shit if you don't pimp the 'white girl'.
Sellin dope is basically what I'm sayin.
I'm comin up cause muthafuckas keep payin.
For my product, cause yo, I gives a fuck about a job.
Artist workin 9 to 5 hardest.
I make more in a day than you a month.
You can do the same, but you're scared of the game, punk.
Broke bastard need to be strivin.
Like me, or 41Fivin.
