Alive Lyrics
by WordPlay T.JAY.


Listen I'm too inclined to free my mind.
It's nothing to do with science I'm doing fine.
Just taking another step, I'm due to climb.
Saw the knowledge in the garden now the fruit is mine.
Tried ending it all I guess the Lord declined.
He'll erase it and I guess I'll leave my flaws behind.
Turn another page and never press rewind.
And since I get another chance I'm working over time.
Creating a monster dark as the freshest wine.
Quickly cut the power off and hurry close the blinds.
I can't let the neighbors see until my boys alive.
Ha, I'm doctor Frankenstein.
