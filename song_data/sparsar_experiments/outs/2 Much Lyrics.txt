2 Much Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


All this time 
Too damn high 
 
Rich Rollski, ... 
 
All. This time, I'm thinkin' that 
I'm just too damn high 
But. The truth is thinkin' about you. 
I'Ve been thinkin' about you, 
Been thinkin' about you, 
Been thinkin', about you too much 
 
Can. I hit it. One more time, 
Can, I hit it one more time: 
Bitch stop playin' cuz. You know that pussy mine, 
 
Yea, this bitch fine, but you is, on my mind, 
When I'm fuckin her 
Girl. You know me. I ain't lovin', her 
I'm thinkin' bout, you when I'm fuckin' her 
Girl, I'm feelin, you wen I'm touchin' her 
 
, Why we got ta love from a distance baby, 
I just wan na fuck, this instant baby 
You ain't got to but listen baby 
Who you fuckin'. Lately got me goin' crazy, 
 
Let me hit it. Let me hit it. 
Baby bet a nigga miss you too much 
Pussy bomb. I salute, don't need a crew cut. 
We could jump in the 60. Kick ya shoes up 
Girl. You know you bomb call it Baghdad. 
Make the city go boom when that ass, clap, 
 
When, you throw it in a circle: I'ma 
Holup, fucka bitch, where the racks at 
Look all this time, punk bitch sittin here tryna act like she mine, 
All this time, nevermind fuck a bitch, I'm about to roll A dime 
 
Tell me somethin' everytime. I see you babygirl, you be frontin 
Too, damn late too. Damn fly everything about ya girl. Oh my 
My, my girl. Don'T stop doin what you're doin 
Cuz! You know. I got ta watch
