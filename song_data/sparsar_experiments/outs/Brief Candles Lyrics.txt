Brief Candles Lyrics
by The Zombies.

There she sits her hands are held.
Tight around her glass.
She only needs to be alone.
She knows this mood will pass.
To realize that she was strong.
And he too weak to stay.
And to realize that she is better off this way.

Brief candles in her mind.
Bright and tiny gems of memory.
Brief candles burn so fine.
Leaves a light inside where she can see.
What makes it all worthwhile.
Her sadness makes her smile....

His alone girl fades away.
Left out on a limb.
Finds he needs her more because.
She's no more need for him.
He understood so very well.
The things she had to say.
Soon he'll understand that he is better off this way.

Brief candles in his mind.
Bright and tiny gems of memory.
Brief candles burn so fine.
Leaves a light inside where he can see.
What makes it all worthwhile.
His sadness makes him smile....

In the corner see his face.
The man just sips his drink.
Not one feeling does he show.
Far too numb to think.
He does not say a single word.
No word of love to say.
Maybe he will soon believe he's better off this way....

Brief candles in his mind.
Bright and tiny gems of memory.
Brief candles burn so fine.
Leaves a light inside where he can see.
What makes it all worthwhile.
His sadness makes him smile....
