Dat True Lyrics
by XCEP.


I'm a one army, guess you know dat true.
It's that one independent fella, going for the win like a mo'fucking jew.
And I said they got zero shit on me, yeah you know dat true.
Ain't not comparing me to these fuck dudes.
You know I can go against all their crews at once, shit!
They got no clue, and I know that dat true.
They be like  where this nigga came from man?
Been here since forever stop acting like you never knew.
Bitch, I do what I mo'fucking do 'til forever, and you know dat true.
Bang! bang! bang! ain't no stopping.
Shit just begun as a keeper in this mo'fucking zoo.
Dat true, dat true! word!
King out here, fuck what you heard.
This that pure shit, fuck what you serve.
Fucking with me you got true nerves.
She got true curves and she on this dick.
Watch as I fucking own this quick.
Name a mo'fucka with a sound this thick.
Name a mo'fucka with a flow this slick.
Name a local nigga with a dream this big.
I don't think there is, these niggas never really think this big.
These niggas should really handle their biz'.
And let a real nigga be what he is.
Nigga higher than wiz.
So high he don't even exist.
You can hate me as much as you can.
But I'm making that shit that you can't resist.

You heard, the sound is on another level.
I just leave em in awe.
And I'm not even involved.
And most of these niggas know that I'm a fucking rebel.
I'm just doing all I know.
Scheming like the devil.
You know who it is.
And when they ask me how I do when I do what I do.
I just tell 'em all I know is that I'm here to kill you.
And dat true, dat true.
Yeah you know that dat true.
Dat true, dat true, dat.
