Chi No Ame(Blood Rain) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


I made a note to myself to keep smokin' and never stop.
Am i a bad person cause i don't give a fuck a lot.
My girl know i lie,how the fuck am i 'sposed to stop.
Hoes on my ?
Imma keep it real i flip but i never flop.
Seventy seven dollars on a hunna come holla back.
I know you got some weed give it all to the hoe in the back.
Nigga fuck you mean,you know i need all of that.
?
?
Im sittin in a cave with a rape goin in the back.
Ain't nobody hear it but myself and a blood splatter.
I dont give a fuck cause nothin does a matter.
Im on LSD all i hear is a bitch laughin.
Nigga find me in a  casket.

Ridin' all alone i ain't never goin' home.
Stayin' right here i ain't got nowhere to go.
I don't got a phone good luck on a call.
Backwoods gettin' rolled and the sky gets dark.
Clouds roll in,find it hard to stop the pain.
Trynna go backside,trynna stop the rain.
Flashbacks play everytime i hear your name.
Wake up from a dream hundred blunts to the face.

Now im ridin' slow,back to the place that i already go.
Now im ridin' slow,boys dont know but your girl know its Bones.
