Darkangel (Azrael) Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

In your dream you see me clear.
I have no restraint, no fear.
Powerless I watched from faces I'd assumed.
My purpose set, my will defined.
Caress the air, embrace the skies.
Escape the sorrow and restraint of mortal cities.

Give me time I will be clear.
Given time you'll understand.
What possesses me to right what you have suffered.
I'm in this mood because of scorn.
I'm in a mood for total war.
To the darkened skies once more and ever onward.

So many years I stood among the thoughts.
And tears of those I served.
Among my own I was alone through my own doing.
All the years I walked unknown.
Behind the faces I assumed.
Powerless to clear your mind of what you'd suffered.

Give me time I will be clear.
Given time you'll understand.
What possesses me to right what you have suffered.
I'm in this mood because of scorn.
I'm in a mood for total war.
To the darkened skies once more and ever onward.
There is no faith in which to hide.
Even truth is filled with lies.
Doubting angels fall to walk among the living.
I'm in this mood because of scorn.
I'm in a mood for total war.
To the darkened skies once more and ever onward.

I'd only come here seeking peace.
I'd only come here seeking me.

I'd only come here seeking peace.
I'd only come here seeking me.

I'd only come here seeking peace.
I'd only come here seeking me.
It seems I came to leave.
