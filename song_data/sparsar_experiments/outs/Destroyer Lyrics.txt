Destroyer Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

DESTROYER.

He spent his life.
A silent sentinel.
For all to fear.
He walks, he talks, he thinks, he feels.
But no one dare go near.

He takes in all he sees.
Nothing escapes his gaze.
And when he strikes.
He strikes for right.
A glorious sight.

Destroyer, Destroyer, Destroyer.
He's in town.

He came to be.
From a grand mistake.
A mystical charade.
Created to decide the good.
And bring repercussive aid.

As awareness filled his fame.
He examined those who leered.
Then he cleaved the air.
With his fiery stare.
Rend all those there.

Destroyer, Destroyer, Destroyer.
He's in town.
Destroyer, Destroyer, Destroyer.
He's in town.

A day will come.
You'll be drawn into.
The center of your town.
And come upon a mass of steel.
That cracks the very ground.

Prepare to meet your judge.
Don't think to run away.
Just pray your face.
Holds no disgrace.
For the deadly ace.

Destroyer, Destroyer, Destroyer.
He's in town.
Destroyer, Destroyer, Destroyer.

Oh he's in town.
Yeah, he's in town.
You better stay out of his fuckin' way.
He's gonna kick your ass.

Destroyer.
Destroyer.
