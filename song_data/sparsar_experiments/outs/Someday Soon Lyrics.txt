Someday Soon Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.

Everything familiar feels so new to me.
I might look the same but I'm not who I used to be.
The clocks still chimes, the world still turns.
I do know how I live this life here without you.
Oh, but someday soon.

Faith is gonna find a way to pull me through.
And we will be together once again someday soon.

Only God knows why it has to be this way.
There's no easy answers, there's no words to say.
The light that guides me through the dark.
Is knowing that these arms will hold you.
Strong and true, baby, someday soon.

And faith is gonna find a way to pull me through, ohh.

And faith is gonna find a way to pull me through.
And we will be together once again someday soon.

We will be together, we will be together.
We will be together someday soon.
We will be together, we will be together.
We will be together someday soon.
