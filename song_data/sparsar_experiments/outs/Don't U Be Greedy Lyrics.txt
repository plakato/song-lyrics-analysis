Don't U Be Greedy Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..


My dog gon' be home with a story to tell ya, see: 
Yall know what Im talm bout' ... .dont? U be greedy 
 
Ra-ta-tat-ta-tat- on you, dog, hoes Ra-ta-tat-ta-tat on you, dog, hoes, 
Twerk crawl, ride, giddy up Eddie Bow bounce for that outfit 
Twerk. For that hair fix crawl. For that Polo Rug then go get me two 
Slugga, don't have nothing. If I don't have you 
Like Whitney Houston Said I will always love you too 
Bounce for that outfit. The ones who mean it won't ya bounce for that outfit 
And. Don'T? U be greedy, don't-don't ya, be greedy 
 
Bitch. Now you don' made me go too far: 
And, let you buy the whole 3rd. They car got some 97' Lincoln's with booku
sound. 
You can hear us if we coming around it's best ya, get the right, kinda, disc, 
To. Listen to me. I want Mase and Teena Marie it's best ya, get a built, in
alarm 
Cause! I got me a gat and Imma drive to set the whole 3rd on the back, get it 
Rob who got it crank her up. It ain't your business who 
 
Stash your bundle. If you sittin' on the ramp, stash yo bundle if you dippin'
out the cut 
Stash. Your bundle, if you sittin' on the ramp, I'm always dressing shauve never
dressing 
Like, a champ 
 
I'm up early in the morning order breakfast smoking weed, I'm bout to go to
Ruby's and scoop 
A fresh pair of Marina's. I went on Dellashe' and dress mighty gentle. I said
Look at my snaps 
And bought another rental. I bought my lady to Nichols cause that was her
school 
Telling, all them 9th ward niggas that the 3rd ward rules. I walked her in the
school
