Dear Alicia Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.


Wassup' Alicia, nice to meet ya'.
My name is Twoiney, that's what they call me.
Your smile illustrious, it makes you gorgeous.
That's not what others think so I guess I'm a non-conformist.
Ya' booty big but is ya' heart enormous.
Ya' hot headed, that's something I can extinguish.
Ya' heart is shredded, I could never replace.
But a fly couldn't see what an eagle envisions.
Life is good, that's word to Nas.
Who hotter than us, that's word to Plies.
I wonder why other guys feed you lies.
Telling you that they love you just to get between your thighs.
Uhh, but fuck those guys never listen to lies.
They just wanna fuck and duck, but never there when you cry.
Dear Alicia, I'm glad I met 'cha.
I crave to get to know ya', not to sleep wit'cha.

Dear Alicia, I'm glad I met'cha.
I crave to get to know ya', not to sleep wit'cha.
Dear Alicia, this is not a game.
I'm including you in the picture, can't you see the frame.
Dear Alicia, this is from the heart.
I loved you at first sight, did Cupid hit me with a dart.
Dear Alicia, this is for you.
I never feel in love, but I'm in love with you.

With you, my love is true.
I'm on one knee Alicia, that mean I do.
Your old guy told a bold lie.
Just to sleep and creep on that bed where you lie.
I hear your cries, Alicia just wipe your eyes.
Ya' hurt deep inside, I think it's messing with your pride.
But what's next, just say fuck your ex.
And go for necks, so the scores can be tied.

Alicia my love for you is heavier than a ton.
And looking at you is a beautiful site like the setting of a sun.
To me, Alicia, you're the one.
Let's not talk about kids, but if we did I want you to have my precious.
daughter.
Or my precious little son, friend or foe.
No matter where you go, or who you may know.
This from me to you.
So you know it's true.
Sincerely, Twoiney Lo.
