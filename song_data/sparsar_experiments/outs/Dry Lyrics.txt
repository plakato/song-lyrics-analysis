Dry Lyrics
by Quill.

What I see before my eyes is a man that'll never be.
Wandering the freedom trail, don't let this man be me.
Wipe the dust from bloodstained skin but failing to stand tall.
Sit and watch the wise roll by, please save a wicked soul.

Searching high and low cause my spirit is moaning.
I'm on my way to higher ground.
All I need to know is where the water is flowing.
Before the well inside of me is running dry.

There is so much left to say no time for dying down.
I n this muddy waterhole one sip could make me drown.
Gimme strenght to carry on to waters rushing free.
Lay me out on fertile ground, somewhere I can be me.

If there's water flowing.
Fill me cause I'm running dry.
