\Life's A Bitch\ Lyrics
by TwonDon.


It go back then, when all I had was a pen/.
Full of dreams, so I let it bleed inside the margin/.
I was taught since 10 - never get out of line/.
Fist fought cause them thoughts will slip my mind/.
I'm out of time, and honestly this shit is getting realer/.
When your ex niggas turn drug-dealers to stack skrilla/.
It ain't worth it, you probably end up dead on that surface/.
Shot down on your own stage &amp; now it's closed curtains/.
No encore - let me just rewind dawg/.

We was average, that middle-class shit came with baggage/.
See them bills had to get paid before I can have it/.
I had it, I built a habit, and stuck too it like a magnet/.
And now I'm at it - my momma said you got a dream nigga better grab it/.
Tryna turn my lifestyle to everything imagined/.
That's living it lavish, from the hoes to the clothes it's different fabrics/.
The OG's know me, speaking on me like this kid is a savage/.
These niggas can't manage - I fully attack it/.
So don't dare to bother, cause how I spit is how she spit when she too scared.
to swallow/.
You feel me?, Cause on the really my niggas just gettin' by/.
They elevating they mind, just one too many times/.
That stress is leaving them blind, so they can't see the vision/.
Spending days writing on this page, I hope that you listen/.

They told me Life's A Bitch &amp; then you die, that's why we get high/.
AZ Cause you never know when you gonna go/ x4.

Look, my music speaking to any nigga with a dream that's seeking/.
And putting money to the side to cop new kicks this weekend/.
This shit is madness, cause over-time we develop a habit/.
Expensive taste, a lot of shit I want but can't have it/.
But fuck it. I know niggas that's living rugged/.
With they ribs touching, so they coming for them M's cousin/.
Ski-mask way - my cousin died the same way/.
But taking a life it wasn't okay, your daughter was born on the same day/.
This shit is wicked, cause all I got is my rhythm/.
But since a shorty, momma taught me how to make my decisions/.
So fuck your prisons, that shit ain't never been in my visions/.
Give it time with these line we gon stack our riches, youngin' so ambitious/.
Jot my name when they list it - down in history/.
I hope ya mention me, they gotta remember me/.
Like the back of they hand, see they know who I am/.
I skipped on school me and my crew &amp; we just built a brand/.
Until it's over flow colder then hatin' niggas shoulder/.
We bumpin' Hova wishing he could make our dreams closer/.
You see my placement, I wrote this shit in my momma's basement/.
We go and take it, fuck that waiting, niggas is losing patience/.
Little by little cause this all that we got/.
Give us the ball we'll score if you give us a shot/.
Whether you like it or not, just respect our vision/.
Spending days writing on this page, I hope that you listen/.
