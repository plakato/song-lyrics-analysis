California Lyrics
by Rusty.

I met her while in France.
We had a brief romance.
She rubbed my arm.
I rubbed her arm.
Then we dirty danced.
She moved down to L.A.
She met a dude o.k.
He sawed her head off with a knife.
Now she's gone away.
Hid away.
Hid away.
Hid away.
Went away.
California's nice.
It snowed there once or twice.
Bullets fly across the sky.
The path is smooth and tight.
I caught one at the bus stop.
I said hey man I've been shot.
I felt the warm blood rolling down.
Now it's gone away.
Hid away.
Hid away.
Hid away.
I met her while in France.
We had a brief romance.
She rubbed my arm.
I rubbed her arm.
Then we dirty danced.
She moved down to L.A.
She met a dude o.k.
He sawed her head off with a knife.
Now she's gone away.
Hid away.
Hid away.
Hid away.
