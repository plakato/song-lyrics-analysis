Confidence Lyrics

Baby you got confidence.
I love the way you talk that shit.
Baby you got confidence.
I love the way you talk that shit.

Trapstar University.
Gotta' minor in confidence.
Major in finessing.
The block gave her a scholarship.
Graduated in jail.
Her record is her diploma.
Only job offers is flippin' pussy or marijuana.
Or both.
But she don't wanna' do either.
She just want respect.
She just wanna be Aretha.
But she don't know how to get Franklins the legal way.
She doesn't believe that she can.
And that's when I say.

Baby you got confidence.
I love the way you talk that shit.
Baby you got confidence.
I love the way you talk that shit.

She picked up the violin.
She plays for money on the street now.
But she still flippin' keys 'bout every other week now.
Inbetween she still at the hotel posted.
Cause she a fiend for the money.
She gets her fix but feels broken.
Cause she knows she's livin' dirty.
Knows she gotta clean her life up.
Knew she needed grooming.
That's the reason why I wifed her.
But I had to leave.
She got pregnant.
Wasn't mine though.
Hopefully she hears from time to time though.

Baby you got confidence.
I love the way you talk that shit.
Baby you got confidence.
I love the way you talk that shit.

You that bitch and you know that shit yeah, you know that shit.
