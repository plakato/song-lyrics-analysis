Broke U Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


Like a ghost when I come through.
Anytime I will find you.
Going through trees, ain't no time to breathe.
Take your last breath and give it to me.
Pain in the air, watch you swallow the truth.
The same thing that's stolen your joy and your youth.
I can try to find it, but I can still see.
The fear in your eyes as you give it to me.
Not hard to sleep on a bed thorns.
Block it all out and you'll feel adorned.
The blood trickles down but your eyes still dry.
Creep in your sleep while you say goodbye.

I'm not sorry I broke you.
I won't try to lie, I still owed you.
You're not sorry you broke me.
Now we're not so hurt, now we're both free.
