Aint Going Home Lyrics
by Sway UK.


Came back from a place called fear and I will never ever lose my soul.
The radio plays loud I steer.
But I will never ever lose control.
We Ain't Going Home.

Sway time, and I'm back for like the 8th time.
Never thought I‘d deliver the goods?
Things take time.
Caesar of MC's you see a bunch of apes climbing through the trees.
For any promoter trying to cut my stage time.
The games dying it's sick.
So I came flying in six seconds.
Soon as I got the message through the grape Vine.
The grapevine, the grape, I make wine.
Out of the rumours you Hoovers should sip it suckers.
Great line.
The great lion of this UK rap, I'm like Aslan.
The kids are like ‘You came back?'.
I listen to their little albums like ‘Did you make that?'.
They like ‘yeah but you're here now, can you save rap?'.
Wait, clap.

Came back from a place called fear and I will never ever lose my soul.

The radio plays loud I steer.
But I will never ever lose control.

They ask me where we go from here?
Well the truth is ‘I just don't know?'.
Saying go home, go home, go home, go home.
Tell them that we Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.

This evening we ain't leaving the venue.
Even when the cleaners start sweeping we're singing with them too.
Redemption.
Don't ever let no industry end you.
Many may pretend to be your friend.
If they can't break you then they bend you.
They want every penny they lent you.
And just when the lights about to go out and the rents due.
You drop it on their heads and you make your best move.
Life will always test you my dissertation is my deliverance too.
They where scared that it won't chart.
But I'm a go further ‘long as I follow my own heart.
And I'm a go faster ‘long as I follow own path.
To be honest right now, I'm on some go home or go hard.
And I ain't going home.

Came back from a place called fear and I will never ever lose my soul.

The radio plays loud I steer.
But I will never ever lose control.

Mmm they ask me where we go from here?
Well the truth is ‘I just don't know?'.
Saying go home, go home, go home, go home.
Tell them that we Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.
Tell them that we Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.

It's Mr Bigz, the OG I'm on a bad boy ting.
‘Cause I shine in the club with my bad boy bling.
I'm notorious; you think you're a bad boy King?
Put the mase to his face watch that bad boy sing, WOH!
You see me, the sneaks bushimi.
On the boardwalk feeling like I'm Steve Buscemi.
You coming to slump me? I get my younger a pumpy.
I'm an old school G like Nucky or Lucky,.
The showman, porches' when we roll in.
Flow sharper than 47 logans.
I go darker than 47 omens.
47 shoguns, 47 Roland's.

Mmmmm They ask me where we go from here?
Well the truth is ‘I just don't know?'.
Saying go home, go home, go home, go home.
Tell them that we Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.

We Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.

Tell them that we Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.
Tell them that we Ain't Going Home.
We Ain't Going Home.
