Drinks On Me Lyrics
by Yungen.


She make it tick tock but I ain't got time to watch.
She be winding up 'til I clock and who am I to tell her to stop.
Catch me rolling through the hood, yeah they know my name on that block.
When we riding up we look ruthless cause we riding up in that drop.
Tell her drop it, drop it, brown girl, drop it.
Skin colour exotic.
If she's got a back tell her pop it.
If it looks fly then I'll rock it.
Two racks in my pocket.
Spent 5 bills on them True Religions, amen it's all profit.
Cause I work hard and I play hard.
Play Dirty 'til my graveyard.
No soft shit, we stay hard.
Ask the bar man, do you take card.
No birthday but my cake's large.
Tryna light my candles.
Instead of 6 feet I'm in Jamaica wearing sandals.

Man and we be spending money.
And we ain't tryna stunty.
Back so big you can see it from the fronty.
Never been a punk.
I've been rolling with that pump.
With some breddas that don't really give a funk.

Bottle after bottle, we be on a wave.
Spend it while I make it, I can't take it to my grave.
Them man there be stunting but we be getting paid.
Lightie in the corner I can see her through my shades.
Tell that girl them drinks on me, me, me.
Tell them man them drinks on me, me, me.
Bring your friends to VIP.
We gon' party properly.
I'm the star of the show, have everybody watching me.
Tell them girls them drinks on me, me.

Riding round through the city.
Tints up in the BM, with your BM and she tipsy.
The same man from the start are the same man that's fucking with me.
They're the same kids from knee high and I'll still give them a kidney.

Man I'm faded, I'm wasted, I'm verified, I'm rated.
Cause the music loud when I'm rolling and I've got Krept &amp; Kone in my.
playlist, we spending it like we made it.
Only family can relate it.
And that same girl who hated's in my bedroom and she's naked.
I'm on Grey Goose and cranberry or Disaronno and Coke.
Get a buzz off of living, I ain't never been one to smoke.
They be taking uhh, whatever floats your boat.
Working while I'm living man cause being broke is a joke.

Yeah, we be spending money.
But we ain't tryna stunty.
Back so big you can see it from the fronty.
Never been a punk.
I've been rolling with that pump.
With some breddas that don't really give a funk.

Bottle after bottle, we be on a wave.
Spend it while I make it, I can't take it to my grave.
Them man there be stunting but we be getting paid.
Lightie in the corner I can see her through my shades.
Tell that girl them drinks on me, me, me.
Tell them man them drinks on me, me, me.
Bring your friends to VIP.
We gon' party properly.
I'm the star of the show, have everybody watching me.
