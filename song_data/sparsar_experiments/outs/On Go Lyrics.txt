On Go Lyrics
by Zip K..


Get it out the mud never had a choice.
No one in my family ever ever had a Royce.
So i'm tryna be the first.
Catch a nigga slip my niggas hit um where it hurts.
Evil all around me got me feeling paranoid.
So this weapon Im concealing.
Its chilling in my shorts.
NFL, NBA, nigga pick a sport.
Tough call cause we always in the field and we never go to courts.
But we shootin if we gotta all my patnas tryna score.
If she ain't fuckin when I wanna then we gettin a divorce.
Alright okay.
It ain't trickin if u got it.
You ain't got it then it's force.
Green light.
Okay.
If my niggas got a mission.
Imma do it like chores.
Cause my palms steady itchin and this money is my cure.
It ain't shit in life certain but this shit right here for sure.

When the bread gets slow all my niggas on go.
All my niggas on go.
All my niggas know a lot bank roll got them bitches on go.
Keep them bitches on go.
Fuck nigga don't never try shit cause all my niggas on go.
All my niggas on go.
And wherever I go all my niggas gone go.
Cause all my niggas on go yeah yeah.
Go yeah yeah.
Go yeah yeah yeah.
Go yeah yeah x 2.
Where the commas come we go.
Where the drama come we go.
Go yeah yeah.
Go yeah yeah yeah.

They can get it any way they want it.
Tell them pussy niggas.
That the wait is over.
Niggas tried to play me.
Only made me colder.
Mom I swear you birthed a muthafuckin soldier.
Look I been ridin foreigns tell me how is yo Corolla.
I been speeding pass no way they can pull me over.
Look a nigga chiefin' gas no I'm loving the aroma.
Imma get some cash muthafucka know I wanna.
Stack it till it tower.
Right back in an hour.
Money is power now im in control.
Smashin on you cowards know the world is ours.
If you don't believe then just ask yo ho.
Fuck what you thought im the best and I know.
Been blessed from the go so it's best that you know.
Professional flow bitch his name is Pesos.
He not Mexican though.
Bitch he Phillipino.
He from the D though.
Live by the G code.
Fuck wit me though people at you peep hole.
King of the jungle cuz imma Leo.
And my niggas gorillas I keep um go.
If it ain't bout racks fuck you tellin me for.
Oh its bout a bag nigga tell me some more x2.
