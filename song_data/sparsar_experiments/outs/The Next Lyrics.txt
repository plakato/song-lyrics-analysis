The Next Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

Yo 6:45 January 19th.
Sitting in the basement, filing through some beats.
Hear about 4, then the lightbulb flicks.
What if in one day I did what god did in six?
That's when my brain starts racing.
No time to waste, with Pac as inspiration.
I pull out the iPhone and warm the thumbs up.
Bout to leave you dumbstruck, it's nose to the grindstone.
So they're saying I'm the next best.
Bet that changes soon cause they ain't even heard my best yet.
It's Makaveli maximized.
Masterful vision is actualized.
So don't act surprised when your mystified.
The arson of rap's back I'm mister fire.
High score and I ain't even use a multiplier.
Bomb squad so when the music is on dog.
I suggest you vacate the building like I missed the wire.
So it's time to move the show along.
And turn your speakers up cause when I'm here, you know it's on.
Lean back in your seat while I'm attacking the beat.
Kick your feet and grab something to eat.
In my skills you know I'm confident.
Can I do it in one day?
And still make it quality?
With that asked, I'm positive.
Sitting in the lab as I embark upon my journey.
Testing creativity, my one day hypothesis.
