Change The World Lyrics
by Ace Frehley.

And then I make wish 
I make it on eagle's wings 
And. When I say a prayer, 
I pray for peace, pray for peace, 
 
Nothing happens. If you don't try 
When nothing happens. That'S the reason why 
 
Hey, when I woke up today, 
I thought I could change the world 
Hey when I woke up today, 
 
And, when I look into the faces of children, 
I see perfect love 
And when I pray to my God in heaven. 
I pray for peace, pray for peace, 
 
Nothing happens. If you don't try 
When nothing happens. That'S the reason why 
 
Hey, when I woke up today, 
I thought I could change the world 
Hey. Oh, when I woke up today, 
 
La-La la-di-di-di-da. I think it's time for a change. 
When I was young I played. I had lots of fun 
But now I can see it's time for a change. 
The time is right. 
We got ta, put up a fight, 
And bring about some changes. 
 
When! I woke up today, 
I thought I could change the world 
When. I woke up today. 
I thought I could change the world 
When. I woke up today. 
I thought I could change the world 
When. I woke up today. 
I thought I could change the world 
 
When. I woke up today
