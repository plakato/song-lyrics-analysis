Take Me Down Lyrics
by Von Grey.

Da, da, da, da, da, da.
Oh, please let me be.
Da, da, da, da, da, da.
Cover my eyes so I can't see.
Lay down beside me.
Your hair forms a halo round your head.
Your tears they wash away my sin.
Wash away the sadness I bled.
Take me down, take me down.
Let me drown, let me drown.
Your mouth opened for a scream.
You couldn't make a sound.
I took the air from your lungs.
Mind tells you to move.
Your body can't obey.
I took your legs so you can't run.
Lay down beside me.
Your hair forms a halo round your head.
Your tears they wash away my sin.
Wash away the sadness I bled.
Take me down, take me down.
Let me drown, let me drown.
Ill take you down, take you down.
Let you drown, let you drown.
Oh, oh.
Your fingers laced crown.
We sit like kings.
As we slowly drift down.
Slowly drown.
Take me down, take me down.
Let me drown, let me drown.
Ill take you down, take you down.
Let you drown, let you drown.
