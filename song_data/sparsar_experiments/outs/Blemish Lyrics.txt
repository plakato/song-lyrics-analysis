Blemish Lyrics
by Voli.

Lyrics:.

Hey, hey, hey, mmm mmm mmm.

What a beautiful blemish, perfection of flesh.
Search party on her body, looking for the treasure chest.
Find me lost in a forest of skin, so lush.
Every crease, every mole is a crevice of lust.
And I love it.
All due to your blemish.

Oh my my my, oh my my my my.
Would you take a look at this art, just take a look at this art.
Oh my my my, oh my my my my.
Would you take a look at this art, just take a look at this art.

Hey, hey, hey.
What a beautiful blemish, every mark so pure.
Exhibit of a goddess, a gallery of curvature.
Every mark is a brush on a canvas of skin.
Every stroke is a sin but I've already lived up in heaven.
All due to your blemish.

Musical Interlude.

Oh woman of light.
Dem thing in your mind won't help you.
Oh woman, have sight.
I see what you blind yourself to.
Come here come here come here come here come here.
This should be my playground.
The glare, the glare, the glare, the glare of your shape make the sunset stay.
down.

Hey, hey, hey.
