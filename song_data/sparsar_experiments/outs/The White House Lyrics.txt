The White House Lyrics
by Ry.


If you want me to rap then just give me a bassline.
And sit back and relax and listen to Ray's rhymes.
We asking where the party at and we dont waste time.
I wouldn't waste yours so please don't waste mine.
Call Your people over, we can't turn up on facetime.
And if you wanna freestyle, there is a waitline.
You kill somebody's vibe just make sure that it ain't mine.
We don't have no drama, we won't end up on dateline.
And I just had a cup but somebody just drank mine.
I need some time to kill the rhymes, these rappers, they hate mine.
The rhymes ain't good then you know that they ain't mine.
We so turnt up we can't walk in a straight line.
And nine out of ten you ain't leaving here sober.
I'm asking turn down for what, I'll do that when I'm older.
Tell the girls twerk twerk twerk, just bend it over.
It's some bad girls outside that just pulled up in a rover.
And we go dumb my nigga mentally retarded.
A couple people couldn't make it ,we gone turn up regaurdless.
We turning up in outer space man, you know we some martians.
Its some drinks in the house and you know its some marley.
