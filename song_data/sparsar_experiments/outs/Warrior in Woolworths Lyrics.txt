Warrior in Woolworths Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

Warrior in woolworths.
Behind his serville innocence.
He's the rebel on the underground.
He plots and he schemes.
Humble he may seem.
She's the rebel of the modern town.
He's the rebel on the underground.
His roots are in today.
Warrior in woolworths.
She's the rebel of the modern town.
Doesn't know no history.
Warrior in woolworths.
He threw the past away.
Weapons rule their livesDips on friday nights.
Youths meet at stockwell tube.
