Back From Hell Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

D.M.C..
On the lower level where the devils dwell...
Comin from the one, comin back from hell.

{*Back.. - from the depths of hell - scratched by Jay*}.

Run.
Peepin out the window, checkin on the criminals.
Out in the yard, it's hard, but you're in.
So you do your time and never let the time do ya.
He lost his mind that's what the time'll do to ya.
A brother in the box screamin find a ciggarette.
Niggas walkin by ain't tryin to hear that.
So off to the Day Room, a fight in progress.
A brother got sliced and diced over nonsense.
D.O.I., Dead On the Island.
The life the knife the price, for wigga-wildin.
Never a day, I say I'm not leavin.
Long as I live in a crib and I'm breathin.
Four years done, another one in a cell.
Don't need nobody to come, cause I'll be back from hell.

{*Back.. - from the depths of hell - scratched by Jay*}.

D.M.C..
Fire and brimstone, sendin 'em home.
To the brownstone, and on the streets that he roamed.
Before he got locked up, he sewed the whole block up.
People would jock, because he cooked the rock.
Caught by the cop, he's knocked, and now he's faceless.
The spot was hot, he's Scott, that's what his name is.
When he was out with clout, people surround him.
Now that he's in the pen, niggas downed him.
Wait upstate, for the day, til they free the man.
In '98, be straight, and then you'll see him again.
Ready to kill, and steal, ill and build.
A flyer empire, higher, still runnin the 'ville.

{*Back.. - from the depths of hell - scratched by Jay*}.

Run.
Boy goin to hell, another day in the dark.
The brother wait in the park, blind faded and stalked.
Naked, out to die and not movin.
He needs a fix by six that means you've been.
Strung out, your lung out, foamin with your tongue out.
Back to hell and well, that's where you hung out.
For the past and last year, your acts for cash here.
Crash and smash any ass to get a blast yeah.
The brother smother his mother, for another one.
Then ill and kill, with the other son.
For crack as well, the brother black he yell.
You just stop and think, he's comin back from hell.

{*Back.. - from the depths of hell - scratched by Jay*}.

.. from the depths of hell and you can smell the smoke!
