Twenty Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

I guess there was a time.
When I didn't know you.
And I guess that time.
Was pretty much my whole life.
Even though I don't like.
Thinking about it.
Because everything now.
Feels totally right.

Eighteen years.
Twenty miles apart.
River like an ocean.
That we couldn't cross.
But rivers can't.
Demagnetize hearts.
Yeah we're making up.
For the time that we lost.

Everything's perfect.
It all feels fateful.
But i don't believe in fate.
I just believe in people.
But even if there's no destiny.
I'm glad you ended up with me.
Ended up with me.
