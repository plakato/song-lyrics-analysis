You'll Be Your Star Lyrics
by Quelle Chris.

Spoken word: Jimetta Rose.

We run for our dreams.
Single-mindedly, one focus.
Eyes upon the goal.
Watching our stories get told.
But who is the artist.
Without it's audience?
The sweetness of a melody.
With no ears to hear.
No crowds to cheer?
When you found your way.
To such great extraordinary heights.
Where you found your life.
And saw it reflected back to you a million times.
From people, places, and things.
You found this brighter way of being.
Connected to all.
We got so much work to do in this time of the fall.
Who's going to be there in the end?
Might be stranger, might be friend, might be love.
Standing with open arms ready to embrace you.
Ready to lift you up and be itself lifted in you.
Be itself lifted in you, be itself made new.
Ready to expand, to grow, to shine.
Across galaxies of empty rooms.
You're still beautiful.
You see your reflection all around.
