Yam And Choffi Lyrics
by Twi Teacher.


Even if you give me Snap, Crackle &amp; Pop.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Even if it's Finger Licking Good.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
If your house is home of the whopper.
I said I will eat.

Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Ronald has a tune saying.
I said I will eat.

Jaime Oliver check, I don't.
understand you.
When you do your cooking.
All you make is salad.
There is lots of meat, but you ignore.
You are hungry but you won't say.
I've invited you to the chop bar but you don't come.
I've said it so many times, but you don't change.
I went to Nando's and queued up, waited long.
I took their pamphlet opened and looked.
Just dead chicken and some perry perry.
I've gone to cleaning &amp; I'm feeling hungry heavy.
I thought the Nan in Do's, was for Nana.
But it's not Nana, It's carlos's dad.
It was advertised on TV that people should come &amp; buy.
But when I went, they did't have common Shitto.

Even if you give me Snap, Crackle &amp; Pop.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Even if it's Finger Licking Good.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
If your house is home of the whopper.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Ronald has a tune saying.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.

Jss 3 students, what is the F word.
Is it only adults who can eat his food?
I'm on about Gordon Ramsay.
His food is clumsy.
His banku is lumpy.
Just like Sherman Klump.
His pricing is obese.
One day I met him in soho.
That time his book was on promo.
It came on national TV that people should come &amp; buy.
But when I went, they did't have common Shitto.

Even if you give me Snap, Crackle &amp; Pop.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Even if it's Finger Licking Good.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
If your house is home of the whopper.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
Ronald has a tune saying.
I said I will eat.
Yam &amp; Choffi.
