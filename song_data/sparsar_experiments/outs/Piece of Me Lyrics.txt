Piece of Me Lyrics
by The Word Alive.


Everybody's gotta lose someone.
No matter who you call your own.
They gotta choose someone to love.

And no matter how far away they feel.
You'll always feel like someone's here.
I never thought I'd reach the bottom.
I always thought that you'd be there.

Without you here.
Everything feels so clear.
And I can't let you go.
How could I sink so low.
How could I sink so low.

Owning up to mistakes I've made.
Right back to where I started.
Reflecting all your tears.
I got lost in my ego.

And no matter how far away you feel.
I always feel like you're right there.
I never thought I'd reach the bottom.
Until you disappeared.

Without you here.
Everything feels so clear.
And I can't let you go.
How could I sink so low.
How could I sink so low.

Every time we collide.
I will fall and stumble forward.
In my home with you.
Every time we collide.
I will fall and stumble forward.
In my home with you.
With you, with you.
With you, with you.

Without you here.
Everything feels so clear.
And I can't let you go.
How could I sink so low.
How could I sink so low.
