Youre Always On My Mind Lyrics
by SWV.

You're always on my mind 4x.

Coko.
Boy, I can't seem to get you outta my head.
But there's something about you that makes me smile.
Don't change, I like the way you make me feel.
Can we take our time and do this for a while.
Brian Morgan.
Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me.
Now, you're the only one I want in my life.
And the special touch you give comes from you only.
I guess that's why you're always on my mind.

You're always on my mind.
You're always on my mind.
You're always on my mind.
You're always on my mind.

Coko.
Sometimes, I find it hard to concentrate.
Because thoughts of us together fill my head.
When you're away, it's hard to sleep at night.
So, my pillow, like my thoughts of you, I hold tight.
Brian Morgan.
Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me.
Now, you're the only one I want in my life.
And the special tough you give comes from you only.
I guess that's why you're always on my mind.

Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya, I can't stop thinking 'bout ya.
