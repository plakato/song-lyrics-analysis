Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Man, that's what I'm tal'n bout right there.
They say this what it take to wrote songs like this, come on let's go.
Oh what you thinking huh, yeah you right.
I see ya, let's go.

Yung Ro.
A young mother got kids, growing up on her own.
And her baby daddy gone, so she all alone.
And even though we was po', we had a good life.
Wasn't changing for the world, cause I love the hood life right.
You shoulda seen, Lil' Ro.
Flat top with a part, borrowing sugar from next do'.
But oh the rent's due, plus you got money to pay back.
The others lent you, and what's this letter that they sent you.
Talking bout we pass due, pass out.
And what's eviction mean mama, I don't wanna leave the house.
Boy go and shut your mouth, we gon do what we gonna.
To make it and we did, I got no choice to love mama.
And I know, you think nobody cares.
Nobody tries like you, and nobody's there.
But you right, because it's me and you.
So when you think nobody cares, you know who to look to ya know.

Nobody knows the, trouble that I've seen.
No-body knows my, sorrow.

Yung Ro.
Nobody knows my sorrow, it's like my heart seems hollow.
But think about it, it really woulda took a right tomorrow.
I got a heart mayn, that's bigger than me.
But sometimes I can't decide, between this trigger and me.
It's like it's bigger than me, I got a nigga in me.
That's both bitter but sweet, and he be hitting that sweet.
Get in the street, and just won't listen to me.
I'm on some soul searching, trying to find the middle of me.
Listen to me, it get hard everyday.
I talk to God and I pray, and I just talk and I say.
Whatever on my mind and heart, I'm trying to find my start.
Ready to go, but I can't find my part.
I grind and walk, because patience is a virtue.
I'm speaking from experience, running fast will hurt you.
Plus nobody will help, that's why we named our crew.
And don't nobody cares, and know who to look to for real.

You gotta smile, through it all though man.
You can't let that shit, get you down man.
Hard times, come for a reason.
Smile, and stick together.
