XIII Lyrics
by Sworn In.

I've built myself a stage to plea.
The curtains closed, it's only me.
It's only me to beg and to plead.
Left for dead and left to bleed.
Thirteen struck dead, unlucky at best.
I'll never rest, in hell I'm just a guest.
So listen closely because I'll only say.
it once before departing.
When the show ends it's really only starting.
