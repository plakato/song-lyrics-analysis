Airheads Lyrics
by Sweet.

Annabel was seventeen.
Prettirest thing that you've ever seen.
Worked real hard for a supermarket chain.
Then two young dudes in a limousine.
Said 'You'd look real cute in a magazine'.
From that day things would never be the same.
She's a kitten on the catwalk.
Shouting it out loud.
Strutting with her head up in the clouds.
Airheads, living out the dream.
In glossy magazines for girls and boys.
Airheads, nothing in between.
Empty boxes making lots of noise.
Ok! Hello!
Gotta get upI gotta go.
Paris, London, Tokio, New York.
She was front-page news on the Daily Blah.
Kiss and tell with a superstar.
Someone should have told her not to talk.
Yesterday she ran away.
From the paparazzi lens.
Is that the way to make new friends.
Airheads, living out the dream.
In glossy magazines for girls and boys.
Airheads, nothing in between.
Empty boxes making lots of noise.
She's young, she's just having fun.
So just let it be.
She's just a fox on the run.
Airheads, living out the dream.
In glossy magazines for girls and boys.
Airheads, nothing in between.
Empty boxes making lots of noise.
