Am I Right Lyrics
by Xperience.


Am I right.
Am I wong.
Am I weak or strong.
Can't you see I am burning alive.
Hold me tight trough the night.
And I feel alright.
And I know I am right.
I met you once when the sun came up.
The road to nowhere.
When I had a rest.
I met you once where the river flows.
From the hills of the east to the west.

You came to me and I turned to you.
You spoke to me like a man should do.
I caught a glance of a burning eye.
And I knew that my dreams will come true.

I know I am right.
