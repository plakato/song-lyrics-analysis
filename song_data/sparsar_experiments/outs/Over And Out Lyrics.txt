Over And Out Lyrics
by The Swellers.

You were there from the beginning.
It was then we said.
We'd have each other backs forever.
Our days were never numbered.
We were all best friends.
We always thought that we were never ending.
Then things started changing.
You said it wasn't right.
For you to keep excuses coming.
Put out the flame you started.
I should have known it all along.
I knew you'd never be the same.
If you left even for a while.

I know you're leaving for a reason.
But I don't understand what you're thinking.
It's way over my head, again.

We could have kept it going.
But you dropped it all.
You gave up all you ever dreamed of.
There's no going back now.
You fit me like a glove.
But now I'm not sure any glove will fit this time around.
Cause you always looked more blissful in the shade.
Now I see the other face.

I know you're leaving for a reason.
But I don't understand what you're thinking.
It's way over my head, again.

You know it's different now that you're gone.
Maybe it's for the best.
You probably thought you were the only one.

I know you're leaving for a reason.
But I don't understand what you're thinking.
It's way over my head, again.
You know I'd love to know what you found.
Be sure to drop me a line.
Or maybe I'll see you around.
