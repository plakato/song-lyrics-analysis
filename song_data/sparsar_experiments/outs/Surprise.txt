Surprise
by The Wrens.

Cut a killing path / through the true west.
Dozens laid rest / settled down then at last.
Thought i might be done / but being good made me burst.
The killing got worse / it almost got fun / so i got a new gun.
Marie came home tattooed / it covers her back.
It's God done in black / says it protects me from you.
As christmas can be / i started out fine.
I used to kill time / now Detroit's killing me / so i jump start my spree.
Surprise / it's not enough / want to work / influence on rock's and shells and.
dirt.
Looks like you need a man time, honey comb.
Hid away for wine years how you've grown.
We can call your folks / from a highway side rotary.
I drive up to your door / and wracked by disease.
I do what i please / drop you to the floor.
On top of magazines / and calendar art.
Held up with darts / shows american scenes / of cowboys in jeans.
I'll change / his scrape of land / i'll take you east / we'll guide the first.
we find to sleepy peace.
Pop the door i think this wander lust.
Ain't the only thing between both of us.
I'll make you famous / and we'll double the states you've seen.
The cop who brought me in / an uncle of mine.
On first mommy's side / i'm even named after him.
