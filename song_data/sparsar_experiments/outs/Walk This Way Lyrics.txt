Run 
Now, there's a backseat lover, 
that's, always undercover 
And. We talk'til my daddy, say 
Said. You ain't seen nothing ,'til you're down on a muffin, 
And, there's sure to be a change in ways: 
Now, there's a cheerleader! That'S a real big breeder 
As far as I can reminisce 
But. The best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin 
And. It started with a little kiss like this 
 
 { *Joe Perry plays guitar riff* } 
 
D.M.C. w/ Steven Tyler in background 
See-saw swinging with the boys in school. 
And. Her feet are just fly up in the air: 
Singing, Hey diddle diddle, with a kitty in the middle 
And they swinging like it just didn't care 
So. I took a big chance At the high school dance 
With, a lady who was ready to play. 
It. Wasn'T me she was foolin' 
Cause. She knew what was she was doin' 
When. She told me how to walk this way. 
 
Walk this way 
Talk this way 
Walk this way 
Talk this way 
Walk this way 
Talk this way 
Walk this way 
Talk this way, 
Well just gim me a kiss 
 
 { *Joe Perry plays guitar riff* } 
Oooh, like this 
 
Run w/ Steven Tyler. In background 
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy 
Little skirt, climbing way up her knee 
It was three young. Ladies in the school gym, locker 
And they find they were looking at D. 
I was high. School loser never made it with a lady 
'Til, a boy told me something I missed 
That my next door neighbor had a daughter had a favor 
So. I gave the girl a little kiss like this 
 
Run-D.M.C. Steven Tyler and Rick Rubin 
See-saw swinging with the boys. In the school 
With her feet, flying up in the air, 
Singing, Hey diddle diddle, with a kitty in the middle 
I, was swinging. Like I didn't care 
So, I took a big chance at the high school dance 
With, a lady who was ready to play. 
Wasn'T me. She was foolin' 
When. She knew what she was doin' 
When. She told me how to walk this way.
