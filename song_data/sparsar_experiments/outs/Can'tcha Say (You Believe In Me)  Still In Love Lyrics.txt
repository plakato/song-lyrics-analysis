Can'tcha Say (You Believe In Me)  Still In Love Lyrics
by Boston.

Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can'tcha see what you mean to me?

Everyday I think of you.
You're on my mind.
Some things in the past.
Are better left behind.
Every night I dream of you.
The images as clear as day.

Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
You know that where there's a will there's a way.
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can't you see what it means to me?
Don't leave me alone tonight.
Cause I still love you.

We've had our time apart.
And I knew right from the start.
I could never change.
The way I feel about you baby.
We can sit here all night long.
And separate the right from wrong.
But love won't wait.

Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
You know that where there's a will there's a way.
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can't you see what it means to me?
Don't leave me alone tonight.
Cause I still love you.
