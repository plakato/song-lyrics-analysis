Overlord Lyrics
by VNCHY.


Have, you ever met the overlord 
VNCHY a villain. Every time the boy records 
It's like a bomb deploys 
A hot nigga, but my neck be froze 
A hot nigga like the Devil's boys 
Yet, I'm the better choice: yeah 
Get, her moist. When I use the voice shit. 
I'M, a tutor boy, 
Taught her everything and you ain't know it 
Against all odds. I don't trip. I got a team of Gods. 
She won't hesitate to fuck. If I give the nod, 
I told her baby better. Do a good, fucking job 
Cuz see these hoes out here, always trying to rob 
My attention. I told them. I learned my lesson: 
It's, both a curse and a blessing 
Heard, I'm a lethal weapon 
Don't get the wrong impression, but 
 
The youngest out the city'bout to make it hot 
Yeah. They say we headed to the top 
She asked me: who are you and what are you about 
I told her bitch? Have you ever met the overlord 
 
Bitch? Have you ever met the overlord 
 
You? Don'T want beef like its Ramadan 

Known as the north's own phenomenon. 
Making big king moves, yet you remain a pawn. 
Life is but a game. The only difference how the board is drawn, 
Take a risk and lose your life. Please don't get involved 
Broke out the cocoon to later fly. Guess my game evolved 
And! You ain't, even wonder why your whole clique been soft 
Niggas lost talking through their teeth like they dental floss 
My style tends to intimidate foes. 
Them folks revoke all jokes from you comical hoes 
'Cuz, you funny to begin with hard to even deal with 
I'm Bruce Lee on the grind. So niggas thought i could kick flip 
He's sick since 9-5. Winning has been an instinct 
It. Ain'T no surprise like blacks within a precinct, 
Killer mentality. Do it all with no subtleties 
In good shape from running your city. 
I'M, burning calories, dawg,
