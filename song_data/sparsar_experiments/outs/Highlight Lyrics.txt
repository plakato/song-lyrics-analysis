Highlight Lyrics
by Rufus.

Day to day.
You're the hi ... highlight.
Day to day.
You're the hi ... highlight.

You're the bright side of my darkness.
You remove my gloom.
You picked me up when times got rough.
I'm glad you had some room.
To love and hold me close to your heat.
To keep me safe and warm.
You're the height of my desire.
You set off my alarm.

Day to day.
You're the hi ... highlight.
Day to day.
You're the hi ... highlight.

I can't wait to see you.
From one moment to the next.
With you I never know what new thrill to expect.
Your perfect sense of timing.
Keeps me coming back for more.
You're the spark that lights my fire.
It's you that I adore.

Day to day.
You're the hi ... highlight.
Day to day.
You're the hi ... highlight.
