A Moment In Time Lyrics
by The Zombies.

All my beginnings.
That preciously I find.
Lead me to sorrow.
Or happiness incline.
Love is the answer.
No question in my mind.
Some things will always remain.

Some times I stumble.
And try to have it all.
Let me be reckless.
But catch me when I fall.
The longest journey.
Still has to have a start.
Let me reach out with my heart.

Like a rolling cloud.
It leaves me blind.
Feeling for the breath of angels.
Trying to find that crooked line.
To this moment in time.

Look in the mirror.
There's nothing that I see.
A ghostly illusion.
Is staring back at me.
Life is a stage where.
We all just act a part.
Let me reach out with my heart.

Like a rolling cloud.
It leaves me blind.
Reaching for the taste of freedom.
Let me find that crooked line.
To this moment in time.
