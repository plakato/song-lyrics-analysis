Shigo (After Death) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


I'm in the house, smoking, oh me.
It's only me and its so lonely,.
Everybody fucks with me,.
I walk outside and I'm still lonely.

I'm in the world but nobody can see me.
I'm in the clouds...lonely.
Im smoking weed and its all for me.
I got some green and it's all for me.
I'm with this girl and she's all on me.
She got acid and LSD.
All for me.
Owe her some if you talking to me.
Nigga, I need some more money.
Twenty dollars and its just on me.
I gotta make it stretch all damn week.
Oh....

I'm holding on to the thought of you.
I'm more than gone, it's nothing new.
I'm running round, I'm getting cash.
I'm flicking ash, I'm getting assets.
See your girlfriend tell you that she not but.
But she with me, she with the team and we smoking good.
We blowing o's and febreze like we know we should.
I don't give a fuck, never really did.
Dropped out of school, didn't give a shit.
My parents probably hate me, but I don't give a shit.
My daddy wishing I had stayed in fucking school.
And my momma fucking wish that I had never been a fool, but....

I'm a young white fuck, in the end, so, you really can't change that, so,.
sorry. I don't give a fuck if you don't understand what I just said. That.
shit's just for me. SESH.
