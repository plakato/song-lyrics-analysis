Holl Up Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


Hol' up we on Robatus' 
We up in the lane 22's on buck, 
Texas wreckless iced out necklace 
This is how we do it now. Who'S got plex 
, 
A3 
Boom, who am I I'm the Tanker 
Everyday all day got ta, keep it gangsta 
Down in the Dirty 3rd, where the boys play ya. 
Jumped out the wide body to the Navigator. 
Just got the Escalade stretched. Making million dollar bets 
Eddy got my candy looking dripping-dripping wet 
I ain't tripping, never caught slipping 
In, the fo-do' lane, switching yeah, I'm dipping 
Hop and I'm skipping, yellow broad pimping, 
Jumped out starched jeans J's and I'm limping 
Flossing in Austin Dallas Laffeyette 
ATL Arkansas Mississippi keep Screw up in they deck 
 
Mike Jones 
I got 22's and up on my car and truck 
Even, though I'm behind tint, you still see my princess cuts. 
Because, I hit the block and I grind daily. That'S why I've been shining lately 
No time to wine baby. If you wan na shine baby 
22's when I roll up big dollar signs, I'ma fold up 
That real drank I'ma po' up in seven months, I blowed up 
Wreckshop-Swishahouse. When we talk close your mouth 
Major without a major deal, we the hottest in the South 
If. It ain't purple stuff, don't put it in my cup 
When, Who Is Mike Jones drop I'ma sew the game up 
No time to play around. I hit the lab and I lay it down. 
I open, mouth platinum, smile cause. I got the platinum, sound, 
, 
Big Moe 
I'm fly like an eagle eagle 
Flossing down when burning mayn wood grain be sturning, mayn 
I'm, a G like that. You know a nigga named Big Moe 
I'm crawling down slow, I'm down on tippie-toe 
Rolling down on big car. I'M sipping on big bar 
I'm thinking, manage-tois Moe-Yo thinking going far 
In this rap game mayn smoking on Mary, Jane 
Talking down mayn, I'm for my name, mayn 
I'm that nigga Big M-O-E from the hood yeah 1-2-3 
I'm, letting you know you can't talk down. Ain'T no plex with me: 
I'm balling, mayn chop-chop, when I'm crawling mayn 
Never nigga be stalling. Mayn Moe-Yo, I be crawling mayn 
 
D-Gotti 
Sitting fly like the Mag-wood wheeling my Lac, 
The hood feeling the G-shit Gotti spit up on tracks, 
Cause uh. Just the other day. I slung right up a pay 
Cause see what gutter gain now I'm'bout to run the game. 
Throwed delay you holding grey I'ma po', the drank boys, know the name 
D-Gotti one in the big old body, with the big old shotty. Just ain't gon change, 
18's on bang beam on breaks on the Bulo' 
If it ain't do-do. You could shove it up your culo 
Kicking it like Judo Kool-Aid'ing in the hood 
Jacob ticking ice glistening, you hating, we good 
And. I wish a nigga would look like he wan na take some'ing 
Keep the tool for them crooks. A gangsta got ta pack, some'ing 
Lac bumping head black woman with me: 
I'm sipping. She sipping, we tipsy, she finished 
And. I do it how it's pose to go. You know us 
If, you can't relate then hoooool' up,
