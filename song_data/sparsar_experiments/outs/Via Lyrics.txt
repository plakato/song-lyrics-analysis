Via Lyrics
by Volumes.

Write me off, I'm going south for the year.
So take me there, off the map.
That no one else could scale.
You sat me down, showed me the aeriels that resonate the skies.
In between the visual lines, encompassing pines.
In the greenery commons.
Is it pressed in a book.
A history unknown.
An isle of concentrated mineral.
In elapsed time.
Directions to locate the fountain of karats.
The sight of gold.

They sat me down on a point.
And my eyes looked up in texture.
The illuminating brim.
A solid trilogy circle.
Embedded in the rock orbital.
When I'm gone you know where you find me: here.

It was immaculate in its beauty.
A thousand words could never describe the colored brights.
Forever, to a shore.
Where you can dig the earth and let it run through your hands.
As deep as it will glow.
We savored the last hour with the turning of the sun.

A visual shrine.
Existing with electronic lines.
An inseparable sign.
Intertwined with the corkscrewed.
Manifested woman.
In front of me, toxicity.
In front of me, she barely stood.
Take me there.

It was immaculate in its beauty a thousand words.
Could never describe the colored brights.
Forever, to a shore.
