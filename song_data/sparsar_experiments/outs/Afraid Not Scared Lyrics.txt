Afraid Not Scared Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Look at this ocean with everyone drowning.
Idiots screaming and everyone sinking in slowly.
We're surrounded.
In the yellow lights of the city wasted as bodies.
In bed with somebody a touch away with nothing to do.
We're surrounded.
I'm really dying here.
I'm really dying here.
And I'm afraid, no I'm scared.

She started freezing, lungs all collapsing.
The momentum is passing, but the moment is eating us whole.
We're surrounded.
Put the guns in the water, they're turning to vodka.
Triggering nothing we're sinking the sea takes the ship.
And I'm really dying in here.
I'm really dying in here.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid. No, I'm scared. No I'm scared.
I'm just scared. Just let me down.

I'm getting really cold and I'm looking at you.
You're not moving.
I'm getting really cold and I'm looking at you.
You're not moving.
I'm getting really cold and I'm looking at you.
And you're not moving.
