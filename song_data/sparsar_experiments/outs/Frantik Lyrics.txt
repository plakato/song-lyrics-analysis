Frantik Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

Too many times I focus on myself.
Look to the inside and all the times I fail.
But I look at You and Your face.
I'm in Your arms and the failing's pale.
I'm insignificant but all You've done in my life.
To save and change me.
I wanna give my whole life to worship.
Own my words and deeds completely.
I wanna tell that my Dad the Creator.

Looks up the mountains captured my love.
It's immense and so close I can't comprehend.

When I come into the presence of God.
I come to worship the Maker of all things.
King of love, awesome Saviour of the world.
Do you believe it?
Do you believe it?
Do you believe it?

Well go frantik.
Everyone in the place get frantik.
Jump up in the air get hectic.
With your hands shout out.
Accept it.
To the glory of God it's frantik.
Everyone in the place go frantik.
Jump up in the air get hectic.
With you hands shout out.
Accept it.
To the glory of God.

It's frantik.
Go frantik.
Get hectic.
Head beats noddin' and your feet's electric.

It's frantik.
Go frantik.
Get hectic.
Head beats noddin' and your feet's electric.

Frantik.
Go frantik.
Get hectic.
Frantik go frantik go frantik go frantik go frantik go frantik go frantik.
Go frantik go.

When I survey the wonderous Cross.
To which my Saviour Jesus hangs there nailed.
I never cease to be humbled by Your love.
And all my words of praise seem frail.
Stiil Your hands of peace are all I need.
And Your grace poured out lifts up my soul.
As I wait on the Lord.
He renews my strength.
As I call on the Lord He makes me whole.
I intend to sing of this amazing thing that has happened to me in.
These days.
Overwhelmed by the love of Jesus.
I wanna worship.
I wanna shout out praise.

When I come into the presence of God.
I come to worship the Maker of all things.
King of love, awesome Saviour of the world.
Do you believe it?
Do you believe it?
Do you believe it?

Well go frantik.
Everyone in the place get frantik.
Jump up in the air get hectic.
With your hands shout out.
Accept it.
To the glory of God it's frantik.
Everyone in the place go frantik.
Jump up in the air get hectic.
With you hands shout out.
Accept it.
To the glory of God.
Go frantik.
Everyone in the place get frantik.
Jump up in the air get hectic.
With your hands shout out.
Accept it.
To the glory of God it's frantik.
Everybody in the place go frantik.
Jump up in the air get hectic.
With you hands shout out.
Accept it.
To the glory of God.

It's frantik.
Go frantik.
Get hectic.
Head beats noddin' and your feet's electric.
Frantik.

Head beats noddin' and your feet's electric.

Frantik.
