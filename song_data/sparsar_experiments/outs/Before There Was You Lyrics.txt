Before There Was You Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


A church with no voices raised.
Singing loud in heavenly praise.
Is just four walls 'round a silent room.
That was me before there was you.
A ship with no guiding star.
Aimlessly drifting near and far.
With no harbor to sail into.
That was me before there was you.

That was me before there was you.
The last dark cloud in a sky of blue.
On a lonesome wind just passing through.
That was me before there was you.

A world where darkness fell.
Like a coin down an empty rail.
Where no wish had ever come true.
That was me before there was you.

Oh, that was me before there was you.
