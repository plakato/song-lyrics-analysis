Lies Lyrics
by The Undead.


Lies, lies.
Your telling me that you'll be true.
Lies, lies.
That's all I get from you.
Tears, tears.
I shed a million tears for you.
Tears, tears.
And now you're loving someone new.
Someday I'm gonna be happy.
But I don't know when just now.
Lies, breakin' my heart.
You think that you're such a smart girl.
And I'll believe what you say.
But who do you think you are girl.
To lead me on this way, hey.
Lies, lies.
I can't believe a word you say.
Lies, lies.
I'm gonna make you sad someday.
Someday you're gonna be lonely.
But you won't find me around.
Lies, breakin' my heart.
Someday I'm gonna be happy.
But I don't know when just now.
Lies, breakin' my heart.
You think that you're such a smart girl.
And I'll believe what you say.
But who do you think you are girl.
To lead me on this way, hey.
Lies, lies.
I can't believe a word you say.
Lies, lies.
I'm gonna make you sad someday.
Someday you're gonna be lonely.
But you won't find me around.
Lies, breakin' my heart.
Breakin' my heart.
Breakin' my heart.
Breakin' my heart.
