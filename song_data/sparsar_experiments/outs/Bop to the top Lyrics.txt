Ryan:.
Mirame.

Sharpay:.
I believe in dreaming.
And shooting for the stars.

Ryan:.
Baby to be number one.
You got to raise the bar.

Sharpay:.
Kicking and a scratching.
Grinding out my best.

Ryan:.
Anything it takes to climb.
The ladder of success.

Both:.
Work our tails off everyday.
Gotta bump the competition.
Blow them all away.

Ryan:.
Caliente.

Sharpay:.
Suave.

Sharpay:.
Yeah we're gonna.

Both:.
Bop bop bop, bop to the top.
Slip and slide and ride that rythm.

Ryan:.
Jump and hop.
Hop until we drop.

Sharpay:.
And start again.
Zip zap zop hop, flop like a mop.

Ryan:.
Scoot around the corner.
Move it to the groove.
Until the music stops.

Both:.
Do the bop bop bop.
To the top.
Don't ever stop.
Bop to the top.
Gimme gimme.
Shimmy shimmy.
Shake some booty and turn around.
Flash a smile in their direction.

Sharpay:.
Show some muscle.

Ryan:.
Do the hustle.

Sharpay:.
Yeah we're gonna.

Both:.
Bop bop bop, bop to the top.

Ryan:.
Wipe away your inhibitions.

Both:.
Stump stump stump, do the rump.

Sharpay:.
And strut your stuff.

Both:.
Bop bop bop, straight to the top.
We're going for the glory.

Ryan:.
We'll keep stepping up and we just won't stop.

Sharpay: stop.

Both:.
Till we reach the top.
Bop to the top.
