Club Paradise Remix Lyrics
by Unique B..


At this point, I'm the guy who doubts himself and afraid to listen to his.
music.
A lot of people say that they're glad that I'm young and doing it.
Cuz no foolishness, they wish they were my age.
Cuz by the time I'm their age, I'll probably be on big stages.
Lack of confidence. Big ego.
Contradictory phrases make go.
Oxymoronic on that.
chronic nonsleeping phase.
Where I'm up for days, til I fall dismayed.
You said you were venting, you were spreading rumors.
There's a graph full of winners I'm that outlier loser.
I'm also a hero, the kind you call super.
Secret identity, whoever knew it?
Can you believe Club Paradise is a strip club.
Man I'm only 15, I never been to one.

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind.
You think I'm so caught up in where I am rightnow.
But believe I remember it all.

I'm doing what I love.
Hopefully you know it.
I'm looking to the future.
But I'm stuck in the moment.
All of my opponents they all gotta recognize.
Im the next up.
So they all gotta step aside.
Let em snooze.
I'mma let em rest they eyes.
Let em sleep.
Guaranteed they gon see me in theyre dreams.
Look.
And most of all I'm not looking for a handout.
I'm with my team.
Never yelling out man down.
I'm asking for a chance.
Will you give it to me?
Or keep doubting me.
And straight pissing on me.
It doesn't make a difference.
A decision.
Yes I admit it.
Believe it, I admit.
Dealt with me in the worst way.
Why would I come back to the city I never left in the first place?
Yeah that's the TDot.
Ill till we spots.
Repoint Canada.
Just showing em what we got.
