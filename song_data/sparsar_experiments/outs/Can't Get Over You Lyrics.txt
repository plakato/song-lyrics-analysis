Can't Get Over You Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

Now I shouldn't give you one more chance.
But my heart just stopped when you asked me to dance.
And I know that you hurt me so.
But I love you so much I just can't let you go.
All my friends say they think I'm crazy.
But when I'm with you my mind is hazy, ah-ah-ah, oh no.

I can't, I can't, I can't get over you.
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you.

Say you love me and you won't tell a lie.
But then bright the next day you tell me goodbye.
And I know that you hurt my pride.
But keep loving me baby just stay by my side.
Yeah, I know that I'm being dumb.
But when I'm with you my heart is thumping, ah-ah-ah, oh no.

I can't, I can't, I can't get over you.
I can't, I can't, I can't get over you.
I can't, I can't, can't get over you.
I can't, I can't, can't get over you.

So you wanna make time for cheating.
Cause I can't stop my heart from beating, ah-ah-ah, oh no.
You're so messed up, it's making me crazy, ah-ah-ah, oh no.

I can't, I can't, can't get over you.
I can't, I can't, can't get over you.
I can't, I can't, can't get over you.
I can't, I can't, can't get over you.
