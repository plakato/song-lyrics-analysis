Fast Lane Lyrics
by Q'Raun.


You'Re, my drug
Tell me how the fuck you feel
Tell me how the fuck you feel
Feeling mugged
Tell me how the fuck you kill
Tell me how the fuck you steal
Pullin plugs
Tell me how the fuck you feel
Tell me how the fuck you feel
Like! You fell in love
Tell me how the fuck! You feel
Tell me how the fuck you feel

It's kinda bright on the dark side
Come, take a ride on the dark. Side
We got some things to find on the dark, side
Feeling deprived by The Pharcyde
You, a pharaoh phony nigga twitter 12. A Kony nigga
Throwing singles lonely nigga
And, it ain't! No! Where to go
Feelin cold hold borders, try to smile, cold, ebola
Feel, the breeze antiseptic
Go and pass it for your reverend
Like. It ain't, no, never mind
I'm a sinner
I. Just can't! Remember mine
I'm a member of the reminded
Lost, my mine
I hope it mind. Me
I, don't really see a real point in trying
Cause every day, niggas dying b
And in my head. I hope they find me
In my whole life. I haven't found peace
Missing peice to completed puzzles
Everday a different struggle
In everyway waving trouble
Praying, paying paving pavements

Kinda wAnt to scream

Phlegmatic. I just want to feel the green

Kinda tragic how you trade the fate of magic
And. All this different shit is happening
You got traffic in the fast lane
That's pain, a green ain't going change

Tell me who gon hold you down
When. You got traffic in the fast lane
