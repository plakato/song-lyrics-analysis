A Requiem for the Sons of Harmony Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

Fingertips on piano keys.
?
First again, the sound ?
Muted like a corpse.
?
To my creative fantasy.
I started to compose.
Quietly, until I reached into infinity.
Grace ?
A ? resonance.
? eternal harmony.
But I ? deeply.

? we are the sons of harmony.

The fortune of Mozart is ?
I can't go to sleep knowing he's better off than me.
I slept poisoned.
?
If I cannot be the greatest.
Then neither will you.

Rejoice with those who rejoice.
Weep with those who weep.

? music ?
?
Build your own life.
Guide your own death.
