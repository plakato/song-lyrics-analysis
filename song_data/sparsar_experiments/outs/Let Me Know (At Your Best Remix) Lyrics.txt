Let Me Know (At Your Best Remix) Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.

Tell me what it is.
Tell me what it is.
Make believe, no need to make believe.
Look beyond your own.
Look beyond your own.
Try and find another place for me.
Cause.
But at your best you are love.
You're a positive motivating force within my life.
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why.
Let me know, let me know.
