Bang Bang (feat. Tre Nyce & Young Kazh) Lyrics
by Swollen Members.


I crept up from above and took you out.
Look its a new sheriff in town.
Hope you know that you are going down.
Bang Bang Bang Bang I shut ya down.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.

Young Kazh.
My drop top back in the new westsell.
5509 girl I live real well.
Got the michellin s rims what up sprewell.
Swaggerlicious baby something like a pimp.
Ha, you know i get it, gucci new fitteds.
Deputy Diggum Dan, give em the business.
Ha, dont fake the funk you know we get it girl.
KC they know the camped all across the world.
Dont make me have to light shit up.
Got the real canaries boy I brighten shit up.
Got a sloppy juke in, better tighten that up.
My cash game up, my gas gauge full.
You fly crook push ki's and go to school.
Ive never met a nigga like me I do what I do.

Prevail.
We dont need no badges.
We dont need ya address.
We know where you live.
You know what this is.
The kids you should put em in the truck with wifey.
Before I let me nina start singing like a ????
Brother discover the pleasure the pain.
Whether you survive is the name of the game.
Put em on a stretcher blood pressure to the brain.
Its an ethical medical let-it-go mayne.
You a buster yo trust us its a west coast thang.
??? fuck with us got the best scope aim.
You choke up I break out the high grade smoke thangs.
And this beat was produced by Rob the Vikang.

I crept up from above and took you out.
Look its a new sheriff in town.
Hope you know that you are going down.
Bang Bang Bang Bang I shut ya down.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.

Mad Child.
Ive been on my grind since a kid on my big wheel.
Dont know how to put this but I'm kinda a big deal.
Little giant stop trying to assume.
My position I'll be firing my iron at ya dudes.
Bang Bang my crew gang bang the slang gang.
Doper than a kilo of columbian bam bam.
Rocking with a king ping doing my thing thing.
Listen to ya album and then I drain my main vein.
Hornet dog-gon-it my boss is all on it.
Imma duke of hazzard your crews a has-been.
Popping pills in yemen I got stupid habits.
A ruthless addict, gucci fabrics.
My group is magic and my troops are savage.
I'm a little dude with a very big ego.
So I roll with very big people.
Bad mutherfuckers not saying we evil.
Feels like everything we do is illegal.
Im fly like an eagle, eagle.
Listen to you rapping and I whip it like devo.
I ain't a clown dawg cash invested.
Friends ride bikes black vests and death heads.
Fucked up times can't trust you best friend.
I got friends doing ten from what I just suggested.
Im Yosemite Sam my two cannons go BAM!

I crept up from above and took you out.
Look its a new sheriff in town.
Hope you know that you are going down.
Bang Bang Bang Bang I shut ya down.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.

Tre Nyce.
I keep my hand on my ??? when I lay the sheets.
Bitch touch my baby ???? fuck wit my sleep.
We the comeback kids like Eli and Peyton.
Brothers from another like 50 and shaved head.
Fuck you saying and fuck you payment.
Pimping ain't easy but the money amazing.
Now we the best, its high time I remind you.
We can drop a body off were no one can find dude.
I'm in a crime mood so I'm a get cash.
Vision is point dawg criss cross steve nash.
Cat like reflex, playing some defense.
I can't guard niggas so I stay on defense.
I dont pretend to speak false pretense.
I spring right in action make you fall like ????
????? Chi-Town make you stay on the bull shit.
Im like oh shit who you think you fucking with.

I crept up from above and took you out.
Look its a new sheriff in town.
Hope you know that you are going down.
Bang Bang Bang Bang I shut ya down.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
