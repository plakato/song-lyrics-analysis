Yonkers Lyrics
by Ruse.


You'Re listenin to Wyatt Chipman the
high edition 
I have risen. Just did a line., I'm supplyin writtens 

The competition's locked in like convicts stocked in a prison 
My conviction's to convince em toss me
in with em 
Cause. Like a magician. I turn the opposition into victims, 
With compositions., So positive about it. 
I got the cops suspicious, 
I'm optimistic, but the problem is my noggin: isn't 
Cop a clinician cause. I'Ve been on a mission to 
Drop bombs on these pissants and right

Geometricians'll, get pissed and I'll just sit and laugh like ha, not my
problem. Is it 
 
Think, I'm finished, I ain't close just gettin started 
If. You don't think I'm somethin special you're, just straight retarded 
Let's, make a bargain I'll, be a peaceful, jerk 
If. You agree that I'm an artist and you're a piece of work, 
Think you're hard. You got it backwards like bees and birds, 
I'll, bang, ya up and then bang your mom, so you're reimbursed 
It wouldn't be the first time.. We'Ve done a lot to say 
The least but she's mad at me.. Last time I forgot to pay 
I'm actually not okay.. I just pocket the pain 
Cause. I don't got a thing to complain. About.. I was made this way. 
Naturally depressed but happily upset 
I'm a walkin paradox peerin off the frickin edge, 
Still suicidal. I am 
I'm Wyatt somebody put a giant hole in my head 
If. You could see my thoughts you'd see, I'm better off dead. 
Someone fill this void with lead, 
You're turnin heads., I'm snappin necks,
