The Fortune Teller Lyrics
by The World Alive.


They never said that it'd be easy.
To find another soul that wasn't empty.
Well I know now how hard it can be.
To give and to give not receive.

Never guessing I'd have all the answers.
I lost my mind chasing after her.
This is not what the fortune teller said.
This can't be how it's supposed to be.

Here I am now.
I'm all alone.
And I can't feel you now.
Am I on my own?
Am I on my own?

Why does it always have to end this way?

The closer and closer I get.
The more and more I choose to forget.

I'm buried deep in this dream we conceived.
Problematic, romantics, I'm lost you see.
It's a difference of opinion, we think we know.
The best way not to feel is to stay alone.

Separating what I feel from what I know.
The heart feels what it feels, and then it slows.
Taking prisoners but the head doesn't know.
Self-destruction of our sanity.
You'll get what you deserve.
But never what you need.
What do we need?

But I know I'm better this way.
I know I'm better this way.
I'm better this way.
