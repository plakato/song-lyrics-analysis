G.O.N (G Or Not) Lyrics
by Uniq Mic.


She said she heard that am a G.
So she wanted to see.
She said go on find the G spot.
That's how you show me if you're G or not.
G Or Not, G Or Not, Show me if you're G or Not.
G Or Not, G Or Not, Show me if you're G or Not.
G Or Not, G or Not, G, G, G Or Not, G or Not.
Prove to me you're G.

Show me that you gee like underground.
If you do it right, I might stick around.
I told her baby this' just crazy.
Come on you know that I ain't lazy.
Taught her the Alphabet.
She wanted to Eff with me.
So I gave her the D.
Now she can C.
That am never on E.
My Energy tank's never empty.
&amp; am part of the A Team, yet ama B-boy.
I made her enjoy.
She ain't never gonna play again with a toy.
Despised me, now she want living waters from my pipe.
Oh man I love this hype.
Felt like an astronaut, in that black ho.
Man I pull more strings than a puppeteer.
Got me boning only models, through out the year.
All my ex's know that.
They embarrassed to live n' all that.
And am just doing my thing.
But you know how it is when you're king.
You know how it is when you're him.
Got angels on my cheerleader team.

She said she heard that am a G.
So she wanted to see.
She said go on find the G spot.
That's how you show me if you're G or not.
G Or Not, G Or Not, Show me if you're G or Not.
G Or Not, G Or Not, Show me if you're G or Not.
G Or Not, G or Not, G, G, G Or Not, G or Not.
Prove to me you're G.

I didn't tell her am in college.
She getting banged cause of Malswitch.
All she thinks is that am a G.
Hustling hard for all this shit.
I treat today like a destination, see me live  for today.
Don't care what you say.
Dumb nigga, when this life took a shot at you.
You had a bullet proof vest on.
MW Nigga, but when I rap its like the west on.
So the ladies feel me, feel me.
And their niggas wanna kill me, kill me.
Got so many boos I ain't even know most of them.
Shout out RMC, this year we gonna own game.
I been killing these niggas, &amp; taking their chicks.
Been touching their boobs, on Instagram pics.
Got em burning inside like chilli.
Now what if I make a Mili?

She said she heard that am a G.
So she wanted to see.
She said go on find the G spot.
That's how you show me if you're G or not.
G Or Not, G Or Not, Show me if you're G or Not.
G Or Not, G Or Not, Show me if you're G or Not.
G Or Not, G or Not, G, G, G Or Not, G or Not.
Prove to me you're G.
