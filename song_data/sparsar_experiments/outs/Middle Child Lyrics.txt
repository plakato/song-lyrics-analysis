Middle Child Lyrics
by Quanche.


Sometimes I swear I forget.
OG Draqs shot himself in the head, Josh got shot the bullet paralyzed him he.
in a wheelchair, Bajun is dead.
Bubba is gone, Ruth got shot in his leg, Scoop got a slug in his lung it will.
be there for life.
G got life, he's tryna appeal it.
so whats so appealing about this life?
Skippy got sent back home, Fizzy came home to his little kid grown.
UOENO man I wish I didn't know, this scar on my face should've been on my.
throat.
Same week on the block gauze all on my cheek.
Same night my bros shot at whoever they seen.
Crack gotta move cause we gotta arm up.
Sause cut a mans face, Floyd cut his arm up.
Six months later thank God I'm alive.
Stabbed five man thank God they're alive.
Now days I don't carry nothing on mine, I'm not afraid to die and my hands.
work fine.
Oh, that's another thing I wish I'd known; I can have anything that I wish.
about.
So now I prophesize shit, young Ishmael.
Anything I wanna get back I just dish it out.

Middle Eight.
Driving big fat whips through the metropolitan.
Telling random brauds get in.
They only drink Cosmopolitan.
I'm okay with that.
I grew up in a way where you can't look back.
Don't leave me hanging.
X2.

Brad Pitt sample from Fight Club.
We're the middle children of history man.
No purpose or place.
We have no Great War, no Great Depression.
Our Great War is a spiritual war.
Our Great Depression is our lives.
