Money Off Cocaine Lyrics
by Yung mazi.


Money off cocaine, make money off cocaine.
Pussy rappers be talking about it but never seen it dope game.
Got it out the mud.
In the slum its dangerous.
Everybody around me on cocaine and angel dust.
I swear we even dogs who witnessed they be turning up.
If anybody play we blllbllbll and burn them up.
Caus they be be turning up, turning up, you could believe I'm turning up, now.
turn me up.
Everybody around me on cocaine and angel dust.
If anybody play we blllbllbll and burn them up.
Caus they be turning up.

I keep drinking like a cooler.
2, 2, 3 came with the cooler.
Now deebre, call Mezoter.
Check he added them calmers.
I see you, drama.
I see you, t-trauma.
Scared go to church.
My rolley is Obama.
Obama sweets, Obama seats.
I'm Obama to the streets.
I'm a samo with the heat.
My shooters, my killer.
Can't wait to turn up.
Can't wait to count up.
Can't wait to turn up.
Got it out the mud.
Pouring up the mud.
Gotta catch me, gotta kill me.
Fuck the judge.
Rather count a mill nigga, fuck the club.
Got the devil around me on angel dust.
Got Gates with me, Young Thug with me.
Your bitch with me, just a count up.

Thugga thugga baby.
Turn up, turn up.
Play, get bunked up.
Beeze up, run up.
My whole crew two gunners.
Mazi, big bruh.
Look at her.
Sherow, too good, damn, nerves.
Young thug you noise.
I got 80 chainz, I got two notes.
I'm on Miley Cyrus I have your notes.
And my best dressed nigga yea yea.
Got bricks like a motherfucking project.
Got bricks like a motherfucking yea yea.
All a nigga do is make profit.
And I'm smoking on the best nigga yea yea.
Chew 2000 make 3000.
DK on a mother fucking watcher.
DK got a fucking pocket rocket.
DK not gon hesitate to pop it.
Promethazine I slowed up.
I'm poured up.
Your bitch wanna cut us, then I moe her.

Trust Picture Focus.
Rocking presidential rollers.
Back out the trap here come the cash.
I'm about to dash, my foreign fast.
Do the do the dance, want a Kardashian.
Hustle this fortuitous.
in time with peace.
I'd rather die a solider.
Mix the yoda with the soda.
Coke and Toyota corollas.
My nigga head got bust open for a fuck nigga.
My heart broken.
Big Sean know how I'm rolling.
Take one of mine and I'm going in.
Laysich had a baby in 16 days 'till I get that bitch I ain't going in.
Jetlag on my going in.
That's RT8 I'm blowing in.
Back up camera I hate to use.
I'm old school I'm know well.
I broke two bricks to show broke niggas and hoes gon start I approaching in.
If you try around me don't let me shake that because if I come back it's over.
then.
