As The Beat Goes On Lyrics
by Sweet Tee.


As the beat goes on, I do damage.
Sit on your couch, grab a soda, a sandwich.
Entertaining is what I get paid for.
Sweet Tee is rockin' hardcore.
That's my life, word, it's essential.
Easy to get, whether if you know the fundamentals.
The music comes on, strong, slammin.
Hear the people say, Damn, she's jammin!
Speedin' up the beat, cause it's time for you to.
Hear new rhymes, cause the old ones won't do.
It's My Beat, that's finished, done through.
That's part one, this is part two.
Pausin' for the cause, and I'm comin out a winner.
I keep my rhymes with me through my breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Risin' and surprisin' those who thought I couldn't do it.
They didn't take me seriously, so now they blew it.
You thought I was a regular? Come on now, stop it.
I use the same beat twice, and still rock it.
I'm in the right, doin' no wrong.
Singin' my song as the beat goes on.

As the beat goes on, it's a cryin' shame.
When I flip on those who thought I was a regular dame.
Better step back, cause I'm gonna go off.
Huh, think again if you think I'm soft.
I'll squeeze you like a vice, and punch like Tyson.
Stick to my rhymes like white on rice, and.
Gettin to the point, and the point is this:.
Like Reggie on the play, when I hit, I don't miss.
Hittin' hard, raps well written.
Rock so hard, others think about quittin'.
Takin' my skills up to a much higher level.
Rap by myself, cause I'm a queen rap rebel.
Sincerely speakin, can't you see that.
I'm number one, you better believe that.
I'm on the verge, cause I got the urge to.
Get the feelin', so I wanna splurge, I'll.
Jump in my car, throw down the top.
Sip some wine and listen to some hip-hop.
Max and relax to the break of dawn.
As, as the beat goes, as the beat goes on.

Tee is here, and on the mic I'm a pro.
Don't tell me that I'm good, I know.
Demandin' respect, and I get it.
I write what I recite, and you can check the writer's credits.
Lethal with a pen, the result is awesome.
Combinin' with my crew, and it's a one-two-three-foursome.
Paid when I talk, my pockets are chunky.
Hurb's on the beats, and it's soundin' rather funky.
Weak-rhyme hater, ready now and never later.
Bring the great and the greatest, and I'll still be greater.
On the strength, not the bench I'm a heavyweight fighter.
Sting more deadly than a black widow spider.
Cooler than suede, and I don't mean leather.
Entrepreneur of the rap world forever.
Standin' on my feet or sittin in my seat.
You other rappers are obsolete.
So get ready, get set, and I'm on the go.
I'll seize the crowd and I squeeze out woe.
I'll never overstay my welcome, so.
I'ma drop the mic and let the beat flow.
