Swim and Sleep Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does.
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide till the end of time.
In that sweet cool darkness.
Asleep and constantly floating away.

I wish that I could break and mend like the world does.
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd chase all my dreams away.
And I'd let you crush me.
My dreams would be constantly melting away.

I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does.
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide til the end of time.
In that sweet cool darkness.
Asleep and constantly floating away.
