4th of July Lyrics
by X.

She's waiting for me.
When I get home from work.
Oh, but things just ain't the same.
She turns out the lights.
And cries in the dark.
And she won't answer when I call her name.

On the stairs I smoke a.
Cigarette alone.
Mexican kids are shooting.
Fireworks below.
And hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July.
Hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July.

She gives me a cheek.
When I want her lips.
Oh, but I don't have the strength to go.
On the lost side of town.
In a dark apartment.
We gave up trying so long ago.

On the stairs I smoke a.
Cigarette alone.
Mexican kids are shooting.
Fireworks below.
And hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July.
Hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July.

Whatever happened I, uh.
Apologize.
Dry your tears and, baby.
Walk outside.
It's the Fourth of July.

On the stairs I smoke a.
Cigarette alone.
Mexican kids are shooting.
Fireworks below.
And hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July.
Hey baby, baby.
Baby, take a walk outside.

Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July.
Hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July.
We forgot it's the Fourth of July.
Hey, babe!
Hey, babe!
Hey!
