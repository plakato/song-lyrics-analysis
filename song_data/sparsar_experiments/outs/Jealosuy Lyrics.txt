Jealosuy Lyrics
by The Purist.


The cheddar breed jealousy…
The cheddar breed jealousy

Especially. If that man, fucked up

Y'all, don't know where I come from nigga
You, don't know what I've been through ho
Said I wasted my time. Huh 
Look bitch, I done told you so
I done got on my own. Shit
I ain't need your help though
Bitch. I know I did it
You ain't got ta. Tell me. So
I done come a long way, I'm grindin' grindin'
Really. I ain't really have shit
Now your bitch. See me shinin' prime-timin'
And. She all up on my dick
‘Cause. She know I'm ballin' ballin'
J. J. Redick comin' off that pit
Shake take pics open up her mouth
And. My dick is about to go switch
Bitch it's…, Danny Motherfuckin' Brown
And. You know, I'm in beast: mode
So bitch go run them c-notes
She come through naked in a pea coat
‘Cause. She know she about to deep throat
Rubbin' on her clit playin', with her pee hole
Lookin', like she playin'
Guitar Hero
You niggas ain't in my league, ho
My flow's. So down my lingo
No nigga, you ain't my amigo
No senor. You no chico
I do not speak no Spanish
So. I don't know what that mean: yo
I met this Filipino and she was jalapeño

Get up off of your ass nigga
Worried about my fuck boy
I. Don'T love that bitch
Ho! Just my fuck toy
Got, the game in an uproar
Y'all are lames and so boring
Now your bitch got her tits out
Tryna get my laundry oh boy, 
I'm on some other shit
‘Cause y'all done got me. Fucked up
Y'all don't know who y'all fuckin' with
I'm a Linwood nigga ‘til, I'm dead in the grave
Detroit techno shootin' off weight
Nigga'd overtake ya back in the day
Don't. Make me go back to that nigga in the braids
Raised wrong caged, but a nigga escaped
So bitch-nigga. Don'T make me take that bait
Niggas in the hood got love for me
No Limits got Dungarees
So, I'm just tryna smoke. My weed
Tell me where the hoes at
All up in my cell phone
Nigga, you already know that
So I'mma call some hoes up
Tell ‘em bring some drink. Through
We gon' have a party
Called up your man Achbo
So last song, gettin' fucked up
‘Cause. We ain't worried, ‘bout it
Smokin' on that Master P
Bitch. We ‘bout it ‘bout it
