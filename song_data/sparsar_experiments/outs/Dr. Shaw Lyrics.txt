Dr. Shaw Lyrics
by Swift.

Five years old with an imagination the size of the red sea.
And every night he's out to get me.
I can't escape from his clutches I don't know one day I might just run away.
with nothing left to give.
Every time I lay my head on my pillow I get fucked up.
Well I know that I can't wake my dad up or he'll send me back to bed with a.
spanking.
And I can't tell anyone at school they'll just laugh and treat me cruel.
Actually this guy is chasing me inside my head.
I don't know if I'm alive or I'm dead.
Will this guy fucking leave me I can't seem to escape from these dreams and.
this madness.
I gotta go wake my grandpa up because he's the only one who'll understand.
Won't you stop chasing me because in these dreams I cry.
But no one hears me.
Frustrated at what I am I don't know I talk to the doctors.
But they can't help me.
I don't know which way is up or down all I know is he's chasing me.
Won't you stop chasing me because in these dreams I cry.
But no one hears me.
And I still get chills remembering the way that my head was tucked between the.
cold wall and my left arm and he's swinging that belt so hard.
I can hear it cutting the air and I look up to him and I say.

I hope you shoes shine from all the tears that you walk on.

And I ran all the way home.
