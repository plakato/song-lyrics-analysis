Addicted To The Cure Lyrics
by The Wombats.

Lately, I.
Have been speculating.
As to how and why.
These circles race whatever I do.
Your blonde hair.
Breaks this ten thousand yard stare.
Clearly, I.
Am still withdrawing it's true.

Somethings not right here.
The paint watches me as I dry here.
The pain watches me as I waltz through.
This black hole.
And I don't feel violent.
In fact I feel some way enlightened.
The best parts of us.
Always seem to have the most downfalls.

There's a cigarette in my mouth.
A nicotine patch is on the floor.
When did we get addicted to the cure?
Ahh ah ahh.
Ahh ahh.
I am addicted to the cure!

Sometimes, I.
Get aggravated.
With my concept of time.
And how the clocks tick backwards on cue.
Your blonde hair.
Breaks this wristwatch and it's cares.
Clearly I.
Am still withdrawing from you.

Somethings not right here.
The paint watches me as I dry here.
The pain watches me as I waltz through.
This black hole.
And I don't feel violent.
In fact I feel some way enlightened.
The best parts of us.
Always seem to have the most downfalls.

There's a cigarette in my mouth.
And nicotine patches on the floor.
When did we get addicted?
When did we get addicted?
But our heads tell us to stop.
As our chests scream out for more.

I'm proud to be addicted.
I'm proud to be addicted to the cure.

I am addicted to the cure.
I am addicted to the cure.

I am addicted to the cure.
