Enemy's Camp Lyrics
by Unity Klan.


I went to the enemy's camp.
And I, took back what he stole from me.
2x.

Stand at attention, time to fight the battle for the Lord.
Destination enemy's camp, takin it back by the sword.
My reward, to be free from misery to see victory.
Defeatin the enemy wit my armory.
Shalom How is your destiny.
Shalom We got the victory.
See the victory is mine and the military is prime.
You get checked wit don't mess wit the divine life I shine.
You find that the gates of hell won't prevail.
You fail, all your wicked schemes gettin nailed.
I'm sick of all your names, I'm sick of the games you play.
You hear this you fear this, spiritual warfare I pray.
One day, Jesus comes soon and you're doomed.
Revalations, manistation, tribulations of your tomb.
You read it in the word, your kingdom is gonna fall.
We're goin down to the enemy's camp and we're gonna take it all.

Souljahs at war, ready for battle to come in and knock on the devils door.
Any enemy in our way is bound to fall pray to my savior, judgment day.
Any way, it's spiritual warfare so always be ready, and keep the sword steady.
Fight back, take it back, pray it back, welcome to the enemy's camp.
Take the message to school, to job, to turn don't except no defeat, Satan's.
under our feet.
Take it to your freinds, your family, your neighbors, except no defeat,.
Satan's under our feet.
Take your home, your money, your visions, your dreams, except no defeat,.
Satan's under our feet.
Be bold, take care of plenty he stole, He's the light in the hell's fire, are.
you ready, let's go.

No matter clock on south wit a shout.
Straw horse get's broke like Jericho's no doubt.
Like the homie's rider cliq I'm surround, ready to clown.
Punks bout to sell out from a different side of town.
Couldn't hang out wit the King, steppin in the ring wit the redeemed.
Its all the same team, G O D Jesus Christ and the Spirit Unity the family.
That's comin strong, comin hard takin back what the devil done stole.
To the ghetto, that's where I go.
Nobody can stop me, pull me, drag me.
Wanna hit me wit a stick but I still won't quit.
Forever pack the holy scripts in the grip.
Now let me get the annointin, G O D flows like a river.
Can you deliever, make em all flee, can't you see.
The enemy tryin to creep, but you got the victory from the blood of calvary.
Now who are we.
