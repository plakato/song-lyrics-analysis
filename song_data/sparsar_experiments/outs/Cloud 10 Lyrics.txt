Cloud 10 Lyrics
by Sycosis.

Cloud 10 
 
Afraid to let em hear me so I let em read the words: / 
My nerves, wouldn't let me say it out loud then 
But now its my only outlet Cloud, 10
/ 
 
Sitting here, stressing over news that I just got 
Second glass of rum And orange juice playing X-Box/Trying to get distracted problems seem attracted 
To. Anything with my name. 
I. Don'T think that I'm sane/I think
that I've changed different than I used to be 
The. Only time I feel good is writing, beat eulogies. / 
That mean I kill a track and leave a beat deceased. 
You lace me with a beauty. I turn into a beast/I mean I feast on kick snares and high hats 
D.O.A. your 808's. Your bass line can get ate away. / 
And tell the competition they can get ate today. 
You, better fall back like a fadeaway/ 
What music was to me seems to fade away. 
Shorties grab a pen to get paid, they say, / 
I can't relate to it. I got passion for it, 
What's that that conscious Rap nigga, you asking for it / 
 
Can't, describe the feeling that I get when I grab a pen, 
I'm automatic it gets tragic and my head spin/ 
Went from rapping in the lunch room up at Thornton 

Lost, A battle then lost my mind. Now, I'm forcing 
This pen to keep writing til. I become the 5th horseman/ 
Horns out my cranium bones, Antimantium 
Claws out my knuckles fuck your
chuckles, I'm insane again/ 
Tri-Polar 3 sides to every story. 
Guts Guns Glory, I'm fighting like Brian Fury/, 
Teken 4 expect a war when they record me 
Detonate the Pro-tools. It explode right before me/ 
Real rap music fans, love adore me, 
But, whack niggas bore me. I'M coming. You can't ignore me/ 
I'm on my 10th cloud. Higher than I used to be 
Went from being shy to being fly still getting used to me/
