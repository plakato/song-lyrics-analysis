Comeback Lyrics
by 420Chainz.


Refrain 420 Chainz 
 
Had to take a trip 
Now, I'm on my Comeback: 
 
Six figures on my wrist 
Seven on my phone 
So, many bitches on me. 
I can never be alone. 
, 
420, 420 
Hoes. On my dick 
Beating. All these bitches 
You can call me Michael Vick, 
 
Stunting on your bitch 
Even, though I'm a youngin' 
I beat ya' ass up nigga 
Cuz'. You know I stay muggin', 
 
Fuck Nick Bean, I'm over that 
Fuck Nick Bean. I brought it back 
Too much money, 
Make a stack 
420 on my neck bitch 
Break ya' back 
 
Never beat the house 
Cuz', I'm always dealing 
And. I got my 68' 
Only when I'm wheeling 
Chrome to ya' dome 
Only when I'm killing 
 
Born in the Trap. 
Killed in the Trap 

Man, I swear it's coming back: 
 
Breakdown, 1 
, 
Refrain, 420 Chainz 
 
Had to take a trip 
Now, I'm on my Comeback. 
 
I mean fuck. That 
I mean step back. 
I mean smack that 
 
No Chris Brown, 
No Akon 
I'm too big 
Like King Kong, 
Knock knock 
No, ding dong, 
I steal your girl to 
This song 
 
Dinosaur 69. Lay it on the track. 
All. These bitches hating on me 
Need to fall back 
I roll with the realest 
But. I ain't a politician. 
I keep the beat correct 
But. I ain't a technician: 
 
Popping off these shots, 
The bass, still kicking 
Fresh car that I'm rolling in 
New Slave whipping 
 
Everywhere. I go: 
I am sizzurp sipping 
And, my line's, so dope 
You will never see me flipping 
 
Spitting. This fire 
I could burn a fucker down 
Smoking. All this Kush 
I am never turning down. 
 
I stay high, 
That's jet time, 
Got, two girls 
Thats two dimes 
I'm Two-Ten 
Two-Times 
So many problems. 
I got two 9's 
 
I shoot it up like Newtown 
And. I blow it up like Boston, 
Killing, nigga's left and right 
Because. They just talkin' 
 
Breakdown, 2. 
 
Refrain 420 Chainz 
 
Had to take a trip 
Now, I'm on my Comeback: 
 
Karma's, a bitch 
But, a bitch I like to fuck 
She's, always on my dick 
But. She never down to suck 
 
Ballin' on the hardwood. 
Never scuff my shit 
Never fuck with me, 
Cuz' I'll, probably fuck, your bitch 
 
Throw up my gang signs. 
Yeah, you know it's real 
I come from the trap 
Bitch. You know. I kill 
 
I pipe your bitch 
No Stanley, Steemer 
Got, her Cuming' 
Stanley Screamer 
Wet. Back 
I call her beaner 
Fucked. Your girl 
She got the weiner 
 
Imma', try and spit on it. 
If it just came out 
Then, I probably done own it 
My flow, so smooth 
That, these nigga's tryna' clone it 
My plane. So new 
That no-one has ever flown it. 
 
You can call me Lazzarus 
By the way, I'm popping bands 
Taking shit about me, 
No-need to throw hands 
Kill your career 
In front of all my fans, 
Getting big. Despite my haters' motherfucking plans,
