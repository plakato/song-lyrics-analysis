Amazing Grace Lyrics
by Xavier Naidoo.

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound.
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now I'm found.
Was blind, but now, I see.

T'was Grace that taught.
My heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear.
The hour I first believed.

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound.
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now I'm found.
Was blind, but now, I see.
