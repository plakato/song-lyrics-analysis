The Awakening Lyrics
by 4hero.

Sister girl.
Wanna tell you about this thing.
That's been weighing heavy on my heart.
Haunts both my dreams and my first breath.
Hmmm where to start, well...

Revolution it seems has become an antique.
When in my youth.
Revolution was what we rose.
With the sun to seek we were fierce.
Now, our glory days are nothing.
But a page in an edge worn book.

An afro.
A raised fist.
A black beret.
Black pride.
Set aside.
Reduced to mere history.

It saddens me.
Mm.
It saddens me.

But will these words fall on deaf ears.
Cos my tears won't fill up the riverbed of resistance and change.
It's gone dry and gone and unknown are the names.
Which gave that river its tranquility, its beautiful force and godspeed.
Rise up out of the complacency induced sleep we need.
An Awakening.

Bring, bring, bring the noise.
Daughter now is the time for you and your generation.
To put this universal chaos in order.
Me and mine, we held high the picket signs.
Met behind closed doors spoke out against war.
Spoke up for art and equality.
Told people we are a community, a family.
The years travel quick like speed of light.
And the torch light is burning low.
And my tears you know they won't fill.
The riverbed of resistance and change.
They are just an offering for those who have been named.
With love and those who had died.
That they rest knowing that their lives.
Were worth the fight that this planet and life.
Are gifts to all not just a chosen few.

But now our future are up to you.
So what are you and your brothers and sisters gonna do?

But Mama.
The resistance seemed so futile.
When all the while.
Government and media massacre my dreams.
We, my brothers and sisters and me.
Are at the mercy of, Dotcoms.
Bombs that kill at least 30 daily.
The constant downward spiral of music and humanity.
A general lack of concern, knowledge and history.

Our potential leaders and spokespeople are chasing materialistic ideals.
Seems our fates have been sealed with a Bling Bling kiss.
So.
Shall i just have the violins play for me.
As i recite this soliloquy of missed opportunity.
A eulogy at the funeral for the modern day visionary.
Or shall i rise as you call me.
Will i fall or stand firmly?

Mama.
Advise me.
Guide me.
I want to be made ready.

Baby girl.
You sound ready to me.
The spirit, fire, of Assada, Angela, Ghandi, King and Garvey.
In your veins bleed for your legacy.
Keep the eyes on the prize of peace.
And don't pardon me while i preach.
Because.

Even hurricane and tsunami have spoken earths peace.
As they rose, with wind and waves to say.
'cease this increase of heartlessness and regress'.

So please, please.
Beg no apology.
As you speak for truth.
Move.
Into the Awakening.
Bring, bring.
Bring the noise daughter.
Its past time for you and your generation.
To put this universal chaos in order.
The now and future are up to you.
So what are you and your brothers and sisters gonna do?

Mama.
I still question the meanings of freedom and peace.
But i will not retreat.
I will instead meet this challenge.
Head on and heart strong.
Sing. my protest songs.
Take your hand and example.
And go well into the storm and struggle.
With torchlight ample and bright.
To fight.

Awaken my spirit.
Shaken but never stirred.
Make my generations voice heard.
Rewrite this thing.
Bring the noise and the Awakening.
Sing.
