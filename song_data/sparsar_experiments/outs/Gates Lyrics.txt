Gates Lyrics
by Tyler Glenn.


Too many lights on me.
There's way too, too many lights on me.
And give me everything you got.
I think I'm going to go get lost.
Cause there's way too, too many lights.

Imma kiss my love like I want to.
Dancing in the dark like I used to.
Does anybody wanna smoke in the back room?
I used to be somebody cool that your friends knew.

Imma kiss my love like I want to.
Gotta love him while I can like the great's do.
We can make it through the night.
It'll be cool, it'll be cool.

I'll see you at the gates.
I'll see you at the gates.
Baby, we're just gonna live forever.
Baby, heaven's gonna stay.

If it's true and I lost my way.
If it's true and I lost my way then.
I'll see you at the gates.
Imma see you at the gates.

I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.

There's too many lights on me, yeah.
I never wanted so many eyes on me.
We can meet up in a dream.
I say we stop pretending, please.
Cause there's way too, too many lights.

Imma live my life like I want to.
Hanging in the park like I used to.
Does anybody have a song we can sway to?
We used to be somebody cool that our friends knew.

Imma tell the truth like I can't choose.
Gotta tell them while I can like the great's do.
We can make it through the night if we keep our cool.
If we keep our cool.

I'll see you at the gates.
I'll see you at the gates.
Baby, we're just gonna live forever.
Baby, heaven's gonna stay.

If it's true and I lost my way.
If it's true and I lost my way, then.
I'll see you at the gates.
Imma see you at the gates.

I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.

Take me to the coast, my makeup's on and I think I feel pretty.
Keep me far away from Salt Lake City.
It's you I love the most, so let's have a toast.
A tango with the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

I'll see you at the gates.
I'll see you at the gates.
Baby, we're just gonna live forever.
Baby, heaven's gonna stay.

If it's true and I lost my way.
If it's true and I lost my way.
I'll see you at the gates.
I'll see you at the gates.

I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.

I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
I will see you at the gates.
