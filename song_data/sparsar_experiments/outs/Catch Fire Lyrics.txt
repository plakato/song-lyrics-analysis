Catch Fire Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


Oh say: can you see? 
This is not who I'm supposed to be 
Without you, I'm nobody killing time 
I tried to deceive tried to win you desperately 
Now, I'm lost in this swirling sea of your sorry eyes. 
 
All, my life. I'Ve been waiting for moments to come. 
When I catch fire and wash over. You like the sun. 
I will fight to fix up and get things right. 
I can't change the world, but maybe I'll change your mind. 
 
Oh say: do you know, I'm a fool in a one. Man show 
I'm a broken stereo out of time 
So. How does it feel All alone? Is it so surreal 
Cause, the ghost of survivor's guilt, can be so unkind. 
 
All, my life. I'Ve been waiting for moments to come. 
When I catch fire and wash over. You like the sun. 
I will fight to fix up and get things right. 
I can't change the world, but maybe I'll change your mind. 
 
The words you speak surrounding me. 
This is broken. Love in the first degree, 
The air you breathe is haunting me 
Maybe I'll change your mind. 
 
All, my life. I'Ve been waiting for moments to come. 
_When I catch fire and wash over. You like the sun 
I will fight to fix up and get things right. 
I can't change the world_ 
I know that I can't change the world 
_But. Maybe I'll change your mind_
