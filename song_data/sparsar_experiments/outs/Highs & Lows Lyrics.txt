Highs & Lows Lyrics
by Zip K..


I got this shit on ... 
Got. This shit on 
 
We got this shit on high high high 
We used to sit on low low lows. 
I got dem pockets right right, right, 
Now, wherever I go, go go 
I must be wit da squad aye 
Cool wit, dem shottas 
We in everybody city goin' hammer 
I got the shit on high high high 
We used to sit on low low lows, 
 
I'm. In my hometown, feeling, like a stranger 
I, been trucking through the woods like a ranger 
Where that pussy, I can take out all my anger. 
Cuz. My shit on high high high 
With dem niggas, that's committing on the dangers 
Lifestyle. Looking like we entertainers 
I can see a hatin nigga thru, my framers 
Cuz, my shit on high high high 
Am, I bunkin Yea yea yea 
Am. I flexin. No, no, no 
Am, I winning Yea yea yea 
Am. I stressin! No, no, no 
Get the gas loud loud loud, 
Double, cuppas, full full full 
Life can weigh you down down down 
Tug o war. We pull pull pull 
Like my bitches ba-ay-ad 
And, my whippers mea-ea-ean 
Need, my pockets, gla-ay-azed 
Talkin, Krispy Kree-ee-eam 
I been workin hard, hard hard. 
They ain't gim me: none! None, none! 
Now! I'M going hard hard, hard. 
Imma get me some yeah 
 
Fuck 12 knockin lookin through my peep hole, 
Tryna jam me and all my people 
Knowing. How we juugin is illegal, got my shit on high high high 
Need, a bank account bigger than my ego 
First number followed by a buncha, zeros 
Matter fact. I'D rather keep it on the d-low 
Cuz. My shit on high high high 
I get money fast fast. 
I be talkin good, good 
Like, a player should 
I be tappin. Ass, ass, 
If, lil, momma, bad bad 
I'mma, give her wood 
Took, no seasons off off 
Learned that from my pa, pa 
Get it out the dirt 
Till I drop the top off 
And. I pour my hot sauce on my chicken herb. 
I might hit the curb switch and swerve 
Hitcha bird pinch, a nerve, 
When, niggas, flippin kitchen work, 
30 minutes till your dish is served 
But. They ain't got ta scheme, no more. No, no! No! No 
We used to have so many low low low low low, but now 
 
Looking. For Me, Snippet
