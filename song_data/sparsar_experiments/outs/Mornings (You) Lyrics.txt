Mornings (You) Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.


Early in the morning with my stinky breath.
But never would you ever start thinking less.
Just a couple things that i got to confess.
That I never really been in this predicament.
Back back yes I'm backing up.
But what that only does is make you pull up.
Pull up what till I'm Seeing what.
You must be Tripping giving secrets up.
Putting on a show don't keep it up.
I'm Not the only one watching they watching us.
It's been five minutes and I'm thinking ugh.
I don't even know you temptation ugh.
Unclear statements going to make me ugh.
Brain thinking ugh.
You'r ranking ugh.
Just give me some is my mindset.
Been a little while since I Ever felt regret.
And if it happens now that'll be the worst regret.
We're in the race now get ready set.
You jumped the gun I ain't even ready yet.
You already knew what i want I ain't even said it yet.
Going down a track and it curves very fast.
But i can't be last.
Pass the current on the past.
Life's a flash.
Realizing that you live it up to fast.
Babygirl slow it down it's too early for that.

Mornings when I think about you.
I hit you like what you sayin'.
In the mornings when I wanna, you.
I Hit you like what you sayin'.
I could  you all the time.

Mornings when I think about you.
I hit you like what you sayin'.
In the mornings when I wanna, you.
I Hit you like what you sayin'.
I could  you all the time.

Wake up in the morning wonder what is going on.
Cuz a minute ago had you in under arm.
Nothing making noise everything is really calm.
Was it all a dream am I back to reality.
But i don't wanna be and that's really sad to me.
Cuz in reality, you is really mad at me.
Isn't Me who should scream it's a tragedy.
Tell me what's the point the lack of talking.
Tell me what's the point the act of bossing.
Me in the corner till I blow like boston.
Sorry, they still mourning that.
But what about me I should mourn your acts.
You wasn't in to me and that's a fact.
I was set up to fail that's why I hate tests.
Now I need to cope need to get it off my crest.
Maybe I'll find a girl with some really big breast.
On second thought i ain't with all that.
I'm looking to the Stars now.
You Trying to shoot Stars Down.
Is that really called for.
Tell me what you call for.
Thinking in my head this got to mean something.
But if I say something she ain't saying nothing.
We ain't together but she say she cuffing.
If I say you mine the you say I'm bluffing.

Mornings when I think about you.
I hit you like what you sayin'.
In the mornings when I wanna, you.
I Hit you like what you sayin'.
I could  you all the time.

Mornings when I think about you.
I hit you like what you sayin'.
In the mornings when I wanna, you.
I Hit you like what you sayin'.
I could  you all the time.

Dreadhead Schoolboy &amp; Young D.
Sinful in is nature but it's unavoidable.
Being only human is unavoidable.
Life is so priceless but it's unaffordable.
He put me in this life to live it right and in the world for you.

Yes I'm in the world for you.
Would have gave the world for you.
Showed that i'd pass on really bomb girls for you.
Even let my mind spin in a swirl for you.
Probably would have went to the ocean got pearls for you.

Probably would have got american apparel for you.
Yea that might sound kinda hysterical to you.

It's hysterical? not a miracle.
Swear you the reason I'm lyrical.

Here we go again ohh here we go.

Another argument no here we go.

Here we go again with this scenario.

You claiming you the reason im successful.

I just met you girl, why you stressing girl.
You don't even know me, quit your guessing girl.

Been through this before learn your lesson girl.
Took me for granted but you a blessin girl.

We all in the game.
But that don't mean we all.
Play.
Some of us cheat and.
Some of us spectate.
Looking at the past.
Guess we can't invent our fate.
Nothings as it seems.
Cuz in the end.
It penetrates.

Mornings when I think about you.
I hit you like what you sayin'.
In the mornings when I wanna, you.
I Hit you like what you sayin'.
I could  you all the time.

Mornings when I think about you.
I hit you like what you sayin'.
In the mornings when I wanna, you.
I Hit you like what you sayin'.
I could  you all the time.

Ah yeah it's over now.
Ah yeah I need closure now.
Ah yeah it's over now.
