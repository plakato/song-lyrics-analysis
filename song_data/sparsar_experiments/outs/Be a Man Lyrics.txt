Be a Man Lyrics
by Wordsworth.


Hit the play button, got a chance to say something.
The pen to the page touching like a paint brushing.
Carriages, baby daddies, but we ain't husbands.
Marriage is in the future, but we ain't rushing.
It's a design we began that's defining a man.
Money, women, fights, spending time in the can.
A father only shows a boy how to become a man.
Not true, single parents showed a mother can.
Stepdad tried to show your mom his raising abilities.
Was rent free, now she want paying utilities.
Your responsibilities was grades, babysitting, no work.
Just keeping from those convict facilities.
It's cool that, once you were the man of the house.
But when your mom finds a man then you should plan to be out.
And I don't want to be a failure neither.
Coming to jail to see us, reading mail, using mail to free us.
Finally Ma, I did it, my music's coming.
Tell you everything so you know that I'm doing something.
See the shame in my face when I ask you for money.
So embarrassed almost had Khadijah asking you for me.
Wanna be a man, but I know my pride will kill me.
I'm your son, so if I didn't aks you'd find it silly.
In my memory my worst day is.
Asking you for money so I can go and buy your birthday gift.

Probably didn't think I'd make it but I survived.
Standing looking at the sky as time would fly.
And you knew I'd be a man when I decide.
Surprise Surprise, Surprise Surprise.
Probably didn't think I'd make it but I survived.
Standing looking at the sky as time would fly.
Everything's good cause you stood by my side.
Surprise Surprise, Surprise Surprise.

Wave your hands side to side.

Superficial, showing off for the group that's with you.
Artificial, yes man in your crew makes you official.
And ladies jump in your car, cruising the city.
Picking guys how they look so that their children are pretty.
Midguided, but inspired, from our hoods came songs.
Buying things to the make up for a childhood that's gone.
Better days now steps away, close to the edge.
Went through enough, but it's tough, rougher roads are ahead.
Pledge to good health, long life, we toast and break bread.
Cause we made it past the age we were supposed to be dead.
Fabric of life, what I compose is a thread.
Poems I've said go beyond violets blue and roses are red.
When gone they'll have a monumental stone of a throne.
Sculpted of me, chin in my hand, holding my head.
The lessons written in these rhymes, like a blessing in disguise.
The fittest survive and real recognice likewise.
