Untitled Freestyle Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

I'm dropping jewels freely.
Like Jared's hands were greasy.
Jesus Christ that was wack.
Can someone please start me back?

Alright let's try this shit again.
Yo.

I'm tearing tracks up like a stadium is shutting down.
I'm building then destroying like it's Royce's second album.
Crushing the competition mixing brake fluid and Valiums.
Abusing Nuprins and losing any sense of value.
I breathe lyrics, eat lines and dream of a beat's art.
Every morning I bite a Kit-Kat so I make sure I even shit bars.
Screw a crew, I'm a team, you're looking like you're Billie Jean.
I spit illy things so lick it mean till my dick is clean.
Quickly serving fiends.
Handing needles at my concerts, popping OxyContin, and watch your momma's.
momma twerk in jeans.
I haven't worked a day and don't plan on getting sleep for weeks.
My sponsor's given up; I'm dropping coke and freezing weed to eat.
These lyrics fill my head; I'm Dwight Schrute with my need for beats.
I'll take your ugly mug and fuck it up with some metal cleats.
Lacing mad spliffs and hitting switches with some crazy bitches.
Spit at Christians and jerking off to your mommy's baby pictures.
