Out of Sight (Yo) Lyrics
by Rufus Blaq.

Have you ever been ambushed 
 
Every time I write a rhyme 
You know it's tight, 
People, say B-L-A-Q, you out of sight, 
Yo chiki, chiki high chiko, 
Comin' through'bout to do the impossible, 
 
Never test B-L-A-Q, the six footer 
You tried to call my bluff. How could ya 
Frontin', when you ain't got straps 
Why? Would ya 
Cuttin' hard core
