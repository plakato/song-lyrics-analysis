God Only Knows Lyrics
by Rushlow.

There's a lot of people laughing and smiling.
There's a lot of people hurting and crying.
It doesn't matter which one you are.
You won't get far before you feel them both.
It doesn't matter if tears of pain or tears of joy.
Are what you feel the most.
I only know the sun shines through.
It always does, it always has to.
There's a lot of questions that we'd love to ask.
If we get the chance to.

God only knows who is gonna live.
Who is gonna take and who is gonna give.
Which one is gonna fly like an eagle in the sky.
Which one is gonna fall, becoming heroes to us all.
Who grows old, who dies young.
God only knows.

Life is what we make it, so take it and live it well.
Don't worry about tomorrow, let tomorrow worry about itself.
And tell the ones that you love so.
To take it slow cause time goes by so fast.
Cherish every second here.
Live every day like it might be your last, cause.

God only knows who is gonna live.
Who is gonna take and who is gonna give.
Which one is gonna fly like an eagle in the sky.
Which one is gonna fall, becoming heroes to us all.
Who grows old, who dies young.
God only knows.
God only knows who is gonna live.
Who is gonna take and who is gonna give.
Which one is gonna fly like an eagle in the sky.
Which one is gonna fall, becoming heroes to us all.
Who grows old, who dies young.
Who's to say what's to come.
God only knows, God only knows.
