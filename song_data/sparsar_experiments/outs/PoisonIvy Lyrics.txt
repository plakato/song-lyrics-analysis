PoisonIvy Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Fading away, I feel it in my veins.
Fading away, I know I'm not okay.
Fading away, I feel it in my veins.
Fading away, I know I'm not okay.

On the porch and I'm smokin' blunts.
Breathe the dope and I open up.
My veins erupt and then I shed my skin.
Skeleton boys on the block again.
I drink my flask and I flick my ash.
And when the wind gets cold, flashback to the past.
Tires wrapped in them chains.
Snow cover my face.

Interlude: Bones.
I just want to know, I just want to know.
Cause nights get cold when you're all alone.
I just want to know, I just want to know.
Cause nights get cold when you're all alone.

I make the ground fall through with my power.
Fool, shut the fuck up, fuck what you think, bruh.
You don't have any sense, that's what my sense say.
R.I.P. sensei, watch o'er me.
I'm the homie to none of the weak.
I sleep great, blade by me, don't try me.
I know how I be in the tree, finna smoke this poison ivy.
Bitch.
