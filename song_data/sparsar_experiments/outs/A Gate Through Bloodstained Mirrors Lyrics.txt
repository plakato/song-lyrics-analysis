A Gate Through Bloodstained Mirrors Lyrics
by Xasthur.

Paint in blood.
A sigil of death.
On fading reflections.
Beneath this night.
Master of their infernal fears.
I take these burning gates...to reign.
Pass this torch of evil.
Through the candlelit.
Bloodstained mirrors....
To succumb to the netherworld of Satan.
Stare through the eyes of my mirror master.
And the mirror stares back into me.
