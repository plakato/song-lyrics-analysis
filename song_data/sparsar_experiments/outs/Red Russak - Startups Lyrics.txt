Red Russak - Startups Lyrics
by Yumas.

Red Russak.

All around the globe, people pave the way.
Changing how we think we about the world today.
In the middle of the desert or deep in the tropic.
It's amazing to think that 'Startup' is a topic.

What impresses me the most is the speed of technology.
Changing every second, fueled by curiosity.
Whether you're starting alone or working with a team.
Fight as hard as you can to realize your dream.

Each and everyone of us has a role to play.
There's no time to waste, you must start right away.
Learn to walk, why even crawl?
Act on your ideas, no matter how big or small.
