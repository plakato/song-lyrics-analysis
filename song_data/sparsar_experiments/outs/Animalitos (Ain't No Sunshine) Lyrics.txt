Animalitos (Ain't No Sunshine) Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

It's always cold when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
She's always gone too long.
Any time she goes away.

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
In this house just ain't my home.
Any time she goes away.

I know.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I will leave your things alone.
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
Only darkness every day.

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
In this house just ain't my home.
Any time she goes away.
Any time she goes away.

I wonder this time where she's gone.
I wonder if she's gone to stay.

I leave your things alone.
But there ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
I leave your things alone.
But there ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

Any time she goes away.
Any time she goes away.
Any time she goes away.
