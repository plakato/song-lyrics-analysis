After Light (feat. AlunaGeorge) Lyrics
by Rustie.


Pure in the mess.
Slow we undress.
Answers we guess.
Feeling our best.

Sow it in the undertoe.
Holding on to what we know.
Losing every anchor thrown.
Moving with the hunger growing.

We are the nightburn.
Keeps you running, makes you wanna be in the fight.
Better hold on tight.
We are the blaze that keeps you raising.
Higher, higher, higher.

We are the nightburn.
Keeps you running, makes you wanna be in the fight.
Better hold on tight.
We are the blaze that keeps you raising.
Higher in the after light.

Higher in the after light.
Higher in the after light.

Pure in the mess.
Slow we undress.
Answers we guess.
Feeling our best.

Sow it in the undertoe.
Holding on to what we know.
Losing every anchor thrown.
Moving with the hunger growing.

We are the nightburn.
Keeps you running, makes you wanna be in the fight.
Better hold on tight.
We are the blaze that keeps you raising.
Higher, higher, higher.

We are the nightburn.
Keeps you running, makes you wanna be in the fight.
Better hold on tight.
We are the blaze that keeps you raising.
Higher in the after light.

We are the nightburn.
Keeps you running, makes you wanna be in the fight.
Better hold on tight.
We are the blaze that keeps you raising.
Higher, higher, higher.

We are the nightburn.
Keeps you running, makes you wanna be in the fight.
Better hold on tight.
We are the blaze that keeps you raising.
Higher in the after light.
