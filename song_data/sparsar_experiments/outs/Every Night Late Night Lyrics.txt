Every Night Late Night Lyrics
by Yungen.


Yeah, I'm back 
Haha. I ain't even go nowhere. 
 
Uh made money lost money. 
Who gives a fuck, though I'm up now 
Wireless didn't book me 
They must've thought I couldn't shut down. 
Krept and Kone brought me out, though 
Ain't On Nuttin' and it's shutdown. 
Stormz brought me out and I shut down. 
I must be the lightskinned Skeppy 
Every time I touch down. I shut down, 
Do it for the love, not the paper. 
Still got my middle finger up at a hater. 
Money, never changed me. How did I forget man 
When? I put Cash on Ain't On Nuttin' from Jamaica Later 
You are not a G's caliber 
After school. I used to eat Shalamar 
Yeah, I'm legit now and I get mo' stacks 
But. I still roll with that ni na na na 
Dem boy paigon. I don't trust them. 
Remember fuck them 
I still ride for my bruddas cause. I love them. 
And I'll risk. It fucking all if you touch them 
But summertime's here now: let's get it popping 
Come through in the Batmobile. You all think I'm Robin 
Black
