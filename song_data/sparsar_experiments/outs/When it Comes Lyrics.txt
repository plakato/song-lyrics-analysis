When it Comes Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

I study up my hollow.
Piece of wood to follow.
A day that doesn't come.
To the lucky.

And I realize there's tomorrow.
But I would rather wallow.
In the rain then moods that seem.
So pot-lucky.

Well I'm cruising El Paseo.
In my off-white coup back '65.
Or I'm cruisin down my own street.
And my hooptie says to me.
You better hang on to your bench seat.
I'm gonna take you for a ride.

And I'll let you know.
When it comes, when it comes.
I'll let you know.

But don't stay up for me.
Don't wait up for me.
If I'm not home.

So I wait for fate to find me.
A ball of string unwind me.
Uncomfortable as a centerfold.

And I realize your behind me.
To help and humankind me.
To see my songs can be retold.

Well I'll be gone tomorrow.
Yes I'm on the road tomorrow.
So next time that I see you in school.
It won't be for too long.

And I'll let you know.
When it comes, when it comes.
I'll let you know.

But don't stay up for me.
Don't wait up for me.
If I'm not home.

And I want a leather jacket.
But only if I have the time.
Well, I'll comb my hair like Elvis.
And grab an old Gretch 59.

And you'd hardly recognize me if you.
Saw me from behind.

And I'll let you know.
When it comes, when it comes.
I'll let you know.

And I'll let you know.
When it comes.
Just when it comes.
I'll let you know.

But don't stay up for me.
Don't wait up for me.
If I'm not home.

And I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.
Well I'll let you know.
