Northern California Lyrics
by Woodie.

Woodie 
As, I drop the top 
In my'69 Buick Sky Lark, late mornin' 
I could feel the heat brewin' 
It's gon na be a hot one. 
A 40 ounce right now. I ain't got one 
It's time to bounce 
To the liquor store and swing. This 
I'm havin' fits 
I need a cold Old English 
Once. I get it 
Hit. My next tail bling list 
Homies outside 
We, turn the park into a freak fest freak fest 
So call your team of hoes 
Let'em know that's it's crackin', 
Food alcohol and weed free 
With, bikini action. 
If. You show up with more 
Than daisey dukes and a skinny top 
Flip a bitch and shake the spot 
Obviously. You ain't got 
What. We wan na see 
On this beautiful day, 
We tryin', to take a break 
From that gangsta life in the bay 
We got that charcoal on standby 
And meat by the pounds, 
I'm, talkin' gallons of liquor, 
And all the freaks from the town, 
It's goin' down different sets. 
Congregatin' to kick it 
Just the Northeners and allies 
Ain't. Nobody set trippin', 
Got pitbulls chained to the trees 
And. If you fear 
I'm guaranteed that they're lockin' our knees, 
So, don't go near'em 
Grab a seat on the bench, relax 
Fire up the stench 
Of that Northern Cali rope 
As the super soaker drench 
These notches - might as well be topless 
With nipples on swole 
Stiffer than those On triple gold's 
 
Oooooh, Northern California, 
We got somethin' for ya 
Northern California 
We got somethin' for ya, 
 
B-Dawg 
Wake up in the mornin' 
And. I stretch 
Wipe the sleep from my eyes: 
Stagging to the frigerator 
Grab a 40, a St. Ides 
Still twisted from the night before 
Tryin' to regroup, 
The telephone rings, 
Niggas talkin''bout they gon' swoop 
So. I hops in the shower 
Fit ironed and creased 
I gots, to make a good impression 
On these top notch freaks 
See, it's an everyday thang, 
To ride and side in the Bay 
And best believe come the weekend. 
Boy we know to parlay 
At. Have it always all day 
Boy it don't stop 
Mackin' hoes in your 
Six Tray, Chevrolet drop 
Spittin' game to the finest 
Northern Cali has to offer me 
Ocean front party on the beach 
Hoes jockin' me 
Lil' Los and Wood 
Got, some freaks of they own 
The way. It'S lookin' 
Boy this party's goin' all night long 
So get your purve on 
Go ahead and blaze up the Q 
And, like they say, 
Don't, be afraid of the way that you feel 
Now, 
 
Lil' Los 
It's your boy from around the way 
Where I was born And raised 
To live and die in the Bay 
This Cali game. You can't stop it. 
Pocket full of profits. 
Haters try to knock it as were 
Poppin' out some notches 
50 always watch us. 
Cuz were constantly in somethin' 
Folks shootin', dice 
Tryin' to constantly win somethin'. 
Brains blown as we roll through our pro 
Chronic clouds. In my dome 
On, my cellular phone 
Tellin', the homies Come on 
As we creep to the spot, 
In the back of a brawl, 
Gettin' stoned in the parkin' lot. 
Course I like to watch it. 
And, walk up to the function. 
Doja go me feelin', good 
Tellin', my boys, that it's jumpin' 
Hop out the ride, 
And, let them clouds bellow out 
When that liquor's in my veins 
All, you broads, have no doubt 
I'm a walkin' and talkin' 
Playa plottin' up on ya. 
Soakin' yo brain with game 
Northern, California, 
 
Shannon Sanders 
Northern Cali-forn-I-A, 
Northern, Cali-forn-I-A, 
Northern, Cali-forn-I-A, 
, 
Woodie, 
It's blazin' saddles today. 
That sun could melt ya, 
So lets cool off 
Launch the boat and hit the delta 
We lovin' the breeze off the water 
As. We cruise 
Keep an eye out for sheriffs 
In case. We got ta hide the booze 
As. We slide through the back slooze 
In between the Yoc and Stockton. 
We headed to the spot. 
Where hoochie tops are droppin' 
Lost styles, 
Where hoes, act, wild and silly 
Body shots and blow jobs, 
Drinkin' styles, so filthy, 
Everybody's, boat, hoppin', 
There, ain't, no stoppin' 
This party. Once it's jumpin' 
Wish, it happened more often 
Fewer and fewer clothes on 
As. The day goes on. 
Next thing you know: 
Hoes are naked and the show's on 
Now who's got the bomb breasts. 
Who'S legs are longest, 
Who's got the booty. 
You can use for an arm rest 
As long as there's no hatin' 
With, no police in sight, 
We for surely gon na ride. 
This one throughout the night,
