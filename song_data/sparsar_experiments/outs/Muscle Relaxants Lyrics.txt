Muscle Relaxants Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Well hanging out on muscle relaxants.
Trying hard to see the worst that can happen now.
I never know what's holding you up.
And I never know when I'm holding you too much.

Wouldn't you try to find something else to bring you up.
You don't know what you like.
And I could find something else to bring you up.
You don't know what you like.

The party was worse than imagined.
And I never know when I'm holding you awake.
Never know what you like.
And I never know when I'm holding you too tight.
Never know what you find.
And our hearts will slow thought I know you hold me tight.

Wouldn't you try to find something else to bring you up.
You don't know what you like.
And I could find something else to bring you up.
You don't know what you like.

Wouldn't you try to find something else to bring you up.
You don't know what you like.
And I could find something else to bring you up.
You don't know what you like.
