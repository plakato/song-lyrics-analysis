Rwhisky Champ-Nothing Last Forever.
I remember the day,it was my birthday and she told me that,she really need a.
break,later that day she broke it down to me,she called me and told me it was.
over damn,i think... i made the biggest mistake for falling inlove with.
you,never realised everything come to an end yeah,i thought we could last.
forever,but we didn't last forever,everything had come to an end feeling like.
i am a broken,but i'm not a broken soul,later that night i caught you kissing.
with my homie,i understand the life of groupies,you are just a groupy and.
nothing else special.
