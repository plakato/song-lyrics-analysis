Atomic Roar Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

See the light of oppression.
Talk to the witches because.
We've broken the sword of salvation.
Finery rain is falling.
No one knows how it will be.
In disaster and disease.
Atomic Roar.
Destroying the souls.
Destroying their lives.
March of the night.
Marches on.
Who can stop him riding?
See the circles of his bows.
Death of steel and iron.
Blowing like a storm.
Enemies of living black.
Children of their souls.
Burning back you and me.
Who want to be free?
Darkness comes before midnight.
Fire burning out of hell.
Have you seen the nation?
Here comes atomic roar.
No one knows how it will be.
In disaster and disease.
Atomic Roar.
Destroying the souls.
Destroying their lives.
March of the night.
Marches on.
See the light of oppression.
Talk to the witches because.
We've broken the sword of salvation.
Finery rain is falling.
No one knows how it will be.
In disaster and disease.
Atomic Roar.
Destroying the souls.
Destroying their lives.
March of the night.
Marches on.
Who can stop him riding?
See the circles of his bows.
Death of steel and iron.
Blowing like a storm.
Enemies of living black.
Children of their souls.
Burning back you and me.
Who want to be free?
