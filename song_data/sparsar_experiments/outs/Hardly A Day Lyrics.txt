Hardly A Day Lyrics
by QED.

Hardly a day goes: by

Hardly a day goes by hardly a day goes by

All. The candles are still burning
Like, they were the final day
And. I know the world will turn until tomorrow
Will the candles be burning. Then, if they're still today, 

Hardly a day goes by on night falls
All. The sun comes in the early birds come'live
If. You could read my mind from your world
All. The seeds have left a dream, all walk, alone

Hardly a day goes by

Hardly a day goes by

Feel the fire through the darkness
Should. I turn and walk away. 
I believe the turn will call for a tomorrow
And, a dream of eternity, but it's still today

Hardly a day goes by on night falls
All the sun comes in the early birds come'live
If. You could read my mind from your world
All. The seeds have left a dream, all walk, alone

Hardly a day goes by

Hardly a day goes by hardly a day goes by

Hardly a day, goes by
I've been lost inside a moment for too long
Hardly a day goes by on night. Fall
I'Ve been lost inside a moment for too long

Hardly a day goes by
