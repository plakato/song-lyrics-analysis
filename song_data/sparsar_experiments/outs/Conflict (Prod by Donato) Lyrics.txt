Conflict (Prod by Donato) Lyrics
by Xavier.


And in case you ain't know I'm the one.
Tryna aim for the top with my gun.
Now watch my gun as I PLOW!
These niggas ducking like birds I fly like and I might.
Throw shade like a limelight.
Nigga, I rhyme tight.
Nigga, I'm too cold for this weather.
I'm gonna keep getting better and better it's never ending.

Yet, I know a lot of y'all didn't know it exists.
I took a short break then told y'all all I need.
Then spent about 4 months tryna figure out the real me.
Well you see.
Here I am.
You couldn't be more closer like that Goapele track.
I've been going through some motions.

I've been battling myself.
Xavier thinks of quitting yet Xavier wants some help.
He wants to be the best but his best is not enough.
He's got doubt in His heart and conflict in his blood.

And my girl might be the one that keeps me going.
I'm that flower in cement that keeps on growing.
I realize that I don't ever wish for the time back.
Except for when I'm partying and the dream don't reach the climax.
I've been having talks with the devil in the mirror.
The path that I've been taking is something I'm scared of.
With all the parties and the drinking smoke a little bit of weed.
X never thought that X would be the one planting this seed.
Far detached from my roots but I'm tryna grow green.
And I've seen too many niggas like me kill their dreams.
I know I could be my biggest Enemy Number 1.
The thoughts in my head saying I can't be like the sun.
But like the wind blowing all my seeds out the dust.
I often wonder if I'm losing God's trust.
He's giving me His best when my best not enough.

Y'all gonna openly hear me pray.
For real.
