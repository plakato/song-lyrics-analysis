When The Day Is Over Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

When the day is over.
Love that's ever closer.
So let it run and break into my life.
Take my hand and cover me with love.

When the fallen angel.
Takes the final standing.
And fades away so I can.
See the light I'll walk on through and.
Nothing pulls me down.

Through the tears and.
Battle cries I can feel your love.
And the years of blood and.
Pain Fade away, fade away.

Memories unwanted.
Dark the poison tasted.
I'm sorry now so break into.
My life O take my hand and.
Cover me with love.
