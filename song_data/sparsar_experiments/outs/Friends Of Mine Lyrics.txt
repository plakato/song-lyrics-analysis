Friends Of Mine Lyrics
by The Zombies.

When we're all in a crowd.
And you catch her eye.
And then you both smile.
I feel so good inside.
And when I'm with her.
She talks about you.
The things that you say.
The things that you do.

It feels so good to know two people.
So in love....
So in love....

They are friends of mine.

They are friends of mine.

And they've got something.

It's so hard to find.

They are friends of mine.

They are friends of mine.

And they've got something.

You don't often find.

She takes your hand.
When the world stays outside.
That's something to see.
That's nothing to hide.

And when I feel bad.
When people disappoint me.
That's when I need you two.
To help me believe.

It feels so good to know two people.
So in love....
So in love....

They are friends of mine.

They are friends of mine.

And they've got something.

It's so hard to find.

They are friends of mine.

They are friends of mine.

And they've got something.

You don't often find.

It feels so good to know two people.
So in love....
So in love....

They are friends of mine.

They are friends of mine.

And they've got something.

It's so hard to find.

They are friends of mine.

They are friends of mine.

And they've got something.

You don't often find.

Joyce and Terry.
Paul and Molly.
Liz and Brian.
Joy and David.
Kim and Maggie.
June and Daffy.
Jean and Jim.
And Jim and Christine....
