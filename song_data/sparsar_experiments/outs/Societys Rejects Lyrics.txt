Societys Rejects Lyrics
by Unholy Homies.

Abusing drugs used for date rape.
Unholy THIRDD eye sharp like a switch blade.
A walking pharmacy and honestly none you niggas harming me.
WE ALREADY ROBBED THE FUCKIN ARMORY.
Fast life couldn't even stop me wit the po'up.
But I can get way more sedated if you roll up.
Whole 6 to the face hoping I don't throw up.
BITCH SAID SHE ONT SUCK DICK I TOLD HER GROW UP.
It was appirittion if you NIggas had saw ME.
And if it ain't rosebank you niggas is corny.
We be where the hoes stank sippin on a fortyy.
We pop tabs and roll dank you niggas is boring.
Resurrect ya mind from the essence.
Refrain from stressing.
Move wit third eye lid protection.
That's why i Blastclips off reflex.
Society's rejects.
The governments a system bout time we press reset.
Ya church lying to nigga fuck what ya priest said.
Decapitate my dome I come back wit three heads.

I'm barred out call ya bluff pull ya.
Card out.
Hotboxin now whip hella fogged out.
Hard to gain fans when ya rhymes pretty far out.
I ain't have a L WE WAS STILLL TAKING CARS OUT.
Comin down ya block on a bike like debo.
Pull up snatch everything nigga even ya ego.
In the hood like an engine.
Extort ya grandma for her pension.
Open up ya mind maybe learn about ascension.
On a fly estate wit a Greek bitch fencin.
Leave the senator bloody than I peel on em.
Bring down the government shaq oneal on em.
Ya system better be reek proof.
Cause if I seap threw I'll leave this whole shit see through.
If you don't bend reality we'll never be equal.
