Gordon Paul Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

Let's travel under the floorboards.
Let's sing to the curtains.
We are all carpeted.
We are all painted.
We're becoming the walls of this house.
So let's burn down.

I am a window.
I am transparent.
I am the air in which you are standing.

We are the lawn.
And we will exist when this house is gone.

We're not scared, though we should be scared.
Our voices fill the house then out the windows.
Into the yard where smoke and grass are holding our hands.
And we're not alone in our interests.
Inside the rooms that connect us.

We will become everything, we'll shatter as the doorbell rings.
We will become everything, we'll shatter as the doorbell rings.

We're moved in.
Ad peeling.
The layers.
Of skin we drag around.

Burning.
The kindling.
The embers.
They make a simple sound.

The stone walls.
Are sweating.
And our friends.
Are dancing in the dark.

The friction.
Brings a reaction.
And this house.
Was waiting for the spark.
