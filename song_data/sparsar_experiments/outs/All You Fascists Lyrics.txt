All You Fascists Lyrics
by Woody Guthrie.

I'm gonna tell you fascists.
You may be surprised.
The people in this world.
Are getting organized.
You're bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.

Race hatred cannot stop us.
This one thing we know.
Your poll tax and Jim Crow.
And greed has got to go.
You're bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.

All of you fascists bound to lose:.
I said, all of you fascists bound to lose:.
Yes sir, all of you fascists bound to lose:.
You're bound to lose! You fascists:.
Bound to lose!

People of every color.
Marching side to side.
Marching â€˜cross these fields.
Where a million fascists dies.
You're bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose!

I'm going into this battle.
And take my union gun.
We'll end this world of slavery.
Before this battle's won.
You're bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose!
