HMC Lyrics
by Woop.


Geek up on these niggas like I took a gram with molly.
Geek up on these niggas like I caught another body.
Geek up on these niggas like I'm rollin' gangsta exotic.
Geek up on these niggas, geek up on these, geek up on these.
Holy moly choppa, I been playing with the rifle.
Holy moly, tat-tat! Holy moly, tat-tat!

The stripper booty cheeky you know lil Uzi clap niggas clap niggas.
In a stick-up with some mouse cause you know we trap niggas.
Rock out Uzi, one nigga, two pistols.
Young niggas, three pop, two cookers in the kitchen.
Pull up on a fuck nigga, heard he want beef.
Too much sneak dissing, I'm just dissing on the sneak.
Shoot him in the ear, bang bang, Dre Beats.
Fuck 12, fuck county, fuck O.P.D..
Keys in my car but it's a push start.
I can pull up when it's dark or even broad day, though.
I own so much cars, my respect is a bar code.
I'd rather thumb through a check and sit next to my rifle.
Pull up to your trap with three Thai hoes.
Then I chop the brick like Tae Kwon Do.
BItch I keep like them 9's like I'm Rondo!
Pull up in an unknown John Doe!

Kickin' with the choppa, I be ?
Choppa made in Japan, kick-kicking at your ass.
Break the Swisher Sweet down and fill it up with swag.
Red bottoms with pounds and MCM book bags.
Ice on my shoes, no styling.
Paid that nigga fuck boy, fuck for the free.
Trap booming hard, boy you can get a key.
Trap booming hard, sell you 33 a piece.
Word to my niggas, we the lords.
Sharks in the trap house, snakes in the yard.
I'm getting purple pounds in the slums.
Fuck what he did, why he came and where he from.
Hello, you my friend. I know you my friend..
Claim you ain't friendly but friendly as fuck.
Choppa chop shop, I'm choppin' 'em up.
Take a crack rock and cuttin' it up.
Take a Gucci button down and button 'em up.
No more fake friends, you fucking ?
Black hearse wagon, you can't even drive it.
Holy moly choppa, running with the rifle.
