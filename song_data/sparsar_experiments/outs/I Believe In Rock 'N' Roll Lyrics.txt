I Believe In Rock 'N' Roll Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Oh, yeah!

Check it out.
I pledge allegiance to the flag.
Of the united states of rock.
And to the point of view for which it stands.
One music under one god.
Yes, even god loves rock 'n' roll.
With liberty and justice for all lands.

Every day.
I work so hard.
Every day.
I'm dealt the cards.
Every day.
I'm told exactly what to do.
Every day.
I lose control.
Every day.
I rock 'n' roll.
Every day.
It's gonna help to see me through.

I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.

Do you take this music.
To be your lawfully wedded rock.
To have and hold in sickness and in health.
For richer or for poorer.
For better or for worse.
Together until death comes to yourself?

Every day.
I work so hard.
Every day.
I'm dealt the cards.
Every day.
I'm told exactly what to do.
Every day.
I lose control.
Every day.
I rock 'n' roll.
Every day.
It's gonna help to see me through.

I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.

Sister says:.
Oh, would that my words were written down.
Would that they were inscribed on a record.
That with an iron fist and led zeppelin.
They were cut in the rock forever.
But as for me, I know that heavy metal lives.
And that it will at last stand forth upon the dust.
That I myself shall see.
My own ears not another's shall behold it.
And from my flesh I shall see it rock.
My inmost being is consumed with longing.
This is the word of the rocker.

I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
I believe in rock 'n' roll.
