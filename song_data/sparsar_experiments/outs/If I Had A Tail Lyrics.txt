If I Had A Tail Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.

Giuchie, Giuchie.
Oh la la.
Do run run.
You won't get far.

I'm machine.
I'm obsolete.
In the land of the free.
Lobotomy.

I wanna suck, I wanna lick.
I wanna grind, I wanna spit.
Tears of pleasure.
Tears of pain.
They trickle down your face the same.

It's how you look.
Not how you feel.
The city of glass.
With no heartâ€¦

If I had a tail.
I'd own the night.
If I had a tail.
I'd swat the flies.
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh.
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh.

Giuchie, Giuchie.
Oh la la.
Doo run run.
You won't get far.

Animals in.
The midnight zone.
When you own the world.
You're always home.
Get your hands dirty.
Roll up them sleeves.
Brainwashed or true believers.
Buy flash cars.
Diamond rings.
Expensive holes to bury things.

I'm machine.
I'm obsolete.
In the land of the free.
Immortality.

See me dancing on the scars?
See me dance?
