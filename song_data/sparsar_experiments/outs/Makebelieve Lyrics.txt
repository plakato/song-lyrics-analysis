Makebelieve Lyrics
by Volume.

Do you ever feel like an animal.
Which am I to you.
Do you feel like crawling.
Outside your skin tonight.
Sometimes I do....

Caged inside a zoo.
Locked inside of you.
Yeah.
Come fly off on a trip of makebelieve.
Makebelieve....
Makebelieve in me tonight.

Feels good to let it soar.
Feels good to let it roar.
Sometimes I do.

Inside a difference in mind.
Yeah.
Come fly off on a trip of makebelieve.

Yeah....

Come fly off on a trip of makebelieve.
Makebelieve....
Makebelieve in me tonight.

Feels good to let it soar.
Feels good to let it roar.
Sometimes I do.

Inside a difference in mind.
Come fly off on a trip of makebelieve.

Sit inside your dresser mirror.
Taking in your secret image.
Can't you feel your body screaming.
Stand up now and jump out screaming.
Singing songs of makebelieve.
Can't you feel your body screaming.
Stand up now and jump out screaming.
Organs in me singing songs.
Singing songs of makebelieve.
Can't you feel your body screaming.
Stand up now and jump out screaming.
