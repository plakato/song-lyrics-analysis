Hv Gutter, if you wan na get technical with it, my nigga I'm

Precise lyricism, hear the rhythm fear. The gifted lil nigga swear to god, ima

Riding for the city P-Town. Here with me, nigga get trippy like 2050/ .

Writin since 5th grade nigga I'mma get paid. Why you tryna get cool, I be in the
next lane who the fuck is you 
 ... to you, hating ass niggas, I'm the root of all evil/ .
 watch, I'm bouta stunt on you, niggas like evil, Knievel/, 
I'm, packin that diesel and Mackin
