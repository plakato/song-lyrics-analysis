Ready to Die Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

I woke up thirsty on an island in the sea.
I woke up hungry with hungry cougars surrounding me.
I hit the soft spot on the soft spot on my head.
It made me tired so I sung from my bed.
I'm ready to die, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to die.

A sword, a switchblade, any way you cut it.
I'm not afraid, i know I'm going to get it.
Oh, maker of such fine products.
As palm trees, and the dead sea.
Don't pardon me, there's nothing rude.
Things conclude, things conclude!

The ghosts got Biggie Small.
sounds like a drill.
The death sweat suits me.
A death threat provides a thrill.
I've seen the world, kissed all the pretty girls.
I've said my goodbyes and now I'm ready to die.
Oh!
