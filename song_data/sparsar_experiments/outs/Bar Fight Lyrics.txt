Bar Fight Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

Am I still a burden to you now?
Am I still a burden?

Am I still a burden to you now?
Fading away from sight and sound.
What will you say when they take me away.
What will you say?

You should have listened.
You should have been more careful.
Your words forced love to crumble.
You should have been more careful.

Now you'll live with regret for the rest of your life.
Gave up when you should have stayed.
Now you'll live with regret for the rest of your life.
Gave up when you should have stayed, this is goodbye.
Goodbye.

It's so simple. When I tried to explain, you didn't believe.
It's so simple. It's so simple.
Oh, why do people run? Let's not live life this way.
Let's not live life this way.

What was the purpose of your destruction?

Will you sleep sound at night?
I kept begging for the answers.
You could not seem to reply.
You could have saved a life.

Now you'll live with regret for the rest of your life.
Gave up when you should have stayed.
Now you'll live with regret for the rest of your life.
Gave up when you should have stayed.

It's so simple. When I tried to explain, you didn't believe.
It's so simple. It's so simple.
Oh, why do people run? Let's not live life this way.
Let's not live this way.

How could you be so naive?
Not even death could save you from me.
Not even death could save you from me.
I tried and tried to show you the light.
You could have saved a life.

It's so simple. When I tried to explain.
You didn't believe.
It's so simple.

Oh, why do people run? Let's not live life this way.
Let's not live life this way.
Oh, why do people run? Let's not live life this way.
I just wanted you to stay.
It's so simple. When I tried to explain, you didn't believe.
It's so simple. It's so simple.
Oh, why do people run?
Let's not live life this way.
