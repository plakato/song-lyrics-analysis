Limitless Lyrics
by Volumes.

Only time will tell.
A miss for a match.
I think you've found the niche.
Now I am twenty one.
Young, but still getting older.
Now I've been wanting more.
Than what you have taught me.
To show me the rivers.
Life living underneath a billboard.
The sidewalks infested.
The people of plastic.

Ok, so I've been holding out.
Lying my weight on the door.
Up above, I've never felt so numb.
Until I made it out.
They put a target on your forehead.
The day that you were born.

I've waited my entire life, sitting on the sides.
Everyday I hear you say that it gets easier with time.
A life I never ruined, a light to show me out this time.
And maybe, and maybe I was right all along.
The day you were born, a solid mark.

Do you believe in everything?
Do you believe in everything and everyone you meet?
Do you believe in everything?
Do you believe in everything and everyone you see?

The day you were born, a solid mark written on your forehead.
