Fortune Fades Lyrics
by Wrinkle Neck Mules.

Shaking off the shadows.
Running from the cold.
Waters churn and beckon at my door.
Tainted streams are flowing.
Where the transom used to be.
Take me down with the vessel when you go.

Fortune fades.
You're reaching for the light.
Brighter days are falling far behind.
When your hole is dug so deep.
And it's so dark you can't see.
The winds will always bring you home to me.

Concrete and the pilings.
Driving deep beneath the sea.
Amongst the rising waves and finer things.
Heavens to Betsy, to be a pearl upon a string.
Resting on your shoulder eternally.

Fortune fades.
You're reaching for the light.
Brighter days are falling far behind.
When your hole is dug so deep.
And it's so dark you can't see.
The winds will always bring you home to me.

No time for winding down.
Where I wind up is on my mind.
Surely there's more silver sides to see.
No time to count the miles.
Counting them up just brings me down.
Looks like we've been leaking gasoline.

Fortune fades.
You're reaching for the light.
Brighter days are falling far behind.
When your hole is dug so deep.
And it's so dark you can't see.
The winds will always bring you home to me.
