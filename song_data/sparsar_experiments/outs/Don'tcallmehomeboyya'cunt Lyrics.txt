Don'tcallmehomeboyya'cunt Lyrics
by Blood Duster.

I ain't no fuckin' hood.
Don't call me brother.
Cos that ain't no good.
And got homies to call my own.
Ain't got no gun.
And I live at home.
Don't call me home boy.
I wear sharp threads.
That much is true.
And I can't rap and neither can you.
I'm not down or fly or dope.
But I play metal and swing a rope.
Don't call me home boy.
Yo'.
