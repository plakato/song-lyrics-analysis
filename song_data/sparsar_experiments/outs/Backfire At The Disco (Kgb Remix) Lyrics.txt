Backfire At The Disco (Kgb Remix) Lyrics
by The Wombats.

It's 8 o'clock and I'm feeling fine.
I'm out on a date tonight.
In a candle lit restaurant down by the riverside.

Everything's going alright, I guess.
She took down my number and home address.
Everything was going perfectly until.

It backfired at the disco.
She slapped me at the disco.
I did something I'll never forget.

It was a chat-up line built not to impress.
More a sleazy remark on her whorish dress.
My wires crossed like they've never done before.

Well, it's 3 o'clock and I'm feeling shite.
I'm going home alone tonight.
Everything was going perfectly until.

It backfired at the disco.
She slapped me at the disco.
I did something I'll never forget.

It backfired at the disco.
We were dancing at the disco.
I made a move when it was well out of context.
1, 2, 3, 4.

Well, it backfired at the disco.
We were dancing at the disco.
Yeah, it backfired at the disco.
When you slapped me at the disco.

Yeah, it backfired at the disco.
We were dancing at the disco.
Yeah, it backfired at the disco.
When you slapped me at the disco.
