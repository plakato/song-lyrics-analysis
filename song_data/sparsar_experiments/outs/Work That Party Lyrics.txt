Work That Party Lyrics
by Viva Fidel.

Let me see you work that body.
Do you know how to rock the party?
4x.

Work that room.
Clap ya hands.
Get on the floor.
And do that dance.
Hands in the air if you love ya life.
Release ya fear.
At least for night.
Move in closer.
Touch and go.
She like it fast.
But she like it slow.
They all love to show their body.
But do you really know how to rock the party?

Let me see you work that body.
Do you know how to rock the party?
4x.

Professional, but like a pro.
You ain't gotta ask cause you already know.
VIP come with me and JG.
This ain't for all eyes to see.
We got more for everybody.
But ya gotta know how to to work that party.

Let me see you work that body.
Do you know how to rock the party?
4x.

Gimmie one more shot and im audi.
But we got get one more hottie.
And she gotta know how to work that body.
And she be scared to work a party.

Let me see you work that body.
Do you know how to rock the party?
4x.
