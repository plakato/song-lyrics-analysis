Classic Lyrics
by Punkstah.


Getting ready for combat I've gone back to the classics
Bringing, the golden hype listening to rap since class six
Its fantastic. What i do is magic and It's Drastic
All you newbies are dramatic and my flow is bombastic
Rakim said Timeless. So age, don't count in the booth
When. Your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Its, the classic its timeless i've felt better than i ever been
Wait. Hol up, spitting bullshit is beyond a mortal sin
Back to my roots. No school like old school
Making. The best of the best is my only rule
Learned from the legends cus. I saw them grow
Ain't talkin international, its bout, my own country yo
Why, would i make fake shit when i talk about the truth
Music pulled me up now, its my time to contribute
I've packed up my bags. Its a long way to go
I chose music over everything in ma blood. It flows

Bepar shepar old school, I'm keepin', it classic
Amar shamne your shit, its fucking harassing
So side, akhon, punkstah, mic e
Shobai uira, jabe, jokhn, shuru, hobe amar, lyrical gameplay
Monojogi ami monojog, diye kheli
Ar oi shomoy toder chinta, amare, kamne, topkabi
Topkanor, chinta baad de tor, theke onk upore
Dhorte parbi na parbi. Na sathe bhai brothers ase
Past ar present er kotha niya banaitesi future
Amar joints gula tight ar mota thoughts, getting deeper
Dekhsi onk back biting dekhi ami onk fakeness
Tai ekai choli ami lagbo na kaure
Lyrically, classically ami toh, pagla
Naam, ki amar, I'm the great punkstah
Khuija dekh khuija dekh arekta pabi na
Jokhn. Ami shuru tora dhula mishha jabi ga
Yeah tora, dhula, mishha, jabi, ga
Jokhn, ami shuru, tora dhula, mishha jabi
Its, classic its fantastic
