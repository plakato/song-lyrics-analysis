Love Drunk Lyrics
by Sworn In.

Been here before again and again.
Seen it before I know how this ends.
My heart than yours.
It drips than it pours.
Till it seeps into the wooden floors.
But I adore the way it feels.
To switch when I don't feel real.
And I'll watch you suffer too.
So don't feel bad for what you do.

I've watched you stab away at my heart.
And baby it's my favorite part.
Make me feel miserable like you always do.
Make me fall in love with you.

Oh babe I'm just a little love drunk.
But just enough to fill the space.

Now it's your turn feel.
What it's like to not be real.
Don't worry babe just part of the deal.

I don't need it anymore.
Fuck yes I do.
I need every little part of you.
No wait, burn in hell.
I have a secret to tell.

Oh babe I'm just a little love drunk.
But just enough to fill the space.

Oh babe my heart feels so numb.
So top me off just in case.

My secrets this.
Listen up it's not something to miss.
I've been so fucked from the devil's pretty little kiss.
Now it's your turn feel.
What it's like to not be real.
Don't worry babe just part of the deal.

Rewind, rewind.
Play it over again.
Sing me a song about being dead.
Rewind, rewind.
It's your turn this time.
Sing me a song about blood red wine.

Oh babe I'm just a little love drunk.
But just enough to fill the space.

Oh babe my heart feels so numb.
So top me off just in case.
