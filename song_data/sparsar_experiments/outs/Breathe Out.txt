Breathe Out
by The Zombies.

Argent.

The city's sitting pretty.
A warm summer wind.
Seems to promise something special tonight.
There's a look in your eye.
And I want to be part of you.
Make it all right.
Later tonight.
We can go to the river.
Watch the sun go down.
Catch a little music in flight.
Let our hearts swell with pride.
And the feelings inside of us.
Make it all right.
Later tonight.

Breathe out, breathe in.
Tonight we win.
Say goodbye to tomorrow.
And here let the story begin.

Won't you look at the evening.
Spread out to the sky.
It really is a wonderful sight.
As the stars in their millions.
Emerge from vermilion.
Deepening light.
I'll love you tonight.
We can roll with the music.
Get lost in the sound.
Stay until the break of daylight.
In this life we are living.
We dance to the rhythm.
And make it all right.
However we might.

Breathe out, breathe in.
Tonight we win.
Catch the stars as they're falling.
And here let the story begin.

Breathe out, breathe in.
Tonight we win.
Catch the stars as they're falling.
Treasure the light.
Let it shine on our freedom.
This wonderful sight.
We can live with the rhythm.
As long as we learn to.
Breathe out, breathe In.
Breathe out, breathe in.
