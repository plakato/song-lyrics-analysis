The driving test Lyrics
by QUAZ SWAGGER.

Baby I can take youre keys ond youre ride and test drive it.
Cause you know I work in profession when I ride it.
I ride it up,and ride it down,get a little nasty.
Make a uturn to see how longer it can last me.
Classy,s-o-s,niggas say that im the best.
Have youre moter still running hard when ive done the test.
This is is quaz checking off now you figure the rest.
