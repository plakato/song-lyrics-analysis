Last Supper Lyrics
by Quanche.

Narrative 
Throughout history, many extremely creative people have been exceptionally
prone to procrastination. 
There are stories of authors, actors, inventors, politicians, artists, etc, 
All having bouts of procrastination so obvious and problematic that it was
recorded for me to read about hundreds of years after 
The. Most interesting and surprising example of these stories is Leonardo, da
Vinci, 
Arguably, the most intelligent and ingenious man in history. 
This is a man who said he regrets never having completed a single work, 
 
You either looking for the Christ or the Anti 
I'm. Just looking for the shit to make my head high 
Looking for the next up to make rank, I 
Got these motherfuckers by a landslide 
I'm about to break a few ankles. You get the picture. I'Ma take a few angles: 
Take it for just a fucking, mixtape, I'ma, murder, shit and leave. You can light a
few candles. 
It shouldn't be a problem, yet they looking at me sideways and they talk about
fam. But man. We ain't from the same stitch. 
I spend more money when I save more time, so I don't really spend alot of time
with my bitch 
That's prolly. Why she ain't with me. Few haters got a few barrels aimed at me: 
And. We almost there
