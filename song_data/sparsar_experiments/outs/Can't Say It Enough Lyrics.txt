Can't Say It Enough Lyrics
by Vivian Green.

Love is a beautiful thing.
It's more rare.
Than a diamond ring.
So if you find it.
Try to keep it.
Be strong together.
Cause you'll need it.

Things don't work out.
All the time.
Some of the greatest.
Loves don't stay together.
Could be yours.
And minds.
Cause I was taught.
Never say never.
But if we ever.
Went our separate ways.
I know I loved enough.
To last all my days.
Cause this is so right.
And now I can't find.
Enough ways to.
Say it no.

I can't say it enough.
Theirs nothin' like.
Your love.
I keep tryna find.
New ways to say.
But I love you baby.
And nothin' can change it.
No, no, no.

We could be poor.
On the streets.
With no food to eat.
Nothin' but the.
Warmth of our bodies.
We could be.
Miles away.
For months at a time.
The distance.
Wouldn't break us.
We could be.
Filthy rich together.
I wouldn't love you.
No better.
Than I do right now.
I can't find enough.
Ways to say it.
But I love you.

I can't say it enough.
Theirs nothin' like.
Your love.
I keep tryna find.
New ways to say.
But I love you baby.
And nothin' can change it.
No, no, no.

Cause love.
Is a beautiful thing.
It's more rare.
Than a diamond ring.
So if you find it.
Try to keep it.
Be strong together.
Cause you'll need it.

When times get rough.
You can't give up.
Cause nothings.
More important.
Than your love.
Your love.

I can't say it enough.
Theirs nothin' like.
Your love.
I keep tryna find.
New ways to say.
But I love you baby.
And nothin' can change it.
No, no, no.

I can't say it enough.
Theirs nothin' like.
Your love.
I keep tryna find.
New ways to say.
But I love you baby.
And nothin' can change it.
No, no, no.

I can't say it enough.
I can't say it enough.
I can't say it enough.
I can't say it enough.
