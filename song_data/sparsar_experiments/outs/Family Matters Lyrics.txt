Family Matters Lyrics
by TygaStan212.

Uh Bitch i rhyme like im steve urkel.
When i rhyme you ain't gonna poke yo head out like a turtle.
Squirtle is gonna run from me.
Cuz im ash ketchum in this bitch.
I'ma leave all ya'll pokemon in stitches.
Then ima repair your pokeballs with wrenches.
Brock is a fucking faggot and i said it so myself.
That black piece of shit couldn't rap himself out of tinfoil.
His mother is a fucking slut who is a cunt.
She can't rap better than me unless her fucking name is Nicki.
Im a raw lyricist better than hopsin bitch.
I'ma skin all the emcees trying to face me.
Till they get a nose bleed from being in the sky seats.
Looking down on me from heaven.
Bitch Pakyed is fucking elven.
And hes still queer.
Im gonna drive a john deer into a fucking tree.
And then skin my fucking knee.
