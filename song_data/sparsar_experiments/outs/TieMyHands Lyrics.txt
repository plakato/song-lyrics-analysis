TieMyHands Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


The Summer....
Of 89 had put a shine on a shaded savior.
Since we've been coming for your necks like a shaving razor.

Who's greater?
Im seeing signs like its Gang Related.
So we ran a train on the game &amp; came a great creation.

If that ain't a beautiful sin, well then.
Within your midnight dreary.
I'll find you leering towards this 3rdiiiTheory; Steering.
You niggas in the right directions;.
More like possessions.
My lyrics body snatching many...niggas.
Like Jack Finney.

In thee...case of what the fuck adults expect of me.
Im living like I have about a year of life expectancy.
No limits living, or no timid spirits.
We out to get it, &amp; give some new shit.
Flow off some Flu shit.
Sick &amp; fluid.

Tune in!
In this cold word, the Uth lives in June &amp;.
When the world blooms, its cuz we plant the seeds, Im assumin'.
Now the dopiest shit on these grounds like a pair of Patrick Ewings.
Though , we all went under like Jordan balling with Lonney Tunes.
So....

Beatrix Aku, Ragz Bastard, Moshpit Molly.
My soul is underground.
Yes my soul is underground music!
Soul is underground, yes my soul is underground..

My soul is underground.
Yes my soul is underground.
And it begins.
My soul is underground.
Yes my soul is underground.
Now Tie My Hands.
My soul is underground.
Yes my soul is underground.
Throw me in.
My soul is underground....
And start digging.

Tie my hands I can't do no harm.
Milking the rhymes to you squares.
Im a lucky charm.
Got the... world in my palms.
While im puffin on palms.
Making songs, hittin bongs.
Straight A kid gone wrong.

What the fuck is going on these days?
You getting played.
While Lume is getting paid.
Advocate for you to vacate the premises.
When I enter the booth im the mics nemisis.

Just an up incoming poet with no limits.
17, Sippin moet with 4 women.
Like a cobra with mo venom.
Bars got me in charge.
High up gazing at the damn stars.

Quick venom spit.
With my penmenship.
Can't embellish it.
Raw and dirty how im sellin shit.
Heat it like a kettle, bitch.
When i tell you to; yeah you too.
Tell your friend to come along, I got a bruh whos available.
