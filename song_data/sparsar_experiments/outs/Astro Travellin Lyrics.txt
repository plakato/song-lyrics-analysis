Astro Travellin Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Yo, we flying through your neighborhood in hyperspeed.
Astro travellin off that hydro weed.
I always keep my weeds on deck, smokin la.

Never hittin no coke, that's no joke.
And yo, I don't poke needles in my veins.
I don't be goin for broke.
Strictly haze for days, travellin higher.
Petty people's down, wonderin why I'm so wired.

Cause we astro travellin, smokin sticky green.
Then we mental over madlib instrumentals.

Pull out the water tube.
I got the water jewels.
On the level, then all the negatives seckle.

Tranquility but still on the rugged.
Like a gentle giant unplugged tokin on bud.

Man, I get so high I hope I don't start babblin.
Yo, we astro travellin.

Yo, we flying through your neighborhood in hyperspeed.
Astro travellin off that hydro weed.
I always keep my weeds on deck, smokin la.

Never hittin no coke, that's no joke.
And yo, I don't poke needles in my veins.
I don't be goin for broke.
Strictly haze for days, travellin higher.
Petty people's down, wonderin why I'm so wired.

Cause we astro travellin, smokin sticky green.
Then we mental over madlib instrumentals.

Pull out the water tube. I got the water jewels.
On the level, then all the negatives seckle.

Tranquility but still on the rugged.
Like a gentle giant unplugged tokin on bud.

We astro travellin.
