1st Night Lyrics
by Ty Dolla $ign.


Girl be yo self, ain't nothing wrong with being ratchet.
You fit that ass up in them booty shorts, that's magic.
You in them Alexandra Wang's like Lady Gaga.
You brought some home girls wit you for my partners.
I got some weed, I got some drink, let's turn it up.
I'm feelin you, you feelin me so what the fuck?
We ain't gotta play no games, you know I can't.
And we both gone so girl ain't nothing wrong.

If we fuck on the first night… yea.
If we fuck on the first night… girl.
Don't make me wait.
If we fuck on the first night… yea.

You got that nigga' name tatted on yo body.
So you gonna get it covered with a butterfly or something.
That nigga broke yo fuckin heart, gotten that bitch pregnant.
That's why you used to fuck with girls, almost turned into a lesbian.
Let me put this dick back in yo life and get you right.
You say yo ex nigga never hit it right.
We ain't gotta play no games, you know I can't.
Put them pretty lips on me, says I want you and you want me.

Break it down.
Girl, let me hit it all the 1st night.
Girl I can show you better than I could tell you.
I'mma take yo shirt off and the J's off.
And the jeans off in the bed sure we fuck…
