Light It Up Lyrics
by XO-IQ.


Let's light it up.
Let's see it all around us.
We're one and all.
The fire's gonna guide us.

Look at the sky.
We gonna make it shine so bright ooo.
Get ready now, It's time to put your cellies high.

I wanna feel it.
Light it up, Light it up.
Cause I wanna see it.
Light it up, Light it up.
Light it up for love.
Light it up, light it up.
Light it up for love.
Just light it up, light it up.

Now do you feel the love.
Tonight it's all around us.
We're here tonight.
And no one's gonna stop us.
Look at the sky.
I've never seen it shine so bright, oh.
You're ready now.
Cause Tonight we're gonna.
Get fired up, let's light it up.
I wanna.

I wanna feel it.
Light it up, Light it up.
Cause I wanna see it.
Light it up, Light it up.
Light it up for love.
Light it up, light it up.
Light it up for love.
Just light it up, light it up.

I wanna feel it.
Cause I wanna see it.
Light it up, light it up.
Light it up, light it up.
Light it up for love.

Light it up, light it up.
