The Talk Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.


Coffin for ya thoughts and brought a casket for ya action. 
And reacted to ya cause, but the only satisfaction'll be 
The restin of yall just pay attention 
I'mma be the next one to ball, but never seen a bench 
And since y'all intent on findin. My intent, Lace UP 
Dont join the gang just get ready to run or face up 
Like amare, playin mutombo. This is a mismatch, 
I block the shots, but they won't get sent back 
I catch em. So welcome to the block party starring hannibal drexler 
Monster's. What they sayin beast is what they call me. 
I say they just talkin these
niggas good at talkin 
And. Then I say true story, 
Thats. What y'all niggas do for me, 
Talkin bout, Yung, Milla and couldn't say: nothin realer 
What, they talkin bout Mi. They say he bout 3s 
And. They say he bout, cheese and killin instrumentals with ease 
I, say thats, all true. I do it all for you. 
So return. The favor keep talkin bout ya, dude, 
 
I'm, the talk of the town, 
I'm the-I'm, the talk-talk of the town 
Don't give a fuck what you talking. Unless you talking about me 
Fuck what you talking, unless you talking about me 
Fuck what you talking unless you talking about me, 
Don't, give a fuck what you talking, unless you talking about me 
Fuck, what you talking unless you talking about me, 
Don't, give a fuck what You talking, unless you talking about me, 
 
Boss Royalty, King Emperor, 
Plain,
