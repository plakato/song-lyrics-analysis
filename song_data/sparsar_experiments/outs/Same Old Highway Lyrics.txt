Same Old Highway Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Yeah, I'm gassed up and lead foot and rolling.
I know these roads like the back of my hand.
This not knowing where you're going.
Has got me going just as fast as I can.

Down the same old highway.
Same ditches, same exits, same lines.
But if it's the same old highway.
Oh, why can't I find you tonight?

I'm tired of hitting these dead ends for nothing.
I thought I had found you by now.
And I'm guessing you're helping.
On getting on out of this town.
But the only way out is.

This same old highway.
Same ditches, same exits, same lines.
But if it's the same old highway.
Oh, why can't I find you tonight?

I wish the way that you loved me always stayed the same.
I never would have changed like the lines in these lanes.

The same old highway.
Same ditches, same exits, same lines.
But if it's the same old highway.
Oh, why can't I find you tonight?

Oh, why can't I find you tonight?
