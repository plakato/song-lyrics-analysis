Eyebrow Lyrics
by Yung Neptune (AKA YUNG JZ7).

Self-ghost written.
Prepaid prescriptions.
Self pierced eyebrow like poor self decisions.
Pass the admission ask straight for the snack bin.
Rap game aladdin.

Magical lamps.
Work wonders on pants.
Rhyme tighter with plants.
Light end fuse.
Infuse incense with dank tunes.

Dark times.

Preludes.
