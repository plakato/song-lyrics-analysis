Tipping the Scales Lyrics
by Visionaries.

Ooh ooh ooh .....ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Ooh ooh oooh ooh.

Lie, cheat, steal, kill, certainly the shoes.
I'm not tryin to fill.

Love, live, balance, forgive, God forbid.
I dont properly raise a kid.

Thats overnight success.
I'm all day, I'm not easily fooled.
With what they portray.
Its for the line rate.
The labels of venom.
Syndastry puppets.
Beware of the trumpets.
Hunger for fame heres a full course meal.
Free mason throw out that record deal.
I'm independent with major intentions.
Were cashing in with honorable mentions.
Our glory to God, murder self righteousness.
Most of my associates do agree with this.
So be it, it took time it took time to accept.
Apply to the living then take the step.
Left right in motion, full of devotion.
Pray for a future without corrosion.
Angels all around fixing whats broken.
Too much toastin mixed with boastin.
Emptyness can't be filled with emptyness.
Imagine being on God's guest list.
This world is careless, yes I care.
I'm always open arms for you over there.

Apply the brakes to make a pit stop.
Hip hop blasting out the back to cover the tracks to rot.
Its like you might of rocked the mic alot.
In closed proximity I can tell you lock comminity.
The way you rock mehididty plots.
Minutely gripping the action in a fraction of after thought.
Attacking from the comforts of my home dispatcher.
Special voices from the tone of my voices.
To the drone of my choices.
On my own I can hoist the flags of five.
But the culture of my crew helps me keep hope alive.
Reinform the illen vibes, it gives me strength to survive.
Educated and street wise, elder of the V.I.s.
Or liking and adding the precise of my seven twelveth behives.
The best of best of year is yet to come.
What makes one a better run.
Better run back to the underground.
Where you came from.
Hell no he replied as long as there's a steady rhyme supply.
We keep coming back we won't die.
