Just keep it real with yourself one time:

It's, 2 A.M. and you feel like calling 
I know what you want by the tone that you talking 
Just, get to the point with a boss. 
I got ta' couple shots in me. Yea I'm gone 
Imma' make you feel like we just robbed a bank 
Imma' make you forget that you got ta', get up in the A.M. A.M. 
 
Imma', one of one! That'S why you came through 
Cause. You don't want me fucking with someone who ain't you 
Imma' blow up and see what this fame do. 
If you fuck up Imma' bounce like a kangaroo 
But. I play it cool slide through for the hot one, 
You need drugs. You need advice, yea. I got some 
This is far from the end and far from the beginning, 
This is somewhere in the middle 
Hit, my phone when you slipping 
Damn,

Imma' make you feel like we just robbed a bank 
Imma' make you forget that you got ta', get up in the A.M. A.M. 
 
Yeah, pretty Puerto Rican 
Snapping at the mouth, 
Liquor, love and anger makes your accent come out. 
Better, calm, the fuck down with your attitude 
Cause. I can change your longitude 
And, your fucking latitude 
Put, you on a plane to a place you never been 
I could have you out in Asia, lookin fly spending Yen, 
Better back the fuck up with that rah rah hooblah 
Breath in breath out 
Wooosahhhhh
