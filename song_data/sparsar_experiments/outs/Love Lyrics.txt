Love Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

Forgive me Lord for the times I disgrace myself.
Restore me and I will return.
Your discipline is that which I have known and loved.
Teach me Lord for I long to learn.
O how I need your closeness.
Your words are tender.
Your spirit it sets me free to live.
Free to move in the river of your love.
Know your blessings and know the joy you give.
My shepherd come and cry for me.
Hold my arms as I carry my cross.
To live and to die for you is my hope.
In ya house I know I'll never be lost.

Where love is real.
And love is you.
And life goes on.
Round and round we go.

After I strayed I repented.
After I came to understand my whole heart cried.
I was ashamed when I heard you call my name.
When you ran to meet me with your arms wide.
How my heart was rotten with the sin of my youth.
Till you washed me with tears and made it known.
That you longed for me O my Father.
You sang a love song and made my hurts your own.
What I could never comprehend.
The love and the compassion you have for me.
My God and my King, my Hope and my Friend.

There will be blue skies.
There will be blue skies all around.
We will be shining.
We will be shining like the sun.
