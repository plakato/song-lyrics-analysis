Headswim Lyrics
by Volume.

Save me as I scream back to a place.
That I know too well.
Lights flashing, strapped to a gun.
This reflection is killing me.

Father's eyes are closed.
Yet I still don't know.
Father's eyes are closed.
Yet I still don't know.

The Earth, the sky, the moon screams.
More than passing time.
Is this what I believe.
Or what I've been told.

Father's eyes are closed.
Yet I still don't know.
Father's eyes are closed.
Yet I still don't know.

...What the fuck....

Father's eyes are closed.
Yet I still don't know.
Yeah.

It's been a while since you've been gone.
And I'm still searching for the answers that are not here.
So I looked to the sky for a piece of magic just to soothe my soul.
And I'm fighting the evil that's built up inside and I don't even know if it's.
wrong.

I need some magic to soothe my soul.
I need some magic.
I need some magic....
I need some magic to soothe my soul.
I need some magic to soothe my soul.

I need some magic....
I need some magic to soothe my soul.
I need some magic....

I look around and I know I don't belong.
That's why I'm setting the controls for the center of the sun.

I've been here too long.
Too long.
I've been here too long....
Too long....

Into the sun we fly.
Into the sun I'm gone.
