Maybe Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

I am left with nothing else to say.
Hearts are broken almost every day.
Things aren't yours unless you pay for them.
We're looking for another empty day.
But in between.
Yeah I have seen.
Maybe I promised.
Maybe I lied.
Maybe I promised.
But there are things that change in my mind.
