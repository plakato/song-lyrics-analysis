Let's Lurk Lyrics
by 67.


Still pulling up on smoke.
Skeng in my pocket, can't you see the bulge in my coat?
Like Hollow Meets Blade, manaman got guns that'll sink down a boat.
Send a young boy round with a skeng, they ain't leaving till they see smoke.

My niggas the realest in town, you niggas are really some jokes.
Feds locked bro watching EastEnders, it's a fucking joke.
Trapping ain't dead, the nitty still clucking and ringing my phone.

Chilling with bro, talking 'bout money, dough to the dome.

Turn up on your block, ten toes, man will do it, no plan, man will do it, no.
plan.
In four-door trucks, I took risks, man, soon gon' bring out the chopper in.
the van.
I was in the trap on Snapchat watching everybody turn up mad.
Can't lie, that shit got me mad but I was hugging up all them bands.
Just done road with Snoopy , bare Uncle Fest and amm.
Got my face all droopy, bro got guwop.
like Gucci.
See him in Stoney, not Gucci.
The ops used to laugh at my truck but they cut when they see that hooptie.

Whip that skeng out the coat, watch it sink like Susie.

Still pulling up, no messing.
67, my brothers.
Spare No 1 for my bredrins.
Bitches be loving the gang.
You see it all over my mentions.
Put things in the car, let's lurk.
We ain't looking for normal pedestrians.
How you gonna do man dirty?
Got things on things and we lurky.
Get bricks on bricks from the plug.
Cause you know that my team's certy.

How you gonna do man dirty?
Got things on things and we lurky.
Get bricks on bricks from the plug.
Cause you know that my team's certy.

I've got mad hate for the undies.
Moving like gyal, tryna cuff me.
44 spin, that's rusty.
And the corn is chunky.
More time, I be in the trap.
With Chris Brown and Rita Ora.
All the in and outs.
To go hit the cells, it's hot like a sauna.
So I switch the trap.
Flip the packs, I need all the mula.
Wah gwan for the judge?
Done the mandem dirty.
Free up my young G Pulloff.
Chopper on the ride, that's lengthy.
Fifty shot, the skeng's full up.
Niggas do the dash when man pull up.

Still outside drilling.
Bro's came home from the jail, bought him a phone, then he made him a.
killing.
Ops dem know where the hill is , they ain't come around here.
Raise both arms up figure eight, that's two 44s in the air.
How you gonna do man dirty?  Bro.
whips that grub, man a whip that skeng.
Got me feeling like Shirley.
Went from a 25 shot to a 50 shot.
We don't know about 30s.
Any time I phone my plug.
Better know that call's nothing less than a birdie.
Put skengs in the car, then I phone my bro like let's get lurky.

Still pulling up, no messing.
67, my brothers.
Spare No 1 for my bredrins.
Bitches be loving the gang.
You see it all over my mentions.
Put things in the car, let's lurk.
We ain't looking for normal pedestrians.
How you gonna do man dirty?
Got things on things and we lurky.
Get bricks on bricks from the plug.
Cause you know that my team's certy.
How you gonna do man dirty?
Got things on things and we lurky.
Get bricks on bricks from the plug.
Cause you know that my team's certy.

Get lowdown, tell a man straight.
Man already know, 67 and H.
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, man rolled up.
Three .45, 67, man ate.
Man just rolled up, pepper then doughnut.
Two 45s then severed man's plates.
Man's just colder, everyone load up.
Cause in this jungle, everyone's apes.
I want everyone's cake.
Man play hero? Bury man's cape.
And there's bare subliminal riders.
So what's everyone saying?
And man ain't even known these games.
But I noticed everyone's playing.
And I don't even need no soldiers.
Man know Hollowman's spraying.
I've never really been on that running shit.
Niggas know Hollowman's staying.
And way before all of this money shit.
Niggas knew Hollowman's name.
They love it when I come on this gully shit.
Niggas know Hollowman's lane.
They know a nigga bring that next level shit.
Nigga, call me Hollowman Saiyan.

Still pulling up, no messing.
67, my brothers.
Spare No 1 for my bredrins.
Bitches be loving the gang.
You see it all over my mentions.
Put things in the car, let's lurk.
We ain't looking for normal pedestrians.
How you gonna do man dirty?
Got things on things and we lurky.
Get bricks on bricks from the plug.
Cause you know that my team's certy.
How you gonna do man dirty?
Got things on things and we lurky.
Get bricks on bricks from the plug.
Cause you know that my team's certy.
