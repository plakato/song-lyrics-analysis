Fun Freestyles #1 Lyrics
by Twrocks.

The ice caps are melting, let's see what this hell brings.
Polar bears are drowning, some Pakistani shells ring.
Pakyed shooting feds, the little fuck, I'll smack him dead.
Blood stains turn a darker red, hang him without fuckin' pegs.
Watch your face turn crimson red, like an acid head.
Infrared vision, listen, bitch, you'll get your ass imprisoned.
With my rhymes and my flow, I'll end you with collision.
I'm a warn you cause science often lacks fuckin' precision.
The ice caps are melting as a result of our decisions.
It's probably the overuse of electrical equipment.
Listen, hear that, bombs droppin' in the distance.
God, hear my prayers, I pray for peace in Pakistan.
Hear all these voices, we're erupting like an avalanche.
From man to man to land to land, let's just have a laugh.
Shouldn't have to write this shit in fuckin' paragraphs.
It's paraphrasing, keep it short in this mini freestyle.
Can you see you now? No, cause your ass is fuckin' senile.
Meanwhile, looks like we're livin' in the sea now.
This shit's foul but it's how we have to live now.
Farmers without sheep to feed, babies with no life to lead.
I'm rappin' on this guillotine, Lord, my soul I pray to keep.
Goin' off of topic, clearly eager to cheat.
I know I'm fuckin' sicker than a period leak.
Goin' to the cinema but I steal the seats.
No reason to be fuckin' easily deceived.
But now I'm rappin' 'bout some random shit to the beat.
Give me more topics and a fuckin' reason to breathe.
Give me a mic, some rhymes and a bit of fresh meat.
Mothers told me that's not bringin' heat to the beat.
You told me to rap but now this shit's over.
I know I'm a kid but I'll spit when I'm older.
Some people hate and I acknowledge my weakness.
But I bring knowledge and confident speeches.
