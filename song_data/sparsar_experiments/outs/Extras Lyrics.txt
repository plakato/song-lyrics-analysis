Extras Lyrics
by Zubz.


We're tired of sitting in the background.
Like we don't matter.
Disappear into the background.
Like we don't matter.
Extras In the background.
Like we don't matter.
Disappear into the background.
Like we don't matter.

Life is a docu-drama. This the theme song.
We Play whenever we wanna get our silver screen on.
Unscripted dialogue, POV cameras.
Scorsese angle shots, DOP pans across.
The Faces of the 99% percenters that showed up.
Cussed-off gatvol had enuff bout to blow up.
Emotion like a geyser, building from inside em.
Bout to burst pipes pressure cooker like a cider.
Can shaken right to the core, they want more.
Hand make a tight fist and balled, the sign for.
Defiance anywhere your landin, on the planet.
You'll find us at the front chantin, our demands.
In comradery we here standin, hand in hand.
For the crest, coat of arms, standard, for the families.
Behind the obvious allegory of hollywood.
Lies a story of sheer glory and fortitude.

We're tired of sitting in the background.
Like we don't matter.
Disappear into the background.
Like we don't matter.
Extras In the background.
Like we don't matter.
Disappear into the background.
Like we don't matter.

Ring The alarm attention and listen.
It's people army like M1 and Stic-man.
Many have come from brethren to sistren.
Whole marathon we been run the distance.
So the resolve is never in question.
Peaceful protest avoid an inquest into.
Whether or not we're about what we're professing.
The repercussions of decisions that need addressing.
Swept under the rug for too long.
You can't muzzle us now we're too strong.
Night time gone welcome the new dawn.
No more pass and dribble it's route one.
Never gonn' back up unless and until.
We see the ball hit the back of the net.
Our will is like steel word to Cleo.
Till we master our destiny we ain't packin it up just yet.

We're tired of sitting in the background.
Like we don't matter.
Disappear into the background.
Like we don't matter.
Extras In the background.
Like we don't matter.
Disappear into the background.
Like we don't matter.
