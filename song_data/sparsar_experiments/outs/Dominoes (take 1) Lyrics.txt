Dominoes (take 1) Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

It's an idea, someday.
In my tears, my dreams.
Don't you want to see her proof?
Life that comes of no harm.
You and I, you and I and dominoes, the day goes by....

You and I in place.
Wasting time on dominoes.
A day so dark, so warm.
Life that comes of no harm.
You and I and dominoes, time goes by....

Fireworks and heat, someday.
Hold a shell, a stick or play.
Overheard a lark today.
Losing when my mind's astray.
Don't you want to know with your pretty hair.
Stretch out your hand, glad feel.
In an echo for your way.

It's an idea, someday.
In my tears, my dreams.
Don't you want to see her proof?
Life that comes of no harm.
You and I and dominoes, the day goes by.
And by, and by....
