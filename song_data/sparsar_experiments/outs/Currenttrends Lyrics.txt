Currenttrends Lyrics
by Blood Duster.

Keeping pace with current trends.
A sellouts whordom never ends.
Making sure I got cool clothes.
A major labels dirty ho's.
Manager tells me / keep my look updated.
The kid demographic / make sure that its catered.
Wearing the right stuff / stop swearing and shit.
Cos parents don't like that / they buy their kids shit.
