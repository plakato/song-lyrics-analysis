Integrity Lyrics
by 4th25.


I, don't think yall understand what this is. 
This is war 
And, whether we'll ever see 
Our loved ones again, 
 
And, it's a lot of yall out there. 
I could never forgive 
And. I could never understand 
Why yall fuckers did what yall did 
 
Probably say it was too much 
And with it. You couldn't live 
But. I can see thru the smoke 
That's. How I know you a bitch 
 
Should, have never let none of that 
Come from between your lips 
Cause out here, its not murder, 
Just our desire to live 
, 
But yall out here with a cape on 
Clueless as shit 
Say, you saw the whole thing 
And. He ain't have to do what he did: 
 
No. He ain't have to go and killem 
He coulda let'em live 
But. You must a forgot. How many people here 
Ed see you dead, 
 
And. I don't care if he was handcuffed, 
Than shot in his head 
All. I know is dead bodies, 
Can't fuck with me again: 
 
And sure we make bad calls 
But, we don't fold each others hands 
Not at war. 
Cause things gon happen that we'll never understand. 
 
Fuck. Is these people talking bout 
Soldiers catching charges now 
Sure? We make mistakes 
But every soldier heres a target now 
 
Questioning how we get down 
Stand em up. We lay em down 
All that you can see to do 
Ask a million questions. Now 
 
Why'd we shootem why'd, he die 
Only tried to take our lives. 
Fuck is we supposed to do 
Come to far to let him ride? 
 
Now, your trying to say we wrong. 
Everytime somebody dies 
I ain't trying to let him live. 
He'Ll only try a second time. 
 
Fuck is really goin on 
Which side. Is you for 
We? Already getting fucked 
And Yall, trying to fuck us some more 
 
Probably just to soft 
To, have ever deployed 
Cause yall, the last ones squeezing off 
When. We are payin em forward, 
 
Got too big a conscious, 
At war with no heart for it 
And. I feel for those soldiers 
That yall have deployed with 
 
Cause everytime we are poppin off, 
You got to be for it. 
We Can't afford to have a mofucker 
Writing, his own story, 
 
And. This is not about right, 
Its life and what we'll do for it? 
But some of yall take for granted 
The best option for you, 
 
Sure its rules of engagement, 
But, they ain't lookin out for you, 
They'll see you dead, for you can see death 
Walking up towards you, 
 
So. At times, under the pressure 
We push the limit. 
So next time we see our family 
Is, not a funeral visit. 
 
But yall ed, probably see everything 
Just a little bit different 
That's. Why yall handin out charges 
And, we already been sentenced. 
 
The bottom line is 
Everybody, can't live 
Its, not too many fucks left 
So. We choose the ones we give 
 
And. There are none left out here. 
We have no more feelin 
Specially for a country, 
That smiles the whole time they trying to kill me .
 
But, let yall tell it 
Ain't nobody here guilty: 
You, feelin, sorry for the same fucker 
That ed make you his victim. 
 
Letm live after they shot at you, 
Me I'ma, killem 
Im, only trying to make it home 
But, yall, ed paint me the villan 
 
And. No, its, never that simple, 
We are forced to respond. 
While yall, pretend to yourselves 
It ain't shit, goin on 
, 
How, many soldiers, yall ed, see dead, 
For yall sing the same song 
Me. I took the gloves off 
Soon, as I saw one 
 
Cause. I fuckin with these people 
Its too much on the line. 
But. You must be confused, 
Please open your eyes, 
 
See it for what its worth 
Read inbetween the lines 
In this country. We are no more than 
Sheep amongst lions, so we ride
