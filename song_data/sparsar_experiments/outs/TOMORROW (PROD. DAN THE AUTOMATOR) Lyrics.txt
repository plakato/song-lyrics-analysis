TOMORROW (PROD. DAN THE AUTOMATOR) Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.

Sick and tired of this mess.
Smoke some weed relieve some stress.
Fess up to the crime.
Skippin states not doin time.
Don't whine i'm fine.
No bonnie just clyde.
Know just where to hide.
Take the plates off the ride.
We're all gonna die.
So why cry.
Nothin left to lose.
Aimin for the evenin news.
Darker than the blues.
Hey you.
Cmere.
Dont fear.
Just me here.
In my head.
Born dead.
Fuck em.
Crazy white boy on the set.
Never gonna find ya body.
Bet.
On this flow.
Here i go.
Shovel slice ya throat.
Blow some smoke.
Holy ghost.
Fuck that.
Poltergeist.
Think twice.
Fore you roll the dice.
Get iced quick.
Shawty still wants the dick.
But i'm tired.
Expired.
Spent.
Confession booth won't let me repent.
Cover the whole church in fuckin cement.
Hope god's content now.
Stompin off stage.
Fuck a bow.
Whoa.
Did you see that bro.
Fuckin homo.
Startin to look like frodo.
But i'unno tho.
Jump thru the air.
Slo mo.
Shave a mohawk in my hair.
Concrete jungle creepin.
Tall grass.
Hunters on my ass.
Pass the tree.
Never findin me.
Rambo, yo.
Wearin skin like my own.
Scalpin cornrows.
Ears teeth and necklace nose.
Bowie.
Knife.
Strife in this life of mine.
Time on rewind.
Tickin.
Shootin till its clickin.
No missin.
Rest in pieces.
Hear my thesis.
Statement.
I'm the shit cause i paint brains.
Mad deranged.
Wait for the beat ta change.
It goes on and on.

Dropped outtta honors class.
Teacher didn't have an ass.
Its cool i got some brass.
Break the glass case.
Wakin up wit pussy on my face.
Tha fuck happened.
Eyes blackened.
Maverick fashioned.
Towards the door.
Always ready for war.
Get the fuck out.
