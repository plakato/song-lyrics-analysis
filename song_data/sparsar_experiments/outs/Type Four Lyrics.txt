Type Four Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Drop down to my knees and ask you.
If you'd help me achieve this thing.
Then I'd be okay for several days.
But give it a week, I'm aching.
Got a number of new solicitations.
I would like to hang on you.
Cause I get spells.

It's type four.
Pretty rare.
You probably have never even heard of it.
What the fuck is wrong with you.
Leave it on.
Better not catch you lying down.

What do you do when you can't count to two.
And there are two types of people in this world.
Ones who can and ones who can't.
I know it's good for something.
I know it's good for me.
But I don't care.
I don't care, I don't care.

It's type four.
Pretty rare.
You probably have never even heard of it.
What the fuck is wrong with you.
Leave it on.
Better not catch you lying.
