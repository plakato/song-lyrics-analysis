Cross Of Hatred Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

See the fire, feel the pain.
The blood runs cold through our veins.
No mercy will reflect in our eyes.
United with the cold steel of death in our hands.
Let them pay for the crimes, they have done.
Crush their cities, burn down their lodgings.
Allow no one to survive.
Or their revenge will eradicate.
Your childrens lives.
Be prepared for the moment.
When you'll meet your maker.
And his reaper has become your own life taker.
Oh, here I stand and I swear, it's your word that I bear.
And I'll scream it out for everyone to hear.
I will fight not asking why, I will rub out every lie.
For your law, oh my Lord, I'm prepared to die.
See an arm, see a leg.
Torn apart the rest.
That's been you my friend.
Just seconds ago.
How many tears are left to cry.
How many lifes are left to die.
Who'll answer me now after you've closed your eyes?
Oh here I stand and I swear, I'll damn your word I still hear.
And I'll scream it out for everyone to hear.
I will not fight four your lie, why you want us all to die?
For your law, oh you beast, we've been sacrified.
