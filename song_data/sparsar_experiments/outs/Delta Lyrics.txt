Delta Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Highways were built to fold.
Keeping us tied to the great unknown.

Lose your legs and stow away with me.
It's elementary.

Find the stars, the fires, and the sea.
There's so much left to believe.

Keeping us tied to the great unknown.

Sellers on the streets passing dimes.
In and out cause we don't care.
Riding high on the PCH.
PCP in our blood and the wind in our hair.

Fix the 5 and move to Pismo Beach.
Where there's a plan, there's money.
Ride the 1 like the Pebbles upon the breeze.
You've got to end somewhere.

Lead me to the sea cause I'm feeling less than zero.
The rules of attraction I'll follow where you go.

Your pawning me out tonight, you're pawning me out tonight.
Take me home.

I'll follow where you go.
