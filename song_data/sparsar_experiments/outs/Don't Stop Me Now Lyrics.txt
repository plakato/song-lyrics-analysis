Don't Stop Me Now Lyrics
by Queen.


Tonight I'm going to have myself a real good time.
I feel alive.
And the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah.
And floating around in ecstasy.
So don't stop me now.
Don't stop me.
Cause I'm having a good time.
Having a good time.

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky.
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity.
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva.
I'm going to go go go.
There's no stopping me.

I'm burning through the sky yeah.
Two hundred degrees.
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.
I'm traveling at the speed of light.
I want to make a supersonic man out of you.

Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time.
I'm having a ball.
Don't stop me now.
If you want to have a good time just give me a call.
Don't stop me now.
Don't stop me now.
I don't want to stop at all.

Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars.
On a collision course.
I am a satellite I'm out of control.
I am a sex machine ready to reloadl.
Like an atom bomb about to.
Oh oh oh oh oh explode.

I'm burning through the sky yeah.
Two hundred degrees.
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.
I'm traveling at the speed of light.
I want to make a supersonic man out of you.

Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time.
I'm having a ball.
Don't stop me now.
If you want to have a good time just give me a call.
Don't stop me now.
Don't stop me now.
I don't want to stop at all.
Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time.
I'm having a ball.
Don't stop me now.
If you want to have a good time just give me a call.
Don't stop me now.
Don't stop me now.
I don't want to stop at all.
