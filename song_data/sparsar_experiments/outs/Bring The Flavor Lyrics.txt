Bring The Flavor Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.

Who brings the flavor 
That's me? That'S me, 
Who brings the flavor 
That's me.. I got it 
 
Oh! No, it's a scandal. 
I drop upon the mic like an anvil, 
And they'll praise me 
For mad thoughts, I'm crazy, 
I'm, searchin' 
Lookin' for the target. 
You, don't know what hard is 
This ain't all this hard yet 
But, I don't wan na be hard 
I, just wan na flow 
Cause rhymin' is my game 
And. I play it like a pro 
So. What 
You want to know my name? 
Dana Elaine 
All hail the queen acclaimed 
Drive, you insane 
Woman with a brain 
I'm, a Flavor Unit, MC 
And. That means I'm one of the roughest 
Def-est toughest best-est 
Wickedest MCs rappers in the place 
But. If you try, get swift, 
I'mma punch, you in your face, 
I'm a higher flier 
Why, you wan na cry, 
I'm already hot! So put me in the fire. 
Give me a pen and pad, and it's over 
Bye-ya 
See ya. Later alligator 
Hey D bring the flavor 
 
Bring the flavor La bring the flavor, bring the flavor La bring the flavor
 
I get down with the F.U. crew. The only way to be the only thing to do: ooh, 
, 
Yup, yup, yup 
I, be Latifah on the mic and 
When I'm rhymin'. Don'T you call my bluff 
Because? I hate it when I have to get dangerous, 
It divides it loosens and it weakens, and it changes us 
You, want more Sure. 
I fill you up like Texaco. 
I switch to Spanish 
And rock it from here to Mexico. 
Record go yo 
Watch. The pro 
Let me flow 
I'm raking in the dough on the down low 
So me no know 
Don't get me. Riled 
I get wick-wick-wild 
Flex styles by the pile 
So smile for awhile 
Aware, my dearâ€” 
 
That, the flavor's in the air 
Oh yeah 
, 
The flavor's. In the air, the flavor's in the air 
Bring the flavor La bring the flavor 
I get down with the F.U. crew. The only way to be the only thing to do: ooh 
 
Peep me cause I'm not sneaky or freaky on the mic. 
I just grab it grip, it rip it right. 
And, the girls know it 
And. The guys know it. 
I'Ll put your best to a test. 
 Wan na bet you'll blow it 
I'll smoke. You like a cigarette 
Just. Give me the mic. 
I'Ll give you wreck. 
And save your idle threats for the next rap 
I'll. Take it without the cream 
So leave it black 
But. You can leave the sugar 
So. I can make green-like-a-booger money 
In. The bank 
No need for actin' stank 
It's a sad thing to watch. You get gassed like a tank, 
And spank 
Look at the intelligent female I N, I 
Don't, try it 
You know I don't buy it 
Now uh. If your get-up-and-go 
Done got up and gone 
I wrote this song 
So, you can rock the hip-hop all night long 
So. I want a gigawatt in the back of your Jeep 
So. I can blast the shoes off your crusty feet. 
 
It's like this. It'S like this. It'S like this. It'S like this 
I get down with the F.U. crew. The only way to be the only thing to do: ooh, 
 
Bring, the flavor La bring the flavor
