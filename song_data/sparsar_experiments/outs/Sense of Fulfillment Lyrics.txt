Sense of Fulfillment Lyrics
by Uno Hype.

Yeah.
Yeah, tell yall some shit yeah.
I would like to welcome you to the future.
The ball wasn't in my court I still remain the shooter.
They don't give me eye contact like medusa.
Might turn me into stone my hoop dreams failed.
So I must be prone to the world of the unknown.
After school you gotta make it on your own.
Pockets on empty I'm takin a loan.
Homie I'm struggling I'm make it known.
Then they called up my phone.
I can't go back home I'm too damn grown.
But I'm only 17 and I hold my own.
Cuz my plans was bout to excel.
I'm in hell so I inhale with exhale.
Now I'm on the cover of XL.
Way past you homie I excel my life I'm never rushin.
I do it for my fam RIP to my nigga Justin.
Work my whole life I don't do this shit for nothing.
So many told me I wasn't.
So many broads blushin but I would never cuff em.
This hip hop shit been lovin.
So how you gon feel like that I write real rap.
And I will bite back Mike Vick in the field like that.
I'm on a mission to save the world.
Better save yourself homie before you save that girl.
I was weekend but it wasn't reaching.
Now they talking cuz I'm at my peak everybody want a feature.
Them doubters turned to believers a bucket turned to a beamer.
Overachiever 'mongst these new school leaders.
I didn't listen to teachers got a chick with class.
We on top of the bleachers money hoes and clothes.
That's all a nigga know if so we gone start a wardrobe.
Them dudes politickin so me I just blow.
Let a nigga float get higher than what they hope.
I was played for a joke told myself nope.
I would never be that told them niggas get back.
Or at least duck down I don't buss rounds.
And don't make sound to any one of them clowns.
Is the bud broken down I live my life fast.
I don't worry bout it now the plan was.
To make the people proud and stand out in the crowd.
And only bein honest who worked the hardest out the rest.
They ain't fuckin wit a nigga who on top keep em in check.
Yeah.
