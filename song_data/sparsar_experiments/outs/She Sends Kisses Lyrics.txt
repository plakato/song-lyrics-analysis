She Sends Kisses Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Ten tons against me and you've gone.
I put your favorite records on.
And sit around.
It spins around.
And you're around again.

Struck dumb while drugs run at how-high reeds.
Cue every memory at half-speeds.

Just like Charles, hold-me-downs, I'm coming sounds.
Cut crap, who's filling shoes like these anymore?

Past clumsy crushes beneath Thrill Pier.
Hopes pinned to poses honed in men's room mirrors.

A sophmore at Brown.
She worked Lost &amp; Found.
I put your face on her all year.

Five rows of photos when you wrote.
Of posed you, dressed blue, a backyard boat.

Signed at the bottom with this quote:.
Number four North Shore, A cape may address.
Your new one I guess All's well in hell and here's hoping'.

She sends kisses.
Some signed with Love, Beth O and X's.
She sends kisses.
Our oldest joke.
Some signed three 6's.

Our shore town knockdown sure was fun.
Yeah, white trash, what have you.
I fired replies back gun by gun.
Past seven wrecks I read four answers: Your move.
I'm tres involved, move on, love beth.

I walk it down.
This tourist town.
'Just thought I'd call 'just friends'.

She Sends kisses.
And all at once back doors blow open.
She sends kisses.
In envelveopes stamped w/ 'Hope and Hearts' - ripped right open.
She sends kisses.
But i'm corrupt - I wrote back 'good luck.'.
