Perusha KyÅ«den (Persian Palace) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Sesh.
Hunnid one virgins, all my rugs Persian.
Backwood burnin', I'm coming down swervin'.
Power stay surging, feel it in my blade.
Hands never shaking when I'm taking lives away.
I'm never gonna spray, I'm never gonna pray.
I'm never gonna ask God Why the fuck me?
I wasn't raised right, I did a lot of wrong.
Cops calling home, check my room, and I'm gone.
Young king Bones, hopping off the throne.
Kissing bitch's babies on their heads like a pope.
I give these crackers hope, I feed my bitches dope.
All my girls hate me cuz I never call home.
But when I do, I'm back in the tomb.
Mummified bitches from the floor to the roof.

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
I told my bitch to go and hit the store.
Just for me, and don't you dare bring a swisher home.
Fuck with me, I'm smoking backwoods all week and everyday.
And I never let a damn fool get in my way.
Only question now, is what's the pay?
Fuck you mean, I be hustling all day.
For the green, anyway, I get it anyway.
And anyway, you got a problem? Come see me today.
Bitch, uhh.
