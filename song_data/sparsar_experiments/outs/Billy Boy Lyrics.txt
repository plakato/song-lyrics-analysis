Billy Boy Lyrics
by Rusty.

Something deep inside of me.
That when it comes it won't bring too much prolong.
I don't know how hard it'll be when I suffer.
Affection is a start for me, I hope it's gonna move on.
This time it's gonna be hard for me, I don't wanna suffer.

I fight it hard when it tears my heart.
Oh when I want someone I gotta have someone.
And when I come to the conclusion.
So scared I don't want to fall.

Please don't make me suffer.
Please don't make me suffer.

Did he break his broken heart for you.
Oh no mother, he never loved a single other person.
This time it's gonna be hard for me, I don't want to suffer.

I fight it hard when it tears my heart.
Oh when I want someone I gotta have someone.
And when I come to the conclusion.
So scared I don't want to fall.

Please don't make me suffer.
Please don't make me suffer.
I'm not hard enough, I'm not strong enough.
Don't make me suffer.
