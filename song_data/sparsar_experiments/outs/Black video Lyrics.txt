Black video Lyrics
by S-X.

There is a space in time.
Sure there is a space today.
This wave that once shined.
On the beaches of my mind.
Ace it.
Start with the reign.
Black Video.

There is a beat that rhymes.
With sleigh bells and chimes.
This place is allright.
This place is allright.
Ace it.
Start with the reign.
Black Video.
