No Computer Lyrics
by Tyler Gary.


Uh, back to the basics, realities no Matrix.
So wake the fuck up kids before you miss your breakfast.
Late last night me and jack had a fight.
He knocked my ass out mixed 'em up with purple sprite.
Gulp gulp no pulp in my oj please.
College taught me why these older bitches always sneeze.
Go to bathrooms by the 2.
Powder me I'll powder you.
Now she's got a leaky nose.

2 hyper white bitches.
I ain't talkin bout the skin tone.
Been gone, sniffing sin salt through a thin straw.
Withdraws make her clench jaw now she pissed off....
she just trynna get a fix dog.
You could tell by the look in her eyes.
She loved to be at fancy restaurants.
But the food was despised.
In all honesty, I believed her truth was a lie.
Found a substance that could make her think she's living the life.
Fuck, when your beauty's gone you'll turn to a trife.
And I'm not trynna be malicious.
I'm just quoting real life, alright?
And thats the story of a basic chick.
If you're headed down that path, I suggest you flip a bitch.

And then you quickly turn into the enemy.
When I speak your name I get an urge to gargle listerine.
I wish I could erase you from my history.
But I am no computer you have no clue what you do to me.

And then you quickly turned into the enemy.
When I think your name I need the strongest antihistamine.
I wish I could erase you from my memory.
But I am no computer you have no clue what you did to me.
