Hey Girl Lyrics
by Zooey Deschanel.

Don't let the sunshine fall from the sky;.
Just find the sunshine in your own eyes.
You're a lollipop, no second prize;.
An apple somewhere, in somebody's eyes.

Hey girl, whatcha' doing?
Hey girl, where you going?
Shot in the arm, a twinkly eye.
She could have fell, fell out of the sky;.
She could have fell right out of the sky.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?

Don't let the moonshine cry up the night.
Step from your shadow, and make it bright.
You're a lollipop, no second prize;.
An apple somewhere, in somebody's eyes.

Hey girl, whatcha' doing?
Hey girl, where you going?
You get down, and make a frown;.
She'll come turn, turn, turn it around;.
She'll come turn, turn, turn it around.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?

Hey girl. Whatcha' doing?
Hey girl. Where you going?
You get down, and make a frown;.
She'll come turn, turn, turn it around;.
She'll come turn, turn, turn it around.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?

It's JESS !
