Cobwebs Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Somewhere impossible light still shines.
And every smile is if as new.
Sometimes I feel like the static in the attic.
Is making me....
Just confused.

If I fall will you catch me?
If I'm sorry, sorry enough.
If I fall will you pity me?
Will you confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Confuse my love for the cobwebs?

I always pause if I can on 5th avenue.
Look uptown with my head in the stars.
Somewhere the buildings give way to sunlight.
Give way to east and west Central Park.

If I fall will you catch me?
If I'm sorry, sorry enough.
If I fall will you pity me?
Will you confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Will you confuse my love for the cobwebs?
For the cobwebs?

Will you confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Confuse my love for the cobwebs?
Confuse my love for the cobwebs?
For the cobwebs?
For the cobwebs?
For the cobwebs?
For the cobwebs?
