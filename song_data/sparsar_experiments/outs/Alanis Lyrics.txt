Alanis Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Here comes the sun.
She's playing guitar.
And I wanted you to want me somehow.
So here comes the moon.
Soft silhouette.
And I wanted you to love me did you forget.
Go on and ask me to dance.
Go on and ask me to dance.
I just might I just might for you.
Alanis, rag doll marionette.
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, can you hear me?
Alanis, Alanis.
So here comes the part.
The part with the strings.
Broken hearts laid on old wooden machines.
So here comes your girl.
Pretty as fuck.

So go on and ask me to dance.
Go on and ask me to dance.
And I just might I just might for you.
Alanis rag doll marionette.
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, can you hear me?
Alanis, Alanis, Alanis.
