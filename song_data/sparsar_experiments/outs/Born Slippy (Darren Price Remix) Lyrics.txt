Born Slippy (Darren Price Remix) Lyrics
by Underworld.

Let your feelings slip boy.
But never your mask boy.
Random blond bio high density rhythm.
Blond boy, blond country blond high density.
You are my drug boy.
You're real boy.
Speak to me and boy dog.
Dirty numb crackin' boy.
You get wet boy.
Big big time boy.
Acid bear boy.
Babes and babes and babes and babes and babes.
And remembering nothin' boy.
You like my tin horn boy and get.
Wet like an angel.
Derail.
Drive boy, dog boy.
Dirty numb angel boy.
In the doorway boy.
She was a lipstick boy.
She was a beautiful boy.
And tears boy.
And all in your inner space boy.
You had.
Hand girls boy.
And steel boy.
You had chemicals boy.
I've grown so close to you.
Boy and you just groan boy.
She said.
Come over, come over.
She smiled at you boy.
Drive boy, dog boy.
Dirty numb angel boy.
In the doorway boy.
She was a lipstick boy.
She was a beautiful boy.
And tears boy.
And all in your inner space boy.
You had.
Hand girls boy.
And steel boy.
You had chemicals boy.
I've grown so close to you.
Boy and you just groan boy.
She said.
Come over, come over.
She smiled at you boy.
Drive boy, dog boy.
Dirty numb angel boy.
In the doorway boy.
She was a lipstick boy.
She was a beautiful boy.
And tears boy.
And all in your inner space boy.
You had.
Hand girls boy.
And steel boy.
You had chemicals boy.
I've grown so close to you.
Boy and you just groan boy.
She said.
Come over, come over.
She smiled at you boy.
