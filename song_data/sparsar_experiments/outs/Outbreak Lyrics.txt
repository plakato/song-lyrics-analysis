Outbreak Lyrics
by Zomboy.


Zomboy and Armanni Reign.
I'd like to welcome you to our program.
No more commercial interruptions.
We just say wsup and then go HAM.

Hit 'em with the slogan.
Then I open bottles for the models in the cut.
Tell them haters in the back what they lack is.
Never mind, I don't give a what.

I'm on my bullshit.
Loose cannon with a full clip.
Soon as we step on stage then we ragin.
Case you ain't really know the rules, bitch.

See them bodies moving you prolly losing yo damn mind.
Speakers bump when we grind, Get it?
I don't see nothing wrong with mine.

Damn.
No time for playing it cool.
I'm on my bullshit.
I feel like breaking some rules.
And I'm like.. Damn.
No time for playing it cool.
I'm on my bullshit.
I feel like acting the fool.

Let's git it then.

Instrumental.

Yo.

For those who don't get it, I'm sorry.
Not really, we still chillin and feelin like a couple bosses.
In the party there are no losses.
Think about what hangovers cost us.
Inhibitions lost in they offers.
It's just another day at the office.
Cause and effect when the hell the sun come up.
Ah fuck it that's awesome.

Club or the rave, misbehaving.
It's a safe haven for a misfit.
Whatever your situation.
No complications when bass hits.
It's back to the basics, hands in the air if ya here to get loose.
The beats too sick to have an excuse.
And not have outbreak God dammit that's truth.

I'm saying though.

Damn.
No time for playing it cool.
I'm on my bullshit.
I feel like breaking some rules.
And I'm like.. Damn.
No time for playing it cool.
I'm on my bullshit.
I feel like acting the fool.

Instrumental.
