Child Star Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

CHILD STAR.
Is there a photo of me on your wall.
In short short-shorts or zipped down jeans?
Do you look up at night and wish you were me, under the spotlight?
Are you visceral viscous?
Do you want to make love to my sweet visage?
And then pretend it's you, it's you, it was always you.

FAN.
I wrote you a letter to become a member of your fanclub.
But all i got in the mail was return to sender.

STAR: I'm still a big big star.
FAN: No, you're not.
STAR: Yes, I am.
FAN: No, you're not.
STAR: Yes, I am.
FAN: No, you're not.
STAR: You liked my latest film.
FAN: No, I didn't.
STAR: Yes, you did.
FAN: No, I didn't.
STAR: Yes, you did.
FAN: No, I didn't.

FAN: I'm not a fan of yours anymore.
STAR: Yes, you are.
FAN: No, I'm not.
STAR: Yes, you are.
FAN: No, I'm not.
STAR: Yes, you are.
FAN: But you broke my fragile heart.
STAR: No, I didn't.
FAN: Yes, you did.
STAR: No, I didn't.
FAN: Yes, you did.
STAR: No, I didn't.

FAN: I hate you.
STAR: I hate you too.
FAN: I hate you.
STAR: I hate you too.

FAN: I hate you.
STAR: I hate you.
