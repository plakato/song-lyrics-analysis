Forever Bound (Jorgen Odegard Remix) Lyrics
by Von Grey.


Beautiful, God, your lips were holy.
But you were always lonely.
Still.
So much pain it, wasn't graceful.
Life can be distasteful.
Towards you.

I wanna lay my body down.
Sink into your ground.
Twist my lips upon your brow.
I wanna lay my body down.
I can't go without.
Cause I'm forever bound.

Instrumental interlude.
Bring it back.
Hit it.
Woo.

Hide you, guard yourself in moonlight.
Raptured by the dark night's.
Farewell.
You let go, I know that you surrendered.
Because you couldn't conquer.
Your fears.

I wanna lay my body down.
Sink into your ground.
Twist my lips upon your brow.
I wanna lay my body down.
I can't go without.
Cause I'm forever bound.

I wanna lay my body down.
I wanna lay my body down.
