Tetris Lyrics
by Punsy.


Our game has just begun., We'll start at syllable, one
It's simple, but it's fun. I'll, add another here. It comes
A great emcee. You knew this.. I make amazing. Music
My flow is slick as fluid. Man. This track too sick
Don't. You know I'm monstrous i'll. Take a beat and stomp on it
And all you'll do is honor it. I'M making tracks atomic hits
Every bar's beyond creative, intricate and complicated
You can't say it's not. Amazing should be grammy nominated
I'm coming to war with missiles, muskets and torches
You'll be rushing to forfeit. When I crush in your door hinge
Try to challenge me lyrically on my rapping efficiency
You'll have battling injuries. That will last for a century
Pure destruction from this pen. you'll get crushed in a instant
Crews that come will get dismissed, you're all nothing but dimwits
Got a drive like 60 civics Modified with hemi engines
Awesome guy, that's really gifted jotting lines. That'S clearly different

You're the kind of rapper that i'd never become
I'd, rather be good, emcee, cuz, there's technically none

Since. All the legends are gone. I expect to be one
I know that I am sick with this ability at spitting. Scripts
I'M, not a common lyricist. I do this cause. This is my gift
The bars. I spit are infinite. The schemes I fix are intricate
I'm killing every instrument, I'm known to be magnificent
I, feel that your style's irrelevent, I'm taking em out their element
I'm big. When you look at the scale of it, I'm who you'll never forget like an
elephant
I'm everywhere, like the internet., I'm killing the mic and i'll get respect

intersect
Killin my enemies finish: em lyrically, ending em instantly deader than
kennedy
Less than a minute see hell to the industry. There is no sympathy
Grabbin. The beats and i'll smash em to pieces laugh at your weakness. You'Re
Half way to decent
You have to believe that I'm actually genius surpassing emcees with
illmaculate speeches
Sit back, say: JESUS ...,
