The Manual for you All Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


This be ill, you don't know how sour the milk be/ 
It time for me to write some lines that just filthy/ 
Use poetic devices, like
onomatopoeia/ 
All y'all little kids, saying â€˜I got ta got ta pee, ma !'/ 
Then drop intellectual reference on me, mind/ 
This talking The Shock Doctrine like Naomi Klein/ 
Then be dropping classic lines. That'S legendary, Hiphop/ 
You can get with this or you can get with that. / 
Then make'em laugh and show-off. Some street cred hardcore/ 
I beat up my imaginary friends for more/ 
Then. I will give a personal experience. Lesson/ 
Alcohol and drugs. I stay clear of it when I'm stressing/ 
You wan na write good lines, don't type or touch a spliff/ 
Just follow my lead and please do it. Just like this/ 
The fire in my bones will not be quenched you so stupid/ 
So you, King of the Dot uh 
Time for French Revolution/ 
 
This is the writing. The pen and the paper/ 
This is the fighting Godsend and a favour/ 
Stop with the biting. When it's a lot, safer/ 
To follow the manual for you, all/ 
, 
Then drop names of people, you think are the nicest/ 
I went to the Drake Hotel. I met D-Sisive/ 
I got a Children's book called The Beautiful Oops/ 
Warmed, my soul, like a bowl of Chicken Noodle soup/ 
It, taught me to learn from my mistakes. Failures and errors/ 
But to have learn from someone's else's is even rarer/ 
But. You got ta get your own voice. King George, the Sixth/ 
And just know you closest friends. Are your therapist/ 
You'll, no longer stutter when you utter get really pissed/ 
Get on the radio declare war on this silly shit/ 
What you wan na. Do I'm going crazy, like Daffy duck/ 
I'm, going crazy like Muammar Gaddafi, better duck/, 
Internet, cowardly critics, I've had enough of you/ 
I'm a student, so I don't listen to the substitute/ 
So trace the trail. And
Never get cheesy and stale/ 
Like. Two week old KD in the
garbage pale Fail, /, 
,
