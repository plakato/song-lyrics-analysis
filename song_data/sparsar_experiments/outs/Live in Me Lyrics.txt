Live in Me Lyrics
by Rufus.


There's a feeling I just can't deny, it's fire straight from my soul.
And it's hot enough to tear you up, make you lose control.
Gonna soothe you, put you in a trance and get your senses aroused.
So there ain't no use in holdin' back, gotta let that feelin' out.

Refrain.
Live in me, come in my life.
Fill me with all that sweet delight.
I'm burnin' up, steamin' inside.
So give me the love I need tonight.

Foolin' 'round, you got no time to waste, so baby turn out the light.
And let's get down to what to takes to keep me satisfied.
Don't give me dreams, I don't want to know cause I need something to hold.
And action speaks more tenderness than words could ever show so.

Refrain.

Groove with the motion, let's take it to the top.
Ride with the feeling, there's no way I'm gonna stop.
I'll give you heaven to help you through the day.
And super lovin' takes your breath away.

Refrain.
