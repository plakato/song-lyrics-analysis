Hardcore (Yeah) Lyrics
by Viva Fidel.

Gigalo JG 
Gigalo JG, I got ta, get it in 
Branded by the OGs, my fraternity in the wind 
And. I ain't got ta, try to live out. My raps, nothing fabricated, 
Inner city, raised. I get around the map. 
The game came in one ear. I let it settle in 
And now, embedded in my skin, with the melanin 
Great lake game spitta, aiming for the top pillar, 
My mental hot double barrel, with the crabs in'em 
Doin, my damn thang did'nt. Do the dope mane 
Drove down the driveway, got double on the dope game, 
Thats how you living when decisions? Have you moving fast 
And? I decided on this here grind and countin' cash. 
But ain't knockin', like I heard hustle with a plan 
And, be prepared cause every plan run into a jam. 
And every friend ain't, a friend when he facin' 10 
And hoes disappear when ya running low on ends. 
 
Vivafidel 
Wake up wake up to win, put myself in a better place. 
No short cuts got ta, keep a steady pace, 
Breathe Deep! Don'T blink can't think about sleep. 
Stay focused on the finish line. 
I know I'm gettin' mine 
Destined for greatness, no matter how much they hate this 
Read the signs you can have heaven or hell 
Will this currency collapse, 
Whats gone happen in 2012. 
Time will tell, or Fidel will reveal 
I can barley pay attention trying to pay all these bills. 
Listen niggas keep it real, but its really all relative 
And, its all related replayed and relived 
You, get what you give, but don't fuck up the rotation. 
Thats, the universal law, 

Let ya thoughts flow, let ya self go 
Uplift. The ghetto from the boombox perspective 
The world was watching when we was poppin
