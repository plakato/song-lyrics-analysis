Foulbrood Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Saw them taking down the license.
With firecracker casings all.
Strewn about the street behind it.
Too much fun to make the call.

I got a bad idea.
I'm trying to ignore.
But with every comb that comes along.
There's a sting for every pore.
Foulbrood drank 'em up.

Bad mood, maybe vertigo.
Is the fear that you're going to jump.
And it might not be so bad.

Lost the second he stepped outside.
To commit suicide by cop.
Cat calling the coroner to ask him.
If he would pick him up.

I got a bad idea.
I'm trying to ignore.
But with every comb that comes along.
There's a sting for every pore.
Foulbrood drank 'em up.
Bad mood, maybe vertigo.
Is the fear that you're going to jump.
And it might not be so bad.
