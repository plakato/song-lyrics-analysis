Bad to the Bone Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Fifty years ago, with the world at war, 
Hands bloodied devastated, 
Better believe they're back for more 
Pounding the world. With a fist of steel, 
Jack booted heavy handed 
Careless of the pain we feel 
 
Bastards, throwing life away 
Killers alive today, 
 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Don't, tell no lies 
I, see through your eyes, 
You're bad to the bone. 
Oh! Oh, oh, oh 
Don't, tell no lies. 
You can't hear the cries. 
'Cos you're bad to the bone. 
 
Times have changed, but he don't know 
Zoot suit. Black tie 
Careless that the lies are low, 
One for all and all for one 
Talking, smooth hidden truth. 
Time bomb ticking just begun, 
 
Standing alone for the world to see 
Non-starter push harder. 
He still believes his time will come, 
Small, wonder old, thunder 
Can't. He see that he's wrong
