Do You Ever ? Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

No I don't believe in love anymore.
I know now it ain't real.
Cause Ive heard people say no matter what true love concurs all.

And it hurt so bad.

Im here alone.
No I don't believe in love anymore.
You said you'd always be here And now you're gone away.
And I can't heal this pain in my heart.

And it hurt so bad.

I need to know.
Do you ever think of me, ever think of me, ever since we said its over?
Are you ever missing me, ever missing me?
Baby did you even love me?

Don't even know why I wait up anymore.
There's no one coming back here.
I miss you more each day and I can't even give you a call.

And it hurt so bad.

Where did we go.
I don't pray of waking up anymore.
But in the life that I live I wish my dreams would stay It's the only world.
where I'm in your heart.

And it hurt so bad.

I need to know.
Do you ever think of me, ever think of me, ever since we said its over ?
Are you ever missing me, ever missing me?
Baby did you even love me?

Do you ever wonder what we could have been?
I thought the love would last forever.
You turned into my best friend.
No one living knows me better.
There's nothing I can do but try to make it through.

So baby could you please let me know.
Do you ever think of me, ever think of me, ever since we said its over ?
Are you ever missing me, ever missing me?
Baby did you even love me?

Do you ever think of me, ever think of me, ever since we said its over ?
Are you ever missing me, ever missing me?
Baby did you even love me?

no I don't believe in love any more.
