Bit By Bit Lyrics
by Akala.


No more bluffing it's, I'm a feel it in my belly button.
I'm a gluttin for your blushing your sweet little nothing.
Your discussion and your fussing and your face when your cussing.
Even when your wrong and no one can tell you nothing.
I'm addressing to the fact that, I can put my trust in.
Man sexy but it's more than disgusting.
My rushing, my gushing and when we push each others buttons.
Love you, so what's love time even when we Fucking.
Glutting for your stuffing n I want another clubbing.
Feenin' for your loving your hugging and back rubbing.
But, every so often I feel like I'm stuck in.
We don't give each other space, push each others buttons.
One can't speak shit without the other one buttin.
We talk a lot of shit but it don't mean nothing.
I say that I'm fucking but you no that I'm bluffing.
Listen for a minute baby let me tell you something.

Let's take it slowly... bit by bit.
Just get to no me... bit by bit.
I no we're not perfect but... bit by bit.
I no that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit.

Take it slowly... bit by bit.
Just get to no me... bit by bit.
I no we're not perfect but... bit by bit.
I no that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit.

Every time that we sinning I feel that I'm really winning.
When we finished and I'm grinning and I'm bringing another innings.
We just fulfilling the mission we're reliving.
I feel that I'm giving back myself that was missing.
I'm more like I'm drilling to myself that was hidden.
I'm a villain and I'm wicked but I'm also really timid.
I'm rigid and I pivot but I'm careful not to fidget.
Stick with it, I'm tryna get close to your spirit.
It's kinda like a riddle, I'll figure your just a little.
A wolves turned pit and throw me, in the middle.
The shirt comes down by your neck just a little.
It ain't even hot but u sweating just a little.
I feel like I might of found my wife just a little.
Kinda like I understand life just a little.
We can spend time, together, more than a little.
You wanna stay forever do my thing just a little.

Let's take it slowly... bit by bit.
Just get to no me... bit by bit.
I no we're not perfect but... bit by bit.
I no that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit.

Take it slowly... bit by bit.
Just get to no me... bit by bit.
I no we're not perfect but... bit by bit.
I no that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit.

Be my lady... bit by bit.
We can make babies... bit by bit.
Drive each other crazy... bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit.

Be my lady... bit by bit.
We can make babies... bit by bit.
Drive each other crazy... bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit.

Let's take it slowly... bit by bit.
Just get to no me... bit by bit.
I no we're not perfect but... bit by bit.
I no that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit.

Take it slowly... bit by bit.
Just get to no me... bit by bit.
I no we're not perfect but... bit by bit.
I no that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit.
