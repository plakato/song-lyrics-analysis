Leave Your Love Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.

Take all your feelings.
The way that you feel won't keep you warm.
Your pain and beliefs, stories and needs.
You got everything, all you ever wanted and more here.
Leave your love at the front door.
Leave your love at the door, leave your heart on the floor.

And if you leave your heart on the floor, leave your tears let em' pour.

Leave your love at the door, your love at the door.

Take all your mistakes.
Break all the promises you made girl.
Your secrets won't keep you safe.
Take your pride and your shame, your plans to escape.
Cause baby when i get down with it, you'll never ever be the same.

Leave your love at the front door.
Leave your love at the door, leave your heart on the floor.

And if you leave your heart on the floor, leave your tears let em' pour.

Leave your love at the door, your love at the door.
