Your Mirage Lyrics
by The World Alive.


You're the only one!
You're the only one!

Why can't this be what I want it to be?
Why can't I have the life I keep dreaming?
An empty bed with no one to share....
Moments too brief like you weren't even there!
Every second without you here.
I keep thinking, I'll wake up.
And you'll be there!

You're the only one I need.
Your body pressing against me.
I'll always be rushing home to see your face.
A never ending chase.

Refrain.
Keep asking questions, will there be answers?
Hidden mysteries, is this a love affair?

And you'll be there.
You know that I will be there.
For you, you know that I will be there.

When I'm gone, are you lying there?
Thinking about a life that we can't share.
Empty promises I give, another life.
This isn't it, this isn't it!
I won't let them destroy my dream.
I would give you my everything.
I can't let things just end this way.
You are my blessing, I am your curse.

You're the only one I need.
Your body pressing against me.
You're the only one I need one.
Your body pressing against me.
I'll always be rushing home to see your face.
A never ending chase.
