Collapsing Lyrics
by The World Alive.


Desires are dangerous things.
Bringing sorrow to many, men to their knees.
You've built your life to live with no regrets.
But the secret is none of us could ever really live.
So here you are at the end of the road.
Wondering which path to take, or if you'll ever know.
You'll live to sing again, you'll live to sing again.

Refrain.
You'll live to love again.
You'll live to love again.

Your world.
Your world is falling apart.
The darkness seizing your heart.
You keep falling further away.
These desperate feelings, you wish would go away.

There are times in this world, nothing makes sense but the dark.
Nothing makes sense but the dark you know too well.

And nothing matters when you can't feel anymore.
And nothings worth the fight when the fights all you do any more.

Refrain.

You keep falling and you're not sure where you'll will land.
These distant memories are all that you have.

Refrain.
