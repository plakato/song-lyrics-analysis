Your Favourite War Lyrics
by Wolverine.

There's a war inside you.
And I can't escape the ground.
I'm losing my lifeline.
Because you just can't face the truth.
Your face deceives me.
You tie me with your words.
Fall on your own stones.
But still it's my mistake.
Forgive me… Forgive me for your sins…
I want to ease your pain.
But you turn your head away.
I found you in your rain.
But you can't find me.
This stupid game we're playing.
You know we both will lose.
Locking all your doors.
No one gets in, no one gets out.
Please release the rope that holds me.
So I can reach your mind.
There's something holding me.
Oh, there's someone holding me.
Forgive me… Forgive me for your words…
I want to ease your pain.
But you turn your head away.
I found you in your rain.
But you can't find me.
I want to ease your pain.
But you turn your head away.
I found you in your rain.
But you can't find me.
I want to ease your pain…
I found you in your rain…
I want to ease your pain…
I found you in your rain.
But you can't find me…
