Where Them Hammers At Lyrics

40 Glocc 
Big Bash 
4-O, 
Sam Scarfo, 
Infa, infa, 
Infamous 
Up in this bitch 
Infa-infa 
Infamous 
Up in this 
 
I'm, the king of the coast, I'm a rider for real 
Dickies T-shirts. That'S my deal 
Keep. My peripheral in my rearview 
Step in the club 
And. Do that one-two 
Infamous G's 
Do what they want to 
Move in a unit 
Like we'posed to 
Watch ya, step 
Don't, get too close fools 
Matter of fact, 
It's past your curfew, 
You dealin', with grown men. These hands'll hurt you 
With crumbs off of my table, my homey'll murk you 
Your life was adopted. You could say I'll birth, you 
The nail in the coffin 
Straight to your torso 
BLIP-BLIP-BLOW 
Ain't you dead, yet 
I knew he had bitch in them. The day we first met, 
Pussy was bleeding. 
I gave him a cold test. 
Hit his ass up 
Nigga, this cold grip, 
I'm, already gone 
Over half a state, 
I created ya life 
And this. The thanks I get 
My chain and my neck represent the set 
Yellin' Guerilla Unit, cuz 
Beating my chest: 
Feelin', hella buzzed off of liquor and blunts 
Treating everyday, like the first of the month, 
With a pocket full of stones still served in a cup 
And a fitted. Twenty pack right hand on my gun: 
Uh 
, 
Sam Scarfo. You ain't really that deep, 
You ain't, bangin' no heat 
You, don't really want beef where them hammers at 
Both, BLAO, BLAO, BLAO, 
Sam Scarfo, Where them hammers at 
Both, BLAO, BLAO, BLAO, 
Sam Scarfo, Where them hammers at 
Calico, mack 10 A.K. everything, 
Shorty, whop, 40, Glocc 
Homey. What you got ta say: 
40 Glocc It's on nigga 
Sam Scarfo, Where them hammers at 
Both, BLAO, BLAO, BLAO, 
Sam Scarfo, Where them hammers at 
 
I, moved out the hood 
Straight to the'burbs 
Keep my ear to the street. Like I sleep on the curb 
Put my feet to your hair piece to get on your nerves, 
Drink, liquor, til, I'm pissy 
I must concur 
Dump til the clip empty watch. The outcome occur, 
Treating trouble like pussy divin in head. First, 
I fill that boy up from the head on down 
Turn a crooked-ass frown, 
Upside down 
Keep heat in my pants 
Like, a STD 
Ridin' shotgun in V.I.P. SUV, 
I'm, S-U-P, 
R-E-M-E, 
Do, a driveby in daylight like big Tray, Dee 
When, I yell out Peace 
I want A piece of the pie: 
Or, I'm a use, the doo-wap to knock a piece at ya: thigh 
It's hard to stay alive, niggas easy to die, 
Now analyze my life and try to walk in my nights, 
Let's see how many bullets you could die tonight. 
If. I die tonight, 
I'll be remembered, 
For them throw-away burners with no serial numbers, 
I'm a felon homeboy 
No registered pistols. 
If you running from me, homie 
That lead'll, get you
