Come Out & Play Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Twisted sister....
Come out and play....
Twisted sister....
Come out and play....
Twisted sister....
Come out and play....
Twisted sister....
Come out and play.
Are you afraid.
Of things that go bump in the night?
Behind closet doors.
Of things when you turn out the light.
Don't be afraid of the night.
There's a light in the dark burning bright.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid....
...of the light.
Come inside our world.
An oyster 'round a pearl.
You'll all be safe inside.
A perfect place to hide, you'll see.
Fun by decree.
Ride above the storm.
The average and the norm.
A new found ecstacy.
A wild fantasy come true.
This one's for you.
Oh, welcome to our show.
Oh, welcome to our life.
Just follow me and you'll set yourself free.
Now won't you come out and play.
Come out and play.
Come on out and play.
Come out and play.
Come on out and play.
Come out and play.
Come on out and play.
Come out and play.
Come on out and play.
Join our cavalcade.
Enter the world you made.
We're only here for you.
To do what you won't do, you know.
On with the show.
A place where fallacy.
Becomes reality.
We'll spin you head around.
We're programmed to astound, stand by.
Prepare to fly.
Oh, welcome to our show.
Oh, welcome to our life.
Just follow me and you'll think that you're free.
Now won't you come out and play.
Come out and play.
Come on out and play.
Come out and play.
Come on out and play.
Come out and play.
Come on out and play.
Come out and play.
Come on out and play.
Come out and play....
Come on out and play....
Come out and play....
Come on out and play....
Come out and play....
Come on out and play....
