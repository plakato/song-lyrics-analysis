Church Lyrics
by Antonym.

Church 
 
A woum of a woman 
The tomb of the goodmen 
Twisted. In the mind she says it hurts 
They, told her pimp to go ahead and bring that ass to church 
Bring that ass to church 
Told him to bring that ass to church, 
She, ain't sneeze. But God Bless Her 
She ain't even sneeze, but God Bless Her 
 
Disturbed pastor asked her for ass 
Refusal forgotten got out the glass with a flask of Vodka 
Straight up ordered from the doctor, 
From god holy water was never this sinful 
Flawed vicious circle looks like The devil is upon us 
Yeah. I need myself goddess Yeah. I made myself a promise. 
Always stay honest, beat the system til it vomits 
Don't be cocky stay modest, Especially once you make it 
Its mine for the taking. I got religious activists shaking 
Doing the Macarrena, like 1 Macca, 2 Macca Shumarrer on Mach 5 
If. I don't crash Imma fly wings, spread in the sky, 
Angels gon na cry manger empty like why 
Jesus walks til he die shout out a classic 
Ratchet hoes can't appreciate the fantastic 
Nope 
Nope 
Nobody feel it Don't no body feel it 

Interlude 
People with brains, screwed up With me, 
Generation trippin, more than tadpoles in the 60's 
Quickies about as average as average joes wearing Dickies 
Then generosity flees, when all they wanted was the sticky 
Kitchen fanatic pot heads want the sticky 
 
Protect yourself from your mind: 
Human beings,
