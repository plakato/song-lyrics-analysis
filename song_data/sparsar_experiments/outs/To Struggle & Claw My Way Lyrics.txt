To Struggle & Claw My Way Lyrics
by The World Alive.


I am not afraid of you.
This is your anthem to sing to.
I am not afraid of you..
Be who you are not what they told you.

Everybody wants to be on top.
Nobody wants to work for anything they've got.
Everybody says you are you're not.
I want you to fight until you're something their not.

Even if this ends today.
I'd be happy to walk away.
Every day I lived a dream.
I gave my life meaning.

And every day you sing along.
Is a day I know I belong.
To struggle and claw my way.
To find out who I'm not.
And every day you sing along.
Is a day I know I belong.
To struggle and claw my way.
To find out who I'm not.

If you want to be like me.
Look in the mirror and find what you see.
Anybody can live their dreams.
Be the next you, not me.

Instrumental.

Refrain.
And all they want to hear you say is I surrender.
And all I want to hear you say is:.

I am not afraid.
Not afraid.
I am not afraid.

I'll find my way.
