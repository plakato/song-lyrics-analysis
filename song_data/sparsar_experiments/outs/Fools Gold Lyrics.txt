Fools Gold Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

You got a wild child reputation.
I bought your lies but my heart's not breaking.
That ain't me baby.
That's not me.
I'm digging deeper and the sun ain't shining.
I just can't seem to find your silver lining.
I'll find you out baby.

I'll find.
Your love's like fool's gold.
One day I'm rich, the next I'm broke.
And you're gone, gone.
Your love's like fool's gold.
Fills my heart and takes my soul.
And you're gone, gone.

You best go running when you hear the sirens.
When they come, don't you crawl back crying.
You should've seen baby.
You should'a.

So long.
I'm gone.
I'm gone.
I'm gone.
