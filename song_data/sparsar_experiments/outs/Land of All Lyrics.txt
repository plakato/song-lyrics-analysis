Land of All Lyrics
by Woodkid.


I took a chance to build a world of mine.
A one-way ticket for another life.
On a petrol stained sailboat.
On a petrol stained sailboat.

I used to dream about the other side.
The sun rising on the skyline.
And a beautiful rainbow.
Such a beautiful rainbow.

I came to break the wall that rose around you.
To see the land of all.
I will fall for you.
I will fall for you.

I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold.

I miss the friends I had to leave behind.
My dad saying “I'm proud of you, son”.
It makes me want to go home.
Could I ever call this place home?

I came to break the wall that rose around you.
To see the land of all.
I will fall for you.
I will fall for you.

I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold.
I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold you son.
I'm proud of you, to hold.

I came to break the wall that rose around you.
To see the land of all.
I will fall for you.
I will fall for you.
