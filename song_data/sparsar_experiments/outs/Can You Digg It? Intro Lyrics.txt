Can You Digg It? Intro Lyrics
by Que.


Ok. Now, this is just the beginning of a motherfucking rap cause I kept my.
mouth closed for too long. Talk to 'em.

I done kept it real from the jump, nigga.
Took a lot of shit and kept my mouth closed.
Just know you're playing with the right one.
Fuck around and kill your whole household.
Ever since a nigga dropped out and slept on.
Old ass rappers like some dope that was stepped on.
Put a topic on the table, see who really merkin'.
And check these niggas pockets, see who really hurtin'.
Niggas love to flex, but be dumb as a bitch.
Put him on the spot and make him read, watch how he stutterin' shit.
Your favorite rapper talk that trap shit, but never speak numbers.
Now that's the shit that raise a red flag and make a nigga wonder.

Aye it's the sixth man, I feel like Manu Gin√≥bili.
I put a show on for the fans like I'm playing at the Garden.
Put two and two together, now you tell me who should be starting.
I'm not a rapper, I just took a break from hooping.
Right now, I'm getting paid to talk shit and fuck the groupies.
While them same hating niggas somewhere looking goofy.
Me while I'm busy getting rich and gaining weight.
Hundred dollar plates, eating for the times we never ate.
With some bitches on the way and umbrellas in my drink.
Getting ? and my hair ?, nigga.
