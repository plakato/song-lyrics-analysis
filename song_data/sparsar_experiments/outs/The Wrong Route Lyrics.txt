The Wrong Route Lyrics
by Unknown Prophets.

This is a story about Tommy and Elaine.

Just another case about the wrong path.
It's gonna get ya.

Tommy was a nobody.
Throughout his childhood years.
Scrubby clothes, parents ?, no friends amongst his peers.
Junior high arrived so depressed inside.
Late one evening he even tried to take his own life.
Yo his mom found a knife.
With his wrists sliced.
Laying on the floor of his room, no lights.
Doctors put him on some meds for his depression.
But mom prayed nightly asking' god to bless him.
Now a freshmen up in highscool no longer the fool.
Place to forget the past and start new.
He quickly made friends with this cat named Juan.
And Tommy skipping class, stealing cigs from his mom.
A couple years pass now he's a junior.
11th grade searching for quicker ways to get paid.
He soon got connected with this cat down in ?
Now he's got his girl signing for packages in the mail.
Went from ripped jeans to mad cream.
Traded all his nightmares for the pleasant dreams.
No longer the kid with no friends trying to blend.
That chapter in his life soon came to an end.
Now a rollie covers his scars sitting' on his wrist.
Rocking' the illest gear cellie sitting' on his hip.
Fly whips, fly chicks, collecting mad chips.
Jealous cats waiting for his time to slip.
One night Tommy's driving home from this party.
High off the weed yo drunk from bacardi.
Barely made it home his mom helped him in the house.
Walked up in the living room passed out on the couch.
Suddenly these cats kicked in his door.
Ran up in the house threw his mom to the floor.
Put the pistol to her head this is what he said.
Your money and your weed or the bitch is fucking dead!
Tommy tried to tell em Yo its at another spot.
Two seconds later all you heard was a shot.
They pistol whipped Tommy snatched him for his jewels.
Ran out the house off in his ride they cruised.
Tommy struggled to make it to his mom's side.
She lay in a pool of blood with no life.
He finally thought he was a man and had it made.
But was it really worth the price that Tommy paid.

Take a look around.
Get the big picture.
People steady scheming on ways to get richer.
Trying to live a lifestyle that doesn't even fit ya.
Watch out kid cause in the end its gonna get ya.

Elaine was a high school girl she had it made.
Never late to school with above average grades.
Her own condo on the outskirts of Blaine.
Car, cell phone all in her parents name.
Bills paid for by mom and pops.
Who had a nice little tight relationship with the cops.
Living above the law and on top of the world.
Moms honor roll daughter and daddy's little girl.
But all of a sudden her life took a strange swing.
Elaine wasn't interested in the same things.
She felt she was living too plain.
And that she didn't fit in so she started running with a gang.
Selling cocaine she really didn't need the extra money.
She did it for the respect and the fame.
Now lets not forget this is the girl from Blaine.
And if her parents ever found out no doubt they'd go insane.
Soon she slowly lost her grip.
Elaine started skipping classes and her grades started to slip.
And one night she came home with a busted lip.
She insisted it was nothing but both her parents flipped.
She said she got hit by a basketball in gym class.
But the truth was that her boyfriend had whooped her ass.
The next afternoon they got a letter in the mail from the school.
It said that she was breaking some rules.
There was unexcused absences, good grades dropped.
And that there was a couple incidents with the cops.
They couldn't believe what they just heard.
That schools got some nerve.
Claiming that there Elaine was in trouble that's absurd.
So right away they called their friends on the force to investigate.
But by that time it was already to late.
For what they saw on the TV would stop their blood in their veins.
Local girl found dead overdose on cocaine.
Her parents never knew such pain.
And from that moment on their lives would never be the same.
Her mom took it the hardest like she was to blame.
And a month later she put a bullet in her brain.
Its a shame cause two lives were lost in this mess.
Elaine got more than she bargained for I guess.
Yo there once was a girl named Elaine who had it all.
She was high for a second but took a fatal fall.

Take a look around.
Get the big picture.
People steady scheming on ways to get richer.
Trying to live a lifestyle that doesn't even fit ya.
Watch out kid cause in the end its gonna get ya.
