Fitzcarraldo (live) Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Here, back, down a long and straight track.
I have chose the long road -.
That leads me to god knows.
So I can't stop right now.

Even the good stars can fall from grace and falter.
Lose their faith and slide.
But I can't get an ocean that's deep enough for my day.

It's the first of the ascension.
It's a sad way we've flown after the storm.
And her last words were I was only thinking of you.
In my olden days I was a slave.

Well now it's time for to sound your voice.
And capture what you're after.
My ship was sold right up the river.
But I'm not going down here.
This journey isn't over.
It's a long way to the house of Fitzcarraldo.
And her last words were I'm always thinking of you.
In my olden days I was a saint.

Even the good stars can fall from grace and falter.
Like lapdogs that stride that mystery.
And her last words were I'll see you down in history.
It's the only way that we can go.
I shall eclipse you.

It's a long way to Fitzcarraldo.
And I don't want to pray for you.
In the name of something true.
