Interlude (No Tastebuds) Lyrics
by Zoo Babies.

Babbu aka No Tastebuds.
Yo, i spit these bars.
Rolling with my crew, we full of stars.

Swag so clean, check.
out the paint on the cars.
Yo i walk around, all these guys got scars.

Cause i pull my pistol out and i pistol-whip their face.

I make their whole family a disgrace.

So much, so that they can't even taste.

Cut their tongues off and now they got a whack face!
