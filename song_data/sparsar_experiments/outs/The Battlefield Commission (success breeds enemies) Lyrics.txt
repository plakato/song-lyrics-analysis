The Battlefield Commission (success breeds enemies) Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

If this is how you want it then I'm throwing down the gauntlet, just know that.
It gets cold and lonely here when you turn on your friends and you can quote.
me on this:.
We took a whole song to say.
That you mean nothing to us.
And most especially nothing to me.

We play this game with a little bit of heart.
And lord knows we never said die, not once, when.
Each and every night I'll put my life on the line.
And for no other reason than to feel what it's like to survive.

And everybody wants to see us fail, but I don't care I'm being honest.
Cause I heard lessons not learned in blood are soon forgotten and.
We're in for a turf war but I came prepared we're.
Dug in and fed up and we're not taking prisoners.

We play this game with a little bit of heart.
And lord knows we never said die, not once.
When each and every night I'll put my life on this line.
And for no other reason than to feel what it's like to survive.

We took a whole song to say.
That you mean nothing to us.
And most especially nothing to me.
It just makes this that much sweeter.
Cause I want you to feel defeated when this one comes around.
Damn right I'm calling you out:.
What would I be if I couldn't believe in something.
Like bricks or typewriter instincts.
We're sworn enemies, you're a dead man walking.
Know that I'll be hell if you come hunting but I'm tired of talking.
Cause our word is our bond, it's all we can say, I said I would bury you.
And I keep the promises that I make.
Cause we play this game with a little bit of heart and lord knows that we.
never said die.
Not once.
