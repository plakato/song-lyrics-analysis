All There Was Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.


Hey.
I am the one.
That's been keeping you alive.
Who am I to even change?
?

Sacrifice.
I give and I give and you take.
Paid the price.
Needless to say it was never enough.

Lift.
Lifting the bow.
Revealing the mask in disguise.
Forgive others that no one can see.
A comical tragedy.

With hope I'll find a way.
Beckons too late.
With nothing hope you can find a way.
Time will reveal what's left.
And who's dying alone.
