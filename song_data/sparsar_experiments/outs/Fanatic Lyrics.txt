Fanatic Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


When I wake up.
All I want is for him to take me away.
To that incredible comfort zone.
Inside that beautiful place.

When I need to release tension.
So that I can feel brand new.
And reach that height.
That only one in this whole world can take me to.

All the time I want you, baby.
All the time I need you, honey.
All the time I gotta have you, sugar.
Because I'm addicted.
Oh, yeah.

All the time I want you, baby.
All the time I need you, honey.
All the time I gotta have you, sugar.
It belongs to me.

I'm fanatically addicted, see.
The way that he be loving me.
It's like a drug.
Or some bad habit.
Since it's mine.
I got to have it.

Oh it feels like.
Like I've never had it right before this.
There was so much emotional pain.
Nothing positive to gain.

But I'm loved, full.
And completely now.
Not just a physical thang.
But it's something spiritual.

All the time I want you, baby.
All the time I need you, honey.
All the time I gotta have you, sugar.
Because I'm addicted.
Oh, yeah.

All the time I want you, baby.
All the time I need you, honey.
All the time I gotta have you, sugar.
It belongs to me.

I just gotta have it.
I'm a fanatic.
I just gotta have it.
I'm a fanatic.
I just gotta have it.
I'm a fanatic.
I just gotta have it.
I'm a fanatic.

All the time I want you, baby.
All the time I need you, honey.
All the time I gotta have you, sugar.
