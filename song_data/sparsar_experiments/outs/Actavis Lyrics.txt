Actavis Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Actavis prescriptions coppin' drank in different clinics.
Asking Dori why he sippin'.
Say it's helpful for my vision.
Always fucking older women.
Like my age is just past fifty.
Pressing tracks out with a spatula hoping that I can get it.

All I want is Actavis.
My bank is fab and shit.
I know she wanna fuck me see me asking where the mattress is.
Xanax makes my racks emit.
Sell a pack then crack ya shit.
Ya moneys low, ya shit's not dope ya really looking average kid.

All I want is Actavis.
All I want is Actavis.
All I want is Actavis.
You acting bitch I'll snap ya shit.

Actavis.
