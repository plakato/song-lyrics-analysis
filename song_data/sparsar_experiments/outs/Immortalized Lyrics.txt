Immortalized Lyrics
by 3X Krazy.

Phone conversation for 25 seconds, 
 
Bart 
We on a paper chase, 
I see it all through my third eye. 
You played it fast, so we push it worldwide. 
It'S juss a mental suicide, Kamakazie 
Got the plug on this game. So we on the plane, Friday, 
Finally its a motherfuckin hit 
Clicks fists of four-fifths, Steady Mobb in this bitch 
I see his eyes wide. His wig split up 
On some murderous. An half of his mutha 
Fuckin clan was on some other shit. Scramblin 
Them bullets through his skin tissue 
It's. America'S host 
You knew the game never fit. You 
It's. All official 
His last breath was on his line front 
Immortalized. His time has come. 
 
Immortalized 
Blood, shot red my eyes, 
When the gun shots spread the skies it ain't, no, where to hide 
I swear to God. A credit card can't account for the hate 
Boy. It'S too late, theres no escape we already plannin ya. Wake 
 
Keek Da Sneak 
Uh break me down. 
Roll me up an hit. It 
Don't shake me now 
Take another hit. I want you to feel it 
This. The realest 
This is what you'll be hearin through the backstreets starrin 
Hit. The baron 
But dont forget always check ya side views an ya, rear-end 
Niggas fearin for the fact that you havin paper an you, dealin 
Ridin fetti, an a couple of hatas gon catch you when you ain't, ready, 
Like Redman, take it from the back 
To the head From lettin it seen 
Casket bed me 
But. Instead, me I'mma live through it all 
I spit an fall. 
I'Ve been feelin like that. Since 2, Raw 
Like Above The Law, 
I was off that V-S 
Bitin titties through the bra 
An nigga, we juss 
Get a kick outta breakin. The law 
An then dig this 
Cuttie that be breakin me off 
An. I need this 
So, I'm tryin to snatch it all. 
Its scratch an fall 
I'd rather stay on top an ball 
So. My family is set when death calls 
 
Ridah of Mob Figaz 
Now what they thought. 
That I'd give up an get caught 
After I 
Grab the nine an headed straight for the vault 
When. There ain't. Never been a battle that I fought an lost 
Wit out my ... opponnent bein traced out in chalk 
But. I still ain't satisfied: 
So peep, the rapid-fire 
This'll be the day I die, fuck rappin I'll, retire. 
Negotiators said he'll provide the paper I desire. 
But he's a liar 
An, I'm tired of bein lied too 
So. We die too, when I ride through 
Bustin, in wit the hostages 
Killin me the guilt in me, fuck the cops, an shit 
Spectators see the caper holla. Stop this kid 
But its too late. 
I! Fear! No fate plus shootin straight 
An, its funny 
Cuz. All I ever wanted was some money 
An someone to suck me like they had no teeth. 
Now. All of a sudden. These motherfuckers wan na know me 
Call me down sayin Ridah. Let the hostages free 
But, I'm on some fuck the world shit an I don't know. 
I guess. I'M stressed off the bullshit 
 
Fed-X of the Mob Figaz 
I've done adapted to this environment 
Now. They can't stop me 
A Mob Figga, 
Military tactics menace to society. 
One of the chosen five 
That lead immortal lives, 
Snatchin' all the product 
Breakin' every bone in the closet, 
I'm out to get the data 
The top secret information got me, took 
I'm bendin' every law in the book. 
I fled the scene with two nines in the sky. 
Sereal number scraped with no trace 
And known to race; 
To, get this pace: 
Imported weapons, 
Army, fatigues and body vests 
I'm restin' for armageddon with the illuminati 
Tales of Demias Twentieth century raised right, 
It's third war 
Busted hinges and broken doors, 
Interrogation and infiltration on the five 
Immortalized 
, 
Nigga, 
 
You, know what I'm sayin 
We've known to hustle since the beginning of civilization. 
Until. This motherfucker 
You know what I'm sayin ... burn out. 
That'S all it's gon be 
We. Ain'T did nothin, but breed in this shit, 
You know what I'm sayin 
Young niggas .... You know what I'm sayin ... all of us 
You know what I'm sayin 
All of us, 
Get ya money watch them lights. 
Knock on you knock on me, 
Fuck it. You know what I'm sayin til it's over wit 
Thug it out til the end of civilization. 
You know what I'm sayin 
Against all odds. 
Until we die ride until we die 
Mobbin it out Money, Ova, Bitches, 
Money, ova all that shit 
First priority it's over. All of it

Go. Until this motherfucker burn out 
FUCK IT { *echoes, out*, },
