F64 Lyrics
by Yungen.

Yungen... SBTV... F64... listen.

I was blessed with a gift, and that's rapping.
To end this present I'm the best, no slacking.
I don't ever front what I say, bro I'm.
backing.
Tell them don't sleep on this hustle, I'm napping.
I get girls let me reflect.
Now I'm busting in this wave, I can see sex.
Where I'm from banging don't get you respect.
You don't understand the hood, you some.
V-necks.
I'm on fire let me melt this.
They don't see me no more, I'm on my stealth shit.
I think a label needs to help this.
I'm all about me, put me on the market I can sell.
fish.
Playing Cod, thinking what I got to brag.
about.
They on my nuts, I ain't even bought a banger.
out.
And I don't wanna see you man about.
It's man down man down if I ever bring Rihanna.
out.
I'm in the booth and I'm making those hits.
My brothers on the block, they be breaking those bits.
Any violation we be raising them sticks.
Got a couple G's fresh, they ain't taking no.
lip.
No diss, I'm in touch with the game.
I love music, I ain't tryna bust for a name.
I got a few fans, some beautiful people.
Some Chris Browning's wanna fuck me for the.
fame.
A word to my mother I'm the nicest.
Do it like a dude, this price tag is.
priceless.
Jetlag swag, I'm the flyest.
Freestyles are hard, I don't need to touch mic to show that I'm.
righteous.
They got my thinking 'bout cribs.
Drinking outta bottles, we ain't drinking outta.
lids.
I'm tryna give my family the best life.
So until I bust, I ain't tryna think about.
kids.
And these days they don't recognize talent.
I told 'em give me space cah I need time to plan.
it.
Lyrically out of this world, we don't.
balance.
Tell me how the fuck they've blown and I haven't.
But fuck that, ima blow with time.
I don't watch them niggers, do you clock that.
line.
The way I did it again, did you clock that.
line.
I never had a guilty man, they can't stop my grind.
So I was only 16 and had a big 9.
Throwing mood swings, how can I let shit slide.
From the playground, I had to climb out the frame.
I never been one of them kids to dick ride.
And am I really that good, that's the new riddle.
Them man try hard to spit, I just lose.
dribble.
Them man do a lot, so they don't say much.
Them man be talking to the pigs and they do.
little.
Speak to me with a nice tone.
Nick knack paddy whack, give a cat a light bone.
Head in my music, I ain't tryna fall off.
So if it gets peak, I got 3 G's that I phone.
Listen SBTV, my Mum got a blessing, I'm so.
blessed to be me.
You see me, I joined the new wave, I'm in depth cah I got a point to prove.
But I ain't tryna lift a gun, leave me alone I ain't tryna rip a lung.
I know burners, yeah the 4 5ths the 1,.
fuck a 9 to 5, I ain't a 4:51.
