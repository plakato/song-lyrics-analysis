Plenty Nonsense Lyrics
by YUNG ROC.

Yungroc Plenty Nonsense: 
 
Interlude, 
 
E get plenty plenty things, wey, no suppose to happen. For this life 
Plenty plenty things 
Plenty plenty nonsense: 
 
After the rains come the sunshine 
But we don't even feel'em again, not even the sunrise 
Awake to meet new black days everyday. Amidst pain and anguish, blood, stains
everyday, 
From bombings to mourning, 
The scores still running, 
We no longer live like we used to 
Cuz, we chose to kill our fellow brothers. 
We are meant to protect too, not loving each other 
Like. Ah, we are living in the modern day. Slavery 
Humans are baked like a burning bread, bakery 
Selfish interest scales more than the real gains 
How. Can we now settle for freedom while in these strong chains? 
Would? U blame it on me! 
Or blame it on: u 
Or blame it on the people outside? U never knew 
Or blame it on the leaders who don't wan na, show examples, 
Come out and say the truth, and you will end up in dem bangles .. 
 
Insecurity in this nation is like a broomstick 
Locked behind bars, 
And water scooped, with a chopstick 
Our Voices are mellowed 
Talk and get killed by some leaders in a hunting game. Well-Skilled 
Lack of unity made our boundaries so porous, so everything wey dey happen. Here
Dey make my heart bother me: 
I represent the truth. 
No murder me 
Oluwa's handmade impunity. Cover me. 
Where ARE THE GIRLS THEY WAN NA GO HOME 
Let's get together, look for them, 
I'm, calling all zone 
God bless all those who are in for this fight, 
Rest in peace to y'all who lost their lives on the bomb blasts. ... 
 
This Song is Written.
