Blinded Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


All this ice leave me blinded.
Five star life, stay reminded.
Bitch I done grinded.
I pull up with designer, if you.
with it lean behind it.
All these lights leave you blinded.
Five star life, stay reminded.
Bitch I done grinded.
I pull up with designer, if you with.
it lean behind it.

Bitch I'm cruising down the black lodge with black wrist watch.
Got a bad bitch sipping scotch popping tic-tacs.
Pull up with a black car gotta hit the snack bar.
Mitsubishi cruising down the lanes like its NASCAR.
They say I'm too bizarre, but I done make it this far.
Might smoke a fat jetpack out to Myanmar.
Feeling like a movie star, counting stacks with my boys in a sushi bar.

Uh no you won't get this far, bitch I bet you know who we are.
Wake up and I see dark, never let the dogs bark.
Leave you looking like a question mark.

Bands to the ceiling, smoke away all my feelings.
I be, I be getting rich bitch.
I just came to say.
Left an addict, I guess I meant that i'm an addict.
You can't spit, my money standing looking like cabbage.
Hashish steady taking trips living.
lavish.
