Art-I-Ficial Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

I know I'm artificial 
But, don't put the blame on me. 
I was reared with appliances 
In a consumer society, 
 
When I put on my make-up 
The pretty little mask, not me 
That's the way a girl should be 
In. A consumer society. 
 
My existence is elusive. 
The kind that is supported, 
By mechanical resources, 
 
My existence is elusive, 
The kind that is supported, 
By mechanical resources, 
 
I wan na be instamatic 
I wan na be a frozen pea. 
I wannna be dehydrated 
In, a consumer society, 
 
In, a consumer society; 
In a consumer society
