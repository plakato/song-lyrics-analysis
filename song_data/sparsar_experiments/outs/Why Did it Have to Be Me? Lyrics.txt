Why Did it Have to Be Me? Lyrics
by Sweet Tee.

The first day that we met, it was love at first sight.
You were my thoughts everyday and dreams every night.
This was it and I knew it cause it felt so strong.
In my heat and my soul that this love would be life long.
But you were to fine and I was too blind to see all the games that you.
Played with my mind.
All the agony...baby can't you see.
I asked you time and time was there someone else.
You always said no thinking of yourself.
Not that I'd be hurt or torn apart.
Didn't make a difference if you broke my heart in two.
Cause you knew how much I loved you.
Everything you say, everything you do.
I could go on and on and on like a chant.
But to forgive you I just can't.
Now I know it wasn't meant to be.
But why did it have to be me.

Why did it have to be me?
Please tell me why?
Why did it have to me?
Tell me, Tell me,tell me.

You know it use to be great.
Just you and me.
You'd take my hand and we'd walk down by the sea.
I remember when you asked me to be yours I said yes.
Because without a doubt, I knew I had the best.
You bought gold and diamonds, and furs.
A car, a house with towels marked his and hers.
You'd hold me so tight that I'd wanna pop.
But then I'd whisper in your ear, don't stop.
Things started changing, what did I do wrong.
To have you pouring my heart into this love song.
You'd leave in the evening, return in the morning.
Say that you're tired, but you're not even yawning.
You smell real good, but it's not your cologne.
It's the scent of a perfume that I don't own.
Now I know it wasn't meant to be.
But why did it have to me.

Please tell me why, why did it have to me.
Please tell me why, Tell me, tell me.

You know, one thing you'll learn is true.
What you do to others will turn around and be done to you.
It's the way The Almighty made it you see.
Those who give pain will receive it eventually.
Cause love is secrete, love is loving, love is love.
It can't be replaced with anything you can think.
But one day its gonna happen to you.
The girl that you loved, she won't love you.
Then you'll see how it feels when you can't eat meals.
And you find out the heartaches are for real.
Then you'll think about me.
Just think about me.
But don't call me.
Because you'll be looking in the mirror and asking yourself.
Why did it have to me?
Why me? Why me?
