B.R.L.D. Lyrics
by Unleash The Sky.

That voice down in your head.
The good and the bad.
It sounds familiar but strange.
All these things you cannot change.

Pictures without a frame.
Drawn by thoughts without a name.
This is a never-ending story.

Your life is calling, it´s calling for a change.
You better listen, it's never too late.
Your life is waiting, it´s waiting for a try.
Don't let this life pass you by.

That downward spiral up high.
Born and raise and love and die.
Make every second worthwhile.
In your puzzle that's called life.

Things to do before you die.
Face the world, kiss it goodbye.
In a blaze of glory.
In a never-ending story.
