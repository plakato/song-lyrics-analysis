Bands (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Quilly.


Fish Scale on the Block we Goin Fishing 
Ain't nothin on it, though the work skinny-dippin 
Put it in the pot call it synchronizing swimming 
Next Day 20k bussin out My Linen 
I ain't got this Glock for nothin Nigga. I Send dem 
All these bad Bitches get curved. After i bend dem 
Niggas think they fuckin wit, Quilly it ain't there, though 
These niggas, you think thurl they all weirdos 
I get a baldy kill you let my hair grow. 
I stand in the Field by myself like A Scarecrow 
I used to fronted stack, packs, bringin, nickel packs 
Now. I send niggas Outta town bring me triple back 
Yea. I made myself a boss, 
I used to want lo, but i settled for lacoste 
Doctor. Give me lean. I make myself cough 
I ain't know how to pitch. I made myself tall 
If, I get the drop you get sent to the sky, 
I send niggas in ya. Crib Xfinity Live 
Fake trap, niggas, talkin bout, flippin, dem, pies, 
They ain't even touch pastries, Im sicker than lies: 
I gotcha bitch at the loft slidin dick up her thighs 
These bitches givin up the puss. They shoulda listened to Piles 
Nigga you Rue Paul. I can see the bitch in ya eyes: 
Remind me of Bruce Jenner, Just A bitch in Disguise, 
I make a smoker wipe my wheel off, give em advice a .20 piece. Then i Peel off 
If I'on owe my publishing. I cut the whole deal off. 
Just left Phlipe's and i Knocked my whole Meal off 
Quilly Eatin good, no, more PB,
