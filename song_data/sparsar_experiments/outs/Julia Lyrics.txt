Julia Lyrics
by Vitesse.

Julia was afraid to love me.
She wouldn't let me into her heart.
She always had a slight suspicion.
That rock'n'roll would drive us apart.

Julia couldn't stand showbusiness.
On radio, tv, and the press.
Where gimmicks are attracting attention.
Breaking artist more or less.

Julia, let me into your heart.
Julia, you're tearing me apart.

Julia had to keep some distance.
She really was afraid to be hurt.
By just another rock'n'roller.
Running 'round as free as a bird.

Julia, let me into your heart.
Julia, you're tearing me apart.

Julia's in fear of some music in here.
Julia's in fear of some music in here.

Julia, let me into your heart.
Julia, let me into your heart.
Julia, let me into your heart.
Julia, let me into your heart.
