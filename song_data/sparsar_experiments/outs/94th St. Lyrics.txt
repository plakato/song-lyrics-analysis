94th St. Lyrics
by The World Alive.


We can't keep running in circles.
Have we lost our minds?
We can't keep running in circles.
Have we lost our minds?

We search for the meaning that we can't find.
We hope for the answers in time.
But we all believe of love, life.

What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
This so clean just sedation.
And losing trust in here.
Loving, fight for resolution.
Let the morning come again.

Refrain.
I can't keep running in circles.
The dangers live in your mind.
I can't keep crashing in, take of my life.

I can't take control.
The absence of what we all know.
So redefine to reason.
Too far away to let go.

We can't keep running in circles.
