How To Love Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

La la la.
La la la.
La la la.

How to love.
How to love.
How to love.
Learn how to love.

Seems like we've got our share of differences.
We can't even agree to disagree.
Talking when we should be listening.
So trynna to meet our needs.
Is an impossibility.
You say.
But I say.
It's all just the same.
No one takes the blame.
But the conclusion still will remain.

That there's no sense in fighting.
About who's wrong or right when.
There's no end in sight so.
We both need to learn how to love.
Maybe there might be.
A chance even slightly.
If we both agree.
We both need to learn how to love.

How to love.
How to love.
How to love.
Learn how to love.

Seems like we're guarding our hearts again.
Trust is the key that we're missing so bad.
Protecting our past pains and our scars.
Losing our character so we don't know how to act.
You say.

But I say.
It's all just the same.
No one takes the blame.
And the conclusion still will remain.

There's no sense in fighting.
About who's wrong or right when.
There's no end in sight so.
We both need to learn how to love.
Maybe there might be.
A chance even slightly.
If we both agree.
We both need to learn how to love.

How to love.
How to love.
How to love.
Learn how to love.

If we were just learn this one thing.
We could both have everything.
Respect mutually, love faith and honesty.
And we both know.

There's no sense in fighting.
About who's wrong or right when.
There's no end in sight so.
We both need to learn how to love.
Maybe there might be.
A chance even slightly.
If we both agreev We both need to learn how to love.

How to love.
How to love.
How to love.
Learn how to love.
