Lucifer - naked edition Lyrics
by XOV.

I want him to meet his maker 
I used to be a lover. Now, I'm a hater 
My passion to succeed is watching him bleed 
Oh lord. What have become of me 
Once upon a time I was a fool: 
To cool for school gangster, cruel 
Blood in blood out, pull the trigger. No doubt 
Lucky motherfucker, you don't know what I'd do to you. 
I used to kick it with Lucifer 
And. He still lingers in the dark 
Oh. Oh Lucifer, 
The evil within has never been greater. 
My soul has been seized and he's the dictator 
I've been dragged through the mud. I can still taste the blood 
Oh lord. What have become of me 
Once upon a time I was a fool: 
To cool for school gangster, cruel 
Blood in blood out, pull the trigger. No doubt 
Lucky motherfucker, you don't know what I'd do to you. 
I used to kick it with Lucifer 
And. He still lingers in the dark 
Oh. Oh Lucifer, 
You, better watch out 
Sometimes, I feel like seeking him down just for the hell of it. 
Look for his face around town smack smack just a bit. 
Lucky motherfucker got away with my cash 
I built you up and I'mma tear you down just like that. 
Once upon a time I was a fool: 
To cool for school gangster, cruel 
Blood in blood out, pull the trigger. No doubt 
Lucky motherfucker, you don't know what I'd do to you. 
I used to kick it with Lucifer 
And. He still lingers in the dark 
Oh. Oh Lucifer, 
You, better watch out 
The devil's been an angel 
The devil's been an angel 
Even. The devil's been an angel 
Lucifer 
The devil's, been an angel 
The devil's been an angel 
Even. The devil's been an angel 
Lucifer
