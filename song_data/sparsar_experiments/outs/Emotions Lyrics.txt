Emotions Lyrics

Produced By Mike Free.

Playing with my money is like playing with my emotions.
Don't be playing with my emotions.
I just want them dollar signs, money bag emojis.
I just want the money bags.
Don't be playing with mine.
Don't be playing with mine.
Don't be playing with mine.
Don't be playing with mine.

Playing with my money, that's like playing with my feelings.
Fuck making a living, shit I'd rather make a killing.
I ain't tryna talk unless I know how much I'm spending.
You ain't a fool, bitch you know the rules.
And I can't let you bend em.
Niggas gone play around with my bag, might just make me mad.
If you fuck around with my sack, watch how I react.
If you fumble with my cash, then you know that's your ass.
Prolly show you more respect if you just bring it back.
I got niggas that owe me some favors.
Have him run off in your spot, we'll split the paper.
I got a million ways to earn bread, pussy niggas turn fed.
Never trust a sherm head, tell em like big worm said.

Playing with my money, that's like playing with my emotions.
I just want them dollar signs, money bag emojis.
Even when I'm full I be still money hungry.
I be still money hungry.
I ain't tryna wait, I'll take mines to go.
If you ain't got my cake, better have my dough.
Bet I pull up on your block and see you on your post.
Like ? from ATL, catch you at the store.
You can keep the chromes, I want Dej Loaf.
Blow money like a fan, that's what it's made for.
Made these stripper bitches grab a rain coat.
And if I pull up then you know just what I came for.
