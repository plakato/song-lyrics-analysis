Complete Lyrics
by Vivian Green.


You love me incredibly.
From my head to the soles of my feet.
You know you make me complete, baby.

And you love me outstandingly.
Can't contain it.
Need a moment to breathe.
Keep on loving me, baby.

What a blessing.
How you found me.
How you conquered me.
And showed me showed me so much.
Just how it should be.

Sometimes I wake up when you've sleeping.
Just to watch you dream.
I kiss your eyelids.
And tell you thank you for this reality.

When you're away from me.
I wait anxiously.
Sometimes I barely sleep.
Cause I'm just so used to you.
Being wrapped up in you in between our sheet.

I'm so excited for the future.
What we're gonna be.
I've got this glow.
Everyone knows someone is.
Loving me.

Oh, you do something to me.
When you look in my eyes.
The very touch of you brings me life.

It's the ultimate crazy stuff.
Just amazing love.
Keep it coming to me cause.
