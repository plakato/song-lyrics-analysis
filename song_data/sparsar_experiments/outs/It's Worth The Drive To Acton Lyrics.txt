It's Worth The Drive To Acton Lyrics
by Sydney.

She walked gingerly past as I said goodbye and.
It's that simple.
We're both ready to go.

It's like fire.
Breaking water.
We'll never be the same and.
I'll never turn my back on you again.

Now I can see the light.
But now I see the light is fading.
I'm failing, stuck wailing.
Out like a nightingale detuned.

And that the last thing I want.
And I know you want it back:.
where we could walk bearing skin.
Under the gold reflection.

Tame this awkward pause with and broken jaw.
Man I never knew you could hit that hard.
And of all the days you chose today.
I just couldn't think of what to say.

So cut the lights now.
Make it so we only see your eyes.
No not the fashion, its just your clique that I despise.
So what's your poison?
Well I thought you took the same as mine.
Why weren't you talking?
I guess ill give you some more time.
Oh My God this night will never end.

With all the distant days and suffering.
I wish I could cut short.
Empty promises that you have made these past few years.
Under the black sky all the dreams just don't seem alright.
Take this last breath and throw it all away.

All the news reports disasters.
Teenage sitcoms with aging actors.
Mother and son.
The bond is broken.

My God I'm trying.
Yes I'm trying.
Give me one last chance.

With all the distant days and suffering.
I wish I could cut short.
Empty promises that you have made these past few years.
Under the black sky all the dreams just don't seem alright.
Take this last breath and throw it all away.
