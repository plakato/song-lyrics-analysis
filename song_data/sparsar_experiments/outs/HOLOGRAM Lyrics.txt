HOLOGRAM Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Underneath the cold moon.
In the parking lot I told you.
Didn't even know you'd take back the hours we wasted.
We're frozen in the headlights.
We're slipping on the black ice.
Shouldn't have to act nice.
Blood in the air, I could taste it.

So I felt like you were neutral the night you said that you were home.
You played me like a musical.
Said ignorance is beautiful.
I felt like you were neutral the night you said that you were home.
?

You said you wouldn't.
But you did it.
Why you lying?
I ain't kidding.
Hands numb, can't feel.
This love's not real.
Now I'm finding.
Your handwriting.
'Cross the ceiling.
Close my eyes and say, How'd I get here?
This love's not real.

I lost touch with who I am.
I am just a hollow man.
In love with a hologram.
This castle is made of sand.
I am just a hollow man.
In love with a hologram.

Double yellow lines like.
Slipping in the back night.
I'm losing all my lifelines.
Never thought you could erase them.

This world is full of hypocrites and bitches claiming innocence.
You see I just came to witness it.
And leave here with no fingerprints.
This world is full of hypocrites and bitches claiming innocence.
We wanted ? to be the prince, but.
it's incestuous.

You said you wouldn't.
But you did it.
Why you lying?
I ain't kidding.
Hands numb, can't feel.
This love's not real.
Now I'm finding.
Your handwriting.
'Cross the ceiling.
Close my eyes and say, How'd I get here?
This love's not real.

I lost touch with who I am.
I am just a hollow man.
In love with a hologram.
This castle is made of sand.
I am just a hollow man.
In love with a hologram.

Cold sweat, shaking with the fever dream.
Go back to the same crime scene.
Now my ears baby won't stop ringing.
My ears, yeah, they won't stop ringing.
Cold sweat, shaking with the fever dream.
Go back to the same crime scene.
Now my ears, yeah, they won't stop ringing.

I lost touch with who I am.
I am just a hollow man.
In love with a hologram.
This castle is made of sand.
I am just a hollow man.
In love with a hologram.

Clean me in your river.
You can wash me with your water.
Purify me till I shiver.
Cause I've been seeing ghosts.
Is this me finally losing it?
Or an optical illusion?
Every beat I make is unfinished.
And every song I write is ill conceived.
When all the cities fade and we diminish.
Will anyone remember you and me?
