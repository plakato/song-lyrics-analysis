Alone Apart Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

How many times have I been here.
How many times was I lost.
And how many times I'd be drown in the sea.
If you weren't there to rescue me.

We're sailing, we're sailing every night.
We're drifting, we're drifting alone apart.
Not to show that we're in need.
But I'd heal your wounds if you bleed.

How many times have I hurt you.
How many times have you.
And how many times I'd been on my knees.
Begging, begging please forgive me.

We're sailing, we're sailing every night.
We're drifting, we're drifting alone apart.
Not to show that we're in need.
But I'd heal your wounds if you bleed.

Thank you for being so patient with me.
I've been weaker than I ought to be.
Despair and jealousy blinded my mind.
And I couldn't see how you're trying for me.
