Gots 2 Be Everything Lyrics
by Yungstar.


I'ma bring spice to your life brang heat to your summer.
Indo beaches in my crib glass bullet proof hummer.
I'm shakin off all these leaches.
Leave these ghetto girls speechless.
Twin boppers by my side this strawberry thats peaches.
Candy drip on that leather.
Got my groove back with Stella.
Riding north to the moon light cause of the millenium jetter.
To much ice for us both cause I'm a south-western soldier.
I'm knocking singles off the shelves like my name Sammy Sosa.
Lord ways gotta get better way for met o show.
Pop me a meter and don't show until four.
A million ways to get paid.

And a z for a faid.
I'm the neighbor hood jimmy.
Slash heavy weight menace.
I don flip a flock a birds like a nation wide gymnist.
24 hours maintaning doors tall like chambers.
Went to trial and judge judy hit me with open containers.
Cuz I'm everthing.

Gon be everything I gots to get mine.
It takes time to shine thats my reason for rhymes.
On cloud 9 I'm fine tring to walk the thin line.
Put the past behind move forward and grind.
Ain't nothing change in my game bout me being Lil' James.
I can't settle for less I gots to be everything.
Blowing jane swangin and grain makin you hoes look strange.
Its a shame how they complain about me having thangs.
I want fortune not fame paid clothes and remains.
Cause if ain't about faces then it don't make sense.
I'm on the roll to success another complishment.
Acomodated resident my butler will brang refreshment.
Chit chat is inrelevent on facts so I'm tellin.
Moving swift house clever swangin glass on leather.
We paid livin laid never change like the weather.
Sout west forever and I'm stackin my ends.
Show room benz in the wind sippin syrup and hen.
Chandiller in my den two yellow twinz to get in.
Why peep I got 2 be everything so I attend to win.

2x.
I got 2 be everything we mashin for dreams.
Head high to the sky we on the mission for green.
Ain't no stopping ain't no holding down we TYP.
Throwed yung playas staying throwed staying real in the streets.

Hold up slow up thast cause my flow is being laid.
Chillin Fubu down while my butler get a fade.
Butt naked mermaids sittin in the water in my foutain.
On the flow high above as I climb my moutain.
Steady climbing bound to show nothing but ass.
CEO killa flow game tight better--respected.
Getting paid livin laid say so many in the wall.
Take a trip to faucet feel like you at the mall.
How high I'm gone ball heres a splinter from the oaks.
Back then in mr crib seven cadis on spokes.
We gone smoke till I fall better yet lets sip till I lean.
Gold steds in my castle rail made of bezeltine.
European big body and a yellow riding bus.
51 and tvs with my customized truck hold up.

We gone smoke till we gone we all know thats its on.
Plus you wanna see me clown I'm 19 with a new home.
You don't got mine cause I got lap tech.
Chart stretch my metra veck wanna take a bet on the monster ed.
They dress for that they'll never forget.
Guess I must be in it.
Cause I'm sexual bendit.
Not to mention body guards with tentions.
I'm knockin doors off your hinches.
Count my spoke count my inches.
I'm on the role to make impressions.
Not only I climb it but I flaunt so you know I'm a legend.
In the pint black dome while its gone to keep my chrome from scrilla.
Young imperior like a adena peri flippin apple over silver.
All of this bumpin let you coming all this a joke.
Knock platinum piece on the table just jump in like the pope.
They can't stop Striaght Profit around taking cops for hall of fame.
From Main to Spain they know my name.
I'm sporting straight with a pinky rang.
