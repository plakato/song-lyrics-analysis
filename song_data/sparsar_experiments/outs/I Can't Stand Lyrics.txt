I Can't Stand Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

It's not easy to fall in love.
But if you're lucky, you just might find someone.
So don't let it get you down.
No don't let it get you down.
Cause in the end, you're only one.
Yes, in the end, you're only one.

It's not easy to fall in love.
But if you're lucky you might find someone.
So don't let it get you down.
I can't stand to see you this way.
It's going to be alright.

It's not easy to let it all go.
But once in awhile, it's good for your soul.
So don't let it get you down.
No don't let it get you down.
Cause in the end, you're on your own.
Yes in the end you're on your own.

It's not easy to let it all go.
But once in awhile it's good for your soul.
I can't stand to see you this way.
It's going to be alright.
