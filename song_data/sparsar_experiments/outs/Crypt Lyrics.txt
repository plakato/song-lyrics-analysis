Crypt Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Captured here within a quiet tomb, yet not surrounded by the dead.
Covered in a shroud of misery, whispers hover in our midst.
Ragged few have shared this consequence, but the choice was ours in a way.
Full of hope, yet still despondent, will light ever come again?
Shout, unfortunate warden, the time for chains is ended.

Crawl out from this cage, feel warmth upon your face, as you step into the sun.
This tender breeze, meant only for the free, which you'll not be for long,.
your time is done.

Dark passageways never end, only glimpses caught between the.
Bars of our cell, moving forward yet never terminating anywhere.

Bound to the crypt.
Darkness fills my soul and skin.
Bound, I fall from sin.
Blackened spirit, past within.
The time for chains is ended.

Crawl out from this cage, feel warmth upon your face, as you step into the sun.
This tender breeze, meant only for the free, which you'll not be for long,.
your time is done.
