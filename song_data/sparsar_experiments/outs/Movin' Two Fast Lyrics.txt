Movin' Two Fast Lyrics
by Wrekless.


Guess we got ta slow it down now, 
Think, I'm movin' too fast for her 
Think, I'm moving too fast, 
 
I said I figured I'd. Try this 
Hoping! They like that 
Trying to figure where my pride is'til. You came right back 
And. I figure I'm in need of a little therapy and a good dose of music 
So. Give me a couple months and I'll be right. Back 
Observing life through the sky rise high view, 
I'm the type of dude to take a climb and a dive too 
With a beautiful dime brown skin and she bomb 
As, a mine or grenade with a shine like a diamond 
Pilot physique got me high as a Cloud is 
Drug she my heroin, but I ain't Amy wine-ing 
Searching through her treasure chest heart trying to find it 
Love double excel at the right time.
