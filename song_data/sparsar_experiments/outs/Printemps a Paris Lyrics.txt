Printemps a Paris Lyrics
by The sweet remains.

Moonlight on the Champs-Elysee.
Will you walk with me.
Past the Louvre et le Musee D'orsay.
To the Isle de La City.

Oh La La.
C'est tres jolie.

Shall we float in a boat down the Seine with a glass of wine.
Have you tried the Chardonnay, well, I hear its quite divine.
Oh La La.
C'est tres jolie.

Shall we stroll to the top of Sacre Coeur and take in the city below.
We'll watch for trains as they roll through the rain and hear their whistles.
blow.
Oh La La.
C'est tres jolie.

We'll take a rest at a cozy caf√© on a quiet side street.
I'll give a kiss that's tender and sweet and I'll look at you and say.
Oh La La.
C'est tres jolie.
