Plastic Beach Lyrics
by The 3rd Kind.

Capital STEEZ.
Welcome to the world.
Of close encounters.
With JaY STEEZ &amp; Jakk The Rhymer.

See, See don't catch me on the wrong note.
But dudes is tryna stop me from droppin' like a bar of soap.
Im gettin' shine but dudes with simple minds.
Cause me to show whats on the inside, autoshows.
Hold the phone, cause I know I heard it all before.
I can't hold back for too long like porter notes.
Good luck, see you rappers with a lot of hope.
You won't be around next year with them akward flows.
And snap rappers just stop all your gimmicks.
Lonely stoners I rock more than Clinic.
It's the apex chemist who got all the lyrics.
With no plans of stoppin' I'm not gonna finish.
Man date in heaven, Third Kind Dynasty.
It's obvious that I can see why they hatin' silently.
Yeah we get psyched to see.
But you was nice as me and still wanna bite the steez.

I sound so hip-hop, its contagious to me.
I write with a rage, outrageously and seamless.
So the pages be, floatin' in the back of mind.
And occupying vacancies.
They say he twice the MC, I double that stop it!
And spit bubble wrap so you know who's poppin'.
Rough a track up, and I leave it closed coffin.
With the force of no other.
Close encounter, skywalkin'.
Okay Mr. wordplay, do your best work.
Came in alright, let's see how the left work.
Nice with the textbook, iller with the rap knowledge.
Heard ya guy spit now all quick they gotta dot com us.
Honest, and it's straight off the forehead.
Ya the beef sweet, we kicks it like warheads.
The lyricism leave MC's in danger.
That's how we stay ahead and arrest, rap ranger!
