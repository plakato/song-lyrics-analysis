End Transmission Lyrics
by Sydney.

It's universal down on this planet we won't ever leave.
Did you know I really hate to say this, but you and I.
I never thought we'd make it.
This galaxy it spins in motion motionless to me.
Did you know I really hate to say this, but you and I.
I never thought we'd make it.
Just sky let the sky fold and fall into quiet sleep.
Just let the sky take hold of us.
We're so close but you're shaking far too much.
Just let the sky take hold of us.
We're so close but you're shaking far too much.
Just let the sky take hold of us.
We're so close but you're shaking far too much.
Just let the sky take hold of us.
We're so close but you're shaking far too much.
You're shaking far too much.

And it's gone.
Yes, it's over.
And the moment again passed us by.
As the sun it takes over one more night that we live and let die.
So long farewell I'll take it as a compliment and I'll hope to break it.
I know you're really suffering, but that's the way I had to make it.
So long farewell I'll take it as a compliment and I'll promise to break it.
I know you're really suffering, but that's the way I had to make it.
So long farewell I'll take it as it comes.
I'll take it as it comes.
And that's the way I hope to take it.

Just let her die one more time.
Let her die one more time.
Turn it up one more time.

Well then if that's the case just turn around just turn around.
I cannot handle this I'll drown it out I'll drown it out.
And for the sake of us just kill the sound just kill the sound.
Why I have to you.
Well then if that's the case just turn around just turn around.
I cannot handle this I'll drown it out I'll drown it out.
And for the sake of us just kill the sound just kill the sound.
Why I have to.

I'm not gonna try to be catchy or cliche.
Or write about what I haven't actually encountered in my life.
I just wanna know what the f**k I'm singing about.
And honestly, isn't everyone sick of people who think TV is reality?
Because sometimes I feel like I'm living in a never ending episode of Dawson's.
Creek.
But oh, Scott, the kids deal with real life issues!
F**k that!
The truth is, we're just a bunch of 20 year old kids who really like music.
We play what we like and feel sorry for those to serene, who think we are.
ruining music.
The death cab is waiting outside.
Music isn't a competition, its a compilation of ideas.
One bands success surely does not mean ones failure.
Fighting should be left for those with bombs big enough to end it.
And the last time I checked, I never wrote a bomb.
Or have I?
Just ignore those around you.
So sit outside your petty bullshit.
Just be cool!
Cause some day this will all be over and you will be alone.
And being alone doesn't look that cool.
The End!

So now I got five more tries just to make things right.
I shouldn't settle for less but I think I might.
So just drive away though i wish you'd stay.
I know it's easy for you but I'm just not the same.

So now I got four more tries just to make things right.
I shouldn't settle for less but I think I might.
So just drive away though i wish you'd stay.
I know it's easy for you but I'm just not the same.

So now I got three more tries just to make things right.
I shouldn't settle for less but I think I might.
So just drive away though i wish you'd stay.
I know it's easy for you but I'm just not the same.

So now I got two more tries just to make things right.
I shouldn't settle for less but I think I might.
So just drive away though i wish you'd stay.
I know it's easy for you but I'm just not the same.

So now I got one more try just to make things right.
I shouldn't settle for less but I think I might.
So just drive away though i wish you'd stay.
I know it's easy for you but I'm just not the same.
