Geyan Orjon Competition Lyrics
by Punkstah.

Let me give you a simple example of my daily day
Peoples. Life is full of colors, my one's just grey
And. I just hate it. When a sun ray hits my face
Cus, i got ta wake up and deal bullshit all day
14, bochor, koira porashuna you. I ain't smart enough. 
Bba korei boro chakri, you think i dont know: thats a bluff, 
Eiguli shunle manush bhabe dekho chele ta be-adob
Tara amare bhoy dekhay bole mathay, naki, porbe, gojob
Gojob, porle, poruk, ga er jonno, ki shotto komu na 
Shotto koite dorai na oto, tuk shahosh, dise, allah, 
Shara din. Nana pressure e jibon, ta amar, tej, pata
Jodi togo, o ei obostha taile amr loge, matha jhaka
You want my future to be good. Yes, i do know that
But it ain't helping cus. All u give is bullcrap
You have to understand. There is generation gap
So much pain. You give you're still my mom and dad
