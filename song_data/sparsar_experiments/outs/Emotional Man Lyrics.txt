Emotional Man Lyrics
by Xandria.

Watch my poster on the wall.
View my pictures on the magazines you store to have them all.
Let me be your guiding light.
Be the salt inside the wounds of your most ordinary life.
Come closer - what you want is what you see.
Desire - but you won't dare talk to me.
So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man.
So clean and shy - get it while you can.
And yes, what I am is not what you see.
Your interest's somewhere else.
Your carnal longings make you all the same.
Writing letters, sending mails.
Offering me your honest interest in what's inside of me.
No sins on your mind, of course.
Pretend to intellectualize another wasted girl resource.
You tell me - you knew what I need.
So sorry - for the hypocrit I feed.
So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man.
So clean and shy - get it while you can.
And yes, what I am is not what you see.
Your interest's somewhere else.
Your carnal longings make you all the same.
Just a number in a game - you tell me I had a name.
Creation of an industry - and not what you might think to see.
Glorify an icon's shrine - whose image of me is not mine.
Not to save you from your mess - tell you you may kiss....
So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man.
So clean and shy - get it while you can.
And yes, what I am is not what you see.
So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man.
So clean and shy - get it while you can.
And yes, what I am is not what you see.
Your interest's somewhere else.
Your carnal longings make you all the same.
