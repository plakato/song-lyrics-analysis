St.Hood Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Ivory tower academic, you can expect him/.
To have troubling looking in the mirror, learning to accept it/.
See, cause I can read a book called ‘The Problem of Pain'/.
That shows pain isn't my problem at all, cause it truly ain't/.
My real problems are cowardice, privilege, and status/.
I was born white but when I'm blamed for it, I just can't stand it/.
Our preliminary anguish/ begins with military language/.
Expressing our sorrow to all those who can't understand it/.
Screaming at Heaven “What the Hell?!”, don't ask what is hell? /.
They living through it, their wish is at the bottom of the well/.
So consider me a Goonie, not a Chris Columbus/.
Cause I've seen poverty's riches, they yearning for Justice/.
At my life I am disgusted/ so blessed are the destitute/.
Share a lot with the rest of you/ but we better learn.
To discuss if/ we are the deadly dreaded discontents/.
Of a civilization God never meant to exist/.

Welcome to St.Hood/.
Whether on the block or in a mansion, you know shit ain't good/.
Welcome to St.Hood/.
Wonder if Heaven got a ghetto? Yup, its here so stay put /.
Welcome to St.Hood/.
Whether on the block or in a mansion, you know shit ain't good/.
Welcome to St.Hood/.
Where Pains are lessons, and revolution brews life that tastes good/.

Money is the motive, tax 'n' control'em/.
Japedo is my homie, generation raised off hot dogs 'n' bologna/.
‎Only hope in the lotto/.
Ain't no such thing as starting from the bottom of the bottle uh/.
But we still here/.
Momma told me if u wanna stack the paper gotta get a career/.
Only when I'm sober minded is my judgment clear/.
And the media reminds me of what it looks like to live in fear/.
Cops 'n' robbers, stocks 'n' Bala clavas, Iraq gun shot non stop gotta survive.
it.
By any means necessary/.
Fiends for the green no such thing as fighting fairly/.
Hosting party as bohemian grove no joke/.
United snakes don't play the game, they pave the road/.
Two lanes with only one way to go.
Maintain capital gain price tags on your soul.../.

My Grandmother keeps sending us lottery tickets/.
But that's just a tax on the stupid and the Poverty stricken/.
Imagine if 50 Million is what they're giving away/.
What they got in their pocket, from the shit that you play/.
Grabbing your keys and coins to scratch up your Bingo cards/.
Like their petitions to God/ to change your positional stars/.
So look at all the people reading ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad'/.
They ain't got time to study politics or know what's NORAD/.
Sometimes I feel like unions arguing over their payment/.
Are just a bunch of slaves, talking about their wages/.
So thank you McGuinty for my tuition discount/.
Maybe I shouldn't bite the hand that feeds me or take this route/.
I fully understand that I'm in a privileged class/.
But that don't mean Capitalism was ever fit to last/.
Or that my comfort, is an excuse for injustice/.
So I desire the Kingdom of God, nothing else but this/.
