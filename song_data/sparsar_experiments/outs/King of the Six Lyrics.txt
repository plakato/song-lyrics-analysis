King of the Six Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


Catching opps, that's the opps 
I woke up feeling like I was 22 
Catch. Your ass loafing put you on the news. 
Bitch we, the kings of the six x8 
 
I, woke up feeling like I was NumbaNine 
Rocket launcher on my side. Get your ass fried 
Smoke! A lot of dead people need. I stay high 
And. What'S that pack, you smokin' on this, that KI 
On your drive pop outside niggas, always hide 
We, got all our guns out and we fucking slide. 
My shorties ball hoes. They all wan na shoot 
Fuck a loose screw we
turnt up for Lil Boo 
I woke up in the morning. Then I drunk a deuce 
Got, a glizzy on me boy, don't be no fool! 
Look at the ass on my bitch 
We spending cash in this bitch 
In traffic. We blastin'em'n shit 
And, we spazz in this shit with them ratchets and shit nigga, 
 
I'm, always on these blocks that ain't nothing new, 
I woke up feeling like I was Lil Boo. 
Better not try beef with the Six 
We got them glizzies and shit 
Spent the whole thing on my wrist 
I know you see me lil bitch 
Fuck, the Jakes CPDK 
Free, all our demons and shit 
It's me and Lil Dee on a hit 
We catch. You we leaving you bitch 
And RIP. My brother, L'A 
I know he seeing this shit 
Slide on the opps 
I. Don'T need no drillers, it's just me and Breezy. That'S it 
With the gang 
I'm with the gang 
Shoot these .223's through a nigga, face 
Six-O on your ass. You can't lack goofy 
Better tuck your chain before they snatch goofy
