Uh 
Something light 
A-Z 
Yo Niggas, just Kickin back with a nickel sack, 
SIKE 
Matter fact quadruple that 
Evaporating steams in the atmosphere 
I don't care anywhere 
Ashing ashes in Powerade bottles, 
Tilting down my glasses 
Eyes watering from my focus 
I zone out 
I pull my iPhone out. 
Felt a vibrate too late, so 
Now, it's a missed, call 
But shit dog. I ain't pissed off I drift off 
Then lift off come run with the big dogs. 
I be rappin Goulet, getting his mix on 
Max, getting his biz on weak rappers, getting shit on 
Bose speakers playing back this classic that Dilla mastered for the Pharcyde 
Out the archives. 
Tell me what art dies: 
Im Aziz, Warhol van Gogh, slash DaVinci, lyrical wizard 
Getting busy, like a buzzin intersection in a bigger city, 
At rush hour, headed to a performance and all my niggas touch sour 
Eating rappers at lunch hour, 
Im on the grind til, I got The spot up in the Trump towers 
And. Even then I ain't stopping man. I want a residence in every continent, 
Livin prominent world dominance, 
You should want it. Man, 
I'm Pinky and the Brain 
I need chicky, chickies witg me getting tipsy on a plane, 
I'm thinking on it. Mane 
2006 
And Beyond 
 
HAa
