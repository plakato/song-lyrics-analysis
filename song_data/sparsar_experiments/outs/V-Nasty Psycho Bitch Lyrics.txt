V-Nasty Psycho Bitch Lyrics
by V-Nasty.

Look at me I'm on the block with my niggas now 
Disrespect us and we gon na pull the pistols out. 
I heard you niggas ain't about what you be talkin bout 
But. I come into your house and leave you leakin on your couch, 
 
Now, a nigga can't speak bet. He shoulda watched his mouth 
Harder than your diamond. They let a real bitch out. 
I ain't. Do shit that you niggas seen on the news. 
They can't catch a bitch like me, I don't leave no clues. 
 
Tell the bitch to cut throw up the deuce 
Couldn't fuck with the bitch cuz, her pussy too loose 
I, kill, niggas and I touch
his baby momma 
Come back to her nigga, like my name, is karma 
Harder than karma. I'M a
bitch well known in the hood cuz. I get licked 
 
I, don't give a fuck and
I'm mobbin on the industry. 
Bitch you ain't a friend of me ho you is my enemy
