Colossal Freak Lyrics
by Volume.

60 foot sleeper and bigger than me.
Super freakin', tweakin'.
Down the river, trying to hide.
But there's nowhere to go.

I'm not wanted by the Earth.
I'm not wanted by the Earth.
I'm not wanted by the Earth.
Here I come.

Captured, tied down for all to see.
They just want to destroy.
What they don't understand.
They don't understand.
I don't understand.
Going to be shot down, put down.
But it's going to take more.
Than you got.

And I'm praying to a God for leaving.
And I know I'm not the only one.

Calling for the making.
Uninvited just like me.
Just like me, me, me.
Just like me, me, me.
Just like me.
