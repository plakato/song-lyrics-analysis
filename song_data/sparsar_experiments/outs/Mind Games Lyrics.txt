Mind Games Lyrics
by Woodie.

'Blackbird'.
Its 1993, somethings have been rough.
You know, they just made me hard.
I didn't like when people tried to punk me.
When people started carrying guns.
Shit.
Well anyways.
In 94... he got shot.
Which just started a big ol' thing.
Then a whole bunch of stuff happened.
'Woodie'.
Enemys grab your strap.
Cause woodies back.
With a SK choppa for your ass.
West trunk, norte√±o, earn my strap.
to the youngins livin fast.
Strapped and young with a lot to prove.
Dared anyone to make a move.
Buckin at those scraps in west bouelvard way back in 92.
Now its 99, been to hell and back.
Blackbird is gone, I dwell on that.
Nigga what could I have done to.
change the way shoot.
Went down wish I can bring him back.
This gangbangin done took its tole-al.
Drinkin golden to keep control.
To please my soul where the demons grow.
Gotta be true, realse its horns.
It won't let go.
So I keep on ridin.
Slide that clip in ready to drop them bodys.
Enemys to come get at me.
So your ass.......
I know when its time for me to go.
Im gonna die in a cloud of guns.
Wildcats dreams,..............
When negative thoughts in the back of my mind.
Gotta find a way to make that cavi.
Tied of seeing the homies broke gotta plan to have our lifes livin lavey.

Rappin about this life we lead.
Rappin about this blunt we shared.
But the diferent ways homies bled.
To keep eachother one step ahead.
When enemys aproach.
Should I run or should I kill.
Fuck running im gonna produce a murder with my steel.
What if your slippin without your strap.........
When enemys aproach.
Should I run or should I kill.
Fuck running im gonna produce a murder with my steel.
Im trying to keep my thoughts in check everyday.
I struggle to keep my mind sane.
Pull an ak and I can't tell.
Heaven and hell is playing mind games.
Through trials and tribulation.
I developed an act for paitience.
So im camoflauged and waitin.
When it comes to retalation.
Infrotration, servein, your spot, gotta plot.
So I don't get caught.
My click be hot by the cops.
What's up, they love to empty out antioch.
Therefore regaugin my tacticts.
The avergae soldier couldn't grasp it.
But ill leave it that.
Cause I know detective's try decoding my raps.
There trying to lock all of us up.
................
Killed the babys and locs.
They knew Snoop didn't kill nobody.
Instead sentence him to the most.
No, got the media on there side.
The media paves the nation wide.
They just relable the government.
..........
For the public eyes.
This world is bulit up of gangs.
Some are big and some are small.
FBI, CIA, norteno, crip, blood.
Were all set trippin.
But the ATF deciedes how many straps we get.
The DEA agents deciedes how much coke and heriorn is smuggled in.
And so on, it goes on.
From the top to the bottom.
Word to bottom.
Livin up in these streets.
Fuck you bitch.
And you ask me why I shot him.

I'd love to have a family.
A beautiful wife that under stands me.
Many sons and a daughter.
But to be a fater on the brink os sanitity.
Would it be fair.
If one day daddy disapeared.
Weather I lost my mind or lost my life.
Left with mommy to care.
Would they end up like me.
Its deffanitly a possibilty.
Just one of one thousand questions hittin me up.
Inside its killing me.
But if.
Come stickin by my lonely guns.
I protect my lil homie and have an army of some.
Fuck it.
I'll teach him everything that I know.
Make sure there'll become hard.
When blood attacks, cover there tracks.
Loyaty above all loss.
I gotta keep dreamin.
To keep them demons out my head.
So I don't snap.
I might pull my wig back.
Or your wig back.
I deal with it, in a full stare.
When im stable.
Better remain be able to keep those shady thoughts cradle.
Take it in.
Day by day.
Yo when the sun hits the night its fatle.
Look in the sky.
Peek a star.
Its blackbird tonight.
Im choppin it up With my big homie.
He might be gone, but he's still in my life.
Its impossible to seperate us.
Were one of the same spirit.
His flash is gone.
But his soul is on.
When he speaks to me.
I hear it.
The only difference is.
I walk on the earth, still caught up in drama.
But whem my number....

'Blackbird'.
Whenever you wanna talk to me.
Ill be listening don't worry.
'Woodie'.
Hear that home boys.
He's still with us.
Just not in the flesh.
Woodie watching over all of us.
Ill see you in a minute los.
I love ya.
Ill bring a 40 if I can.
Yeah and I love all my family.
All my homies.
Ya know.
I never turn my back on any of ya.
How could I.
Look what snoop did.
Loyalty above all loss.
