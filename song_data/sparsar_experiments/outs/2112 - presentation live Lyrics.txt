2112 - presentation live Lyrics
by Rush.

... In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of.
grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent.
voice echoed throughout the silent Temple Hall. ....
... Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet.
rejection! Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror.
as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his.
feet....
I know it's most unusual.
To come before you so.
But I've found an ancient miracle.
I thought that you should know.
Listen to my music.
And hear what it can do.
There's something here as strong as life.
I know that it will reach you.
Yes, we know, it's nothing new.
It's just a waste of time.
We have no need for ancient ways.
The world is doing fine.
Another toy will help destroy.
The elder race of man.
Forget about your silly whim.
It doesn't fit the plan.
I can't believe you're saying.
These things just can't be true.
Our world could use this beauty.
Just think what we might do.
Listen to my music.
And hear what it can do.
There's something here as strong as life.
I know that it will reach you.
Don't annoy us further!
We have our work to do.
Just think about the average.
What use have they for you?
Another toy will help destroy.
The elder race of man.
Forget about your silly whim.
It doesn't fit the Plan!
