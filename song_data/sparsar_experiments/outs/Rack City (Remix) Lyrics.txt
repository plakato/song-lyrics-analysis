Rack City (Remix) Lyrics
by Yung DSJ.

Drop it to the floor make me want it more.
I gotta couple dollas if you do it on the pole.
May be under age but we do this thing fa sure.
Middle finger to the hataz now we outta control.
Rack rack city chick hangin like a cabinet.
Eyes stuck on that booty kinda like a maganet.
Haters we ain't having it.
Money we be bagging it.
She be all over me kinda like a lamanent.
Take her to the suite you can bet we dodge ramming it.
Then I send her on her way wit no need to be stamping it.
Flyer than a pilot ain't no person that be landin it.
She treat me like her test late night steady cramming it.
Rack Rack city chick she a rack city chick.
Money on her mind with killer thoughts if you tricking it.
Seen me comin in and was saying oh that kid be whipping it.
Took me to her private room money she ain't mention it.
Took out mr Benjamin and she started loving it.
All up on my body while she kissing and hugging it.
Went a Lil lower to the crotch and she was rubbin it.
Rack city chick had me thinking she was sucking it.
Threw a whole stack on her i told her do what You do.
Then she dropped it low she was taking all these girls to school.
Had them other girls jealous cause I'm cooler than a pool.
And the guys they be on looking like a broke fool.
And she was getting it to legit to be quitting it.
Showed me the definition of a real rack city chick.
Booty is a monster body got that perfect thick.
She know how to make a log straight up out a whole stick.
