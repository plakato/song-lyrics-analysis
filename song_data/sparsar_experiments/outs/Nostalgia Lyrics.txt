Nostalgia Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

Vita Et Mors.
18 years went by me in a blink.
I can look at myself today and say I carry no complaints.
If my burial's today I pray my family's staying safe.
Tell my mother that I love her, she place a kiss upon my face.
Just like when I was younger.
Man did I love summer.
Cried every time it ended till my eyes closed shut in slumber.
Or walking outta my bedroom, hearing my sis insult me.
She has that damn quality that makes anything serious paltry.
Or going to my granny's facing chaos and mayhem.
Giving each other shit but knowing where we stand when the day ends.
All my favorite foods cooking, sitting in the oven.
And of course granny always told me the secret ingredient's loving.
In retrospect I object to any of my tantrums cause looking at it today I.
honestly regret nothing.
Using my family and strength, continue to empower.
Facing tomorrow but an eye on the past, yea nostalgia.

Time is another storyteller.
Still have photographs locked in the cellar.
Not to say life is bad now, I'm still copin'.
It just sucks to know that I'm actually growin'.
21 bout' to roll over and die.
22 bout' to come alive, yeah, it's true.
To this very day, you can't fit in my shoes....
Yeah....

Used to drive a red Jeep, liked it when the horn beeped.
Played forever, no sleep.
The boogeyman is under the bed? Nah, he stays creepin'.
Been sidetracked for a while, I been trippin'.
Been slippin' like shoelaces were too long.
All along, been findin' faults with growin' up.
Showin' up, ill humor, I've been flowin' stuck.
Blowin up? Nah, I'm a knowin' fuck.
Not to say I know it all, but I've walked in flames.
People say they relate, it's a different game.
You may be similar, but that don't mean you're the same.
You make a claim, better make sure you make sense.
Motherfuckers these days talk in past tense....
Nostalgia....
Stotle....
