Mindless Lyrics
by Sworn In.

We're all mindless mother fuckers.
Shit....
I'm stuck in my head.
Dead again.
I've lost what's real and what's pretend.
I've lost everything, lost it all.
I left my sanity behind.
Inside the holes in my dry wall.
I've lost everything.
I lost it all.
I've lost my head, I've lost my mind.
It's nothing that i want you to find.
With each passing day I continue to rot.
Trying my best to retain my own thoughts.
I've built my cage and I'm trapped inside it.
Screaming and crying only makes it worse.
I can't associate and I won't even try.
Don't give a fuck if I'm left here to die.
Drag me away but there's no soul to sell.
While you've been calling me I've been in hell.
I've lost my head, I've lost my mind.
It's nothing that i want you to find.
With each passing day I continue to rot.
Trying my best to retain my own thoughts.
All of the thoughts in my head sing to the tune of your death.
Hanging from a fucking rope.
The noose is tied tight.
This is how it ends, right?
One more step and down to hell I go.
One more fucking step and down to hell I go.
Down to hell I go.
What?
I like to think I'm insane and that's not the worst part.
Cause if I've lost my fucking mind I'll surely lose my heart.
Fuck.
I'd be lying if I said I want to be this way but it's a world full of liars.
I'm just playing the game.
