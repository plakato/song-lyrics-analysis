Drank in My Cup Lyrics
by Wordplay.


I done came in, oh fuck. She preggo now, I'm like oh fuck.
Ain't 20 yet and I got a son. My pops don't want no grandson.
That K party was popping though. 300 folks, plus more.
She looking right, leggings on. I put her number in my iPhone.
Do my Dance, Lap Dance. Tyga radio, on me she dance.
Twerking all up on me. She put a nigga in a trance.
Her girlfriends said she got a man. I don't mind being her man.
Clothes burning on the dance floor, and I know for sure she wants more.
Slow dance to Frank Ocean. Her pussy wet like a damn ocean.
End of the party is approaching. She wants the D I'll give her the potion.
Couch, Adams, or Walker Tower. Real fast you know I took her.
To her dorm, baked them buns. Thought this would be a one and done but.

Why the hell did I act so damn stupid? I just wish this was a dream that was.
lucid.
Got to get another job for y'all 2. I fucked up so bad.
But you know what I said, I'll be a good dad.
I had a future now it's gon I can't be mad.
Can't let my son grow up without a father figure.
So I'll be here for both of you and him.
I'm the definition of a fuck up.
