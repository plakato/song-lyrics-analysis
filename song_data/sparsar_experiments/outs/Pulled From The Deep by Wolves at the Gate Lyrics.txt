Pulled From The Deep by Wolves at the Gate Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

Oceans come to pass on the wreckage of all my drowning 
Vessels 
Still. These waters swallow and torment all the men that 
Face their swells 
In this sea of treachery. My heart holds fast to this 
Vessel 
As the waves pass over me. I feel this ship, tremble, 
Breaking and burning and shifting and turning 
I feel this ship fail beneath my feet. 
Somebody save me 
So empty me of this burden in my chest. 
It weighs me down in these darkened waters. 
For. I am Yours, And I know my Redeemer lives 
For. I know my Redeemer lives. 
I have no fear of the dark, for I have the Light inside 
Of me, 
I have been pulled from the depths of the sea. 
If grace were like trickling waters 
We'd be in trouble because we need it like a rushing 
Flood 
But abundant this love still redeems 
Christ became my sin on the cross. 
Stretching out my hands. You reach for my heart, 3x 
Stretching out Your hands. I reach for You. My God 
“God became a man to redeem a sinful humanity and in 
Becoming a man He lived a perfect., Then after He went 
To the cross on that cross. He bore your sin and, as 
Bearing your sin, the Father in heaven crushed His only 
Begotten Son.”, Paul Washer 
Pulled from the deep, a saving grace for wretched, 
Hearts 
Woke from our sleep. Our cries were heard no longer 
Apart 
Stretching out my hands. You reach for my heart, 
Stretching out Your hands. I reach for You, my God, 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
In, this sea of treachery from the depths, my heart sings, 
Hallelujah. What a Savior
