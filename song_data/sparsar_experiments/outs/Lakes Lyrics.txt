Lakes Lyrics
by Wolfgun.

Far away in another dark place.
Is a valley of nothing but fields and lakes.
Lakes full of stars.

Looking up at another night sky.
Through the clouds is nothing but dreams and love.
A sky full of everything bright.

Far away from the opening gates.
Is a mountain of nothing but trees and hope.
Forests filled with starry nights.

Looking up at another night sky.
Through the clouds is a flickering light that waits.
A dim ray of heaven's eyes.

Far away in another dark place.
Is a valley of nothing but fields and lakes.
Lakes full of stars.

Looking down from another night sky.
Through the clouds, now a vision in light will wake.
To a sky of everything bright.

From the water to the hills and vales.
Is a place where the dark conceals a heavenly sky.
Underneath is shimmering light.

Far along on the Milky Way.
Leading down to a place where the sun won't set at night.
And the stars glow perfectly bright.
