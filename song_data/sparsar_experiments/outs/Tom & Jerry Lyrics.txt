Tom & Jerry Lyrics
by NuLOVE.

Let me say some shit right, quick 
Let me talk right, quick., Yo, 
 
Smooveness. Let me hit you with some smoove shit 
Wrote this in a couple of minutes. So let me do this 
Black and white nigga like blues music and cool whip 
Who this dude with no crew acting foolish 
Y'all clueless., Hitting on ya broad, like a Louisville 
Left field homerun, I just dont know who to feel 
Pay. The bills haters still want to keep a gun, concealed 
For, the fun of it. We run it and keep it three hundred mill 
'Til. I make a hundred mill. Imma push the limits, see 
Chillin drinking pina colladas out in the Philippine's 
Who real. As me, Hennessy you, the only ten. I see 
No benefits of living in this city where them niggas be 
Dumping., But they ain't in relationships, 
They, go and fuck. Your sister then make an attempt to take to your bitch 
Take your pic print it on a shirt. Nigga rest in peace, 
Your sister and her fatherless baby gon', read eulogies 
, 
Mike, Wallace 
You. Don'T have that problem. 
 
You get rolled up like windows in the winter 
Im the center of attention trying not to be a sinner, so 
I won't fuck your girl, I'll just take her out to dinner. Nigga 
Who said: Boycott ain't, a winner, 
They'll prolly be the same one scared to say the N-word 
Look at my wrist and see a blizzard 
I'm sippin on some sizzurp girl. Tell me whats for dessert. 
I'M tryna be the one that niggas pay to see 
Cater to your table. With this waitor flow, making cheese 
Smokey the bear would be really pissed cause. We blazing trees. 
Tell me what you know about Pine Street making beats 
4th street writing rhymes. Hope to see some dollar signs 
Yeah, I'm acting out of line balling like I'm out of time 
Oh you thought new school ran 2K-12 
Well heres 2 AK's in your face, nigga Columbine
