Everything Is Possible Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


I got a feeling to hurt, I'm not afraid of turning.
?
Clearly the six is the shift, but does she see as much as me.
Have you ever flew in on a land, the sun not coming down.

Everything is possible.
Singing it like a preacher man.
Everything is possible.
I'll be silent, says the speaking man.

Oh, hold on, oh, hold on x3.

Everything is possible.
Singing it like a preacher Man.
Oh, oh for all who knew.
There's nothing wrong x3.

Everything is possible.
I'll be silent, says the speaking man.
Oh, Oh, of all for the good.
There's nothing wrong, nothing wrong.
Ain't nothing wrong.

? move in on the sand.
There's a guy that you showing us how to survive.
There's an ocean so deep, I'm walking on dry land.
There's a baby and a mother, ?
All the birds through the bush, see how the sound.
Everything is possible, so indescribable.
?
?
Although it take a while, go take your last laugh.
Until I close my wings and I'm back flying.
Sometimes I want to dream, some days I want to leave.
I'm not afraid to hope even though I choked.
?
