Bleed Lyrics
by Vixen.

Why must I be like someone else 
Why can't I just be myself 
If, I should change. Who would it please 
Tell me, the truth is this: all there is 
When I die. Will anybody care 
, 
Ref 
Well, don't tell me how to feel 
Don't. Tell me what's not real 
Cause. I am just me 
And, I'm gon na. Let myself bleed 
So get out of my way, 
I'm gon na. Let myself fear 
Let it live cause. This is my pain. 
This is my pain. 
 
You tell me that I should believe 
These things just take some time 
Well. I believe that you should leave 
You. Just don't understand 
Well it sucks to me. 
I, don't need your condescending sympathy, 
, 
-Refrain-, 
, 
You're, never gon na get inside of my head 
I. Never really cared about the things that you said: 
You're never gon na have a place in my world 
Cause, you don't get it 
You, just don't get it. Oh, no 
, 
-Refrain-
