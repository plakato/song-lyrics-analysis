Juno Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


The troubles that we know are hidden under starlight.
Buried in its glow.
And I've tried to let you know that everything is alright.
Sunken under shadows.

A war between the stars.
A tempest through the years.
But when the dawn had come.
We laid to rest our fears.

I saw the end of days.
And watched the lights arise.
When Titan fell from heaven.
And stood before our eyes.
