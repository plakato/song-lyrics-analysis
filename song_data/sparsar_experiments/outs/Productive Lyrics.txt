Productive Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.


I guess the texts was misinterpretted, now got no choice but work with it.
I light hash and buy quads to bypass the hurt and shit.
Take an eighth for wake and bake, from weight to shake I murdered it.
A better way to waste a day then I ain't ever heard of it.
The Phillie's burning quick,.
better grab caterpie.
When my homie ain't home getting Matt mad at me.
For the sack he handed me.
Gave him 90 in return and burned it with the family.
Bump My Morning Jacket just long enough to pack it.
Attack it, pass it back wit, a white bic to light hits.
Of rapper's delight shit, sounds nice as a tight chick.
I might spit bars and make a song hotter.
Than whats in the bong water then resume the onslaught of.
The slash and burn massacre, blast the herb fast as blurs.
Rastas heard we sit back act absurd.

That's my word.

Now Mary was there for me when no one else was.
With her green lean body and her cute peach fuzz.
That tickles when I kiss her, makes my throat go shaky.
So I haven't even had time for other girls lately.
I keep her laced in linen way we met in the beginning.
But now she's even badder when I have her go swimming.
Or heat her up slow, hit her quick with a whip.
Lay her down in a leaf when I make the center split.
With a chick this fly I got no time for others.
And you can see, by how I don't rhyme for others.
Sometimes brothers sympathize, I don't know why.
I love her, but keep her under cover.
Now a thick chick in a summer dress.
With a set of stunning breasts, would leave me unimpressed, none the less.
She keeps them in my thoughts which ironic, they say that's what she rot.
But I'll never stop, til the trees turn brown.
My organic sweet honey won't be turned down.
