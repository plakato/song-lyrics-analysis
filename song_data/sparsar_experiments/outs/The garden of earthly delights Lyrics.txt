The garden of earthly delights Lyrics
by United States of America.

Poisonous gardens, lethal and sweet.
Venomous blossoms.
Choleric fruit, deadly to eat.
Violet nightshades, innocent bloom.
Omnivourous orchids.
Cautiously wait, hungrily loom.
You will find them in her eyes.
In her eyes, in her eyes.
Petrified willows, twisted and brown.
Carrion swallows.
Wait in the wet darkening room.
Withering shadows, quietly grow.
Potently breeding.
Into a spectacular glow.
You will find them in her eyes.
In her eyes, in her eyes.
Lemonous petals, dissident play.
Tasting of ergot.
Dancing by night, dying by day.
Blackening mushrooms drink in the rain.
Sinister nightblooms.
Wilt with the dawn's welcoming pain.
You will find them in her eyes.
In her eyes, in her eyes.
