Lycanthrope Lyrics
by +44.

I wake up at the end of a long, dark, lonely year.
It's bringing out the worst in me.
I hear your voice start breaking in fear.
When the lights go down.

And I still feel you looking over my shoulder.
Your sinking guilt and approaching nightmare.
And I know none of us will survive.
Because I know everything.

Alright.

And my dear I need you to move a little faster.
This second counts as the rest of your life.
Your final word and an itchy finger.
And then it's taken away.

And we'll be beaten down without mercy or meaning.
I turn my face to a careless skyline.
I'm searching hard for a sign from heaven.
But they've forgotten me here.

And you can just stop talking, I get it.

I know it's barely a thought but it'll see us through.
I'm only setting you free so just let it happen.

Yeah you can just stop talking, I get it.

Sex, fuck, and fluorescent lighting.
A hollow point on an angry bullet.
We're on the teeth of a crocodile.
We're in the mouth of the gun.

And sometimes at night I feel I'm just a broken vessel.
An instrument with a darker purpose.
I'm at the throat of the young and the helpless.
Cause they've got nothing to say.

Yeah.
