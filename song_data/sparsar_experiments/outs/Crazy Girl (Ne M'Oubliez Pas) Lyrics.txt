Crazy Girl (Ne M'Oubliez Pas) Lyrics
by Ruse.

I was trashed in the underground.
You were alone.
It was fast, you were dirty then.
You took me home.
Through the back door.
You pulled me downstairs.
You took it all off, then you disappeared.

Now the taste of you is.
Burned into my head.
And now I'm turned around.
I never left your bed.

On a lonely night.
With a crazy girl.
Did he feel alright?
When you killed the world.

I'm waiting, I'm watching walls.
What did I hear?
Am I just paranoid?
Could it be all that I fear?
I climb upstairs, slide open the door.
Who is that in you while you beg for more.

Now that sight of you is.
Burned into my head.
Through the window.
Guess I'm going home instead.

On a lonely night.
With a crazy girl.
Did he feel alright?
When you killed the world.

The end is here but I'll be alright.
The end is here but I'll be alright.

The end is here but I'll be alright.
The end is here but I'll be alright.

The end is here but I'll be alright.
The end is here but I'll be alright.

On a lonely night.
With a crazy girl.
Did he feel alright?
When you killed the world.

On a lonely night.
With a crazy girl.
Did he feel alright?
When you killed the world.
