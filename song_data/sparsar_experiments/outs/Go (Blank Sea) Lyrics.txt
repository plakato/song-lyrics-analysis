Go (Blank Sea) Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.

What does it give you when you're awake.
Does it give better than it takes.
What does it give you when you're awake.
Does it give better than it takes.
Does it know the truth in you.
Does it know the truth in you.

And I go down town.
Where they don't know my name.
And I go down town.
Where they don't know my name.

Who can afford an honest answer.
With all these lies we're living in.
And who can give me what i'm after.
In this cold saturation.
But i'm not lost.

And I go down town.
Where they don't know my name.
And I go down town.
Where they don't know my name.

And i said no one.
And i said no one can stop me now.
And i said no one.
And i said no one can stop me now.

And I go down town.
Where they don't know my name.
And I go down town.
Where they don't know my name.

And I go down town.
Where they don't know my name.
And I go down town.
Where they don't know my name.
