Out For The Sun Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

We set out for the sun, we set out for the sun.
Why do I care? Why can't I rest? My head on a shoulder till I'm dead.
Why does it matter? Why can't I stick around until he's gone?
Why do I wait around for this one? Why do I wait around for this one?
We set out for the sun, we set out for the sun.
Give me the protection, give me peace, just give me something that I nee.
Why does it matter? Why can't I stick around until we're free?
Why do I wait around for this dream? Why do I wait around for this one?
We set out, we set out for the sun.

We set out for the sun, we set out for the sun.
Why do I care? Why can't I rest? My head on a shoulder till I'm dead.
Why does it matter? Why can't I stick around until he's gone?
Why do I wait around for this one? Why do I wait around for this one?
We set out for the sun, we set out for the sun.
Give me the protection, give me peace, just give me something that I nee.
Why does it matter? Why can't I stick around until we're free?
Why do I wait around for this dream? Why do I wait around for this one?
We set out, we set out for the sun.
