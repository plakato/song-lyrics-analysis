More Than A Feeling Lyrics
by Boston.


I looked out this morning and the sun was gone.
Turned on some music to start my day.
I lost myself in a familiar song.
I closed my eyes and I slipped away.

It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play.
I begin dreaming.
'Till I see Marianne walk away.
I see my Marianne walkin' away.

So many people have come and gone.
Their faces fade as the years go by.
Yet I still recall as I wander on.
As clear as the sun in the summer sky.

When I'm tired and thinking cold.
I hide in my music, forget the day.
And dream of a girl I used to know.
I closed my eyes and she slipped away.
She slipped away.
