Stand Still Lyrics
by Visionaries.


At, a standstill, frozen 
Posin' for a portrait, framed with guidance 
Three-pronged like a trident 
Try it in a'port report the second hand, smoke 
Rumors, are contagious. 
Some of the things heard are truly outrageous. 
Age put the rage in us who's. This pagin' us 
Uphold maintenance to avoid rust, 
Simplify, competitive complexities, 
I beg for forgiveness. Please 
We share to uplift this round square 
We're, not one beat the drum without a care 
Don't. You dare chat to me in that manner. 
Different territory, different type of grammar, 
Bond, family. No relationship to Bammer 
Number, one mover and shaker of a tackle 
You're uneven. You need more spackle 
Bitin', like a jackal snap, crackle and pop 
Slung herbs to this cop. Didn'T do it a lot 
Once! It'S off the lot! It depreciates 
Motor mile stop revvin for the pedestrians 
State. Your full name answer questions 
Take all this as suggestions. 
 
Days are limited 
Look at life. How you're livin' it 
Got the solution apply. 
Worthless information lie: 
 
Why, fear, Armageddon, 
When, there's eternal life in heaven, 
Get that overhaul get the engine revvin 
Play the wall at the Gavin convention, 
Dead-end your ego like vehicle 
People, it's repairable, plus fareable 
Elementals terrible 
The only way, they'll get five mics from the Source. 
Is a t-shirt be hurt, 
Inadvertenly, dominary, 
Whenever, there's a turntable I'ma be heard: 
Preferred, Visionary, wha-wha-wha-wha, 
Got your attention, like TV 
I, place no value on shock rock for you to see 
Check the policy. Honesty is a rarity. 
Include me in a theory 
Clearly not overnight. I man 
Excellent a walk in the park. Cali accent, 
There's, always room for improvement, 
Done it before they do it 
Do it bits and pieces. 
All releases increases, 
Canadian currency, 
Currently, a blessed MC
