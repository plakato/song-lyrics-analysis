Shy Girl Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Saturday mornin, shake off the sheets and open my eyes.
Baby, do you know what's going on tonight?
I miss someone maybe she's not a crazy girl like you.
But let me tell you baby, she's gonna do.

No hesitatin, there's gonna be a picture showin now.
And maybe if she's lucky dinner on the side.
Well girl I said I loved you.
Well I wrote you a song, played it many times.
With so many rhymes, what did you do?

Girl, I've been waiting for oh so long.
I'd like to see him write you a song, you're my.

Shy girl she's the only thing that keeps my mind.
From wondering every time I'm thinkin bout you.
Shy girl, it's not that I don't mind the silence every time.
It's just not you.

Your friends are careful, I try to read the look in their eyes.
Like there all saying, 'Man, I feel bad for this guy'.
Maybe it's paranoia, it's all in my head I say to myself.
Or maybe it's in my heart sitting on the shelf.

Girl I can say I don't need you.
But I know in my heart it's not true.

Girl I can say I don't need you.
But I know in my heart it's just not true.
