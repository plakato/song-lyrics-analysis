Friday Night Lyrics
by XO-IQ.

I can't wait for the weekend.
Hanging out with my girlfriends.
Doing things that we wanna do oo oo.

Make-up on – pick the right dress.
Do our hair – like supermodels.
Have some fun and just forget about school, no rules.

Get the party started, you know what to do.
Everyone's invited, you can come too – yes you can come too.

Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Let's do it again - do do do do it again.

Flashing lights shine at our show.
People moving on the dance-floor.
Music takes you where you wanna go, oh oh.

Don't stop dancing can you feel it.
The beat is pumping gotta use it.
It's now or never everyone come on, come on.

Get the party started.
You know what to do.
Everyone`s invited.
You can come too – I know you want to.

Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Let's do it again - do, do do do it again.

I can't wait for the weekend.
I can't wait for the weekend.
Ooooh.
Yeah yeah.
Oh yeah.
Do it again, do do do do it again …

Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Friday night it feels alright, let's do it again.
Let's do it again - do, do do do it again.
Do it again.
Do it again.
Do it again.
Do it again.
