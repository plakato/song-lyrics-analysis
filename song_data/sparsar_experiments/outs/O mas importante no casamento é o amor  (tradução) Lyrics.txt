O mas importante no casamento é o amor  (tradução) Lyrics

Music: The marriage is important but love.

The important but marriage is love.
Purico I can not marry without love.
Happiness begins at the exact moment when we find someone.
What in the value.

In a relationship it is important not to have the agent wants to pound.
But yeah have the agent needs to pound.
Love the mason who is a precise.
To prove that you love someone you do not need to sign terms.
Of responsibility in the conservatory.
You just need to make you happy girl.
You do not need you swear that you love her before the house of god.
Marriage is not synonymous with happiness, nor proof that love exists.
Because love is only love when she lives the basis of sincerity.
And trust within a relationship without pain.
Love is union of positive feelings.
Whoever loves is always a good friend.
Say what you what good you have what you want.
At the wedding itself within this heart has no love.
Promises do not reflect the future on love beautiful.

The important but marriage is love.
Purico I can not marry without love.
Happiness begins at the exact moment when we find someone.
What in the value.
