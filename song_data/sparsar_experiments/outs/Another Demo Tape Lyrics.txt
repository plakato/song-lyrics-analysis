Another Demo Tape Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Madlib.
Everywhere I go I always end up with a pocket full CD demo tapes after clubs.
at my shows even though I sit back and listen to em with an open mind I find.
that not even one of them I can press rewind.

Even niggas in limos passin' out they demos, claimin' that they shits like.
mine, so we do the 6 demo test and roll it out by the time we pass the third.
song we throw it out.

Time and time again I hear the same story.

But when I pop it in me and Dilla just laugh do the math.
