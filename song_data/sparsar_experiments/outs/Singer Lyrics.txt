Singer Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.


My mirror remember
The folds in our feathers
The line and the measure
Of, the wings of
Of, the sender

And. All of this has
Passed between us
To crack it open
And release. Us

Youth was black and blue
But. I'M a singer
And time is braided bands
But. I would give you rings for every finger
And ribbons for your hair

And do surrender
My darkest endeavours
The fire and the embers
My mirror remembers

That. All of this has
Passed between us
To crack. It open
And release us

You catch it when you can
Like silver in your hair
