Adam & Noah's Priorities (Interlude) Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.

ADAM.
I think the priorities have never changed - something we've all dreamed about.
doing since we were little kids, and it's, uh, it's a big step in the right.
direction for our careers now that we're here, drinking beer at 11 AM,.
laughing in the background.

NOAH.
No, come on dude!

ADAM.
He just cares about beer!
