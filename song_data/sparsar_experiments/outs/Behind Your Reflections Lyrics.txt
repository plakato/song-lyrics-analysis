Behind Your Reflections Lyrics
by Voice.

Your last day gives away it's light.
On the long way to the darkness.
And the night comes down on us.
With a hopeless scream.
Awakes once more your feelings.
About then to sink into a dream.

Believe in your power.
And don't you look back.
Follow this shining way.
Never surrender.
And raise your head.
Till the last day, the very last day.

Think of your best times.
Look up to the sky.
Follow the rising sun.
And never say die.

The pictures of your life.
Are passing through your mind.
All sorrows become void and small.
Now many hours have you senselessly wasted.
And now ask yourself the question.
What that all?

Don't throw away your life.
You are not alone.
Suicide never was your way.
Don't give up.
And raise your head.
Till the last day, the very last day.

Think of your best times....
