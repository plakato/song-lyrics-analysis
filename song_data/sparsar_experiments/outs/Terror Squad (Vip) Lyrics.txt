Terror Squad (Vip) Lyrics
by Zomboy.

Dance everyone dance!

Come on dance!

Little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit.

Go in for a little bit.
And make him think you're feeling him.
And smile.
And let him wake your ass.
And make him think he's in it.
Turn it on.
Turn it on.
Turn it on.
Turn it on.
Turn it on.
On.
On.
On.
It's fucking Zomboy.

Get out of my face!

Dance everyone dance!

Come on dance!

Little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit.

Go in for a little bit.
And make him think you're feeling him.
And smile.
And let him wake your ass.
And make him think he's in it.
Turn it on x5.
On x3.
It's fucking Zombo....

Get out of my face!
