Dats Whassup Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

I represent New Bedford, MA.
This right here will rock all across the globe.
From 718 to 818.
I want one.
I'ma get straight stupid.
Watch, watch me do dis.

Cause I'm in the mood to get so crazy.
We can wild out.
I don't care, baby.
Do what you like cause it's all open.
This is the jump off right here, baby.

So yeah, baby.
Dats wassup.
I'ma keep this muthafucka lit up.
Don't you even trip.
I'm here and I'm all dressed up.
But if your girl wanna talk shit.
I'll take off my shit.
And be back up in this bitch like wat.

Naw, naw.
We don't even slip.
Whatever hood you with.
Hit the dance floor and throw it up.
So go head and take a hit and a sip.
Throw it back a skip.
And throw it back to dis.

I represent New Bedford, MA.
To tilt Midwest to South Beach to Florida.
You know you keep it moving.
Looking how we do it like.
I'm a get straight stupid.
Watch while I do dis.

Cause I'm in the mood to get so crazy.
We can wild out.
I don't care, baby.
Do what you like cause it's all open.
This is the jump off right here, baby.

So yeah, baby.
Dats wassup.
I'ma keep this muthafucka lit up.
Don't you even trip.
I'm here and I'm all dressed up.
But if your girl wanna talk shit.
I'll take off my shit.
And be back up in this bitch like wat.

Naw, naw.
We don't even slip.
Whatever hood you with.
Hit the dance floor and throw it up.
So go head and take a hit and a sip.
Throw it back a skip.
And throw it back to dis.

Can't fuck with dis.
It's TK shit.
You can't handle this.
Up in this bitch it's TK shit now.
Skip to dis.

I'm only gonna tell you one more time.
Before your ass hits the primetime.
That's right.
There's a matter when I cross the line.
Oh, his ass hits the floor a time.

Dats wassup.
Dats wassup.
Dats wassup.
Dats wassup.

So yeah, baby.
Dats wassup.
I'ma keep this muthafucka lit up.
Don't you even trip.
I'm here and I'm all dressed up.
But if your girl wanna talk shit.
I'll take off my shit.
And be back up in this bitch like wat.

Naw, naw.
We don't even slip.
Whatever hood you with.
Hit the dance floor and throw it up.
So go head and take a hit and a sip.
Throw it back a skip.
And throw it back to dis.
