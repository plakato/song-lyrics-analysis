4th Of July Lyrics
by Sweet.

The floor got up and hit my face.
I couldn't make it to the door.
I took a sip and drained the tap.
And life became a finger snap.
Aha.

I couldn't understand it.
My days were in a daze.
Is it bloody Sunday.
I'd better say my prayers.
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

And when the stars came down.
I was higher than the 4th of July.
Blitzin' right across the sky.
High, high, higher.

Believe the lies I told myself.
I wasn't into self denial.
No way.
I held my breath I count to ten.
So turn around round round.
And do it again.

I couldn't understand it.
My life was all a blaze.
Is it bloody Sunday.
My days were in a daze.

When the stars came down.
I was higher than the 4th of July.
Blitzin' right across the sky.
High, high, higher.

And when the stars fell down.
You know I' m gonna burn up the town.
It's the 4th of July.
And I was getting so high.

When the stars came down.
I was higher than the 4th of July.
Pitchin' right across the sky.
High, high, higher.
