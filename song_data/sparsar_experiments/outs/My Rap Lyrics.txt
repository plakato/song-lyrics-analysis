My Rap Lyrics
by Tyler.

I made my own rap song here it is When I get up in the morning I start.
snapping my fingers to the beat of the music then I jump up and start dancing.
like a fool with no rhythm I got no time to shine like a diamond in the sky.
and then when it's morning I see people walking down the street like there.
about to cause some caous in the streets of the crowded town where there about.
to take over the town to turn it around but when they do they hear the sound.
of sirens in the not so distant past and then they stopped and shouted let's.
get out of this damn town please tell me what you think !
