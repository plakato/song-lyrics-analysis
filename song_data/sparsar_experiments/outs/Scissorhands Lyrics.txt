Scissorhands Lyrics
by The Uncluded.

Aesop Rock, Kimya Dawson.
There are days when I.
couldn't fight my way out of a wet paper bag.
Even if I had Edward.
Scissorhands hands.
There are times I kick and scream and cry.
Because I'm swept up in a hurricane.
Of shit that hard to leave behind.
This snowballs chances are fantastic.
With elemental firm my past hell bent on escalating fast.
There are days when I couldn't fight my way out of a wet paper bag.
Even if I had Edward Scissorhands hands.

If I had Edward Scissorhands hands.
I would whittle pogs into pentagrams.
Like say hello to my little friends.
Give me ten snip snip.
Harvester of middle men.

In a moment of resenting he's motivated of forgetting.
Home.
A den of grotesque over stepping.
Where blood ain't thick as a face full of spit.
From a eucharistic minister enraged with his kid.
The very same hand feeding Christ to parishioners.
Later bunched tight.
Punched lights out his miniatures.
And images I don't associate with my awareness anymore.
But I've recently been daring to explore.
Instead of bury.
Schlep home juggle the wet stones.
The handshakes sting.
But the hug is a death code.
The son of a spitfire.
Show up in the wet snow.
He's cutting the tripwire.
He's opened a window.
Like a mercenary gunning for a slumbering death stroke.
In the penultimate seconds of a budding crescendo.
These stone snows.
Scissorhands bets.
Cut a pig heart from a wicked mans chest.
Maybe hang it high on a fence for a fantasy alive in the eyes of revenge.
Oh.
And accidentally injure every jam band.
If I had Edward Scissorhands hands.
Hmm...

I will wrap my arms around you.
And I will not let them get through to harm you.
My fingers will be just like barbed wire surrounding you.
And I will not let them through.
To do the things they want to do to you.
I will wrap my arms around you.
I will wrap my arms around you.

Aesop Rock, Kimya Dawson.
There are days when I couldn't fight my way out of a wet paper bag.
Even if I had Edward Scissorhands hands.
There are times I kick and scream and cry.
Because I'm swept up in a hurricane.
Of shit that hard to leave behind.
This snowballs chances are fantastic.
With elemental firm my past hell bent on escalating fast.
There are days when I couldn't fight my way out of a wet paper bag.
Even if I had Edward Scissorhands hands.

If I had Edward Scissorhands hands.
If I had Edward Scissorhands hands.
