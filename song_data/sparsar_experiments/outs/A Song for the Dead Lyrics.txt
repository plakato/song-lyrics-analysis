A Song for the Dead Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


It's late enough to go driving.
And see what's mine.
Life's the study of dying.
How to do it right.
You're a holy roller.
If you bet in the loose.
If you're hanging around.
I'm holding the noose.
Come a little bit closer.
And get untied.
In a hearse rolling over.
Just a track in the line.
Fuck it.

Come on, let's go driving.
Come on, let's take a little ride.
That's the study of dying.
How to do it right.
