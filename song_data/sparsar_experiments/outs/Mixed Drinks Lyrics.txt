Mixed Drinks Lyrics
by Sydney.

Oh baby don't you break now, in this town.
It's only 24 hours till I'm out.
And I'm down on the ground on the way to your doorstep.
Well if your down then I'm down.
We're gonna tear shit up in this town.
It's a shame that the plane were I'm caged doesn't go any faster.

You've got the chance it's in your eyes.
I see it, I see it.
You've got the chance to make this right.
I need it, I need it.

You've got the suicide smile and a look in your eyes that says you were on.
fire.
And I'm burning up inside.
If you were a lie I'd believe you in no time.
Maybe were crazy but all we know.

Baby you were on fire, you desire.
You're every word that means lust.
I can't lie you're just like the pill that I take to make everything heartless.
And you've got the chance it's in your eyes.
I see it, I see it.

Well if you're down then I'm down.
We're gonna tear shit up in this town.
It's a shame that the plane were I'm caged doesn't go any faster.

You've got the chance it's in your eyes.
I see it, I see it.
You've got the chance to make this right.
I need it I need it.
And I think you should know.

You've got the suicide smile and a look in your eyes that says you were on.
fire.
And I'm burning up inside.
If you were a lie I'd believe you in no time.
Maybe were crazy but all we know x2.

Don't say it. I'm desperately waiting.
Don't say it. I'm desperately waiting.

It's okay you're afraid of the way everyone wants to befriend you.
It's the same and it constantly haunts me.
Cause it's not for sale, you wanna count backwards from ten x3.

You've got the suicide smile and a look in your eyes that says you are on fire.
And I'm burning up inside.
If you were a lie I'd believe you in no time.
Maybe were crazy.
You've got the suicide smile and a look in your eyes that says you are on fire.
And I'm burning up inside.
If you were a lie I'd believe you in no time.
Maybe were crazy but all we know.
