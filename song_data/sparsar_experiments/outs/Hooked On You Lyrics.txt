Hooked On You Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Ooh ooh ooh 
Whoa 
Ooh ooh, ooh, 
Whoa, whoa, 
, 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 
Whoa, 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
You're, sexy real 
 
I can't explain what I'm going through 
Wish. I could find the right words to say: 
Losing control, 
And, it's over you 
Nobody else can make me feel this way. 
 
Could it just be that I'm curious 
And. I wan na make you play my game 
But. Something tells me that it's serious 
Because I go insane 
When. I hear your name 
 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 

What. Can I do 
It's over you? 
 
I try to hide it 
But. I know it's true 
My body trembles. When I look in your eyes, 
I'm so turned on 
I, don't know what to do. 
It seems your touch can make my temperature rise. 
 
Can. It just be that I'm curious 
And I wan na make you play my game 
But. Something tells me that it's serious 
Because I go insane 
When. I hear your name 
 
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, 
 
What. Can I do 
It's over you 
 
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, 
, 
That's cool 
Th-th-th-that's, cool 
Ho, 
Sexy 
Ho, 
Sexy, 
, 
I'm, 
I'm, 
I'm, 
I'm, 
I'm, 
I'm, 
I'm, 
I'm, 
 
What. Can I do 
It's over you? 
 
When days grow long and nights grow. Cold. 
You are the one I need to hold 
I'm taken by your sexy ways. 
Trapped inside this lover's maze 
I wanted you right from the start. 
 
Why. Can'T you see 
You stole my heart, 
Just loving! You can set me free 

Oh. Can'T you see 
 
Hearts on fire, 
Higher 
Higher 
Nobody else can make me feel the way that you do 
 
Could it be that this time 
Love has taken all control 
You're, the one whose touch I need 
The one. I need to hold 
Could it be that this time 
Love has taken all control, 
, 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 

The one I need to hold 
What. Can I do 
It's over you
