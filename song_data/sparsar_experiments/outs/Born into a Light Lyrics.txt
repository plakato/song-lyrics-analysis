Born into a Light Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

For everything that's wrong.
There is a worried man.
There is a reason why.
We just don't understand but will....
You got to keep the faith.

Be patient, oh the past.
Is just a memory, and heal.
Heal your vines, you'll heal inside eventually.

We were born into a light.
We were born of light.
We were born into a light.

For everyone alone I wish you faith and hope.
And all the strength to cope.
To be your own best friend.
Have confidence and keep the faith.

Be patient, oh the past.
Is just a memory, and heal.
Heal your vines, you'll heal inside eventually.

We were born into a light.
We were born into a light.
We were born of light.
We were born into a light.

The Lights.
The Lights.
The Lights.
Not the Lights.
