GIRLS / THE LIFE / PLEASE.

Girls.

Stay up for the night baby.
There's a guy in the club looking for the right lady.
You don't wanna disappoint the crew.
No you don't even care cus' you're just doing you and you're.
All so hungry!
I said you're hungry! That's that.
Lust all night, blow the dust off the light.
Make sure they've got view.
Like who wouldn't wanna be you.
Attentions on the menu for tonight girls!
And you gonna get it, oh you gon get it.
And you're gonna love it, And you'll have seconds.
It's your confidence, for you it makes sense.
But to the rest of the world.

Its just a bunch of little girls all up in the club.
Thinking they the shit and shit.
Why they think they so different.
You're in your zone.
Please baby girl leave me alone.
I can't deal with you hoe ass hoes.
Go dance and get gone get gone now.

Get gone get gone now.
Get gone get gone.
You think you bout it.
Get all up out it.
Make up, fake up get down for whatever.
You saw it on tv you wouldn't know better.
Girls.

The Life.

Same club on the weekend and you love it.
You love it, You love it.
You show up with your friends in the front like its nothing.
Fronting like its nothing.
I could see it coming.
Thinking you the shit you and the girls get the tongue in.
And that was just a Sunday.
But you a good girl on a Monday.
Ain't  that funny.
Make  that money.
You think  you're something.
Thirsty girls keep running off.
You're not gonna wanna go back to the party if you come over.
Here, dont come over here.
Cuz you won't wanna go back to the party if you come over here.
Let me whisper in your ear say.
We bout it, so if you not bout then get up out it.
If your man comes up in here when your in here things gon get rowdayyy.
Things'll get rowdayy, Things'll get rowdayy.

Please.

Please, please don't be like them.
Do you a favor don't go in.
With your girls.
For the world.
To bow at your knees.
Oh you.
Store up hate in me.
I sit so silently.
I beg you, just be you could you.
Do that for me?
Could you do that for you?
It hurts baby.
It hurts baby.
It burns baby.
You gotta heal the pain.
