Lights in the sky Lyrics
by Woodrowgerber.

Lights In The Sky.

The airs electric tonight in town.
Sometimes I forget that I'll be ok.
The moon is crashing and its got me down.
But we're together so we'll be ok.

Everyone dances as their worlds collide.
The solders come home to a great parade.
Outcasts and liars fight over crumbs.
Give me your hand and we'll drift away.

Lights in the sky.
Better come with me.
Time has arrived.
To wake your dreams.

Lets go to Rome and watch the fires burn.
The sun is rising on a perfect day.
Crooks and thieves will come for us now.
Give me your hand and we will drift away.

Lights in the sky.
Better come with me.
Time has arrived.
To wake your dreams.
