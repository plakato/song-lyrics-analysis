My Soul To Take Lyrics
by Xodiak.

I'm gone, follow the river.
Follow the river, better streams.
I'm gone, flowing out.
Follow the river.

I've thrown my heart into the wolves.
My pride inside the dungeon.
My life given to you.
My love given to you.
Set fire to the fuel.
I'm more than what you bargained.
It's what you wanted.

You came for me.
You heard my cry.
You're made for me.
You're one of a kind.
I see the moon in your eyes lit.
Underneath the thunder in the sky.
Thunder in my mind.
I've seen so many disguises.
Who knew loving you would be a crime?
A crime.

Who's gonna save my soul now?
How can I have it my way?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna take me away?
Don't let me drown.

Love me.
Until the end of our time.
You've been one to believe.
Well, love what if I?
I see the moon in your eyes lit.
Underneath the thunder in the sky.
Thunder in my mind.
I've seen so many disguises.
Who knew loving you would be a crime?
A crime.

Who's gonna save my soul now?
How can I have it my way?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna take me away?
Don't let me drown.

Follow me.
I've got a place to show you.
Come and see.
Are you afraid to go through?
Keep with me babe we won't fall.
Asleep into the reapers arms.

Who's gonna save my soul now?
