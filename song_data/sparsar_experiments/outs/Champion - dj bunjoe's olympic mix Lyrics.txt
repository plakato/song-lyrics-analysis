Champion - dj bunjoe's olympic mix Lyrics
by RuPaul.

One dream, the will to fight.
And all we can do is laugh.
This time, you got it right.
And no one can take it back.
They tried to keep you down.
But there's no denying you're a.
Champion, greatest of them all.
You're a champion, never gonna fall.
You're a champion, still standing tall.
You're a champion, and you'll always be a hero.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh.
Nobody wins by playing small.
Remember who you really are.
Fearless and beautiful.
A child of a shinin' star.
They tried to keep you down.
But there's no denying you're a.
Champion, greatest of them all.
You're a champion, never gonna fall.
You're a champion, still standing tall.
You're a champion, and you'll always be a hero.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh.
And when your stories told and the truth unfolds.
They will sing your praises loud.
Cause your stories gold, if the truth be told.
With all the children singing.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-ohhh.
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh.
You're a champion, greatest of them all.
You're a champion, never gonna fall.
You're a champion, still standing tall.
You're a champion, and you'll always be a hero.
You're a champion, greatest of them all.
You're a champion, never gonna fall.
You're a champion, still standing tall.
You're a champion, and you'll always be a hero.
You a champion.
You a champion.
You a champion.
You're a champion and you'll always be a hero.
