Birds Lyrics
by Wrathschild.


Where my arms are would be two wings 
If. I had my way with these 
I'd never fly. Instead, I'd sing to the wind 
My heart would never break again 
Cause. My lover is the sky 
And, I'm on adrenaline living high. Until I die 
 
If, we were birds, we wouldn't have to stay 
Flip a bitch and fly away 
Shit on the heads who say that we can't dream 
If. We were birds, we could do anything 
, 
Drop 
If we were bir-, 
 
I would burn up all the cash 
Like, a phoenix turn to ash 
Make it rain from the heavens 
Cause I'm king in the present 
And. The future is my digress. 
 
Baby, I'm a raptor, get ready for the rapture 
Flying like a fire at the end of the earth. 
I'D fly over disaster, no happy ever after 
Nothing left, but me and the birds 
 
Birds birds, 
If. We were birds, birds, 
Bir-bir-bir-bir-birds, birds, 
If. We were birds, birds, birds, 
Fly, away, fly away, 
Fly, ai-yu-ai-yu-ai-yu, 
,
