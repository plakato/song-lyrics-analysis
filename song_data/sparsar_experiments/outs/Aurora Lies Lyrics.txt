Aurora Lies Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Leaving the suburbs for nights on the fringe.
We shovel the snow just to give us the edge.
Selling our bodies to unmarked cars.
This Motor City can make us a star.
Tell me what you want from me.
Show me that the best of days.
Won't end up behind me.
I'm inching closer further south.
Oil lamps are pouring out.
A third wave, look out.
Hold on.
Is this love on the run?
Is our love on the run?
