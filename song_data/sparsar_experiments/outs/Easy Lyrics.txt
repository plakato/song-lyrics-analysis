Easy Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

Tell me when it's over.
I will begin pulling the boards from my front door once it is safer then.
I'll show my face again.

Yeah I want you closer.
I've been livin', just like a ghost for the most part I'm feeling dissonant.
And you're indifferent.

But, you're still not sure.
Yeah you're still not sure.
Let me make it easier.

You don't have to call.
You don't have to say, I love you again.
If you want a love that's easy.
Then I would rather have nothing.

Maybe when we're older it'll sink in.
Cause heaven knows this ain't blowin' over anytime too fast.
But everything will pass.

Yeah I'm getting bolder with my thinking.
You've got me wrong for so long I can't even turn my back.
Without you falling off track.

But you're still not sure.
I know you're still not sure.
So let me make it easier.

You don't have to call.
You don't have to say, I love you again.
If you want a love that's easy.
Then I would rather have nothing.

Never been so clear as now.

So if you're still not sure.
If you're still not sure.
Let me make it easier.
