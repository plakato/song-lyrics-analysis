The Day I Found God Lyrics
by Switchfoot.

The morning comes like an enemy soldier.
I feel the weight across my shoulders.
I feel the shadows getting colder.
But that ain't you.

This noose ain't getting any looser.
I get so fearful about the future.
I hear the shame of my accuser.
But that ain't you.

I found strength but it wasn't what I thought.
I found peace in the places I forgot.
I found riches ain't the things that I had bought.
I found out.
The day I lost myself was the day that I found God.

I get caught chasing my own illusions.
I get so lost in these confusions.
I keep on looking for my own solutions.
But that ain't you, that ain't you no.

My enemies weren't the ones I had fought.
My liberties weren't the freedoms I had sought.
What I learned weren't the lessons I'd been taught.
I found out the day I lost myself was.
The day that I found God.

Where is God out in the darkness?
Cause the voices in my head ain't talking honest.
They're saying maybe you made us then forgot us.
But that ain't you, that ain't you no.

And all I know is that I still don't know a lot.
I don't know how it ends I'm in the middle of this plot.
Yeah and I found grace for the man that I am not.
Yeah, I found out the day I lost myself.
Yeah, I found out.

The day I lost myself was the day that I found God.
