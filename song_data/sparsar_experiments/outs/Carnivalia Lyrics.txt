Carnivalia Lyrics
by Viza.

Quit your complaining, so what if its raining, everyone there is tongue tied.
Summon the baritones, levy the Capricorns, ready or not we're nearby.

Carnivalia its the strangest show on earth.
Carnivalia who is your master?
Carnivalia for all you boys and girls.
Carnivalia can we go any faster?

Sculptures and paintings, superstitiously fainting, please let the midget.
squeeze by.
Summon the baritones, levy the capricorns, ready or not we're nearby.

Can we go any faster?
Can we go any faster?

Opium rugs.
Satin bed bugs.
Your perfume puts me right to sleep.
Laugh if you will.
Cry for the thrill as the spotlight falls on you and on me.

Opium rugs.
Satin bed bugs.
Your perfume puts me right to sleep.
Laugh if you will.
Cry for the thrill as the spotlight falls on you and on me.
