In These Arms Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Use the truth as a weapon.
To beat up all your friends.
Every chink in the armour.
An excuse to cause offence.
And the boys from the hallways.
Calling out your name.
And true love will find them in the end.

You were restless.
I was somewhere less secure.
So I went running to the road.
And so now there's.
A long list of places I was.
I quit my rambling and I came home.

Cause maybe I was born to hold you in these arms.
Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms.

Use your saints.
And your mantra.
And your things to keep you calm.
If you stay with that asshole.
He's gonna do you harm.
There's a voice singing loudly on the radio.
Just for you.
And good fortune will find him in the end.

Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms.
Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms.
Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms.
Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms.
