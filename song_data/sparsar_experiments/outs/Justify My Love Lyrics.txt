Justify My Love Lyrics
by Vita.

Vita w/ Ashanti harmonizing.
I wanna kiss you in Paris...
I wanna hold your hands in Rome...
I wanna run like a rainstorm...
Make love on the train, cross-country...
You put this in me, so now what?
So now what?...

Wantin.. needin...
Waitin.. for you, to justify my love...
Hopin.. prayin.. for you, to justify my love...

I wanna know you.. not like that...
I don't wanna be your mother...
And I don't wanna be your sister either...
I just wanna be your lover...
I wanna be your baby...
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me, me.

Wantin.. needin...
Waitin.. for you, to justify my love...
Yearnin.. burnin.. for you, to justify my love...

What are you gonna do.. talk to me...
Tell me your dreams, am I in them?...
Tell me your fears, are you scared?...
Tell me your storys.. I'm not afraid of who you are...
Make you fly...

Pour us Demeir, the pleasure's depend.
On the permission of another.
Love me, that's right, love me...

I wanna be your baby...
Wantin.. needin...
Waitin.. for you, to justify my love...
I'm open.. I'm ready.. for you, to justify my love...

I'm waitin.. to justify...
Wantin.. to justify my love...
Waitin.. to justify...

I'm open...

{*music stops*} {*music starts then fades*}.
