Embrace Lyrics
by Wolverine.

You changed all that I am.
Once you opened your eyes.
Right there I turned off the world.
And then there were you and I.
Whole again, you have defined who I am.
Innocence helps me retain what I am.
One breath was all they required.
To deprive us all of our bliss.
Right there I saw you were lost.
And there wouldn't be another “us”.
I fell and I fell, into a dark and bottomless pit.
Darkness embraced my whole world.
I'll trade you my life, spare you my heart.
Without you I still would be lost, I'd drown in an ocean.
I am you, you are me, we cannot part.
A future's embrace clad with hope is ours…
Slowly dark clouds dispersed.
Offered a passage of life.
And they gave us a reason to carry on.
What we believed wouldn't be suddenly was.
I'll trade you my life, spare you my heart.
Without you I still would be lost, I'd drown in an ocean.
I am you, you are me, we cannot part.
A future's embrace clad with hope is ours…
Dark clouds will shadow the roads we'll be walking.
And questions will challenge our minds and our hopes.
But I'm sure that devotion and faith will make darkness subside.
For the power of love is embodied and born in our strong embrace…
