Evacuate the vacuous Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

Something warm would be something nice.
To keep me from moaning in the morning.
And morning through the night.
Alright.

Take your things from my house.
Evacuate my life.
It's all your reason.

Oh oh.
Uh oh.

And everything's okay.
In its own little way.

And everything's okay in its own little way.
Every thing's okay in its own little way.
Every thing's okay in its own special way.
And everything's okay.

Clap your hands.
Clap your hands.
In slow mo.
Clap your hands.
As the camera.
Follows us.
Slow mo.

So take your fingers from my eyes.

Evacuate my life.

It's all your reason.
And morning through the night.
