The ONE Lyrics
by Un-Ez.


I just wanna be the one.
I just wanna be the one you love.
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down.
I just wanna, I just wanna fly.

Ima show you tonight.
That Ima put it on you baby.
Take you past the sky....

All my niggas stressing.
I know life is still a blessing.
Those with thicker skin only learn from harder lessons.
Searching for some answers.
Inside of these hidden questions.
My childhood went down in flames.
I burned through my adolescence.
I was a man since 14.
So now in 14.
You gotta give me the guillotine.
To separate me from my dreams.
And yeah I'm making green.
Enough for my bills and a Newport box and the matches.
That now live inside of my genes/.
Killing me slowly since late in my teens.
Stressing over The cost life while feeding morphine.
To my future medical needs.
Plus tax.
Once I get my shot.
I hope my success taste like cancer.
When I rap.
When you open a fresh pack.
Smoke that.

I just wanna be the one.
I just wanna be the one you love.
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down.
I just wanna, I just wanna fly.

Ima show you tonight.
That Ima put it on you baby.
Take you past the sky…

Gotta learn from our mistakes.
We gotta another chance.
Every single time we wake.
Why is it that we wait.
So long.
Sometimes it feels like it may be a little bit too late.
Hold on.
Fear is worst than hate so you need to.
Suit on.
Gotta bury all the weaknesses inside and move on.
Strong.
Like when I write me a song.
Patience be faithful cause.
Time less painful when we know.
What we came for.

I would try to make it work.
With the one i treated worst.
When I was still too young.
To really understand her worth.
If this curse is Gods work.
I hope all the wounds I've had to nurse.
And all my karma's on earth.
Eliminates all of your hurts.

One regret.
That's it.

To keep it moving don't really need to get fixed.

I just wanna be the one.
I just wanna be the one you love.
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down.
I just wanna, I just wanna fly.

Ima show you tonight.
That Ima put it on you baby.
Take you past the sky…
