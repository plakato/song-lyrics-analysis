Body Ash Lyrics
by The Zolas.

My balls are coals in the bottom of our bed.
That sags with the ash of our passion spent.
I kicked the coals to see if they're still lit.
Oh how much more can I take of this?
I don't know how much more I can take of this.

You get undressed and I watch the show.
You lie beside me but I stay cool.
Then the next morning again we go.
You dress for work and I watch that too.

I don't know how much more I can take of this.

I know this tunnel will end with light.
But I can't see it, I can't see it.
Must be a reason to stay polite.
But I can't see it, I can't see it.
I keep the fire alive in the night.

I'm sick of sleeping in body ash.
Our bed is heaping with body ash.
I'm sick of sleeping in body ash.
Our bed is heaping with body ash.

We go for coffee and comfy chairs.
Your pen is to your lips but I don't stare.
You lean over the table and between your hair.
I can't pretend that I don't see what's there.
Sure sure I'm a gentleman but this just ain't fair.
