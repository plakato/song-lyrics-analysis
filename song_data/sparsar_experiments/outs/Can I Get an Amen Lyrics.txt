Can I Get an Amen Lyrics
by RuPaul.


Given all you could to the relationship.
Like a full time job, nine to five you gotta work it, work it.
But the best of you has yet to arrive.
All the love inside is all the love you ever needed, needed.

All the dreams you had, all the things you wanted.
Don't turn your back, it's not too late.
You better love yourself, before you love somebody.
Love somebody, love somebody!

Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?

Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
A-amen.

RuPaul &amp; Martha Wash.
Say hello-goodbye, maybe another try.

'Til you realize, your love is alive.
All the love inside is all the love you ever needed, needed.

RuPaul &amp; Martha Wash.
All the dreams you had, all the things you wanted.
Don't turn your back, it's not too late.
You better love yourself, before you love somebody.
Love somebody, love somebody!

Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself.
somebody else?

Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself.

A-amen.

RuPaul &amp; Martha Wash.
There's a fork in the road.
Which way will you go?
You standing still or will you step into the great unknown?
It's yours to decide.
This is your life.
This is your life!

Can I get an amen?

Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?

Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?

Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself.
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?

A-amen.
