Anticoagulant Lyrics
by Swift.

Your face is blank.
Nothing has changed.
Promises made.
Nothing to gain.

I won't leave alone.
I'll take you with me.

Why do our smiles miss so many teeth?
Hidden behind these split lips and rosy cheeks.
And I play the patented hopeful role.
Grasping at every chance.
True romance in a friendship setting.
And then falling into the idea that everyone has forgotten everything that.
everyone else has done to them.

Hands tight, all grasping in space.
Life drains away.
Promises made.
And we're dying....
And we're dying in this state.

Your face is blank.

All these words that we throw.
I hope this won't take too long.

I'll glance back from that new place.
Realizing that I could never dish this out.
You see, I could never drink the tears from the cheeks of the young.
And then be left....
Left to pray.
Pray for a decent thought.
Or a phone call... on a random Sunday.

Hands tight, all grasping in space.
Life drains away.
Promises made.
And we're dying....
And we're dying in this state.

Your face is blank.
Nothing has changed.
Promises made.
I've got nothing to fucking gain.

And I'll take us.
We'll find ourselves in a new place.
And then they'll wake up.
And find our beds are empty.

Hands tight, all grasping in space.
Life drains away.
Promises made.
And we're dying....
And we're dying in this state.

I won't leave alone.
I won't leave alone.
I won't leave....
