The Young And Beyond Reckless Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.

A Puppet is only strong as its strings.
I forgive and forget, yet the truth still stings.
The lies are all easy, and the words are hard to swallow.
The leaders get killed, we're never fulfilled, yet we follow.

In the back of our minds we know.
But then the hearts keep letting go.
In the back of our minds we know.
I angst to let go.

Too many times, I've watched this crash and burn.
At the fork in the road.
We made a wrong turn.
We made a wrong.

If these apartment walls could talk.
Oh the story would be a nightmare.
When all you wants a dream.
We're just living a lie.
This will never survive.
So we run and hide.
Whenever the truth arrives.

In the back of our minds we know.
But then the hearts keep letting go.
In the back of our minds we know.
I angst to let go.

Too many times, I've watched this crash and burn.
At the fork in the road.
We made a wrong turn.
We made a wrong.

Don't you know I'm sick of this bullshit.
It's like I'm stuck in the ocean.
Take it away to the open.
Give it a day I'll be hoping for someone to rescue me.
Let me put a message in a bottle.
A note to self kid, you'll probably never learn.
These words are self-inflected.
The fork in this road is your heart choosing heaven or hell.
