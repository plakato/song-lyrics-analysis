Xavier Wulf &amp; Bones.
Damn.
Hello? What's up?
Yeah mane, ay look.
Look mane, I'm gonna do it mane!
Ay look mane I got $87, mane, that's it.
And I need some weed, and I need some LSD, man.

I got $87 for some LSD.
That's on me, fuck with me, homie.
I got $87 for some LSD.
That's on me, fuck with me.
I got $87 for some LSD.
That's on me, fuck with me.

LSD, please baby, please.
Hundred fifty strips, I'll be gone for a week.
LSD, please baby, please.
Lean on my dick if you ever try me.
LSD, LSD.
Please baby, please, I'm on LSD.
LSD, LSD.
Please baby, please, I'll be gone for a week.
