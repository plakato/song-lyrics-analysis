Chapter 13 Lyrics
by +44.

And my heart hangs from this noose.
Like your footsteps in crowded rooms.
Filled with sweet scents of autumn blooms.
Is this what you imagine?

Catch a glimpse from her empty stare.
Hidden eyes behind her auburn hair.
Catch my breath for the smoke to clear.
And it's just as it should be.

My best-laid plans.
Will build and break your heart.
Her guilty hands.
Tear my whole world apart.
My mind keeps racing.
She's softly dreaming.
I'm scraped and sober.
But there's no one listening.

And we'll wake up in vacant rooms.
Pull you close to my aching skin.
Broken glass on the porcelain.
Is this what you imagine?

We'll forget what we used to say.
And our lives won't mean anything.
Pull me close as I drift away.
And it's just as it should be.

And we'll both take our revenge.
But we still won't feel any better.
And we both take our revenge.
But we still don't feel any better.

And we'll both take our revenge.
But we still won't feel any better.
And we both take our revenge.
But we still don't feel any better.
And we'll both take our revenge.
But we still won't feel any better.
And we both take our revenge.
But we still don't feel any better.

I'm scraped and sober, but there's no one listening.
I'm scraped and sober, but there's no one listening.
I'm scraped and sober, but there's no one listening.
I'm scraped and sober, but there's no one listening to me at.
all.
