Calamity Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.

Everywhere I look, I see an ignorant fool. 
Why must I be placed in a world so distasteful, 
Only thing I smile for is children and a blunt too 
All you little rappers are so easily immeasurable 
Boy we heard your music and that shit is so unpleasurable 
Why. The fuck do labels pay these niggas to record you for 
You might be doing shows, but no one comes and gives a fuck 
But. When we doing a show, we will come light. Your whole city up 
I, pull up and turn him into a duck. He ain't showing up 
I, can tell from by the way that he talk that he a bitch boy 
From across the street. I saw him lem me pull him up. 
He was talking plenty, damn shit till he sobered up 
Bitch. They think I'm Ryu mixed with Ken. When I upper cut 
Bitch call me Kazuya when you know I'm finna power up 
Bitch Heihachi, let my squad send them choppers up 
I, don't need no guns. Bitch! I 
She was talking problem till she fucked around and hit my blunt 
Now. She stomped the line talking like she from where I'm from 
Bitch you niggas ain't, come from where I'm from 
It ain't, no fucking life, 
Boy, you niggas weak watch, you be born and dead, the same night 
Play with me. I bring the damn missile to a knife. Fight 
I'm the type to send that boy to hell just cause. I felt like it 
I control myself, sometimes but most times, I'm on auto-pilot 
That's, a fair warning in the air I'm unconscious and violent 
I could turn your whole neighborhood into a Lost island. 
After that you see me smoking blunts, I don't give no fuck, smiling 
Now me and my niggas being bothered by them label 
I'm the navigator. I will always find my way around them. 
You bitch
