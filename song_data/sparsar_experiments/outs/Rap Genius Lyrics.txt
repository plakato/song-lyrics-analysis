I'm riding on the beat like I don't give a fuck.
I'd rather have a bitch that could fuck and suck.
I'm swagging on the beat like is this enough?
Should I rap about guns so I'm really tough?
Young asshole should of went to class more.
Doing shit that ya'll never did.
And I'm fresh man like sophomore.
Ya'll niggas wack like soft porn.
And my points far like half court.
I don't play fair I'm a poor sport.
And Ya'll niggas green like osbourne.
Head of the party I'm always tardy.
I'm not a doctor I'm your papa I ain't.
Carry my team up on my back that's why I'm.
You tryna be king I'm sorry bro the spot is taken!

Rap Genius!, Rap Genius!
This shit is so convenient, Rap Genius!
What'd he say? What'd he say? Rap Genius!
So convenient my nigga Rap Genius!
Rap Genius!, Rap Genius!
This shit is so convenient, Rap Genius!
What'd he say? What'd he say? Rap Genius!
Rap Genius! my nigga Rap Genius!

It's Timmy, I'm killing, I'm back in the building.
Got racks to the ceiling, I laugh like a villain.
Might stack 50 million, might stack 50 billion.
Nigga I'm balling, that's Spaulding, that's Wilson.
As far as features, you call me, I kill it.
I'm just a youngin' that's ballin' like Krillin.
Bars got these wack rappers all in they feelings.
But I don't give two flying fucks how they feeling.
Ain't too many rappers next to me nigga.
D.E.A.D. till the death of me nigga.

Earning my stripes like a referee nigga.
Somebody tell this beat Rest In Peace nigga.
Soon someone should be arresting me nigga.
Cause this is straight murder, man fuck.
who you heard of.
Recording in my bedroom like I'm Bo Burnham.
Man fuck the lames.
They gone hate even though I slaughtered this shit.
They should call me James.
Cause I ball like LeBron in this bitch.
Sometimes these things happen.
Cause when I rap I mean it.
My raps the meanest, my raps the cleanest.
God damn motherfucker I'm a rapping genius RAP GENIUS!

Rap Genius!, Rap Genius!
This shit is so convenient, Rap Genius!
What'd he say? What'd he say? Rap Genius!
So convenient my nigga Rap Genius!
Rap Genius!, Rap Genius!
This shit is so convenient, Rap Genius!
What'd he say? What'd he say? Rap Genius!
Rap Genius! my nigga Rap Genius!
