Fuck The President Lyrics
by Unholy Homies.

my thoughts bend back the hands of time the plan is mine.
Rosebank resident its evident.

Cop kill me he better shoot he rest of the set cause my homies coming thru.
Ricocheting the tech.
Spit on ya corpse after niggas ain't paying respect.
Give a fuck bout a bitch I just slay and neglect.
Cut the check.
Like huaraches on the sole of my feet.
Young cold hearted niggas that be holding heat.
And if she just sucked dick she ain't Rollin the weed.

Unholy homies till my body like 6 feet deep.
Mentally disturbed cause of all the shit we see.
Bet she catch the vapors when she see us on tv.
Smoke like is no tomorrow.
Fronto wit a bar-tho.
8th of shrooms in each pocket of my cargos.
Flick the bick keep a lit spliff when the car go.
And if I make her smile than her lips getting borrowed.
Sprite &amp; oil tussle in a bottle.
Sex drive faster than a throttle of a SLS model.
Ya whole team hollow send an assassin to get ya hit man followed.

My thoughts bend back the hands of time.
The plan is mine.
Blowin like a Line land mine.
Guess what my nigga the land is mine.
We unholy but we coming from where it shines.
Rosebank resident it's evident.
And the fuck the president Weed nugs we severed it unholy.
Unruly niggas yea we meddling.
Young druggy veteran.
Lean flask in my letterman.
Or my bomber.
Inidigo be the aura.
My lungs are slaughtered.
All the smoke of marijuana.
Unholy lord hip hop is now restored.
Lyrics raw make Statue of Liberty swim to shore.
Astral project and praise my silver cord.
Checks I collect crowd surfing while on tour Crushing stages.
Promotors peel they venue off the floor.
And ya main bitch I fucked she said she feel it in her core.
I been on earths surface before.

my thoughts bend back the hands of time the plan is mine.
I'll blow like a land mine.
Rosebank resident its evident and fuck the president the weed nugs we severed.
it.
