Lemme Smang It Lyrics
by Yung Humma.

Mmmmmm Hmmmmm Hhmmmmm 
 
Hey little lady, how you feelin' 
It's Humma-Boo at the crib, just chillin' 
Tryin', to figure out what I'm gon na do today, 
How about you, throw on somethin' sexy and come my way. 
I got a treat for you, man, you gon na, like it 
I hear those giggles go ahead and get excited 
You say in the bed that your man is a lame guy. 
Havin' sex with him is just like watching paint dry 
Daaaayymn. I really hope that that ain't, true 
But, if it is here's what I'm gon na do for you 
And when you get here, I'm not just gon na Bang, it 
I'mma smash it too. So, let's just say, I'm gon na Smang It 
 
 Lem me Smang. It girl 
 
The way. I work that kitty gon na make your heart sang 
Now. Are you ready baby, then? Let'S get crazy, 
I hope your muscles warmed up you caaan't, be lazy. 
This is what I like to call Smash. Bang fusion 
 Got ta focus mama. Don'T wan na get a Cooch Contusion 
I like to mix it up? I like to do stuff.
