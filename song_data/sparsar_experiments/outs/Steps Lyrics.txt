Steps Lyrics
by Visual.

As I took my first steps, Rock with you
played in the background, 
Michael Jackson hit my soul like a spazzed crowd, 
All energy being fresh was a friend to me, 
80's baby, with 2000 tendencies. 
I used to have two Mike jackets with the zippers 
One red one white. I couldn't figure which was sicker 
One day. I left the red one on a Grey Hound bus 
When. I realized it. All I felt was disgust 
Headed to Cali the year was 1985 
Me
