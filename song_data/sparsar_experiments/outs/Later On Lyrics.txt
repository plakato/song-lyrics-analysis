Later On Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Hey babe won't you tell me what you've got going on.
Just a little later on tonight.
How about you and me get together have a couple drinks.
Well don't you think that sounds like, a good time.

You start striding over.
We can't get no closer.
Ain't no room in the middle.
Girl watcha doing a little later.

Let's go start a fire.
How about you and i get this thing moving shaking grooving.
Baby tell me what your doing.
Later on later on later on later on later on later on.

Girl your shining like a movie star.
And y'know you look so good.
I can't stop staring.
And I can tell that your feelin' it too.
What you wanna do with that smile your wearing.
Oh yeah.

What you say we got lost lets go.
Spend a couple hours just getting to know each other.
Out there in the moonlight glow.
And when we get alone.

You start striding over.
We can't get no closer.
Ain't no room in the middle.
Girl watcha doing a little later.

Let's go start a fire.
How about you and i get this thing moving shaking grooving.
Baby tell me what your doing.
Later on later on later on later on later on later on.

You start striding over.
We can't get no closer.
Ain't no room in the middle.
Girl watcha doing a little later.

Let's go start a fire.
How about you and I get this thing moving shaking grooving.
Baby tell me what your doing.
Later on later on later on later on later on later on.
