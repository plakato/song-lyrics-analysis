Yung Joc 
Joc Joc, don't stop! Oh, my God you're. So hot 
Catch me on yo' block with 4 Glocks and 4 shots 
Bet, you niggas know not. Try me like a ho, not 
Niggas run in kick the do'. Fuck, a do', knock 
 Got ta, make the quarter. I mix it with the soda 
I chop the dope and sell it with the Razor Motorola 
Hold up'fore. I have to load up hollow tips. They explode up. 
Leave you pussy niggas wet as chocha stankin with the odor 
 
Bring, your own beer to the party aight~ 
Bring, your own beer to the party aight~ 
Bring, your own beer to the party motherfuckers 
Cause. I heard you came to have a good time, aight~ 
Alright. Alright, alright, alright, ah, let's go~ 
Alright, alright, alright, alright! Ah, let's go~ 
Alright, alright, alright, alright! Ah, let's go~ 
Alright, alright, alright! Alright, let's go motherfucker 
 
Yung Joc, 
Yeahhhhhhhh, 
Yung Joc, so jiggy Lear Jet to yo' city 
Monday, night Magic City thunderstorm, when I'm tippin 
Ice game super nifty super kush, two for fifty 
Fat boy, yellin out pop bottles'til, I'm tipsy 
I, like my chick booty, big-o lay My head on them big ole's, 
Put her on her tiptoes I get up in the middle 
I, don't wine them dine them or rest have'em 
I'm the # 1 playboy. I press play and 
 
Yung Joc 
Party, like a rockstar better, yet block bar 
Lighter to the ceiling grab a beer pop, the top boi 
I.F., so clear, freezer burn both ears 
Elders, say, Oh dear, when they hear I'm near 
Rubber, burn first gear platinum on my First year, 
Wood on my sheer put my wood all in her grill 
Roof on fire, sound the alarm. 
We don't need water, 
, 
Yung, Joc, 
Ha ha, 5. 4. 3. 2. R-2-D-2 
Let me see your robot a little dance that we do. 
Pyrite no left, I'm hype with no help. 
On cloud 9 heart racin, like Corvette 
I, need a material girl in a material world. 
Give me slim on the backseat of my Imperial girl 
Go, and show me what you work with girl. That'S a perfect fit 
Hold up! Stop it hurts when you twist it
