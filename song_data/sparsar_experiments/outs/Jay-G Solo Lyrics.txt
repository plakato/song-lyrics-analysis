Jay-G Solo Lyrics
by 415 fossas.


No stress no trip 
 
Every line like a brand new whip, 
 
Bitches callin me the ace of spades, 
 
Cuz. Every girl I met, gets aids. 
 
My career was beginning to fade 
 
Making raps, just to get paid 
 
Prison rape and nigger apes, 
 
My music was no longer my escape 
 
Shitting in the closet. Watching my balls drip 
 
I realized. My life was one of a slave ship, 
 
Speed in my veins, no longer in pain, 
 
You, beginning to complain, taking my lines in vain 
 
Bitch. Listen as I make these lines, rain, 
, 
So fast, so clear, 
, 
So, fresh, so dear 
, 
So light. No drear 
 
All fire, no smoke, 
 
All hits no joke. 
 
These are the words that I have spoke. 
 
Make money make bank 
 
Make power, make rank 
 
Make fast, make jank 
 
Welcome to the world of my think. Tank 
 
Now lets bring this shit back to court 
 
These one liners beginning to become their own sport, 
 
After ejaculation. I still produce a dry quart 
 
Living life as if i'm the MVP 
 
My blood is filled. Wth. The HIV 
 
Some may see this a problem. Even a curse, 
 
Living a lie. I can't deny 
 
My music career belongs with the 4.1.5 
 
The fossas has kept my drive. 
 
Some may call it dumb. Maybe a threat 
 
Do, not fret. We are adept once you hear our lyrics. Even your mom will be wet 
 
Dropping, the first album without breaking a sweat, 
, 
So fast, so clear, 
, 
So fresh. So dear 
, 
So light no drear, 
 
All fire, no smoke. 
 
All hits no joke. 
 
These are the words that I have spoke: 
 
Make money make bank 
 
Make power, make rank 
 
Make fast, make jank 
 
Welcome to the world of my think. Tank
