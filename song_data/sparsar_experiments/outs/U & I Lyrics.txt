U & I Lyrics
by XO.


When we see our reflection.
Is it strange that I'm not stood beside you?
Lost all sense of direction.
I just wonder if you'd search for me too.

I can't go on.
The memories show this ?, not how it used to be.
I'm moving on.
Nothing can compare to who we could have been.

You and I.
Do you ever think of.
You and I?

You and I.
Do you ever think of.
You and I?

You and I.
You and I.
You and I.
You and I.

Sleepless nights, I've been restless.
Since you left it's been like this for some time.
Girl, your touch is infectious.
I just need to feel your skin upon mine.

I can't go on.
The memories show this ?, not how it used to be.
I'm moving on.
Nothing can compare to who we could have been.

You and I.
Do you ever think of.
You and I?

You and I.
Do you ever think of.
You and I?

You and I.
You and I.
You and I.
You and I.
