Make A Change Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

Prayer strikes the ground.
Like a rhino charging I go forward.
The black sky pushed back.
And my shoes of the Gospel break to a sprint.
As I follow the winding track.
With a fusion of past and present.
The heart of Christ and tenacity of a lion Bonds break.
My home is where he takes me.
Still I've got to learn the joy of flying.

This is the hour.
No excuse to wait.
This nation is needing a shake up.
Holy Spirit is ready and able.
Now is the time for the prayers to wake up.

Pray Come on.
Pray Everybody make a change today.
Pray Come on.
Pray Make a change.

Strike the ground not 3 but 6 times.
See the barriers pushed back when God moves.
Move the hand that moves the world.
When all is His then what can I lose.
Fixed thoughts present into a mirror.
Fans the spark sometimes into a flame.
A whispered word.
The wind blows nearer.
I desire refreshment brought by rain.

Unsure I tread at first slowly.
But as faith grows my steps get braver.
I wanna blaze.
My soul engraved with the truth of the name of Jesus.
Saviour.
Sometimes I stumble and end up in a mess.
To the eyes of Jesus.
I need to gaze.
Need to shout.
Break the dry ground.
The passion flows.
My spirit raised.
