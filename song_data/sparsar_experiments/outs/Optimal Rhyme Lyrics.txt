Optimal Rhyme Lyrics
by Wonder Bred.

Pshhh Calling for backup.
Pshhh Shots have been fired.
Pshhh Radio.
Pshhh Don't Call me Radio Unit 91.
Pshhh Don't Call me Unit 91, Radio Pshhh.

The Devil might be at any one of my shows.
Even in the front row.
In any event though.
I sing Gone Insane by Ab-Soul.
This Tempo can go slow.
Lights out, No Lighters now, Let your inside glow.
Enlighten those who don't know.

For Your entertained Information.
My open aimed inclination.
Is to Be Home on Vacation.
The Music which this minstrel's making.
Is my most simple vocation.

The oven which I bake with is unconventional.
The heat from my flame is indispensable.

That's Eternal as it Shines.
From my leopard Spotted Mind.
I left a lot of dots so you can walk the dotted line.
Now that's an optimal rhyme.
There's no plot to Optimus Prime.
I mean, Why would you watch Transformers 5?

There's no plot to Optimus Prime.
I mean, Why would you watch Transformers 5?

Pshhh Calling for backup.
Pshhh Shots have been fired.
Pshhh Radio.
Pshhh Don't Call me Radio Unit 91.
Pshhh Don't Call me Unit 91, Radio Pshhh.
