Urvasi Lyrics
by Swetshop Boys.

Heems.
Jungle Book.
The brown mans burden.
Teach these white people all this shit.
The brown mans burden.

Riz.
Wonder how to slap the words.
Stoppped by the system, random search.
But no friskin, just shit cancel ?
The heat so the hounds on fans'll work.
Riz and Hima, double team brah.
Hey look at me brah.
We cooking Qeema.
Teach the keester ? man's beemer.
Treat her like ? in Karachi theme parks.

Heems.
It's conscious garbage, constant nonsense.
Hima loves kush like i'm ?
Got the jungle fever like my name is Rambo.
I be on kush like my name Ugambo.
Indian man, I be rhyming in Budapest.
When I'm in Bucharest, bitties say you the best.
Bitties say you da next, vis a vis stupid mess.
Fuck me like they new to sex.
Let me send a stupid text.

Riz.
If anyone told me, that I'm ready for bigger pawn.
Just get a big hit and you're set to the sickest pawn.
But until then you put this fake dick on and hold this ?
What the fuck that they think the mans on.
Prounce it Riz-a-wan if you want, I don't give it a bollock.
Just want my wallet ? pop up ?
I handle stress like ? it's double yes i'm the don.
Doctor Who to you, fam, hum aap.
kay hain kahn?

Heems.
Who they riding shotty in Alec's Beemer.
If they want beef, I could cook the kima.
Zim Zima, Simba, it seem ya.
Need to get used to being a dreamer.
For better or worse, they know Hima.
Number 1 schemer, TSA screener.
I'm stunting, I'm Jackie Shroff or something.
On my dick, it's nothing.
I know I'm the shit, they fronting.
One king, xiao long bao, soup.
dumplings.
Me and Rizzy Boy from across the pond.
Bitches putting DMT in our oolang.
With a bad bitty.
And she from Shilong.
Her put her mouth on my shlong.
She wants to sing songs on my ding dong.
With the white girl like I'm King Kong.
