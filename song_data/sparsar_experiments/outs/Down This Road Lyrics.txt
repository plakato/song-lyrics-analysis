Down This Road Lyrics
by Bizarre.


You ain't ever been down this road before 
You ain't ever seen. A J running with no clothes 
Grandmama beat the switches where the air wind rolls 
Sold a sack in the culdasack down that road, 
 
Take a left, motherfucker 
, 
Catfish, Billy ain't, it Bizarre tho, 
Country, motherfuckers yup.. I got a carload 
Got, a 30 pack of Bud in this Monte, Carlo 
And, I'm macking this slut, who got an ass like a barn door, 
Told her I'll give her the stick for a carton of marlboro's. 
My boy said I'm tripping, but she looked at it. Its charm tho 
What, a mystic man. I am with this art flow 
Like, creek water. We harder than a drunk trying to dart, throw 
Chevy's in the back. Barretta'S click clack 
Mullets. In the Starter Jacket, your babies in the bed 
Gave my mama keys to a 1980 lac' 
She. Let her boyfriend see it and we never got it back. 
Fuck it. It'S a bucket 
A bullet's in budget I'll, just go back to cookie, cutting 
And reach under the rug and pull out a sack of bud. 
And hit my buddy up for a nugget 
Buddy, it's all in the family, and I mean family by cousins. 
And. We sitting in a fucking beanbag on the front porch swinging lean back 
Big truck riding, never clean that buckshot signs. You ain't ever seen: that
 
75 north an hour from Toledo, 
Blue chevy's, big body, Regal's, 
Hammerton, tuxedo, home of HKiller, raised by lions, tigers, gorrilla's
 
Red, Magnum Helicopter doors., Big potholes will fuck up your 24's 
Detroit Michigan, where people dont care no more 
Chrysler and Ford plant. They ain't there. No more 
20/20 vision make the wrong decision: 
Get, 5 to 10 and Jackson, Prison, 
Abandoned homes, drug dealers, 
crack addicts, lots of white boys, but ain't no B-Rabbit 
When, I got ta. Have it blowing that kush 
Car started out? I need that push 
The home of the purple gang and
the home of Coleman, Young 
Detroit Michigan great place not to come
