Peace of Mind Lyrics
by Boston.


Now, if your feelin' kinda low'bout the dues you've been payin', 
Future's comin' much too slow, 
And you wan na run, but somehow you keep on stayin' 
Can't decide on which way to go. 
 
I understand about indecision 
But. I don't care if I get behind 
People living in competition. 
All I want is to have my peace of mind. 
 
Now you're, climbing to the top of the company ladder 
Hope. It doesn't take too long. 
Can'T, you see there'll come a day when it won't matter. 
Come a day when you'll be gone, 
 
Take a look ahead, 
Take a look ahead: 
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, 
 
Well everybody's got advice. They just keep on givin' 
Dosen't mean to much to me. 
Lots of people have to make believe they're livin' 
Can't decide who they should be 
 
Take a look ahead: 
Take a look ahead: 
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, 
 
Look, ahead
