BETTER Lyrics
by X.E.X.


Can I make it better ?
Can I make it better ?
Can I make it better - baby ?

Better Better Better.

Ocean tides.
Invade your eyes.
You're hurt inside.
So blame my life.

Can I make it better ?
Can I make it better ?
Can I make it better - baby ?

I see my sin.
This dark ain't thin.
Blame my time, Blame my time - baby.
So blame my life, my life , my life , my life.
