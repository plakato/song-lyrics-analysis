Feel It In My Bones Lyrics
by 4th Pyramid.


I'M so hip hop my hip popped 
Shattered into pieces when I hit it on the block 
Bum, with a broken arm holding out his hand 
Froze in the middle lane, hoping I could Stand 
Eyes poking out. The van 
Sprawled on the road, like beans pouring out a can 
Steel on my hip
