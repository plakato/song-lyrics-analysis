Oh Bondage! Up Yours! Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

Some people say little girls should be seen and not heard.
But I say....
Oh Bondage! Up yours!
Bind me tie me.
Chain me to the wall I wanna be a slave.
To you all.
Oh bondage up yours.
Oh bondage no more.
Oh bondage up yours.
Oh bondage no more.
Chain-store chain-smoke.
I consume you all.
Chain-gang chain-mail.
I don't think at all.
Oh bondage up yours.
Oh bondage no more.
Oh bondage up yours.
Oh bondage no more.
Thrash me crash me.
Beat me till I fall.
I wanna be a victim.
For you all.
Oh bondage up yours.
Oh bondage no more.
Oh bondage up yours.
Oh bondage no more.
