No Gravity (Beyonc√© Demo) Lyrics
by Unknown Artist.


Oh, Oh 
Oh, Oh 
 
I'd rather be dead or crazy, crazy 
Than to live without my baby baby 
 
Everybody wants to be a star 
But. We got something bigger. We got something bigger than that 
Look up up to the stars, 

Riding in a spaceship 
Doing. It no gravity 
Riding in a spaceship 
Love. The way you're grabbing me 
Riding in a spaceship 
Doing. It no gravity, gravity, 
Love, love, love the way, you're grabbing me, 
 
I, don't need no air 
Love. The way you're grabbing me 
When you're, when you're pulling out my hair 
I, don't need no air 
Baby. We can make love in your spaceship. 
I wan na make love in your spaceship 
Let's. Do it with no gravity 
 
Even, when I'm feeling lazy, lazy, 
I still put in work 9-to-5 over time? Just for my baby 
Just for my baby baby 
 
Everybody wants to be a star 
But. We got something bigger. We got something bigger than that 
Look up up to the stars, 

Riding in a spaceship 
Doing, it no gravity 
Riding in a spaceship 
Love. The way you're grabbing me 
Riding in a spaceship 
Doing, it no gravity, gravity, 
Love, love, love the way, you're grabbing me 
 
I. Don'T need no air 
Love the way you're grabbing me 
When you're, when you're pulling out my hair 
I, don't need no air 
Baby. We can make love in your spaceship. 
I wan na make love in your spaceship 
Let's. Do it with no gravity 
 
If. I blow a kiss. It floats straight to you, 
All of my loving, just gravitates to you 
 .
 No, there can't be a limit when 
Edge of the world is where we begin begin. 
 
So. Let'S do it with no gravity 
Do it do it with no gravity. 
 
I. Don'T need no air 
Love. The way you're grabbing me 
When you're, when you're pulling out my hair 
I, don't need no air 
Baby. We can make love in your spaceship. 
I wan na make love in your spaceship 
Let's. Do it with no gravity 
 ?
 Let'S do it with no gravity .
 Let'S do it with no gravity .
 Let'S do it with no gravity .
 Let'S do it with no
gravity
