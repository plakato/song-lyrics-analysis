Aeroplane Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: Silver Haze.
Aeroplane.
I cannot hear a single whisper.
I cannot see an open eye.
And the faces I see are indifferent to me.
And my soul becomes the aeroplane.
Never a thought of parachuting.
I am given to the winds just like a kite.
I am upside, I'm downside.
And I'm rolling around.
As my soul becomes the aeroplane.
I'm the aeroplane.
I am the wheel.
I'm the maker so give it a try.
Believe me, I sure can make you fly.
I am your pilot.
The aeroplane is all inside your head.
I am everything you said.
You ever needed.
