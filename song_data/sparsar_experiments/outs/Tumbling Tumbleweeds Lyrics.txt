Tumbling Tumbleweeds Lyrics
by Quebe Sisters.


See them tumbling down.
Pledging their love to the ground.
Lonely but free I'll be found.
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

Cares of the past are behind.
Nowhere to go but I'll find.
Just where the trail will wind.
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

I know when night has gone.
That a new world's born at dawn.

I'll keep rolling along.
Deep in my heart is a song.
Here on the range I belong.
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

He's a roving cowboy riding all day long.
Tumbleweeds around him sing their lonely song.
Nights underneath the prairie moon.
He rides along and sing a tune.
