Trippin' Lyrics
by Big Season Muzik.


What'S up baby, why you acting all funny and shit? 
 
Why! You don't trust me when I hit the clubs with my homies/We, keep on fighting about you being lonely. 
You! Don'T care about us! You just want my money/Sometimes. I be fucking some honeys! 
You! Don'T want to have sex in the bed/On my side, you trying to look for some
bread 
You, be losing your mind like a psycho/Trying to act like a big ego. 
Buying you bugatti, gucci and diamonds/Go all around the world. Relax at the islands 
Always taking you on a first class flight/After that me and you end up in a
fight 
We was like the birds and bees/Now. We ain't nothing but enemies. 
We used to do a lot of hugging and kissing/But everyday girl. You always
tripping 
 
Girl. You always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
 
Why. You got ta, be so naive for no reason/Playing games with me. My heart is full of passion. 
Everytime you got ta, be so rude/When. You come and see me you not in a mood 
Wearing, tacky, ass dresses and them high ass heels/By. The way you don't give a
fuck about how I feel 
You said: I'm wack, my songs, ain't, real/Like, R. Kelly, says it pays the
bills 
Selling. My beats got the cash and the fame/You ain't go no job, while I'm in
the rap game 
Always going shopping spending. All of my cash/Everytime. You won't let me
tap that ass 
What I brought for you. Everything is mine/You, just a girl who wasting my
fucking time 
We used to do a lot of hugging and kissing/But. Now all the time girl, you
always, tripping, 
 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
 
You, acting like there's. No love between you and me/You wouldn't have shit. If
It wasn't for me, 
You be waiting at my crib, while I'm at the studio/You don't live with me. You
Live in a condo 
I bought diamonds, pearls dresses and cars/The reason why you got those cause
I'm, a rap star. 
I thought you was my queen, my pretty angel/Right from start. I knew you was
trouble 
I cancel your credit cards broke. All of your jewerly/I felt like I was in hell because you was crazy. 
I was stupid for getting with you/What the fellas said about. You was true. 
You out of my life, like Mike/Since, you gone, you need to take a hike, 
We used to do a lot of hugging/Now. We done cause girl, you always tripping 
 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl. You always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
Girl, you always tripping 
 
Yeah back in full effect, 
Big Season with some new shit. You know what I'm sayin' for the 2-K-1-4 
Let the instrumental ride
