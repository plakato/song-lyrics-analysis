Hate Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

You build me up and then you break me down and build me again.
Emotions weaken.
My blood is filled with lust knowing someone is wanting to kill me.
We all go someday.

I get so much more from this than you do.
I get so much more from this than you.

Haaaate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna free your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna feed your....
Come on get up!
Come on get up!
Come on get up!

There must be someway I can better my health to save me.
From all the bad things that feel so good.
You must be joking, you don't even know a thing about it.
It's what you understood.

I get so much more from this than you do.
I get so much more from this than you.

Haaaate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna free your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna free your....
Come on get up!
Come on get up!
Come on get up!

I get so much more from this than you do.
I get so much more from this than you.

Haaaate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna free your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna free your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna free your hate!
You wanna feed your hate!
You wanna feed your....
