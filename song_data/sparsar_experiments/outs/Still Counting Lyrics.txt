Still Counting Lyrics
by Volbeat.

Counting all the assholes in the room.
Well I'm definitely not alone, well I'm not alone.
You're a liar, you're a cheater, you're a fool.
Well that's just like me yoo-hoo and I know you too.
Mr. Perfect don't exist my little friend.
And I tell you it all again, and I'd do it again.
Counting all the assholes in the room, well I'm.
Definitely not alone, well I'm not alone.

Look deep into yourself before you blame all others.
For betrayal, now for betrayal.
I promise, so easy to say, and easy you fail, and you'd do it again.

Well the music seems to cover.
And the liquid through the colors.
Well I turn my back and.
Go for all the better things in order.

Well maybe you think your lie is safe.
But I read you like a letter, yeah like a letter.
Your charm do not evens the pain.
It feeds me with rage, and you'd do it again.

And a gangster keep on telling.
That he got a song that matters.
So I flip a coin towards him.
Thank you very much for listening.
