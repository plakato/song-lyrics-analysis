Astral Plane Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

And I have been here before.
I don't understand how I've returned.
I have seen where this takes me.
I didn't choose this path.

Take me home.
I've found the road.

Take me home.
Take me home.
I've found my home.

Take me to a better place.
Where I'm who I was born to be.
This wasn't what I envisioned.
I'm not who I know I'm Supposed to be.

I've searched and searched, I've laid awake at night.
I've walked through the darkness.
I've ran to the light.
I've ran to the light.

And there was nothing there but questions I had.
With answers I couldn't find.
Have I lost my mind?
Is this all there is left to life?
Is this all there is?
Is this it?
Is this all there is left to life?

Take me home.
