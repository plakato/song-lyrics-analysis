Over and Over Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Help me up this time.
You fooolishly here, left me in the dark.
Maybe it's not right.
I could never love you like I want.

It's never easy, cause I got it bad.
It's not funny cause, I never wanted this.
All the wasted time.
It's left me feeling older, oh it's fine.

We do it over, and over, and over again.
We do it over, and over, and over again.
All our moments.
All our moves.
We do it over, and over, and over again.
Keep doing it over, and over, and over again.

It's not right what you know.
But it's not fair what you don't know.
It's not right what you know.
But it's not fair what you don't know.
