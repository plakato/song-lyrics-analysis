Get It Right Lyrics
by Union J.

Hey, hey.

We've been holding on.
Stronger now we've made it to the shore.
The hurricane won't follow us no more.
And together we know what we're fighting for.
Hey, hey.

Cause we're here to stay.
Living in the moment, it's our day.
And all the love we had, it still remains.
We're never going back the way we came.
Hey, hey.

Cause we've been waiting for this all our lives.
Though we'll try.
To get it right, get it right.
Yeah, I swear we'll get it right.
Cause all along, you and I.
Have been the one thing to survive.
I see the love in your eyes.
As I lay with you tonight.
Every time, you and I.
Oh, I swear we'll get it right.

All I need to be.
Is learning how to live and what will be.
Don't forget we're making history.
Cause promises all build on what we dream.
Hey, hey.

Get it right, get it right.
Yeah, I swear we'll get it right.
All along, you and I.
Have been the one thing to survive.
See the love in your eyes.
As I lay with you tonight.
Every time, you and I.
Oh, I swear we'll get it right.

Get it right, get it right.
Yeah, I swear we'll get it right.
Cause all along, you and I.
Have been the one thing to survive.
I see the love in your eyes.
As I lay with you tonight.
Every time, you and I.
Oh, I swear we'll get it right.

Singing, oh, we'll get it right.
We'll get it right.
We'll get it right.
Singing, oh, we'll get it right.
We'll get it right.
Yeah.
