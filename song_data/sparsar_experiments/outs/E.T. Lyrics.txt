E.T. Lyrics
by Uncut Diamondz.

I'm a be what I wanna be.
Cause Ain't like these wanna be's, I'm that nigga you wanna be.

Tell my girl she could lay low.
Put my homies on my pay roll.
Making music is what I get paid for.
Make a stuck up chick act playful.
Make a sorry nigga act grateful.
Cause I do what I do, help my niggas get a plateful.
Aye, we all aboard, used to want accords.
Now we all want beamers, benz and Bentley's we on the same accord.
Remember when I couldn't afford a ford.
Now I'm that King Author like a nigga pulled a sword.
Out of a stone or something, I'm born for stunting its nothing future.
connoisseur.
Niggas think you losing your marbles till you got marble floors.
Ya'll grinding basic, while mogul status I'm chasing.
Made a couple bills off of free vitamin water cases.
Ya'll don't understand, how I'm thinking though.
I'm trying to have the hand, that could turn this shit to gold.
Pick your role, and play it, my niggas give me the pick and roll.
I'm saying we all gone make it, its give and go, soâ€¦

So we chilling with the stars.
We all could leave earth, I know you seen that face on mars.
I'm just saying, there's more to this shit.
I brought my niggas with me, we all on this spaceship and we gone, we gone.
We gone take it to the stars.
They gonna say that we the brightest that they ever saw.
We ET'ing yeah x2.
I'm out this world, they think I'm ET.

Its funny how the greatest things in life are free.
Like memories of watching BET late night at 3.
Watching Uncut, before I had the name Uncut.
When we was doing credit card scams, just to get our funds up.
Got some Jays, got some rims, and every jersey that was in.
Just a phase that I was in, till the stage looked promising.
Still gotta bring dollars in, my mom talking about college and.
I say she right, I know she right, but rapping can't get scholarships.
Mama I ain't lawyer, but I know about music politics.
Been through a lot of it, but its how you come out of it.
Shit I seen Jay Z go to Brooklyn, build his own arena.
And 50 cent made a flavored version of Aquafina.
Want something sweeter, this ain't enough, over achiever.
My friends could testify for that like they got subpoenaed.
I tip my hat to these legends, looking at heavens.
Wondering if I could get there before I die if I took the second.

So we chilling with the stars.
We all could leave earth, I know you seen that face on mars.
I'm just saying, there's more to this shit.
I brought my niggas with me, we all on this spaceship and we gone, we gone.
We gone take it to the stars.
They gonna say that we the brightest that they ever saw.
We ET'ing yeah x2.
I'm out this world, they think I'm ET.

Who you challenging, stars on TV I'm Channeling.
Good in crunch time like when your working out your abdomen.
If she plus size, on the guestlist I never add em in.
The hardest spitting out of my region, the South's Adiment.
Mkay, niggas hustle like Kim K.
They was fucking with that Reggie and upgraded to that Ye.
They used to the high, need something stronger to get em straight.
My bars fufill they order, I'm honored to get this cake.
Cause you could've choose to listen to something different, you choose me.
Now get your homies, addicted till they OD.
Doing what they told us we couldn't cause they don't know us.
Hood niggas go to Atrium, me I roll with the owners.
Uh, I need it more so I'm killing shit every morning.
I'm killing shit we in mourning, all black and liquor pouring.
Your widow she in distress and my niggas is going for it.
She gone lift up that dress ah yes.

So we chilling with the stars.
We all could leave earth, I know you seen that face on mars.
I'm just saying, there's more to this shit.
I brought my niggas with me, we all on this spaceship and we gone, we gone.
We gone take it to the stars.
They gonna say that we the brightest that they ever saw.
We ET'ing yeah x2.
I'm out this world, they think I'm ET.
