14th Secret Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


Relaxin, what's your satisfaction.
I knew by your reaction that it was no need in asking.
Skin soft, get them clothes ripped off.
I wanna see you shine the same way as your lipgloss.
My rasta tenderoni, never roll them swishers boney.
We can blow a couple candles.
Baby, put some wishes on me.
My patience is anxious for what you got to offer.
Sex positions with the proper posture.

And he trippin, he trippin.
Baby, baby girl just keep it on the low.
Just keep it, just keep it down.
Baby, baby he ain't got to know.
And he trippin, he trippin.
Baby girl, baby keep it on the low.
Cause my niggas, my niggas.
Have you over here smoking that honor roll.
Cause my niggas, my niggas.
Have you over here smoking that honor roll.

She looking for passion, I'm looking action.
Baby, what's happenin'.
You can be my lady for the night.
Skin so smooth and wavy feeling right.
Even the slightest touch can bring you pleasure.
This site of you's a buried treasure.
Wet up in any weather.
Leggings, jeans or leather.
Better yet, don't stress that.
Hands crawlin down your leg.
Toss it off, get in my bed.
I love the way you do them tricks.
I knew you was the finest pick.
From all time you sent them flicks.
Gave a little preview.
From all those nasty clips.
You're everything a nigga wish.
Strip, Dip, Grip.
Hands all on ya hips.
And I know You taste me when you lick ya lips.
Yeah.
