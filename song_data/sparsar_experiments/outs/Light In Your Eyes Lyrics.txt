Light In Your Eyes Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

I can't help the years that I've cried, can't you see I'm dying?
Can't you see we've been here before except this time I'm needing you more.
I need you more, I need you more.
Can you get me out of this shell? Can't you see I'm living in hell?
I live in hell, I live in hell, can you tell?

You  to my way, can I be your life?
You see through that , took some color out of the skies.
It's in your eyes, it's in your eyes.
When you hear in hole that we tide, can't you see I've cleaned in the night?
And you're the light, and you're the light, you're the light.

And you're the crier in my mind, you're so  and I can fly.
The words are silent and I can see you then I was gone.
So I come back and  a time, they used and lived me till.
No more  me, see the light shine from your eyes.
