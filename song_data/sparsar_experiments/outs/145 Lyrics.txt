Love.
This is getting harder.
And I can't seem to pick you out of the crowd.
But you my dear.
Have been discovered a liar.
And I'm afraid that this is building up for far too long.

And this is not the time or place for us speak like this.
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water.

In a different time or place the words can make more sense.
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water.

Even though it's the last time.

Love.
This is getting the best of me.
And truth be told, you were the start of it all.
Now you my dear, might end up lonely.
Before you go, there's something you should know.

And this is not the time or place for us to speak like this.
And if I ever had the thought I'd never dream of it.
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water.

In a different time or place the words can make more sense.
In a perfect world, the future wouldn't make it then.
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water.

Even though it's the last time.

This is not the time or place for us to speak like this.
And if I ever had the thought I'd never dream of it.
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water.

In a different time or place the words can make more sense.
In a perfect world, the future wouldn't make it then.
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water.

Please, let's not speak, don't breathe a word.
Even though it's the last time.

Please, let's not speak, don't breathe a word.
Even though it's the last time.
