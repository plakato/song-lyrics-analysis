Big Hopes Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


I am not brave and I'm not too smart.
The tin man wouldn't trade for my heart.
Got two left feet when I am dancing.
And a long history of brief romances.
Got no rubies, got no diamonds.
None passed down and I cannot buy them.
Got a box of hurt and a bag of shame.
And you barely know my name.

I've got big, big hopes about you.
Yeah, I've got big, big hopes.

Got an old leather jacket, would look good on you.
And lots of friends, they would like you too.
I've got some pull with the moon and tides.
And thirty-two dollars, lets go somewhere tonight.

I've had hopes before, but not like this.
I'm flying over the edge into the sweet abyss.
I've got some pull with the moon and tides.
And thirty two dollars, lets go somewhere tonight.
