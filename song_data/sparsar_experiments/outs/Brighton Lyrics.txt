Brighton Lyrics
by Swelo.


I'm waiting for the wind to come.
And carry me away.
Across the oceans and the stars.
I've been waiting every day.
And if you should hear my name.
Don't let anybody say.
I've been hiding for a while.
I'm just tryna get away.

But you are.
My only escape.
And you are.
The only way, yeah.

So let's talk.
That's all we'll do, just talk.
And when we're through we'll know.
We won't have to keep on waiting, oh.
So let's talk.
That's all we'll do, just talk.
And when we're through we'll know.
We won't have to keep on waiting, oh.
So let's talk.
That's all we'll do, just talk.
And when we're through we'll know.
We won't have to keep on waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.
