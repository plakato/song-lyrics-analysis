Meant Something To Me Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Well a kiss might be just a kiss to you.
But baby it meant something to me.
And a night to remember might be.
Just a Monday in September.
Baby it meant something to me.

I know you try.
It's gotta come from the heart.
I know I believe it's the hardest part of love.

And cause you can remember.
The 22nd day in November.
Baby you mean something to me.

I know you try.
Baby it's gotta come from the heart.
Well I know I believe it's the hardest part of love.

And a kiss might be just a kiss to you.
Baby it meant something.
Or maybe it meant nothing.
But baby it meant something to me.
