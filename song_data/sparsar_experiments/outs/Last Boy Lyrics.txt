Last Boy Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

These chords.
Have probably been used.
A thousand times bfore.
To write songs about girls.
I don't think they've been used.
To sing about you.
But honestly I can't be sure.
You probably know.
Lots of boys who play guitar.
You're the kind of girl.
Who attracts.
Boys who write songs.
Writing one about you.
Really wasn't hard.
I've always like girls.
Who have.
Broken a few hearts.

But I want to be.
The last boy.
To love you.

Want to be.
The last boy.
That you love too.

All those boys before.
All those girls before.
All those.
Stops and starts and ends.
We can just ignore.
The past never adds.
Up to much.
Where you've been.
Isn't half as important.
As where you end up.
