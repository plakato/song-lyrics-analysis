Never Lyrics
by Unknown Prophets.

In this life time, you don't have to proove nothing to nobody except yourself, 
And after what you've gone through. If you havn't done that by now, 
It ain't gon na never happen, 
 
Yo, hey y'all, I'm never. What you'd expect me to be 
Clever like that? Just when you cats, think you know me 
Never, let the negativity hold or stop me 
Never forget all this. What hip-hop has taught me 
And, even though the Prophets might never get signed, 
Never drop a video or go platinum with the rhymes 
It'll be cool just to knowin that we've touched a few 
And rocked the mic with some of the dopest emcees too 
 
You'll. Never catch jas, giving anything less than my all 
And I'll forever be with Madsun. Until the day I fall, 
I'll never be as dope as you dawg, but I can live with that. 
You'Ll always get love from me, but you
