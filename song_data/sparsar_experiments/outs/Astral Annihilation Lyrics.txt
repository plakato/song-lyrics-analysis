Astral Annihilation Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

Run tonight, lest death find you.

There's no escaping from this raging fire.

Watch the stars collide as we fight.
Among the far outreaches of the sky.

Solar winds are phasing.
As we forge ahead.
Astral fires are blazing.
Lighting up the path.

Hearts are racing, battle weary.
Plans are changing with the tide.
One man army, winning clearly.
His human nature must survive.

Like oceans rising, waves of blood consume.

Light the sky with explosions.
To blind the enemy's eyes.

To tear a heart out, there's no greater spoil.

Fight with utter devotion.
This war will never retire.

Scorched as time keeps on fading.
Eternal soldiers of dawn.

Gaze upon.
Ravished land.
Stoke the fire.
Coarse black sand.

The shattered remains of stars surround us.
And wave after wave of planets fall prey to this tragedy.
There must be a way out of this constant hateful design.
