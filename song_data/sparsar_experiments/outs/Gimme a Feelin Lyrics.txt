Gimme a Feelin Lyrics
by Ace Frehley.

When I see you it's such a reaction.
And Baby, you got what it takes to jangle my brain.
Now you're looking so good.
And you're such an attraction.
And I just wanna celebrate...celebrate....

You gimme a feelin' because you're on my mind.
And I start believing until the end of time.
Well, all I know I can sleep because I'm thinking ‘bout you.
And all I know and every day you drive me so crazy.

When I'm close to you, girl.
You're so contagious.
Now I'm looking at you.
I know that you're the one.
And Baby, everything about you is so outrageous.
And I just wanna celebrate...celebrate....

Lead break....

When I'm playing with you there's a chemical reaction.
And everything about you has gone to my soul...Oh, Yeah!
And Baby, I just wanna.
celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate....

You gimme a...gimme a...you gimme a....
You gimme a feelin' because you're on my mind, Oh, yeah!
And I start believing until the end of time.
Well, all I know I can't sleep because I'm thinking ‘bout you.
And all I know and every day you drive me so crazy, crazy.
You drive me fucking nuts!
