Living it up Lyrics
by VonBock.


I'm living it up.
Coasting on a hundred thousand dollars, all these ladies always.
Giving it up.
When they see the money, cars and clothes, they be always.
Switching it up.
Changing up they attitudes, tryna get a badder dude.
I'm living it up.
I'm living it up.
Living it up.
I'm living it up.

Times changed, a little bit like these tables do.
Reservation for four, sitting down to plated food.
I paint the check, and I front the bill.
I swipe the card, for that coupe de ville.

That's pimp shit, when your making money, really come so easy.
Another sunset view on a cali beach, tryna unscuff Yeezy's.
Shoe blue, and that money sticky.
Roll around with that strong team, that strong team got the honnies cliquey.

I lift weight, never checking into gyms though.
I shift states, never catch me out when that winds low.
I ride clean and I ride slow, windows cracked with that Hydro.
Shades up all on this faces, hiding out 'til that green grow, VonBock.

Aye, one time for that hard work.
Two times for that over due, Three times for this new jerk.
I've earned it all and I can act according.
When I'm checking in you better get recording.
I make moves, these lanes supporting.
Top flight, I just get to boarding.
Whipping round it that old school.
Tent high but these windows down.
While the people wanna see these jewels.
Hundred man and I'm self made.
I'm loyal too, ain't shit change.
Know the hommies to and they back the game.
Want to paint the picture they bring the frame.

I'm living it up.
Flying through the country, different studio I'm working always.
Giving it up.
They're wondering when I'm ever gonna stop.
I just tell I'm.
