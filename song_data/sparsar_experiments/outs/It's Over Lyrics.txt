It's Over Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

Didn't wanna live without you, I died everyday without you.
Over and over I kept playin it back and forth inside my head.
The day that we walked without tryin to even work it out so many things I.
wanna say to you but I'm glad it's over now.

Thought it'd be possible but somehow I let it go.
You held me down for too long.
I finally got the weight off of me.

It's over, I'm thankful there are no more sleepless nights.
It's over, I'm done cryin I'm waving heartache goodbye.
And I knew it was bound to happen, but rest assured that I'm a be alright.
It's over no denyin, no lyin to myself that it's over.

I coulda spent more time with you but I rather hang, enjoyin games.
Chasin dames, that'll never be you, damn man I'm missin my boo.
And I don't know if I'm gonna ever be the same, tell me baby....

Thought it'd be possible but somehow I let it go.
You held me down for too long.
I finally got the weight off of me.

It's over, I'm thankful there are no more sleepless nights.
It's over, I'm done cryin I'm waving heartache goodbye.
And I knew it was bound to happen, but rest assured that I'm a be alright.
It's over no denyin, no lyin to myself that it's over.

Don't think you got what it takes to be with someone like me.
You can't handle a real woman, I think we're better off bein friends.
yes, friends....

Baby, there's gotta be a road that leads me back to your heart.
I know it's my fault but baby don't you walk away.

It's over, I'm thankful there are no more sleepless nights.
It's over, I'm done cryin I'm waving heartache goodbye.
And I knew it was bound to happen, but rest assured that I'm a be alright.
It's over no denyin, no lyin to myself that it's over.
