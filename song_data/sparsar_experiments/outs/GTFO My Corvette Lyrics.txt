GTFO My Corvette Lyrics
by X Blake Freeman X.


Get the.
Get the - get the.
X Blake Freeman X.
Get the fuck out.

Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Gotta million different reasons that I could be upset.
So get the fuck out my Corvette.

Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Gotta million different reasons that I could be upset.
So get the fuck out my Corvette.

Listen to me when I speak.
Pay attention or leave.
Tired of the games, tired of the lies.
Bout to kick you outta' my seat.
You been bullshittin' me all night.
When that pussy ain't worth the fight.
Think I won't make you walk?
Lead me on and I might.
Google who I am, you're not my only option.
I hit the brakes, unlocked the door.
That bitch can start walkin'.

Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Gotta million different reasons that I could be upset.
So get the fuck out my Corvette.

Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Gotta million different reasons that I could be upset.
So get the fuck out my Corvette.

Breakdown.
Get the.
Fuck out.
My Corvette.
Get the fuck out my Corvette.

That Prince song said slow down but I can't get any slower.
Cops pullin' over that Corvette cause she kissin' on my shoulders.
I'm a little red, from that pre-head, before I came over.
That said bein' horny is like bein' drunk so with her I'm never sober.
We been talkin' for forever, you know what I wanna do.
Talkin' up that big game but you're never in the mood.
I'm startin' to lose my patience, I guess I'll make the move.
You still gimme that red light, now I don't trust two.

Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Gotta million different reasons that I could be upset.
So get the fuck out my Corvette.

Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Get the fuck out my Corvette.
Gotta million different reasons that I could be upset.
So get the fuck out my Corvette.

Get out.
