Could've Been You Lyrics
by 3LW.

Don'T even try to step to me now 
When, I was feel'n you you gave me thumbs down. 
You. Had your other woman 
You said that I was tripp'n 
But. Now you see me with them. 
And now you see who's tripp'n. What 
You know what I'm talkin' about. So 
Stick your tongue back in your mouth and go 
You, can't come back in my house. 
And! No! Don'T try to step to me when you see me out 
 
It could've been you 
The, one that I was givin' my love to 
Back. Then you knew I was into you 
And now. You can't believe that I'm over you 
Goodbye to you, 
 
It could've, been you 
The, one that I was givin' my love to 
Back. Then you knew I was into you 
And now. You can't believe that I'm over you 
Goodbye to you 
It, could of been you 
 
So. How are your boys now 
When? It was me and you that was all you was about 
When I needed you. You had things to do, 
But that Ishh is cool cause. The jokes on you now 
There's, nothing. You could say to me so go 
You, thought that you could play wit me. Oh no 
Somebody is just checkin for me and so 
You ain't, nothing but some suckers to me. 
 
It could've, been you 
The, one that I was givin' my love to 
Back. Then you knew I was into you 
And now. You can't believe that I'm over you 
Goodbye to you, 
 
It could've, been you 
The, one that I was givin' my love to 
Back. Then you knew I was into you 
And now. You can't believe that I'm over you 
Goodbye to you, 
 
It could've, been you 
The, one that I was givin' my love to 
Back. Then you knew I was into you 
And now. You can't believe that I'm over you 
Goodbye to you, 
 
It, could of been you 
The, one that I was givin' my love to 
Back. Then you knew I was into you 
And now. You can't believe that I'm over you 
Goodbye to you 
It, could of been you 
 
Break It Down. 
Oh! Oh oh 
Say! Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh-,
