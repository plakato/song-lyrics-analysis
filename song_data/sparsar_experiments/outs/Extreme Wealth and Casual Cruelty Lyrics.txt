Extreme Wealth and Casual Cruelty Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


A ghost by any other name.
She's just a frozen satellite.
She'll close her mouth and kiss with her eyes.
A rose just goes insane.
She spoke soft prose in Catalan.
But goes further south when she speaks her mind.

If we were just strangers then we would fall in love again.
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty.
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me.
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty.

A ghost that creeps around.
A crystal surface underground.
A light shows flowers crushed inside.
At most the blooms get high.
And stay there frozen underground.
But she's a ghost that smell like a rose.

If we were just strangers then we would fall in love again.
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty.
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me.
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty.

If we were just strangers then we would fall in love again.
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty.
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me.
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty.
