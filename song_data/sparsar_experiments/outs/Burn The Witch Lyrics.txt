Burn The Witch Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


Holding hands.
Skipping like a stone.
On our way.
To see what we have done.
The first to speak.
Is the first to lie.
The children cross.
Their hearts &amp; hope to die.

Bite your tongue.
Swear to keep your mouth shut.

Ask yourself.
Will I burn in Hell?
Then write it down.
&amp; cast it in the well.
There they are.
The mob it cries for blood.
To twist the tale.
Into fire wood.
Fan the flames.
With a little lie.
Then turn your cheek.
Until the fire dies.
The skin it peels.
Like the truth, away.
What it was.
I will never say.

Bite your tongue, swear to keep.
Keep your mouth shut.
Make up something.
Make up something good.
Holding hands.
Skipping like a stone.
Burn the witch.
Burn to ash &amp; bone.
