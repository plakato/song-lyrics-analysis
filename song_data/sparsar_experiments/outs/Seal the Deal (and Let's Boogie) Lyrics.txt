Seal the Deal (and Let's Boogie) Lyrics
by Volbeat.


Sold my soul and signed my name in blood.
Stole it back, now praying in the dark.
Fooled the Devil, begging for a fight.
Count the dollars, make your bet tonight.

Feel strong like an oiled machine, all the anger boils within.
Move it, give in, the high rollers are in.

I get groovy now turn it on and fight.
Seal the Deal, and let's boogie for a while.
Let's get groovy, burning out with rage.
Seal the Deal, and let's do it all again.

Knuckles crushed, my eyes no longer see.
I paid the price, and fed the family.

Sing hallelujah, the devil in disguise.
There'll be no pearly gates, so stand up for yourself this time.
Fight for honour, let no one drag you down no more.
Be your own man, with blood, sweat, tears you fall.
