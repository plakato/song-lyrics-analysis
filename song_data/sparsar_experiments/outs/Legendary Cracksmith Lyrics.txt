Legendary Cracksmith Lyrics
by Yung Neptune (AKA YUNG JZ7).


Coughin up split, spliffs 
So I go and spit shit 
, 
Bars 

ALl, my haters rap off beat 
Never miss a measure, no receipt, 
Purchasin bars, but I won't eat 
 
Regurgitate and infiltrate the masses 
Wearing a gown in a town full of clowns, 
In gas masks-s. I am a 
Fast lasso pullin in the girly 
And, given it like a patho- 
 
Logically. You see it's apparitions made of 
Me when I step into the 
Ocean shrink into a sea-man 
I, don't give a gosh darn 
Im the fucking hoover dam 
Stop, it 
 
Stop inferior flows, beanin 

Crises christ is a bias for 
Most. But to me just an alias
