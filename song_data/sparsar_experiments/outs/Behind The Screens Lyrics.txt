Behind The Screens Lyrics
by 4th25.


I've been around the block.
I've seen whats happening.
This is just a game to some of you.
Best the rest of us are not laughin.

Cause to me my lifes worth more.
Than just part of your fraction.
When divided represents.
The number of us killed in action.

Thought I could trust those in charge.
Look at me now im laughin.
Think its funny how you keep fuckin up.
And want me to respect you.

Fuck the rank on your collar.
That don't mean shit.
Even if you got 4 stars on em.
You still a bitch.

Got out here like slaves.
Fresh of the ship.
Where you would see us pick your cotton.
And get our ass whipped.

Cause right now.
That's whats happenin and yall ain't doin shit.
But tyin my hands to my ankles.
Telling me stop Michael vick.

And could you please explain to me.
What is hostile intent.
And why you gave me a mouthful of water.
And complain when I spit.

No I ain't mad im a soldier.
Ill kill for my country.
Im only pissed.
Cause you brought me all the way out here just to fuck me.

Behind the screens in this theatre.
It's a whole lot of issues.
And it's a lotta balls dropped.
That eventually kill us.

And for some.
That's the reason that yalls familys now miss you.
All cause one mofuckers out here.
Playin with continues.

But this game has no restarts.
Soon as death comes to get you.
Ain't no cheat codes for life here.
Just the one god gives you.

But they got us out here like naw.
Death won't get you.
But explain that to the families.
Of the soldiers lives yall ruined.

Yall can't have a clue of.
The fuck yall doin.
As many soldiers lives.
As your decisions have ruined.

Got us out here getting fucked up.
That's all we doin.
While yall fly around with yalls cape on.
Pretendin yall not stupid.

But I've seen too many car bombs.
We are not allowed to shoot at.
Come from the rear of a convoy.
Now how the fuck we letm do that.

Cause in my mind.
Wouldn't no car ride that close.
If at all times im authorized.
To exercise my bolt.

And I've been thru yalls AO.
I've seen how yall work it.
Tahoe or suburban.
For every civilian there workin.

But its too much.
For an 1114 here am I not worth it.
Or is it ok to send me to war.
With something that's not workin.

And yall rewardin this country.
Though the violence ain't stopped.
Feedin the same fuckers killen us.
And that's pissin me off.

No I ain't come here to be no target.
But that's what you make me.
And im just wonderin when yall gone let me.
Take this weapon off safety.

Probably should of kept this to myself.
But my conscious won't see it.
So I can pull no punches.
I can only tell it how I see it.

And everything from my perspective.
Is definitely warped.
And why the fuck we train soldiers.
To let politicians fight wars.

And if the medias gon be here.
Letme see the truth.
Don't ask soldiers to pose.
And pretend wars cute.

And fuckem if they don't understand.
The job we are here to do.
This is war and people will die.
Innocent ones to.

And the only reason we are here.
Is cause diplomacy failed.
And to the day we redeployed.
We should have unleashed hell.

But yall talk a lot more shit.
Than yall would ever commit.
Telling me wave and be nice.
Shit im trying to grab my dick.

And walk this country like im god.
Instead you made me a bitch.
And now this country think im soft.
And they are killin us quick.

I know you gotta see this is broke.
Then why the fuck it ain't fixed.
Cause I'd a never left home.
If you'd a told me you was cutting my wrists.
