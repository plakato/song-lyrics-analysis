Misogyny Lyrics
by Rusty.

He veers she fears, he's comin' home to box her ears, 
 
Upside-down, 
 
Welfare takes care of all the women in his lair 
 
Upside-down 
 
And. If you ask the cruellest, soul, soul, 
 
You can't expect him to be home, be home. 
 
You'll always ask for one more: try. Try 
 
You'll always give him one more.. 
 
Heee-yeah Heee-yeah 
 
She scrubs. He comes. She holds it in herself. For months, 
, 
Upside-down, 
, 
He's bored she scored. The blade has got a life. That'S torn 
 
Upside-down, 
 
And. If you ask the cruellest, soul, soul, 
 
You can't expect him to be home, be home. 
 
You'll always ask for one more: try. Try 
 
You'll, always give him one more 
, 
Heee-yeah, Heee-yeah, 
 
His, bad luck, man, it sucks! She'S been impressed, who gives a fuck 
 
Upside-down 
 
She, tired, growing, tired he's gon na rip her up inside 
 
Upside-down 
 
And. If you ask the cruellest souls soul, 
 
You can't expect him to be home, be home. 
 
You'll always ask for one more. Try try 
 
You'll, always give him one more 
 
Heee-yeah Heee-yeah Heee-yeah Heee-yeah 
 
Upside-down, 
 
And. If you ask the cruellest, soul, soul, 
 
You can't expect him to be home, be home. 
 
He'll always ask for one more. Try. Try 
 
He'll always give you one more. Try, try 
 
You'll, always give him one more ..., 
 
Heee-yeah, Heee-yeah, Heee-yeah Heee-yeah
