Be Neon With Me Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

We're doomed to kiss each other while we.
Lay in bed discovering.
What it's like to eat lead.
And the sickness that can come from it.
The radiator dries your mouth out, oh my word.
You were a songbird but your songs were a.
Cannon that shoots buildings.
What habitat will you live in? Well, I won't know.
Because I won't see you.

Take the skin from our hands.
Ethan stretched it across the river, we will walk.
To our targets, our own desperate bodies.
