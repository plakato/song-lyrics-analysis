Lost The Way Lyrics
by XCEP.


Time is running out.
What are we about?
Is the question now.
Can't answer why like we answer how.
Can't answer why like we answer how.
We have no guts to have some doubts.
Cause the doubts are evil.
The so called evil, why?
We complicate the ego.
We're just some people.
All the humans equal.

You see? Everything happens for a reason.
And nothing is static we all change with the seasons.
And nobody's perfect, not the king nor the servant.
Always keep in mind; it's the same air they be breathing.
We all even and we all got the same flaws.
It's all nature we all under the same law.
And when it gon end us up we gon be under the same claws.
It's bigger than us! Why are we acting like the frame's small.
No, we ain't gon last for long in here.
And don't you see it? it's so clear that the time is near.
And since we came here we've brought nothing but fear.
Enslaving and killing each other like we don't even care.
About the whole thing that's above the whole thing that made us.
The evil rises from inside when we crave lust.
Unity and ain't nobody above.
Maybe we have it all but we still lacking that love.
