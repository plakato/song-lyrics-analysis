As Stars Fall Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


One morning over the mountains, oh, the sun did rise.
But it did not dim the stars in the sky.
And in awe I tarried to watch it, troubled as I go.
But this feeling won't last long, I know.
Through daylight over the mountains all the stars shone bright.
I watched as planets fell from the sky.
And I felt it moving above me, something was now right.
This world has changed and set me alight.

I can see the dawning.
Stars rise up, surrounding.
Beautiful, heavenly light.
Don't forget this calling.
Someday it will find me.
And falling stars will carry me high.

So what was done had just begun.
On the horizon we saw a new sun.
A dawn of time for all who see.
As falling stars descended.
And through the night, the stars will shine.
A never-ending day would be our lives.
A dawn of truth for all who see.
As setting suns descended.

On that evening, facing the mountains, a setting sun would die.
And it shone like golden fire in the sky.
So in awe, I tarried to watch it, christened by its glow.
But it will return tomorrow, i know.
