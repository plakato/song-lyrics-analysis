At Large Lyrics
by VI Seconds.

Im livin life at large.
Always runnin from the law.
People askin' the charge.
Well its cause.
Well its cause.
I'm killin these niggas.
Lawd..

Behold, You barin witness to greatness.
Givin these niggas whippins, you'd swear im runnin a slave ship.
I suggest you don't say shit in provacative tones.
Thinkin i'm one to play with, i'll be stompin ya soul.
Behold, I'm the coldest thang every season.
Known for lyrics and loyalty, never been into treason.
Come in the game creepin, with shit never before seen.
From the box seat, snipin' everyone with floor seats.
In other words everybody with some fame's.
Gonna be a name on a body decorating my floor see.
And as for love, thats somethin im lookin past, honey.
Nothin last forever even Wayne wants off of cash money.
No matter the struggle, to be heard is the mission.
I was one they would ignore like terms and conditions.
But I'm getting on now, respect and get it straight.
I'm all you're gonna see like a black eye on a pretty face.

Killin em, like headshots or knee slappers.
Give me more artists, we dont need rappers.
Give me more visionaries, we don't need trappers.
Give me more real, we don't need actors.
Take more bullets out of bodies of the innocent.
Take jobs from officers using it to be militant.
Stop using your badge as a reason to shoot a black mag.
Stop turning lives into rest in peace hash tags.
It's like the wicked witch passed the poison apple round.
Turnin the world from home into nothin but a battleground.
Chivalry is thirst, Peace is.
considered boring.
If it ain't on worldstar the shits considered corny.
Fuck rap, and any nigga you a fan of.
9 times out of 10 won't none of these niggas stand up.
It's for that reason I ain't feelin these niggas.
Darren Wilson, with no repercussion, killin these niggas.
