Born Bad Lyrics
by Voltaire.

They say the day.
That I was born.
It rained here.
And yet it was the best.
Day of your life.
And who would ever dream.
A child sweet as I seem.
Would be the source of.
So much pain and strife.

Every time I tried.
To take the high road.
Something deep inside me.
Dragged me down.
Wherever I appear.
Came hate, despair and fear.
Seems trouble always.
Followed me around.

Say it's not too late for.
You to hold me.
You were always there.
When times were bad.
And they're so bad.
The love you gave to me.
So unconditionally.
So sad, so sad.
Born bad.

Nary have I written you.
A letter.
Hardly have I called.
Lest things were bad.
And all those I called friends.
Are all gone in the end.
In truth you were the best.
I ever had.
Mama, is it too late.
For you to hold me?
You were always there.
When times were bad.
And they're so bad.
The love you gave to me.
So unconditionally.
So sad, so sad.
Born bad.

I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
I'm not nearly yet.
No! No!
