Mirage Lyrics
by Twitch.


Free your mind....
I got this.

I'm from the era of the soulless.
Teens growing up goalless.
So we find comfort in weed, pills and Coronas.
Screaming fuck friends but point the finger at loners.
Gold chain, bonus, I don't mind me some owners.
My home is, wherever my particular zone is.
I smoke with my Patronus.
Never stress the opponents.
Niggas is rodents, kill 'em, savour the moments.
Here's my condolence, toast to my purple solvents.

As days go by.
We pay no mind, but.
For some reason it done played on mine.
My teacher wished that I just stayed on time, but.
I'm sorry Miss I gotta save mankind.

As I light this blunt.
All this bullshits coming to the front.
'Cos these serpents wearing clothes.
And they sided with the hoes.
That's why I be with my niggas from the jump.

Where my trill bitches?
And where's the real niggas?
Show them mahfuckas we ain't gotta kill niggas.

You're too focused on Zimmerman, boy I warned ya.
Don't you know the state just admitted to killing Dorner?
I ain't into politics, I just thought to inform ya.
But still I'd rather swap LDN for some California.
Bad B, without T, she wouldn't be.
Slow down girl, you almost look good as me.
We would talk about the mind, the pineal and the chi.
Watch the view under the pine, she roll me a lil' tree, wait.

Excuse my mirage, we gotta dream large.
'Cos I ain't tryna be a bonus for the judge and the sarge.
It's hot as hell out here, Satan in charge.
Niggas wanna be in Paris, without earning fromage.
