Ballin' is a Habit Lyrics
by 50/50 Twin.


Balling is a habit over here at Paid In Full 
Want you to know that g'yeah 
 
Balling is a habit like Jordan, Bird and Magic 
My life is fantastic, immaculate extravagant 
Got, a high rise and a bachelor pad rims tumble like acrobats, 
A buck sixty where the Dash is at platinum card no maxing that 
 
50/50 Twin 
Balling is a habit. Baby 
Chinchilla makes my jackets baby 
I, don't wan na get cash from rapping crazy, 
I'm gutter. I grind: stop acting crazy 
Capping on wax ain't. Really me 
Ten G's a day. That'S a brilliant week: 
Big faces breeder thee, 
Caugh nine packs. I sneeze a ki 
Roll through Panama, floss, the Benz 
Wipe, my Timberland's off with ten's 
50/50, the Lil' Twin 
Leave, the rap game, with a flawless win, 
Take a flight in a G-4-7 
Spend the night. In a East Coast setting 
I'm so hot dog, I need more relish. 
2004 watch B.C. fetish, 
 
Paul Wall 
When. My car is changing speed, 
I'm, like Tarzan, swanging, through trees, 
It's so much ice in my mouth 
When. I take a deep breath. I get brain freeze. 
Millionaires wan na hang with me
