Denver Lyrics
by Swindle.


I only play this for Denver you know.
I don't never play this anywhere else but Denver just so you know.

D E N V E R 12.

To me dubstep always represented family.
That was the vibe I wanted to bring back to Denver.
The people here really seem to appreciate.
The vibe and the just the sound system culture.
The feeling of everyone coming from different places in life.
Different parts of town.
But coming for one night to stand in front of one DJ.
And get moved in the same way.
You know music has a tendency of bringing people together.
So mission means moving people through sound on hype.
It's not just a movement it's a lifestyle.
Endeavour the fans don't break the culture salvation.
More importantly the artist who have helped make this.
Music and sound something special.
