Don't Let Me Drown Lyrics
by 3 Shades of Blue.


It began on a day in December.
Lying in a basket of bread.
Life can try to beat it out of him.
Dropping him high, he's trying to swim.
But mother knows she won't relent.
Yea I said mother knows she won't relent.

There a dark, cold spirit in the water.
Beating on the innocent wounds.
Maybe life can see through eyes of the King.
But then again maybe its not.
Yea I said then again maybe its not.

Don't let me drown.
Cuz I've been waiting for too long.
Run on my sister and go tell my father I'm.
Coming home.

There are thousands of voices in my head.
Telling me that I have lost.
How about standing up for what we believe in.
Then drowning in the cause.

Don't let me drown.
Cuz I've been waiting for too long.
Run on my sister and go tell my father I'm.
Coming home.

It began on a day in December.
Lying in a basket of bread.
Life can try to beat it out of him.
Dropping him high, he trying to swim.
But mother knows she won't relent.
