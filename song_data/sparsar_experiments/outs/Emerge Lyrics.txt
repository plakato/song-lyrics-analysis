Emerge Lyrics

WordPlay T.JAY &amp; Samantha Erickson.
I've walked through the fire, swam through the rain.
I've wrestled the storm, took all of the pain.
Missed all of the sunshine and gave you the reigns.
I'm never the same.
I'm emerging again.

Falling from the ashes right.
Rain drops on my glass at night.
The waves turn I hear the tides.
Throw away my foolish pride.
I used to contemplate suicide, Frankenstein I'm too a live.
Subject to my sentence and my only verb is do or die.
Call me square up root your ties,.
grounded now and I'm due to fly.
Every day that they that they scrutinized I proved them wrong I do oblige.
Hmm, make the world to my liking.
Now the powers in my writing, where's the powder now I'm fighting.
There's no gods if I'm a Titan.
put me on I keep enlightening.
Mouth guard they keep on biting,.
not coming down I'm gliding.

They try to speed me up but I'm riding slow, riding slow.
They wanna keep me down but I gotta grow, gotta grow.
I'm riding way to high I'm never low, never low.
Somebody lit the fuse I'm bout to blow, there he goes.

I can never let her see me cry.
I'm her strength but still I'm human right?
I'm feeling like a Jedi Knight.
I only do leave you to try.
My passion what I utilize, can't dog me out I euthanize.
Your math is wrong no proof in lies, I guess you wear a true disguise.
I'm cool with being myself.
Fan me out don't need the wealth,.
house of cards and still I dealt.
Float up top, I must be kelp. Never booked you must be shelved.
I'm too cold to see me melt, acting out now bring my belt.
Cause I'm winning all the titles, and I dance on words recital.
Pick your train up way too bridal and I'm on the drums like tribal.
