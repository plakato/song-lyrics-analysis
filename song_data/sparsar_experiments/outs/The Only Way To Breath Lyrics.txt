The Only Way To Breath Lyrics
by Quadruple_A.

I'M Not Afraid To Hide My Dreams
I'm, Not Gon na Stop Dreaming
Cause. I Have No Life
And. This Is The Only Way
To Me
To Breath

So, I'm Not Gon na Runway
Cause I've To Hold On
Cause I've To Be Strong
To Turn It Real

So
I'm, Not Afraid
I'm, Not Afraid
Yeah
I'm, Not Afraid
I'm, Not Afraid

Cause. This. The Only Way
To Me
To Breath
