If it Ain't Rough it Ain't Right Lyrics
by 3rd Eye.

What's up?
How you feelin?
Yeah-yeah.
3rd Eye.
Guess who?

Come on!

What you say, what you say?
You know the format, baby.

I wanna hear some 3rd Eye.

3rd Eye &amp; Troo Kula.
Now if it ain't rough, it ain't right.
If it ain't rugged.
If it ain't rough, it ain't right.
If it ain't wicked.

Why you frontin, you only wanna rock a party.
Why you frontin, you ain't really rugged and rough.
Why you frontin, you ain't down to shoot nobody.
Why you frontin, I can see your blind man's bluff.
So why you frontin, baby, I know you better.
You kick your ruffneck slang, but I know better.
That's dead to me, in '94 we got the remedy.
Best remember we, I burn any when you're 70.
And I'll be damned if my flavor's not the flim-flam.
I been hardcore before you ever learned to -.
Don't play me, you wanna fake the funk, but I see through that.
Now you wanna come back hard, but you can't do that.
Now who that, tryin to cross back, boy, you blew that.
Now your shit is wack, ain't got no love from your crew, black.
You shoulda knew: once you crossed over you was through.
You made your mad dash for cash, now your ass is trash.
I'm not goin for it, now you're rough again.
Fake rappers switchin back and forth, I had enough of them.
1994 it's time to pull your card, you ain't really hardcore.
Yeah, so what you play hard for?

If it ain't rough, it ain't right.
If it ain't rugged.
If it ain't rough, it ain't right.
If it ain't wicked.
If it ain't rough, it ain't right.
If it ain't rugged.
If it ain't rough, it ain't right.
If it ain't wicked.

You only wanna rock a party.
You ain't really rugged and rough.
You ain't down to shoot nobody.
I can see your blind man's bluff.
Guess who's back up on the block? What?
Rippin up the spot while you're frontin what you're not.
Creep, I never sleep, cause I'm livin too deep.
I reap what I sow and I sow what I reap.
Yes, it's the Kula and the West, did you see that?
Time to manifest '94, and you say 'who dat?'.
Step into the back cause they lack where we at.
Schoolin the class is the fella to the track.
Man, do you really understand, do you know the program?
You take your daily dips in the quicksand.
Why'd you say that your skit is mad tight.
With the hype type of flavor the ghetto kids like.
With the murder and the guns and the cocaine runs.
Wake up, wake up, cause you're dyin by the tons.
You think you're tough, kid, but that's a bluff, kid.
Never did a bid, kid, so what you want, kid?

You only wanna rock a party.
You ain't really rugged and rough.
You ain't down to shoot nobody.
I can see your blind man's bluff.

BREAK.

When it comes to Eye, for the '94, man.
Melt down the hollow points and dismantle the guns.
Dilute the mishaps, livin in the bad rap.
Talkin 'bout they got gats when it ain't like that.
Now who's that claimin that they fat and all that.
Get prepared to go to war, black, you know the format.
And we raw, baby paw, when we be buildin.
I'm skilled when I represent the ghetto children.
We just bring it on back, oh yes, indeed.
You wanna lick shots on my crops and my seeds.
Cease that, black, time to get back this time, aight.
Cause if it ain't rough, it ain't right.
And if it ain't right, it ain't wicked.
And if it ain't wicked, you can kick it.
To the curb, that's my word.
Offending comin from the 3rd Eye.
Put your boots on, troop, we're goin huntin.
MC's that be frontin.
