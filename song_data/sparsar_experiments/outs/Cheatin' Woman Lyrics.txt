Cheatin' Woman Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.


Cheating woman make you crazy.
Cheating woman make you a fool.
She'll leave your heart so lonely.
Brother there's nothing you can do.
Well I can't stand the pain no more.
She don't want my love for sure.
She don't even want poor me.
Knocking on her front door.
Why did you make me love you sister.
When you knew you was untrue.
You loved every man with pants on.
Yes a dozen to you is too few.
I'm gonna shoot you and end your world.
Then you won't bother poor me.
You won't bother poor me no longer.
Cheating woman - going to shoot you.
Oh woman why you do me.
Oh Lord the way you do.
I done everything I can baby.
Seems like nothing reaches you.
I'm gonna get that pistol gal.
I'm gonna shoot you and all your pals.
You ain't going to bother poor me.
You won't bother poor me no longer.
