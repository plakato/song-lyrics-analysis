Alone Together Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

Alone, together
Above the crowd
Beyond, the world
We're not too proud to cling together
We're strong. As long as we're together

Alone, together
The, blinding rain
The starless night
Was, not in vain
For we're together
And. What is there to fear together? 

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love. Can be
For we can weather the great unknown
If, we're alone together
Together
Together
If, we're alone together
