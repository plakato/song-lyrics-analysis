Got It Bad Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.

Got me on heaven, fading.
We all shine like we're old for the first time.
We gotta live to be forgotten.
We all cry when we're high for the last time.

What will become of our girls in the park.
They still jumping and screaming.
All of the broken hearts.
We're what they got, it's all we need.
We come high tonight and come.

We got it bad and we know we'll never make it.
We getting home but we never would have made it, yeah.
We started fast but we couldn't throw the punches.
It's only calm if you know you lost it.

Got me on heaven, fading.
We all lose with the rise of the new think.
We are a deviant.
We all turn when we cut from the last scene.

What will become of all of our kings and the queens.
When they move like the reason now.
We'll never go back now again.
We're what they got, it's all we need.
We come high tonight and come.

We got it bad and we know we'll never make it.
We getting home but we never would have made it, yeah.
We started fast but we couldn't throw the punches.
It's only calm if you know you lost it.

Time keeps dragging you down but you got it.
Time keeps dragging you down but you got it.
Time keeps dragging you down but you got it.
Time keeps dragging you down but you got it bad.

instrumental break.

We got it bad and we know we'll never make it.
We getting home but we never would have made it, yeah.
We started fast but we couldn't throw the punches.
It's only calm if you know you lost it.

Time keeps dragging you down but you got it.
Time keeps dragging you down but you got it.
Time keeps dragging you down but you got it bad.
