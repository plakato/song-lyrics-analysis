American Idiot Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.

I wan na listen to Green day 
 
Don't wan na be an American idiot. 
Don'T want a nation under the new media 
And. Can you hear the sound of hysteria 
The subliminal mind fuck America, 
 
Welcome to a new kind of tension all across the alien nation? 
Where everything isn't meant to be okay, 
Television's dream of tomorrow we're not the ones you're meant to follow. 
For, that's enough to argue 
 
Well, maybe I'm the faggot America 
I'm, not a part of a red-neck agenda. 
Now everybody do the propaganda 
And sing along to the age of paranoia, 
 
Welcome to a new kind of tension all across the alien nation. 
Where everything isn't meant to be okay, 
Television's dream of tomorrow we're not the ones you're meant to follow 
For. That'S enough. To argue 
, 
Don't wan na be an American idiot. 
Don'T want a nation controlled by the media, 
Information the age of hysteria, 
_It's, going out to idiot America_ 
 
Welcome to a new kind of tension all across the alien nation. 
Where everything isn't meant to be okay, 
Television's dream of tomorrow we're not the ones you're meant to follow. 
For, that's enough to argue
