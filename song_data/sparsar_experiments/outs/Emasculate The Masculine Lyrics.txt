Emasculate The Masculine Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

This could be the sound of me tearing.
Into your flesh from a distance.
Opening fresh wounds.
For a peak.

And this could be the sound of me breaking.
Into your room late at night.
Slitting your throat.
And cutting off your dick.

Cause everyone I know.
Is too comfortable with thier lives.
To ever be a part of change.

And everyone I know.
Is leaving for the weekend.
With tickets to the game.
Everybody sounds the same.

All dirty.
All dirty.

La la la la la la la.
