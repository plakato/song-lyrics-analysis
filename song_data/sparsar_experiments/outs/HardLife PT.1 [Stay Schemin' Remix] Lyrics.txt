HardLife PT.1 [Stay Schemin' Remix] Lyrics
by Yung Breezy.


Yea, Breezy.
ODT, ODT.
Uhh.

Girls now a days show show to much skin.
Just to get a dumb boys attention.
Pics makin' him thirsty soakin' up the whole ocean.
His mom told him she was just a ho wantin' to trap him.
5 weeks later girl is braggin' bout how she done smashed him.
9 months later a child is born the boy feelin' stupid wishin' he could go back.
and listen.
Only 15 he don't know how to be a daddy yet.
He was only 5 when his broke ass daddy left.
He gotta lil son now he needed that easy money so he became a theft.
Always out on the block up to no good.
He 18 now still livin' in the good.
Lil son 3 now watchin mommy smash strange niggas for some money.
But aye thats the only way she knew how to put food in his tummy.
He don't be seein' daddy no more cause daddy out sellin' some punani.
Mommy be gettin F'd up.
Daddy be gettin' shot up.
And his granny is so fed up.
I feel sorry for that lil boy cause he only 3 and his life already F'd up.
