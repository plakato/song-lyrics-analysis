Boat Song Lyrics
by Woodkid.


We packed our bags and said farewell.
Untied our knot and raised the sail.
We threw our hearts into the sea.
Forgot all of our memories.

The wind was sweet and smelled of home.
The sea was rough and felt unknown.
Escaping shores of lunacy.
Dawn light, twilight, infinity.

Can we keep our bearing straight.
Or will we be blown off course.
Are we instruments of fate?
Or do we really have a choice?

A voice whispers in the gales.
Like in the songs and childhood tales.
Where krakens raging in the sea.
Crack ships into a million pieces.

We threw our hearts into the sea.
Forgot all of our memories.
