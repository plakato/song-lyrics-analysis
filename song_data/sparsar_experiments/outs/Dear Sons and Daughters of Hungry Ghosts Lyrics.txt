Dear Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

I got a hand.
So I got a fist.
So I got a plan.
It's the best that I can do.
Now we'll say, It's in God's hands.
But God doesn't always have the best goddamn plans, does he?
I ain't quite the beauty.
Pulls out two guns and shoots at the pretty, pretty view.
I gotta keep thinking things, hunters and kings to block out the view.
I gotta get a new bell to ring.
New song to sing.
A steady hand to ring.
A readiness of things I do.
I gotta get a new plan to bring to the people.
People I can trick them into thinking anything as you know.
And rust, it's just right in the light, it's gold, it's gold.
And you know I got water and holes in my hands.
I'm a digger of holes in the land, oh, holes.
And you know it's the easiest way.
And you know it's the easiest way.
And you know it's the easiest way.
So I go.

La-la-la, la-la-la.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
I got water and I got holes, oh.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
Sons and daughters of hungry ghosts, oh.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
I got water and I got holes, oh.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
The sons and daughters of hungry ghosts, oh.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
I got water and I got holes, oh.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
The sons and daughters of hungry ghosts, oh, ghosts oh.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
I got a hand.
So I got a fist.
So I got a plan.
It's the best that I can do.
Now we'll say, It's in God's hands.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
But God doesn't always have the best goddamn plans, does he?
La-la-la, la-la-la.
I can't believe in the guns, I can't believe in the view.
I sing, sing, sing, la-la-la, la-la-la.
I can't believe in those hunter and kings and you know.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
I got a new plan to bring.
I got a new song to sing and it goes.
La-la-la, la-la-la.
I got a new plan to bring.
And you know it's the easiest way.
And you know it's the easiest way.
And you know it's the easiest way.
And you know it's the easiest way.
So I go.
