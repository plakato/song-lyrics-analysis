Around My Heart Lyrics
by X.

On the golden road.
Someone carved our initials in the stone.
I dreamed of curly black hair.
When you were there.

Our first rendezvous.
Was in the devil's workshop.
Come true.
This was dirty, dark no-place.
For a beautiful face.

So why do you.
Want to throw another chain.
Around my heart.
Around my heart.
Why do you.
Want to throw another chain.
Around my heart.
Around my heart.

And even I was the winner.
Even was if it was for a little while.
You were good to me and smiled.
While my so-called friends.
Quickly turned into strangers.
To the one that I love.

So why do you.
Want to throw another chain.
Around my heart.
Around my heart.
You don't even know me.
Anyway, I'm all torn up from yesterday.

So why do you.
Want to throw another chain.
Around my heart.
Around my heart.

So why do you.
Want to throw another chain.
Around my heart.
Around my heart.
You don't even know me.
Anyway, I'm all screwed up from yesterday.

So why do you.
Want to throw another chain.
Around my heart.
Around my heart.
Why do you.
Want to throw another chain.
Around my heart.
Around my heart.
