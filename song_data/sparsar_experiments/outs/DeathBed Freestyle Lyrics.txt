DeathBed Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


I pulled up, tinted windows in the black truck.
8 niggas hoppin' out and they all masked up.
No fucks given tomorrow or yesterday.
I got a thug bitch, in purse she keep that pepper spray.
Im ?
Roll runnin' on that paper chase.
You super late.
You super fake.
I pull up they congratulate.
I'm hungry but I just ate.
So I'm picking up your plate.
Boy don't you cross that gate my dogs gon' treat you like you steak.
I'm just a nigga from the hood.
Countin' money smokin' good.
I be tourin' probably in yo hood nigga smoking good.
I'm misunderstood, but you understand.
If I fall I bounce back The rubberband man.
I burn em like a sauna I the tan man.
And if you comin' at me wrong you a Deadman.
This ain't Nintendo 64 cuz I ain't playing man.
Im cookin up, I got that method no redman.
What you sayin man, you wanna battle, punchlines I'm throwin left hands.
I been that man you ain't heard then you deaf man.
Simmie killin shit leavin beats on they death bed.
I'm the cooker of all cookers I'm a cheff man.
And you just a onlooker you ain't first hand.
I took yo bitch and gave her back by noon.
The grim reaper, street sweeper in the cut with a broom.
And if you lookin for yo bitch then she was bustin a move.
And if you lookin like a snitch my hittas bustin a tool.
I'm lowkey when I move, iont fuck with you dudes.
Pick it up and drop it off turn one into two.
Turn three into four.
I want some more.
