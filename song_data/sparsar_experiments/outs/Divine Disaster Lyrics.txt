Divine Disaster Lyrics
by XO (Producer).


Yeh-Yeh-Yeh-Yeh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh, 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, 
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh, 
Oh-oh-ooo-oooh, 
 
Forgive my sins. I had become weaker with each day. 
Temptation caught me good. She won't let go 
My innocence taken from me with each word. She say 
Walkin' back through the fire for my soul, 
 
This love. Won'T! Last us 
Divine disaster, oh-oh 
Caught out and captured by the 
Puppet master oo-oh 
This love won't last us 
Divine disaster. Oh 
Came, back to the fire for my soul, 
 
For, my soul, 
Eh-eh-eeeh 
 
Oh lord, I beg running circles in the warzone 
As. She whispers all those sweet, sweet lies 
On. My last legs almost helpless in battle alone. 
Manipulated, she controls my mind. 
 
This love, won't last us 
Divine disaster oh-oh 
Caught up and captured by the 
Puppet master oo-oh 
This love won't last us 
Divine disaster. Oh 
Walkin', back to the fire for my soul, 
 
For, my soul, 
Eh-eh-eeeh 
Eh-eh-eeeh, 
 
Think, all she said was truthful friend, 
And, all the things above this world. She did pretend 
In. All of this. She was a fake 
Afraid. The first drink that you bought. Her was a mistake: 
 
This love won't last us 
Divine disaster oh-oh 
Caught out and captured by the 
Puppet master oo-oh 
This love won't last us 
Divine disaster. Oh 
Walkin', back to the fire for my soul
