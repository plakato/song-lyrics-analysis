Misfit Lyrics
by The Undead.


Walkin' down the street.
The people that I meet.
You always f**king glare.
But you just be aware.
I ain't no f**kin' fool.
I graduated from high school.
And I held a nine-to-five job.
But I couldn't live working for some filthy rich slob.
F**king people that I see.
Always f**king staring at me.
I wonder what it is you see.
Some freak from a menagerie.
Nothing ever came to me.
But all the pain I got for free.
You wouldn't give me a hand.
But you sure gave me all of your demands.
All the other girls and boys.
Came around showing off their shiny new toys.
F**king people that I see.
Always f**king staring at me.
I wonder what it is you see.
Some freak from a menagerie.
F**king people that I see.
Always f**king staring at me.
I wonder what it is you see.
Some freak from a menagerie.
Nothing ever came to me.
But all the pain I got for free.
You wouldn't give me a hand.
But you sure gave me all of your demands.
All the other girls and boys.
Came around showing off their shiny new toys.
F**king people that I see.
Always f**king staring at me.
I wonder what it is you see.
Some freak from a menagerie.
F**king people that I see.
Always f**king laughing at me.
Well, laugh all you want, well, that's just fine.
Cause the last laugh is gonna be mine.
