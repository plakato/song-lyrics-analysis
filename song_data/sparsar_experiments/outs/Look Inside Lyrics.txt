Look Inside Lyrics
by 4hero.


Fading, is a lot of feel fading through my window, night time always makes it.
real thats the time the tears flow. think i found a way to stop the pain but.
its breaking down my soul, my soul, think i found a way to stop the rain I'm.
losing my control, got to find another way today.

Look inside your heart feel guided what they hide you'll find it.
Look inside your heart feel guided what they hide you'll find it.
Look inside your heart feel guided what they hide you'll find it.
Look inside your heart feel guided what they hide you'll find it.

Rising another day unfolds, I'm just another day old, searching every.
particle, running out of rainbows. think i found another way to stop the pain,.
to stop this pain from breaking down my soul,think i found a way to stop the.
rain I'm taking my control, got to find another way today.

Look inside your heart feel guided what they hide you'll find it.
Look inside your heart feel guided what they hide you'll find it.
Look inside your heart feel guided what they hide you'll find it.
Look inside your heart feel guided what they hide you'll find it X2.
