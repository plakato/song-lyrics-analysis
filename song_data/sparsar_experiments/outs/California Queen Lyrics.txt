California Queen Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

Slipped off into the slip stream.
She's looking for the summer dream.
Came down from the mountain.
To find another machine.
Running down all the byways.
Listen to all that she says.
Couldn't see very far.
Find out all that you are, my California queen.
Fully air-reconditioned.
Self-made man machine.
With a homemade hydroponic.
Way to find out what it means, my California queen.
Standing in front of the rainbow.
Could you tell me where do all the people go?
Rising from the mystic haze.
Standing in front of all creation.
With all their mystic ways they seem to control the days.
Somebody got to get behind it.
To find out all that it means, my California queen.
Oh, tell me what it means, my California queen.
Standing in front of the rainbow.
Could you tell me where do all the people go?
Rising from the mystic haze.
Standing in front of all creation.
