Sissy Walk Lyrics

Mc Half Mast: 
I'm rappin, I'm rappin', someone please hand me a napkin 
I like to wipe my fingers after every time. I'M snackin' 
Sucka Slim back on the mic, so let us get a crackin' 
A crackin on some Kraken 
the Cruzan or even
Captain 
Working on this case. Like my name was Bert Macklin. 
So now let me see who the culprit could be 
Pound a few drinks, and now I got ta pee 
Could someone clarify “What. The heck was in that whiskey” 
Dr. Brule, Dr. Brule
diagnose, my flow 
Is it ill in need of pills. Will it stop the show 
I, don't really care cause, I'm a doctor too 
Just sawr a dang stranger, and that stranger was you 
Haven't, been to Dave
