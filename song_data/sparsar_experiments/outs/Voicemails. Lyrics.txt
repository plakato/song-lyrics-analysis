Voicemails. Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.


Poetic words and humble gestures.
Are just baby steps to show you how I feel.
But lately I feel that it's just not enough.
Cause these three soft words seem to always come up rough.
But maybe soon, my confidence might rise.
Well, what's the point when I'm always lost in your eyes.

I love you.
Baby girl, I hope you hear the voice of this lost male.
Cause I'm trying to tell you my heart is for sale.
But honestly baby I'd give it to you for free.
Cause I wanna be the king who fights for his queen.
Just promise me you'll never, ever, ever, ever break it.
Just promise me you'll never, ever, ever, no no.

I've been running, running for so long.
But I know each path will lead me back to you.
Just be my home and shelter me from this cold.
I can't fight no more.
I can't fight no more, I can't fight no.

Beat Change.

Well baby, it's a new day.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
La La Oh.
Just tell me if you need me, just tell me if you need me and I'll be there.
Right there, right there, right there.
I wanna take you higher and higher now.
Just tell me if you need me.
Just tell me if you need me and I'll be there.
