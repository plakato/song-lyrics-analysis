Gimme Your Autograph Lyrics
by The Undead.


Gimme your autograph.
This one's gonna be your last.
Gimme your autograph.
You were my favorite star.
It blew my mind the way you played your guitar.
I followed you through every trend.
But tonight that's gonna end.
Gimme your autograph.
This one's gonna be your last.
Gimme your autograph.
I played your records through high school.
I always wanted to be like you.
They say that I'm to blame.
They say that I'm insane.
My only claim to fame was you.
I played your records through high school.
I always wanted to be like you.
They say that I'm to blame.
They say that I'm insane.
My only claim to fame.
My only claim to fame.
My only claim to fame was you.
