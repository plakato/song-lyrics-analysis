Baby
by Rufus Wainwright.

I really can't stay
I've got to go â€˜way
The evening has been
So very nice

My. Mother will start to worry
And. Father will be pacing, the floor
So really I'd better scurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink, more

The neighbors might think
Say. What'S in this drink
I wish. I knew how
To break this spell

I oughtta say no. No, no sir
At least I'm gon na say that I tried
I really can't stay
Oh, but it's cold. Outside

I simply must go
The answer is no
The. Welcome, has been
So nice and warm

My sister will be suspicious
My. Brother will be there at the door
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Well. Maybe just a cigarette more

I've got to get home
Say lend me a comb
You've really been grand
Oh, but don't you see

There's bound to be talk? Tomorrow
At least, there will be plenty implied
I, really can't stay
Oh, but baby. It'S cold outside
