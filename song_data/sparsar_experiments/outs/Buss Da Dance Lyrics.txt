Buss Da Dance Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


If you can't Stand Firm.
Inna di dance go 'ome.
Who can't whine.
Inna di dance go si downg.
Mind Mi nah back di strap.
And start show chrome.
Wave it in da air and Start buss di roun'.

If you can't Stand Firm.
Inna di dance go 'ome.
Who can't whine.
Inna di dance go si downg.
Mind Mi nah back di strap.
And start show chrome.
Wave it in da air and Start buss di roun'.

Now you 'hard what my nigga said.
I won't dance, so just take a chance.
So g' whine pon di willie head.
And grind till the willie dead.
Get vile and skin out.
Till you make Wretch wild.
Like my Nigga Dread.
Yeah cos we're know for harassment.
We're known in the bashment.
If my pockets are empty.
You know where the cash went.
And if we leave and they follow.
Then you know where the gash went.
But the rave was chocca blocca.
There was Willie Bounce, thunderclap.
And a bit of chocca chocca.
Cos the females were getting closer.
I'm living la vida Loca.
Revealing whats in their top.
And they're feeling the toppa toppa.
But I said don't be 'olding man 'an.
And come around with twenty.
Hold poisition.
Freshen Up my life.
And if I told you say i'm different.
Then I'm guessing that I lied.

If you can't Stand Firm.
Inna di dance go 'ome.
Who can't whine.
Inna di dance go si downg.
Mind Mi nah back di strap.
And start show chrome.
Wave it in da air and Start buss di roun'.

If you can't Stand Firm.
Inna di dance go 'ome.
Who can't whine.
Inna di dance go si downg.
Mind Mi nah back di strap.
And start show chrome.
Wave it in da air and Start buss di roun'.

You 'eard what my body said.
We can't move so you've gotta choose.
And groove upon the body head.
And if you make the body dead.
Then you gotta step aside.
And Gotta a better side to run it red.
Couple bottles of red stripe and bunnin' cess.
And we got all the best type of honnies.
Rubbing my cock on her breast.
Like she wanna sex.
Vex if you wanna vex.
Stress if you wanna stress.
Unless you're interested and wanna flex.
Leave all the Skets and the dotty heads.
If you're the best of the best.
Bring it on a bit.
If not I'm gone again.
Next stop another friend.
Guess what I'm offering.
It don't take much to fake love.
And guess what then I'm off again.
She's kind of nice I tried her twice.
Surprise,surprise guess who ain't hollering.

If you can't Stand Firm.
Inna di dance go 'ome.
Who can't whine.
Inna di dance go si downg.
Mind Mi nah back di strap.
And start show chrome.
Wave it in da air and Start buss di roun'.

If you can't Stand Firm.
Inna di dance go 'ome.
Who can't whine.
Inna di dance go si downg.
Mind Mi nah back di strap.
And start show chrome.
Wave it in da air and Start buss di roun'.
