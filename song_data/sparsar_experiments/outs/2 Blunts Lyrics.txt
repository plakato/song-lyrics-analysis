2 Blunts Lyrics
by Xali.

My 2 blunts.
Got me speaking out too much.
Motherfuck the system.
See the truth cut.
Coming at your neck like crew cuts.
Make a move cuz.
Most you niggas stuck up in some new love.
Find a strap and then sleep on a tube blud.
Soak you easy like a used slut.
That don't mean this straight doe.
Tell me why the hell we gotta kill for pesos.
Starved long enough, see the hungy take souls.
Touch the cake, get a face full.
See they a push a pound just to make dough.
Gaining weight off platefuls.
Couple stacks for the most.
See they're grateful of herb like maple.
Come with different type of niggas round the table.
Few criminals.
Few criminals.
Fake duds living fable.
So typical.
So typical.
All schemin' for that money pool.
Don't give a fuck about that lime life.
Never touched the folk.
Never play the fool.
Most niggas don't spend they time right.
Uh.
That's common shit.
Niggas move cool when they're optionless.
Leave your life with a coffin.
See they take a leader life without a caution.
Sitting with the keys at night, like a locksmith.
Make a noise like Rocksmith.
Chopping skis, see the body on your block hit.
Black Caddy rolling topless.
Got your middle fingers up for the cop pit.
Know the law can't stop shit.
Still smoking on the top piff up in the cockpit.
Hit your head when I drop shit.
Know the frame for all you fuck boys.
That's money over everything.
Hoes calling, you avoid.
Let her know it's over.
Let it ring.
Don't waste no time with no chick.
That means spend no time with your baby girl.
Fear the house where hope is.
Steady stuck in the tracks of this hood of this crazy world.
This shit don't phase you.
'long as pussy niggas pay you.
Yeah, niggas talk shit, tell her quick, better say truth.
Watch her clit leave your brain loose.
Pass another drink, *chay?* or bitta cocaine.
Loose your life for the same noose.
Feeder to the main lane living off a drug name.
Police tryn'a slave you.

What you tell a nigga?

Only tryn'a fuck with real niggas.
Power circle, take your money first.
Tell homie better make the kill quicker.
Hands fall for this money, hurt.
Hands fall for this money, hurt.
Hands fall for this money, hurt.
Need a light, tryn'a ease my mind.
No bread talking, this money work.
Hands fall for this money, hurt.
Hands fall for this money, hurt.
Need a light, tryn'a ease my mind.
No bread talking, this money work.

Fuck a nigga gon' do?
Hating on Xi cause the nigga hold truth.
I'mma show the whole block how to speak from the pew.
Common shit in your booth.
I see they put a couple bricks on your youth.
All for drug money, drug money.
Young thugs share blood cause they love ugly.
Come take my gun from me, tug triggers.
See when I'm done, dead bodies.
Hide by the sun in the circle.
With dank in the dub, when I'm next ganja I'm godly.
Murder to the cop beat.
Can't stop me.
Metaphor, Maserati's.
See a pussy nigga try clock me.
Road block me.
See nigga I'm godspeed.
Know niggas that chill where the cops be.
Couple niggas who kill with the Glock piece.
Hold triggers, so real from the Grot Jeep.
Can we stop please?
Let a nigga murder when they drop beats.
That's my job.
Columbine, like my God.
Roll 1 blunt.
Out 2 sacks.
My smack rap.
Your mind gone.

My 2 blunts.
Me and my 2 blunts.
Me and my 2 blunts.
My 2 blunts, my 2 blunts, my 2 blunts.
Yeah nigga.
My 2 blunts.
Me and my 2 blunts.
Me and my 2 blunts.
My 2 blunts, my 2 blunts, my 2 blunts.

Yeah.
