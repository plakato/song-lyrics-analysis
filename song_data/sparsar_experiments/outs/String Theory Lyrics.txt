String Theory Lyrics
by Sydney.

We took care of all the memories left them where they use to be I'm alright.
When there's nothing left but sanity curled up right in front of me I'll do.
fine.
We break it down to modern physics to calculate statistics still we're not.
right.
When there's nothing left to say to me leave it to the memories I'll do fine.

Well it's alright, patiently waiting but somehow, you hesitate, are you ok?

It's in all your awkward faces and random conversations.
You think no one ever sees it but there's always the temptation.
The sight of your fading eyes die, I can't believe it, can't believe it.

We break it down to modern physics to calculate statistics still we're not.
right.
When there's nothing left to say to me leave it to the memories I'll do fine.

Well it's alright patiently waiting but somehow you hesitate.
Are you ok?

Awkward glances, doomed romances, hearts are breaking, pulses racing.

It's all right, you got what you needed, and I'm fine, you better believe it.
x2.

Well it's alright patiently waiting but somehow you hesitate.
Are you ok? x2.
