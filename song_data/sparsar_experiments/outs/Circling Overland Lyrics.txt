Circling Overland Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

1-1-2029, the stars are shining bright, 
 
Nerves connected to the center. We are tied to the machine 
Invisible and silent circling overland 
The, plane makers designed us to out-turn and outmaneuver 
Intruders in our skies intruders in our skies 
 
1-1-2029 tonight the stars are shining bright, 
 
Backbone of the fighter force of the defense industry, 
Devoted tools of The power warrants of the order 
 
1-1-2029 tonight the stars are shining bright, 
, 
Invisible and silent. We are circling overland, 
Circling overland, circling overland, 
, 
Silicon advisors lead the way 
We reach our cruising altitude: 
 
1-1-2029 West Europe midnight 
Invisible and silent. Circling overland 
Scanning taping filing instantly checking 
Every human car and plane of the quarters we survey 
 
1-1-2029 circling overland circling, overland
