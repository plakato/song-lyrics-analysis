Journey Lyrics
by Woodie.

A-Wax 
Yo feel my flury 
Feel, my fury 
Middle finger to the world 
Till, I'm burried 
Heaven or hell 
Choose one or be a treat 
By. Seven, I'm in a spell bumpin' a beat. 
Somethin' comes from deep within me: 
Talkin' sickly, stictly talkin' to me 
So. Possibly I could be goin' insane 
Snortin', this cane 
Stressed out, like a muthafucka flowin', his pain 
Misunderstood by most 
Few people considered close 
It's, a very thin line between foes and folks, 
Slide up and spokes bangin', the curb 
Stumblin' out the driver side tamin'. The Burg 
Mumblin' words ready to reach 
Dawg, I'm deadly wit, heat 
Hold, it steady I'll, be 
A, fuckin', nut patna. What 
Run up and get touched 
Sent him on a journey stretched out on a gurney, 
I'm turnin', more savage as the days go by 
Think. I'M headed for the flames 
Dawg, I ain't. Gon' lie: 
It's a cold world, full a sin: 
What the fuck. What the fuck 
What the fuck are you supposed to do? 
They after you and they want yo soul, 
But it ain't nothin'. You can do 
Wit that chrome, 44 
All, the love in the world couldn't kill this rage 
And. I simply love nothin', but this kill. I blaze. 
 
Let me take you on a journey 
Heaven to the depths of hell, burning 
Westcoast to eastcoast, where we makin' earnings. 
America we ain't scared of ya. We darin' ya, 
Better, be prepared when you hit the Bay Area 
Journey heaven to the depths of hell, burning 
Westcoast to eastcoast, where we makin' earnings 
America. We ain't scared of ya. We darin' ya 
Better, be prepared when you hit the Bay Area, 
, 
Woodie 
That's, the point ya. Existance 
I could feel these haters in a distance 
Plottin' schemin' dreamin' that they can get wit. This 
Witness through the eyes of a survivor 
From these battlefields in the streets. 
I was born a fighter 
And, unlike many others. 
I'Ve been through this shit, 
I've held a homie's hand 
Till. He died and lost grip, 
Homie rip rest in peace 
Things. We used to say but fuck that 
That ain't enough. I'M gon na ride to my grave 
Think. I'M gon na pay for the actions that you make 
I'm way beyond the point of wonder why I'm trait 
This goes to all my enemies, 
Big or small. Your up in the fault, 
I got nothin' to loose, 
I, die or win it all. 
Look. My mind is like a brick wall 
Hard to penetrate 
This stuborn muthafucka, that I am is ready to demonstrate. 
You tend to fake 
Sucka you'll be the first to go 
Cuz, I'm a lay it down right now, 
Woodie, let ya know .
