Darkside Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Did you touch him Teauxny.
No.
I said did you put your hands on my family.
I said fuck no.
You did nothing to stop it though.
If there's blood on my hands there's blood on yours too.
You ain't no better than me.
How you sleep at night old man.
How the fuck do you know I sleep at all.
Switch.
Darkside.
Darkside.
Have you ever been so used to the dark that you're afraid of light yeah.
Yeah tomorrow ain't promised.
Live for the moment.
Up to my vision is swollen.
Calling Lamar to seek the n*ggas that owed him.
Get him that owed him.
The internet showed them.
False writtens and poems.
Shit on your Wi-fi.
Then pissed on your modem.
Sing with an omen.
Lift them and throw them.
Stitch them and sew them.
Shit is golden.
Just send my condolences.
Grimaces growing.
The ink you notice.
Them boys ain't presidents n*ggas is voters.
This is the chosen one mixed with devotion.
Forget your promotion.
That shit you're promoting.
Just sits in this potent ass.
That shit you claim you'll be smoking trash.
Pull up fast on your open casket and throw some trash in.
Throw a jab at your relatives I'm hitting whoever lives.
From reincarnated to being outdated.
Cuz we ain't our latest.
Days trying to see if you're paying attention to just what I mention.
Not to mention I'm mentally four dimensional.
N*ggas start who I mention.
Marksmen precision.
Hieroglyphics lost in the distance.
I'm often assisted by broads and women.
Y'all n*ggas bitches and y'all n*ggas bitching.
Soft as kittens y'all too submissive.
Them same n*ggas say they are starving.
Then say I bought them a kitchen.
Only God can visualize a man's heart beneath the clothes on.
Darkside.
Only God can visualize a man's heart beneath the clothes on.
HBWT life.
Y'all know who it is.
Let's go.
Some people judge me before they greet me before they meet me.
A man of my stature living lavish it sure ain't easy.
I pay them no mind unless they pay me before they please me.
The industry blind to the fact.
The fact is I'm sure they see me.
Praying for better days how I'm living is foul.
Stressing frequently but way more than I have been in a while.
I'm just a sinner struggling still trying to fend for my child.
Still maturing day to day still trying to render my style.
Police brutality they want me to surrender my smile.
Pull the trigger and kill a n*gga what the mission is now.
But Lord knows the n*gga worth more than a ditch in the ground.
Made 200k independently off rhythm and sound.
You know I know the hustle.
Came from the ghetto and know the struggle.
I'm good with money I know the stack and I know the double.
I'm good with bars my arms strong I show the muscle.
Sewing money gets me working my shoulder muscles.
Can't complain cuz how I'm living just ain't the same.
I'm Steph Curry this shit.
Leave it to me to save the game.
Let's get some shit clear.
Before you speak or state the name.
Don't blame me just blame the game.
Only God can visualize a man's heart beneath the clothes.
Only God can visualize a man's heart beneath the clothes.
Only God can visualize a man's heart beneath the clothes.
Only God can visualize a man's heart beneath the clothes.
