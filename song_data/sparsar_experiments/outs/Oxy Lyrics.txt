Oxy Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

Even if I'm left with nothing.
No heart or soul to bare.
Even if I'm left with nothing.
Is anybody there?

Even if I'm left with nothing.
No heart or soul to bare.
Even if I'm left with nothing.
Is anybody there?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

Sometimes I don't even want to try.

Sometimes I wanna leave the world behind.

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?

What have I done?
