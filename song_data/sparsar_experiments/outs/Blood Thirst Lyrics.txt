Blood Thirst Lyrics
by Swing Dee Diablo.

Swing Dee Diablo.

Yeah!, Yo!

I Need Her Blood.
I Can Taste It.
When It Mixes in my Blood Stream.
It Races,I Keep Her In My Basement.
In High School She Carved Slayer In Her Arm.
Bumping Reign In Blood.
Laughing At The Scar.
She Slit Her Wrist.
She Said If I Loved Her.
Then I Would take A Drink.
From Her Fountain Of Youth.
Till Her Blood's extinct.
And of Course I Did.
And Ever Since That Day.
Everything's Been Fine.
Everything's Been A OK.
But Tonight,She's Got Something New In store.
And When We Make Love.
It Always Involves Gore.
She Uses her Panties as A Blind Fold.
Locks The Car Door.
We Ride Off Into The Night.
No Idea What's In Store.
We arrive At Dunz Cemetery.
Her Idea Is Too Make Love On Top Of The Graves.
Where There's People Buried.
She's On Her Period.
I Go Down And Give Her Head.
She Whispers In My Ear.
Let's Make Love To The Dead.
