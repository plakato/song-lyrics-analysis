Moments Lyrics
by Vizual.


Man 
It is one of those nights when you just think about 
Like. What'S next 
What, should I do 
Well, let's go summarize it a little bit more. Shall we 
 
Up High Too low 
Trying to find hope 
Trying to get on my zone. 
Don'T know what will unfold 
Walking through this desert 
Feeling. So under the weather 
Yea, I love the rain, but I hate it when 
I'm feeling so under the pressure so 
Why, I feel so hopeless. 
Don'T know where I'll be going. 
Not scared of the dark, but don't got the courage to step forward my role, since
 
What, I have seems garbage 
Don't got that best equipment 
Got that rock-band mic recordin' 
These thoughts got me. Killin' 
Arrogance won my price 
Got paid by the blood. That'S givin' 
I'm, not good cause of my deeds. 
Sacrifice took now it's risen, 
Spittin' image of my own Father 
I'm, given by the cross 
Cross out my own checks, 
New life re-resolve 
I'm waiting for the moment. I may not even a hold it 
All. The things that I desire is all for Him yea. I know it. 
Everyday isn't promised, but I receive that provision. 
Let me gasp that hope. I surrender what you've given
