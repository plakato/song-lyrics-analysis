From the Crow's Nest on Fire Street Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

Never broken a bone trying to hold on to something so hard.
Step into another yard, and see where the spiders went.
The best part about being a monster.
Is not caring what happens to yourself.
Having teeth that can break without breaking.
No one wants to be your friend.
Watch other people worry their little heads.
They can't breathe sometimes.
But we breathe all the time.
We breathe in deep.

When you get to the top of the tree.
And see there are only branches.
Is that a hill, or are you falling over?
No one can tell.

We were at home.
We exist but we're gone.
Let's travel.
Let's travel and sing together.

Remember things could be much worse.
As you slip into some kind of prayer.
To walk away from those stone walls.
And screen doors that won't close on us yet.

How does one respond to silence?
Keep looking at each other for answers.
What do you think about burning?
What do you burn when you're drinking?
Is it the same as everyone else?
We haven't seen a sunrise that made sense to us yet.
And I doubt we ever will.
