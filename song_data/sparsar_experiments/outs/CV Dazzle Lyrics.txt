CV Dazzle Lyrics
by The Zolas.


Eyes on every corner, every dollar bill.
Paint our faces into Picassos for the kill.

CV dazzle is a way of life.
In this fucked, fuzzy world.
I'm the black and white.
CV dazzle for the love and hate.
With your ten-thousand eyes, watch me pixelate.

Zeroes and ones, won't you tell me which am I?
Sending all our dreams to a spreadsheet in the sky.
