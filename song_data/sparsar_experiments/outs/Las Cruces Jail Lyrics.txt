Las Cruces Jail Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Well, I spent last night in Las Cruces jail.
Rain and hail, born to fail.
Nobody come for to go my bail.
Sun, don't you rise no more.

I shot one man on the county line.
Took his dime and I blew his mind.
Now I'm just sitting here, doing time.
Sun, don't you rise no more.

Well, a restless wind is whistling.
Through my window, through my head.
Through all the straits that I've survived.
And in my hour of darkness.
I keep counsel with the dead.
Just enough to remind me I'm alive.

I write to the governor to hear my plea.
But he don't even answer me.
The judge said he's gonna set my spirit free.
Sun, don't you rise no more.

Gallows high, he chose the day.
Friday the thirteenth of May.
But I don't plan to go that way.
Sun, don't you ruse no more.

Goodnight, my Andalucia.
Don't buy all the lies that they feed you.
And though you're headed slowly.
To some place I can't respect.
I'll keep you in my collection of regret.

And that's twenty-one fell by my gun.
Well they all fell the same.
Just need one more to match my age.
Then I'll count my killing done.
But I won't deny my name:.
Quickest wrist of the chaparral and sage.

Well desperate times call for desperate men.
I'm just a kid but I'll pretend.
My time will come, but until then.
Sun, don't you rise no more.

But I see the gallows alter.
That circle 'round the sun.
They gonna hang me if I stay here.
Shoot me if I run.

That jailer better watch his pride.
Or off my wrists these shackles slide.
Hear my restless forty-five.
Sun don't you rise no more.

Goodnight, my Andalucia.
Don't buy all the lies that they feed you.
And though you're headed slowly.
To some place I can't respect.
I'll keep you in my collection of regrets.

Down the highway, down the road.
To infamy I'll ride.
I'll take my pardon on the run.
With a trail of death behind me.
And Deluvina at my side.
Two silhouettes against the sun.

Well, I spent last night in Las Cruces jail.
Rain and hail, born to fail.
Nobody come for to go my bail.
Sun, don't you rise no more.
