Don't Step On My Shoes Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.

So much smoke I can't see but i keep smoking.
I got hoes in Cali I ain't even know it.
Or did I.
She let me beat when I slid by.
A 305 nigga peep the faith with my tenth eye.
So fall back baseball bats hitting ball caps.
Texting all my bitches where you at.
And it all caps.
Slipping on this lean smoking load so i look jap.
I'll take yo girl she give me dome.
Till her lips chapped.
Back at the crib got her head on my six-pack.
But I'm still smoking blunts.
Young nigga don't give a fuck.
Chilling with a model and her friend bout to pour me up.
Flow so sick I'm throwing up.
These niggas ain't cold enough.
Too hot and I'm warming up.
I heard yo bitch just tatted my name.
I step in the game.
I bang and I bang.
My dread gon hang you know the name.
Spitting fire like I swallowed gasoline.
Like I'm Jeepers Creepers nigga Imma pop up in yo dreams.
Imma run up in yo house with a mask on like scream.
Cause you think I'm alone but I really with my team.
And we all about cash.
We all about ranks.
We came in this bitch and we was dressed in that black.
We really bout that k.
We don't take no break.
That .275 and we all in yo face.

If you trynna bout me for a show.
Boy that's twenty-four k.
I don't settled down with no bitch.
I'm with a new one everyday.
All my niggas bout gettin rich.
We on that grind everyday.
And that brown paper bag.
The 40 the O to keep me straight.
And the counter sto to cop a ditch.
And I don't fuck with grape.
Imma hit the bong and elevate get my mind straight.
Boy I'm in the net.
I'm the rap game's Bill Gates.
So be cool and don't step on my shoes.
Don't step on my shoes x5.
So be cool and don't step on my shoes.
Don't on my shoes x5.
