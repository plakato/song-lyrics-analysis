Things Couldn't Be Better Than What? Lyrics
by Sydney.

Now theres ten thousand singers all singing along.
To sad songs about lovers who tried to move on.
And if dreams are worth dying for then I'll dream till I'm gone.
About kids in a mosh pit all singing my song.

We won't let it die let it die.
Things couldn't get better then this.
We won't let it die let it die.
Things couldn't get better then this.
My body is aching my stomach feels sick.
But things couldn't get better then this.

Well we swore that we'd make it and never give in.
Now I'm back in the van and we're all wearing thin.
If dreams are worth dying for I'll dream till I'm gone.
With my friends all around me and singing along.

We won't let it die let it die.
Things couldn't get better then this.
We won't let it die let it die.
Things couldn't get better then this.
My body is aching my stomach feels sick.
But things couldn't get better then this.

Just keep breathing, and forget the pain.
Just keep dreaming and you'll find a place.
And a part of your youth that was dead.
We'll come right back to life and you'll know what I meant.
Just keep breathing, and forget the pain.
Just keep dreaming and you'll find a place.

Now theres ten thousand singers all singing along.
To sad songs about lovers who tried to move on.
And if dreams are worth dying for then I'll dream till I'm gone.
About kids in a mosh pit all singing my song.

We won't let it die let it die.
Things couldn't get better then this.
We won't let it die let it die.
Things couldn't get better then this.
My body is aching my stomach feels sick.
But things couldn't get better then this.

We won't let it die let it die.
Things couldn't get better then this.
We won't let it die let it die.
Things couldn't get better then this.
My body is aching my stomach feels sick.
But things couldn't get better then this.

Just keep breathing, and forget the pain.
Just keep dreaming and you'll find a place.
And a part of your youth that was dead.
We'll come right back to life and you'll know what I meant.
Just keep breathing, and forget the pain.
Just keep dreaming and you'll find a place.
