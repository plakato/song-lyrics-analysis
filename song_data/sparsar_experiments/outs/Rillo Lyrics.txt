Rillo Lyrics
by Annie Mell Monroe.


Party cause I'm wild yeah I party like an animal.
They tell me calm down I eat these rappers like a cannibal.
My friends all have a story bout the day we met, puff, puff.
Catch another plane I intellect like sudoku.

But I get more digits than you dialing a number.
My beat's on chill still make you look like a slumber.
Wake the fuck up. and come roll with me.
Cause whether you like me or not I'm going down in history.

Came into the game straight spitter don't race got a head-start.
Even when the killers tried to shoot me with the flame.
Spa-sparked me some Mary Jane, smooth, ignorant of pain.
Fifty-fifty makes a hundred, hustling making profit.

Pardon me and make way, way gentle with my flows.
Harder with the rap though, played on the radio.
Who doesn't want a spot huh?
Now I'm on the cover of a magazine you move slow.

Fame is really nothing when you're getting all this cheese.
And they wonder why I'm smiling while I'm pearling blunts please.
Come into my house see my marble floors, diamonds yes I do adore.
And I don't give a fuck about a hater cause they all just wish they had it.
made.
They all just wish they had it made.
