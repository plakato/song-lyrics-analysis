Morning Child - Radio Edit Lyrics
by 4hero.

Started like seed a twinkle in an eye.
Slowly growing daily growing deeper inside.
Only mother nature knows, knows the reasons why.
We fall in love each morning when you open your new.
Eyes.

Keep smiling just like an angel, tiny finger tips.
Touching mine.
Only mother nature knows, knows the reason why.
We fell in love the first time that we heard you.
Softly cry.

Open your eyes to the morning won't you.
Open your eyes to the morning won't you.
Open your eyes to the morning of new life.

So begins the day.
The morning of new life.
Tender is the way the sun sets the world alight.
Only mother nature knows, knows the reasons why.
We fall in love each morning when you open your new.
Eyes.
Keep smiling just like an angel, tiny finger tips.
Touching mine.
Only mother nature knows, knows the reason why.
We fell in love the morning you were born my morning.
Child.

Open your eyes to the morning won't you.
Open your eyes to the morning won't you.
Open your eyes to the morning of new life.
