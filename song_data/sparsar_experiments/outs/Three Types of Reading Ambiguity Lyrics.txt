Three Types of Reading Ambiguity Lyrics
by The Wrens.


Mineral spring road.
A house for 13 grand but more is probably owed.
Market isn't fair.
To row over row of red houses there.

Children with chalk.
Trace squares around discarded lotto cards on the walk.
Someone's losing bet.
fraid you're not leaving old Reading yet.

years keeping track.
Of every slight, family slap &amp; secret attack.
More like rebel war.
As shell follows round to the second floor.

Oceans rose up.
A warning left in leaves left in Eirinn Go...thumb-worn cup/.
Of Death as stick-up man.
Bearing  ashes to ocean by coffee can.

pain as you stood.
To Conal asking if your turning yellow's for good.
Tests showed what they could.
One thing, another, but neither's good.

An uncle flew up.
In time his own decline would have begun in the gut.
2008: to end in hospitals.
While I stood at Reading with Okkervil.

Shillington's hills.
As Alps we.
ran each week to fill an Rx for pills.
Morphine's drop is steep.
One lit in your hand while you nod asleep.

Reading ran out.
No exit from the sign for Hope to center of Doubt.
“West, out West we'll run”.
can't run out Death, he's already come.

farewell, packed the house.
Thinking how Kim's dog had sensed the cancer roiling right through your.
blouse.
banshee's-coming sign.
the trap's snapping shut and it's really time.

{Kevin's song break: Kevin Whelan}.
{Whelan's lyrics aren't printed, so these are all guesses.}.
You said you wanted me.
Without a sound.
You came around and laid down again.
You wait for none.
You ain't the same {?}.
You laid down the fall and break all the same{?}.
When all the weight.
The rain goes down.
My own{?}.
All the time{?}.
That you could ask{?}.

back to Charles Bissell.}.

2003:  break room we cry.
1969: for winter days of rain right after Christmas, at  5.
To sleep safe in the back.
parents drove &amp; smoked with the windows cracked.

2003 on..:  spring up from the sea.
In dreams when you're real young and like a sister to me*.
the dream  I threw a drink.
And the one where you come as Persephone.
{note from Charles: *thanks, Will}.

In each I beg please mother, please.
A reprise, a restart before my own rising seas.
) raised a bailed man.
A 50-ish kept boy in a touring van.

2013: screening the roughs.
A thousand photos in,  million isn't enough.
Not to capture this.
To slow each frame down and/or fasten it.

Into something lit up.
Looked at late.
Year-to-date.
Still in film I shoot the children grow up.
2003 won't* play brides and grooms.
Because it ends with realtors walking empty rooms.
