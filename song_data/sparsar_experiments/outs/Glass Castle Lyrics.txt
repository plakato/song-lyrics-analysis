Glass Castle Lyrics
by The World Alive.


So you think you can get rid of me?
I'll your place at the head of this dynasty.

I am.
I am the reason you're alive.

You need to look back and see.
How you treated me, how you treated me.
When you bite off the hand that feeds.
You'll live without what you truly need.

Refrain.
Sacrificing everything, but does it even mean anything.
Any moment this could all be gone, without respect it won't be long.

Have you had enough of me?
You act like I'm something you can throw away.

You need to look back and see.
How you treated me, how you treated me.

Refrain.

I am the reason you can't run away.
I am the reason you can't escape.
Give up you're mine.
You're terrible inside.
I am the reason you're alive.
I am the reason you're alive.

You need to look back and see.
How you treated me, how you treated me.

Refrain.
