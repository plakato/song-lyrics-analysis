Halcyon Days Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

When jealousy raps on the door 
Well, what have you come here for 
To whisper, your dreams away, 
 
They, say you've loved too hard 
Enough to enrage the gods. 
And now there's hell to pay 
 
And. With your name upon my lips, 
I sunk down, 
And relived, your farewell kiss 
As, I drowned 
 
So. I went off in search of advice. 
Though. You warned me to think twice: 
I see: death on the sea, my love 
 
I, said I'll return'fore long 
And, we'll live in the light of the dawn. 
I heard faint laughter above 
 
And, with your name upon my lips, 
No one's ever loved, like this 
I sunk down, 
And relived, your farewell kiss 
As. I drowned 
 
Run and see run to the shore 
And at your feet on waves, I'll roll 
Still, asleep drenched to the core 
And. We will love like gods once more
