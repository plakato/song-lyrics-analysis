Brakes Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Goddamit, Imma sucka for bright eyes.
Cherry lips leave me in awe.
What I'd give to brush that hair behind her ear.
Now, I want you so bad.
And that's his gaping flaw, A Break in guard.
Wide enough for me to slip my blade inside.
Into his heart. A blackened hole.
Through jaded cartilage, a gaping smile.

Well the cocaine, and the nose bleeds.
Will be the knife that bled you dry.
All the poison, what you've stolen:.
Will be returned a thousand times:.
Before you even close your eyes.
Our name engraved into your hide.

Slow down.
Boy, I think you need to, Hold on.
Turn it down. Tame it up.

Wet like a new born babe:.
Teach me. How do you keep so shameless?
Baby, you still bleed like me.
I'll teach you how to be afraid.
I swear that it's all mostly painless.
Baby, you're not invincible.

Slow down.
Boy, I think you need to, Hold on.
Turn it down. Tame it up.

Now bottle it up. Bottle it up baby.
And breathe out. If you're still seeing red.
Just bottle it up, bottle it up buddy.
We'll see about that luck you keep in hand.

Sanctuary in my bed. I'm coming for your head.

A bad man with a serpent's tongue n a silver spoon, He's choking on.
I can see you shaking.

Get up. And face me like a man.
Show me these hands that strangle life from kids.
Alcohol and orphan tears.
Dead hearts and stolen years.
In the sweatshops fingers blistered to the bone.
In the brothels, broken. You've broken the hope:.
Of a thousand, a thousand crying eyes.
I'll make a fountain, I'll make a fountain out of you.

Ba-ba-ba-ba-dah.
Now, you know this ain't what you want.

I think you need to slow down.
Boy, I think you need to, Hold on.
Turn it down. Tame it up.

Now bottle it up. Bottle it up baby.
And breathe out. If you're still seeing red.
Just bottle it up, bottle it up buddy.
We'll see about that luck you keep in hand.
