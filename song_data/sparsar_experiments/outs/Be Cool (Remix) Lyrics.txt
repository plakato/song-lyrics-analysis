Be Cool (Remix) Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


I'm looking Wretchro, she's looking Wretchro.
She's tryna front like she's reading the Metro.
I pull a stunt like beautiful, let's go.
And switch it up like I'm needing the next flow.
I know a place we can chill playing R&amp;B.
She's in my face like I'm feeling electro.
I show her face, hold still like it's hard to believe.
She bargains with me like I'll deal with the petrol.
We just be cool.
I said we just be cool.
See I don't know about you, but I know 32.
And we just be cool.
I said we just be cool.
I said we just be cool.
See I don't know about you, but I know 32.
And we just be cool.
And we just, I don't know about.
I don't know about, no.

Yo, Tinie Tempah are you gonna be cool?
I'm like Mr Wizzy Wow, yeah, I'm gonna be cool.

Okay, I'm sicker than flu, sicker than cancer.
See I came up from the underground where the ants are.
Where the trains and the buskers and the tramps are.
Concrete surroundings keep me grounded like an anchor.
Show me where your hands are, show me, show me, show me.
Like a goalie, got me boasting while I'm posing for the cameras.
Glamorous, champers, girl I'm feeling amorous.
Space boy fly shit, sicker than you average.

Wizzy Wow &amp; Scorcher.
Mr Sky-walker, you gonna be cool?
I'm so.

Let's Go.

You told me to be cool.
I replied to leave school.
For a nine to five, it's not fly.
And I am, I like cam, camera, eye flash.
Match up, I call, walk quicker, catch up.
You're all talk-killers, why though? Tightrope.
My chain swings, light so, lie low.
I'm looking Wretchro, she's looking Wretchro.
She ain't looking as fly though, I know.

Wizzy Wow &amp; Bashy.
Yo, Bish-bosh-bash are you gonna be cool?
I'm like check my blog Wiz, I dead half of them fools.

It's like them other guys can be cool, chill I'm colder.
Than the ice in your cola, forgot about violence.
But man still wants war like a vengeful soldier.
Hold up! Be cool like John Travolta.
'Cuz my roll dargs will eat you, no samosa.
I'm cold, so polar, you're warm like mocha.
I'm hot, I'm solar, get girls moist super-soaker.
'bashy.com', all over the globe blud!

I still got my Nike's and I got my van shoes.
And we're Wretchro boys, I don't know about you.

So forget about violence.
I'd rather be cool.
Forget about violence.
I'd rather be cool.
And so forget about violence.
I'd rather be cool.
I'm Spaceboy fly.
I don't know about you.
So forget about violence.
I'd rather be cool.
Forget about violence.
I'd rather be cool.
And so forget about violence.
I'd rather be cool.
It's the remix.
So I had to bring my people!

Wizzy Wow &amp; Sway.
Ay-yo Sway, are you gonna be cool?
Course, it's only 8 bars Wizzie.
Let me come and breeze through.

UK, I'm the king of rap, and I quickly adapt.
And I'll shoot at actors, Guy Richie of rap.
I'm a rock and roller, with a revolver.
Lock, stock and two smokin' barrels, I quickly re-snatched.
The limelight, I made the Africans say they're proud.
They used to say it before, but didn't say it loud.
The Signature LP, I left so many speechless.
They're like, what can I say? I tell em say it's out.

Wizzy Wow &amp; Chip.
Aye Mr. Munk, are you gonna be cool?
I'm like, you don't have to ask.
My feature's the answer.

Forget about violence, I'd rather be me.
'Cuz you chased the money but the money chased me.
And you chased the honies but the honies chased me.
It's not a Catch 22 It's more try and catch me.
And any feature I get, I kill it.
They just spit lyrics, I vomit bullets.
So be cool, don't act like you know me.
Go and talk to my hand and the trophy.

Wizzy Wow &amp; Wretch 32.
Yo Wretchro boy, are you gonna be cool?
I'm like Mr Wizzy Wow, yeah, I'm gonna be cool.

I'm as cool as an ice cube, cooler than Ice Cube.
You can see what I'm saying, iTunes.
I'm the breeze, why you clear me in typhoons.
You're just caught up in the air that I fly through.
So unfortunately.
I'm the only one guessing who's cooler than me.

What I do laying down you'd be calling your dreams.

Ah, and now I want my van shoes.
I'm a Wretchroboy, I don't know about you.
I got my iron on tee and I want my van shoes.
We're the Wretchro boys and I got my hype, too.
I got the King hat that match my black shoes.
And the Spaceboy jacket, but I want my fans, too.
Ah, I know, I know.
Ah, cuh I know, I kna-ow.
Ah, cuh I know, I know.
I got my king hat and yeah I got my van shoes.
And we're Wretchro boys, I don't know about you.
