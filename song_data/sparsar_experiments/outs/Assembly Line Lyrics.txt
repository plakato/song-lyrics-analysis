Assembly Line Lyrics
by Zodiac.

Get your steel, caps on.
Don't be asking questions son.
How much you worth and who you are.
They know...
Don't die and don't be late....
Just don't look deep in the eyes.
Of that poor man standing in line.

I don't got no money.
You win some, you lose some.
I don't got no money.
When your paper get....
You ain't got none!
Wasting time, day by day on assembly line.
Wasting time, day by day on assembly line.
So you wanna be free today.
Break those chains and get away.
A good man sweep the floor.
In this.. there ain't no door!
Don't be calling them memories.
Black expression is all you got.
Blind peice paper like I shine!

I don't got no money.
You win some, you lose some.
I don't got no money.
When your paper....
You ain't got none!
Wasting time, day by day on assembly line.
Wasting time, day by day on assembly line.
Wasting time with money on mind.
Wasting time with money on my mind, yeah.
Wasting time day by day on assembly line.
Wasting time day by day on assembly line.
