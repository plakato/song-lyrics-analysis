Heaven On Earth Lyrics
by Boston.


Once I thought that life was easy.
I thought love would be enough.
Now I can't believe I'm on my own.
I'm leaving on a jet plane.
I'll wait in case you change you mind.
You're all I can see when I'm all alone, ooh.

Heaven on Earth.
I didn't know what to say.
For what it's worth.
I never wanted to see you walk away.

The sky is dark and angry.
But I don't feel the rain.
It's all the same, I miss your touch ... ooh.
I feel like running somewhere.
But I can't lose the pain I feel.
I'm so far away, but I'm still in love, oh.

Heaven on Earth.
I didn't know what to say.
For what it's worth.
I never wanted to see you walk away.

Are you looking for love?
Are you looking for love?
Are you even there?
I would come running from anywhere.
Please say you won't give up.

They tell me I'm no angel.
But I've been waitin' long enough.
We made it so far, I can't give up, ooh.

Heaven on Earth.
I didn't know what to say.
For what it's worth.
I never wanted to see you walk away.

Hey, love should be enough.
Oh, heaven on earth.
Seems so easy.
Heaven on earth, ooh.
