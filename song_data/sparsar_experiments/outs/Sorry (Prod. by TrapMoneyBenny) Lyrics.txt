Sorry (Prod. by TrapMoneyBenny) Lyrics
by Yung Gleesh.

Gleesh, Shit bag Shawty...

Trap money long.
But your trap money skinny.
This another track from.
TrapMoneyBenny.
Fifty thousand dollars.
I put half up at Lenox.
I'm sorry x4.

Trap money long.
But your trap money skinny.
This another track from.
TrapMoneyBenny.
Fifty pounds of Bubba Kush.
It's carried in a Bentley.
I'm sorry x4.

Known shawty pop.
Pop pills, pop pistols.
Gleechie got deals on a scale.
No digital.
I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings.
Ten pounds of Bubba Kush.
Got the Gleechie Ja dizzy.
Thirty racks every minute.
Five gallon goop.
Got the Gleechie Ja busy.
Ten thousand dollars.
To a church charity.
Just to keep my spirits uplifted.

Trap money long.
But your trap money skinny.
This another track from.
TrapMoneyBenny.
Fifty thousand dollars.
I put half up at Lenox.
I'm sorry x4.

Trap money long.
But your trap money skinny.
This another track from.
TrapMoneyBenny.
Fifty pounds of Bubba Kush.
It's carried in a Bentley.
I'm sorry x4.

I'm sorry that I sold goop.
Sorry that I sold boof.
Work wit the work.
Man, I'm sorry that I worked you.
I'm sorry that I'm old school.
Pull up on some new school.
Sorry I don't know you.

That candy rain kush.
Healing good boo.
Four or five thousand.
Worth of drugs up in your hood fool.
The stench of boof batch.
Got the K-9's going coocoo!

Trap money long.
But your trap money skinny.
This another track from.
TrapMoneyBenny.
Fifty thousand dollars.
I put half up at Lenox.
I'm sorry x4.
Trap money long.
But your trap money skinny.
This another track from.
TrapMoneyBenny.
Fifty pounds of Bubba Kush.
It's carried in a Bentley.
I'm sorry x4.
