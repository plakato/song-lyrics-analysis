The Clock Lyrics
by 6th Sense.


Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
Yeah Yeah Uh 
Time's, a wastin' 
I tried to design the patience 
Instead. I could define the places 
Way up on another level. 
I coulda tried the basics. 
I never could refine the faceless about face 
I vanish without a trace, 
I'm roamin' without a place, 
To lay my head and call my own 
So I'mma call the phone and get the case blown 
Tick tock. I don't stop the second hand. 
This shit rocks hip hop. I recommend 
And, then again acetamin, but what am I 
Another guy that couldn't go wit', a butterfly 
Another? Why the who? What the, where now 
Prepare now or give em another stare down, 
One time that you get to lose 
When the alarm rings and you set to snooze 
I could be in the whip and forget to cruise 
Give you another tip. You forget the clues 
And. I bet its true that I'm stressin, you 
I'mma, let you through and it's best to do, 
So catch. The view then stretch a few 
A collectible for the professional 
And. The rest is cool, but I figured it out. 
They could use the tool, but I'm diggin it out. 
Of the holder and the time times, runnin' out 
And the time times, runnin' out, 
 
Thom Yorke 
Time is runnin' out for us 
But. You just move the hands upon the clock: 
 
6th Sense, 
So, I'm on the prowl lookin' for somethin to gain 
And, I'm stuffin' the lane thinkin of crushin, the lames 
But. I'M on the clock. Am I crushin, the top 
I got me a quarter. I got me a dime 
And. I got me a time. 
 
Thom Yorke 
You throw coins in a wishing, well 
Wake up 
You just move your hands upon the clock: 
 
It's sorta like we de-evolvin, we ain't the species 
With no time, but I paint the theses. 
Front to end even side to side 
I can provide the rhyme and never tried the lime 
That I put on the edge of the glass 
Never lettin it past 
Forgettin. To ask: am I regrettin the past 
It's only one future, only one sun 
Only one shooter. Only one gun, 
Just one target hit one shot. 
We just done started. We ain't gon', stop 
And. I got the fellas. No, we ain't rockafellas 
But. They got to sell us. Cuz, we'll make em money. 
This is my life that I'm livin right. 
You can never take it from me. 
You stress the dough, I'mma stress the soul, 
With each and every breath I hold 
Is the breath. Control 
That is finna. Get you open 
Copin' with the facts. That'Ll get you strokin', 
And tokin' and get the plaques 
From ocean to ocean to get the tracks 
The quotient of potions to get them back. 
And. Never am I comin' down 
It's 6th Sense, CEO and Notherground. 
That was another round. You get another round, 
 
Thom, Yorke 
It comes to you, begging you to stop 
Wake up 
But. You just move your hands upon the clock. 
Throw coins in a wishing well for us 
You make believe that you are still in charge: 
, 
6th, Sense, 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end. 
I said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end. 
I said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end. 
I said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end. 
I said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end, 
I say 
Time and time again, 
I. Try to rewind and design a end, 
I say 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end. 
I said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end. 
I said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end. 
I said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end. 
I said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end 
And. I'Ve said 
Time and time again: 
I try to rewind and design a end
