Contagious Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway.

Yo I conquer the earth writin rhymes til, my palm hurts 

The menace, send this for the spinach, the ghetto bastard 
Full metal, jacket, causin more racquet. That tennis 
My rhyme will get in your mind. Just like an image 
Your ceaser, like teeth. I take em out like a dentist 
Now. Let'S say you battle me on your best day. 
You still couldn't see me thru telescopes and x-ray 
Put you dead in your bread basket. As of lead, bastard 
I, spit acid blowin out mc's like head gaskets, 
I shred nigga move or lose his head backwards, 
Swallowin mc's, as if they were Sudafed tablets. 
Living these Wonder Years like Fred, Savage 
Walkin, the planet wit verbal havoc to spread havoc 
I hit niggas. In their shoulders, 
Get in your mind, like gingko bulova 
Call me, the shrink niggas be looking gay wearin, pink 
G-strings up they little asses 
Dump em out like bud ashes. 
Call me classious clay. I never delay instant replay..
