Ashes Lyrics
by Von Grey.

Deep in the earth.
Pillars to the sky.
Standing watch.
With ancient pride.
The mother's very own children.
Born of the very green earth.
A kingdom of chiefs and of soldiers.
Chopped to a dearth.
Burning slowly to the ground.
Ashes, ashes they all fall down.
The emerald realm has lost its crown.
Crying softly without a sound.
Hands outstretched.
Want and greed.
Reaching for.
What you don't need.
You beg, you steal, you borrow.
Do you have peace of mind?
Take, take, take.
How do you sleep at night?
Divine.
In time.
You'll find.
What you have done.
