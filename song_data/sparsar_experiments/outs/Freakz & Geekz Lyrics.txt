Freakz & Geekz Lyrics
by Yung DSJ.

The impossible is out the way.
Impeccable is how I stay.
Got them clear vocals now.
Call my flow that blue ray.
Whoo ray is wat I say.
Kick y'all out like mma.
Im jus playin wit yall lives.
This the hip hop Doomsday.
Steamin like cappuccinos.
U actin like al Pacino.
Pass the mic no Dan Marino.
Flow hotter than jalape√±os.
Gotta homeboy that's filipino.
Jus chillin wit a kid that's Latino.
N wildish like casinos.
I'm childish like Gambino.
Go harder than counters granite.
A Monster upon my planet.
The realest youngin god dammit.
The Kidd that hataz can't stand it.
Like wheelchairs I don't care.
Came in the game n it wasn't fair.
Took em out like my name was nair.
I'm the one there ain't no pair.
Money like metropolis.
Essential like I'm phosphorus.
I'm popping off the top of this esophagus.
Really ain't no stopping this.
That ideas preposterous.
We are not synonymous.
I am a rapper hungry hippopotamus.
Jus understand I'm starving.
This beat is what I'm carving.
I go so hard on any beat.
The ref would call it charging.
These ladies call me charming.
These rappers call me harming.
Cuz I'm getting no sleep.
Work at 2 0 clock in the mornin.
These other rappers boring.
I truly don't see competition.
Cuz what's competition if I'm the only person winning.
I'm the best that's given.
I'm young but I'm never kiddin.
This ain't rappin it's just yung dsj living.
To the fullest the coolest.
I thought you knew this u truless.
Ayo here's a fun fact I'm the hottest dude to do this.
U clueless like Dora the explorer to a pothead.
Back from my break jus to show y'all that I'm not dead.
