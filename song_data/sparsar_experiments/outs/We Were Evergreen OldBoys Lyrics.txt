We Were Evergreen OldBoys Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

Remember valor's fucking priceless when it's tightened.
The both of us were vices til that night:.
We were buried in a blizzard.
And we buried those ten years like nails into the hardwood floor.
Left our knuckles in the drywall and our blood stained on the doors.
And I guess that's how we got here.
We did damage, sunk a friendly to the bottom of the oceans deepest trenches.
And our closed lips, they sunk that friendship.

So sorry this came to fists.
But were still going under.
I won't make amends with this.

I have a right hand that is law to the pen or to the jaw.
But it never cared to talk; no it never really gave a fuck.
And our closed fists, they sunk that friendship.

So sorry this came to fists.
But were still going under.
I won't make amends with this.
Were still going under.
Cause I need to tell you something:.

Our warship hearts are battle tested, but at least now they know better, I.

It's sad someone had to lose, but I'm just happy it was you from here on I'm.
just gonna do.
What I do best, fuck everyone else.

So sorry this came to fists.
But were still going under.
I won't make amends with this.
Were still going under.
Cause I need to tell you something:.
I got a piece of you got a piece of me.
