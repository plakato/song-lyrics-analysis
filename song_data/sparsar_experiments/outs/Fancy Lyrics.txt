Fancy Lyrics
by Wordplay.


First things: first, I'm the bestest 
And. If you don't think I'm the best rapper, then you senile 
And, while you hating on me I'll, be getting famous in the meantime, 
And tbh, I'm fucked up 
Walk in the club with my middle fingers up 
I, don't care about! You and I don't care about them, 
So. You can save that shit. While I turn the fuck up, 
They like who dat who dat. T-O-N-E 
Even a brain, dead, muhfucka, know me 
Back in the 314, and you know I'm with Chris 
Live. It up live it up. Vibe, like this 
You know, I'm Word Play. I got ta. Do mines like this aye 
 
They like who dat who dat that's: T-O-N-E, 
Who dat, who dat T-O-N-E, 
Who dat, who dat T-O-N-E,
