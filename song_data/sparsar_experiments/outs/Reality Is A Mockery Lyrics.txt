Reality Is A Mockery Lyrics
by Twitchy.

I said realitys a mockery.
Of what we are not â€˜sposed to be.
I openly.
Can say that i am vocally.
Tryna speak a message, if you only you would listen.
Honesty in every word that i have ever written.
The world has got me thinking, what if this is all a dream.
Stuck inside anothers mind, doing what would seem.
To be impossible.
Those whose use self defense end up in the hospital.
We're living on one lane where everything is optional.
You live or you die.
And when were stabbed in the heart we will not be in the sky.
And that can be a truth or lie.
But who am i.
To say, that heaven can be make believe.
All the hate that we receive.
Can, only make us stronger.
Like some bullet proofed armor.
It'll take something sharper.
To be tearing down this harbor.
I'm a boy with a ideas.
If only you could see me i just hope that your sight heals.
Your riding to bad path, you're using the wrong wheels.
I'm sure that my song kills, like druggies like who pop pills, crack heads in.
high heels.

Realit-y, is mockery.
Open your eyes to the suffering.
This ain't really how its supposed be.
So go ahead come with me.

Yeah, Now i'm back at this rap crap.
Tell that my life flips like pancakes and flapjacks.
Simple dude, with a good attitude.
See you slipping in my corner of view.
Need Some help come and grab my hand.
We all have troubles admit and be a man.
I got some too, They don't involve you.
And, the world..dont revolve around you.
Sticking nine knifes up your god damn boo.
Got So shocked - let me reference pikachu, oo.
Excuse you, I'm a man of word.

Of course, Let me find my manners.
Or i could, wave my finger like i think its a banner.
I'm not threatening i do things awkwardly.
Realitys a mockery.
