Cannot Hide Lyrics
by A-ha.

Can you see me, baby.
Standing in the light?
I feel your cat's eyes on me.
Phosphor in the night.

I'll move inside.
Got those eyes.
Something's burning, baby, that's all right.
You and I are here tonight.

Meet me on the other side.

Take me where I cannot hide.

Meet me on the other side.

You don't know me, girl.
I'm faceless in the crowd.
The things I could show you, babe.
Come on, come on to my cloud.

I'm, I'm alive.
And tonight something's falling, babe, you and I.
Or the sky.
I can see it, it's in your eyes.

Meet me on the other side.

Take me where I cannot hide.

You need, baby, open wide.
tonight.
Take me to the other side.
cannot hide.
I speak French today, baby.

Meet me on the other side.

Take me where I cannot hide.

Yeah.
