God Didnâ€™t Make Me Like You Lyrics
by Tyler Glenn.


Hey I have been freaking out.
Cause I can't keep it up and I'm scared.
I wanna tell you but it's just like a cross to bear.
Just like a cross to bear.

I ride the lightning like I'm nineteen.
And I'm barely aware.
It's like a cross to bear.
Just like a cross to bear.

They wanna talk about my sin.
They wanna say I've lost my shit.
I'm losing my religion.
And I just can't get over it, over it.

I keep on hearing evil voices, voices.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They keep on messing with my choices, choices.
I keep on telling them.

Oh, God didn't give me alternatives, no.
When she put me on the earth.
God didn't make me like girls.
God didn't make me like.

You see me freaking out.
I think that I might do something dumb.
I wanna tell you but I'm not the only one.
I'm not the only one.

Go on, give up on me.
I think my father still loves his son.
I tried to kill myself I'm not the only one.
I'm not the only one.

You wanna talk about my sin.
You wanna say I'm losing it, losing it.

I keep on hearing evil voices, voices.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They keep on messing with my choices, choices.
I keep on telling them.

Oh, God didn't give me alternatives, no.
When she put me on the earth.
God didn't make me like girls.
God didn't make me like you.

God didn't make me like you.
God didn't make me like you.

You see me freaking out I think I might do something dumb.
I wanna tell you but I'm not the only one, I'm not the only one.

I keep on hearing evil voices, voices.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They keep on messing with my choices, choices.
I keep on telling them.

Oh, God didn't give me alternatives, no.
When she put me on the earth.
God didn't make me like girls.
God didn't make me like you.
