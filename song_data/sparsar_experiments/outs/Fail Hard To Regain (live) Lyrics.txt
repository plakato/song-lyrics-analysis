Fail Hard To Regain (live) Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Well once I knew a railway girl, her age was 17.
I gave her all I had to give, but the baggage of my dreams.
Stole me from the games we played, scorned me for my mask.
And if she's gone she lingers on, I beg you please don't ask.

'Twas on a dark March evening, south bound I did ride.
My head was out the window when I found her at my side.
Asked where I was goin' to, I told but where I came.
For the jails in which I've done my time I fail hard to regain.

Dark girl, dark girl it kills me so to watch you so afraid.
You know that you've been real to those and realness should be paid.
Her eyes gone wide, alive she cried. Does pleasure ever last?
We live to see, but patiently, I beg you please don't ask.

She took me in despite my sins, fed me tea and such.
And as she fell just like a child, I crumbled 'neath her touch.
I held my breath and appeared to weep but the fragments of my brain.
See each day's but a moment lad, I fail hard to regain.

But as it goes the fiddler throws our values to the street.
Whole world's pain and sayings as gay as impatience in his field.
And captives of this Wall Street trade, we curse our mortal tasks.
Forgive us though we all must go and where to, please don't ask.

And now I am a misspent man who knows not where he's been.
And oh so sapped with sufferin', the worst is yet unseen.
Renounce myself for further wealth, I take each breath in vain.
Still haunted by that railway girl, I fail hard to regain, hey.
