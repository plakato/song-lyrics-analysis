Mural 3.0 Lyrics
by TygaStan212.

Analytical in your swimming pool, 
Im taking measurements prescriptions, renovations, with
animations 
I am christina applegate without the apple in her
gate. 
I am Jay-Z with out the Z. So i just got
Jay 
Applicable to my analytical mind, is ambiguous to assert the
obvious. 
I am iller than all lyrical miracles, emcees and rug. Rats put into one Crack
dealers Baggie 
I make more money than your mother sitting on the corner for 30
minutes 
I am a bigger whore than Nicki at a BBC
porno
