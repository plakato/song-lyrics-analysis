Cheetah Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


If you want to see me keep me terrorize terrorize.
I can see the fire in your devil eyes devil eyes.
I Know you gon i know you gonna come come come come.
If you want to keep me keep me paralyzed paralyzed.
Come and show me heaven i'll be yours tonight.
I Know you gon gonna come come come come.

Oh something grabs me every time she wonders by ohhh oooohhhooo.

I got her on like a cheetah got to run to my heart ohhh oooohhhooo.

If you want to see me keep me terrified terrified.
Come and show me heaven in your brutal eyes brutal eyes.
I Know you gon i know you gonna come come come come.

When you feel love you never want to give it up x2.

Cause i believe in you because i believe in you ohhh oooohhhooo.
Cause i believe in you because i believe in you ohhh oooohhhooo.
