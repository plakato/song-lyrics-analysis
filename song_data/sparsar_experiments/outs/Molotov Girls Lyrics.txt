Molotov Girls Lyrics
by The Zolas.


Gonna do what I want and that's what's up.
Ain't lookin' for a man to hold me up.
Black coat, pink balaclava.
Throw back a double and we'll go out.

We're molotov girls.
And we're alright.
Dance it out until the streets heed the night.
So tired of being told to keep polite.
This is called being alive.

Skip past the snaking lineup on the street.
We feel the lights are on us, we feel the heat.
Three sparks hit the kerosene.
Let them watch the pretty girls.
Throw their bodies into the machine.

We're molotov girls.
And we're alright.
Spark it up until the streets burn all night.
So tired of being told to keep polite.
This is called being alive.
