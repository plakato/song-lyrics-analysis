My Eternal Wrath Lyrics
by 666.

I can't die.
But that is my only wish.
I don't need another dimension.
Or another life.
I screaming for the total death.
Deeply in the dark forest.
I can't find the end.
Because of you damned livings.

You can take my body.
In between torment.
But your god creates my soul.
To immortal.
My wrath will get you.
If my damnation has come.
To its end.
???

I will there forever.
Every shadow.
Every hateful night.
I'll be the evil of your nightmares.
Until my being gets over.

On the funeral of your loved.
