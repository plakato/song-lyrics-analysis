52 Favourite Things Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

Headed to bed on sunday.
Well that's OK.
My birthday's a week away.
Gonna  have a cake,  swim at the beach.
wake up early, &amp;  go to bed late.

golden loyal dog by the  ground well.
fresh cut grass  ocean in the seashell.
burying robins in the backyard.
use potassium iodide to make slugs shrink and die.
blaming my sister, until i'm free, it's my 52 favourite thing.
Next to  being me.

* Please note for this song the numbers next to certain words.

52 favourite things.
