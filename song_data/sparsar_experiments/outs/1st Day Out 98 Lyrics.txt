1st Day Out 98 Lyrics
by Twiztid.

I got another funky rhyme 
Another funky funky rhyme 
I got another funky rhyme 
Another funky rhyme 
Another funky funky rhyme 
Aww shit. Twiztid 
This is our shit. Man. 
They're finna remake the wicked shit. 
Jamie spit it 
Now. They let the gates up. So I bail 
Six shitty months, pick me up from the county jail 
Smart ass mouth, even though I paid my dues, 
Foam toilet, worn blankets and the rubber shoes 
But I ain't naggin 
Here comes my people in the hooptie muffler draggin 
Ain't been in the hoo ride. Long 
And, the 2 liter of Moon Mist, is almost gone. 
Nuts are kinda, anxious to drop a load. 

The bitch said 
Muthafucka pick me up at three 
Can't bitch Cepta, don't ride your street 
We can eat around the corner. At KFC 
You can take a cab and I'll pay. The fee 
When she showed up. Damn 
She was outta luck. 
I forgot my wallet in the glove box of my truck 
With, the tab from the cab and the dinner too 
With a knot in my sock bitch. I thought you knew 
Dressed to impress chewing dentine gum 
And. I was drunk as fuck and smelled like an alley. Bum 
I'm chewing on my food, like a carnivore, 
Dumb bitch staring at me like an eye sore 
Then. I plopped my face in the bowl of soup. 
And slurped up every last bit up through my missing tooth 
The bitch, jumped up faster than a race. 
And told me had to powder her face 
Since she pickin' up the tab. 
You know that I'ma go for mine, 
Garcon, Shabali'54, vintage wine, 
And a steak well done, and an order of shrimp 
Jamie Madrox playin', the pimp 
She's back now, and her hair ain't fixed 
Probably in the bathroom kickin back takin a shit 
But. I ain't saying nothing though. 
I ain't saying nothing: bout: the muthafucking hoe 
What's up bitch 
You, ready to break 
Besides. How long can one fat bitch take 
Quit snacking and pay the shit 
So? We can go to your crib and watch a horror, flick, 
 
With, your daddy 
You're employed 

Your daddy's. Pretty fresh sweetie pie 
I mean him letting me grip his ride. 
Besides he slipped me a fifty 
But, then again, I'm kinda shifty 
Now, I wan na fuck. So we headed to my house 
F**k sitting with your parents on the couch 
Dad. I got a bitch in my room and I smile 
Take, your ass to the bar and don't come back for awhile 
A juggalo's known for smackin hoes 
But. I need to bust nuts, so I switch to the mack mode, 
Now woman. You know I love you 
So. Why don't you just let me fuck you 
Look bitch, I know you's a freak 
So. Let me get a little kiss on my cheek 
And, a fuck to go with that 
Come on nympho, and let me hit that 
Tell ya. What you! Let me, stick it 
And. I got ta left over piece of chicken for ya 
You little sewer, skank, 
You, nasty, little pipe-smoking money, hungry bitch, 
That's, the shit, J, 
 $ 85 bucks an hour and you wan na play 
And. That was that 
A little smooth talking and she was on her back 
You'll, never guess what 
My first day out and I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my Nut 
Well shit bitch it's my first day out 
And. I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut. 
Well shit bitch it's my first day out 
And. I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut. 
Well shit bitch it's my first day out 
And. I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut. 
First day out and I caught my nut 
First day out and I caught my nut - 
Well shit bitch it's my first day out 
And I caught my nuuuuuut
