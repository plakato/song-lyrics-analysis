V.S.O.P. Lyrics
by World's Fair.


Eating tacos in Barbacoa.
Dreamin' Im in Barcelona.
Alone an Chilling with my niggas.
Who are Avid Stoner's, No Ego.
Leggo my Eggo, Evil defeats the People.
Im out to Equal, Beanie Sigel when he Dropped a Sequel.
My Life is barley Legal, Flying like a Eagle.
Over Continents that Treat my fucking Family like the Beatles.
Im like William Regal lethal use the SEF to beat you.
Im the Best to ever Meet you.
Goin at your fucking People they won't Deny.
The Cobra Ka, Dark like October skies.
I bet you won't Defy see It use your Open Eye.

Hear it Use a Open Mind.
Free as a Open Sky to Dive into my Ocean Life.
Call up Mr. Shaheem shit that.
Make you Feel like when Bishop shot Raheem.
An Showed up the Funeral.
Tell Me Life is Beautiful.
Tell Me Death is Beautiful.
Rose Gold unusual the Chrome Glows.
Stoned Flows, King Arthur suitable.

Sipping Henny all Night to get Rite.
Thinkin' bout Heaven but Im Livin'.
Through Hell to get By but On the Real.
I just wanna Puff Lye until Im High.
In a Foreign Country, Countin' lots of Foreign Money.
