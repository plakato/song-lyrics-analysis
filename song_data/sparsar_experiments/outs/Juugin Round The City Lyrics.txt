Juugin Round The City Lyrics
by Yung Ralph.


Me and Ralph see we been juugin round the city.
Still playin' round with that work.
Diamonds dancing all over my shirt.
Spent 100 cash on that work.
Me and Ralph see we been juugin round the city.
Got bad hoes up on me.
Got bands all up on me.
I gotta shout-out to Rich Homie.
Me and Ralph see we Been juugin round the city.
Juugin round the city juug.
Juugin round the city.
That right too!
Me and Ralph see we Been juugin round the city.

My money coming so fast somebody help me count it.
I don't shop for no rims, plus all cars my come mounted.
Got a bankroll in my pocket, heater on my waste.
50k in my motor, a couple mill in my safe.
Im the juug man still makin' juugs.
Kicking shit in my new Lebrons.
In the hood my top back my ice on I can't ?
Sippin on this purple drank, rollin up this head back.
Makin juugs with Lil Rich Homie, countin all this bread man.
Trap doin numbers tell im bout that life.
? my rolex bout that twice.
I told baby we gone shine on these niggas.
Thats why I overtime grind on these niggas.

Rich Homie Quan.
Juugin round the city with yo bitch.
Juugin round the city with my clique.

Juugin got me rich.
Juugin got that house up on that hit.
Juugin the reason im here Howell Mill claim Juug.
Juugin got my mama out the hood.
Juugin got my patna killed he did all he could.
Juugin why im good.
Juugin got me straight for eva'.
Juugin got me a lil cocky I might say whateva'.
Im wit Juug round juugin we on Cleveland Ave.
Got the pullman pullin' he don't give a damn.
Here girl lookin' tryna' find my pants.
Its Rich Homie Baby!
