Dystopia Lyrics
by Antonym.


The homeless guy on my street sees me rap on my way home.
Those raps done scared you away I suggest you stay gone.
Stirrin' up problems with me keep the hate on.

Stay strong you about to die slow.
White killer people want, nose of a rhino.
Make em blush than turn albino.
I told em all I'd gettem one at a time did one and where'd the line go?
I don't know, probably gone with the hope.
And where's the unity? Probably gone with the pope.
The people cope meanwhile move soap.
Cus' tears dont clean your skin in the shower nope.
Thats how it goes. Thats how it goes.
Current Affairs but nothing bout'em flows.
Derrick Rose, Will derrick rise?
Not if the heat is something he can compromise.

Got my middle finger up with a cup causing ruckus.
Hands on my nuts while I'm willin' out in public.
Welcome to Dystopia.
Yeah yeah welcome to Dystopia.
Got my middle finger up with a cup causing ruckus.
Hands on my nuts while I'm willin' out in public.
Welcome to Dystopia.
Mother fucker welcome to Dystopia.

When the pharmaceuticals make your pupils really small.
The only source of motivation other wise he hits the wall.
Writers brick wall block on the block.
And only puts his words out to get word out his raps shock.
My raps shock you need shocks on your brain.
Suspend your suspension you wear suspenders.
Wait you don't live off your pension, old and slimy hipsters i feel the.
tension.
Between me and you, feeling you, psych i be lying.
Yeah I'm gravity defying, medium I'm barely trying.
Efforts on rappers crying, never stop my tongue from frying.
Other brains than my own one, A rapper mink i own one.
Its actually a mink made of rapper scalps oh he's a cold one.
A bold one, but how can I call myself flattering adjectives like that?
It's subjective fact, Ignore my point of view it tends to crack when I.
