â€‹flood on the floor Lyrics
by Purity Ring.

Don'T forget, forget, don't forget, forget
I, hope, you're, home

Knitting, lace, out of lashes and powdered with ashes
Refrain
I'll, miss keepin' you

I'll. Bury you good and straight and right
Don't forget forget, don't forget, forget
Don't, forget, forget, don't forget forget
I, hope, you're home
Don't forget the way she pushed the water. Inside

I hope. You'Re home
I'll take you out and up and light

I'll take you out and up and light
I hope. You'Re home



She took your face and called it her choir
I'll bury you good and straight and right
I hope, you're home
Misplacin' her sleep to keep the world nearer
Refrain
If. You ask in that soft voice
Screamin' for courage to take oceans. Under

Don'T, forget, forget, don't forget
I hope, you're home
Don't forget, forget, don't forget forget

How you'd fit in the land. If the waves held you under 
She held her hands and told you to wonder
I'll, miss keepin', you
I, hope, you're, sleepin', too
I, hope, you're, home

I, hope, you're, sleepin' too
Don't forget the way she pushed the water. Inside
Don'T, forget, forget, don't forget, forget

I'll, take you out and up and light
She lost her voice down by the river

She. Read your mind and called it a terror
I hope. You'Re home
I'll bury you good and straight and right
Don't forget forget, don't forget forget
Waded through the spirits like a flood on the floor
Wading through the spirits like a flood on the floor.
