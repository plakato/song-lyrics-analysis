Sad Pony Guerilla Girl Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

You say I am loca.
because I am your girl.
You say I am stupid because I am your girl.
You leave me out on the steps you dress me up like a boy.
You say that I am your secret love.
You say to be quiet but I want to tell the whole world.

I like my neighborhood I like my gun.
Drive in my little car I am your girl and I will protect you.
We do it in the back of my little car.
Pull up my pants and fix my bra go on home to your kids.
I'm going to be quiet and I'm going to tell the whole block.
