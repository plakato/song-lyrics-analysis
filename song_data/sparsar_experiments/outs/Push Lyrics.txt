Push Lyrics
by Xavier Simmons.


Crave control.
My pride is cold.
Fight with you.
Then let it go.
I've gotta learn to be wrong.
To surrender.
Clean the mess when the mess is my fault.

Sorry's so hard to say.
The ones I love, I push away.
Push away.

By the time you open up your eyes.
It's too late, they've already gone away.
They're too far.
That's when you start to care.

I crave control.
Make you leave when I need you the most.
I didn't mean to cut you down.
I've gotta learn to be wrong.
To surrender.
Clean the mess when the mess is my fault.

Sorry's so hard to say.
The ones I love, I push away.
Push away.

By the time you open up your eyes.
It's too late, they've already gone away.
They're too far.
That's when you start to care.
