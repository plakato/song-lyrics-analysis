Angeles Lyrics
by Wrathschild.


Gonna be free, one day we gon' fly.
To the other side, golden ride.
Ocean breeze, haze in the sky.
Livin' like a champion, up in the canyon.
Gonna be free, one day we gon' fly.
Smile on the beach if we could only reach it.
Gangster paradise on the bus.
Stars in the pavement, red ropes sayin'.
You will never be one of us.

Angeles, oh Angeles, Angeles, Angeles.
Angeles, oh Angeles, Angeles, Los Angeles.

Ooooo, take my soul, I wanna let you.
Ooooo, wish that I had never met you.

And we're gonna be free, one day we're gonna fly.
To the other side, golden ride.
Ocean breeze, haze in the sky.
Livin' like a champion, up in the canyon.
Night bloomin' Jasmine, waited by a has-been.
Livin' in the street light dead by day.
Houses on stilts in ancient hills.
With eyes that have seen this a million ways.

This place and I, we have an affair.
It's beautiful and violent and full of despair.
