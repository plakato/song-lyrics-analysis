Act Like You Know Lyrics
by 3LW.

Raz B:.
Yea, Raz Beats and 3LW.
Whooo.
Stopped at the Light, Spreewells rolling.
So much on my mind, It's never been spoken.
All I really want to do is kick back.
With my girl, twist a bizzo.
Smoke a sack.
Didn't know while I was walking to my crib.
Catcht ol' girl doing what she did.
I can't believe this how it is.
Get your things and leave your blings.
And hit the door.

Adrienne:.
All the things that I done, for you.
Was all in vain, want none of it true.
The time and money I blew.
When I caught you creeping with my Best friend.
You had me stressing.
I learned my lesson.
A playa gon' be a playa.
It's all in his blood line.

Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know Yea I put my all into it.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know I did it for you.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know How many times are we gonna go through this.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know This I can't take no more.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know I can't let you break my heart.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know Never again Oooh.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know Now You better act like you know.

Kiely:.
Did you know who it was.

I was all you had.
Didn't hurt me, treat me too bad.
But I fell in love, and so I fronted you.
Because I wanted to.
Then you go and do.
The things that make me feel the way that I do now.

Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Now You better act like you know it.

I gave I all of me.
Anything you want , you can get it from me.
I gave it all away.
But not today.
You have the lock and the key.
Now it's all in the past.
Boy you hurt me bad.
One day you will see.
Where my love is at.
You and all of that.
When you were with me.

Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Uh Oh Uh Oh Act like you know.
Now You better act like you know it.
