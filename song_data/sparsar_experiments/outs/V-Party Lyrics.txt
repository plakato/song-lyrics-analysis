V-Party Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


What'S that in my crib 
A party, 
House so big, that's gnarly, 
Whip game party, wrist game party, rich game party, 
Insane party, 
, 
I, pulled up to my party in my new Ferrari 
What's this in my water 
Shit. This must be molly. 
This bitch is hella drunk. She lookin' hella sorry 
Rich chandelier, r-r-retarded, 
Who's knockin' at the door, 
Hugh Hefner 
, 
Party goin' crazy. Who could do it better 
Bitch you ain't invited unless you gettin' cheddar 
This bitch, is hella wet, so bring an umbrella, 
Whole street blocked off traffic. 
This is my party r-ratchet 
Shit. You never seen magic 
 
Don't sit on my couch 
That's Versace fabric 
I in Liberace, bitches snortin', 
This ain't once a month bitch. We do this. All the time. 
I walked into my room, bitches butt-naked 
Party party party. Let'S all get wasted: 
 
Party At my residence 
Everybody. Here we even got the president 
You ain't. At my party bitch, you irrelevant 
Rockstar wasted bitch. We hella bent 
Speakers so loud. We blowin' out the windows 
 this party, they blowin' out the 
 
Runnin' trains on a bitch monkey in the middle 
All, hoes suckin', dick Nintendo 
It's, my party I'll get high. If I want to 
You ain't my bitch, so you know I don't want you 
 off drank ooh. I caught you 
 
Said. You want another shot. 
Well! My bartender ain't got you 
Be mad. If you wan't to 
Bitch I'm a party animal 
Bitches, eatin' bitches out cannibal 
 
Five-o at the party 
That's, not understandable, 
They, was at the door. I let'em in 
I got manners too .
