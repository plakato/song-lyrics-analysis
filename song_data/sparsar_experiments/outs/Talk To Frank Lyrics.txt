Talk To Frank Lyrics
by Virus Syndicate.


He took 2 tabs on tick. 
But came back for a Q ball later 

And. It'S on that he spends all his paper. 
And he'll take bash in a drought. 
I push that one on him as a favour. 
I take that cash and I'm out 
Yeah. I know what the stake's are: 
I shot a box of the grass 
More time laced with sugar and glass 
I sold it for 44, but then I bought it for 4. So you do the math 
I take a penicillin tablet, 
Hit it with a hammer. Then I turn it to bash 
Still. I keep pulling in the man like magnets, 
Shot em out the cheap shit 
Turn it to cash. 
 
I knew I had a chip on my shoulder. 
Never thought it would matter much when I got older, 
Mamma wan na good boy. So that's what I showed her 
Can't tell her bout my life on the street. As a soldier 
But, they told you the rules from the start. 
1 keep business apart from the heart. 
2 be ambitious, but you've got ta play your part 
3. You can either be stupid or smart 
If, your in it then be in it for a purpose. 
The game. Don'T stop! Coz your timid or nervous 
Unemployed to society. Your worthless 
Never had a job, but I've got 2 workers, 
I'm no victim or martyr 
I'm, a hustler baby, 
Like S, dot Carter, 
From the start had my brain in gear 
Now, I'm telling young G's 
Get your training here, 
 
You can say no 
You, don't have To get high, it's cool 
But, I've got flake, blues, MDMA and Peruvian nasal fuel, 
You can say no 
You don't have to get high. It'S cool 
But. I'Ve got flake blues, MDMA and Peruvian nasal fuel. 
I'Ll, sell, em magic, 
I'll, sell em coke 
I'll, sell em. Anything right down from crack to dope 
I'll sell em magic, 
I'll, sell em coke 
I'll, sell em anything right down from crack to dope. 
 
I can get Keys for about 5 G's 
Then shot it in 8th's and 10's 
That's. How I make some friends 
Then? I get rid of it all and do the same again: 
Coz profit, yeah I've got it 
It's the topic of the week 
So. I drop it on the beat 
Like the topic of the week 
It's Friday night and in ready for the mad shit 
One gram, coke. One gram magic 
Time for me to get wasted 
Have a sip of this yo taste it 
Saturday night and I'm on it again: 
More drink, more drugs, more chronic, again 
Time. For me to get wasted 
Have a sip of this yo taste, it 
 
I only ever stepped on the toes of my foes 
Ask, your hoes. What I put in their nose 
You can test mine line for line 
I'm a pretty bright guys, so it gots to shine 
I've had the Midas touch since 12 years, old 
I can turn power into gold. 
Who. Am I to spurn my gift 
Even if them other top shottas are miffed 

There's, no business like dope business, 
Well, no business! I know 
Coz everybody out here, tryina sell something 
What. Are you tryina offload 
There's, no business like dope business, 
Well, no business? I know 
Coz everybody's out here: tryina make paper 
Everybody's tryina get doe
