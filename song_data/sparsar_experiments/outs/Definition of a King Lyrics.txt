Definition of a King Lyrics
by Two Kings in a Cipher.

D.O.P. 
A King a King. What does it mean to me to be a King 
And, bring knowledge to the people as I rap and sing 
Having full control over everything, 
 Yeah? That'S a King, 
 
Amen-Ra 
Your mind your body working in perfect harmony, 
And, learning to control your destiny, 
And free your world, which is full of negativity, 
And live it conciously, 
, 
D.O.P. 
Aiyyo. Why do you think they call me D.O.P. 
Cause? I bring the special delivery. 
That make the deaf hear and blind see: 
 
Amen-Ra 
I'm the star 
The one. They call the noble Amen-Ra 
The message in my music stands: far: 
So it'll reach ya, enlightening 
The peoples of the eyes or the peoples which I be 
, 
I'm, the king, 
 
Yo. What is a cipher three hundred sixty degrees, 
The cycle is square. A circle completion 
D.O.P. is speaking. -- people always ask the relation between 
The cipher and a King and like a noun, it's a person place or thing 
But, let's get a little deeper now can we do it 
For those who already knew it? Let the others get into it. 
First, let's observe a square: four lines are connected. 
All sides are measured, equal
