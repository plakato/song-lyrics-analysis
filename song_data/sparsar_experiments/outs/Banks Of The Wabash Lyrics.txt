Banks Of The Wabash Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away
Written by Paul Dresser
Composed by Paul Dresser
'Round, my Indiana homesteads wave, the cornfields
In, the distance loom, the woodlands, clear and cool
Oftentimes my thoughts revert to scenes of childhood
Where. I first received my lessons nature's school
But one thing there is missing in the picture
Without her face. It seems so incomplete
I long to see my mother in the doorway
As. She stood there years ago, her boy to greet

Oh the moonlight's fair tonight along the Wabash
From, the fields there comes the breath of new mown. Hay
Through, the sycamores, the candle lights are gleaming
On. The banks of the Wabash, far away
Many years, have passed since I strolled by the river
Arm. In arm with sweetheart Mary by my side
It was there, I tried to tell her that I loved her
It was there. I begged of her to be my bride
Long years, have passed since I strolled thro' there churchyard
She's sleeping there. My angel Mary dear
I loved her, but she thought I didn't mean it
Still I'd give my future. Were she only here
