Great Lakes State Lyrics
by The Swellers.

I couldn't make out the signs but I think I'll be myself tonight.
Records break but somehow we make it through.
And all we have is the reoccurring dream that we can hold onto.
It's iced over when you go downtown and you know I'm the heat that you needed.
I'm awake and you're a half a world away.
It's not too late when you're a half a world away.
So don't be scared, I need you.
You know that I would meet you there and see you swim across the great lakes.
I couldn't make out the signs but I can't be by myself tonight.
There's no hope when there's no one else around.
And all we have are these unfamiliar things that we should understand by now.
I'm awake and you're a half a world away.
It's not too late when you're a half a world away.
So don't be scared, I need you.
You know that I would meet you there and see you swim across the great lakes.
Or we'll just let things thaw for now.
And it'll all return to the lake and to the clouds.
Records break but somehow we make it through.
I need something I can hold onto.
I'm awake.
So don't be scared, I need you.
You know that I would meet you there and see you swim across the great lakes.
