Grease (John Travolta) Lyrics
by Yung God.


Ha.
Niggas hate when I do this shit, bruh.
Grease on deck, swag on deck, sushi on deck.
All that, you feel me?
You gotta have white girls on deck to have grease, nigga.
Grease  Oh.
Grease  Oh.
Oh.
Grease.
God.

Stepped in the room, I deserve an applause.
Riding through the hood and I ain't worried about getting robbed.
Yung God never had a 9 to 5 job.
Let's talk grease cause you know I got a lot.
I'm loaded like my Glock. Ch! Bodies drop.
All my hoes know how to suck a cock.
She let me hit and run, like a drunk driver.
Deeper than a scuba diver, ain't no survivors.
AK-47, bitch, it's like a tranquilizer.
Lay him in the dirt, now he's fertilizer.
Wet pussy on deck, we baptize vaginas.
What's 20 thousand?
To a nigga, eating good, just an appetizer.
Damn, I got the grease with the John Travolta moves.
Aqua boy, let's drown him, better pray he water proof.
Hating on the Ocean Gang, bitch, you're shark food.
This ain't nothing new.
I stay with more grease than a black girl 'do.
Nothing over me, I do this shit with ease.
Fuck everybody in the world who disagree.
Wear a jacket in summer cause my chain on freeze.
Came out the water in my Ocean Gang tee.
Fucked her so good, I should charge the girl a fee.
Bunking like the Juice Man, the world under my wings.
Lean like the triple beam, what the fuck you mean?

John Travolta, grease!
I got 3 white bitches coming over.
She begging for the grease and I don't even know her.
I got the  if you come any closer.
John Travolta, grease!
I got 3 white bitches coming over.
She begging for the grease and I don't even know her.
I got the  if you come any closer.

Drip.
Splish, splash.
Dive, swim, dive, splash.
Water!
Grease! Grease! Ohh, oh.
Joven dios.
God.
God.
Yung God!
Yung God! Yung God! Arf!
