Be With You Lyrics
by Virtue.


I want to be with you again.
Drink from the well deep within.
Love everlasting overflows.
I just want to be with, oh, to be with you again.

I can't remember, seems like forever, when was the last time I felt your.
embrace.
But I made the time to steal away, meet me there at our secret place, &amp;.
renew the love I let slip away.

Jesus only you know often times it seems, cares of this world carry me away.
But in one moment, I'm longing for your love, overcomes the world, leads me.
back to you.

Laid before your feet, drink from the blood of your righteousness.
Held in the palm of your hand.
I just want to be there with you.
