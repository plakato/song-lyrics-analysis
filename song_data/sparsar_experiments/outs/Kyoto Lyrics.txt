Kyoto Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Do me I'mma: do me 
I'mma make her mine I'mma, make her mine, 
I fuck the shine. I said, fuck the shine 
Bitch I grind bitch. I grind 
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up 
See me swervin' through they want me locked up, 
Been locked up in my own mind. 
My thoughts will never be shallow. 
 
I got an empire of emotional 
Squad. See me crusin' crusin' in my go: kart 
I'm War ho I'm Warhol 
I'm Wario when I'm in Mario Kart 
Topping the charts 
Ace in my cards 
Choppa my locka. When I'm writing these bars 
Koka Kola Veins, I'm insane 
Trip through memory lane 
Out in Narashino, and I see my own
white shadow 
A tad too close 
Rad with a bad diagnose, 
Coke-filled, nose, 
Too, weird for them other fuccbois 
Catch Lean and sad boys 
Out in Europe. Sippin' cristal 
I'm smoking loud with my lost boys 
All. This money don't make me sad, though 
Rubber bands in my pants bur 
Don't close your eyes. 
And lean back, though 
Ya'll ain't ready for the lean attack, though 
Lean lean lean 
Yunging with my Team 
Pumping RZA eating pizza 
Man, I'm living my dreams, 
 
Do me I'mma. Do me 
I'mma make her mine I'mma, make her mine, 
I fuck the shine. I said fuck the shine 
Bitch I grind bitch. I grind 
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up 
See me swervin' through they want me locked up, 
Been locked up in my own mind. 
My thoughts will never be shallow. 
I'Mma make her mine I'mma, make her mine, 
I fuck the shine. I said, fuck the shine 
Bitch I grind bitch. I grind 
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up 
See me swervin' through they want me locked up, 
Been locked up. In my own mind, 
My thoughts. Will never be shallow 
 
My life, I've comprehended, it's not a lie: 
I'm dependent on my team 
When. I send it. I spit fire, I'm an element, 
I'm everything, 
You're irrelevant 
Take, it easy 
Yeah. We getting it. 
Bbc pants, yeah, I'm getting rich 
All. This love, I'm melting, it 
Don't. Let me down, I'm not meant for it 
If, you ask me, I might come for it. 
I'Ll take back to the rain forest 
My heart and soul. Yeah you tore it. 
I, don't want to be here, but my lives more of it 
There's more of it. 
S-A-D B-O-Y-S 
See me in the club with it tatted on my chest: 
S-A-D B-O-Y-S 
See me in the cut with it tatted on my chest. 
See me on the bus blowing sesh 
Nothing less we, the best 
Fuck the rest 
Water in my lungs 
Finna quest 
I, won't hit the earth 
Fire water, dirt 
Too turnt too burnt 
Make mistakes. I guess I'll, never learn 
See see! That'S my firm 
Nike Nike on my shirt, 
Bubbles bubbles, blowing bubbles 
But. I guess they'll - never burst 
Empire of my state of mind. 
I'Mma. Do me I'mma make it mine, 
I, say fuck, the shine 
I say: fuck the shine 
Bitch I grind bitch. I grind 
I'm hard to find 
 
Do me I'mma. Do me 
I'mma make her mine I'mma, make her mine, 
I fuck the shine. I said, fuck the shine 
Bitch I grind bitch. I grind 
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up 
See me swervin' through they want me locked up, 
Been locked up in my own mind. 
My thoughts will never be shallow. 
I'Mma make her mine I'mma, make her mine, 
I fuck the shine. I said fuck the shine 
Bitch I grind bitch. I grind 
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up 
See me swervin' through they want me locked up, 
Been locked up in my own mind. 
My thoughts will never be shallow. 
I'Mma make her mine I'mma, make her mine, 
I fuck the shine. I said, fuck the shine 
Bitch I grind bitch. I grind 
Yung Lean swerving in see me fucked up 
See me swervin' through they want me locked up, 
Been locked up. In my own mind, 
My thoughts. Will never be shallow
