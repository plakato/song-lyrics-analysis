Gold Lyrics
by S-X.

You are gold.
You are diamond stone.
We've learned to treasure.
You are gold.

You are gold.
You have sylver bones.
You've yearned for pleasure.
You are gold.

You rise and you fall.
Reverberate and then it's all gone.

You climb and you fall.
This is how a human heart sounds.

Into Nirvana.
Carry your ana.
Into Nirvana.
Carry your ana.

You are gold.
You are gold and all.
You've learned to treasure.
You are gold.

You are gold.
You have silver bones.
You've yearned for pleasure.
You are gold.

You rise and you fall.
Reverberate and then it's all gone.

You climb and you fall.
This is how a human heart sounds.

You rise and you fall.
Reverberate and then it's all gone.

You climb and you fall.
This is how a human heart sounds.

Into Nirvana.
Carry your ana.
Into Nirvana.
Carry your ana.

Into Nirvana.

Into Nirvana.

Won't you come with me?

You rise and you fall.
Reverberate and then it's all gone.

You climb and you fall.
This is how a human heart sounds.
