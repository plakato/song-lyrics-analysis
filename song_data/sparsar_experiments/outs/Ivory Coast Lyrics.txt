Ivory Coast Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.

I would rest my heart upon your silver screen
Colored eyes. Black and gold
I would rest my hand upon your window pane
Every time. Black and gold
Always mine, black and gold

I know that you will love me till my eyes. Do close
You're what I love the most
I pray that you will keep me where the starlings pose
Along the Ivory Coast

I could walk for miles with you until you're tired
Along, the shore black and gold
Tell. You you're the only one that I admire
Always mine, black and gold
Every time. Black and gold

I know that you will love me till my eyes. Do close
You're what I love the most
I pray that you will keep me where the starlings pose
Along the Ivory Coast

I know that you will love me till my eyes. Do close
You're what I love the most
I pray that you will keep me where the starlings pose
Along the Ivory Coast
Along, the Ivory Coast
Along, the Ivory Coast
