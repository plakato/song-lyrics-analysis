Stackin' Chips Lyrics
by 3X Krazy.

Keak Da Sneak.
All draped in teal.
Givin' 'em something they can feel.
You can call me the Man Of Steel.
Kryptonite couldn't kill.
Giving all reasons to chill.
Bumping Keep It On The Real.
And you blindfolded.
If you thought wasn't gone make it a mil' bitch.
Been trying to further since the sixth grade.
It's urgent that I get paid.
Flowamatic when my shit laid.
And representing that 3 Kray'.
Mind set on one thang.
That skrilla, scratch, two strikes head of the gate.
And just kick it like a skank.
Some suckers hate.
But not dem playa, man they love me.
And always got something to say ? looking lovely.
Smelly.
Me, Big Ben and Charlie.
Rolling spiffy.
And spinning like the rear end of a nifty.
I strictly, take the ? on me.
Hit the cock, something loud then I pass it to my homie.
Chicks be phony.
Paging me and B at the same time.
Seeing who'll call back first but ? ain't mine.
I gots no time to wine and dine.
Cause once they've been on the phone it's just a waste of time.
Off the rine.
And blunts, them stunts be devastating.
? is out the window which is why the whole car fit.

I'm trying to stack my chips.
Clock a grip.
Make some hits.
Hate to snitch.
Sticks to scripts.
Hits my licks.

? change your Franklins.
They don't take shits in the telly.
? and ready for fetti so bring the steak and spaghetti.
Niggas done let me.
Dig deep in they fucking grab bag.
Can't flip cause deep in they wallets is where my cash at.
I'm on a.
First come, first serve basis.
When I hit the casinos, I'm headed out Reno to Vegas.
Stacking potatoes.
No ? to call the consequence.
Evident I'm about my scratch and I'm about to represent.
Through the crowd.
Freaking it loud with Omega.
Fresh out like Mike but coming back like the Raiders.
Uh, I kill 'em in my gators.
Just pimping and players.
Linens, cannoli's and Rollies, I'm headed straight to the tailors.
Give a fuck I'm in Vegas bitch.
So raise up the dank from Killa Cali.
To Bali, they feed us ? and steaks.
These bitches beg us for plates.
So they touching sidewalks and bullies.
Better prepare for the schooling.
Never worry I'm overruling.
Don't talk till ya do it.
Plus pissy drunk off the fluid.

I can't wait for the mission to kill it.
Just getting skrilla from ? stack millions.
500 drop on the spot on top of the ceiling.
That's on the reala.
A pimp in my.
Fucking rhyme.
Like 'Ball and MJG make sure you call it like you see it.
Just a genius.
I know ya seen us.
In the wind.
So perving is just a matter of time before I do you in.
Off the gin, 500 Benz.
Got me sliding.
So bury the player haters and knock the game out the line.

It's going down in the Bay.
Flossing cold cash around your area.
Thought you heard of a nigga that's stacking mo' chips.
Than the Bank Of America.
Dropping them bombs like a specialist.
Finger eager to kill 'em all up.
Murderous mind, no misdemeanor.
Listen to the bark of my nine go buck.
Sparking off the krazyomatic.
Sparking up my bluntomatic.
Stacking chips up in the attic.
Buck 'em every time with the Flowamatic.
Get ready to get dusted.
Fill up the bag with all your cash or catch a blast.
No bluff we busting.
So run everybody gon' do math by A.G.E.
This sick-o-path.
Wait till your body shoot through running your mouth.
Hit 'em up with the pump then put him in the trunk with the bump.
Crazy, mistreat that ass, I'm ? catching a blast.
Talking like some loud mouth bastard.
Is enough to have that ass subtracted.
They claiming they be jacking.
But I'm a tell you niggas be acting when they rapping.
Got shit full blown that's backwards.
Prolly got a lil' strap but scared to bust a strap.
Come around my way busting strap.
Nigga I'm talking 'bout busting back.
Results of this money and the power.
Making about a G an hour.
Running machines around this bitch and buck to ya cowards.
And I ain't forgot about what you said ho.
Nigga you'll come up missing from that lead smoke.
Cap that ass, 'fore we mack that ass, another dead foe.
Hit him up, get him up, pick him up.
I pop my trunk, no need for that ambulance.
That boy ain't getting up.
Call the coroner to pick him up.
Zip him up, split him up, technical chopping the funk.
Got big enough fucking with ?
? get sick enough.
Gotta get my cash like Mitchell.
Get your cats before they get you.
It's clear as the picture in my 600 Benz.
That I'm out for my dead presidents.
