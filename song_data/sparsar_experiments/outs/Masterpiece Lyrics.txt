Masterpiece Lyrics
by The Wow.

Ko the Legend.
I'm the mutha fuckin' man ALL CAPS.
Uncut dope I be spittin raw raps.
Real big dogs can't hang wit small cats.
I be chillin' with the Forbes listers kickin' hard facts.
Dressed in all black no Batman.
See through every emcee no Cat Scan.
Breakin' bare necks wit my black hands.
Snappin' backs and.
Leavin' bodies in the trash can.
Chasin' 40 acres and some horse power.
But the forecast say we gettin' more showers.
Shit ain't sweet in fact its gettin' more sour.
So I'm chasin' money everyday 24 hours.
This rap shits the easiest.
All  my bars the beefiest.
I bring fire to the world like Prometheus.
Catch me sailin' cross the 7 seas  Odysseus.

Kick raps till the tracks deceased.
I show ya how to make a masterpiece.
I show ya how to make a masterpiece.
I show ya how to make a masterpiece.

I'm beyond a monster I'm passed a beast.
I show ya how to make a masterpiece.
I show ya how to make a masterpiece.
I show ya how to make a masterpiece.

10 years for a homi, $100 a jar.
And I'm chargin' twice the amount on every dollar you borrow.
Whatever happen tonight sun gon come out tomorrow.
Till I cash out some rappers can't even come out the yard.
This that black out.
I'm just tryin to dump a cigar.
And be gone before the police can even jump out the car.
White America you know who we are.
You see the squad.
Give that internet gangster more ammo to feed his blog.
I'm a real man.
Feed my family then feed my dogs.
Nothing left but humble pie and them haters can eat it all.
Play rough when I ball but smoother than raw silk.
Meth shoot it at your head from the booth no John Wilkes.
Now how many has John killed.
Got em screamin' infidel in the house that Sadaam built.
You know the flow when its Meth Man ya boi spit it.
Ya lady like me.
Its more than likely.
Ya boi hit it.
