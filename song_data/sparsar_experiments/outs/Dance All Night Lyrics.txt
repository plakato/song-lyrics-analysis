Dance All Night Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

She ain't lonely now.
See her shuffle across the floor.
Yeah, she's happier now.
See her smile and say come on.

Let's dance all night.
Let's dance all night.
Dance all night.
Yeah, I think she'll be alright.

I ain't lonely now.
Yeah, I got someone I love.
Someone I think about.
Someone for me to take care of.

Dance all night.
Dance all night.
Dance all night.
Yeah, I think I'll be alright.

She ain't lonely now.
See her shuffle across the floor.
Yeah, she's happier now.
See her smile and say come on.

Let's dance all night.
Let's dance all night.
Dance all night.
I think she'll be alright.
