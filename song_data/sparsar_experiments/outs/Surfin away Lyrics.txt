Surfin away Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

Surfin' Away.
I don't know what to say.
He caught my mind.
He was one of a kind.
Did I know him now?

Surfin' Away.
I don't know what to say.
On a cliff I met him there.
I don't know I don't care.

Surfin' Away.
I don't know what to say.
Did I know him now?
Did I know him now?
He caught my eye.
He was one of a kind.
On a cliff I met him there.
I don't know, I don't care.
