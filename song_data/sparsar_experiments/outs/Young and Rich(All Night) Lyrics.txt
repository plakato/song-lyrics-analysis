Young and Rich(All Night) Lyrics
by The 3rd.


Uh!
Heyeayeayeayea.
Shout out my boy King boom.
Shout out my young nigga legend.
Shout out them niggas man, shout out them niggas man.
Ha-ha-ha-ha...ha-ha.
And we say.

How is your life.
How is your life.
How is your life.
Your life feeling sorry.
Your life feeling sorry.
Your life feeling sorry.
We been walking all night.

When I left the house It was daylight.
Me and my homies feeling real tight.
It's just us setting out on a journey.
Middle of the night they'll take us home on a gernie.
Who would've known I'd end up wandering the dark.
And suddenly my ambition my drive was put in park.
I don't know.
Which way to go.
I'm gonna have to hop this wall cause I can't seem to find a door.
Stopping off just for a bite to eat.
Ran into a some nerds havin a meet and greet.
But I can't walk no mo so I decided to take a seat.
Eat our food then we gone on these bastards.
Throw our drinks down just to go faster.
Finding foot imprints in the concrete.
And I swear it was made by my feet.
I know where the end is but it's hella far.
So Let's go back to that junior star.
Feeling like I'm playin frogger runnin cross the street.
Cause one of these cars can lead to my defeat.
Down a steep hill and we arrived at our destination.
Free Jesus pieces hang on trees outside that location.

How is your life.
How is your life.
How is your life.
Your life feeling sorry.
Your life feeling sorry.
Your life feeling sorry.
We been walking all night.

Blaming all our failures on the devil.
Sarcastically because we some rebels.
And now we heading off to new things.
Oh wait pause we could all get some jeans.
On the way to the game we showed up eight minutes late.
Now we sittin on the curb like well shit this is great.
So shout out to kizzee he gon catch the fade.
Right on the concrete boom laid.
Sittin reminiscing on the daylight.

30 minutes later saw the lights of the savior.
And that whole fuckin night was fucked up.
But not a single nights been greater.
GOD!
