All I Do Is Smoke Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


All I Do is Smoke x3.
Cop a dutch and roll a dro.
All I Do is Smoke x3.
Fucking up the room with smoke.
All I Do is Smoke x3.
Coughing off that purple smoke.
All I Do is Smoke x3.
I get high and I stay low.

I'm rollin' up cause all I do is smoke.
I wake up in the morning, grab my lighter then I smoke.
I roll a fucking blunt while getting dressed if you ain't know.
I stuff the fucking blunt now I got weed all on the flo'.
I hit the fucking bong let my mind elevate.
I be getting so damn high till I just procrastinate.
Cause I roll it like a saint, yeah I roll it like a king.
If I'm on my lazy-boy then I pass it to my queen.
She gone roll it up, and we gone smoke it up.
Smell it? Yeah you know its us.
I heard you smoking dust boy don't pass that shit to us.
She wanna split my dutch cause she want get high as fuck.
You ain't on my level, roll a plane, come take a flight with us.
