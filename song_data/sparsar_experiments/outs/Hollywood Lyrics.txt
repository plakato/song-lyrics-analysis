Hollywood Lyrics
by Rufus.

He's on his way.
He's goin' to Hollywood.
He's bussin' it to Hollywood.
Show him the way.
He's movin' to Hollywood.
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood.

He's waited at bus stops all his life.
He's been in and out of those spaces.
Seein' eyes that spoke to him.
From sad and gifted places.
Sad and gifted places.

He's on his way.
He's goin' to Hollywood.
He's bussin' it to Hollywood.
Show him the way.
He's movin' to Hollywood.
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood.

You know he's gonna be dressed to kill.
He's gonna find some brand new thrills.
Whatever he's been looking for.
Tell him that there's so much more.
In Hollywood, Hollywood.

He's on his way.
He's goin' to Hollywood.
He's bussin' it to Hollywood.
Show him the way.
He's movin' to Hollywood.
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood.

Painted faces, sunburnt skin.
Fixed expressions, smiles worn thin.
Caught in the blink of neon of Hollywood.
Bending battles, maneuvering schemes.
False expressions, washed up dreams.
Everybody makes believe.
In Hollywood, Hollywood.

I say, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Uh huh, I say, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Hollywood, uh huh, uh, in Hollywood.
Uh huh, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood yeah yeah.
Uh huh, Hollywood, Hollywood, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Oh oh, that boy say.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yea, yeah.
