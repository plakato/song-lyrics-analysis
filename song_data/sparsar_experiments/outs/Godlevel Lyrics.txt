Godlevel Lyrics
by VNCHY.


Double cups of that dirty Sprite.
If you hearing me you ain't feeling right.
Tell your girl that it's on tonight.
Yeah, we own the night.
I told my pops imma make a mill.
I won't chill till I know how Oprah feel.
And I hope a deal could make love more real.
But being dope and rich is an overkill for these bitches.

We be pulling them switches.

We be ruling em', you confusing em'.
Digits, with these digits from these bitches.

We could never be finished.
Do you remember back in September you said I wouldn't be shit and shit I said.
perfect.
We perfect.
That's perfect ho.
We picture perfect.
We picture perfect ho, we picture perfect see.
Cuz soon you gonna look up to me like I'm crucified.
You can't deny that you stupified.
You prayed to God for the truth, I got in the booth.
You heard now the truth arrived, so now who gon' die for this dream?

Who gon' die for this team?

Who can lie nigga, you can try better you than I.
See this dream has got my team counting to a million ho.
Known to all as original.
If he can blow, we can blow.
Never ever been weak before I could speak in rhymes I could speak in tongues.

Seen some indecent times.
Seen some committing crimes.
They saw me commit to rhymes.
I showed more desire they got inspired.
I was God inspired.
Never been a liar.
When imma make it I'll fuck Shania Twain, all this game, for a nigga 19,.
thought you heard about the team, how you mean, how you mean we be perfect.

We perfect.
We perfect ho.
We perfect.
We picture perfect.
We perfect.
We picture perfect ho, we picture perfect ho.
Tell em all we perfect.
