Pimp Hand Lyrics
by The Purist.

Pimp hard on a ho. Yeah spit bars on a ho. From the Monte to the 
20 bricks in the muhfuckin trunk switch cars on a ho
I be jerkin and thuggin. Under this Cap 9., Everybody in the city know
Its my time. Coupe thang, waiting outside.. You can bet its only Forgies
When. I ride. Splinters in my hand from the wood grain
Making hella money off the books. Mane got ta quarter. Kilo in the kitchen

Laws wan na get a nigga took mane. Got em' knockin on my door with a warrant
Sayin. Can we have a look mane Hell, naw muhfucka, our choppas is poppin
Blow out the wall. Muhfucka. AK-47 point it at ya'll. Muhfuckas
I ain't gon be shy bout it at all my brotha. Bust, the heat shit
Duck, the Precinct. You trust, yo freak bitch. We all gon' fuck her goddamn
You shoulda known that I was on some bullshit when a nigga first came in this
bitch yeah
Send that work up outta town. I need a couple pounds of that: Freddie, Kane in
this bitch
Insane in a bitch. Cocaine on the edge of a razor blade, growing money, trees, I
was late for shade 
I got this shit up out the mud, gettin major paid and now Im getting head on
the skyline
Everybody in the City know its my time: coupe thang, waitin outside
You can bet its only Forgies when I ride

Yeah you know what Im sayin bitch like I was sayin a nigga coming down
Candy paint on some Robin O'Neal shit. Bitches was coming up to me. Like
â€œFred. Let me uh. Let me sick your duck. I mean uh uh suck your dick
You know what Im sayin! Why dont you stick this dick in me like a dog

And. I bet you wan na hold on my name and on this bitch.
