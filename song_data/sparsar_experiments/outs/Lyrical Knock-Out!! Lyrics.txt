Lyrical Knock-Out!! Lyrics
by Swych.


Bet, they won't last one round 
 Three minutes on the clock: uh 
 
How you want it Show me my opponent, 
Show me, my opponent, I'm a show them where the flo' is 
Say. They going all out. I'M a show them where the do' is 
If. You wavy as a ocean I'm coming through, like I'm Moses man. 
The flow is Doc Louis, I'm a show them how to do this. 
I will kill a track, bring it back now. I got it suicidal 
Speak my mind because it hold too much dopeness for a human body. 
These haters couldn't see me if they joined illuminati. 
Dude cannot step to the king. 
You need a x-ray to see the R
