Da Set Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.

= Woman's line, 
 
For, all the fellas on the set who claim they have that funk in they trunk 
Put this in your deck and see if you can make them speakers 
 
So, let's head down the avenue 
And before you leave, drop the top A-come on 
Jay got the ride with the bowling-ball bang 
2500 dollars a rock Aw lookin' good. Now, 
On the set it be Benz's Beamers, 
A whole lotta, guys with loot Check-check-check-check it out 
Cause nothin' better than spendin' cash, 
And catchin' girls in them, dukes True dat, true dat. True dat 
But one thing about the set baby: 
You know it's gon' be hype: Uh Uh 
It be plenty of food and plenty of fun. 
From afternoon, till late at night, Uhh 
 
Jumped in my ride, headed for the set 
You, know the'ave, where all the girls sweat 
Hit the switch turn my CD on 
Toni Braxton
