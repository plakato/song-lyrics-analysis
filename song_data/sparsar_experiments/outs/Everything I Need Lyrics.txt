Everything I Need Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

Where would I be without you What would I.
Do I'll live in fear no longer Now I have you.

I no longer feel like I'm alone His mighty.
Hand leading me to my rightful home 'Cos I.
Believe I'm a part of his masterplan He.
Keeps encouraging me to be a new man.

Everything I need You give it to me.

And when my life is over Where will I go My.
Love for you grows stronger Now that I know.

Say 'S' for the saviour that took a stand.
Say 'O' for the one that can heal this land.
Say 'N' for the new generation that can Yes.
He's the son of God and he's the son of man.

He's loving me, holding me, listening and.
Moulding me Heaven is calling me into his.
Holy hand I've seen the sun that's rising.
To finish this greed 'Cos you are everything.
In my life that I need.
