Pistol Play Lyrics
by Volumes.

Damn I see you with her.
There's nothing more than I would like to put this gun to your face.
I told myself I was finished.
And I'll pull it in a minute.
But first I got something priceless to say.

The memories.
All the shit that you did to me.
Nothing else will follow.
Fuck the sterling, I'll take the gold.
I've been here too many times before.
When you see me in town I suggest you run.
I'm fucking over with you.

Damn I see you with her.
There's nothing more than I would like to put this gun to your face.
I told myself I was finished.
And I'll pull it in a minute.
But first I got something priceless to say.
I hate my fucking friends.

You fade away as I walk my way.
You're just a bitch so rotten.
The thought of you just gets me dazed.
I hope you go forgotten.

You'll fucking go forgotten.
Fucking go forgotten.

I tried for weeks to be so honest.
Finally feel my feet against the floor.
We take the lies from what's upon us.
I cannot listen to you anymore.
Looking for something always searching.
Never got my hands to touch the door.
But now I see the table turning.
Forgetting what your face looked like before.

You fade away as I walk my way.
You're just a bitch so rotten.
The thought of you just gets me dazed.
I hope you go forgotten.

Damn I see you with her.
There's nothing more than I would like to put this gun to your face.
I told myself I was finished.
And I'll pull it in a minute.
But now I've said all that I've had to say.
