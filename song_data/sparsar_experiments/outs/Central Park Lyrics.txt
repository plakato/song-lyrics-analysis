Central Park Lyrics
by Union J.


Staring down an endless avenue.
The sun lasting the night, the end of June.
Even in the crowds I find I'm always looking out for you.

One man band still playing by the lights.
This time around something just don't feel right.
Heart-shaped bulb above my head.
The things I should've said, you never knew.

Oh, I'll make my way back to Central Park.
Trace the pieces of my broken heart.
I'm chasing down a falling star.
To where you are.
I'm held together by your memory.
Baby, won't you just come back to me?
I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart.
Back to Central Park.

You're burned onto my mind like a tattoo.
I'll shoot an arrow straight down Fifth Avenue.
The fortune teller says, Let go of the road but sail across the blue.

I got half that photograph.
The Empire State above the stars.
You've still got yours, let's put them back together.
And let's stay here forever.

I see you standing in a sea of sparks.
We'll find our way back to the start, oh.

I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart.
Back to Central Park.
I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart.
Back to Central Park.
Back to Central Park.
