Jumping In The House Of God Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

Jumping in the house of God.
Jump up, jump in the house.
Jumping in the house of God.
Jumping in the house of God.
Jump up, jump in the house.
Jumping in the house of God.

Lord God, One in three, three in the same.
You promised when we meet in Your name.
You will be with us, You will be here as well.
Lord, to sing You praise, my heart's compelled.
Righteousness and truth are Your throne.
Love and faithfulness Yours to own.
Lord who praise Your name gain blessings.
We're walking in the light of Your presence.

Stick up your hands.
Stick 'em up, get 'em up in the air.
Raise 'em up, up in prayer.
Stick up your hands.
Stick 'em up, get 'em up in the air.
Raise 'em up, up in prayer.
We're getting busy.
We're getting busy.
Who's in the house?
God's in the house!

We rejoice in Your name all day long.
Praise Your love forever strong.
Your Spirit comes, it comes like thunder.
We're gonna sing You songs unnumbered.
Jesus, You died on the cross to free us.
We sing Your praise, Lord Jesus.
Jesus, You died on the cross to free us.
We sing Your praise, Lord Jesus.

From the north to the west to the east to the south.
We're all here, God's in the house.
From the north to the west to the east to the south.
We're all here, God's in the house.
