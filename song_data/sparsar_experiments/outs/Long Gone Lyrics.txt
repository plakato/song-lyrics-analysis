Long Gone Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

She was long gone, long, long gone.
She was gone, gone, the bigger they come.
The larger her hand 'till no one understands.
Why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill.
And I wondered for those I love still.
I cried in my mind where I stand behind.
The beauty of love's in her eyes....

She was long gone, long, long gone.
She was gone, gone, the bigger they come.
The larger her hand 'till no one understands.
Why for so long she'd been gone.

And I borrowed the page.
From a leopard's cage.
And I prowled in the evening sun's glaze.
Her head lifted high to the light in the sky.
The opening dawn on her face....

She was long gone long, long gone.
She was gone, gone, the bigger they come.
The larger her hand 'till no one understands.
Why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill.
And I wondered for those I love still.
I cried in my mind where I stand behind.
The beauty of love's in her eyes....

She was long gone long, long gone.
She was gone, gone, the bigger they come.
The larger her hand 'till no one understands.
Why for so long she'd been gone.

She was long gone long, long gone....
