MONOCOLOR Lyrics
by Twitchy.


A word of state of mind, plenty.
The outsides happy but the insides empty.
Mind turns into a penny.
I grew up too fast so my brains like twenty.
Regret changing too soon.
Just yesterday I remember, toast and a cartoon.
Now this month in June.
I'll be turning 14, im a weird little goon.
Miss my home town.
Everytime I come back, man I swear its going down.
Everytime I come around.
Cause I rule the damn place, from the sky to the ground.
I'm just playin.
Shit comes out my mouth that I never planned on sayin.
Dealing with some troubles that I knew id end up payin.
But the pain is done, happys here, mercys what im slayin, like.

Very little friends.
I say it too much, like the story just begins.
Write a lot of those with some black inked pens.
Turns to success like, deep thought wins.
Not a really social person.
Unless its that cute girl and we get to flirtin'.
Changed for a time so I won't cause her hurtin'.
Changed for a time so her heart is what im searchin'.
But forget about that.
Can we get on with the rap?
Cause im done with the crap.
Too much love on a track.
I just speak whats on my mind.
Threw the mic, I spit a rhyme.
And I think im doing fine.
I'll just hide underground till its my time to shine light.
