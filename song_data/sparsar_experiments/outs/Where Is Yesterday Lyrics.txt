Where Is Yesterday Lyrics
by United States of America.


Do you remember what you said and did.
A thousand years ago?
Where is yesterday?

Do you remember what you said and did.
A thousand weeks ago?
Where is yesterday?

Yesterday in crannies or in nooks you will not find;.
Yesterday in chronicles or books you will not find;.
All you see of yesterday is shadows in your mind;.
Shadows on the pavement but no bodies do you find.

Do you believe that snows of winters long ago return again?
Where is yesterday?
A voice you knew a thousand years ago you can't remember when?
Where is yesterday?

Here is only waiting for a day that went before.
Here is only waiting for an answer at the door;.
Here is only living without knowing why for sure.
Here is something gone you cannot find it anymore.
