Ex Lyrics
by Sworn In.

I don't need you anymore, the lies implanted in my head.
You're a disgrace to the human spirit and every man.
You know that I gave you my life, and all you fucking did was walk on it.

We're through you weren't like this at first, but your life has been cursed.
I hope you don't think ill be there when you're done, you've had your fucking.
fun.
How did I end up here, how did we get this far, your voice rings in my ears, I.
wish I could tear them off.
You're fucking dead, to me. now. you're life is just one big hypocrisy.

How your guilty conscious allows you to sleep at night is a mystery.
If you thought you could treat me like this you're wrong.
I knew there had to be a reason I could write a song, for you I can't trust, a.
fucking word that you say.
If you really want to hurt yourself, come what may.
You don't deserve to walk on this earth.

I pray to god that you won't ever give birth.
Because I can't imagine a creature worse than you.
With an IQ lower, that's hard to outdo.
These times, have taught me the lesson, to never trust somebody like you.

Whats mine was yours, whats yours was mine.
Looks like we left it all behind.
You crave attention in the same way you crave affection.
Its such a shame you can't seem to find both in the same place.
Have you ever stopped to think that maybe you're the one that's fucking crazy.

I swear, on my life, I will destroy your dream.
How did we get this far, how did we get this far, everything I hate, you are.
Blind-sighted by beauty, ill never make the same mistake, again.

I will never.
I want you to know, the way you made me feel. you're a two faced, lying, human.
being.
I hope the person you fuck over next is smarter than the rest.
You are dead, to me.
