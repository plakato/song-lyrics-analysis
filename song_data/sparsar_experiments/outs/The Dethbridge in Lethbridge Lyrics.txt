The Dethbridge in Lethbridge Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

I left your heartbeat in this town.
I left your heartbeat in the ground.
&amp; when there's nothing for us now.
You let me down I let you down.
When your Grandfathers in the ground.

We live in this old aching town.
Our creaking bones won't make a sound.

Let's try to turn our love around.

I left your cold heart in this town.
With family headstones all around.
&amp; when there's nothing for us now.
You let me down I let you down.
With your Grandfather in the ground.
