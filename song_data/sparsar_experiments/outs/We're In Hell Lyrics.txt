We're In Hell Lyrics
by SycAmour.

I apologize for anything I ever did to try to help.
Soup lines to suicides to hell.
I'm never real.
The difference is never clear.
They never feel.
Too insignificant to hear.
I wanna know.
I wanna know your name.

Hey Cinderella, I can tell.
You're waiting on a fairy tale.
Blur out your dreams with cigarettes.
And cheap mascara; make it sell.
Nobody wants to be a rose.

I'm being eaten from the inside.
Some must be destined to die.
At least I tried.
It's getting harder not to blame god.
I used to dream of starlight now I'm.
Staring up through the smoke stacks.
All I see is black.
I'm the sorriest scream on a dead note.
I'm so sorry I, I never met you.
Your superstitions keep a fissure.
Between your brain and.
Your mind; take the time to get it arranged.
Yeah, you'll forget my name.
We'll never be the same.
Another missing, another did in, another day.
Nothing but trouble, just brush it.
Under the rug this way.
There's gotta be a better way.
I've walked through valleys of death.
I've waded in seas of decay.
There's gotta be a better.
State of mind to perpetuate.
Awake, I'm breaking down.
My kids will wake up in the sun.

I'm the sorriest scream on a dead note.
I'm so sorry I, I never meant too.
I wanna know. I wanna know your name.

Hey Cinderella, I can tell you're.
Living in a fairy tale.
Pack up your dreams in cardboard boxes.
Stamp it, lock it, get the hell out.
Nobody wants to be a rose.
