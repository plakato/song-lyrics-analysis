Relief Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

You will drown in mud*.
And I will stand above.
Laughing how ridiculous.
You're lying on the ground.
You're crying to be found.
Do you want me to extend my hand?
Save yourself, I won't regret.
NO REGRETS.
I tried to erase.
So I kicked your face.
I watch you bleeding out.
I WANT TO STAMP YOU OUT NOW.
Should I dry all of your bloody tears?
Trust me, red looks really fine.
Mine is the upper hand.
A fact that you can't stand.
Get nothing but scorn and derision.
Without a sign of pity you call this insanity.
I tell you I could not be farer from this.
Do you want me to extend my hand?
Of course I do.
To pull your heart out of your chest.
Throw it down and walk away relieved.
