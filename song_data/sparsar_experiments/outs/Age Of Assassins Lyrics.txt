Age Of Assassins Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Oh, when the summer sun comes cutting like a clean razor blade.
And I wake to the day and all the visions I've made.
Reach out my hand for the curl of her hair.
And whisper my dreams to the girl who's not there.

Gather some memory from the night before.
Where'd she go? she go? she go?
Screaming her threats and slam of a door.
Well I don't know, don't know, don't know.

So I look to the window and the city below.
From this bed of mine where I eat sweet jelly rolls.
Think I'll put on my face, I'd like to fix me a drink.
Cause somewhere someone knows just what I think.

Last night's but a question that hangs likes a noose.
'Round my throat, my throat.
Surely tonight, I'll invite its abuse.
Well there's no hope, no hope, no hope.

Goodness me, oh my.
Oh my God, I still might get by.
Get through all the pains I fake.
Poor boy could use a break.

A break from all the daily hate, oh.
Pain is something no one else knows.
That's what I hear them say.
But everyone bereaves the day.
So weary, weary, walk away.

So I take to the streets like the dead to the grave.
You light me a smoke because it's right to behave.
And I'm all juiced up all morning, cause morning is when.
Heros stand tall in the statues of men.

And all the pigeons adore me and peck at my feet.
Oh, the fame, the fame, the fame.
Someday they may use my head as a seat.
Well I can't wait, can't wait, can't wait.

Goodness me, oh my.
Oh my God, I still might get by.
Get through all the pains I fake.
Poor boy could use a break.

A break from all the daily hate, oh.
Pain is something no one else knows.
That's what I hear them say.
But everyone bereaves the day.
So weary, weary walk away.

When I die, Lord, bury me deep.
Way out west past Sunset Street.
So I can hear old 29.
When she goes rollin' by.

And when they come to claim my skin.
And I go back where I begin.
Place the stones at my head and feet.
Tell them all I've gone to sleep.

And as the city unravels her metal bedroll.
I dirty her sheets with the stumble I stroll.
And the people all stop just to watch me go by.
With a thirst in my throat and a tear in my eye.

So riddle me this while I lend you my soul.
In a song, a song, a song.
And balance the sky on these shoulders of mine.
Until the dawn, the dawn, the dawn, yeah.

Goodness me, oh my.
Oh my God, I still might get by.
Get through all the pains I fake.
Poor boy could use a break.

A break from my own daily hate, oh.
Pain is something no one else knows.
That's what I hear them say.
But everyone bereaves the day.
So weary, weary, walk away.
