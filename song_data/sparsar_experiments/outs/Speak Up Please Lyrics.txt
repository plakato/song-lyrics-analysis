Speak Up Please Lyrics
by Running Legion.


I've been giving more to you than meets the.
Eye, like a light switch, on is what you're bringing, uh.
Mix some alcohol with confidence and drink it.
I've been saying your thoughts before you even think em.
Last of the world's hip-hop population is incestous.
We all inbreed cause their ain't really much left of us.
I'm lost, been fucked by my family too much.
No child left behind I'm feeling the hemp could bust.
My mind out of itself, I hide behind these bars.
Spit em out, break em down, drive in fancy cars.
To take my loneliness away from me, throw it far.
Like rocks, I hit the pond and break the glass apart.
It's a fascist sport.
It's just rap's from the heart.
And I grab my cart.
Forget the rest of my troubles, I need malt.
Walk away from the dollar store.
Soon as I head home I can hit restart.
