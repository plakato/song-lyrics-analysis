3 in the Head Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

Do or die 
 
Run 
Come on stand up; still-a a nigga, that's gettin, iller 
If, you're, weak and/or, you're, sleepin .
 You get the cap. I peel up. 
And til-I. I kill a sucker duck dope dealer 
Sold to my brother, but the ghetto stands: stiller 
Still-a, standin, commandin and demandin 
From. The get-go got the ghetto, get a medal cause. It'S standin 
I'm makin a buck. They takin a buck. The tax that attacks the world 
A system built to diss em the boys and the girls 
They starvin we're starvin keepin, a nine to five an' 
Try to hold us down, keep us out, but we be risin 
Risin risin risin, like the cream, 
Stiggidy stiggidy, stiggidy, still Stiggidy standin for the team, 
 
We put three in the head 
And the little one said: roll over roll over 
Do or die 
 
D.M.C. 
I run amok upon the sucker duck, punks that I'm steppin on 
The one you're bettin on
