Excerpt Lyrics
by Xian.


X-I-A-N GR8T MUSIC 
Used to have a crush on this chick named Reina. 
Hair was so nice didn't need no peina, 
Played, guitar and sang she was an entertainer 
Probably made her dad proudâ€¦ more. Like Jaina 
Let me explain and paint a vivid image 
Basketball I played for her in every scrimmage 
Thought of her for strength, didn't need. No spinach 
She must have been a snitch cause. I chased her like Quidditch 
Let me tell you how the story went. 
I did a little prank that wasn't taken how I meant 
Took her pics from Myspace and replaced the guys in them with my face 
Had, no idea. This would make me such a disgrace. 
It was a shoddy cut and paste job on every file. 
Couldn'T help but laugh out loud all the while 
When I did. This mischief didn't know how pissed it would make her 
I thought me. A misfit could somehow date her 
Thought she'd think it was funny and cute, like a bunny 
I put them up as pic comments on her profile. 
Probably made her sick vomit and go file, 
An order of restraint, or at least a complaint 
Wasn't trying to be sleazy or creepy. No 
The reasons aren't that various 
Just thought it'd be hilarious, 
Obviously kind of stalkery. You think I
was blind right, 
Well. You know what they say about hindsight: 
It was freaky and weird, I'm honestly saying 
But sorry Reina, I was just playing .
 
This has been on my mind for quite some time. 
I just find it best not to repress regrets. 

This is just a look into my diary book 
 
Mag valuable, but not a high price tag. 
But still cruising through your city with her bright Coach bag 
She's, my homie, so you know I totes brag 
But. It'S kind of bad makes me sad, makes me opposite of glad. 
To feel us drift apart here and there just a tad. 
Brad is still my lad. 
But me and Mag went together like lines, and plaid 
What's going on is something going wrong. 
Am I just played out like that Em' and Rihanna song 
Am, I just out of style like leopard print thongs 
Will. She be there when I defeat Justin Wong 
Will. She be a maid of honor when I marry
Brenda Song 
Man. I hope so. This slope's so slippery 
Feels like a losing battle, so Clippery 
But, unlike them, our plight is different. 
Our friendship lost flight 
Feels like we're missin', our Griffin 
Looks, like our future, but I hope it isn't. 
I know you heard this, but I hope you listened .
 
This has been on my mind for quite some time: 
I just find it best to get stress off my chest. 

This is just a look into my diary. Book
