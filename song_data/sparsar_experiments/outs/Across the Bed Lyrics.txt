Across the Bed Lyrics
by Volumes.

It's the way that you do me, babe.
It's what you do to me.
I move with you so perfectly.
Take it off as I pull you across the bed.
From your head to your feet.
A fever rising vigorously.

It's getting closer.

Reminiscing on the lust you know how it was.
The feeling of the warmth of your breath and your touch.
Laying in bed with that scent of yours.
Staying here instead cause I wanted more.

It's the way that you do me, babe.
It's what you do to me.
I move with you so perfectly.
Take it off as I pull you across the bed.
From your head to your feet.
A fever rising vigorously.

This is the coming of the storm.
Can you feel the form?
In perfect patterns in a perfect dream.
We are starting up a war, starting up a war.
Intoxicated by the lies we breathe.
We are duplicitous and insidious.
You've pushed me further than I've ever dreamed.
We are starting up a war, starting up a war.
It should've ended but we just can't leave so far.

Pick it up and take it down.
Lose your body in the sound.
When you cum it gets me high.
Let me in your world tonight.

It's the way that you do me, babe.
It's what you do to me.
I move with you so perfectly.
Take it off as I pull you across the bed.
From your head to your feet.
A fever rising vigorously.

Reminiscing on the lust you know how it was.
The feeling of the warmth of your breath and your touch.
Laying in bed with that scent of yours.
Staying here instead cause I wanted more.

This is the coming of the storm.
Can you feel the form?
In perfect patterns in a perfect dream.
We are starting up a war, starting up a war.
Intoxicated by the lies we breathe.
We are duplicitous and insidious.
You've pushed me further than I've ever dreamed.
We are starting up a war, starting up a war.
It should've ended but we just can't leave so far.
