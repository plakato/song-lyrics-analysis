Leonardo Lyrics
by Quiet Desperado.

Fuck this bullshit like I'm stickin dick inside some cattle.
Tuckin' my phallus into fat bitches without a saddle.
Bare backin' her back side, free willy til she capsize.
This is my reprise of something I've idealized.
But now it's becomed realized that I've never seen it with my own eyes.

My name's Jack and I'm never letting go.
Of that throat when I'm draggin you off this boat.
Into icy water, drownin the Captain's daughter.
String quartet going down with the ship.
Playin till she skinny dips her slit.

She claims to love whole heartedly.
But I rip her apart and make her a part of me.
This may be offensive.
But if you are oppressive I'll be especially expressive.
Syllables you ingested, are doing what's intended.
Makin your insides bended and bringin em' back mended.

In the way I wanted like I was born the king.
Making burgers with all the beef I can cook up and bring.
To your front door, slappin' a bitch like she's my whore.
Beatin' her face up like 1,2,3,4, I declare her face no more.
C'mon let's settle the score.
I'll be smashing pumpkins because you're the one that I adore.
And if the pain of this neverends I'll be asking nevermore.
Ravens tapping on my chamber door.
