I Bought That Lyrics
by Yung Ralph.


When you see me switchin lanes.
In the bubble gum range.
On them all set wheels.
Man guess what i did.
I bought that bitch.
I just bought that bitch.

I just went ahead and about the pink range sport.
Come and get me boy I'll be in the clear port.
Cuz boy I know you bought them bricks.
I spent all ya money and I bought that bitch.
Cuz if I had a dollar, for ever fuckin hollar.
Get wetter than umbrellas bitch I'm groovier than stellar.
Cuz everytime I come through they do what the bums do.
Lookin all stink luh luh lookin all stink.
I bought a couple of guccis, emilio pucci's.
Always wear kimonos when I buy my sushi.
Mami you a clown turn your smile to a frown.
Cuz it is goin down like town, Julie Brown.

When you see me switchin lanes.
In the bubble gume range.
On them all set wheels.
Man guess what I did.
I bought that bitch.
I just bought that bitch.
