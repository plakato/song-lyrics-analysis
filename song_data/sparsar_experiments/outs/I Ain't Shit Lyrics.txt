I Ain't Shit Lyrics
by SwaVay.

Stay focused 
That's, P-H, 
O-C, 
Yeah, yeah, 
U-Z, 
Yeah, 
E-D, 
Yeah 
That's. For my brother free, my brother, ya'll 
Nah. I Ain't Shit 
Yeah. No, I Ain't Shit. 
Yeah, look 
 
And these days, 
I'm always on pursuit, 
Of happiness; 
My locks, lueked, 
SwaVay, Badu 
And. My daddy is 
In the same state now, 
But still never call 
I stopped taking halls. 
Now voice is going through withdraws, 
This is Nas. After writing. Illmatic 
If, it didn't blow 
Learned it ain't about talent, 
It's, just bout who you know 
Tired of these stupid shows 
Cause. I been giving stupid flows 
I'm tired of every song being bout, some stupid, groupie, hoes 
Like. What'S a flex zone, 
Ain't heard of dat 
Thought, we was saying hip, hop, 
Where the conserves at 
Seen, a white kid online 
With, some jays and a bucket hat 
Say. He trap god 
You ever heard of that 
Not me 
Used, to think no one could stop me 
But they buy into these wack raps 
No, one cop me 
Produce for Hadi 
Boy. I hope he got me 
But now a days 
I just hope. Somebody pop me 
So. I get can get away from earth.
