Your Phone's Off the Hook
by X.

Someone clean to chew on a wife that no one likes.
He called and they said all of New York.
Is a tow-away zone.
He paid sixty dollars on 12th street today.
And now all my money's gone.

You don't have to answer me.
You don't have to call me back.

But you're not.

You hate my older sister and you burglarize her home.
Your dirty invitation waits run over on my street.
I don't care who you don't like.

You don't have to answer me.
You don't have to answer me.
You don't have to call me back.

But you're not.
