Showcase Your Talents Contest Lyrics
by The Yung Fusion.

Red tie in an all black suit.
In a Sin City world - niggas bark like who.
In the dark like move to the spotlight.
Dude so cool I could cruise blue in the hot life.
Spit 2 hard, kill a dead beat twice.
With a scimitar and a bendy knife.
Flow hot on a track tryna melt the ice.
Niggas can't see me so they envy eye.
Mic cheque but I prefer cash.
Clean my flow like birds in a bath.
Fe Fi Fo then fum with a bang.
Feed five foes with scum from a bag.
Cause you are what you eat.
Never harder than me , oh pardon the G.
I be on the roll like drums in a band never parking the beat.
When I spit hella dope-dope bars like these.

Flow hard so I think Micheal Phelped it.
In the same pool so I might infect him.
From my perspective, I'm high as jetsons.
Sitting on this cash like I collect it.
Asian chick with a Harvard brain.
Go harder thane new Armour mane.
Hit them with that mortar rain, in your earphones til a nigga call for pain.
Line 1 caller hey hi how ya doing.
This boy yung fusion got my girls going stupid.
I don't really like him - I think he sucks.
Lils boys like gotta get beat up.
I'm sorry sir, please hold in your wrath.
Not to say that I'm opposing to that but.
You talk myth like rolling a calf.

harder.
Rappers kill beats but nigga I slaughter.
Murder a torture , burn tills it scorch and torn into partials.
Tied to the back of a horse as the horse runs.
Swear that I'm gone since morning.
Fresh till die like I drowned in fa breeze.
Pounding the beat every line is 1 ounce.
And there's 16 for me.
