\ Too Much Thinking \ ( Too Much - Drake Remix ) Lyrics
by X.L..


Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much.
There's no need for us to rush this through.
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much.
This is more than just a new lust for you.

Memories of my past days.

Like my mixtape and my debut.
Im the same me so i'ma stay true.

Is he talking about me  ?
You all know what we been through.
Who the fuck else could it be?
I'ma make it clear so you got to hear this.
Amanda, Angie, Adeline, Amaris.
I'ma make sure that you hear this.
Panda what really happened?
I almost lost a friendship.
Had to step in.
You were crying.
Had to end it.
Something you ain't remembering.
Who was the realest one?
Who loved you before the silicone?
I was the only one.
Now we're awkward friends now.
You're with him now.
So I don't give a fuck.
Angeline do you remember me ?
You would pick me up and then we would fuck.
You can't deny that you loved it.
I can't deny I didn't trust you.
You were waiting on your ex man to call.
And say that he loves you.
So we stayed together cause we're both hurting.
Then we hurt each other, was it really worth it?
Love is sometimes unspoken.
I loved you all i'll just put it all in the open.

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much.
There's no need for us to rush this through.
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much.
This is more than just a new lust for you.

Adeline you're one I got to mention.
You got a new man I won't talk shit I respect him.
So beautiful and in my eyes you were flawless.
Didn't see you were dangerous when it was obvious.
Friends tellin me.
I didn't listen.
This is real love I can't miss it.
So I dismissed them.
Regret it all.
You could've been the one.
Now I fucked up and I lost the one.
I'm embarrassed.
Amaris.
I swear I didn't mean to.
Drunken eyes I was seeing through.
Drunken nights that i'd see you.
Sober thoughts when i'd speak to.
Cried in front of me.
I didn't cry but I care too.
And if you say this isn't true.
You're only lying to yourself.
You don't need nobody else.
But me.
You don't need that nigga your with.
Now you don't talk to me.
You ain't texting me.
Or none of that shit.
It's fucking with me so I had to let it out.
Leaving the past on this song.
Worried where i'm headed now.

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much.
There's no need for us to rush this through.
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much.
This is more than just a new lust for you.

Memories from my past days.
I was looking straight at you.
Drank so much and I was throwing up.
You took care of me you didn't have to.
Hiding it cause your bestfriend.
Was my new girl when I wanted you.
Forbidden love is a bitter drug.
And a crazy high that will fall too soon.
Amy you were the one so tell me what happen?
I know you had to move on so tell me what happen?
You know that I was the one lets make this shit happen.
I been drinking a little too much can I get a reaction?
I'm that same nigga.
I'm that same dude.
I'm the same motherfucker that would come through.
Do you remember me?
Cause I remember you.
Yesenia.
All the shit that we been through.
From the love to the fights to this mess.
From the room to the bed to the sex.
And now you don't answer my text.
What's next?
Remember you told me i'm blessed.
I did it for you.
I did it for us.
I did it for them.
You don't thank me enough.
I did it for us you don't thank me enough.
Now i'm at the top.
And i'm missing my queen.
Fuck it.
I guess it's just me and my team.

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much.
There's no need for us to rush this through.
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much.
This is more than just a new lust for you.
