The Leash Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


Everybody know my story and my glory, used to sleep in the street.
Holes up in my clothes and broken shoes up on my feet.
Never had no time to pay attention to your beef.
But if you feelin' froggy, won't you go ahead and leap.
Live with a demon and I see him every time I go to sleep at night.
Kids tell me they're hungry, what the fuck is they gon' eat tonight?
People lookin' at me like I'm not there.
Nobody ever believed in me.
I'm deceased to everybody, rest in peace tonight.
I'm your nigga, bet you I go wit' ya.
I bet you feelin' like a fucking cyclone hit ya.
I really try to get to fuckin' my chrome lit up.
I mean it I was in it like a styrofoam sipper.
I got demons talkin' to me weighin' heavy on my soul.
Weighin' down my actions like the monkey on my back.
Someone hold my bottle while I fire off the bowl.
Takin' a hit of the green and releasin' my semen, I'm tryna just relax.
But people becomin' so negative, always offend you to laugh and.
To pin you up, they better give it up.
I kept pushin' with the devil in my head.
I sit up on the floor and keep on starin' at the razor-blades.
And thinkin' to myself that it'd be better if I'm dead.
Not knowin' if I'll be around to see another year or two.
Every time I think about my life, I need a beer or two.
Most the time I wish I was invisible.
And I ain't scared of no one just in case you niggas think that I be fearing.
you.
So faded up off of the drink that you would think I'm off of lean.
Niggas use they bitches, sit and wish the phone would ring.
I always used to wish that one day I'd become a king.
Puttin' my life in the hands of no one but myself and I'll be free.
Don't make music for the critics, I make music for the fans.
They're the ones who standin' with me by my side and let me know.
Other people tell me that they're really happy if I made it.
If you really wanna see me fly then won't you help me go up off the leash.

All you have is your fire.
And the place you need to reach.
Don't you ever tame your demons.
But always keep them on a leash.

Back one more time for the niggas thinkin' I was a done deal.
Had to come back for one more spin on that fun wheel.
Hit 'em up with like one more claps.
Time, get up in the mind of your kind, you will find every gun's real.
Nigga this shit's unreal, my son could've been with you.
Ridin' up in the back seat when the hollow tips just missed you.
On fire when the vampire bit you.
Ain't nowhere for you to run, fuck your gun when that demon come get you.
So many nights I spend awake, I don't sleep much.
Faded in the hallway at like three in the morning.
Lookin' at the mirror screamin' at the motherfucka that's lookin' back at me.
Throw the bottle in it, break it, goddammit I'm zonin'.
Wake up, don't remember shit, I do it every time.
All I see is bottles all around, they just surround me on the ground.
A nigga head is poundin' and I feel I'm drownin' and I'm down and out.
Because a nigga fresh up out the County.

Get up off the couch, I need to get my own shit.
Got up out the pen' and made a way all by myself.
And jumped up in the studio and made a song called Dome Split.
I was killin' niggas.
Movin' all around this here country.
I was livin' on the Greyhound with a 40 bottle and some lunch meat.
Dumping on any motherfucker tryna run up and pump me.
Bumpy Johnson nigga, it's not 21 Jump Street.
Dreams of playin' sold out arenas.
Wishin' that my granddaddy seen us.
I am a pure wicked genius.
Brain is lost somewhere on Venus.
No music for the critics, I make music for the fans.
They're the ones who standin' with me by my side and let me know.
Other people tell me that they're really happy that I made it.
If you really wanna see me fly then won't you help me go up off the leash.
