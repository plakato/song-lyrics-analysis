Boys You Won't Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Boys you won't remember.
From the minute.
You walked into the room.
Every letter started broken hearted.
And ended way too soon.

Lived through underrated.
Getting jaded.
To wind up with no one.
Hiding in new places, getting wasted.
Singing I guess we're done.

I don't want you to wonder why.
It won't do any good.
You don't know what you got into.
Until you know when its all gone wrong.

And I don't the feel the need to try and explain.
Excuses sounding the same.
You're gonna find you're gonna find.
I'm feeling down, but I stood up.
Dead up off the ground, but I stood up.
Lost without a sound, but I stood up.
Facing you're not around, but I stood up.
You want me, you want me.

Don't know what you got on me.
I'll even it just you wait and see.
