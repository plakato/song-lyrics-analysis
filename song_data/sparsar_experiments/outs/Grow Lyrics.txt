Grow Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Must been a record.
Must been a fastest time.
Looking for a new sensation.
Wanna be the first to try.

You sick of talk You sick of talk x4.
You sick of talk.

And Now you surround me.
You look just like you mother said you would.
And your joy surrounds me.
Remember the way you use to look.
And Now you surround me.
You look just like you mother said you would.
Your joy surrounds me.
Just like you mother said your mother said you would.

Gotta be electric.
Gotta be first in line.
Looking for a new direction.
Wanna be last in time.

You sick of talk You sick of talk x8.

And Now you surround me.
You look just like you mother said you would.
Your joy surrounds me.
Just like you mother said your mother said you would.

Just like your mother said you would â€˜.
You sick of talk.
You sick of talk talk talk talk talk x2.
Whooooowhooooo x2.
