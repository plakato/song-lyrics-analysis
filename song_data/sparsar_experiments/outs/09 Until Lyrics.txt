09 Until Lyrics
by Tyga.

Dial up seven digits.
Car stripper, trife livin.
Show you what I'm paid but you won't get it.
Already spent it, hundred thou ? 16 ?
Make you feel like the richest No!
What happen when them cloths won't fit ya.
And everybody asking for pictures, onto the next.
One fan say ya sick man others say my shit weak.
I do not sweat them, I am but a risk, band.
Young money mulligan play gulf on ya head.
Swing swing like lesbians and a man.
Don't wanna share his wife but we already did.
Ghetto fly nigga form his ship.
Its like amistad all black when we dip ah.
Car with with rims ah don't matter what we in cuz we already in forever.
The end chivalry I good night this shit.
Goodbye to the flaw say hello to you God.

Such a globe traveler, farchulin while you where at home.
I was busy ordering steaks threw the phone like medium rare, no wait well done.
Don't care if you won.
Tyga I am the one.

This is why I'm ill 09 until.
This is why I'm ill 09 until.
This is why I'm ill 09 until.
Forever y'all.
This is why I'm ill 09 until.

This is why I'm ill 09 until.
This is why I'm ill 09 until.
Forever y'all.

I really kick flow.
I really been broke.
Look at me now doe everynight another show.
What are those doe.
Glow in the dark shoes.
How you get those.
Wish I really knew.
Like mario, my city red and blue.
Born from L.A. eat roscoes.
Lucy tacos knew some vatos.
Tat tata tat ink like kinkos.
I put a dollar in the pot watch the pot grow.
I pop up with the heat like hot toast.
You would recycle if you see what I knew.
So keep your eyes closed and lower your IQ.
I feel like two, they can judge me but there's no gaffle and stool.
Only gospel can save you good music immune.
I'm ill sick my lyrics like pew.
