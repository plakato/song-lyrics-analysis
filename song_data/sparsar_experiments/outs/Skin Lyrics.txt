Skin Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.


Safety net don't hold me now.
In this hole I've fallen down.
Secret home I've made and found.
A new way to breathe.

Skin come off.
Skin come off.
I've had enough, ooh ooh.
Skin come off.

And in the sickness.
You are free.
And in the thickness.
You'll find me.

You'll find me.

In the city, you find faith.
In the people you see fear.
That remind you of your own.
Let it go.

And in the sickness.
You are free.
And in the thickness.
You'll find me.
Finally, finally.
You don't have to beg.
Finally.
