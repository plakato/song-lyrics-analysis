Juniper Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


There's no way, it's ruined now.
Can't take it back, no, don't ask me how.
I'll live my life, I'll leave my doubts.
I'm worn away now if that's what counts.

I won't stay if you ask me to, don't ask me to.
Because I won't.
I won't weep if you want me to, don't want me to.
Because I won't.

Burn all my things because I won't come back.
Burn all my dreams, I don't want them back.

Ah, how I loved you.
Leave through my window.
