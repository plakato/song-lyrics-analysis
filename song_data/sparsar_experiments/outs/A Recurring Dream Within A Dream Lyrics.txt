A Recurring Dream Within A Dream Lyrics
by Alan Parsons.

For my own part, I have never had a thought which I could not set down in.
words, with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it....

...in words....

The clock struck midnight.
And through my sleeping.
I heard a tapping at my door.
I looked, but nothing.
Lay in the darkness.
And so I turned inside once more.

To my amazement.
There stood a Raven.
Whose shadow hung above my door.
The through the silence.
It spoke the one word.
That I shall hear for evermore....

Quoth the Raven, Nevermore.
Thus quoth the Raven, Nevermore.
Nevermore....

...in words....

And still the Raven.
Remains in my room.
No matter how much I implore.
No words can soothe him.
No prayer remove him.
And I must hear for evermore....

Quoth the Raven, Nevermore.
Thus quoth the Raven, Nevermore.
Nevermore....
