These niggas, like bitches, be fake 
From head to toe laced up wit, hate nigga, 
I'm, a playa, 
Ridin cuz fake niggas, be scary, liers, 
Runnin, tired, 
Got me strapped up in a zone to open fire 
You got killas. We got killas to play the game of cash 
Too many softies tryin to copy, but now I'm up in they ass, 
See mama raised me to be a leader, so mutha fucka follow me 
When the funk go down. We ridin' deep 
Wit a. I got you an a you, get me 
Fear, no man, but God. So if it's on its on 
Cowards can come an get ya, but I'mma get ya later. On

Cuz. We on a mission for riches

That give a fuck about ya: feelin's cuz nigga its strictly business 
Nigga. What Back up off me, you softie 
I'm a cold piece of work like a dope fiend when 
You bitch niggas try to cross me. 
 
The, Sickness of a million niggas 
Envy, the enemy 
The remedy leave ya. Mind froze 
An blind fold. An tied up in a truck 
That, says THREE TIMES fa ya, mind ho 
An. They find foes in a Cutlass sweet 
Destruction of East

You, gettin robbed nigga

So, don't be slippin 
Hatin an seregatin, an thought them youngstas wasn't trippin 
Do G's get to go
