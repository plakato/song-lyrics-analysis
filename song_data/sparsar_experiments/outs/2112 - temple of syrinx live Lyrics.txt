2112 - temple of syrinx live Lyrics
by Rush.

And the meek shall inherit the earth....

We've taken care of everything.
The words you hear, the songs you sing.
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes.
It's one for all, all for one.
We work together, common sons.
Never need to wonder how or why.

We are the priests.
Of the temples of syrinx.
Our great computers.
Fill the hollowed halls.
We are the priests.
Of the temples of syrinx.
All the gifts of life.
Are held within our walls.

Look around this world we made.
Equality our stock in trade.
Come and join the brotherhood of man.
Oh what a wide contented world.
Let the banners be unfurled.
Hold the red star proudly high in hand.

We are the priests.
Of the temples of syrinx.
Our great computers.
Fill the hollowed halls.
We are the priests.
Of the temples of syrinx.
All the gifts of life.
Are held within our walls.
