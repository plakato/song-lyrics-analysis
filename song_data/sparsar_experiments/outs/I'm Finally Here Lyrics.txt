I'm Finally Here Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


Little against me: / no felony/, 
No Blackmail/, Get it no black male / My mind off that rail/ 
I'm, so Canadian white, everybody know/ 
I'm, so Canadian white, my cousin is snow/. 
Asher Roth/ perish the thought/ cause, I'm not/ 
Even. My nose can rap better with iller snot/ 
Though, I'm antithesis/ of gangster appearances/, I'm serious/, The illest
lyricist/ in Ontario areas/ 
8th grade teach Mrs. Potonik/, got
it/ 
Living in a mosaic forget politic, / 
Black kid always played the race card/, the white kid face's, 
Beat hard/, The Indian's Voice gave a joke to the retard/ 
But Asian kids were good at math. We aren't/ 
But. All of us wanted to see the stars/ 
I've, never been a hoodlum/ or a Muslim/ 
But. I knew some/ some smart, some dumb/, some good, some scum/ Peace. It'S what
we all want and need done. Son/ 
When, we were little kids, we acted like punks/ 
And. We were trading, Yu-gi-oh spell cards/ 
But. In our field, yard/. We still found grenade shell, shards/ 
Teaching us that life is a war zone/ 
And we get in strife. We don't like or condone/ my pain 
Is, not my own/, but I've grown/ to
write, a Poem/ 
From, the soul as shown/ with knowledge. I'Ve always 

At home/, with my bros/ Ghetto's heaven/ I'll step, in/ 
That's. Why I like Eminem, Pac and tech/ 
When? I listen to them. They talk the real shit/ 
That I respect/. Now I'm trying to inter-connect/ 
Various thoughts in my intellect/ 
The ghetto of diversity/, my stiletto in university/ 
I got ta figure out something that works for me/ 
 
First with the Renaissance men project/ 
I felt like Kate, Middleton, 
royally, screwed/, 
Then, Priestly, Demolition/, I
envisioned/ 
Magnificence, then loyalty Moved/ 
I ain't holding on to bitterness/. I ain't quitting shit/ 
Going hard/ the past on my radar/ is a blinking blip/ 
The holy one know me/ as Hip-hop's Obi-Wan Kenobi/ 
Use the force/ pass. The torch/ I
even go hard on a slow, beat/ 
But time for Sabbath time to be relaxing/. 
Heavy burden is off time to lay back then/ 
To. Give you words/ and proverbs/ from my own mind/ 
To learn is human, but to teach is divine/ 
First/. If you work/ your ass off, you won't take crap/ 
And, you can be hustling without selling crack/ 
In fact/. The words of the track/ should make you feel/. 
Hip-Hop is like Wendy's. You know when it's real/ 
Divinely inspired pray/ three time a day/ 
Like eating meals/. It'S nourishment in a way/ 
So, then I knell/ â€˜Please Lord help me to live this'/ 
Cause. I just can't live life without forgiveness.'/

- Rob Bell's Sermon on Forgiveness can be found, here-

To quote Gandalf. We cannot choose the time we live in/. We can only Choose/
what. We do/ with the time we are given/ 
So I'd rather be poor and righteous than rich and wicked/. 
And say what I mean and mean what I say when I spit it/ 
But Nas said it best for me and my game. Yo/ 
It was clear why the struggle was so painful/ 
Metamorphosis. This is what I changed: to/ 
And God, I'm so thankful/
