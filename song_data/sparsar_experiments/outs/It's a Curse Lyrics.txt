It's a Curse Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Just the other night.
Body twisted and unfound.
You know it's there lying.

They are too dead but the body don't mind.

Oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh.
You know a neutral sky.
And nothing to do at night.
Little highway lights.
They shine.
From the top of the mountain to the rock and sand.

Drive a dead farther west til they ran out of land.
We walked five whole minutes to the dark edge of town.
Took a long look at nothing and turned back around.
Oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh.
You know the neutral sky.
And nothing to do at night.
Little highway lights.
They shine.

Under the new sun now.
There coming only alive.
I might be here all the time.
And I share no body no mind.

Under the new sun now.
There coming only alive.
I might be here all the time.
And I share no body no mind.

From the top of the mountain to the rotten sand.
We're driving back, while we're west until it ran out of land.
We walked five whole minutes to the dark edge of town.
Took a long look at nothing and turned back around.
