Effigy Lyrics
by Vision.

If they came and took away.
Everything you are today.
Could you find another way.
All my feelings undermined.
Urged to follow strict design.
And I won't cross that line.

Just an effigy.
What I used to be.
And everything that seemed real.
Was just a dream.

Will you side with faith or fear?
Try to save all that's dear.
They might scream, but I can't hear.
I've got my own cross to bare.
I've still got reason to care.
And in the end, I'm no worse for wear.

Just an effigy.
What I used to be.
And everything that seems real.
Is just a dream.

Will you side with faith or fear?
Try to save all that's dear.
Will you side with faith or fear?
Try to save all that is dear.

Just an effigy.
What I used to be.
And everything that seems real.
Is just a dream.
