Audible Angels Lyrics
by Visionaries.

I told you, you, you, and all of you in the back.
And in the middle in the front yo.

Attention all audible angels.
Before billions burn before brains blow.

Evidently eventually everything ends.
First fascinate friends force foes to fend.
Gradually the greater good grows and graduates.
History has holes however humans hesitate.
I invest indigenous interests.
Journals journey justify jokers jest.
The king of corrupt kings keeps killing kids.
Live for life and love levitating lids.
Money makes many mens minds miss.
Nevermind newness now we need nourish.
Oppose only one organization.
Pray and protect the peaceful population.

Quietly question quality.
Rhettmatic revolutionizes record reality.

Substitute scratches save the songs symmetry.
Twenty six tabs of turntable tapestry.
Understand the underground unsung.
Vegetate vast victorious visions.
Watch the weather wither in the wrong way.
Never Xerox a xenophobes X-ray.
Yes you're young so yell thats just you.
Zoning in the zero of the zyclon zoo.
