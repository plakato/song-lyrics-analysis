What's It All About Lyrics
by Ruse.


Well for me, recievin a reaction.
Reaching out with reason is the reason that I'm rappin.
Readin out speeches, speakin packed with a passion.
Seein crowds cheesin off my tracks, feeling magic.
Yeah, that's it. That's what it's for.
If you're diggin this written, then I got a couple more and.
If you isn't, it's cool. Just come and cut the cord.
Cause I can't waste this illness on an opinion such as yours.
Shootin for the stars, searchin for something more.
Trynna play my part and just touch the core.
Of this whole art. Imma shuffle the cards.
Pick up the board, and drop the game hard.
I'm not what they are, droppin a lame bar.
Trynna act hard. You ain't even at par.
The hole in one holdin a gun called sound.
Drawn out on those wonderin what it's all about, uh.
