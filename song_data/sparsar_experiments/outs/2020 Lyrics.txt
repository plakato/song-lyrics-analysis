2020 Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


2020 but I smoke like I got cataracts.

Smoke like I got cataracts.
2020 but I smoke like I got cataracts.

I Smoke like I got cataracts.
I'm rolling up that stinky pack.
Don't pass me no doodoo pack.
Cuz I don't even fuck with that.
I'm rolling up the blunts of fat.
Man this shit is so obese.
Sour D.
OG smoking til my fucking eyes bleed.
No you can't smoke with me.
Smoking by my fucking self.
I'm hitting up my Cali plug.
I get it off the fucking show.
2020 I see nothing but bad bitches.
Of course I got that good weed I smoke like bad engines.
My trigger finger itching.
I heard them niggas snitching.
They talking like some bitches.
Time to leave em with the fishes.
And now I got ash on my motherfucking clothes.
2020 and I see you don't smoke what I smoke.
Bitch I'm living by the code.
And you niggas not living.
Yeah you smoke but I smoke better.
That ain't the only difference.
In the kitchen you can get witness how I roll weed.
2020 so I better not see what I cease.

Indica or Sativa.
I make you a believer.
How I roll up the reefer.
I'm cruising in the 2 seater.
Its just me and my plug.
He gon' break down enough.
If you thinking I'm slipping.
Then you just might catch a slug.
I'm throwing money at yo bitch while she twerk on the rug.
Yung Smokey I'm a smoker let your bitch do the drugs.
House party getting naughty smoke thot on the beach.
Missed a 7 gram blunt smoking til I can't see.
I'm so high I'm on a plane with no pilot.
I got that real purple and yo weed looking violet.
Don't let me get violent.
Cuz It'll break my silence.
But wait I got that loud pack.
Bitch it ain't no silence.
But wait I got that loud pack.
Bitch it ain't no silence.
Red light blue light I'm ducking on the sirens.
Smoked out loced out hotbox wildin'.
On a highway I roll the blunt and close my eyelids.
