Terminal Lyrics
by The World Alive.


I am a creature.
Who lies in wait.
I'm not the man you think I am.
I will bring you down.

I can't relinquish my grip.
I know that you're breathing but do better than this.
I can't relinquish my grip.
I know that you're breathing but do better than this.

Don't believe in me.
I'll bring you down.
You know I want you to drown.
I'm water in your lungs.
Don't believe in me.
I'll bring you down.

I am the darkness in your life, why you can't sleep at night.
I am the weakness of your mind, your life is mine.
Mine.

I can be, I can be... Who I need to be, need to be.
I am transforming.
I can be, I can be... Who I need to be, need to be.
I am transforming.

I've ruined everything I love.
I've thrown away almost everyone.
I've ruined everything I love.
I've thrown away almost everyone.

Don't believe in me, I'll bring you down. Oh oh oh.
