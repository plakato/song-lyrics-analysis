Killing Kind Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Killing Kind.

Strike two though you're blackened and bruised.
And you're feeling brave now there's nothing to lose.
When all of the lights are focused on you.
There will be no where to hide.

So you open your eyes turn your back of the city.
Never falter, just keep walking.
And into the arms of the next sweet talker.
Lovers daughter God give me shelter.

Cause your love is the killing the kind.
Yeah your love is the killing kind.
Yeah your love is the killing kind.
The killing kind.

You reach the point of no return you're on your own.

Friday nights when you came undone for a little fun.
And you keep them wishing they were in control.

So we open our eyes turn our backs on the city.
Never falter, just keep walking.
And wait for the arms of the next sweet talker.
We crossed and God give us shelter.

Cause your love is the killing the kind.
Yeah your love is the killing kind.
Yeah your love is the killing kind.
The killing kind.

Run to the lake now.
Jump in the cold blue.
We need a vow then.
I will find you.

Run to the lake now.
Jump in the cold blue.
We need a vow then.
I will find you.

Run to the lake now.
Jump in the cold blue.
We need a vow then.
I will find you.

Run to the lake now.
Jump in the cold blue.
We need a vow then.
I will find you.

Cause your love is the killing the kind.
Yeah your love is the killing kind.
The killing kind.
God give me shelter.

The killing kind.
The killing kind.
