Immortal 2K Lyrics
by 5th Ward Boyz.


5Th Ward and Outlawz x6 
 
007 of the 5th Ward, Boyz 
I'm a little lost 
Me and you knowin' nothin', but the hustler 
Mafia life and mob musta 
What, the loss, 5th, Ward, Boyz and Outlawz 
Don't give a fuck who you is 
Bitch. I kill your kids 
You a B, get at your kid. You can 
Fuck the pen 
A Nigga baptized. The sin 
Shots are here: blows of weed and high speed, 
Paddy deep immortal, Niggas ride with me: 
 
E.D.I of the Outlawz 
Is it politics or paper 
Ghetto taxes to enslave us 
Babies die, mommas cry 
Ain't, nobody come and save us 
Better hate and I hate you. Then 
Now hate me cause you can't change. 
Now hate me cause. You blame me of stoppin' this fuckin' thing: 
High sign and high tappin' phone rappin', motherfuckers, 
It's, Rap-A-Lot Mafia, and we at you motherfuckers 
Blast at you, motherfuckers. We, the most T-lawz 
And, the 5th Ward Boyz, join the mob and see the mob 
 
Young Noble of the Outlawz 
Bein' talent than an average jab 
More balanced than an average cat 
Slappin' leg. Last for my stack 
I stab with the track. 
Call me low ends on the 
Oh. You wan na hurt me or blow a controversy 
I'm the motherfuckin' best Nigga after Pac 
After stuck at Rap-A-Lot 
I, can't wait till we drop 
I'm takin' yours with 8-ball 
Bringin', you all 
In, the 5th Ward with them Boyz fuck. It up 
And when we fuckin' it up it ain't FUNNY: 
Niggas got ta, eat, motherfucker, take MONEY, 
, 
All, 
You live the life of crime, 
Blind mine 
Still, find time to gettin' high 
We still ride and we still die 
We die. Even though we try to change in this game, 
Still, 5th, Ward and Outlawz stay remain the same. 
Some aim to get with them: 
Put your guns. In the sky, 
 
One time we all ride 
Outlawz. We multiply 
Bye bye, 
 
E-Rock of the 5th Ward Boyz 
Livin', that mob life. That'S sheist fly 
But, it's real life. 
I put my faith in God hope I don't die tonight. 
It'S critical look in these streets 
Fuckin' with me 
Tried for that Nigga, Pac, screamin', M.O.B 
Cause, it's the mob, bitch 
5th, Ward and Outlawz 
We can't be stopped. 
Rap-A-Lot blowin' up your whole block, 
Rollin' bad beamin', red dots on your head, 
Cockin' squeezin' 
To, your Fubu, like you, bleed so 
Coward guys when you see E-Rock 
Fuckin', these bitch Niggas bustin' nuts, with my Glock 
 
Kastro of the Outlawz 
Gettin' punch-drunk motherfuckin' hoes. In my underwear 
From out the gutter life stink like hootie-hair 
I, been there, that's why I survive anywhere 
Fried. Any tear don't believe this here. 
Yeah these Niggas is lame, tamed as Puff Daddy 
Scared shots out. They Glock when they caught at me, 
Hard scratched me even harder to relax me 
You, a bitch boy and 5th Ward, be body on the bags 
 
Lo-Life of the 5th Ward Boyz 
This shit's comin' from a mile away. 
Don'T make me shit a style a day. 
Lend of shots to your block, 
Till the corners, throw their ride away. 
Ain'T weezin up we heatin' up 
Ready for rush hour, 
Throwin' up gas and powder 
Screamin' money and the power die 
Motherfucker go try your luck up and fuck up 
Don't! Let your smooth chase 
Fool! Your ass, what you gon na hush us 
We did it out the car man 
Put your ass in the ride. 
When Niggas die of homicide, 
, fuckin' sky 
, 
5th, Ward, Boyz and Outlawz x3
