Mind's Eye Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


When the time is right and the night is bright.
We will see the things we've come to find.
I've been searching for just a little more.
But the days girl just slip away.
And the red sunset that we just met girl.
I can see forever.

Come and see the Mind's Eye.
We can find it if we try.
Come and see the Mind's Eye.
Transfixed upon the why.
Come and see the Mind's Eye.
We can find it if we try.

Well they say it's right if it feels alright.
When your love burns up in the mire.
So I burnt a fire for a lost desire.
See it burning higher.

Come and see the Mind's Eye.
We can find it if we try.
Come and see the Mind's Eye.
Transfixed upon the why.

The Mind's Eye.
Right Now.

Come and see the Mind's Eye.
We can find it if we try.
Come and see the Mind's Eye.
We can find it if we try.
