Insane Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

No matter the pain we hide inside.
We all struggle just to feel alive.
It's harder to see the light up ahead.
When you find yourself helpless.

Now let our voices be the change.
So we don't all end up the same.
I can't help but feel this way.
Let's raise our flags to the new way.
We're all insane, in a beautiful way.
We won't change, until the tide comes.
The tide comes.

You'll never be more than what they say.
Unless you stand and face the hate.
Always aware of where you came.
Lead those around you unafraid.

Now let our voices be the change.
So we don't all end up the same.
I can't help but feel this way.
Let's raise our flags to the new way.
We're all insane, in a beautiful way.
We won't change, until the tide comes.
The tide comes.
We're all insane, in a beautiful way.
We won't change, until the tide comes and pulls us all away.

We're all insane.

We're all insane, in a beautiful way.
We won't change, until the tide comes.
The tide comes.

We're all insane, in a beautiful way.
We won't change, until the tide comes.
The tide comes.

We're all insane, in a beautiful way.

We won't change, until the tide comes and pulls us all away.
