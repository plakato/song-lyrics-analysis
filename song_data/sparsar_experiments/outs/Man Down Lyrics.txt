Rolling weed - and she blows me until dis evening - 
Low key, I'm wit, smokey real, discreet, ish, 
Got da creme ting Amm Amm dey need it 
You, see da skeng ting blam blam

Flex wit, my ex wan na press. I tell her: go sleep, ish 
Tryna, sleep, she's tryna beat. I tell her, don't steal it 
Peng ting on instagram like I won't beat it 
She's insta peng. But when I saw her I saw a demon 
You see da hat bitches. They hat

Smoke da weed loads of weed. I am weeded 
O'z for free sold da weed calm, steige ish 
B-B-Bad b tryna beat it. I ain't beating 
She on a hype she's on vibe, like I ain't leaving, 
She sleeps ahh and she eats da like its time for feeding 
Uck party she's naughty. She be

Whizzing round fast lane. We are speeding 
Lidge one fed behind. We are leaving 
Bad b hat on me til. I am screaming 
Rematch USB wan na put my lead in 
Ucking man and she's, loving man. I tell her: leave it 
On the other hand, there's another man: dat will hug and sweet it.
