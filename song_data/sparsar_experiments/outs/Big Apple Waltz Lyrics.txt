Big Apple Waltz Lyrics
by Sweet.

Manhattan Skyline, surround me.
Just like a lady, you're still holding.
Your light burning for me to see.
Cause I'd do most anything.
For all those nights that you bring to me.

All of your love.
I've been so long in the city.
The city has been so long inside of me.
Been so long, it's a pity, I'm so far away.
But I still do The Big Apple Waltz.

I'd buy an empire in any state.
Building the future around you.
Cause where love grows, it's never too late.
We'll paint a heart on the wall.
For the whole of the world to see.

All of my love.
I've been so long in the city.
The city has been so long inside of me.
Been so long, it's a pity, I'm so far away.
But I still do The Big Apple Waltz.

Loving you, is my feeling of dej√°-vu.
Loving you, I know it's true, oh yeah.

We'll paint a heart on the wall.
For the whole of the world to see.

All of our love.
I've been so long in the city.
The city has been so long inside of me.
Been so long, it's a pity, I'm so far away.
But I still do The Big Apple Waltz.

I've been so long in the city.
The city has been so long inside of me.
