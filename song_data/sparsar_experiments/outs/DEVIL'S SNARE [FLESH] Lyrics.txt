DEVIL'S SNARE [FLESH] Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


Don't make a sound.

Let me love you into the ground.

Understand where I'm coming from.
If i get out of hand.
You should double cup.
Right now I'm vulnerable.
And I'm telling you.
There's no stopping me.
But don't be afraid.

Far too long i've been restrained.

Unchain me, i've had enough.
Let me at you, i need a touch.
I don't mean to disregard your feelings.
But I'm tryna warn you.
That i won't be worried about what i'll do to you.
Let's go back.
Back to the basics.
My oasis.
It's only flesh.
Do you need an inhaler?
Cause you got ass, ma.
Just breathe.
And fork over that flesh.

I wouldn't mind.

You mad at me.

Hot ivory.

Bathe in the moonlight.
Malevolence in your eyes.

Knots in your back.

Me on the tip of your tongue.

Give me nowhere to run.

Body me.
Take it all out on me.
Take it all out on me.
I can handle it.

Body me.
Take it all out on me.
Take it all out on me.
Let me handle it.
Let me handle it.

~.
