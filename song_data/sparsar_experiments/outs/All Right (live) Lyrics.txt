All Right (live) Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Looking out.
To the hills, to the setting sun.
I feel a cold wind.
Bound to come;.
Another change.
Another end I cannot see.
But your faithfulness to me.

Is making it all right.
I fall down on my knees;.
Tell me that it's all right.
You give me what I need.
Years of knockin' on heaven's door.
Have taught me this, if nothing more.
That it's all right, what may come.

I've heard it said.
When the river's running high.
You get to higher ground or you die.
Well, muddy waves of pain.
Washed over me.
And it only made me see.

It's gonna be all right.
I, I fall down on my knees;.
Tell me that it's all right.
You give me what I need.
Years of knockin' on heaven's door.
Have taught me this, if nothing more.
That it's all right, what may come.

When will I learn there're no guarantees?
What strengthens hope, my eyes have never seen.
But it won't be long.
Till the faith will be sight.
And the heavens will say.

It's all right.

All right.
I fall down on my knees;.
Tell me that it's all right.
You give me what I need.
Years of knockin'...heaven's door.
Have taught me this, if nothing more.
And it's all right.
Whatever comes.

All right.
Fall on my knees.
Tell me that it's all right.
You give me what I need.
Years of knockin' on heaven's door.

All right.
All right.
I fall down on my knees.
Tell me that it's all right.
Cause you give me what I need.

Years of knockin' on heaven's door.
All right.
Whatever comes, yes sir.
All right.
I fall down on my knees.
All right.
