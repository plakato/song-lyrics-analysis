Let Me Live Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Separate me from the dead all around.
Smashed into the ground.
Ecstasy of killing blinded my eyes.
I cannot remember the day it has begun.
Nor do I know why.
Once I learned to kill and fight.
For a battle that was in sight.
When I'm dreaming.
I still hear them marching on.
In the darkness.
Innocence got ripped.
Out of my heart.
I washed my hands in the blood of.
The man that just have been killed.
The beast in me had risen again.
Gave death into my hands.
Oh, ripping, shooting, burning.
That's the way, that I got drilled.
Menmachine of no remorse.
The killer is deep in me.
When I'm dreaming.
I still hear them maching on.
In the darkness. I start to pray:.
Let me live, let me love again.
Let me drop my head - into your lap.
Let me live - let me love again.
Ease my pain - when I'm home again.
Wondering 'bout what a man is able to take.
Wondering why I'm still alive.
Exodus of humanity, already, it hast begun.
Skulls and bones aroud me.
A bloodbath full of lies.
Insignia of imperfection branded in every face.
