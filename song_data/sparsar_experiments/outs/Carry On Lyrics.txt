Carry On Lyrics
by Unleash The Sky.

Underneath the path of destiny.
There's a seed and it's willing to grow.
As long as we believe in.
As long as we keep searching for.

Carry on no matter what they say.
Carry on better stay on your way.
It's an endless road, an endless fight.
So carry on and make it right.

Our eyes just see an endless road.
Full of sand and stones.
But if we listen to our mind.
We know there's so much more.

We will last together.
We will last forever.
Carry on, you are not alone.
On an endless road full of sand and stones.

Sometimes it's hard to keep your head up high.
Don't stop, don't even wonder why.
It's a drag to carry the weight when no one helps you.

Endless roads and endless fights.
I know.
Carry on and make it right.
We will make it right.
