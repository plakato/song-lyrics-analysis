Gucci Louie Lyrics
by Quan Millz.


Gucci Louie, Prada.
Gucci Louie, Prada.

Gucci Louie, Prada.
Gucci Gucci, Louie, Prada.
Gucci Louie, Prada.
If It's Gucci Louie, Prada.
Gucci Louie, Prada, If It's Gucci Louie, Prada.
Gucci Louie, Prada, It Be Gucci Louie, Prada.
Gucci Louie, Prada, It Be Gucci Louie, Prada.
Gucci Louie, Prada, Gucci Louie, Prada.
Gucci Gucci, Louie, Prada.
Gucci Louie, Prada.

I said I'm all about the Gucci, If It's louie and the prada.
Ralph lauren on my feet It's just a title and the color.
Philly young nigga with the polo on his sweater, I'm always reppin Cities.
Like I put em all together like a puzzle when you fix it.
Woke up in a new Bugatti Veyron, And I Hope I catch a ticket.
If I pull up on the street, I'm turning up the whole block, Straight Ham. G.
Singing wasn't my passion, Niggas growing up like Sammie.
I'm checking in like a hotel with the guest room.
I Guess I'm faded *Trish*.

I ain't worried bout nothin, Got the Gucci on my body.
I'ma run up on you tweakers like the police Arresting niggas Like a hobby.
Ching, Ching, Ching, Money come and returning like a lost puppy.
Throw a hundred G's in the crowd, feeling like I hit the lotto as I'm 19.
Started rapping at a young age, I thought about it at the age of 16.
Niggas started robbing Cars, Seeing life, when they was 14.
Get rich or die trying' this day will be the Sweet dream.
