Lord
by Virtue.


Miracle after miracle.
I can't count the times You undergirded me.
You loosed the chains and removed the shame.
You kept my mind from hurting.

Lord, I thank You.
Lord, I thank You.
Lord, I thank You.
Lord, I thank You.
For You're worthy to be praised;.
I magnify Your name.

Lord, I lift my hands, I bless Your name.
I look back and see.
Where You brought me from.
Through the good and bad.
You remain the same;.
I praise Your name.

So many tears fall.
Just hearing Your name.
My Lord and Savior.
My God and King.

How I love Your name.
It's the sweetest name I know;.
Lord, I lift my hands to Thee.

Lord, I lift my hands.
I bless Your name.
I look back and see.
Where You bought me from;.
Lord, I bow down to worship You.
Lord, I magnify Your name.

Ending:.
Lord, I magnify Your name.
