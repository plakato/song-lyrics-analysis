Everywhere I Go Lyrics
by QED.

I see you everywhere. I go
Can't bring myself to say hello, hello
I'm speakin up like you're new here
I know you want to cause you've made it clear
Everywhere. I go
Everywhere I go
You're there
Is it a coincidence
That everywhere I go
You're there
Could it be. You really care
I got your eye in my direction
You, seem to smile and then walk away
I know we're running the same. Line
You know it's only a matter of time
Everywhere. I go
Everywhere I go
You're there
Is it a coincidence
That everywhere I go
You're there
Could it be you really care
Playing this game of cat and mouse
Is. So exciting
But. Isn'T it about time
That. We cooled the fire
Playing, this game of cat and mouse
Is. So exciting
But. Isn'T it about time
That. We cooled the fire
Everywhere. I go
Everywhere I go
You're there
Is it a coincidence
That everywhere I go
You're there
Could it be you really care
Everywhere. I go
Everywhere I go
You're there
Is it a coincidence
That everywhere I go
You're there
Could it be you really care
Yeah Babe
Everywhere. I go you're there
You're, there
You're there
