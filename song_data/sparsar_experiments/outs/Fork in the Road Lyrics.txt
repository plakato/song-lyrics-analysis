Fork in the Road Lyrics
by Viza.

Keep your kids by the fireplace, sound the alarms there's a storm on the way.
Keep your kids by the fireplace, send out the dogs there's a fork in the road.
Just a fork in the road, a little fork in the road.

Slow down there's a fork in the road you're gonna go down the wrong way.
Slow down there's a fork in the road you're gonna trip along the way.

Keep your kids by the fireplace, raise both your arms if you aren't over age..
No way!
Keep your kids by the fireplace, find me a gun there's a fork in the road.

Slow down there's a fork in the road you're gonna go down the wrong way.

Slow down there's a fork in the road you're gonna trip along the way.

Keep your kids by the fireplace, rat out the mice there's a parrot with no.
brain.
Keep your kids by the fireplace, tell all the sharks there's a fork in the.
road.

Slow down there's a fork in the road you're gonna go down the wrong way.
Slow down there's a fork in the road you're gonna trip along the way.
