40 Lyrics
by Twitchy.


40 days left wheres the gun in my brain.
Fucked me over too much am i goin insane?
Is it not your fault, do i deserve the pain?
You're depressed as fuck, so you remain the same.
At home all day.
Dont talk to anyone got nothing to say.
Screaming out loud, nothing goes my way.
But we both fucked up, its the price to pay.
So we both stop talking.
Go seprate ways and we both start walking.
Hate eachother, we both start mocking.
Get on facebook and we do start blocking.
We do move on.
Said a bunch a bunch things that i thought were wrong.
Why the FUCK can't we get along.
Guess this is where i say so long.
Yeah.

I wake up.
There will be, 39.
More days when.
I wake up, there will be.
39, more days when...

39 days.
Till you touch a razor blade.
So i blow up in your face like a damn grenade.
Come screaming like a raid.
Whyd you let it touch your skin?
Tell me because you wish you were thin.
Wish you were this, wish you were that.
Can i tell you baby that im done with the crap?
So you cry in my face.
Why did you love me in the first place.
I wish these memories i could erase.
Cause we fell to hard in a really wrong place.
I take my clothes back.
They were filed in the corner in a really neat stack.
Now that im gone my scent is what you lack.
Did i really just make another song about you, a whole new track?
Shit.

I wake up.
There will be, 39.
More days left.
When i fall asleep i feel you with me.
When i fall asleep i feel you with me.
When i fall asleep i feel you with me.
Until i fall asleep and you are with me...
