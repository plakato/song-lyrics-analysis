When The Drums Come In At 2
by Wonda.

Late night sex.
No late texts.
What's the odds against that is that a safe bet.
Casino life.
Al Pacino nights.
Feeling gangster.
In this crazy paradise.
Paradise.
When I leave you go.
When I come you stay.
That's how it always goes.
Fuck them other niggas.
Fuck them other niggas.
Just take it back at me.
I ain't touched no other bitches.
Okay I did.
So what.
We sin, we forgive.
You know what.
I ain't got I just try to act like you.
You know how hard it is to grow up.
I'm so grown up.
I act so tough.
I hold back feelings.
It's gotta be so rough on you.
But you still hold up.
With a smile on your face but you're so turned up.

Youre acting crazy right now but when the drums come in.
I wonder if you'll lose it.
Youre acting crazy right now but when the drums come in.
I wonder if you'll lose it.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Just do it.

Youre acting crazy right now but when the drums come in.
I wonder if you'll lose it.
Youre acting crazy right now but when the drums come in.
I wonder if you'll lose it.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Just do it.

Cr-crazy right now.
Cr-cra-crazy right now.
Cr-cra-crazy right now.

I don't mean to hurt you baby.
Don't even deserve you baby.
I'll be on my way to labour.
I ain't got no curfew baby.
No I said hey just be patient.
Patience is a virtue baby.
The reservation for that dinner.
Did I mean to desert you baby.
And that was before the ontre.
Got a call from my nigga Andre.
Who say anythin' he just say.
One cali and a beyonce.
And they both wanna play.
So what am I supposed to say.
So unfaded so un-vacant.
In chicago but the lights are shining brighter than vegas.
I got lost in a condo.
I met two twins.
Tia and Gia.
We had geodonos.
They was from out of town.
They was heading back tomorrow.
Popping bottles on some real.
You hate when I'm drunk but you deal with it.
Because I might be your male figure.
If I broke your heart tonight could I live with it.
