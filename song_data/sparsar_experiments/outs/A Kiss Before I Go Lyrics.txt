A Kiss Before I Go Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

The engine turns on a dime.
But I ain't going nowhere tonight.
I ain't been going nowhere for quite a while.
Can't tell the truth in a house of lies.
Can't explain what I don't know.
One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go.

One more kiss 'fore I go.
One more night and day.
Breath all heavy and slow.
One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go.

I'll miss those nights at the bar.
With every girl all loaded like freights.
And the pain in the morning comes as easy as it goes.
Can't find the truth in a house of lies.
And you can't see tomorrow with yesterday's eyes.
One shot, one beer and a place where nobody cries.

One more kiss 'fore I go.
One more night and day.
Breath all heavy and slow.
One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go.
