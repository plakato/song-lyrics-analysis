2 AM Interlude Lyrics
by Swelo.

Hey.

Hey.

I'm walkin' down the street again.
Mind on a gun again.
Think of things I shoulda said.
I guess that I messed up again.
Again.

Hoo hooo.
Hoo hooo.

Chill out baby.
Baby cool down baby.
Baby chill out baby.
Baby cool down.

Chill out baby.
Baby cool down baby.
Baby chill out baby.
Baby cool down.

Hoo hooo.
Hoo hooo.

Hey.

Hey.

Chill out baby.
Baby cool down baby.
Baby chill out baby.
Baby cool down.

Chill out baby.
Baby cool down baby.
Baby chill out baby.
Baby cool down.
