In the Water Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.


Hey!
Hey!

There's something in the water.
There's something in the light.
Dancing in the corner.
Taken by the night.

There's something in the way it shapes the rain.
Breaking through the drum.
There's something in the water.
Something that'll take us ho-ome.

Tell me what you said, something about a dream.
I got an ocean, I got an ocean in me.
Tell me what it meant, something to keep it real.
I got an ocean, I got an ocean in me.

Tell me what you said, something about a dream.

There's something in the water.
There's something in the night.
Dancing in the corner.
Taken by the light.

There's something in the way it breaks the wave.
Chase him 'fore you go.
There's something in the water.
Something that'll take us ho-ome.

On and on we fall into our lovers arms.
On and on we fall into our lovers arms.
On and on we fall into our lovers arms.

There's something in the water.

There's something in the light.
There's something in the water.

There's something in the light.
There's something in the water.

There's something in the light.

There's something in the water.

There's something in the light.

There's something in the water.

There's something in the light.

There's something in the water.

There's something in the light.
