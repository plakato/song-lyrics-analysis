A Kind of Magic Lyrics
by Queen.


It's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic.
A kind of magic - no way.

One dream, one soul, one prize.
One goal, one golden glance of what should be.
It's a kind of magic.
One shaft of light that shows the way.
No mortal man can win this day.
It's a kind of magic.
The bell that rings inside your mind.
Is challenging the doors of time.
It's a kind of magic.
The waiting seems eternity.
The day will dawn of sanity.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic.
There can be only one.
This rage that lasts a thousand years.
Will soon be done.
This flame that burns inside of me.
I'm hearing secret harmonies.
It's a kind of magic.
The bell that rings inside your mind.
Is challenging the doors of time.

It's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic.

This rage that lasts a thousand years.
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done.
This is  a kind  of magic.
There can be only one one one one.
This rage that lasts a thousand years.
Will soon be done - done.

Magic - it's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic.
Magic magic magic.
Ha ha ha haa - it's magic.
Ha haa.
Yeah yeah.
Wooh.
