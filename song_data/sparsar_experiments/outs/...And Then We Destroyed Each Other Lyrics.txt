...And Then We Destroyed Each Other Lyrics
by Volcanoes.

How can you love me forever if you're already dead?
Your heart stops beating every time we touch.
Girl I can see right through you, and God it ain't pretty, Girl you can see.
right through me and oh, God it's a mess.

How many times must we go through this?
How ever many times it takes.
I'm not ok and you're not ok, and man it'll never be ok.
I think I'll start a metal band, and scream until I throw up.
I think I'll start a metal band and write songs about how we're all messed up.

Now I can't listen to love songs anymore.
But it's cool man â€˜cause I got other stuff to listen to.
Like my conscience telling me to get the hell out.
God I need some help, I need an answer, I need someone to give me something I.
need, not what I want GOD, I NEED SOME HELP.
