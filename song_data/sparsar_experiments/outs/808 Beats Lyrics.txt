808 Beats Lyrics
by The Unknown DJ.

Beat by beat baby, rhyme by rhyme.
My body's shaking, heart is aching, just to make you mine.
So as you dance to my music and your body drips sweat.
Here are the words you should never forget.

I am the prince of desire, the King of your dreams.
And there will never be another in your life like me.
Cause I'm so tall, dark and handsome and claiming to be.
The hardest lover undercover of the M.I.C.

From New York to London, from Watts to Rome.
My beat is thumping, feet are jumping for DJ Unknown.
Computerized musician with the futuristic beat.
The bass in your face, the chord's so unique.

I am the music of the future, the sound of the street.
Chosen me the supersceder of the humdrum beat.
Though the music's devastating it was simple to create.
Cause I am the master of the 808........so Beat this!
