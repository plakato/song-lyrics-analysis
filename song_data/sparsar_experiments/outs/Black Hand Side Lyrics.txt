Black Hand Side Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.


Ooh, baby baby.
Aww yeah.
Clap your hands y'all).

Check it!
Dig it while I rip it.
Check it while I wreck it.

Okay, gimme a few seconds.
First, I give a shout to every.
Jersey-born-and-bred head.
And everybody in New York.
From brunettes to red heads.
Who got my back?
Yo, tell me who got my back?
Yo, tell me who got my back?
Yo-yo-yo who got my back?
Thank you as I come back into the beat.
Give a shoutout to my brother L.A.N.C.E.
Up in heaven, resting,.
chilling, watching over me.
You know you're too good to be forgotten.
Papa wasn't there but.
there was Lance in the house.
And so, to me and Mommy, you the man of the house.
Always flip the script back to the old days.
I used to rock it on the high school stage.
I used to drink 40s.
Back then I didn't blaze.
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days.
Just go on to let you know I flow on.
I'm wicked out my gluteus, so ho on and ho on.
That's what we about to do.
Take you on a mission with the Flavor U.
Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop.
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop.

But chill.

Just chill.

Yo chill.

Uh.

Come on chill.

Check it fear don't live in here.
Tears don't bring me cheers.
So gear for another year because I had it up to here.
Yeah, I'm about through with you.
You wack and rooty poo.
Rip up a crew after I hear the one and the two.
I'm ret' to set it off again.
Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin?
In fact, don't make me have to get the royal gatt.
You best to get your narrow ass off that crack.
We'll play any show and I know that I'll pack it.
Attack it with my tactics.
I'm loaded like a full metal jacket.
I flip mines to get mines.
I'm happy to get with you.
But you can't come out to play right now.
You got to much shit to do.
It's all game.
It all sounds the same.
Them suckers know my name is.
Sitting on the tips of their brains.
But they're ashamed.
They scared to face me.
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me.
They must be freaking crazy.
I'm the La La La from Halstead.
Bred with the Queen as a prefix.
It's off with your head.
And that's a promise cause I don't make threats.
So mind your neck, cause it's about to get set.

C'mon set it off.

Uh, set it off.

Somebody set it off.

Watch the La, set it off.

Uh, set it off.

Uh, set it off.

Watch the La, set it off.

Checks the Queen, set it off.

Parlay.
Ah uh, yeah.
Black reign 1993.
I'd like to welcome you to this album.
Matter of fact, I'd like to welcome you to a new day.
A new day to hear me.
Check this out ya'll.
