Starless & Shadow Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


For the ones.
Empty as the night sky.
Who our voice.
Doesn't dare speak of.
Set us free.
High above the dark road.
You are called.
Starless &amp; Shadow.

It is infinite.
There is nothing now.
Beyond the edge.
As the night does fall.
See us through.
Until the break of day.
