Psychopath Lyrics
by Virus Syndicate.


Adrenalin filling my right leg blood rush through my body and feeling just.
like head.
Lust it can turn to disgust in just a second.
When you buss wanna crush with a caliber weapon.
I'm in love with that mother fucker up in the mirror.
Give me some drugs and I flip into some killer gorilla.
You fucking mugs! Clearing out ya villa for scrilla.
I'm going nuts putting slugs up in ya figure.

I did a couple of tours and made scrilla.
Jayzilla, I'm a guerrilla I stay illa.
Jays in a league of his own I came with the eyes of a hawk, knife and a fork.
coz your dinner.
Type the report, write with the chalk I'm your killa.
You tried to abort mission.
Then had to report missing.
I'm back to the war listen.
It's back to the raw spitting.
You act like its your kitchen.
I cook em like raw chicken.

My girlfriends a prostitue and loves it.
I'm riddled with diseases just from everytime she sucks it.
Luckily I buss quick.
Cannon fire up! now I'm tryna cut a deal with the Dallas buyers club.
Sharing needles with a lepor liking I'm living forever.
Head spotted like a leopard looking redder than pepper.
Stomach gutted on the checkered floor bloody machete.
My body parts overboard throwing up on the jetty.

Psychopath x 8.

I terror any riddim.
Clinical terrorism.
Physical hedonism.
Lyrical separatism.
Spiritual exorcism.
I'm Hannibal lectorin em.
Fuck all the pessimism.
I kill all the Scepticism.
Rhymes are on another level above.
An you'll never measure with em.
Raised in the city guns, cotton and hella women.
Raining on the game while they're staining to bring the weather with them,.
step into the war with a sword and them man are never winning.

Psychopath x 8.
