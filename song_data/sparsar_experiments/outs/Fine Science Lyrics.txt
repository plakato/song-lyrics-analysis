Fine Science Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Tear from me, my flesh;.
The breast covering my heart.
A dog is all that you are.

But I reached my hand into the cage.
I've been screaming til my throat was raw.
Calling out your name.

And I still feel ashamed.
Constantly blaming myself.
And I can't feel the rainâ€¦
Through all the embers.

My tongues been caught behind:.
The teeth of a liar.
Oh, now I can taste the blood.
I taste the iron.

This air is sickening.
And there's none left to grieve.
They'll come home.
They always come home.

You think yourself a breaker of these:.
Bases crumbling under my feet.
I swear, you can not break my foundation.
My friend, I laid its mortar from my bones.

Weak. You are weak.

I told myself that we were safe.
I never checked under my bed.
For monsters or evil men.
But no-one ever did.

Don't dare close your eyes.
Not even for a second.
You don't deserve the rest.
That you left for them.

Spineless, I'm gonna find you.
Don't let me catch you here.
Spineless, I'll fucking find you.
