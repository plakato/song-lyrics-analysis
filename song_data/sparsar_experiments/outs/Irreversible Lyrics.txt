Irreversible Lyrics
by Xilent.

Turn.
Turn away.
The first time.
I can't say.
But heaven knows.
I'll fade.
Before.
I grew.
Into these.
Old shoes.
I kissed away.
All my years.

Irreversible moments of my life.
Irreversible stuck in overdrive.
Don't.
Leave me yet.

One.
One-way ride.
To the stars.
Of your eyes.
To slip away.
Inside.
Across.
Time I fall.
Saw the light.
Of the world.
Touch your skin.
I caved in.

Irreversible moments of my life.
Irreversible stuck in overdrive.
Don't.
Leave me yet.
Don't.
Leave me yet.

And before I could come.
Yes something you should know.
How I feel alone.
Where you go.
I'm terrified.

Heaven might say.
Who's on my side.

Irreversible moments of my life.
Irreversible stuck in overdrive.
Irreversible as it turns my life.

It's you and I.
It's you and I.
It's you and I.
