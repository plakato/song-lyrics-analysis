C' mon - live in japan Lyrics
by The Runaways.

Don't turn away, I know you feel it.
If you want me love, you don't have to steal it.
Your eyes they beg, the tears you fashion up.
Gonna get involved in the nature of love.
C'mon, c'mon.
You know you make me want you.
C'mon, oh, c'mon.
It's getting late, we made a start now.
I can't talk about that love anyhow.
Your eyes are wide, your body's shakin'.
I got the hives my soul is achin'.
C'mon, c'mon.
You know you make me want you.
C'mon, oh c'mon.
Hot throat, to race this love I have.
You're one of a kind, don't want no other.
Love is your thing you keep my style.
Clean me out with an easy smile.
C'mon, c'mon.
You know you make me want you.
C'mon, oh c'mon.
