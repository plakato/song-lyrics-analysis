All my fault Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


Here we go again, I am not your friend.
I am not your enemy.
I am just a ghost, I am just a thought.
I am just an entity.
Save yourself, go away, please don't believe in me.
I will just cause pain, I will just cause hurt.
And I want you to see.

Every single day we feel different things.
But today, yes today, oh, I feel nothing.
Every time you sleep, please remember me.
Maybe tomorrow, after the sorrow, I'll be on to better things.

Tear me up again, I want to pretend.
That I am part of everything.
I am just a breath, I am just a touch.
I am just reality.
Save yourself, go away, please don't believe in me.
I will just cause pain, I will just cause hurt.
So I want you to see.
