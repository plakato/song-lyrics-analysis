Back Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.


Darling you a angel.
Feelings getting tangled.
Forget they looking at you with they Head at an angle move.
Back back.
Move.
And forth.
Move.
Back.
Move move move.
Grove with the beat.
And bust a move to the rhythm.
Use these haters on your back to energize your system.
Move.
Back.
Move Forth.

Hold up a second who you want to see you naked.
Because as far as i can tell you looking good no point in stressing.
When you get so insecure i Mean your body is a blessing.
Yeah your body is a temple let nobody tell you different.
All these dudes that you attract.
Be getting me and cousin act.
Making me quickly react.
And Anthony You should Subtract.
Those type of dudes don't interact with.
Or even make eye contact with.
He just going to cause distraction.
Make me mad you going to have to hold me.
Don't get caught in media society criteria.
Yeah that's not the right area.
Like you think cafeterias.
Are places where your serious.
And do what I think dangerous.
Girl believe your alias.
Your alias spontaneous.
Them others miscellaneous.
But never to your cranium.
You Have nothing to say to them.
Your beautiful in every way.
Your cousin is just here to say.
That oh girl you be thinking cray.
Now stand up and just dance with me like.

I bet it's hard for you.
Look for one to play the part for you.
The one that will work hard for.
Every moment look out for you.
At the gym work out for you.
Probably won't work out but you.
Put on make-up trying to make up.
Like Sanaa Lathan.
You looking for Mr. Right so you can go and date him.
And end crying to me every time that he he was faking.
End up Saying Davin why is guys so complicating.
I say please just show them patience.
Because they wasn't worth it.
They couldn't play the part because they can't take your perfect.
Because darling you an angel.
Feelings getting tangled.
Out of all these guys not a single one changed you.
If it was up to me then I would take you.
Back before you'd wake up put make-up on.
John outside the door why you take so long.
But he don't understand.
Only I can.
So take my hand and dance while we saying.
