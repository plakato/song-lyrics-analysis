I dont Know Lyrics
by Unkown.

Ill strangle you with a thick rope, and wrap you around in a rain coat, then.
drag your body across the dang road, Then put you inside the trunk of my rove,.
then reach the ocean and roll you down the stream in a boat, And wake up the.
next morning to eggs and toast, I show no remorse to those who want a war,And.
im ready for anything to pop off, I put guns down and my hands up, If shit.
does get popping then im shooting all your hats off, And my homies are all.
trained so prepare for headshots.
