Lemme Go Lyrics
by Wonda.


Say you'll never let me go.

Need You.
Need To ....
Love You.
Leave You.
I would be a fool to.
And if I ever lose you.
And somebody fucked you.
Do you know what I would do to you?

Take my Glock twenty-two.
Aim it, red light on dude.
Prolly end up on the news.
All I do, is point and shoot.

Say you'll never let me go before I have to let it go.

Say It.
Say It.

I want you to.
Love me and.
Miss me and.
Fuck me.
Like nothing else matters.
Whenever we fuckin'.
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah.
Do ya wanna know what I'd do to ya.
If I....
Ever....
Ever found out another nigga ran through ya.
Oh no....

I'd take my Glock twenty-two.
Aim that red light at dude.
Prolly end up on the news.
Blow his head through the roof.
While you screaming Don't shoot!
But it's too late for that.
Baby just say it back.
Say it.

Say It.
Say It.

If he ever fuck ya lights out.
Ya better not let me find out.
Say you'll never let me.
Lemme go.
Say you love me.

If he ever fuck ya lights out.
Better not let me find out.
Say you'll never.
Say you'll never.
Say you'll never.

If he ever fuck ya lights out.
Better never let me find out.
Say you'll never lemme.
Lemme.
Lemme Go.
Better never lemme find out.
Say you'll never lemme.
Lemme.
Lemme Go.

My Glock twenty-two.
Red light on dude.
End up on the news.

If he ever fuck ya lights out.
Ya better not let me find out.
Say you'll never let me go.
Lemme.
Lemme Go Whoa.
Better never lemme find out.
Say you'll neber lemme.
Lemme.

Say It.
Say It.
