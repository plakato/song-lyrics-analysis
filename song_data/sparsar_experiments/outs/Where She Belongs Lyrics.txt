Where She Belongs Lyrics
by Swazi Jive Entertainment.


If we travel tonight you gon' pose for the camera.
All the smoking and drinking that's all you can handle.
Promise you baby.
I got some shit for ya.
You gon' make this the night that you never remember.

Club goin' up.
Poppin' bottles girl I know you love it.
And these niggas trynna cuff you girl.
But you ain't fucking with 'em baby.
I know who you fucking with.
I know who you fuckig with.
I'm a lord, fuck a peasant.
I'm only fucking with that top shelf work.
I got it wrapped like a present.
All this shit new to you.
Girl you nervous I know that.
But you in my world now.
And it's too late to go back.
Already addicted to strobe lights.
Sure she been up for a fortnight.
Sippin', smokin', sniffin'.
Turned into a monster.
?

Hit the club when the Sun up.
Then we ? and she know the deal.
She like to fuck before it come down.
So I gotta come again and again.
Again and again.
She love it you but she callin me.
?
