Disrespect Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


I, don't take no disrespect, 
Nigga, don't try my set 
Nigga. Don'T try my set 
Nigga. Don'T try my set 
 
I. Don'T take no disrespect 
Nigga, don't try my set 
All, my niggas gon' wet 
All. My niggas be vets. 
 
Bitch, I'm from a fucking state where niggas die, like 
The murder rate in this state. Stay high, like 
You, could die in the store or in the parking lot. 
In the shitty ass weather, where it stay hot 
Everybody hate life cause they ain't rich 
Robbing. Out of town niggas cause, they flexing shit 
The only time these fucking hoes gon na be on your dick 
Is. When you riding in a Benz on some fly shit 
Fuck these stupid, ass hoes cause they ain't shit 
They get killed here too cause they suck dick 
You see the yankees in they zones running fucking shit, 
And them dreads, always busting good bitch, 
But, I'm a Yank! So you know I'mma rep, this shit 
With, my American flag, flexing on your bitch 
You, better, keep your eyes open in this Florida. Shit, 
This, shit, hell man! These niggas here will shoot you bitch 
 
I, don't take no disrespect 
Cause! All my niggas gon wet 
We. In this bitch you know we deep and all my niggas be vets 
Man. All my niggas grip, tecs 
Fuck hoes in they 
Don't take no disrespect. We be wilding on the set 
We smoking on the best. You can feel it in your chest. 
And your girl. She see a vet, but I only want the neck 
Big dog status and you boys is at the vet. 
See me walk up on a nigga put the banger to his chest. 
Then I fade off in the night hella geeking, with your wife, 
I'm, the smoothie king nigga mix, the lean with the sprite 
Red beam, rubber grip, 
Hitting, everything in sight, 
Red beam, rubber grip, 
Hitting, everything in sight,
