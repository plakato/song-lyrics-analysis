Russian Roulette Lyrics
by Word A' Mouth.


I ain't scared to play.. Let me see that. What you doin 
Your, not playin, this game. Right., You got ta spin, it spin it 
Just like that. Spin, the barrel. I'mma try it 
Spin the barrel Watch. I ain't scared. Watch this watch, *gunshot* 
, 
Thirstin, Howl, 
Poured, blood, ignored love, even Thor trusted a little devil 
In. All us, the motor that keeps cheatin wives, lawns, cut, 
At a fallen temperature before I'm even warmed up 
At the speed of thought. Thug niggas fight for a needless cause. 
All you hear is stop the stealing when nearin stores, 
Uncommon Valour with the French make players take the bench 
Above the rim, without touchin the net 
Thirsty greedy, sometimes desperate 
When. I lock rap down I'mma booby trap the exit 
Barracade, the entrance turn demonics screamin into harmless kids, 
Whispers, no challengers 
Winnin the belt. If I say I'm top notch, I'd be just limitin myself. 
Mc'S bore me like elevator, music, 
Street panhandlers, with three-socket sewage, 
All, A
