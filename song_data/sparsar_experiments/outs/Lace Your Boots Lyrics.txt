Lace Your Boots Lyrics
by 4th25.


I know im not what your used to.
Too real for all that fruit stuff.
Revealing perpetrators though they hide.
Just throw your truce up.

No time for all that new stuff.
Frontin on that who what.
I could give a fuck about you niggas.
Pick your tools up.

Its war, lace your boots up.
Its real, fuck the rules bro.
Close contact one hand combat.
Or long distance fuck you fools up.

Back in the saddle now.
Back up in the battleground.
If its in your heart when it sparks.
Act according now.

The object man slaughter now.
The order shut these fools down.
The target, anything moving.
Women and children catching slugs now.

No love so don't come around.
Run for the border now.
Head shots are the standard.
Got no time for no second rounds.

Down from the start to finish.
Niggas talk it but I live it.
True to the heart though its hard.
Im still up in it.

Business is my personal.
Pain if I touch a few.
Fuck your life my nig.
And look here, take it personal.

I keep my boots laced tight as fuck.
In god I trust.
These mo'fuckers can't be stupid enough.
Not to throw they truce up.

But fuck 'em, No this is not love.
This is death bout to touch 'em.
This is anything moving.
Becoming the new focus of my weapon.

This is with each breath I take in.
Bein the last one they takin.
This is me askin gods forgiveness.
For all the souls at his gate waitin.

All the clothes we left on lifeless bodies.
White flags could a saved em.
But they refuse to chose to wave 'em.
So I refuse not to spray 'em, fuckem.

That's why they stay.
With they face to the pavement prayin.
To god they don't get weighed in.
Cause we are not playin.

We are on top of this foodchain.
And they could never evolve past us.
And though we'd see this solved peacefully.
They mistakenly come after us.

But they never seem to be able to handle.
The repercussions afterwards.
When the dust settles and they finally realize.
They should have been pacifists.

But its too late to switch.
After this full metal jacket grabs em.
Look we toldem this was war.
And we toldem we get at em.
This is warâ€¦

I don been to war in all seasons.
Gave a whole new meanin to block bleedin.
I done seen some of the hardest cats shot.
On the ground screamin.

Exercising these demons.
From the souls of my enemies.
My mouth never moves.

Casket closed friend or foe.
When its my time I'll never know.
Don't catch bullets always.
Let my bullets go.

Squeeze till its nothing left.
Protect my buddy protect my self.
Gotta make it home so i.
Fight till my last breathe.

Never mind these fucked up rules.
If he can break 'em so can you.
If he talk shit best believe.
That im gone killem fool.

A dead man can't talk.
Fuckem is what im talking about.
Only story getting told.
Is the story coming out my mouth.

Its war, ain't no rules here.
My enemies made that real clear.
Explosives under the street.
The only thing that I'm fearing here.

No time to make my first mistake.
Be on point wit each chance I take.
Gotta stay focused just to.
Make it to the next day.

My eyes are open never shut.
Holdin a weapon blow 'em up.
When my boots are laced up.
Best believe im not given a fuck.

I'm giving all my rounds away.
Hell naw I ain't stingy bro.
He can take 'em all or he better.
Throw his truce up, its war.
