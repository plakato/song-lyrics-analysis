This Step (Ft. Jose Cotto) Lyrics
by Swelo.


Started when we met one night.
And now you're by my side.
Thought we were doing fine.
But now you're acting strange.
Feels like something has changed.
You're asking if we'll stay.
Together.

Well I know you need to know.
And I know you need to see.
Well I don't think you should go.
‘Cuz it looks like this to me.

Ohh oh, it started at this step.
And now we can't.
Go back again.
And you know.
We probably mis-stepped.
But now I don't want to go home.

Girl, your heart is a therapeutic mattress that I want to rest my soul on.
And I apologize if I'm coming off too strong.
But I've been feeling this way for so long.
You see.
I've been trying to live this moment out in my head for years now.
Coming up with every possible scenario.
Just to ensure that this doesn't go wrong.
And I know that now had to be the time to tell you because.
I could not let this feeling go on.
Any longer.
Ever since the moment I saw you.
I knew that She was you.
My soul-mate.
You know, the person we all see in our mind's eye view.
A picture so perfect, a picture of you.
A picture that says a thousand words.
But the only ones that matter are: “I love you”.
But since I've seen that picture.
I've been working hard on dismantling the frame.
In order to put myself in it.
And I know that may sound selfish, but.
I just know deep down in my heart.
That this beautiful image I see.
Can turn into a masterpiece.
Magnum opus, my greatest work of art.
Once it becomes a picture of you.
And me.
