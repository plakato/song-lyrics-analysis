Slam Dunk (Way To Go) Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Slam dunk - way to go!
What do ya say, Let's rock 'n roll.

Well I come to play and I play to win.
Just say the word and I'll stuff it in.
I'm gonna slam it all the way.
Dunk it, what do you say.

When the whistle blows I'm gonna fly the coup.
Just pump me up and watch me shoot.
Slam it - Touch the rim.
Dunk it - Thrust it in.

I won't sing no sweet romantic song.
But I can do ya, I can do ya.
You'll never know right from wrong.
Here we go.

Slam dunk way to go.
What do you say, let's rock 'n roll.
Slam dunk climb the pole.
Drive through the middle and jam it home.
Slam dunk.
Take control, pick it up baby.
Let's do it some more.
Pick it baby, Let's do it some more.
That's right.

I want two, four, six, eight, ten and more.
A wham-bam shooter I love to score.
Jam it - Bump and grind!
Pump it! -- Come on do it right!

Shake it o the left, fake it to the right.
Dunk it in the bucket, it feels alright.
Jam it -- bump and grind.
Pump it.

Well, I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed.
I can double your trouble and triple your body heat.
Just like this.

Slam dunk way to go.
What do you say, let's rock 'n roll.
Slam dunk climb the pole.
Drive through the middle and jam it home.
Slam dunk.
Take control, pick it up baby.
Let's do it some more.
Pick it baby, Let's do it some more.

Well, I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed.
I can double your trouble and triple your body heat.

Slam dunk way to go.
What do you say, let's rock 'n roll.
Slam dunk climb the pole.
Drive through the middle and jam it home.
Slam dunk.
Take control, pick it up baby.
Let's do it some more.
Slam dunk way to go.
Go, go let's go.
Slam dunk.
Take control, pick it up baby.
Let's do it some more.
Pick it up baby.
Let's do it some more.
