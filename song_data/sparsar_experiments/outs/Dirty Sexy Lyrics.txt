Dirty Sexy Lyrics
by Rusko.

Got my swag right, and my stacks high.
Got the hair done, nails done, so fly.
You see me struttin' out.
Karats dripping down.
Couple grand keep me six inches off the ground.
Paying off your debt, for the hell of it.
I'm a pimp! I'm a pimp!
I don't need your pockets, boy you know I got it.
Everything I have, I bought it.

You step into the baddest, welcome to my show.
Stuntin' is a habit, baby, you already know.
Got the top down, and the beat rock loud.
And you there ain't no stopping us now.
Spending this dirty sexy money.
If you ain't trickin' then you better just slide.
Millionaire's jealous of the way we ride.
Spending this dirty sexy money.

Wings on the car, slidin' black cards.
Jet ski on the beach, backyard.
40 on my wrist, Dior on my lips.
The way I put it together might make your head twist.
Steady rockin' up the AirMiles just to floss.
I'm a pimp! I'm a pimp!
Throwin' money in the air cause I'm a boss.

You step into the baddest, welcome to my show.
Stuntin' is a habit, baby, you already know.
Got the top down, and the beat rock loud.
And you there ain't no stopping us now.
Spending this dirty sexy money.
If you ain't trickin' then you better just slide.
Millionaire's jealous of the way we ride.
Spending this Dirty Sexy money.
