From Me Lyrics
by Zio zane.


Good night folks , I just bought a.
new clock.
Am or Pm all I hear is tic toc.

They don't wanna see me on my toes right ?

Man a lot of ya'll really kinda want it.
Miles away , Maserati I be back wit.
it.
City on the map and the fam in the.
mansion.
We are not the same I ain't even gotta mention.
Tell me what the fuck you want from me.

What the fuck you want from me.

So what the fuck you want from me.

I say what the fuck you want from me want from me hahh.

Can't stand an artificial got respect from the realest.
Motivation from the legends got me up on Everest.
This is for the ones showing love a flower from my inner.
Up all night cooking your dinner S.A top chef homie I'm the winner.
Young nigga fit for the street don't mistake for muscles.
I told myself imma hustle till my castle can stand.
Then my life be built like a puzzle.
Gotta be resourceful or you gon lose a piece.
Got niggas in the grave still throwing up thizz.
R.I.P to the gods I'm talking D.R.E.
All these new broads can't stand and pee.
It's going down man I'm outta here.
Where my car keys at.
Fuck the gas on E.
Where my Visa at.
5 niggas with attitude bitch I'm Easy E.

Man a lot of ya'll really kinda want it.
Miles away , Maserati I be back wit it.
City on the map and the fam in the mansion.
We are not the same I ain't even gotta mention.
Tell me what the fuck you want from me.

What the fuck you want from me.

So what the fuck you want from me.

I say what the fuck you want from me want from me hahh.

There's a lot of bitch niggas in this music bizness.
I do my shit dolo so no santa claus on Christmas.
You can die for this niggas but there'll still wanna murk you.
Guess that's why Jesus had to leave who then walked in his shoes.
Issues.
Connect to my dream then you be used to getting cream.
Cuz I'm from mercury and we always exposed to sunbeams.
That's why I got massive melanin in my fuckin dark skin.
And bitch I'm lovin' it like I'm.
MacDonald let's say Burger King.
Bigger than ever and smaller than later.
I'm the future, in your birth certificate first name ''Hater''.
My nigga fuck that shit you talking 'bout.
My music always speaking loud.
Like what the fuck it's all about.
Topics rappers can't bring man I'm out.

Man a lot of ya'll really kinda want it.
Miles away , Maserati I be back wit it.
City on the map and the fam in the mansion.
We are not the same I ain't even gotta mention.
Tell me what the fuck you want from me.

What the fuck you want from me.

So what the fuck you want from me.

I say what the fuck you want from me want from me hahh.

InZane hun ! don't fall for anything.
I'm Ready ,InZane ,Majestic.
