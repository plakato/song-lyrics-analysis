Teal Chords Lyrics
by Tyler Major.


He'S eyein all the rookies 
He's, seen it for awhile now and every day its spooky 
Laughin past seasons, ash the hourglass is half the empty 
Next cup -- -dvd dvr us plus the cassette's stuck 
Never blame the stereo. You ballhawk 
Snatch catcher hall of famer passer for the aw shocks, 
Write down your secret recipe for the potluck 
And watch national tv pleease, no more shots. duck 
\ -- its for the lighty vixen in the teal chords 
Slide into her wishing well with pennies for her. You and yours, 
The, corner stores, dont, have it -- wrap it in plastic, 
Double duties for his fast cars, slapsticks 
Thats, rich --, who you know considered a myth, 
Takin trips of all sorts, but dont go nowhere, but his room and sits 
\ -- recognize the philosophy. 
No matter their whereabouts, at the end of the day, its just a hypocrisy, 
 
Same moves different day. Junkies, 

Demoness monks bleed papes throughout space, 
\ -- -they move with every inching step, girating to a lounging pace, 
Fully flegeded, on the thoughts that they think about him. 
Held em to every word, held him hostage. We'Ve got you surrounded, 
They yelled. It like it was their very last breath 
If. He died at this second, his last step, would've been the reject 
Ooo geez it kinda got real there. 
Life is like a movie shoot --. The cameras can't shoot in here, 
\ --. Then they move it to a different place: 

\ --, -at least thats. What i heard them say: 
Marry her fountain. I heard it drips once every thursday 
Came up with the cake like at the bridal shower 
Indulge. In all the eatings of these wannabee rhyming emcees, then scour
