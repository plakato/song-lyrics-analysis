Keel Lyrics
by Volcano Choir.

The propheteer.
The prophet's here.
Only 'til August.
Bearing down into the grass, down into the grass for me.

The prophet's come.
The prophet's good and stung.
Gobbled up on cable wires.
Dangling low + above the fires.
They won't work out like the lovely ones.
High wires.
That bring the heathens out for a fight.
Ergo sum.
The game's grown young.
There's a danger now in the town below.

And the hobble of gawker's look across onto the road.
There's a tazor.
And a brave young one.
Spilling fiber like you, son.
And the cherry pouts your lungs.

Just stay here.
Stay here just loving me.
Or just STOP bloody loving me.
See now.
Sweep behind the gauzy curtain.
High rise.
High + wild.

I pick at you, my limestone.
When you fiddle with your red stone.
What are you without your flint then, sonny?

Can't count out your only lie.
Can't you cap out your only lie.
Sitting fore.
Keel.........

Not before.
I was in front.
Of the pekid fountain.
The whole time.
