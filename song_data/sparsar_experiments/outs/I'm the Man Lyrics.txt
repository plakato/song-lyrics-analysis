, 
I came in the world cryin' and fussin' 
Nigga. We ain't have nothin' 
Every ghetto. I know the same 
We trying to make a little change. 
Preacher man come around talkin' 
I, don't wan na hear it keep walkin' 
I'mma put the powder in the pot 
Whip it'till, I'm pullin' off a lot 
Imagine. When I pull it off the lot. 
New shit come without a top 
Once I'm on. I ain't never gon' stop 
Bitch, I'm on. I ain't, never gon' stop 
 
Interlude Sonny Digital 
I'm, the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

Aye came in the game. Gettin' money, 
Flippin' chickens, whip, it gettin' money,
