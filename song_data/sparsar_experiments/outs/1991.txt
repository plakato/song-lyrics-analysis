1991 
Hey 
It's the trend setter 
Ridin round New England 
Never been better 
Give. You all a penned letter 
This, my verbal vendetta, 
All you niggas ballin, but you prolly get a pass, never 
First Letter. Last letter, ninth letter last letter RAP, BETTER 
Y'all, stressin. Prolly, got ya, draws. Bunched 
I wish you suckers all could get ya jaw punched 
Glasses of the truth. 
Invite you to drink a tall, one 
Hard to believe they functioning while they on one 
I guess. I fear addiction to the lean of the lean 
I'd rather burn the green. With my team 
M-C with no trouble man, 
The pen, I keep 
S-u-double c -- e- double s. You ven aqui 
Cause, my patience, runnin thin. I'M waiting on the fence 
And shout out to the DJ's who be making records spin 
I'll, give you TwentyOne just to take you through the years. 
It appears. This is old. New flavor in ya ears. 
You should prolly roll another one 
Make it disappear. 
Hell yeah 
I got ta, have it 
Hell yeah 
I got ta, have it 
Hell yeah 
I got ta, have it
