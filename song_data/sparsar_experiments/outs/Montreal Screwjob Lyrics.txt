Montreal Screwjob Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Patience has to plant the seed.
It takes time for it to grow.
There's no question.
I'm gonna make you mad I know.
But you'll never know.
To buy the time that we remember.
Not old mistakes haunt us forever.
So let the wind blow.
Baby you had a good run.
But now you're running out of breath.
Now that stars start to burn out.
They always burn out the rest.
Believe it.
From miles away you'll see the white flag.
Let em know it's on.
It's on.
Now that you know.
Yeah we're still young.
I know you've got some fight in you.
But everything you've come to be is getting old.
It's getting old.
Yeah we're still young.
I know you've got some fight in you.
I'm to tired to sleep this off.
You can't be so scared.
You're holding life.
Yeah we're still young.
I know you've got some fight in you.
But everything you've come to be is getting old.
It's getting old.
But we're still young.
I know you've got some fight in you.
But everything you've come to be.
Is getting old.
And I'm to tired to sleep this off.
