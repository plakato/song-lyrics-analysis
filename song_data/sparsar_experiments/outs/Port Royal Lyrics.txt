Port Royal Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Hundred masts, thirty flags.
An island in the gulf of Darien.
Sandglass, bloody heart.
Flying high above the scene.

Marooners with loaded guns.
Are still waiting at the quay.
A hungry fleet from underworld.
Freedom is the law they pray.

Black Strap, rum and gin.
Sexual freedom all the way.
A rolling dice, an ace of hearts.
One shall win and one's to pay.

Concord and freedom.
No need for the holy writ.
Rebellions, non-servile.
Spitting on religious hypocrites.

Port Royal.
A cry of freedom on the sea.

When the Oxford hits the sea.
Slave driver learns the Moses law.
There is no chance, they can't escape.
They hunt them down and eat 'em raw.

Gin Lane, New Providence.
It all is now since a long time gone.
But there are still descendants.
Port Royal's spirit lives forever on.

Port Royal.
A cry of freedom on the sea.
