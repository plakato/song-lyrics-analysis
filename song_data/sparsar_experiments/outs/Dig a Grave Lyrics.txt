Dig a Grave Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

As I sit here.
Underneath the falling sun.
Wonder when it all is done.
Would it be so bothersome.
If dying is just a part of growing old.
Why live a long life driving alone on a lonely road?

Ohhh time only just ticks away.
While I just sit here thinking about digging a grave.

As I sit here, below clouds of gray.
Often doubt my faith.
It'll rain tomorrow but not today.
So why should I abide by the things I'm told.
I'd rather die than let it show.
What's inside this injured soul.

Ohhh time only just ticks away.
While I just lie here face down in an open grave.
