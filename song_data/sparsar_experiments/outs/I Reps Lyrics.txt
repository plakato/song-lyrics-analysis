William, nigga, 
Yeah, DJ Clue, Desert Storm. You know how we do things: 
Q-u-double-e-, radio, 
And, the question of the day 
Is who and what you rep 
Caller number 1. You on the line, 
 
Ayo its P big, chunky, 40 inch chains, 
I could fuck your woman, but I perfer brains, 
I could duff you out wit guns and bang 
I'ma certified bonofied Mobb Nigga man, 
This ain't, no'87 rap battle: 
This is 2001 bloodsport nigga i'll get At you, 
This is criminal shit, I'm so infamous 
I'm. So gangsta these niggas be nervous. 
When. We pop up ya knees, lock up 
Ya, stomach catch, butterflies, 
And, ya, heart pumps, 
Suppose to be scared, suppose to be'wared 
When. You see me get the fuck out my way. 
Nigga, I'm in here 
And I ain't come for the glamour and glitz 
I came to fuck you up bad, get drunk and find me a bitch 
So where you at girl holla at the kid 
'Fore. I slay one of these lame niggas in here straight up. 
 
Yeah Caller number two 
You on the line. 
 
I got some raps for the streets, 
My niggas pack, the heats 
My soldiers on the corner, crushin up green meat; 
For all the generations and mothers ridin the trains 
To work for y'all crackers for that bullshit pay. 
I reps for my head that cops his weight. 
That take trips uptown just to cop his haze, 
I rep for them chicks, givin brain in the rain. 
That ain't scared to be a freak for the right pay. 
I gots to rep for my familys thats stricten wit, pain, 
For buryin. They boys to soon for this game. 
I rep for my panthers thats, locked away, 
And sittin on deathrow countin down them days; 
I rep for y'all bitches that work lizzie bags, 
That sell hot shit. Half price off of tags, 
I rep for them, chicks that write they own shit. 
That live just like a live to write. They own shit, 
Its 2001 bitch, stop frontin 
I rep for my baby, mamas thats, still walkin 
I rep for them; chicks, collectin, P.A,
