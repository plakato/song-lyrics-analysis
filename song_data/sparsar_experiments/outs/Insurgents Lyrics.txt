Insurgents Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Lady, I don't want to follow.
Drills a needle up my spine.
Go and clean the glass and swallow.
Taking bullets for our valley wives.

Fosters can't feed the pressure.
Hills are unfolding.
Yellow fortune teller.
Yielding tangents that the brail can't hold in.

I wish I could go back in time.

Maybe I don't want to change it.
Love's an open wound.
Just tolerate the mazes.
We're just pilgrams starved for rules.

Nothing's predetermined.
Flies can change this world.
But I'm still determined.
Time, can make us whole.

I wish I could go back in time.

Accelerate our landing time.
Accelerate our love tonight.

I wish I could go back in time.
To where the pavement is kept alive.
