The Way We Behave Lyrics
by The Undead.


1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.
Don't be scared.
By the things that we do.
And don't get mad.
If we do them to you.
We're not looking for a fight.
We're not trying to be brave.
It's just the way we behave.
Don't get violent.
If we step on your feet.
And don't be silent.
If you want to meet us.
We're much more friendly.
Than the newspapers say.
Anyway, it's just the way we behave.
Our bodies are filled.
With such high energy.
We got to jump up and down.
To set it all free.
Our minds work so fast.
It's hard to get the words out.
That's why when we speak.
We usually shout.
So don't get angry.
If we bump into you.
Among our friends.
That's what we usually do.
In other words.
We might be crazy.
But we're not depraved.
Oh no!
It's just the way we behave.
When they let us out of our cage.
It's just the way we behave.
