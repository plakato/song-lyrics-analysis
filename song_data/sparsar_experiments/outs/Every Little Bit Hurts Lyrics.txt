Every Little Bit Hurts Lyrics
by Vivian Green.

Every little bit hurts.
Every little bit hurts...

Every night I cry.
Every night I sigh.
Every night I wonder why.
You treat me cold.
Yet you won't let me go.

Every little hurt counts.
Every little hurt counts.
You say you're coming home.
Yet you never phone.
Leave me all alone.
My love is strong for you.
I'd do wrong for you.
I can't take this loneliness you've given me.
I can't go on giving m life away.

Oh, come back to me.
Darling you'll see.
I can give you all the things you wanted before.
If you will stay with me.

Every little bit hurts.
Every little bit hurts.

To you I'm a toy and you're the boy.
Who has to say when i should play.
Yet you hurt me, desert me.
Why ya hurt me baby?
Why ya hurt me baby?

Oh, come back to me.
Darling you'll see.
I can give you all the things that you wanted before.
If you will stay with me.

Every little bit hurts.
Every little bit hurts.
Every little bit hurts.
Every little bit hurts.
