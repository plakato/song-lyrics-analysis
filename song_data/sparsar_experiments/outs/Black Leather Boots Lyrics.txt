Black Leather Boots Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

Am I loosing you or just loosing myself.
Out in the dark the site of my fate.
Falling walls.
Smashed up bones.
Brother kills brother.
And gold is gold.

Betrayed you.
Like they betrayed me.
They fucked my love and tried to fuck me.
Pearls sink.
In greed and lust.
Flowers die fast.
And I see my people.
Wasted, People tired of being tested.
People die somewhere molested.
Used to feed the rich and nasty.

Black leather boots.
Kickin' peace right in the teeth.
They're killing my baby.

Black leather boots.
Kickin' peace right in the teeth.
They're killing my baby.

Black leather boots.
Kickin' peace right in the teeth.
They're killing my baby.

Black leather boots.
Kickin' peace right in the teeth.

Here's the priest.
Suckin' the boy.
Starting up war.
Blessing the bombs on the top of the world.
Somebody's waiting for you.

He's breathing war.
Smoking up war.
Like fuckin' a whore.
Just playing a role.

He's stealing your child.
Raping your mind.
He's blowing your life to pieces.

All of your stars will be falling down one day.
All of your stars will be falling down some day.
All of your stars will be falling down one day.
All of your stars will be falling down some day.

Some day.
I'll be far away.
One day.
I'll be on my way.
Someday.
I'll be missing you.
One day.
I'll be out there.
For you.
I'll be missing you.
For you.
I'll be out there.

I need your hands in this one.
I need your hands this time.
Against corruption and lies.
Mass destruction and mental slavery.
I need your hands against discriminating nations.
Discriminating people.
Discriminating our right to live in love and peace.

Wasted and I see my people wasted.
People tired of being tested.
People die somewhere molested.
I need your hands this time.
I need you....

People wasted.
People tired of being tested.
People die somewhere molested.
Used to feed the rich and nasty.

Black leather boots.
Kickin' peace right in the teeth.
They're killing my baby.
