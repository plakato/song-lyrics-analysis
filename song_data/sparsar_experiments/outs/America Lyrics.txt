America Lyrics
by Ry.

When I touch mics I split lives in two.
How I'm nicer than you but still more trifer than you?
With the pureness of the Virgin Mary.
But my burden scary.
Except most rap fans have heard me rarely.
If they said I'm wack then they lying like the perj of Barry.

And happily body rappers like a mother's first to carry.
So basically you can say I'm worse than scary.
Plus I'm valuable just like good leather.
I pull out my woody, your girl just became a woodpecker.
Plus I'm like the hood's Jekyll &amp; Hyde.
I got you rather surprised behind these freckles of pride.
And rappers round me passing out like out of bounds calls.
While I'm dropping shit and piss on them like I'm round stalls.

I flip my longest finger cause it's profitable.
For these profit flows, double meaning I'm the messenger I bring prophet.
flows.
So like Grants inside of your jeans, bitch your profits closed.
Cause you took an L to this prosperous soul.
Who like a big ass bodyguard came to conquer the dough.
And rap fans are like woah, I mean Ry is kinda sleek bravo.
When I drop bodies like Cheick Kongo.
Yea I mean then I'm shaving your head off.
Ry so sick that he be making the dead cough.
It's evident that I helm a sick flow.
When it come to bars they say he brew without the big nose.
I'm a technical rapper of exceptional strata.
Who felt it and captured.
When Ry round niggas know to put they mics down.
Cause they punchlines and bars be like a dry round.
No blood no effect, no hugs no respect.
, no slugs no sweat, no thugs no flesh.
No drugs no tech, no rugs nor baguettes.
For these young rejects.
I flow they be feetless.
Plus the fact that Ry host beef like Seacrest.
Simon Cowell, I can rhyme a vowel.
That makes no sense like an Alzheimer's child.
Hi Ms. Chow, Ry's time is now.
