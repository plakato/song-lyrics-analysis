Joy Lyrics
by VNV Nation.

Have I no control, is my soul not mine?
Am I not just man, destiny defined?
Never to be ruled nor held to heel.
Not heaven or hell, just the land between.

Am I not man, does my heart not bleed?
No lord, no God, no hate.
No pity, no pain, just me.
Comprehend and countermand.
Synchronous guidance, I choose my way.
Never to be ruled nor held to heel.
No heaven or hell, just the land between.
And am I not man?

So why do I love when I still feel pain?
When does it end, when is my work done?
Why am I lone and why do I feel that.
I carry a sword through a battlefield?
So why do I love when I still feel pain?
When does it end, when is my work done?
Why do I fight and why do I feel that.
I carry a sword, that I carry a sword?

Like the path to heaven or the road to hell.
Our choice is our own, consequences bind.
We are the kings of wisdom, the fools as well.
We are the gods to many, we are humble men.
We who build great works just to break them down.
We who make our rules so we never fail.

So why do I love when I still feel pain?
When does it end, when is my work done?
Why am I lone and why do I feel that.
I carry a sword through a battlefield?
So why do I love when I still feel pain?
When does it end, when is my work done?
Why do I fight and why do I feel that I carry a sword.
That I carry a sword through a battlefield?
