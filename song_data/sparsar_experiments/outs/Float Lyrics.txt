Float Lyrics
by Switchfoot.


OK, let's do it.

Turn it up so I can feel it.
Turn it up so I can be near it.
Baby says she's got that feeling.
Moonwalking on the ceiling.

Refrain.
It's alright.
It's alright.
It's alright.
It's alright, all alright.

Turn it up so I can feel it.
Loud enough so I can get near it.
Baby's in that slower motion.
Moonwalking on the ocean.

It's how we float, yeah.
Feet ain't even touching ground.
It's how we float, yeah.
Flying at the speed of sound.
I'm in orbit like a jet pilot.
Ain't no gravity to try to fight it.
It's how we float, yeah.
We ain't never coming down.

Don't you need someone to lean on?
Don't you need that taste of freedom?
It don't take no education.
All you need's an invitation.

Refrain.
It's alright.
It's alright, all alright.

It's how we float, yeah.
Feet ain't even touching ground.
It's how we float, yeah.
Flying at the speed of sound.
I'm in orbit like a jet pilot.
Ain't no gravity to try to fight it.
It's how we float, yeah.
We ain't never coming down.

Away from the crowds where you realize.
The herd's insecure or the free mind.
So don't let em tell you what to feel like.
They can't bring me down, can't bring me down, yeah.
Money gonna run away hardest.
Money gonna leave you broken-hearted.
But money can't finish what we started.
It can't bring me down, can't bring me down, yeah.

It's how we float, yeah.
Feet ain't even touching ground.
It's how we float , yeah.
Flying at the speed of sound.
I'm in orbit like a jet pilot.
Ain't no gravity to try to fight it.
It's how we float, yeah.
We ain't never coming down.

It's how we float, yeah.
Feet ain't even touching ground.
It's how we float, yeah.
Flying at the speed of sound.
I'm in orbit like a jet pilot.
Ain't no gravity to try to fight it.
It's how we float, yeah.
We ain't never coming down.
