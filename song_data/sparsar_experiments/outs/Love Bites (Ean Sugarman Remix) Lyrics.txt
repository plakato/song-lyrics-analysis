Love Bites (Ean Sugarman Remix) Lyrics
by QED.

Come on 
When you make love. Do you look in the mirror? 
Who? Do you think of? Does he look like me 
Do, you tell lies and say that it's forever 
Do, you think twice or just touch'n', see ooh yeah 
I. Don'T wan na touch you too much baby
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So. I don't wan na be there when you decide to break it
Love, bites love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's, no surprise
Love begs love pleads
It's what I need
It's, what I need
When, I'm with you! Are you somewhere else 
Am I gettin' through or do you please yourself, 
When you wake up. Will you walk out? 
It can't be love. If you throw it about ooh c'mon
I, don't wan na touch you too much baby
Cause. Making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So. I don't wan na, be there when you decide to break it
Love, bites love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's, no surprise
Love begs love pleads
It's. What I need
Love bites
