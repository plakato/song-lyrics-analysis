Can'tcha Say (You Believe In Me) Lyrics
by Boston.


Can't you say you believe in me?
Can't you see what you mean to me?

Everyday I think of you.
You're on my mind.
Some things in the past.
Are better left behind.
Every night I dream of you.
The images as clear as day.

Can't you say you believe in me?
Can't you say you believe in me?
You know that where there's a will there's a way.
Can't you say you believe in me?
Can't you see what it means to me?
Don't leave me alone tonight.
Because I still love you.

We've had our time apart.
And I knew right from the start.
I could never change.
The way I feel about you baby.
We can sit here all night long.
And separate the right from the wrong.
But love won't wait.

Ooohh, still in love with you.
You know I need you baby, to stand by me.
Can't you see I need you, baby.
Oooh, I'm still in love with you.

I love you.
