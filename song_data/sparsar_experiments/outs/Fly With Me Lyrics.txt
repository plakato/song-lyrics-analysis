Fly With Me Lyrics
by 3pac.

Yeah 
Come fly with me, come fly with me. 
Anywhere you wan na go is where we can be 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me, 
And, take it to the top girl. Don'T you see, 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me. 
Anywhere you wan na. Go is where we can be 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me, 
And! Take it to the top girl. Don'T you see, 
 
I can take you anywhere. You wan na go girl, 
Hit the beach chillin' with the flossy pearls girl, 
Go outside and scope out. The squirrels girl 
We can have the best time that we ever had 
 
Yeah. We don't even have to have sex 
We, can hold hands and have a good time. 
We can just talk. We can be friends 
But at the the end of the night might want to have sex 
Cause. I think you're hot and I have
a big wiener 
And, I'm going to put my wiener inside of your vagina 
And. It'S gon na all make sense. 
 
Come fly with me, come fly with me. 
Anywhere you wan na go is where we can be 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me, 
And, take it to the top girl. Don'T you see, 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me. 
Anywhere you wan na. Go is where we can be 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me, 
And, take it to the top girl. Don'T you see 
 
Yeah girl, 
You know, I know. What'S good 
You know, I'm the only white nigga in the neighborhood 
I get the chedda. I get the bread 
I, get it poppin', I'm dodgin', red
and blue 
Talkin'' bout, the po', that's a po' 4-way zone, flowin' off the dome 
Baby know, I'm known from the bottom-to-the-top 
Son. I rose up 
If, you can't talk, shit haters and they froze up 
They. See me now and they like'damn 
Why, can't I be like the the white nigga ?' 
Gettin' checks when he is asleep 
then. You know I'm gon na get it Your girl. Let me beat the cheeks 
 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me. 
Anywhere you wan na go is where we can be 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me, 
And, take it to the top girl. Don'T you see, 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me. 
Anywhere you wan na go is where we can be 
Come fly with me. Come fly with me, 
And! Take it to the top girl. Don'T you see?
