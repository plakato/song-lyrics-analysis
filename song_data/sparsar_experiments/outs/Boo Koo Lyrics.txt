Boo Koo Lyrics
by Yung Joc.


Welcome to Mr. Robinsons neighborhood.
You know what it is.
It ain't no different form anyone elses hood.
You come through here you gonna see boo koo shit.
Playboy, talk to em.

Anything that you got a lot of.
Anything over 1000 dollars.
Over 50 goons when you squad up.
30 inches on your impala.

Yo, I got boo koo flavor.
I got boo koo gators.
I got boo koo paper so you know it's boo koo haters.
I got boo koo chips.
I got boo koo dip.
I got boo koo clips so it's boo koo hollow tips.
I blow boo koo dough.

I blow boo koo smoke.
So I boo koo choke.
Boo koo trap niggas.
Boo koo rap niggas.
Boo koo cap pealas.
Yeah, that's boo koo claps nigga.

Yup, I get boo koo brains.
Boo koo miles per hour.
I switch boo koo lanes.
Bookoo folks love me.
So I get boo koo thanks.

Anything that you got a lot of.
Anything over 1000 dollars.
Over 50 goons when you squad up.
30 inches on your impala.

I got boo koo yoda.
I need boo koo soda.
I got boo koo pots.
I need boo koo rollers.
I got boo koo freaks.
Serve them boo koo meat.
Hear me from up the street.
Yeah, I got boo koo beats.
Check my sneaks.
I rock boo koo ones.
Check my receipt.

I wanna fuck Lil Debbie.
Cuz she got boo koo cream.
Boo koo pipes.
Boo koo ice.

Anything that you got a lot of.
Anything over 1000 dollars.
Over 50 goons when you squad up.
30 inches on your impala.

Don't try me dog.
You'll have boo koo stitches.
Check my hairline.

Lights, camera, action, we make boo koo movies.

Don't know how to act.
But we do boo koo stunts.
We got boo koo sacks so we need boo koo blunts.
I got boo koo grams.

By now you know what boo koo is I said boo koo boo koo times.

Anything that you got a lot of.
Anything over 1000 dollars.
Over 50 goons when you squad up.
30 inches on your impala.

Anything that you got a lot of.
Anything over 1000 dollars.
Over 50 goons when you squad up.
30 inches on your impala.
