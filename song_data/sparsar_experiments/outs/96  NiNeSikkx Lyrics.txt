Now, I wan na know who's in the motherfucking house, 
Is Queens in tha house 
 
Roll up da philly, we getting silly 
In graffitti lofts chilling on chilli rocks just really 
Only young knocks out on the look out for cops 
In. These spots, We watch talk, drop 
Lots of conscious lyrically, accomplish 
\-, Complicated interlectual content, 
Share ya company from Z to compton 
Stop. The narrative. This is native to y'all 
Scene, a big party which bitches Q and lamar 
Styro-cup, don't give a fuck about your „I-know stuff“ 
Eye-go-not. So, ironically, inside your psych-oh-Uhhm.- 
I, don't know why I do smoke so much. Take a toke is lust. 
But tonight I'm getting high like I am so in-luck 
Yea I'll toke a lot crack a morgan open like coconut 
Roll-, a blunt and get so in-touch with Emily 
Your best friend may be your enemy. Who's got stuff. 
\- Put it up baby push it up. You sitting weird though 
I'm in the truck she gim me fuck, I'm speaking weird though 
„What a weirdo he's like so for-real gross“, 
But reckoning that you subbed to me shows you got an ear for me, though. 
For me, these egos and machos are very muchos 
Not. My secundos they're unos, who don't know my Judo 
Muchas Gracias. I learned that shit on Sesame 
Don't know what the fuck is up with me. I act so recklessly. 
First crashed my car in a tree and now I killed Stephany 
She was another girl who, once ago, had slept with me. 
\- Just saw a cow shoot down the deputy 
What, the fuck is up where's the party and where is Stephany 
I, think I'm credibly. So incredibly high right now, 
I believe I can fly right now. 
I'M in the sky zone high zone lost in the mist above me – 
This for my NY peeps living like Big Lebowski
