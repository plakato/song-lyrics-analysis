Happiness Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

February skies.
You cause the resurrection of my butterflies.
We got dressed up in disguise.
And I tried my best but I just can't recognize you.

Well, you, you've got no excuse.
Is this making you happy?
Is this making you happy?
Cause it's true, you're all I have to lose.
So if it's making you happy.
Then it's making me happy too.

Go do what you like.
Cause you always find a way to be satisfied.
But when all that glory dies.
You can find my trapped behind your tired eyes.

Yeah, you, you've got no excuse.
This is making you happy.
This is making you happy.
And it's true, you're all I have to lose.
So if it's making you happy.
It must be making me happy too.

Well, I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I don't know who you are.
Well, I don't know who you are.
Yeah, I don't know who you are, oh no.

Well, I don't care who you are.
Wanna fall in love, wanna fall apart.
Yeah don't care who you are.
Wanna fall in love, wanna fall apart.

Well, I don't care who we are.
Wanna fall in love till we fall apart.
Yeah I don't care who we are.
Wanna fall in love till we fall apart.
