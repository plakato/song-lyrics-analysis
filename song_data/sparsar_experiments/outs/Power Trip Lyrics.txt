Power Trip Lyrics
by Unique.


Okay back when i was looking for some time to spend.
You wandered into my life but only as a friend.
Cause you ex man was fam pretty much a brother to me.
Bitches in my ear always trying to say something to me.
You was always in my ear saying they to slutty for me.
Matter fact looking back you didn't like any girl i fucked with.
But guarantee that wet pussy was clouding my judgement.
I'm single you love me i;m taking you say fuck it.
Now I wonder if we'll be together somewhere down the line Hol up.
You gotta new man that's fine but he better treat you right or fuck i'ma ride.
And I hope you know i'd right 100 songs for you.
Staying up all night trying to think would i do wrong to you?
Never in my life please give me a call if i'm on your mind your always on mine.
Foreal.

You were probably the only thing that i'd commit to.
I chose conscious over arrogant but now your on a power trip to.
You packed up your bags i miss the old days when you were real.
Selfless, you gave back, and the only thing you packed was a dub-sack.
And when trial &amp; tribulation came you knew we'd get through it together.
Knew it would always get better.
So fall back in my arms you know ill make you feel comfortable again.
Through thick and through thin for rich or for poor.
And all that jealousy honestly makes me love you more.
Cause i never had you had you.
Only in my dreams is when i have you.
So fall through like i fell for you.
Don't be nervous i know you feel it to.
Now be bad to me while i feel on you.
I won't fuck and leave you know im real with you.
I'm saying.
