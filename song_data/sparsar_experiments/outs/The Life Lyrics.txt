The Life Lyrics
by Sweetness.


Where I am and where I wanna be.
This is something in between.
The young James Dean.
Rolling like a movie when I pull up to the scene.
The Sweet Life that's always been the theme.
The Land of Opportunity, what's the scheme.
Open the car door to a life that feels like fate.
Waiting for reality to settle in.
As I settle into some real estate.

Talking high rise.
The view from the bedside.
Where dreams reside.
Like 151 First Side.
With the crew inside.
Grandview Avenue for my grand view plans.
The blueprint on the rise in my very own hands.
Now watch me build it.
No old money, just young, affluent, and brilliant.
Putting up the capital for all my interests.
Doing what I love, that's the business.
And the contract is like early mornings and later nights.
Ignoring warnings and catching flights.
Dressing up and wearing Nikes.
Fine dining like gold forks.
Leaving a trail of old corks.
Elevator to the Top Floors.
Catching the helicopter tours.
Looking down, better believe the world is yours.
Yeah, the world is yours.
Like Jordan Belfort, I open the doors.
My fortune 500 is my own virtue.
Get the money fast and make it last.
With a girl, no one time thing, I got the annual pass.
Just living while I'm young and no looking back.
This is the life, doesn't matter what's next.
Because when the sun goes down and comes back up.
I'll still remain the best.
