Americans (feat. Jacoby Shaddix) Lyrics
by X-Clan.

Yeah!!!

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

Im afraid of america.

Terrorism measurements.
Rise in the streets.

We're like the predators, prey in the jungle concrete.

Shepard the sheep.
In the belly of the beast whose appetite is greed.
Men women and children.
Building and countries.
Endless degree.
Endless the need.
For world domination.
The horsemen reconvene.
In the Twilight zone.
It's heavier then heavy.
Columbine shooting.
Sabotage on the levy.
Can't even be safe in your own territory.
Broad daylight fools going Kamikaze.
Jesus and Isis.
Horus and Mary.
American religion is jinxed like Halle Berry.
Can't find the truth in the local library.
This patriotic livin' is madness.

Yeah!!

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

Im afraid of america.

Celebrate holidays.
Don't konw my own.
Pledge allegiance to a flag.
Don't know my home.
Dislacement from slave ships.
Distrubed the tone.
Im a man of peace living int he danger zone.
Gottta watch my back gotta watch my front.
Every culture wanna fight.
But what the hell we want?
What do we have to stand the gain.
Lettin' the violent strain.
Trickle downto the youth.
At the gate restrained.
In the juvenile halls.
Wrong side of the game.
Ain't nobody but the parents that could take the blame.
If youre unsupservised you create your own way.
Certain things by survival in your school day.
The american way.
Decrorated vets going out down on the boulevard.
On crack cocaine.
The american way.
Dedicated people who life to defend the heat on in the end.

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

Im afraid of america.

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

I'm afraid of America.

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

I'm afraid of america.
I'm afraid for the world.
I'm afraid I can't help it.
I'm afraid I can't.

I'm afraid of America.
