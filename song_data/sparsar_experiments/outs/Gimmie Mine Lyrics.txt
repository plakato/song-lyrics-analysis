Gimmie Mine Lyrics
by Bad Lucc.


Bad Lucc.
I need mine.
The green packs are better , BX yeah that.
BL , Mr. Lucc , 354 , DL.
Mmm! i'mma G , See 'em like don't push 'em i need that.
Ay ay put the kush in , i need that steering.
I need that McLaren for what you're wearing.
Piggy.

I see you my nigga i need that cannon for the boosters.
Who tryna do us , don't do it.
I need me a reason to turn a nigga into a circle.
My blood hands'll hurt you.
Niggas that wanna be that i murk you , it's murda.
Turn fist fights to funerals , services'll merge ya.
Pigg.

Fuck it i'm on my candle shit.
Light up the room i need the keys and the hammers bitch.
Need me a pack and the ? roll up a candle stick.
I get high and start putting my hands on shit.
Please , i need G's.
Rule nigga fuckin' for cheese , i need ease.
High outta my mind pisses the palm trees.
Word to my nigga Skeme , i need mine, the C.R.E.A.M.

The hard top , bad bitches.
Bags of money , ? your shit , i need cents's.
I need mines , got ASAP , capische.
Long as money spinning weed , yeah man.
