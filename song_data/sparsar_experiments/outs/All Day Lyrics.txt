All Day Lyrics

Done pleasing this shit.
Home sick for a place that dun even exist.
Straight needing a spliff.
But all day I've sharpened saw blades.
And polished large chains to carve this bar's way.
The liquor and herb gots me cross ways.
Hardly I'll say, I'm in good hands; AllState.
Pause, wait!
Wasted eight hours at the mall, Great.
I'm caught between a rock n a hard place.
I'm not at all what you prolly would think.
Talk to the cops and you got a marked grave.
Sorry for the wait but I'm back with a vengeance.
For the cash and big wishes.
Blasting gats with some big clips.
You faggots admitted.
I've practically been sent.
To practice life with this.
Knack for tight rhythm.
To show a packed coliseum.
Its FidyPix a beast with sway.
Been spitting slick since Jesus grave.
Always carpe diem, seize the day.
I'll be done with it all when the sea's cease waves.
Its FidyPix, needless said.
You won't find me without at least a gram.
Stomping the yard; the heart of the cards!
All day all day we balling so hard!
