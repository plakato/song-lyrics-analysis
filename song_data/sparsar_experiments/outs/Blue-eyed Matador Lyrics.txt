Blue-eyed Matador Lyrics
by Voltaire.

Here, on the slab I awake.
And I'm freezing.
There is a light up ahead.
And I rise and float through the air.
Through a tunnel.
Now the light's up ahead.

Here, in a bullring I stand.
Am I dreaming?
There is a bull up ahead.
And I laugh, 'Ha ha ha'.
I get it, I'm dead.
And this whole charade's.
A fight for my soul.
Red-eyed fiend.
Lunges I turn while.
Skeletal picadores.
Stab away at the beast.

I lay, I lay, I lay, I lay.
I lay my eyes on the Devil.
Oh fate, once again I lay.
I lay, I lay, I lay.

There in the stands something grabs.
My attention.
Like it is calling to me.
It's a girl with eyes like the sea.
Is she an angel sent to watch over me?

I lay, I lay, I lay, I lay.
I lay my eyes on the Devil.
Oh fate, once again I lay.
I lay, I lay, I lay.

Suddenly I remember.
The girl with eyes like the sea.
I turn, she winks and she smiles gently.
While the bull runs straight into me.

I lay, I lay, I lay, I lay.
I lay my eyes on the Devil.
'Blue-eyed matador', I cried.
I fell for your wicked disguise.
