I Am the Man Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


Everybody held their breath the moment you walked through that door.
Everybody thought that I would crumble when you said hello.
But I know something that they don't know.
I've learned the art of not letting the heartache show.

I am the man.
Who learned how to lie.
Made everyone think that I'm alright.
I am the man.
Who managed to smile.
Foolin' the world for a little while.
Seein' her tonight starts this hurtin' inside.
I guarantee that she'll never know.
Cause I am the man.
Who learned how to lie.

I walk across the room to show the two of them how cool I am.
Tryin' not to stare at the ring that's there on her left hand.
I see the light of his love in her eyes.
God I practiced this moment a million times.

Someday.
I won't be a liar.
I'll let my heart feel the fire.
Of falling in love again.
But until then.

I am the man.
Who learned how to lie.
