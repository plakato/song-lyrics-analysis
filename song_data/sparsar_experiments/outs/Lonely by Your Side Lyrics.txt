Lonely by Your Side Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

I'm counting my lives.
Feeling the strain.
To get right with you.
Can't be this hard to do.

No saving this day.
My chance slips away.
These words overdue.
Won't stop me from losing you.

And it's lonely, lonely, lonely by your side.
And I've nowhere, nowhere left to hide.
And it's lonely, lonely, lonely by your side.
And I've nowhere, nowhere left to hide.

No time on our side.
Can't open my eyes.
It hurts me to see.
You long for some purity.

Through all of the years.
A slave to the tears.
Another reason to cry.
The last time for you and I.

And it's lonely, lonely, lonely by your side.
And I've nowhere, nowhere left to hide.
And it's lonely, lonely, lonely by your side.
And I've nowhere, nowhere left to hide.

Lonely, lonely, lonely by your side.
Nowhere, nowhere left to hide.

I'm counting my lives.
Feeling the strain.
To get right with you.
Can't be this hard to do.

And it's lonely, lonely, lonely by your side.
And I've nowhere, nowhere left to hide.
