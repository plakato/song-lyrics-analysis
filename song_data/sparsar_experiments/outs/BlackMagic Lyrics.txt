BlackMagic Lyrics
by Ziyaad Luceo.


That Voodoo that you do.
Fucked with my point of view.
And you know.
Your love is black magic.
Every outcome is tragic.
Even though we're nostalgic.
Your love crimes are graphic.

Ziyaad Luce≈ç &amp; Aaliyah Allah x2.
That Voodoo that you do.
Your Voodoo is.
That Voodoo that you do yeah.
Your Voodoo is crucial.
