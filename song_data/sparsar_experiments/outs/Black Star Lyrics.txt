Black Star Lyrics
by Queen of Hearts.

Coco nights control me.
Revolve me.
I like the way it goes.
Open up my window.
Escape into the shadow.

Tear away my soul and make me feel whole.
Feeling so cold.
Haunt my sleep and dreams with vivid extremes.
Let us dissolve.
Fill my head with your thoughts.
Ready for the onslaught.
Tangled in your skin.
Desolate and hopeful.
This is where it all begins.

You can be my black star.
In the night we flicker.
Twisting and turning.
We float in devotion.
Now we're going too far.
Caught in the motion.
Love me like you hate me.
Hate me like you love me.
Do as you please.
Fill me up leave me empty.
Wish for my black star.

Innocent but deadly.
You move me.
Pull my body close.
Gaze into the night air.
I search but no one's out there.

Burn a sacred scare deep into my heart.
Break apart.
Fill my every need.
Absorbing my greed.
Light after dark.

Fill my head with your thoughts.
Ready for the onslaught.
Tangled in your skin.
Desolate and hopeful.
This is where it all begins.

You can be my black star.
In the night we flicker.
Twisting and turning.
We float in devotion.
Now we're going too far.
Caught in the motion.
Love me like you hate me.
Hate me like you love me.
Do as you please.
Fill me up leave me empty.
Wish for my black star.

You can be my black star.
In the night we flicker.
Twisting and turning.
We float in devotion.
Now we're going too far.
Caught in the motion.
Love me like you hate me.
Hate me like you love me.
Do as you please.
Fill me up leave me empty.
Wish for my black star.
