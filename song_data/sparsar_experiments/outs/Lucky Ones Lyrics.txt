Lucky Ones Lyrics
by Union J.

This one is for all the dreamers.
The freak shows and all the divas.
Bring on the inbetweeners.
Stand up and come out from the dark.
We know who we are.
Yeah we're the lucky ones.
This one is for all the zeros.
The misfits you're my heroes.
Put down my alter ego.
Okay we're broken and we're scared.
Now we're happy as we are.
Yeah we're the lucky ones.
Cause we got the love and we got the heart.
We're all the above and it's from the start.
We're here till the end.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
La la la la la la la la.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
La la la la la la la la.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
Young hearts beneath your old skin.
I see your eyes still sparkling.
You know that you're not done yet.
So let's go but just for one last time.
Come with us tonight.
Cause we're the lucky ones.
Cause we got the love and we got the heart.
We're all the above and it's from the start.
We're here till the end.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
La la la la la la la la.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
La la la la la la la la.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
Let me out out of this cage.
And jump right off off of this stage.
I'm a shooting star.
I'm a shock wave.
We're a work of art.
Look what we've made.
Let me out out of this cage.
And jump right off off of this stage.
I'm a shooting star.
I'm a shock wave.
We're a work of art.
Look what we've made.
La la la la la la la la.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
La la la la la la la la.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
Cause we got the love and we got the heart.
We're all the above and it's from the start.
We're here till the end.
We are who we are.
We're the lucky ones.
