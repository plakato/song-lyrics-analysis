Beefing Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

Huh 
Ha 
Yea 
 
Let me tell you a little story about ... 
About this nigga. I knew ... 
This nigga. I knew ... 
Jus-Just ... 
 
Look 
 
You was my nigga. Now we beefin' 
Im bustin' at you, 
You bustin' at me, 
And. It won't stop till. We both sleepin' 
 
We, was claimin' the same hood 
Fucked the same bitches 
And. They knew 
If, I hit it. You had to hit it too. 
We was crew. 
You was with me when I first pulled the trigger 
You tried to shoot too, but your gun jammed. 
So we pulled off..ya, remember 
I hid by your mama house for a couple of days: 
Cause the niggas we was beefin' with knew where I stayed. 
We were some down south niggas 
Bootin''em out niggas 
The, wrong route, niggas ..., 
Typical, niggas 
We, just nickel and dime. It 
Sellin' weed ... to the needy, 
Everything be 50-50 
Ain't, no need for being greedy 
You, my dogg huh 
So thats, how we played it, 
Niggas who hated ..., 
We, rushin' them and demonstrated 
While. We ain't to be faded, 
On this mission to get money, power and bitches 
Or, whatever come along with these riches 
That's. If nobody snitches 
I'd, do a BID for ya 
Take care of your KID for ya, 
But, damn 
Look what these pussy niggas done did to ya. 
 
phone rings 
 
-Hello, 
-Yeah, nigga, whats, happenin', 
-Whats happenin', with ya dogg 
-Nigga, whats happenin' with you nigga 
Talking about you got some beef with me: nigga 
-Beef wit', you Nigga, you know I'm a real nigga 
If. I had some beef with you. 
I'D, come to you like a man, dogg .... It ain't like that between us 
See. What it is is ... 
You talkin' to these niggas ..., and these niggas got you goin' 
 
Them niggas told you. I blew up 
And. I forgot about us 
The same niggas, who was with you and afraid to bust 
How. Could you listen to these niggas 
When? They mean no good 
Mothafuckers ain't. Even from our hood 
And know you snortin' furl, with'em 
Off in that world, with'em 
And Father, forgive him! 
He dance to some other rhythm 
Ever thought that we could work it out. 
We would meet 
But as long as you with them. Niggas 
I'll, be with that heat, 
And thats, deep 
Cause. I made a promise to your mama when we was only 12 
I'll, deliver you from evil and keep you alive and well 
Guess. I got ta disappoint her 
But. You leave me no choice: ... 
Callin', my crib, with this murder-murder tone in your voice, 
What ..., I'm a bitch or somethin' 
I used to fight for ya 
Used to let you stay at my mama crib 
When shit. Jsut wasn't right for ya 
Look. What you do me in return, ... 
I, guess I played with fire 
So. Eventually it burns 
Nigga, 
, 
-Hello, Hello, 
Man. This nigga done fuckin' hung up on me. 
Y'All think that nigga serious 
 
It's world war, nigga
