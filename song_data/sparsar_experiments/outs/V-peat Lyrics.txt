V-peat Lyrics
by Visionaries.

Its nothing you've ever seen before.
It something you see everyday in a L.A.
That first collection, mirror reflection, crowd connection, redebrection never.
energy.
Livin up to the name, never give up in the game, everythings changed, but.
remains the same.
Share the joy in the pain blood in my veins.
Unconditional love is shown, messages passed through the microphone, to those.
who know, keeps spreadin my words, make the conscience choice we can't do it.
alone.
Search the world over, and yet you were right, over my shoulder, all we need.
to connect is solar, lunar activity room tum.
World tune up, they all with the show another eptical, they cleptic sold out.
he hit a deceptic cause in a flash, its gone and were back to the studio to.
write another song each page will get us to the next day in age one love, with.
whatever comes up with trust two, they fill us to the crown with that sound.
and at the.
Let the games begin.

This is warfare.

Notorious visions.
Wonder, under, thunder, and fog.
Visions from under, the under dog.
My fans dress better than me im happy to be a man and its better to be.
The next NWA my name is 2mex im the man that socked andrew w.k.
Crash the party with smaller words.
Smash like armies of ?????
