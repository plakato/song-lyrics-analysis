Ben Hur - The Legend Of Chin Album Version Lyrics
by Switchfoot.

Everything I know tell me she's everything.
That I could hope for.
Everything I know tell me I can't let her.
Walk away.
I took my time to find the words.
I hoped she'd feel the same.
Cause I want someone to share my smile.
To share the pain, to be there when the sea turns gray.
To share the joy for better or worse.
And I thought that it might have been her.
Wonder if she knows.
The way I saw her soul light up my life.
Wonder if she knows.
Of the pain I feel tonight.
I took my time to find the words.
I hoped she'd feel the same.
Cause I want someone to share my smile.
To share the pain, to be there when the sea turns gray.
To share the joy for better or worse.
And I thought that it might have been her.
And I thought that it might have been her.
And I thought that it might have been her.
And I thought that it might have been her.
And I thought that it might have been.
I thought that it might have been.
I thought that it might have been her.
