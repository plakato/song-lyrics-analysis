Paradise Lyrics
by XOV.


Your silhouette in the far everywhere that I go.
You disappear in the dark, you're like my shadow.

Refrain.
And I can feel your presence in the air.

Sometimes I swear I can hear you clear.

Smile through life - smile, smile, smile.

I say, I say, oh.
My my my, we can meet in paradise.
Each time we close our eyes, ah.
I say, I say, oh.
My my my, we can meet in paradise.
Each time we close our eyes, ah.
I say, I say, oh.

The memories of our past, they give me power.
I will live, I will laugh, I'll make you prouder.

Refrain.
And I can feel your presence in the air.

Sometimes I swear I can hear you clear.

Smile through life - smile, smile, smile.

I say, I say, oh.
My my my, we can meet in paradise.
Each time we close our eyes, ah.
I say, I say, oh.
My my my, we can meet in paradise.
Each time we close our eyes, ah.
I say, I say, oh.

Interlude.
Tell me if you're there.
Sometimes , tell me.
Tell me if you're there.
Sometimes , tell me.
Tell me if you're there.
Sometimes , tell me.
Tell me if you're there.
Tell me if you're there.

Breakdown.
My my my, we can meet in paradise.
Each time we close our eyes, ah.
I say, I say, oh.
My my my, we can meet in paradise.
Each time we close our eyes, ah.
I say, I say, oh.

Tell me if you're there.
Sometimes , tell me.
Tell me if you're there.
Sometimes , tell me.
Tell me if you're there.
Sometimes , tell me.
Tell me if you're there.
Tell me if you're there.
