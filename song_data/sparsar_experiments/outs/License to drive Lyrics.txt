License to drive Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

I've got a license to drive.
Just teenage excuses and crystalline lies.
I've got a reason to try.
Cause when we expire, we can't get much higher.

Mercedes Lane, the curls I can't avoid.
The pink dress looks better on the Caddy floor.
Save a sip for me, it's my night to dream.
Do you want me? want me?

I've got a license to drive.
Just teenage excuses and crystalline lies.
I've got a reason to try.
Cause when we expire, we can't get much higher.

The engines dead, the trunk becomes her bed.
Let's fix the dents and take the while again.
Archie's glow, the last I'll ever know.
Less is more, Les is more.

I've got a license to drive.
Just teenage excuses and crystalline lies.
I've got a reason to try.
Cause when we expire, we can't get much higher.

Didn't even fail, didn't even fail.

Didn't even fail, didn't even fail.
The White Golf, the girl, it's all too real.

I've got a license to drive.
Just teenage excuses and crystalline lies.
I've got a reason to try.
Cause when we expire, we can't get much higher.
