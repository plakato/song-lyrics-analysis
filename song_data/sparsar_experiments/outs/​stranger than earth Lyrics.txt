â€‹stranger than earth Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


I had a feeling you broke and the smoke filled you up
I wasn't thinkin''bout you
You have a mind that makes sight of the weight you pick. Up
I wasn't thinkin''bout you

Again. Again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't
Again again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't

There is a color that shines through your skin
Like. The moon on the wind, when I dare bear you in
The night is full on behalf of your evaded. Mask
And, the rings'round. Your eyes

We are stranger than earth with the seasons misled
Stronger than her moods
When, our parts parted. She bled and bled and bled
I wasn't thinkin''bout you

Again. Again again. I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't
Again again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't

There is no lesson in magic
There were untimely dreams
Where I knew
Woken in a fog, don't sweat, it
And reckon none of it
Had come from. You
There is no lesson in magic
There were untimely dreams
Where I knew
Woken in a fog, don't sweat, it
And reckon none of it
Had come from you

Refrain
Pity. Seek what we might lose
But in a week? Might our weakness? Elude

There was a stagger that shifted. My hips

There was a danger that seeped from my skull
How it dripped on us all, but it wasn't. Your fault

We are stranger than earth with the seasons misled
Stronger than her moods
When. Our parts parted she bled and bled and bled
I wasn't thinkin''bout you

Again. Again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't
Again again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't
Again again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't
Again again again, I wasn't thinkin''bout you
I. Wasn'T I wasn't

Breakdown
And? We break downstairs with our fevers in the air
I forgot to ask how I lonely left them. There
How thick, it sits and why your eyes glare
How thick it sits and why your eyes glare

Refrain
Pity seek what we might lose
But in a week. Might our weakness? Elude
