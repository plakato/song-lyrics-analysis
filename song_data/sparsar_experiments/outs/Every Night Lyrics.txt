Every Night Lyrics
by Wordplay.

I'M super high high up in the sky with them. Birdies fool, 
My, crazy life, I'm bickin' back being bool 
Imma, conscious, rapper, welcome to my school school 
This volume, 4, 1, 2 and 3 was cool, but this got mo' 
Y'all, try and hate, but I got an addicting flow 
And when y'all spit y'all only so-so, so 
No def cause in my sleep I think abstract, like I'm Perlovsky 
Google that then come back for something deep 
You back Cause umm. I was thinking bruh 
Why y'all underestimate me, but don't give me a chance 
And when I show y'all up y'all, just so quick to change. 
Please get the fuck up out my face. My face 
No A-B-C-D-E-F, but I'm a G 
I'm, the best even Ray Charles, can see 
School first rap second track number three 
I'm running hella fast you'd think I got ta pee 
The limit of my success is y = x, 
I'm killing every track. That means I lay these bars to rest 
On, my to the top no GPS 
Cause. I don't need no hell from you rotten pests. 
Don'T critique me if you never heard Word Play 
Running for president vote for Word, Play 
Shout out to Dom cause. He got the word play 
After, I graduate I'll be in Cali. 
Without me, your home is just a ho, get it 
Flowing like a river like the Congo, get it 
Why. You act like La-La and Po, Get it 
Fuck that bitch voice Young Dro, violent 
I ain't got tats, but my notebook inked up 
 Wan na collab feel free to link up 
200 songs. Later now the charts I'm climbing up 
In 2015, I'm gon na blow up 
I, got songs for every mood. Motivation, Check, 
Trap, Check., Chill Check. Grinding for the check 
LK on Check. AE on check. Creez on point check. 
Everybody asks: what's the AEking 
What, the fuck, you mean I'm the AEking 
AE shirts and AE jeans, my closet, pretty much AE everything 
And! That'S one penny cause, that's not gon change! 
Get! It cause a penny. You can't get no change.
