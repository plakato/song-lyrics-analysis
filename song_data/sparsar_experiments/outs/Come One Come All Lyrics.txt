Come One Come All Lyrics
by Visionaries.


Come one, come all.
To the Visionary hall.
I would like to.
Cordially invite you.
The night is young.
Might you.
Or shall I say, might we.
Develop a relationship rightly.
Rhettmatic will be our sound provider.
Strike a match to burn, we hold the mic tighter.
In light of the situation we got five emcees.
Of varying degrees and faculties.
Bring in the scratch, please.

Just learn from us.
A combustible bus of trust.
The inner analysis of us.
Unearthing palaces of dust.
I'm balancing with every gust of air.
Customers' Medicare.
Medical Musketeer with the musket there.
The son with the mussed up hair.
Declares that every nowhere.
Shall know everywhere.
My stocks are like sun colored blocks.
Brightest crayon in the box.
And the coldest beer in the fridge.

I told the dear it was a privilege.
Just to be in tune.
While the world's throwing darts at balloons.
I'm stuck in the dunes.
And scratch your platoon.
You're an asshole.
You're a hassle.
I'm master, fully astral.

Hands up.
This is a shakedown.
To take down.
The rest of you non-believing emcees.
Envious.
Of the way I adjust.
With a little bit of rage.
And rush to the middle of the stage.
And bust like TNT.
Must you believe it was started in a mid.
When it was being done to the left of the myriad.
Eons ago.
And beyond the flow.
We had continuity.
And fluidity.
Pure stupidity.
Has gotten some born on this coastal region.
Believing no ingenuity would be this close to home.
The truth'll be told through this microphone.
Behold a time when a fellowship of rhymes.
It beginning in the ninety-nine.
Furthest surface from the underside tide with the ride.

Come one, come all.
To the Visionary hall.
Ray Parker Jr. calls me when he needs a little bit of Ghostbusting.
West Coast hustling.
Every letter is a little lighter.
Lighting all you bent up biters.
Bitter firefighters.
Our girls are tighter.
My crew is flame retardant.
Your game's retarded.
My name is guarded and darted at.
And I'm a part of that.
California carnival.
Elephantiasis of the audible.
Innervating intervals.
My tabernacle.
Will tackle your tobacco.
Even my echoes are art deco.
All of my adlibs.
Are louder than the speakers at your crib.
