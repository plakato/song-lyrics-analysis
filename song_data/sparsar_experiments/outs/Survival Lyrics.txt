Survival Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

There's really nothing wrong.
No more for you to sing along to.
And it's a sad sad song cuz nothing's left here to hold onto.
This is the end of survival.
The end of all our lives.
And now I've seen the vision.
I saw the vision of your face emerging from the darkness of.
Something nothing can erase.
This is the end of survival.
The end of all our lives.
This is the end of denial.
We're running out of time.
