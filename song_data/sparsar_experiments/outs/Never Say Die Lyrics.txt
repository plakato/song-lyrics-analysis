Never Say Die Lyrics
by The Undead.


Sometimes when things don't seem so hot.
I give it everything I've got.
There's not much else to do.
So I just stick it through.
And then you'll see me standing tall.
I get knocked down but I don't cry.
I'll stand right up, you ask me why?
I'll tell you.
I'll never say die.
I'll never say die.
Don't give up and you will find.
Just what you're looking for.
Never say die!
Never say die!
Never say die!
Sometimes when living is the pits.
That's when I know I just can't quit.
You might say that I'm nuts.
But I know I've got the guts.
And I don't give a damn what you say.
And I'll never say die!
Never say die!
Never say die!
Die!
Sometimes when things don't seem so hot.
I give it everything I've got.
There's not much else to do.
So I just stick it through.
And then you'll see me standing tall.
I get knocked down but I don't cry.
I'll stand right up, you ask me why?
I'll tell you.
I'll never say die.
I'll never say die.
Don't give up and you will find.
Just what you're looking for.
Never say die!
Never say die!
Never say die!
