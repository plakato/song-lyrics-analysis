Strange Girl Lyrics
by The Zolas.

You were the deep well.
In earth-and-ocean class.
And on the days you showed.
I'd try to make you laugh.
Cliques drift and.
Converge in with a crash.
And there we were, desk to desk.
A young mountain and a strange girl.

And then we met again at university.
You said I came to you in a heavy dream.
Life in a Glass House, you said was your secret theme.
Sometimes you creep me out.
Have I ever told you you're a strange girl?

We were silver moths.
Around a naked bulb.
On my parents' porch that night.
It was love.
And it kept moving.

I know you oh so well.
Since we were 15.
So well I feel my joints.
When your weather's shifting.
I'll be your confidante.
Across the continents.
You may one day be queen.
But to me you'll always be that strange girl.
