These Shadows Lyrics
by Wooden Shjips.

When the moon rise I'down.
Soon as 'down the street.
And I travel down.
When the dark ?
And it so simple how.
For the ?
The sky braking down.
Get the feeling.
Ooh this shadows.
And this nothing I can accept ? down.
I'm just sitting for the way.
You've been sitting down.
