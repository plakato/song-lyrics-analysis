Pain Lyrics
by Ruth Lorenzo.

Since i was young.
I learnt that life wasn't going to be an easy one.
I knew i would have to find myself to survive.
Since i was young.
I learnt that life wasn't going to be an easy one.
I knew i would have to find myself to survive.
I took the tears and hide them all away.

I had to learn.
How to smile each day, how to face the world.
How to heal the scars from every battle and every fall.
Hot to cry myself to sleep without a sound.

Yes, I grew stronger.
But deep inside all i feel is pain.
All I've ever known is pain.
All I've ever felt is hurt.
Someone please take it away, take it away.

And yes, i'm not afraid to say.
That all i need is love.
That all i need is love.

So here i am, standing once again until the storm has passed.
Holding in my hands every piece of a broken heart.
Trying to hold on when i'm about to fall.

Yes, i grew stronger.
But deep inside all i feel is pain.
All i've ever known is pain.
All i've ever felt is hurt.
Someone please take it away, take it away.

And yes, i'm not afraid to say.
That all i need is love.
That all i need is love.

All i want is your love to guide me.
Love to take me home.
All i ask is for love to find me.
Love to carry on.

Pain.
All i've ever known is pain.
All i've ever felt is hurt.
Someone please take it away.
Some take it all away.

And yes, i'm not afraid to say.
That all i need is love.
That all i need is love.
