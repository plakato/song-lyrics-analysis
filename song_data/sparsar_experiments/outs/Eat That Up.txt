Well you would look a little better, don't you know.
If you just wore less make-up.
But it's hard to realize.
When you're sky high fighting off the spaceships.

And so you're drinking in your room to make it all go.
It didn't end too soon, you've got the next one.
You're holding on too long, you've gotta let go.
Your other love is gone and you know.

It's too late, it's too late.
You've got another one coming and it's gonna to be the same.
It's too late, it's too late.
You've got another one coming and it's gonna to be the same.

I tried to find a quiet place that we could go.
To help you make decisions.
But I didn't find it easy to tell them apart.
With double vision.

And so you're drinking in your room to make it all go.
It didn't end too soon, you've got the next one.
You're holding on too long, you've gotta let go.
Your other love is gone and you know.

It's too late, it's too late.
You've got another one coming and it's gonna to be the same.
It's too late, it's too late.
You've got another one coming and it's gonna to be the same.

It's not the same, it's not the same, it's not the same.
You're gonna tell me that I'm right,.
You know you're gonna come back down.
Find yourself where you are again.
You didn't know, you didn't know, you didn't know.
So don't pretend you saw it now.
It's not something you'd want to happen.
Now you know who you are again.
It's not the same, it's not the same, it's not the same.
You're gonna tell me that I'm right.
You know you're gonna come back down.
Find yourself where you are again.
