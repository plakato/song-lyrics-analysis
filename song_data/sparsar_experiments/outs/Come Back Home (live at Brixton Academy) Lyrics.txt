Come Back Home (live at Brixton Academy) Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

Another Saturday, another careless move.
Tells the world that you're thinking of what to do.
A window opens up and some one calls your name.
But I can tell you don't know how to play this game.

I know this isn't it.
You'll hit your target someday.

So now you're on your own, won't you come back home.
To see you're not that kind and find the strength, and find the strength.
To find another way.
To find another way.
To find another way.
To find another way.

So tell me what you need and I'll accommodate.
But if too long goes by you just might be too late.
An opportunity you can't afford to waste.
So have the lines in your head first for heaven's sake.

You hear the day beckoning.
Know what it's all in your head.

So now you're on your own, won't you come back home.
To see you're not that kind and find the strength, and find the strength.
To find another way.

So now you're on your own won't you come back home.
To see you're not that kind and find the strength, and find the strength.

So now you're on your own, won't you come back home.
To see you're not that kind and find the strength, and find the strength.
To find another way.
