Dad's Porsches Lyrics
by Ry.


The dream is always the same/.
In my room, I jet set for days/.
I arrived no set time or place/.
Its no lie, guess I'm inspired by, the chase/.

Press play, let things take their place, don't/.
Over think in extensive ways, though/.
My man kurt, said burn out than fade slow/.
I overheard, a friend say I ain't dope/.

Crucified, but I took it an run/.
Most guys play shows but they do it for fun/.
I'm trying to do it so I say look what I've become/.
Not a bitter old man saying I could of been one/.

My pursuit for perspective/.
If you're a true fan, then you'll tell dudes check this/.
I think out every move like a chess piece/.
Eyes on the sky, Coachella on the checklist/.

So until I get that thing ticked off/.
...I guess I'll have these older dudes ticked off?/.
It was written on the wall of the city hall/.
A good friend never leaves with a missed call/.

Talk about dreams, maybe how I chose them/.
Starting to believe that, maybe I was chosen/.
Inspired by art and the moment/.
Hard to achieve, but respect your opponent/.

And whatever surrounds/.
I could numb it with a drink maybe settle some rounds/.
Lost boys on the chase, no parents around/.
I guess I'm unfazed by, what they say to me now/.

Lost souls, we ain't feel that important/.
Few people ever sold me to the point of endorsement/.
Took everything I learnt, now press fast forward/.
I be in a studio making something that's awesome/.

Growing up in the city of orphans/.
Making fun of rich kids, sitting in dads porches/.
Middle finger to the sky, as we're skateboarding/.
And we're trying to survive, from this mundane boredom/.

But you know I been/.
Know where I been/.

But you won't find me/.
You won't find me/.

But you won't find me/.

Rare nights, from the outside looking in/.
Rare nikes, they're like damn Ry look at him/.
Flare lights, in this city of sin/.
Shine bright as these cars drive right up the strip/.

Something about rims, on a high class Benz/.
With Double Tint, make her wanna go and jump right in/.
It's like 4am, all good things end/.
As she leaves on my sheets one lipstick print/.

Sunroof peeling as I'm steering through my dreams/.
Running from the law and we're stealing everything/.
Pedal to floor, doors drop to our knees/.
We ain't running out of speed, she is everything i breathe/.

My hair long, I been gone a few months/.
Been knocked down, I dust off, I'm back up/.
Fascinated by true lies, they speak of/.
I take mine, It's too late, your times up/.
