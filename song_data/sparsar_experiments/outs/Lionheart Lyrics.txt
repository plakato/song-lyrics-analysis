Lionheart Lyrics
by Pup.

Oh Lionheart
Where, have you gone 
Oh-oh Oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh
All that you said
But you always lie
Aye-aye Aye-aye
Oh-oh Oh-oh
Oh Lionheart ... 

Oh Lionblood
Flowin'. Through my veins
Ay-ay Ay-ay
Oh-oh Oh-oh
You, said you'd try
If I promised to do the same
Ay-ay Ay-ay
Oh-oh Oh-oh
Oh Lionheart ... 
Oh Lionheart ..., 

Good luck

And good times

Let's get fucked

Let's, get high

Good. Luck

But, don't smile

Cuz, I know

You got a Lion: ... 

Oh Lionheart
Oh, Lionheart, ...,
