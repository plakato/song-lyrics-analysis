London to LA Lyrics
by Swindle.

At first glances, take a look 
Tell me what you see: 
Sunshine gang signs, hipster, chicks, 
With, a little ocean breeze, 
Far from good, not good from far 
Right down PCH 
Hopping on that red-eye flight 
From, London to LA .
 
Tell me what you see: 
With a little ocean breeze, 
Right down PCH 
From London to LA 
London, to LA-A-A 
 
Hopping on that red-eye flight 
From, London to LA .
 
Tell me what you see: 
With a little ocean breeze, 
Right down PCH 
From London to LA 
London, to LA-A-A 
 
At. First glances. Take a look! 
Tell me what you see: 
Sunshine gang signs, hipster, chicks, 
With, a little ocean breeze, 
Far from good, not good. From far 
Right down PCH 
Hopping on that red-eye flight 
From London to LA
