Look around the corner Lyrics
by Quantic.

With the Combo Barbaro.

Sing to me of your sadness and tell me of your joy.
Eyes wide open, sleep walking into the dawn.
Look around the corner, tell me what do you see?
Look around the corner, tell me what do you see?
Another day is born, another day is born.
Another day is born, rise up.
With the new light of the dawn.
Another day is born, another day is born.
Another day is here, another day is born.
Tell me what do you see?

We are made of the stars, you and I.
So enchanted, hypnotized by space and time.
Look around the corner, tell me what do you see?
Look around the corner, tell me what do you see?
Another day is born, another day is born.
Another day is born, rise up.
With the new light of the dawn.
Another day is born, another day is born.
Another day is here, another day is born.
Tell me what do you see?

From the lands of the lords of brightness.
And earliest recording of time.
Wheels never turning, ending as we once began.
Who knows if this is all there is.
Come the morning we get to start anew.
But we must tread wisely, till our days are done.
Look around the corner, tell me what do you see?
Look around the corner, tell me what do you see?
Another day is born, another day is born.
Another day is born, rise up.
With the new light of the dawn.
Another day is born, another day is born.
Another day is here, another day is born.
Tell me what do you see?
