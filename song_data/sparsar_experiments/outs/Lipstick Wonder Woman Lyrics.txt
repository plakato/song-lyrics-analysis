Lipstick Wonder Woman Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

Skip school, quit your job only a fool would miss this kind of occasion.

Rock you dancing shoes, Hollywood blues.
Take a permanent vacation.

Let your hair down, spin around downtown.
Give me that kiss amaze me.
Well everybody needs a little bit of love.
And a night that's a little bit crazy.

Take my hand, take my heart now honey, my super lady.
Lick your lips, shake your hips, we on the flip side.
Come on pretty mama amaze me.
Everybody needs a woman like that, with a kiss she saves the day.
If ever I'm in trouble, she's a running on the double.
With her lipstick wonder woman ways.

Black boots, white jeans, so tight, just right and oh so mean.
She moves fast in her pink sunglasses and busts out of that limousine.
The party scene was just getting bumping, and she's taking over me.
The stereo's up, so let's get down.
The hero and the villain believe.
