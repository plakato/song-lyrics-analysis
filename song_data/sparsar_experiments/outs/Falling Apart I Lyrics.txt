Falling Apart I Lyrics
by Xilent.

Feel the warmth of the razorlight that shines upon you.
Feel your heart while the world feels like its falling apart.
Take my hand while the whole wide world, it feels like drowning.
Need you now, don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.

Feel the warmth of the razorlight that shines upon you.
Feel your heart while the world feels like its falling apart.
Take my hand while the whole wide world, it feels like drowning.
Need you now, don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.
Don't let it fall apart.
