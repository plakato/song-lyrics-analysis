Isabel Lyrics
by The Wombats.


Two tickets to the rabbit hole, please.
I gave them half my earnings and all they gave me was this suite.
She's fuelling up whilst talking down to me.
God you must be the biggest caner this whole world has ever seen.
Take what you want from me, Isabel.

Isabel, you make it feel as though I've won and the dullest parts may never.
come.
Isabel, I'm much better, Isabel.
When you're ripping my life apart.
I think it's you that's the true rockstar around here.

It must be the oxygenated air.

its peak.
You grab me by the collar and whisper: What's in store for me?
Do what you will to me, Isabel.

Covered in your sweat and my fear.

I could do with keeping you, Isabel.

Around here.
Around here.
Around here.
