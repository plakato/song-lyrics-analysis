Beautiful life - acoustic Lyrics
by Union J.

She sees the world through TV screens.
All of her friends in magazines.
Ohh yeah.
But everyday she lives a broken dream, yeah.
Making her own reality.
There's lots of make up on her face.
To cover up an empty space.
But there's a lot behind those big blue eyes.
She just don't realize.
Everybody's gone and lost their mind.
It's just the days we live in.
Most of the time.
Get up out the dark.
Open up your eyes.
You'll discover there's a world outside.
To fix a broken heart.
You have to try.
Pick it up, pick it up.
It's a beautiful life.
Beautiful life, beautiful life.
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life.
He's got his fortune on the plate.
But all that money won't change fate.
He's got six zeros but no one to share it with no friends, no girl, no one in.
the world.
Everybody's gone and lost their mind.
It's just the days we live in.
Most of the time.
Yeah.
Get up out the dark.
Open up your eyes.
You discover there's a world outside.
To fix a broken heart.
You have to try.
Pick it up, pick it up.
It's a beautiful life.
Beautiful life, beautiful life.
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life.
We're not so different.
You and I.
Cause everybody's got a place to hide.
But it's just the days we live in.
Mmm, most of the time.
Get up out the dark.
Open up your eyes.
You discover there's a world outside.
To fix a broken heart.
You have to try.
Pick it up, pick it up.
It's a beautiful life.
Beautiful life, beautiful life.
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life.
Ahhhh,ooooooooooooh.
Beautiful life.
Beautiful life.
