Vanishing of Time Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

've seen the passing of the present and the future and it's alright.
I've seen the past and the vanishing of time and it's all fine.
I've seen the passing of the present and the future and it's alright.
I've seen the past and the vanishing of time and.

It's alright with me, I can't see the life I wrote.
It's all I need, I can't see the stars above.
I've gone out to sea, it's alright with me.
It's alright with me, it's alright with me, it's alright.

I've seen the passing of the present and the future and it's all.

It's alright with me, I can't see the life I wrote.
It's all I need, I can't see the stars above.
I've gone out to sea, it's alright with me.
It's alright with me, it's alright with me.
It's alright with me, it's alright with me.
It's alright with me, it's alright with me.
