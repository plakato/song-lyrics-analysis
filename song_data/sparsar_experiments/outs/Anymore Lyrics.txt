Anymore Lyrics
by Zion I.


I ain't tripping anymore, I ain't tripping anymore, 
I, feel so good 
I ain't tripping anymore. I ain't tripping anymore, 
I, feel so good 
 
And, I'm putting lease on everything. 
We was put on planet earth to manifest the higher things. 
But leviathans started. Shifting continents 
Now we on the vibe that I don't buy, a ... show you 
Watch me shift the paradigm. You can multiply it 
Own it to the end of time. Homie, don't deny it 
I'm fire in they eyes, rising higher in the iris 
I'm flier with osiris. This is vital heat applier 
Take it to the next dimension, nigga with no tension. Ah 
I am just a passenger for messengers to pass to ya. 
Higher swords is asking us slay the dragon us 
Hiding in the shadows of ourselves. It'S the battle. Yo 
 
I ain't tripping anymore, I ain't tripping anymore, 
I feel so good 
I ain't tripping anymore. I ain't tripping anymore, 
I, feel so good 
 
And, it's easy! Getting isolated, hide the light. It'S gone. 
Faded till the lights come on. 
Yeah I've been on that trippin doing extra things, 
Lucky that I'm blessed with wings slipping in my extra lanes. 
But some will never make it back across the battlefield. 
Them cheaters you should take it. 
Life is like a slow reveal still what we make it. 
And fragile, like an eggshell john picture record 
But, I never move in fear, though 
Steer with my inner ears and head to a clear road. 
On, a pathway blood seem the ashtray 
Legible astray, I'll return for a better 
Day. That'S my full ray phrases and letter 
And I'ma, let my mind spray ak's, berettas 
And, I'm through chasing cedars, I'm through with these feathers 
Meeting. You lasts forever. Ahhh 
, 
I ain't tripping anymore. I ain't tripping anymore, 
I feel so good 
I ain't tripping anymore. I ain't tripping anymore, 
I feel so good 
I feel so good 
I feel so good today
