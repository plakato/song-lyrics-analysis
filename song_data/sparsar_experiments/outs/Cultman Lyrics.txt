Cultman Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Come and rise from your grave again.
Rise above them and fight again.
I'm the one you're calling.
And watch me - show them all.
Without me you'll be obscene.
I'll save you from it all.

Release your confessions.
Give your life to me.
Let me open your sewn shut eyes.
See only me.
I'm the one you're calling.
And watch me - show them all.
Obey me until your life is lost.

Come to me with sorrow.
I'll let you live again.
There is no tomorrow.
I am your only friend.
Your time has been so sick.
You're living in sorrow and pain.
There is no tomorrow - take my hand.

What is it inside you eating you within?
I drown in life's waters.
A sea of despair.
Hear me now I'm calling.
So you can see the way to me.
I'll leave you blind and hopeless.
You should have never listened to me.

Come to me with sorrow.
I'll let you live again.
There is no tomorrow.
I am your only friend.
Your time has been so sick.
You're living in sorrow and pain.
There is no tomorrow - take my hand.

I'm the one you're calling.
And watch me - show them all.
Without me you'll be obscene.
I'll save you from it all.
Release your confessions.
Give your life to me.
Let me open your sewn shut eyes.
See only me again.
