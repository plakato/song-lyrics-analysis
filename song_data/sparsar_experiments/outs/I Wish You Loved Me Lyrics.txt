I Wish You Loved Me Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

Something.
Something as simple as me hearing your name.
Puts me.
Puts me in a place that I can't even explain.

I really didn't know back then.
But right now I am totally sure.
Baby I know I'm your friend.
But I wanna be much more.
Oooh.
I get butterflies when I see you coming.
Oh boy you got me running.
This feeling in my stomach.
Tells me I should be your woman.
Cause your the only one who makes my fairytale come true.

How can someone make me so sad.
But still I only want you to stay.
I wanna say I love you so bad.
But I don't wanna scare you away.
Please.
I wish that you'll understand.
That I wanna be more than just your friend.
I wish you loved me.

I see, I see you talking to them girls on your phone.
Ummm.
I wish I could that I could tell them all to leave you alone.
Ooo.

Really didn't know back then.
But right now I'm totally sure.
Woooaaah.
That I wanna be much more.

I never really liked your girlfriends.
Never really gave them a chance.
Cause I realized that I'm your woman.
Your woman.

How can someone make me so sad.
But still I only want you to stay.
I wanna say I love you so bad.
But I don't wanna scare you away.
Please I wish that you'll understand.
That I wanna be more than just your friend.
I wish you loved me.

Said if you really love somebody.
I mean really really really really love somebody.
Let me hear you say yeah.

Let me hear you say yea yea.

If you really know you need him.
And you know deep down your never gonna leave him.

Let me hear you say yea yea yea.

Hear you say yeeeeeeaaaaaah.

How can someone make me so sad.
But still I only want you to stay.
I wanna say I love you so bad.
But I don't wanna scare you away.
Please I wish that you'll understand.
That I wanna be more than just your friend.
I wish you loved me.
How can someone make me so sad.
But still I only want you to stay.
I wanna say I love you so bad.
But I don't wanna scare you away.
Please I wish that you'll understand.
That I wanna be more than just your friend.
I wish you loved me.
