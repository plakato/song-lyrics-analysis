Knight Baggy Lyrics
by АК-47.

His name is Knight Baggy and he is my friend.
Forever and ever, ever, ever again.
He's cozy in the castle, but he lives in the woods.
Hunting every bad guy like a true Robin Hood.
Every young maiden in this deserted land.
Wants to marry Knight Baggy and to hold his hand.
His medieval spirit still shines likes the sun.
So if he's comin' at ya then you better run.

Refrain:.
Knight Baggy.
He is my friend.
Forever and ever again.
Knight Baggy.
You are the man.
Forever and ever again.

Forever and ever, Knight Baggy is clever.
He's rougher, he's tougher, no one else is better.
He's the king of the hill on the top of his horse.
He's the master of all living warriors.
Fear not when he's out of sight.
Our hero's back before the fall of the night.
His medieval spirit shines through out the land.
With the blade in his hands.
He's strong, he's the man.

Refrain.
