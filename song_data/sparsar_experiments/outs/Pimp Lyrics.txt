Yung nation 
, 
Uhh Well lets get to business 
All. You boys, some snitches 
And yall tryna. Take my riches. 
Ya girl grant my wishes. 
She came and did my dishes 
Sending me hugs and Kisses 
But Naww, Im just pimpin 
 
Pimp 
Im, a young Pimp. 
Catch me eating on Steak and Shrimp 
Geeked up on a cloud 
Write, my name on a blimp 
Im, just a young pimp, 
Nigga im, just a young pimp, 
Black blunts, no skimp, 
 
Gone walk with a limp 
Fresh Fade New Trimm 
Gone. Put me on flim 
Nigga Gone put me on flim 
 
H-H-How, you doin baby 
Im the real deal. I pimp 
I ball like Sean Kimp, 
And your boyfriend. He a trimp 
Summer cast in my pocket 
Make. My ass walk with a limp 
Tell yo girl when she cook 
I, like extra pasta with shrimp 
And. You know I got the munchies 
So, I back door M and M's. I pack 
Big sausage and you packin, Slim jim 
I ball, like a fucking, Gym. 
I ball way above the rim. 
My money tall, like tim, 
Dunkin, Dunkin 
I, get ya girl. One night 
The next day, im punchin 
Her booty bigger than a pumpkin 
I swear to god. Im, not stunting 
I get her in my bed and all night 
Im hunchin. Until I see the 
Sun or somethin 
I still see us on the seats, 
Im still suckin her tits 
30 mins laterr. I have a hard dick 
Guess. What I wake herr 
And make her ride. My stick: 
And pass it to big Nick 
Thats real pimpin like a bitch 
Ahhh Yesss ...,

Pimp 
Im, a young Pimp. 
Catch me eating on Steak.
