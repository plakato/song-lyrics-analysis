WeatherMan Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Call me WeatherMan I'm wherever man.
It's so hard trying to keep some cash in.
Now I'm sending ice out of all directions.
Why this world gotta work like this.

Ridin' down the PCH.
sipping on some PCP.
Rhyming that's a piece of cake so I'll always eat for free.
Say the game in need of me cause I don't even need a beat.
Say I mean a lot to rap but that don't mean a thing to me.
Rather grow old get a place out in the forest.
On the porch of my cabin smoking dope eating porridge.
Ounce of the snow coming down on the road.
White skin like Jack Frost got your bitch cold, let it go.
Every night I'm dying slow.
Eyes never closed cause you never never know.
