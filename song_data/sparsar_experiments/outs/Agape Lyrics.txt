Agape Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.

Chours:.
Love.
Yeah one love.
That's love.
We ain't worried about the hate my n*gga.
Just love.
Yeah.

Most n*ggas don't know what love is or what ain't.
But I'm here to tell you what is.
Man if I ain't the realest then who the fuck is.
I seen brothers violating their mothers.
That ain't gonna cut it cuz.
Love is unconditional.
Unpredictable.
Once you listen to someone that's giving you.
More than they give they self.
Gotta remember their path.
Won't leave you hanging they'll probably give you his last.
Won't let you smoke he'll throw your cigs in the trash.
Even though you try to fight him.
He'll put that shit in the past.
Can't see you hurt yourself.
Till you murk yourself.
He rather see you outwork yourself.
Gotta stay away from negative people.
Even if they relatives.
Once was an angel turned devil.
The devil is closer than you think.
My n*gga past blood.
I'm hoping that you pray for me.

Cuz that's love.
Yeah one love.
Yeah that's love.
And we ain't worried about the hate my n*gga.
Just love.
Yeah.

Most women ain't never had love.
Too busy giving they number out while they at clubs.
If that's love then what do you call lust.
If that's love then what do you call trust.
No wonder you all stuck.
No wonder you broads fucked up.
In the head in the bed with the next n*gga.
On the ground the caption says he's the best n*gga.
Then one month later he's your ex-n*gga.
We ain't impressed.
Let the n*ggas be n*ggas and men be men.
Wasted all that time for an MCM.
So what if he bought a fucking purse.
When your ass got sick did he become a nurse.
Did he support your grind knowing you love your work.
Did he make any changes for what it's worth.
That's what I thought.
My's it's looking like you lost my.
That shit is priceless.
Love don't cost my.
So now you know that's love.

One love.
That's love.
And we ain't worried about the hate no more.
Just love x2.
Yeah just love.

Take a couple bars off let Tony look.
That's love.
Y'all rap n*ggas gotta start showing y'all producers love my n*ga.
Yeah one take man.
Man I love Ricky L's I ain't even gotta say it.
In a trap so long he ain't even gotta weigh it.
Shout out to my parents they're my number one fans.
Mama know the words I ain't even gotta play it.
Yeah I love Diana but I hate it when she fed it.
My n*gga P taught me about the cadence.
My cousin in Cali glad he saw his cousin made it.
But I don't feel I made it till both of us make it.
So both of us take it to a whole hunned acres.
On the road doing shows.
N*ggas know I'm the greatest.
Got a bond and I don't wanna break it down.
We the fucking underdogs but we so underrated.
How you get an opportunity and don't wanna take it.
Man I love my God.
N*ggas know why I'm playing.
I be so wide awake and I get no sleep.
If mad men don't eat then I won't eat.
Now that's love.

Yeah yeah.
One love.
Shit crazy.
Yeah that's love.
And we ain't worried about the hate my n*gga.
Just love.
Yeah just love.
That's love.
Love.
That's love.
Love.
That's love.
