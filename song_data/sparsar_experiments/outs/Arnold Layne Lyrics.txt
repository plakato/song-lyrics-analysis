Arnold Layne Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

Arnold Layne had a strange hobby collecting clothes.
Moonshine washing line, they suit him fine.
On the wall hung a tall mirror distorted view.
See through baby blue he dug it.
Oh Arnold Layne, it's not the same.
Takes two to know, two to know.
Two to know, two to know.
Why can't you see.
Arnold Layne Arnold Layne, don't do it again.
Now he's caught a nasty sort of person.
They gave him time doors clang chain gang he hates it.
