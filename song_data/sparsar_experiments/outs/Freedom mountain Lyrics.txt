Freedom mountain Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: Silver Haze.
Freedom mountain.
Leaving for tomorrow.
Cause I'm tired of today High above the mountains.
In an April sky I sway.
Oh - Yeah I'm tired of today.
Oh - In an April sky I sway.
And I lay myself down.
Yeah I lay myself.
Down on the freedom mountain.
I think it's here I'll seek protection.
To escape the ricochet.
Like a fireball it's speeding.
So I think I'd better stay.
Oh - to escape the ricochet.
Oh - Yeah I think I'd better stay.
