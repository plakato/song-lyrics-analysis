Trash Lyrics
by Tyler Glenn.


I think I lost myself in your new religion.
You say a prayer for me like a.
superstition.
We were always made for love.
We could always speak in tongues.
On my knees and I'm seeing visions.
Yeah, you remind me that seven sins are deadly.
You used to baptize me when I wasn't ready.
Water never turns to wine.
I've been drinking all the time.
I think of you whenever I see fire in the sky.

Your friends think I'm a freak.
What was in my drink?
I can't even think, but we got history.
In all of this, I lost myself.
Maybe I'll see you in hell.
Okay, whatever.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

I said my flesh is weak but the spirit's willing.
And you would sell my soul just to make the killing.
If you wanted me to stay.
I'd repent my days away.
I think of you when I see fire in the sky.

Your friends think I'm a freak.
What was in my drink?
I can't even think, but we got history.
In all of this, I lost myself.
Maybe I'll see you in hell.
Okay, whatever.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

You keep throwing me out like.
You keep throwing me out like.
You keep throwing me out like.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

Your friends think I'm a freak.
What was in my drink?
I can't even think, but we got history.
In all of this, I lost myself.
Maybe I'll see you in hell.
Okay, whatever.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
