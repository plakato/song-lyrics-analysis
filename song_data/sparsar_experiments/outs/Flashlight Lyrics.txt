Flashlight Lyrics
by Syd tha Kyd.

Ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh baby.
Ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh.

My heart, it's with you now.
But do you know how to love me?
Your heart it beats for me.
I'm the only thing you've got to hold onto.
My mind tells me to let you go.
But my heart said no.

My mind tells me that this is wrong.
But your love's too strong.
And now I'm caught in the middle.
You took away my flashlight.
Now I'm walking in the dark.
Thinking why'd I even stop to think.
That this could be love.
Is it too late to turn back now?
Now that I've given you my heart.
Before this whole thing falls apart.
But could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?

I'm no longer safe when you look my way.
You've become my everything.
Is this a mistake?

Baby, when you put put that thing on me.
I just can't explain.
This is a mistake.

And I hate to be selfish, baby.
But what about me?
If you leave you take it all.

You know I wouldn't leave you, baby.
So say you'll be mine.
Maybe together we'll find.
The words that describe love.
If what we both feel inside is love.

You took away my flashlight.
Now I'm walking in the dark.
Thinking why'd I even stop.
To think that this could be love.
Is it too late to turn back?
Now that I've given you my heart.
Before this whole thing falls apart.
But could this be love, love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love, love?
Could this be love? Love, yeah.

Is this in love?
I'm just riding with you.
Baby, I hope this never ends.
Let's make it last forever.

Baby, hold on.
Hold on, baby.
