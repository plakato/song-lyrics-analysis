So Long Lyrics
by Rumor.


You know!
Yo Pee!
I Love this one!
Its me!
Yeah, Rumor!
Okay!

While you're tryna wish on a star.
I'm out here tryna reach for the stars.
It's all clear I wouldn't make it this far without God.
That's why I'm tryna preach with my bars.
Shouts out to my cats better yet my okras.
In the streets with their nostrils possessed by catarrh.
Who say it's a hustle in the streets of Accra?
Everything they heard about the city was a fa√ßade.
Till you feel under the weather.
No matter what it is your storm could be weathered.
It's just a matter of time.
Look at me it was just a matter of rhymes.
It don't matter where from it's where you headed.

Dem figure say we no go make am.
They're so wrong.
They're so wrong.
They're so wrong.
If they ask you where I'm at just tell'em I am so gone.
So long, So long.

I said welcome to my sunny days, I meant that literally.
You see the sun dey blaze and it's killing me.
I wear my hat and shades and they're shielding me.
I'm heading to that place where they're feeling me.
So turn my mic on and turn the lights on.
And just for one night, I'll be your icon.
Please play the instruments, let me get into it.
Those Paapa influenced look what I did to'em.
After the show we smile for the cameras.
And say hello to the fans, friends and followers.
We wouldn't make it without all of y'all.
So thank you, thank you for your support.
Great parties and celebratory dinners.
Greater is He who is in us.
Look what he made out of a sinner.
Hash tag triple-f you know the business.
