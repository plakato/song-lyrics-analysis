March Of The Black And White Roses Lyrics
by Vogue.

I am a ghost town man living in a blue desert.
Eating sand beneath your girlfriend's skirt.
I am a ghost town man living in a blue desert.
Living like a tick in the thick fur of the earth.

Touch me!
Touch my rancid heart.
My crooked grin cheeks caved in.
My girl skin guitar turned in the key of your starvation.

To howl with the hounds and let your children living underground.
I'm just sitting here playing my guitar.
While the rest of the world sleeps in quicksand chrysalis.
To howl with the hounds and let your children living underground.
I'm just sitting here playing my guitar.
While the rest of the world sleeps in quicksand chrysalis.

Croon children croon; outside your cocoon.
Sleep and never see the light of day.
Croon children croon; outside your cocoon.
The sky is falling like skin flakes.

To howl with the hounds and let your children living underground.
I'm just sitting here playing my guitar.
While the rest of the world sleeps in quicksand chrysalis.
To howl with the hounds and let your children living underground.
I'm just sitting here playing my guitar.
While the rest of the world sleeps in quicksand chrysalis.
To howl with the hounds and let your children living underground.
