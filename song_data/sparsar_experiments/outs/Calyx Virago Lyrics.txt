Calyx Virago Lyrics
by Xandria.

Fading lights, I sink into.
This other world, where only you.
Can heal my wounds and make me see.
Only here I'm free.
You are the night with all its charm.
Glowing darkness keeps me warm.
Take my life - just one caress.
Let me be forever yours.
Close your eyes.
Fading lights, I sink into.
This other world.
