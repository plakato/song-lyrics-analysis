by The X-Ecutioners.

I was in this club just the other day 
And. I saw the X-ecutioners that made me wan na say: 
They were cuttin' it up. Scratchin' it with both hands. 
They sounded so good. They made everybody dance. 
 
Scratching, yes, vocal. 
 
As the'X' kept fading. They were rockin', the crowd. 
Everybody was movin' to the hypnotic. Sound 
They were cuttin' it up. Scratchin' it with both hands. 
They sounded so good. They made everybody dance. 
 
Scratching. I love this song. Vocal. 
, 
The music was hittin'. The bass kept pumpin' 
Nobody was sittin'. ,'X' got the whole club jumpin' 
 
It was Rob Swift, Total Eclipse, Roc Raida 
Tearin' it up. Yeah flippin' the crossfader 
 
Scratching, like this yeah vocals. 
 
They were cuttin' it up. Scratchin' it with both hands. 
They sounded so good. They made everybody dance. 
, 
The music was hittin', the bass kept pumpin' 
Nobody was sittin', ,'X' got the whole club jumpin' 
 
It was Rob Swift, Total Eclipse, Roc Raida 
Tearin' it up. Yeah flippin' the crossfader 
 
Scratching turn it up blow come on vocals. 
 
By. The end of the night, the whole vibe felt right. 
Yeah the X-ecutioners made the music sound tight, 
 
It was Rob Swift, Total Eclipse, Roc Raida 
Tearin' it up. Yeah flippin' the crossfader 
 
Scratching X-ecutioners, like this vocals.
