Kid Tested Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

We're hitting up hot spots and hospitals to find the life you left behind.
She wastes her weekdays painting the night sky and her weekends chasing.
broadway lights.

Pick your poison for the perfect drink.

You're turning headlights with just one sip.

She says I got the best sheets in town.
But takes it back she knows I'm not around.

She says I got the best sheets in town.
But takes it back she knows I'm not around.

You know how we do, just wait til I get my hands on you.
I'll go home with a black eye cause you're going home with some other guy.

Taking cheap shots I'm down for the count.
She's turning headlights with just one sip.

She says I got the best sheets in town.
But takes it back she knows I'm not around.

She says I got the best sheets in town.
But takes it back she knows I'm not around.

You're blowing smoke rings in my general direction.
Is that what you call a display of affection?

You're blowing smoke rings in my general direction.
Is that what you call a display of affection?

Oh I want the fire back in my lungs.
Can't wait to taste her firewater back on my tongue.
She makes me promise not to tell what she's done.
But I'll give her up cause I'm giving up.
Pick your poison for the perfect drink.

AW YEAH!!

She says I got the best sheets in town.
But takes it back she knows I'm not around.

She says I got the best sheets in town.
But takes it back she knows I'm not around.
