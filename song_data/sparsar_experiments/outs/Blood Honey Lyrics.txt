Blood Honey Lyrics
by XOV.


Tell me what you want from me, want from me?
I just want your blood honey, blood honey.
You know what you are to me, are to me.
Nothing but spilled blood honey, blood honey.

Blood honey, blood honey.

Blood honey, blood honey.

With you I felt it, this euphoria.
I saw the peaks of my utopia.
We talked about a life in Saigon.
To leave it all and move to the sun.

But you broke our code of honor.
You set fire to my nirvana.
Now you want me back again.
But I just wanna get even.

Tell me what you want from me, want from me?
I just want your blood honey, blood honey.
You know what you are to me, are to me.
Nothing but spilled blood honey, blood honey.

Blood honey, blood honey.

Blood honey, blood honey.

There was a time I wanted vengeance.
But staying mad and hurt makes no sense.
I even thought about forgiveness.
To let it go without regrets.

But you broke our code of honor.
You set fire to my nirvana.
Now you want me back again.
But I just wanna get even.

Tell me what you want from me, want from me?
I just want your blood honey, blood honey.
You know what you are to me, are to me.
Nothing but spilled blood honey, blood honey.

Blood honey, blood honey.

Blood honey, blood honey.
