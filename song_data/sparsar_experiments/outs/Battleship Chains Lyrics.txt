Battleship Chains Lyrics
by Volbeat.


You got me tied down with battleship chains.
Fifty foot long and a two ton anchor.
Tied down with battleship chains.
Fifty foot long with a two ton anchor.

I can't move my arms.
To hold nobody.
Hold nobody but you.
I can't move my legs.
To chase nobody.
To kick nobody but you.

You got me tied down with battleship chains.
Fifty foot long and a two ton anchor.
Tied down with battleship chains.
Fifty foot long and a two ton anchor.

I can't move eyes.
To see nobody.
See nobody but you.
I can't move my tongue.
To taste nobody.
To lick nobody but you.

You got me tied down with battleship chains.
Fifty foot long and a two ton anchor.
Tied down with battleship chains.
Fifty foot long and a two ton anchor.

I can't move my lips.
To kiss nobody.
Kiss nobody but you.
I can't move my heart.
To love nobody.
To love nobody but you.

You got me tied down with battleship chains.
Fifty foot long and a two ton anchor.
Tied down with battleship chains.
Fifty foot long and a two ton anchor.

You got me tied, tied.
Whoo hoo, tied tied.
Don't you know you got me.
Tied tied, whoo hoo.
Baby don't you know you got me.
Tied tied, whoo hoo.
