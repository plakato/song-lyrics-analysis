Holiday Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

I wasn't looking for things to do.
I wasn't looking for something new, but that's what I found you.
That's when I found you.
You took my hand and we took it slow.
We fell together like flakes of snow on a blanket down below.
On a blanket down below.

And you said.
Does anything feel strange?
Cause you're like a perfect dream &amp; I'm afraid to awake.
I'll lose it all somehow.
Cause every since you came, I've been living in a holiday, a holiday.

So I dream a little more, dream a little more.
But I can't shake this feeling.

So tell me why did you feet get cold?
I know intentions are as good as gold, even good things just get old.
Even good things just get old.

I never know when to act real tough.
You never thought that I would good enough so I just kept giving up.
Yeah we're always giving up.

Does anything feel strange?
Cause you're like a perfect dream &amp; I'm afraid to awake.
I'll lose it all somehow.
Cause every since you came, I've been living in a holiday, a holiday.

So I'm standing at your door.
Tears falling like the rain.
And I'm calling out your name cause I know you hear me.

Do you remember me?
I'm the one you could never leave.
Remember me?!
I'm the one you thought you could never leave.

Does anything feel strange?
Cause you're like a perfect dream that I can't seem to escape.
I wanna lost it all somehow.
Cause every since you came, I've been living in a holiday, a holiday.

Now, every flame just goes cold.
All the summers fade and no one that I hold can make me feel quite the same.
Cause ever since you came, I've been living in a holiday, a holiday.

So I dream a little more, dream a little more.
But I can't shake this feeling.
