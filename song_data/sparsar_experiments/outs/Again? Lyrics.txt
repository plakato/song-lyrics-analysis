Again? Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Echoes from the past lingers.
Through my head... Again.
Days turned to years and.
Years turned to love.

I thought I had lost you.
I thought you'd lost me too.

Silence told me you name.
When I was slowly going insane.
Carried me away.
Into the day....

Is there still time to say the words.
Is there still life in those enchanted eyes.

All the faded memories, they come back to me.
A play of silence, before my eyes.
You gave me memories and you gave me life.
All my sadness, was swept away.

Dancing close to maybe.
Through marble halls of me.
Years turned to days and.
Days turned to love... Again?

All the faded memories, they come back to me.
A play of silence, before my eyes.
You gave me memories and you gave me life.
All my sadness was swept away.
