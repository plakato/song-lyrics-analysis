No War Can Be Won Lyrics
by The Virus.

Training children, trained to kill.
Teaching hatred, no free will.
Breeding perfect killing machines.

Fathers take them on the hunt.
Video games of gore and blood.
Desensitizing them loss of life.

For the sake of future children.
No war No war can be one.

Just like they learn from T.V.
Movies, games, and history.
He who kills the most is the biggest man.

When little boys have little guns.
Little tanks and little bombs.
Training them to kill from day one.

For the sake of future children.
No war No war can be one.

For scholarship will you sell your soul?
Killing babies while on patrol.
What's the price of innocent lives?

Too much, too much human greed.
In a fire storm of hell we lead.
The next evolution's extinction.

For the sake of future children.
No war No war can be one.
