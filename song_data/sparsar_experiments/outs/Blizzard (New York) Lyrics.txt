Blizzard (New York) Lyrics
by XO.

Do you remember when we ran.
Through the blizzard from the train station?
The snow in New York covered up half of the door.
And yet we still would brave it.
All we could do was sit practice our tunes.
And maybe watch an episode of lost.
We slept on the blow up mattress.
And talked about how lucky we were to be here.
You helped me through the door.
That we've stared at since I can remember.
I'd watch the city from the window on the train.
You can't sit still for anything.
But it's out stop so it won't matter anyway.
It was early December when the call.
From our leader established our new assignment.
In Atlanta we tried to make things work.
But found ourselves feeling mixed up.
I couldn't write anymore.
And so we packed all of our things.
And headed north for the spring.
I was finally single for once.
Then tour finally started, we had our friends.
And our guitars ready to take on the unknowing world.
You helped me through the door.
That we've stared at since I can remember.
And we knew there was so much more.
Now this is life, yeah, this is what we've waited for.
I'd watch the city from the window on the train.
You can't sit still for anything.
But it's our stop so it won't matter anyway.
Do you remember?
