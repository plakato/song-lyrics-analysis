You know. You can't run brought down to one
Whatcha. Gon' do comin' through comin' through

It's the boys from way down south
Backed up by Jay's D
I know you really wan na get wild
I know you wan na get loose now
Ain't! No shame to my game
I got ta raise the roof and that's the truth
Clap, your hands stomp, your feet
Feel, the power in the street

Ray Nealy
Uh. Oh watch out here I come
The big bad brotha oughtta, bring you some
All the pain that I bring on the field
When. You hear the word Nealy think
Break through the safty valve
Break it down. Nutha words break it. Out
If that don't work then I take you. Down
You felt the rest. Now feel the best

Daryl Gardener
So who's y'all wan na see
It's, Daryl Gardner. You know it's me
I, keep more coming like Michael Mark fire
Make, you searchin' for tires
Runnin' through ways to make you well
Thirty two ways to break you down
Thirty two ways to give you some
Uhoh watch out cuz here. I come

Anthony Harris
Let Ant just ride. Out
You won't stay for lunch. I'M gon', try it out
My wonderful, feel in microphone. Uh
When we stop. The mic is gone
Like. This dat, dat and this
Miami's down here on the trial
But. I just couldn't miss it
Swing it over like a cherry, y'all

Ed Perry
Break. It down one time
Whassup, with'89
I ain't that hard to find
I what y'all ride the pine
I bust through lines like a maniac
Prayer ain't gon', bring you back
Let's all start the eulogy
Now. What the hell ya gon' do with me

Duston Anderson
In, the middle of the field. The stadium's packed
The crowd was roarin' the time to attack
30 long, what it gon', be
I'm comin' round the corner for the QB
Can't run or hide from the take down D
Make another team still like Queens. I'M mean
From Miami. This is Anderson and the QCD
Ain't no thing, but a chicken wing
Ain't gon' stop till I get another ring now

Check it out. Here we go
Ride on out
Yo. It'S about that time
Comin' break through the line
You know. You can't run brought down to one
Whatcha. Gon' do comin' through comin' through
Now, say hut, two hut: two, that's it!
