Chamber of Lament Lyrics

Chamber of Lament.
Produced By Vo-Kal.

Guilt tripping.
But I've been fallin for the wrong type.
And by the look up in your eyes.
You were right I'm now the wrong guy.
Once fucked over blame me.
They thought they could all tame me.
Bring the ocean tide in closer.
And realize I'm not the same me.
Monstrous.
I don't recognize.
Myself.
I'm cloaked in disguise.
To hide the pain.
Of past decisions.
Infatuations.
So shallow.
Just brought me down to the.
Gallows.
I hanged myself.
By being hung up on the bitches.
Swallow.
Your soul and steal your heart.
So now it's missing.
And now I'm missing.
The pieces of me worth representing.
Wish I held on from the beginning.
And I can't feel the pain or the pleasure.
I'm numb to the beauty, potential treasure, the happiness you could measure.
So I'm spilling out my heart to stripper named May Jane.
Maybe her ass is bigger than the weight that's on my brain.
But I can't assume some flimsy lust is gonna hold these ties.
Holding back my memories feeding myself some more lies.
And deceit.

Taking over my body.
I don't need your hope.
Taking over my soul.
I don't need your faith controlling.
All my inhibitions.
Just stay away from me.
I'll forever be free.

You say that you want me.
You say that you need me.
But I can't hear that shit no more.
Cause it taking me back now.
When I would believe you.
And I would fall for you once more.
But I don't want to see the changes.
Or who I've become.
Because now you're just an option.
To try and make me cum.
Cause bitch I do this often.
I've fallen for make up.
I've fallen for a-cups.
From grace that I've fallen.
This dance that I'm stalling.
To try and get ass in my face.
Pussy poppin'.
Cause I was what you needed.
Now I'm what you want.
I was the recipe.
Now I'm your last hope.
So baby grab hold.
Enjoy yourself.
Just know.

I don't need your love.
Taking over my body.
I don't need your hope.
Taking over my soul.
I don't need your faith controlling.
All my inhibitions.
Just stay away from me.
I'll forever be free.
