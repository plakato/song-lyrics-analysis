Come back my love Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Oh-oh, come back my love, don't run away.
Come back my love, oh come back to stay.
I love you so, well I want you to know.
I need your love so badly.

Well, you said goodbye, I wondered why.
All because of those silly lies.
I love you so, well I want you to know.
I need your love so badly.

Well, everybody makes.
Mistakes in the game of romance.
I'm asking you darling.
Why don't you come back and give me a chance.

Come back my love, don't stay away.
I need your loving every day.
I love you so, well I want you to know.
I need your love so badly.

Well, everybody makes.
Ooh, mistakes in the game of romance.
Now, I'm asking you darling.
Why don't you come back and give me a chance.

Come back my love, don't stay away.
I need your loving every day.
I love you so, well I want you to know.
I need your love so badly.

Well, everybody makes.
Ooh, mistakes in the game of romance.
Now, I'm asking you darling.
Why don't you come back and give me a chance.

Come back my love, don't stay away.
I need your loving every day.
I love you so, well I want you to know.
I need your love so badly.
Cause I need your love so badly.
