Be Chrool To Your Scuel Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Be cruel to your school 
Cause, you may never get another 
Be cruel to your school 
In, the name of rock and roll 
Be, cruel to your school 
Just like a sister or a brother, 
Be cruel to your school 
In, the name of rock and roll 
 
Well. I don't think i'll make it through another day: 
It's eight o'clock and all ain't well, 
My brain hurts so much it's startin' to decay. 
And, I'm livin' in my private hell, 
Didn't somebody tell me this would be so great 
Be. The best thing I ever had 
How come: they never told me'bout. The word exaggerate 
How'd somethin', so good get so bad. 
Cause, hey, I got ta, know 
Am, I slow 
Where. Do I go from here: 
Do abc's, 
And 123's. 
Mean that much to me that much to me me me me me me me 
 
Be, cruel to your school 
Cause. You may never get another 
Be cruel to your school 
In, the name of rock and roll 
Be, cruel to your school 
Just like a sister or a brother, 
Be cruel to your school 
In, the name of rock and roll 
 
Sing. It Alice 
, 
Alice, Cooper, 
, 
I, see them walkin''round like the livin' dead 
Ain't. They got nothin' between their ears 
How come they don't seem to hear a single word. I say: 
They ain't, the only ones who're bored to tears, 
Now. There must be a better way to educate 
Cause. This way. Ain'T workin', like it should 
Can't they just invent a pill or frozen, concentrate 
That makes you smarter and taste mmm, so good, 
Cause, hey, I got ta, know 
What I'll have to show 
When. I hi-hi-ho it from here. 
Will I be in pain 
Or. Will I have a brain 
Or? Will I go insane? I'Ve gone insay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ane, 
, 
Cause, hey, i got ta know 
What I'll have to show 
When. I hi-hi-ho it from here 
Do abc's and 123's 
Mean that much to me 
That much to me me me me me me me me me 
 
Be, cruel to your school 
Cause. You may never get another 
Be cruel to your school 
In, the name of rock and roll 
Be, cruel to your school 
Just like a sister or a brother, 
Be cruel to your school 
In, the name of rock and roll 
 
Be cruel to your school 
Cause. You may never get another 
Be cruel to your school 
In, the name of rock and roll 
Be, cruel to your school 
Just like a sister or a brother, 
Be cruel to your school 
In, the name of rock and roll 
All right
