Nigga Fuckit Lyrics
by 50/50 Twin.

Yung Ro - 4x.
Well nigga fuck it.
Nigga fuck it.
If you mad so what, well nigga fuck it.

Big Pokey.
Fuck it, I'm agg'd and tripping with this heater.
I'm a Texas stampeder, M.O.B. ring leader.
Crack fiend feeder, me and my niggas we hoggish.
If you feel froggish, jump get bit by these walrus.
When my bullets be flipping, niggas wings be ripping.
When I unload the clip slipping, with seats unzipping.
I'm a ditch digger, go rob and get rich nigga.
The M.O.B. in this bitch nigga, we yanking your card.
Bitch niggas thinking they hard, but soft as a sponge.
Don't make this twelve gauge barrel, cough at your lungs.
I'm a mob boss handcuff her, or get your broad tossed.
Kidnap her, then you gotta pay the mob cost.
A bunch of these niggas lost, a bunch of these niggas lame.
My assault rifles rain, and puncture these niggas brains.
Uncut cocaine, you know me.
Sensei S.U.C., M.O.B.

50/50 Twin.
I don't Crip Walk, but I could make a person walk in cripple.
Get out of line, 50/50 haul off and kill you.
Tats on my flesh why, cause I'm a raw civilian.
A hater wanna be fly, I throw him off a building.
I ain't the club type, but if I go and plex follow.
I buy the whole bar, and start throwing Moet bottles.
Halfway home you get shot up, by my smoking wet partnas.
I pull up like a mob boss, and choke your neck partna.
When it come to these hoes, you already know.
I keep they knees on the flo', let 'em swallow it and go.
Taking flights for a show, I tape all my chicks with snow.
I'm no Mr. Rogers rapper, I'm raw with this fa sho.
Fuck insurance, a gat gotta come with my car.
Come out at night like a vampire, bats might jump out my car.
I kick my name out your mouth, then start stomping your jaw.
If you looking for 50/50 black, come to that Nawf.
