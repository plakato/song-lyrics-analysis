Gettin' Hot Live Lyrics
by The Runaways.

With every beat of my heart its getting dark.
There's something in the air.
The doors aren't locked, you know it's not.
But I just know you're somewhere.
Hands on the table, are they empty got a fable.
Is it true?
Say he's coming no one said a word.
They've gotten through.
Its such a crush, its getting hot.
Temperature's rising it's getting hot.
Shot a single word for telling true.
I can hear him pant.
I wanna leave but I just can't breathe free.
If they begin their chant.
Its such a crush, its getting hot.
Temperature's rising it's getting hot.
Church is breaking my body's shaking.
I just can't tell.
He's coming back my head is black.
He must be under a spell.
Its such a crush, its getting hot.
Temperature's rising it's getting hot.
