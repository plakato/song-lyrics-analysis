Welt Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


With the ground uncovered, with the leaves all gone.
I can see your face and I know I was wrong.
When I left you there, I didn't know who I'd been.
So I waited for the rain to wash off all my sins.
Running through the forest when the leaves would fall.
Back then I didn't have you and I thought I had it all.
Back then you wouldn't touch me unless I was in pain.
Now you're gone forever and the memories replay.
All the bricks in the tunnel won't stop calling me back.
Just like every single letter always fades to black.
Cut my own skin breaking all the clocks for you.
Can't turn back time but I can see what I could do.

How could you leave me here like that?
How could go away like that?
How could you go and you're gone forever?
Now you're just a memory that I can't sever.
How could you leave me here like?

With the ground uncovered, with the leaves all gone.
I can see your face and I know I was wrong.
When I left you there, I didn't know who I'd been.
So I waited for the rain to wash off all my sins.
Looking at the sky waiting for rain to fall.
When I'm under the trees, oh I feel so small.
When I left you to die, I didn't think it through.
Please understand I would do anything for you.
