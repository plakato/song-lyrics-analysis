Prince of Nothing Charming Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.


Here comes the part where you say I don't understand you, yeah.
And all those little things I never get right.
You talk and talk but all that chit chat's stuck in lipstick.
And it's driving me crazy, baby.

And I got nothin' when you smile like Mona Lisa.
â€˜Cause I need ya, I need ya tonight.
If walls could talk I'd be the Prince of Nothing Charming.
And it's driving you crazy, baby.

Oh you love like you wanted to fight.
Like you needed tonight.
Baby it's beautiful.
Oh and you scream like a gun in the night.
Yeah you're starting a fight.
It's like you don't know.
Baby you're beautiful.
Baby you're beautiful.

It's ten to midnight and this cheap champagne is wearing off.
She's tearing off her dress.
God I'm such a mess.
And in the dark she's taking shots at my heart.
She's got it to an art.
And this how I fall apart.

Oh you love like you wanted to fight.
Like you needed tonight.
Baby it's beautiful.
Oh and you scream like a gun in the night.
Yeah you're starting a fight.
It's like you don't know.
Baby you're beautiful.

Girl you got soul.
And I don't mind that you go.
A little crazy.
It's that passion I dig baby, yeah.
The world wants your glow.
But you're the last one to know.

Baby you're beautiful.

Here comes the part where only you can understand me.
Like cigarettes and candy.
Baby.
Baby.

Oh you love like you wanted to fight.
Like you needed tonight.
Baby it's beautiful.
Oh and you scream like a gun in the night.
Yeah you're starting a fight.
It's like you don't know.
Baby you're beautiful.
Baby you're beautiful.
Baby you're beautiful.
You're beautiful.

It's ten to midnight and this cheap champagne is wearing off.
It's time that I confess.
God I'm such a mess.
