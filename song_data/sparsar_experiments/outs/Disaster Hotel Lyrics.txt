Disaster Hotel Lyrics
by Russ Moshavi Chara.

This is a fine hotel.
I think it fits me well.
Now ima chill by the pool with the entourage.

Until the sky turns red.
And something makes you dead.
And I realize it ain't no marrage.

I don't get this thing they call a hotel.
Call it the motel from hell.
Because the first name just don't fit well.
And It's just so hard to tell.
Got a vicious cycle going of a rapper that is flowing and you know I don't be.
showing because I'm known well for just knowing.

Disaster hotel.

Catastrophe.

It's uncouth.

It's fucking blasphemy.

It ain't okay.

It ain't right.

It wakes you up inside the dead of the night.

We be driving pedal to the metal when we SCREECH!!!
See some ISIS coming down the block and Screech!
Shoot them jihadis with a Glock then we SCRRECH.
ISIS be chasing after us no way we gonna stop.

I swear, killing terrorists be an American hobby.
The only thing we enjoy more is shooting them with a tommy.
Old jihadists screaming, they hope they be seeing things.
My money is being stolen by the Bishop of bling.

Disaster hotel.

Catastrophe.

It's uncouth.

It's fucking blasphemy.

It ain't okay.

It ain't right.

It wakes you up inside the dead of the night.

We're watching TV when some breaking news appears.
The rioters be coming and it say business beware.
Machine gun guarded business and we don't give a fuck.
Sadly just like we walked through Fallujah with our guns up.

And no I don't give a fuck about Climate change.
I already give fucks about all else that is deranged.
When you talk about this Pseudoscience you know it be strange.
I am going nuts because it's fucking insane.

I'm still going and I ain't done yet.
It turns out that you just took another ho to bed.
Now a new AIDS pandemic gonna come and kill us all.
The disease rises sky high and the fucking humans fall.

Crime rates are rising in my neighborhood today.
Those motherfucking tramps can all get outta my way.
If you come try and rob me I will run you the fuck over.
You better hope if you see me you got a 4 leaf clover.

And the gays say if I don't support their marriage I hate.
Too bad mate, but I guess it be too late.
I explain that I do not hate gays but I think this court case blows.
I ask them to let us vote, but they still say NO!
And no you stupid shit I ain't a racist.
Unlike a bigot like you I still be going places.
When I see you on TV and lean over and *Blech!!!!*.
I see you on the internet and just say Oh flek.

I fucking hate environmentalists I slap em in the face.
I like to drive and SUV and do it.
I'll run your green asses over if you don't move away.
You voted down job creation, it's time to make you pay.

Yesterday a spoiled rich brat kicked be out on the street.
I did a stupid thing and I turned the other cheek.
It's true that I care 'll wish him well.
Yeah I'll be laughing my ass off when he's burning in hell.

A jehovas witness tossed a bible in my face.
I took one look at him and said You're really a disgrace.
I chased him down the street and rammed my foot up his asshole.
I flipped him upside down cause that's what I do to all trolls.

I fucking hate this Barney shit, turn the crap off.
Before I shoot the Tv set with a kolachenikov.
Barney the dinosaur, chasing a kid with a knife.
Police tackle the bastard in the suit, nighty night.

Disaster hotel.

Catastrophe.

It's uncouth.

It's fucking blasphemy.

It ain't okay.

It ain't right.

It wakes you up inside the dead of the night.

Nighty night nighty night nighty night nighty night.
It wakes you up inside the dead of the night.
Nighty night nighty night nighty night nighty night.
It wakes you up inside the dead of the night.
Nighty night nighty night nighty night nighty night.
It wakes you up inside the dead of the night.
Nighty night nighty night nighty night nighty night.
It wakes you up inside the dead of the night.
