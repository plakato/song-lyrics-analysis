Synplicity Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

Anybody Killa 
Is my mind, explicit cause. I hang with a sinner 
Hand in hand with the Hatchet, but it's nothin' familiar 
Non believers keep walking till we finally arrive. 
Black smoke around the family with the red in our eyes, 
Cold chills from the death holding onto the past 
With a pistol to the temple, cause your life movin' fast 
Devastated by the anger that you need to escape 
Right hand on the book. Flip the page choose your fate: 
 
Syn 
Kiss the dead on the red moon night. 
Will, they cry well. I think they just might 
Torturing. What'S a frozen, tear 
This ain't hell, but I'd rather be there. 
Spiderweb makes it hard to move 
Death awaits. Yet. I have nothing to prove 
Twisted soul. In my mental game. 
Murder comes and goes with no kind of blame. 
 
Syn 
Power drains as the dark becomes light. 
Trapped motionless cause the chords are too tight. 
What will ever become of this book that I hold 
Will. The fire burn us like they told Synplicity, 
 
Jamie, Madrox 
Rain drops fall from the dark night sky, 
Bodies crawl from garbage cans and alley ways alike. 
You can find me there in the shadows. Without a doubt, 
Time for my people and me to come about 
Children of the river and the misunderstood, 
Downtrodden and forgotten, but still it's all good 
Now. What you throw away is ours to keep 
You know the children need a pillow when they go to fuckin' sleep. 
 
Syn 
Your disease. It'S quite infectious 
Once. I know you're the object of my lust 
Acid rain come on and stick out your tongue 
There's enough for each and every single one 
Right or left c-c-come. Follow me. 
Pyramids l-lobotomy is necessary. 
Crystal ball! It'S just Synplicity, 
Kings and queens just show us where we should be you motherfuckers 
, 
Syn 
Power drains as the dark becomes light. 
Trapped motionless cause. The chords are too tight. 
What will ever become of this book that I hold 
Will. The fire burn us, like they told Synplicity 
 
Blaze Ya, Dead, Homie 
I was runnin' with a Hatchet down the block. 
My leg got popped when I copped a dub at the dope spot 
Everybody out to get me everywhere. I go 
Is it a sin. To get your dick sucked by a ho fuck, no 
What about the fact that I bring the dope guns, 
Stay outta my way and don't make me have to use one 
Can't help the feeling my head overloads, 
Pull the trigger and unload 
 
Syn 
Power drains. As the dark becomes light, 
Trapped motionless cause, the chords are too tight. 
What will ever become of this book that I hold 
Will. The fire burn us like they told Synplicity
