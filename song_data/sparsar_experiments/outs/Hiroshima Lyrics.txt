Hiroshima Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

Violent J.
Dog, you're gonna get fuckin' busted.
She'll break out with DNA on that ass.
She'll fuckin' use forensic science.
Whatever it takes, you ain't' getting away with it.
You're gonna get fuckin' busted, I'm fuckin' telling ya.

Syn.
Only sixteen, a hottie across the street.
Washing her daddy's car, she was toying with me.
She came inside and promised wouldn't take long.
She's about to swallow when my lady came home and caught me.

Syn.
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes.
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima.
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes.
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima.

Shaggy 2 Dope.
She was bitchin' mad out of control, like Hiroshima.
I thought the bitch was gonna explode, like Hiroshima.

Syn.
I never smoke, my woman hates it, it's wrong.
But this ganja, Mike Peezy had, it just smelt so strong.
Roll it up, fuck it, I puffed it and passed.
Not knowing my woman was standing right behind my ass.
Ng right behind my ass, oh lord.

Syn.
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes.
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima.
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes.
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima.

Shaggy 2 Dope.
The bitch was stompin', shakin' the flo', like Hiroshima.
I swear to God I couldn't take it no mo', like Hiroshima.

Syn.
I love this woman just as much as one can.
Some things I do, she will never understand.
I love Dark Lotus, and she loves The Cure.
I love my wrestling, and she says it's absurd.
She disses my style , she disses my rap.
She makes my dick hard when she sits on my lap.
If she dissed my homies, I guarantee you some drama.
I'll pack that bitch's shit up, send her back to her mama.

Syn.
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes.
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima.
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes.
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima.

Syn.
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes.
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima.
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes.
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima.
