Hold It Inside Lyrics
by Russian Red.

I'm not taking, I'm not, I'm not fading.
I'm not falling, you're not, you're not falling.
Cause you just hold it inside, you hold it inside?

I'm not feeling I'm not, I'm not a missed ring.
I'm just falling things that aren't the hole that's been your life.
The hole that's been their arm.

And all your voices and all, and all your choices.
And all my mechanisms to forget, forget you?

All inside I'm not, I'm not finding lies against this.
Whole established order that I found.
Inside your little heart, where I don't fit.
You don't fit, we both don't fit.
Nobody fits in there?

I'm just fading away?
Hold it inside.
