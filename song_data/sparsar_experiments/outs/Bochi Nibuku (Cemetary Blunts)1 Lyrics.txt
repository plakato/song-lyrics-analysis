Bochi Nibuku (Cemetary Blunts)1 Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Got, a pack full of raps and a whole lot of dope to roll tonight 
Ima, take your bitch to the back to the back of the lac and hold her tight 
All the windows down riding round your side of town 
Tray full of the blunt ash, got A trunk stuffed with that fucking pounds, 
Riding round riding round Rain fall and its coming down. 
Pinky ring go bling bling, but my switchblade don't make a sound 
I'm swerving just serve it. These bitches call a good surgeon, 
Your girl say she nervous. So she pop a pill and she twerking 
She bad. I'M good find me swinging around my hood 
Rolling back woods back to back, don't get it misunderstood: x2, 

I'm rolling and smoking and smoking and rollingx8 

I'm sitting in a chair rolling up some weed 
I. Don'T give a fuck about what you need 
All I care about. Is me and me, and my W-E-E-D 
Come fuck with me, but don't fuck with me 
If. You touch me I'll turn ugly 
If. She ug-i-ly, then she hang with me 
Ima! Keep it real till. I D-I-E 
I'm posted with the Bones carcasses around my home 
Man. I like to be alone, I'm to real to be a clone. 
I ain't human nigga, move on before I remix your dome 
Airplane most stay on my phone Bitch. I won't ever answer my phone 

I'm rolling and smoking and smoking and rollingx8 
Bitch
