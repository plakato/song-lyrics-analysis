And I want to knack your figure eight.

The truth is.
You must be lying.
If you say you don't know me.
And everybody know that I flow sick.
So I can give it to you lowkey.
And I can keep you happy.
Baby no frown.
I'm feeling like Naeto right now.
Cause I swear it's about to go down.

So I say give it to me.
Give it to me.
