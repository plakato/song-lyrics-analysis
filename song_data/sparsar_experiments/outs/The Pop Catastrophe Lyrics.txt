The Pop Catastrophe Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

He's a pop catastrophe.
From a strange factory.
He's created to succeed.
You'll be sedated by the beat.

Listen.
To the synthesizer.
It's attached to his waist.
With speakers in his chest.
His heart plays a song.
His heart plays a song.
His heart plays a song.
His heart plays....

He's a pop catastrophe.
From a strange factory.
He's created to succeed.
You'll be sedated by the beat.

But something went wrong.
Yeah something went wrong.
His mood writes the songs.
His mood writes the songs.
Some are sad.
But most are sour.
He has no control.
He has no power.
He has no power.
He has no power.
He has no power.

Cause he's a pop catastrophe.
From a strange factory.
He's created to succeed.
You'll be sedated by the beat.

You'll be sedated by the beat.
