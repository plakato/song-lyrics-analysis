Materealistic Lyrics
by Quiet Desperado.

I'm not fucking hip, I need a replacement.
Not this weird kid locked up in my brain's basement.
That's what fear did, ambition turns complacent.
That's what peered in, and where all the years went.
Because we especially can't express.
What we do and say in jest.
Waiting in line to confess.
That we've all become obsessed.
With the best and worst dressed.
I needed it off my chest.
Because life is a test that none of us pass.
We just go from class to class.
With all of it moving fast.
But we talk trash and rehash shit from the past.
When we don't see that each glimpse could be our last.

Oh bitch, where is he?
Check the obituary.
Falling into fiction like the Tooth Fairy.
Your teeth are fallen out, yeah that's a normal dream.
Nigerian King callin out, that's a normal scheme.
It may seem like we are deemed to be seen.
As obscene teens idolizing Charlie Sheen.
Fiending for anything green if you know what I mean.
