Firmament Lyrics
by Wolfgun.

There's a story of a wolf.
Who knew no enemy too fair.
He always minded to himself.
And never crossed the path of care.
But the world became his plight.
And that wolf put up a fight.
But now he's gone.
And no one can say.
No one can say to where.

Long ago, there was only darkness.
And in the darkness.
There was no light.
But the darkness could not remain forever.
Because there is no darkness.
Without light.

So you shall fear not.
Now is but a dream.
And in this dream.
The dreamer said.
Let there be light.
