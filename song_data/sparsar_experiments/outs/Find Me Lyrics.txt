Find Me Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.

Hey love, how ya holding up.
I know it's been a minute.
It's just me, so open up, come on open up.
I know that you don't think, that you're good enough.
But you're good enough.
So if we don't dream bout' the same things.
I better ask myself, damn.
Who am I, who am I, who am I.
And what am I, what am I gonna do.
I'd go to the ends of the fucking earth.

You can find me at the edge of the world.
You can find me if you open your heart.
You can find me when you're loving the stars.
You can find me when you're falling apart.
You can find me, yeah.

Hey kid, I know you been making plans with the devil.
And I hate to break it to ya, but he ain't your friend.
I know that you don't think.
That you're dope enough, that you're cool enough.
But I know we dream about the same things.
So ask yourself.
Who am I, who am I, who am I.
And what am I, what am I gonna do.
I'd go to the ends of the fucking earth.

Meet me in a dream.
I'll be that little voice inside your head.
You can find me.
At the edge of the world.
