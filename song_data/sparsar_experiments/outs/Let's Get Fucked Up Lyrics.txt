Let's Get Fucked Up Lyrics
by 57th Street Rogue Dog Villians.


Let'S get fucked up, 
Let's get high. Let'S get drunk 
Let's get fucked up. 
We got that weed that ain't no punk 
Let's get fucked up. 
Let'S get high. Let'S get drunk 
Let's get fucked up. 
Pumpin highlanders in the trunk, 
Let's get fucked up, 
 
BAKARII 
Nigga. This is Kansas City. 
You got me fucked up 
Highland and Shortnitty 
Nigga. We can knuckle up. 
I got fifty-six with me 
Strickly for my rouges 
With me. Until they lift me, 
We can meet for, shows, 
I see they lovin us 
So. Let the world know 
They. Hoes is fuckin us 
If, not they hoes go 
My villians and me yellin 
We relish until we perish 
Original rock wellers, 
My niggas and me releasin 
Bone and CD's 
With money, steady, increasin, 
For houlagans, like me, 
Money by all means 
Smokers gone pay for daytons 
Smokin on Collard greens, 
But mobbin off in a eighty 
56th and highland 
Livin, and never dieing, 
Young heartless tyrants,

Don't wan na upchuck 
Open a window. I need some wind 
Now, I'm on the floor.

Too drunk to drive home

Set the glass on the dasher 
Paw prints on my gage 
So, much money to be made. 
Let'S all get paid. 
Get, the cluch of red spaids,

Hungry hungry, eat, em up

Tryna find some hoes to fuck 
Man. I want my johnson sucked 
Bakarii's puffin on the blunt 
While. I'M steady, gettin, drunk 
As. We swerve off in the burbs 
Rimmy got my hoppin curves 
Now, I'm smashin to the land. 
Fifty-Six is where I'm in 
Now my heaters close at hand 
Heard these haters makin plans. 
Tryna get me for my grands 
It's the world of Short-Nitty 
Now. I got my villians with me: 
On the corner countin, my scrill 
On, a mission around the balls 
Got to pick up one more dog 
He's over from Ike's up from Paul's

Y'all done heard him on them records 
And. He gets them bitches naked 
Man. Let me hit it for a second

And the know what I want to do.

Get em', all of CariBuLoom

Bitches know that we hogs 
So, they dress like hoes. 
They can come without them. Draws

Hoes straight star, struck

Yah drunk yet Yah high, yet
