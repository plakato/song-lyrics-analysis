I don't care [radio mix] Lyrics
by Xperience.

You told me it's a dream to be.
The one who spends the night with me.
We made love till the morninglight.
And you did everything just right.
I don't care if you love me.
Cause I don't love you anymore.
I don't care if you need me.
I know it can't be good for me.
The love left at the break of dawn.
While you were sleeping, sleeping on.
I wrote a letter on the floor.
Cause I don't love you anymore.
I don't care if you love me.
Cause I don't love you anymore.
I don't care if you need me.
I know it can't be good for me.
I don't care if you love.
Cause I don't love you.
Anymore.
I don't care if you love me.
Cause I don't love you anymore.
I don't care if you need me.
I know it can't be good for me.
It can't be good for me.
