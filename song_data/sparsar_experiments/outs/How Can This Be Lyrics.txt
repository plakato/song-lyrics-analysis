How Can This Be Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.


Ever since we were kids the love we had was real.
Everything that we did we let each other know the deal.
When we would walk to school we had each other's back.
We were inseparable and strength where we would lack.
B-section:.
On that day when they called and let me know the news.
I began to cry tears for you.
Even though the time we shared is a time that I will miss.
But there's an emptiness of the bliss that once existed.

How can I tell her that I love her if she doesn't know me.
How can I tell her what she means if she cannot dream.
How can I show her that she's beautiful if she cannot see me.
How does she know she makes me cry if she's not alive.

I remember people saying give them their flowers.
While they yet live so they can see them.
But you never think that day could ever come to hit you.
Because the love you had was strong and invincible.
B-section:.
But remember God is the creator.
And he has the power to shake her and take her.
Even though the time we shared is a time that I will miss.
There's an emptiness of the bliss that once existed.

Though I get lonely I know she's with me.
Cause death can't take my special lady from me.
God guide me along in Your will.
Cause I know Heaven is real.
