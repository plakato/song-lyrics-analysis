Payin Bills Lyrics

“Paying Bills” by Unified Giants, 
 
I'm, feeling better main 
I hope so 
A whole lot, better 
You, better start tweeting 
I'm feeling like I'm on a whole other level, main 
You, better step your game up, 
KEI-SHON-SON…, KEI-SHON-SON, 
Worldwide 
And! Still, you got to say you got to say: 
Wo, wo, wo, worldwide, 
Yeah, 
, 
I'm, steady hanging with them squares and them nerds 
So disregard every single thing you heard 
They holler run away slave. How did you get away 
How? Did you get away run away slave 
Well me and master clashed 
I grabbed that whip back 
That's, how I did that… certified beast mode: 
Down many dirt roads, 
Where sneakers, lose souls 
Never to return just to be thrown away. 
And. Yet, and still I bare the cross. 
To live to see another day…, hey 
That's, how I'm feeling now 
I need them. Bills paid 
To, go and get it now. 
Yet I've been at it…. That'S how I'm living now 
And some, how the piles of money might elude me 
And having things while being broke. 
Just, don't sooth me 
So, get real and live your life like a movie 
 
I'm working hard, ya'll 
Trynna' stack it up, 
Spend that eat that pour it up, 
Its, good money and I'll. Never ever get enough 
Until. We got enough…, I'm never giving up 
 
And! Yet, and still we paying bills 
On bills on bills, on top of bills, 
More bills on bills, on top of bills, 
With some other bills, I'm talking big bills, 
 
I, keep my eyes wide open, 
I'd, rather see than be seen, while good with everybody. 
We got to get along cannot mess the money up, 
A great sense of humor. Rarely on that funny stuff, 
Moronic oxy break it down and roll it up. 
The key to hard work is really just showing up 
I sound smart, but I really don't know enough. 
I'M headed to that new world follow us 
Where them. Blunts are shared and models swallow us 
So. Why lie when? It really is the truth, though 
And then I feel it. Every time I hit the both yo 
I'm sporting old cloths, coming with some new flows. 
And then, I cook that on a Viking stove, 
Pan seared and I'm talking, life… life, 
While them angels stand right, here… 
I, showing love for the world, but I lack fear 
 
I'm working hard, ya'll 
Trynna' stack it up, 
Spend that eat that pour it up. 
Its, good money and I'll never ever get enough 
Until we got enough…, I'm never giving up 
 
And yet and still we paying bills, 
On bills on bills, on top of bills, 
More bills on bills, on top of bills, 
With some other bills, I'm talking big bills, 
 
I'm working hard, ya'll 
Trynna' stack it up, 
Spend that eat that pour it up, 
Its, good money and I'll. Never ever get enough 
Until we got enough…, I'm never giving up 
 
And yet and still we paying bills 
On bills on bills, on top of bills. 
More bills on bills, on top of bills, 
With some other bills; I'm talking big bills, 
 
Stack it up; 
Pour it up; 
Yeah yeah, yeah, 
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh…, 
Uh-huh, yeah
