Ego Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.


I used to think humility was everything.
The only way through to ourselves.

I fall against the ego.
I fought, fear brought me closer to the truth.
I fall against the ego.
I knew it brought me closer to losin'.

From first step to last.
I'm rising from the ashes.
From first step to last.
I'm tender to you.

I used to think that I was bound to reverence.
The only way through to my hell.

I fell into the ego.
I feel, it brought me closer to my youth.
I fell into the ego.
I knew it brought me closer to hubris.

From first step to last.
I'm rising from the ashes.
From first step to last.
I'm tender to you.
