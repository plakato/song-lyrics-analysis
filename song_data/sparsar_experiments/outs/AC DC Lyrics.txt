AC DC Lyrics
by Sweet.

She got girls.
Girls all over the world.
She got men.
Every now and then.
But she can't make up her mind.
On just how to fill her time.
But the only way she can unwind.

A.C. D.C.
She's got some other lover as well as me.
A.C. D.C.
She's got some other women as well as me.
She's got some other women as well as me.
She's got funk.
But they call her a punk.
She got zing.
You ought'a see her dingaling.
Well let's be in it together.
Cause she'll be in it forever.
You've got to take it now or never.

A.C. D.C.
She's got some other woman as well as me.
A.C. D.C.
Some other woman as well as me.
A.C. D.C.
Some other woman as well as me....
