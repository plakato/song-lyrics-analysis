In-Touch Lyrics
by [UNDEFINED].

In-Touch 
 
They bring me up and then they shoot me back down 
I'm wondering if I can ever come back now, 
I'm searching man, I'm looking all around. How could they ever do this to me? 
I won't never score. No, I ain't ever gon na touch down. 
They said man, you got a really raw sound.. I think that you should get the
crown 
Because, your rhymes make people's heads bounce 
I've almost got it down, but I'm still circling around and I haven't given up
yet 
This game is tough and I'm working up a good, sweat Jet set. 
Just. Give me all your eyes and ears and pay attention to the way it appears 
or. How it's mentioned. 
They say it shouldn't, wouldn't it couldn't ever be done 
And, if that's your thinking., It shows why you ain't number one 
Now I'mma love messing around with you. It'S gon na have to be a lot of fun. 
Undefined number 1 
 
You say that I won't make it 
And. It'S gon na be hard to fake it. 
Well guess who's gon na make it 
It's me. I'M gon na take it. 
 
Dadadadadump dah dadadadadump dah 
My head is racing dadadadadump, dah, 
They're, so confusing they say they want a hurrah 
So. I give them what they want and then I get shoved off 
If only they could keep to their decision 
Instead of making it like a fender collision. What an insicion, 
At least it's not me cause. I keep my presicion 
But, it's hidden deep inside of my vision. 
I started out in the 209 of Stockton till my neighbors wife got beat and
clocked, then 
We moved to the 530 in tahoe cause. My moms didn't want to soak in their own
sorrow 
That's. When I started to jott down some words 
About the way I felt the hurt and worse 
Getting it out was almost like a nurse healing all the wounds and nerves
