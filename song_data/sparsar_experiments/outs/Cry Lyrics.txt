Cry Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


Oh oh oh ohhhhh oh.
Oh oh oh noooo ooo.
Woahhhhhh.

Have you ever had a problem you had to keep to yourself.
And you're tryingm but it hurts like hell.
It's a feeling I despise.
Bringing misery to life.
Wishing you had someone to trust in.
So you can let it all out.
Convey the reason you been feeling so down.
But when you reach out for help.
You find there's no one but yourself.
I know....

Life won't be this tough forever.
Only one thing makes it better.
Don't hold it inside.
No such thing as cry.
When your heart's on the line.
It's okay to cry.

I know what your feelin, I've been through it myself.
Contained emotions I was locked in a shell.
Little did I know I was headed down that road.
I never had a compass directing where I should go.
Make a left off victim road.
Continue straight into the light.
Because that's where you should find help.

And we're never too old.
Or too grown to just cry.
Said you gotta let it out sometime.
Sit in a corner and cry.
Hug on a pillow and cry.
Scream to the top of your lungs and just cry.
