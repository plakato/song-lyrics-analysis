F#A#$ Lyrics
by United Nations.

...crushing sense of post-industrial poverty... commerical disenchantment ....
night of the living Dead Flag Blues....
When we found out that the car on fire was just another product.
And the driver, asleep at the wheel.
Was on AmbienTM it hurt like hell....
But we opened our wallets up.
And they were full of money!
Now we're too worn out.
To sing the Dead Flag Blues.
With every marching step.
Another build-up.
Leading us to nowhere.

...dreams blow out over the canyons at Rio Marañón... captive and blindfolded.
peaceful sleep....

... The Palliative Effects of Foreign Cinema on Late Stage Capitalist Collapse.

Now you know what it's like.
So get up off your bed.
Turn the record off.
Pretend that you're dead.
And turn the TV on.
You're nothing but a foreign film.
A distraction from reactions.
I can't hear you, I can't feel you.
But I can see you, I can see you.
I can see you.
Like a dollar sign.
Neon light on highway drive.

It's a needle, a cathedral.
With a steeple.
But no people.
I can see you.
I can see you.
I can see you.
I can see you looking back.

I haven't even got a mind that's that inhumane.
