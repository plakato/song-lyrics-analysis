A Dance With The Devil Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


Mmmm.
Give it to em.
Imma give it to em.

And I was thinking about you....
When I saw that ass walk past, I almost had to act a fool.
When I get that thing up unda the sheets up in the hotel room....
By the way she look at me, I know she wants to fuck me too....
And that's real.
And I was thinking about you....
When I saw that ass walk past, I almost had to act a fool.
When I get that thing up unda the sheets up in the hotel room....
By the way she look at me, I know she wants to fuck me too....
And that's real....

Sippin Henny, smokin on weed.
And I don't wanna get in trouble? 'for the bitches show up.
Three bad ones on me?
An automatic, I was on em when I made em go nuts.
And she's a fiend for the long meat.
And knowin ? I had to hit her with the ?
I hit her with the ?
And now ya knowin that my flow is sick.
And now ya knowin that a nigga never lovin the bitch.
I'm Twisted Insane, that? awesome shit.
Motherfuckers that run up, then you'll? get done on? so quick.
My cycle's? ? to bend you over the kitchen counter and put it all up in ya.
though.
? when I? benefit but they don't ever gangsta though.
Hoppin on the doobie and the dough?
? so I hit em with the ski scope?
Cuz I was only in it for the dough.
And I was always thinkin ?
? wake up, drink ? money to rain.
And put the body in a ? with a little bit of shoo shoo shoo.
?
And havin a gang of bitches up on my face, ?, spittin my loogie right on top.
of they booty.
She say I didn't, but I got it on tape.
And she was out and finger fuckin? ? nigga but truly.
Infatuated with the... BIG TITS!
And naked booty that she use to bring up ovah my house, ?
I used to wonder how the bitch ? with dick in her mouth.

And I was only lookin at you thinkin in my mind....
That I really wanna get behind you cuz I go and smash it every time a nigga.
hit it from behind.
? lookin at me like you really wanna know my name....
Winkin at me so I thought you was authentic?, had to ? my thing.
And that's reeaal.
