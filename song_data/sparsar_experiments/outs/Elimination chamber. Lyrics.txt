Elimination chamber. Lyrics
by Sweats..


Sorry to startle it's just that I talk smarter cause 
Niggas out here, drier than nigger hair after saltwater 
I'm at a period where I'm leery delirious I'm 
Still, teetering on. If I should take this shit, serious- 
Ly bruce off a gallon of jungle. Juice, proceed to 
Watch me get loose and spread like a mothers, cooch the bread 
Giving me a boost of effort, 
these niggas, dessert, how
am 
I, a better writer when all I use is my left. Huh 
Young, dastardly, regurgitating battered dreams. These 
Niggas shellshocked cause I'm actually spitting casualties, 
But, there's more to cry. 
And careers there's more to die. I 
Rip and rig b's, like my fucking name, was mordecai 
The critics backing off 
now girls wan na jack me off 
Miyagi on these papis tryna. Stop me just wax em' off 
I'm craving rappers, so I'mma catch and lock em' up you 
Bore us y'all, niggas' raps poorer than some noxzema 
 
Extra ordinary on my dexter, morgan very 
Coarse. Look another fucking corpse to the morgue to carry 
Young bashful sweats king of the castle got 
Me an ass full after some drug-induced hassle 
Smooth as silk. When I step in the john wilkes and treat the 
Beat like abe lincoln, like the fuck, was che thinkin and 
Fuck, your raps'bout inking and ballcaps from you, 
Corny mall rats, y'all can
hold, my ballsack and all 
'latt, I'm that good 
shitting on these whack hoods catch me 
In some backwoods smoking on some dallas backwards. 
Nigga you absurd your
heiress wan na cherish 
telling 
Me, her pussy's hairless, when sweats could really care less 
These, niggas, dumb and dumb they're. Looking like a lunch for some 
Careers vegetative cause, their raps are just cucumbersome. 
Here'S advice go mimic a strike swiftly. 
Or, you might just be the next. I put six deep
