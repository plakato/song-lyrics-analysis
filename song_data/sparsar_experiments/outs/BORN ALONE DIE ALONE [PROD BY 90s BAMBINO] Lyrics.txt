BORN ALONE DIE ALONE [PROD BY 90s BAMBINO] Lyrics
by Black Kray.


How many niggas gonna cry for me.
Niggas say they love me, but ain't gon die for me.
How many niggas gonna ride for me.
Smokin on this kush cause ima die alone, sittin on tha throne.

How many niggas gonna cry for me.

I be shining nigga smoking on this mid dro.
Dirt road boy pullin thick hoes.
New shoes, told her watch my kicks ho.
Early morning I be eating all kix tho.
Princess gucci Glock icy pistols.
Riding by my side can't trust my bitch tho.
Hit my iphone and hit my flip phone.
Riding in that jeep with the doors off.
Dirt road country boys knock your doors off.
Big ass hands knock your block off.
? 15 Gucci clear knock your wig off.
Gold slugs in my mouth color crystal.
Young nigga tryna shine for my mom dog.
Black cloud ???????? cause its our drop dog.
Hundred mill and our trap ? cause its our job dog.
Lil money girl she got lockjaw.
? fours up, nigga hangin out the sun roof.
Let the sun shine on my Gucci crib boo.

How many niggas gonna cry for me.
Niggas say they love me, but ain't gon die for me.
How many niggas gonna ride for me.
Smokin on this kush cause ima die alone, sittin on tha throne.
