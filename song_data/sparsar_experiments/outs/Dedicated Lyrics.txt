Dedicated Lyrics
by Wonderstarz.


Now life has brought us to an end. 
But still can't contend 
Oh. My lady friend 
You were here now you ain't 
So. Now I comprehend 
Whatever, I said in 7, wasn't the end: 
 
হারিয়ে যাওয়া পথে আমি হেঁটেছি 
হারিয়ে যাওয়া বুকে আমি তোমায় পেয়েছি 
জানিনা কিকরে বোঝাই তোমাকে 
আমি ভেবেছিলাম, তুমি, থাকবে, আমার, পাশে, চিরটাকাল, 
মৃত্যু-ই, আমাদের, ধ্বংশ, হওয়ার, কারণ, 
একবার, ভেবে, দেখেছ, আমার, লাগবে, কেমন, 
 
Fuck. It now she's gone. What can I do but remember all the sacrifices I
made for you. 
You might be capable of livin' without me, but I ain't sit around a second if
I ain't committed to you.. 
The best thing: that's ever happened to me: 
Can't believe it you're gone.. 
But, wake up Sap, it's true 
And! I don't deserve all the things. I'Ve got all along, 
I knew nothin' good ever lasts too 
The only thing I did was misunderstood. 
Thought, you were playin' me.. 
Not, a bad suggestion, as you were quite popular in skul 
Never thought: you'd fall for a thug like me, 
But those guys literally drooled over the thought of you. 
And I'll stand there.
