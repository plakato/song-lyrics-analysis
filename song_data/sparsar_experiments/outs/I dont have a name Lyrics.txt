I dont have a name Lyrics
by Yungchiefwillie.

You might be trying to diss but in fact you should be full of fright.
I wanted to give you a little time in the light.
But its time i show you a real lyrical fight.
You think your all cool cuz you think you can rhym.
But in fact when i was reading this i felt like it was a wast of my time.
Rhyms like these need to be put to rest.
Cuz your words dont even come close to the best.
