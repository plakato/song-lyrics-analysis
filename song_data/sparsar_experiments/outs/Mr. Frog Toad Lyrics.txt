Mr. Frog Toad Lyrics
by Tyler Major.


Hold, the noise --, let that boy rap 
He, could be the greatest emcee with a dunce crown thinking. Cap 
Drawing blanks, --, -- and saving face -- get the liquor straight 
Theres. Only one mic -- -in my hands its in the winners place. 
Dont blend my music with the damn mood, swings 
The plot rock spots: dap spock just get the ooze and leave 
Bagg em, please -- braggins for the swag role 
Endure. The lightest facets to reach the masses in the front row. 
The glow undeniable sweeter lyrics than papaya fruit, 
Whoever doubted, got the left and spoke with miley cyrus too 
\ --, it ain't a army or the navy, nor the drill team 
He said the boy could flow and leaked elixer like that filled spring 
Please..whose. The first on your fav-or-ite list, 
And got dissed by the straightedge with all the paperclips 
Who, never missed one scratch off at the dealerships. 
These stories begin with more twists and turns than what the swisha gets. 
 
Manipulated by his buddies and his hasbeens 
Take em out the mystery like. Where can we find those damn kids, 
The plot ain't thick enough to eat more mayo, 
The underground ain't, see him enough to shout free thebe and free yayo, 
He ain't buzzin..blame it on the corona lime, 
Told them. He'Ll live the life of a million man for the millionth time, 
\ --, -- -then after that get up 
Still standing at 5'10 wanting porckchops and to hiccup 
\ -- -- -- whats wrong. You seem troubled 
Am, I suppose, to move like billy goats on this stage. With my lyrics muffled 
And delivering 32 figbits of why im better than the next guy 
Im sorry, you bought your ticket in the wrong line. 
Cuz. This here is for the kids in ASP. 
That were the lasts. One picked up, -- -and never spoken to nobody. 
He watched the sun all recess with his imaginaries close 
Its, why his eyes are so bad. I dedicate this to mister frog, toad
