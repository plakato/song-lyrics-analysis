Dirty Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

I was driving that tractor, spittin my 'bakker.
Had some roads to hoe.
500 acres but my sweet potato kept blowin up my phone.
Said how much longer are ya gonna be.
Get your butt in gear.
Forget that shower I'll see ya in an hour.
Boys now listen here.

She likes a greasy ol ball cap.
Beer cans in the back.
Truck drivin kinda man.
Country in his roots n dust on his boots.
And hard working calloused hands.
Aw she she ain't worried.
For a girl so purty.
Aw she sure does like it...dirty.

Had reservations and a table waitin but she didn't wanna go.
Said she don't drink wine, rather sip shine and ride on ol back roads.
My buddy Dallas he got a cabin down on the riverside.
She said she ain't scared so I took her there and she took me for a ride!

kinda girl.
River bank rope swinger, eats her chicken with her fingers, hazard county.
queen when my pick up ain't clean.

No she ain't worried.
For a girl so purty.
Aw she sure does like it...dirty.

So I turned on the radio, played her something nice and slow, tried to get her.
in the mood.
She said she didn't wanna slow dance, two step or hold hands, you know what I.
wanna do.

I wanna roll down the windows, crank it 'til the speakers blow, by now you.
outta know.
Ya play me somethin' that a rocks, knocks me outta these flip flops, get some.
mud between my toes.

Oh I ain't worried, I might be purty but I sure do like it...dirty.

Ha ha ha.
She likes it dirty.
That's right.
She likes it dirty ya'll.
Straight up, dirty.
C'mon.
