Never A Day Lyrics
by Wood.

Don't go standin' there.
Blockin' my view.
And spoilin' my night.
You know why we're here.
She's an old flame.
I'm tryin' to lay.
And if beauty sleep.
Can really work.
She must of just woken up.
So rub your eyes.
Cause seein' is believin'.
Never a day goes by.
Without something.
Stopping me hard in my tracks.
I could be happy.
And I'll never know it.
Till never a day comes back.
If words alone sound cheap.
When I come around.
You'll wanna be out.
I want that window seat.
If I'm goin' down.
I wanna see out.
And she's happy now.
I'm goin' home.
Another day.
Another cruel reminder.
Never a day goes by.
Without something.
Stopping me hard in my tracks.
I could be happy.
And I'll never know it.
Till never a day comes back.
Never a day goes by.
Without something.
Stopping me hard in my tracks.
I could be happy.
And I'll never know it.
Till never a day comes back.
Could be a song on the radio.
Could be that feeling from long ago.
Could be that accidental photo I find.
When I'm lookin' for somethin' else.
But I found you.
Never a day goes by.
Without something.
Stopping me hard in my tracks.
I could be happy.
And I'll never know it.
Till never a day comes back.
Never a day goes by.
Without something.
Stopping me hard in my tracks.
I could be happy.
And I'll never know it.
