LOVEBITES Lyrics
by Qaewin.

Thesis

Seize my veins between your teeth
And rinse down with my name
I, see and smell blood
And. My bruises yellow
And, my Sun, is purple
Don't know how it sets there, where you are

Where, you are

BODY

Scatter half my ashes in the banks, where I sunk, 
The, other half by the banks of any capitalist fucks
It disappoints me when you claim you're, open minded and such
Packing and passing a Blunt, but won't even pass up a buck

Rappers distracted by ass. I want that passionate love
How. Many dads have been acting up yet they're smacking their sons, 
How many mothers been loyal lovers, but never recover 
How many sisters make it a mission to keep it in stitches. 

Don'T mean they're joking around and Richard Pryor to this brother whatever
umbrella you sit under ..., won't stop the reign of whatever God that you claim

If amnesty ran in the family and Allah's. The government 
Ball up crumble, the dotted line and then swallow the covenant
Swallow. My cum, if you don't get, I ain't kidding around

I'm in the Navy sinking. Isn'T allowed
These? Are my visions, mixed in with nostalgia
I, take a pic and photo finish? The album

I ain't on one, I'm Om one
Meditating in places where the warm sun could make my enemies feel an ominous
omniscient presence dark enough to turn a full Moon into a crescent
2 spoons. In my breakfast
So, you know what it is

I'm, still learning lessons
That's what excellence is
I'm still underrated, but know that Im much better than Them
I know my worth
I ain't waiting on professional bids

CONCLUSION
They think they know, but often sometimes never do
Frequency high. Nobody can alter my mood
Frequently. I just want to run into the woods
What's good
