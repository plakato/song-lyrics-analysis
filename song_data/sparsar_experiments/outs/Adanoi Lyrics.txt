Adanoi Lyrics
by The Wrens.

You ought to know.
That everyone is asleep inside a church.
It's a social setting let it erase.
Stick it to the skin take a spike.
Here's an eye hole through the wrists.
melech halom ba ray pre ha goffen adanoi.
Take all the doubts wear the ideas.
Call it a faith and it's the finest sunken show you're in.
I'll head the concept so kiss my behind.
I'll take you where you want to be my son.
Murray passed out five miles from the border.
