Yo Akala 
Knowledge is power. 
Volume 1 Mixtape 28th of may Listen, 
Akala, music.com 
Tiny bit more vocal. Please actually 
Listen Knowledge is power, always 
Listen, 
, 
Oi Mate, my personal life's great 
Some of you would love me more. If I rubbed that in you're face 
Okay well, 
Let us run down the resume and have a little chat about how Akalas living
today 
Big whip nice yard Been all over the globe. 
Look. How many continents I have done Shows 
Couple little company's Neat little office 
Everything, going swell Little bit of profit, 
Built a business, educating kids from the blocks. 
So far as I'm concerned, you got ta be a mug to not rate him 
Own. My masters Still my own master, 
Novels and scripts on the way. 
Rap is just a part of The genius and it's said 
And. He knows it Dickhead, Since I used to kick ball for West ham. 
With my bighead 
Back in school days wearing hand-me downs from my sister 
And gal', was still onto man Now thats some ras charisma, 
As, just a nippa I
took, my first pull of rizla 
And, who you think gave me that yeah my bigger sista 
So when we speak Of struggle cousin, it's yours, 
You know the same old madness, working class, poor 
Yeah, So may of won a couple awards. 
But. I guarantee my family's just as messed up as yours, 
All the abuse and the alcoholism and drug addiction. 
Uncles going to prison. 
This is working class livin' in Britain It ain't great 
You got ta, be kiddin' 
So, please don't ever get confused by me. Spittin' 
Cos'! Yes, I said the ghetto's in our head 
But. No, I didn't mean that if you live next to a food yard, that thats in your
dreams 
I meant believing in the madness they spout about us 
It's, far more dangerous than putting us in council houses. 
So yeah I criticize, but from a place of love, never ever 
Because. I think that I've become above 
Every young broth. You wan na judge as a tug' 
It's me minus a little guidance and love 
So. I think that your the mug 
And, why be smug when it's an actual fact 
We all commit crime Simply by paying tax 
Cos'? We then go and tickle the people in Iraq 
And ask them so politely for all their minerals. We extract 
We, blew children's heads off, Set fire to backs 
Were a gangsta nation get down or you get clapped so 
When. You see the yout' running around on the road with heaters. 
Don'T be surprised, they're just copying their leaders 
Long as the wars stay in places that are brown and poor. 
We can all pretend to be Abhorred, But we applaud 

The police man who duppies you will probably get knighted 
If. I don't wan na fight. You cuz' 
It ain't cos', I'm frightened 
It's, just rather fight with those who really think they're. Titans shit, 
I ain't, scared of bleeding 
I ain't scared of breathing another breath in this world, where everything is
so uneven, 
Where millions murdered in the Congo, and it's barely news 
But. If a footballers, wife should buy a pair of shoes 
I'm supposed to give a fuck, apparently I do not 
The worlds. A reflection of you're block 
And. If you think a world that profit from their death and be totally cool, 
And things should be better cos'. You live here, your a bloody fool, 
Look around the genocidal abuse, 
I swear; humanity, ain't, nothing, but a virus with shoes 
Then. I pick my nephew up from school and I look at the youths. 
And see the love that they show each other and I'm just so confused 
Because, they ain't learnt. Yet what is their race or religion? 
So we're put unconditioned, but we learn to play our position. 
In the system 
Look. What that does to our recognition of self 
We grow suspicion of our own intuition? Listen 
Akalas, sick, but he raps about racism to much 
Could you imagine. I gave a flying f 
Cos'! It'S amazing how many wan na claim they love this music 
With! No respect for the actual struggle that produced it, 
Did Hip-Hop not start in segregated hoods. Are them hoods, not still
segregated? 
So. It'S really good 
And, the first nation, not still on reservations where the age of 46 
Is, the average life expectation, 
And fellas. I wonder where the Favelas could be suddenly knocked down, 
And replaced with something better 
If, you got sense, you see, fights are joined in race, class and 
Gender are sides of the same coin. 
So, if you really down for justice, whoever the people who suffered whoever
you are 
I. Consider you, my sisters, brothers 
But, call it what it is like Carlin or Bill Hicks 
Not, these patronizing left-wing little twits, who ask me dumb shit, 
On the superior tip 
And wan na act like cos. I read: I saw less violence as a kid. 
Don'T make me an exception. 
For your mental protection, 
From acceptin', the madness in the system we are left in 
That was the clearest thing to come of august events 
All the closet, bigots started speaking their minds again 
So when a Jamaican or Asians misbehavin'. Of course, it's because of their skin 
Blonde hair kills a million people thats, just him 
And, it's entertaining some people are so thick 
But. I prefer that to all of the fake grins 
Cos', it's the only problem. People claim they wan na so but don't actually wanna
talk about 
How it evolved. You are told this country really really yours, sir 
What. They did to brown people, they did to their own poor first 
And. Originally in the states working class. Whites were also enslaved, 
Still. No one talks about it today, 
Ever since the master came with the system of privileged 

Cos', put the darkest blacks in the field. That mind is with us still: 
Billion dollar industry's skin cream and bleaching pills. 
And lets be honest. Most people of my complexion to this very day still think they're 
Better than the darker section 
You say it's changed, then only educate me about Wilberforce, not about the
Africans in Haiti. 
Who beat the army's of the British, Spanish and napoleon From the moment. It
Was stolen, 
From em. There was no controllin' em 
When, I was in school, she said, no, you never fought for freedom 
No. We freed you and you were on your knees, pleading 
And. Once more. Did you know that we kind of saved you from the barbarism of
Africa 
You should be grateful. 
And enough of our own people can't be bothered to read 
That. They actually believe that we were swinging from trees. 
They, don't know the kingdom of Congo had embassy's in Italy. 
500 years ago, Literally 
Ain't heard of Saint Maurice or Septimius Severus 
They ain't studying the past cos'. They think it's irrelevant. 
And attempts of pretending, ancient Egyptians, weren't African 
Nuttin', more than pseudo intellectual lies 
They. Obviously, ain't read what Aristotle Herodotus said: 
About people they saw for their own eyes and 
Egypt's been invaded since the fall of the pharaoh's 
Not, once Not twice, But many many times 
And. Nobody wants to explain why so many statues have missin' noses 
Even when those statues made of granite 
It ain't, one people alone, mis-taught about themselves. 
We live on Celtic land, But don't learn about the Celts. 
The same Irish people, you characterize as stupid, 
During the dark ages. Some of the most educated living in Europe 
And did you learn the numbers you count with every day, 
Were invented by Indian people. I bet you didn't 
Or how many million Indians fought for Britain in both world wars 
Still. You got the cheek to call them immigrants. 
We, don't learn about the Moors, of course, for some that knowledge, dangerous 
Is, it a problem, the impact they had on the Renaissance. 
When people take power over another group, 
We minimize their achievements, so we can make it feel true 
So. If you think Columbus was first to sail. Ocean blue 
You, probably believe Elvis created rock
