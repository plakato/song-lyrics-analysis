The Tower Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.


Over mellow month come through
Over. Temple turns blue too
Diaries. Turning, i feel them too
Tell him all those i drew
Ohhhhhhh

So many faces. I can't see
There are going things. I can't believe
But you stated of darkest magic
Its breakfast changing
Oh less for madness

In these lies and in the pains
When the stars become your truth. Whooooo

So many faces, i can't see
There are going things. I can't believe
I hear the tongues. Talk
Don'T tell me that i am alone
But deeply stated of darkest magic

Its breakfast changing
Oh less for madness
But. If you stayed the darkest magic
Its breakfast changing
Oh less for madness
I, hear the towns talk
Don't tell me. I am alone
I, hear the towns talk
Don't tell me. I am alone x2
Alone
Alone, alone
