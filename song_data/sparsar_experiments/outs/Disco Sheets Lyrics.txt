Disco Sheets Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

I saw a secret place.
Oh yes, show it to me again show me to.
Your secret place.
Oh yes, show it to me again, show it to me.
I know everybody's got something disgraceful.
Everybody, that's what the sake of…
It looks so pretty in the light—.
In the night's light.
Show it to me again, show it to me again.
Show it to me again, show it to me, oh.

I'm sorry about the dark…
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum bum…
I'm sorry about the dark…
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum bum…

You breathe.
Deeper than I do,.
I do..
He breathes.
Deeper than I do,.
I do..
I breathe shallow like I could've spied on spite.
One time I spied on you.

I'm sorry about the dark…
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum bum…
I'm sorry about the dark…
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum bum…

Everybody got their lid on tight.
Everybody says, Come with me.
I'm easy, and then we'll see who's got the secrets..
So if you're looking for romance I got answers.
Where the dancers evidently say, Come with me.
I'm easy, and we'll see who is the deepest..
And everybody got their hair just right.
And their lips just right, and their eyes say, Come with me.
I'm easy, and then we'll see who gots the secrets..
No one has to see, believe me.

Oh, I'm sorry about the dark…
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum bum…
