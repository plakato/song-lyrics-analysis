Writing On The Walls Lyrics
by Underoath.

Maybe we.
Why dont we.
Sit right here for half an hour.
We'll speak of what a waste I am.
And how we missed your beat again.
I swear we need to find some comfort in this run-down place.

And I'm short on time.
How come you try.
To place us all.
And fit the shape of.
And I break.
What they tell you.
You to move on, move on!
But mostly what they show you.
At this rate we can't give up.
I'm takin back all the things I've said.
I'm takin back all the things I've said.
But I sure can't just sit still.
Keep me filled in and I swear I'll come.
We walk alone.
We walk alone.
We walk alone.
We walk alone.
We walk alone.
We walk alone.
Back home.
Alone, back home.
You're almost gone and I'm okay.
I still see your shadow.
To give you time to be afraid.
But never your face again.
I remember your presence.
I hope to God you come down.
I hope to God you feel this now.
I hope to God you come down.
I hope to, God.
I know there must be some way out of here.
And all of them will be waiting there.
