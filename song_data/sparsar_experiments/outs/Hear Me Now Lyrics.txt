Hear Me Now Lyrics
by Tyler Joseph.


Oh yeah yeah.
Oh yeah yeah.
Oh yeah yeah.

Words of mine.
Words of yours.
Confusing rhymes.
And confusing wars.
Between words of love.
And words of hate.
Wars of dreams.
And wars of vain.

Once again I step inside my shoes.
A battle now for every single thing I do.
And I don't care because I don't have a clue.
I seem to close all the windows in my room.
That tell me how I am comfortable in silence.
This broken, tainted, skin that I'm in.
I can't win.
I need you to break me up,.
break me down to the sound.
So I can pray that somebody hears me now.
I just pray that someone hears me now.

There was a moment in my life.
Where I thought that you were gone.
And every moment of my life.
Was just printed fake.

I go to sleep every night.
I should be good at it by now.
But very lonely is tonight.
And time stands still.
So now I try to picture you with all the kingdom I can't find.
Fighting gravel, dirt, with this little mind.
I think I saw the kingdom.
Be in this feeling I must keep.
Walking close, crack the door.
And then I fall asleep.
Because every time I think I see your face.
It fades away.
And turns to gray.
Then I pray to save the day.
But anyway lets pray someone hears me now.

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Lets pray someone hears me now.
