What Am I Lyrics
by Von Grey.

What am I.
What are you.
I always change.
But thats alright.
So do you.
You were blessed.
Blessed with breath.
You are alive.
Your blood runs warm.
So does mine.
We need to open our eyes.
Look behind our unique disguises.
Well be together by and by.
BecauseWere all the same.
You made a bed for yourself.
Down on the floor.
Your bloods not warm anymore.
You won't walk away.
Until you see us crawl.
What do you do that for?
We need to open our eyes.
Look behind our brilliant disguises.
Well be together by and by.
BecauseWere all the same.
We need to open our eyes.
Look behind our different disguises.
Well be together by and by.
BecauseWere all the same.
