Black Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: In Triumph.
Black.
Are we going to where the morning never breaks.
Do we need to be afraid or hesitate.
Cause wherever I go, wherever this here man will go.
There´s no way but down, no way but down.
Wish I could see but all the lights are blinding me.
Wish I could see what has been and what will be.
Wish you could be my saviour.
Won´t you carry me across the line.
Can you heal me cause my broken body aches.
I trade yeah anything to make up for my mistakes.
Well give me something to ease the pain inside my soul.
Come on and black my sky, black my sky.
Wish I could see but all the lights are blinding me.
Wish I could see but all the lights are blinding me.
Wish you could be my saviour.
Won´t you carry me across the line.
Way up high in the silvery skies the ending of time I see.
Too late now, no solution at hand, no miracle man for me.
No miracle man for me.
Wish I could see.
What has been and what will be.
