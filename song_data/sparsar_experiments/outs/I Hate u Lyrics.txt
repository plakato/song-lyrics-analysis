I Hate u Lyrics
by 3rd Element.

I am idiotic.
I have no logic.
My mind was sold for fool's gold.
My soul was negotiated for insecurity in Heaven.

My greed crippled me.
I have nothing.
I thought I could love you.
I hate how you loved to make me hate myself.
I loved how you hated to make me love everything else.

I loved everything about everybody.
But I hate myself.
No one can love that.
I want to know how.

Should I hug my clone?
Kiss its arms?
Stroke its scars?
Tickle itself.
Put my arm on it.

What do I know?
I always play the shoulder to cry on.
But no one would lend me theirs.
So I cry on my own pillow.
It never judges because it never speaks.
It never harms me because it is immobile.

If she was alive and feminine, she would be my wife.
That's my shame.
My pride? What's that?
Swagger? Never heard of that?
Being real? What does that mean?

My personality speaks more than tongues that even Hebrews try to decipher.
I must be schizo, I don't know if I'm me or not.
My self-respect lost respect in myself.
My self-love never seemed to love myself.
I feel like Kendrick Lamar, i hate myself.
What happened to me, i and myself?
