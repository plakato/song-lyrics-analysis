KanYe West Excerpt.

Please curse me cause I strive for something better.
I'm done settling for less.
I want a bad bitch.
Maybe a tattoo of an owl on her chest.
When we together.
Know she fucking with the best.
All knowing.
Wisdom is in her fingertips.
But her nails are always painted.
Light make up.
But the eyeliner's wing tipped.
Under appreciated painting.
She steals men's souls.
At the promise of some gold.
Cause we all slaves to the same gains.
Same pains.
We growing not knowing.
How to achieve happiness.
But we all stuck in the same lanes.
We should complain.
Instead of comply.
Your words do offend.
If you try to imply.
That my words don't suspend.
What is believed as a conversation.
Art should be a medication.
Why should you spend all of your time.
To fill a regulation.
Of what's prescribed as success.
Fuck your goals.
I'm just trying to be the best.
Based off of.
What I know of myself.
I do it all by myself.
Cause I grew tired of waiting.
For somebody else's help.
So what I represent now.
Is for everyone ignoring me.
Fall asleep on the couch.
Waiting for my story.
See the desperation in my eyes.
I keep em on the prize.
While passion is rubbing my head.
Keeping the demons in disguise.

I'll take you away from this hunger.
I'll take you away from this pain.
Beware that I may take you under.
This is one ocean you can't tame.
Now you don't feel the pain inside your soul anymore.
I'll take you far away.
I'll push my passion till it's sold out.
I speak my heart and write my pain and all my soul out.
I'll never sail out.
I'll only sail out.
Onto the ocean.
To get lost I'll never bail out.

It's just me Sterling, Bam, Karim.
Standing in the middle.
With our backs to the center.
Cause we don't trust.
Anybody to come in between.
What we've established as our team.
Ain't break in the seams.
I keep having nightmares of my dreams.
I keep having nightmares of present day.
But I'm stuck back in school.
Nightmares that I'm swallowed by a tidal wave.
I see it coming but it crashes through the windows.
And you.
I see you running.
And you get away.
Like you secretly control the waves.
It never fails just can't make out your face.
And saltwater is all that I taste.
We can't be saved.
And I don't want to close my eyes no more.
Cause I'm afraid of the person that you take me for.
We can assume and pretend to not be fake no more.
But when you're alone with your thoughts.
There ain't no safety horn.
Like space they can't hear you scream.
Until it's took late.
That's just how it seems.
Just give me my fucking space.
So I can have my dreams.
And they're are golden.
With platinum seams.
But where's the silver lining.
If I'm controlled and consumed by my greed.
If beautiful women and music is all that I need.
When I close my eyes I can't control what I see.
Until my eyes refuse to open seeing permanently.

Kevin Smith Excerpt.

After the night in the bathroom stall.
You don't want to even answer my calls.
Unless you need some material gain.
Misusing who were to get to an ethereal plain.
It's plain to see you been abusing your influence.
Substance overusing.
Constant double d over viewing.
Trying to justify but never analyze.
Choosing a muse that could bruise the common.
Man's ego spilling the blues out.
Cruising on the past pain.
In the fast lane.
Becoming what you tried to prevent.
Yet you vent of consequence.
That gave you sense to never be there in the first place.
But that's the first taste.
And this the worst case.
After the ocean's tamed.
The choice is right in your face.
Will you grow and become the man.
Of which you're destined.
Or fall into temptation.
And watch the sea wash over your face.
