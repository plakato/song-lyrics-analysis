(Re)Introduction Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


I am back, 
It's been a while 
We on 
 
I'ma tell them. Like I told you, go fool, 
Follow your dreams. We never act like we're supposed to 
You. Gon', keep fronting, never be something 
I'm. A beast bumping Cheeze cruising in the street 
In a Deep humming, a song that you probably don't know 
Four deep out in Pungo. We never go slow 
Scooping up the ladies puffing trees in a four-door 
Popo creeping all up on us like a homo, no bro 
I. Don'T fuck with y'all catch me right above the law 
If I was hated. You would never hear from me at all 
We elevated my girl's hand out 
And I'ma get a little faded. We stand out, let's go 
 
 N-Debt
