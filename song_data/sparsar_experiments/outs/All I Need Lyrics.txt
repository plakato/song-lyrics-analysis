All I Need Lyrics
by X-Raided.

Bloccstar baby 
X-Raided, 
 
It's, so true 
All, I need, is a beat to flow to I'm old school 

Fuck Pro-Tools 
Let the flow show you how to capture my groove 
 
Give me a snare and a kick drum and I'm cool 
 
I'm, so smooth like suede Pumas in 86' 
When, it was all good 
Wasn't. Nobody on that shady shit, 
Nigga that ain't no Shady diss 
Don't, take it like some shady shit, 
I'm, just saying 
You get it twisted I'll. Give you more funk than some baby shit 
Back in 86. 
I was in Alabama with my poppa 
In Prichard on the outskirts of Mobile 
So, real 
Momma, tired of her son, getting suspended for getting kicked out of class 
Sent. My ass to my dad in a last 
Ditch effort to save me from the gutter 
But. I felt abandoned started not to love her 
Started, not to trust her 
Poppa wasn't the type to give a hug up. 
Or even say he love you 
He too busy selling drugs up 
What the fucks up. 
Sent me back to Cali. You don't want me here. 
Man I've been lonely here. 
Damn, it's been a lonely year, 
Besides God, my only fear is death. 
Well, that's not true. 
My only fear is the unknown. 
And nigga, I don't know you 
Staring in the mirror. Like Nigga, I don't know you 
Like alzheimer's 
I. Let my notebook provide a reminder: 
I reacquaint myself with myself 
And, wonder how it got so bad 
When. I got back to California summer 86' 
When my grandma had a massive heart attack. 
My momma saw what happened. 
I never got my momma back 
The trauma cracked. My momma heart broke her spirit 
Hope my momma 
Did. In my lyrics 
Love, you baby just to clear it from the table. 
Wash the plate. Watch the snake 
Don't, you cry, go wash you face. 
I can't blame you for my mistakes. 
You wasn't able to stop my case 
From happening. 
I know you prayed 
I'm, trapped, 
Within, the labyrinth of my conscience, 
And, I'm so afraid 
I'll never get to grow up and fade. 
With gray, hair 
And hold you close and stay there. 
When you go to praise 
God and Holy Ghost 
No. One knows how it feels. 
In, my own soul, 
Grim Reaper, embrace it's so cold. 
I'M, spinning out of control 
I need some help. 
Cause, even Jesus felt the burn. 
He said. Take this cup from me. I am death. 
You can't run from me I'll come for you 
If, you don't come for me 
It's ugly, but it's beautiful too. Just like a lie. 
Can be hideous but then be proven as true 
So fuck, a coupe fuck, a pretty girl 
You, get it 
It's a pretty world 
Be a globetrotter fuck, a city girl, 
You, get it 
Go to Harlem, go to Paris, go to Egypt, 
See the pyramids 
And know there Is ain't no reason 
To have fear to live 
Or. A reason to have your fear. Give your time 
A dime 
Or a damn. As a minority, 
I'm reporting, thee 
Shit. I see 
Recorded and storied thee. 
Validated authority 
As a king to keep it coming. 
I pour it on the track like porridge 
And. I pour it like syrup 
On, a pancake and I serve it. 
For a handshake 
So go on and admit man 
The man's great 
Look into my damn face. 
You can't deny it I'm. King of my damn state 
I can't shake the feeling. 
I was meant to be more 
And to see more 
Need to eat. More beats, rich 
C'mon feed me Seymour 
I'm in the lead. Ain'T no need to keep score, 
I'm never lead, but I glow 
I got my own aura homie. You can keep yours 
You want war, we devour your soul from your body. 
Like a scissor 
I, see you're in fear cause. I can eat your 
Lyrics. Then I leave more 
Lyrics on the beat for 
People too appreciate me for 
Follow me, the leader 
See, what they hate me for 
Cause. They can't do it like X, 
I am thee. Lord 
They tell you, they don't like X, 
But in private. They listen and they bite X, 
God bear witness, as I write this 
He's right here. 
In present tense he's right here. 
Why, you think all that light there 
I'm shining, I'm grinding 
I'm ahead of y'all by lightyears 
All you got ta do is say my name 
And. It strike fear 
, 
Nefarious, I'm the last and the
next greatest 
Contemplate. Your next statement, haters 
 
Bloc, Star 
 
Raised in inferno, 
Look into my eyes, 
And see the fire 
 
Bloc Star, baby
