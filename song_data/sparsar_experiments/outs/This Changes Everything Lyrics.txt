This Changes Everything Lyrics
by The Zolas.


Ten-thousand years.
And we're breaking up like this.
Like the ice between the continents.
We met at a beach fire, I devoured your every nature.
But inside I know you'll never be enough for me.

In the night before the war.
Be the one that I adore.
Flares of light crashing on our shores.
Be the one that I adore.

Years in the wild.
And I can't break my need for wanting.
The beauty that I'm designed for conquering.
We were young and in love.
I built you into religion.
Now I mine your body and refine your blood.
That's my generation.

In the night before the war.
Be the one that I adore.
Flares of light crashing on our shores.
Be the one who says No. No more.
