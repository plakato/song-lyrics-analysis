Down Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: In Triumph.
Down.
DOWN.
Someone´s watching me from somewhere.
When everything is breaking down.
Bare me to your temple mother.
Let me die another day.
I will deny eternity as I´m watching me.
On my way down.
On my way down.
On my way down.
On my way down.
I´m going down.
One step further led me nowhere.
I was stuck inside this haunted house.
Why was I shown all this glory.
Heaven help me come around.
I will deny eternity as I´m watching me.
On my way down.
On my way down.
On my way down.
On my way down.
I´m going down.
I will deny eternity, I will deny eternity.
As I´m watching me.
On my way down.
On my way down.
On my way down.
On my way down.
I´m going down.
