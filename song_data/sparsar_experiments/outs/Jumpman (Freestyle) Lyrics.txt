All this ice and cream, you'd swear we worked for Munch Kings.
Heavy canna-burners, best you call us Bunsen.

Got these thirsty ladies coming in abundance.
WOO.
Some look like Lupita, some like Lauren London.

Some say that we suck? Nah that's them girls who on their.
KNEES.

FLEAS.
Jumpman jumpman jumpman.

Give your hoe the D then bank like Uncle Phil.

This ain't a game, you niggas lame.
You flopping my nigga.
This is a warm up.
Back From Hell soon will be dropping my nigga.
Switching it up.
Just to show I can't fuck with you niggas.
Man I came through with a bad bitch.
Most of y'all rap niggas average.
Niggas fall in love in the pussy.
Me, Lil Saint? I'm a savage.
Look.
Back From Hell, I'm back from hell.
Suck her 'til her pum pum swell.
Hope grandmoms don't hear this shit.
If she does, well oh well.

Rapping, earning, hustling and I'm reinvesting.

Yet they want to crucify me like that saviour.
JEW.

But this is what happens when you have a hit.
