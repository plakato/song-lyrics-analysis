From East to West Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

“What is true joy or hope? Where can it be found? Is it a promise of golden.
streets? Is it in escaping the fires of hell? No. All things are worthless in.
view of the surpassing value of simply knowing God and being known by Him. Oh,.
that I may know Him! To one day see the Savior who purchased my life by His.
very own blood, to see the King who suffered to die for a sinner like me…”.

On that day when I see my king.
And death has lost its sting.

Until then I'm chasing after mysteries.
I'm chasing after mysteries.

Living, You loved me though I fought.
Dying, You saved me, My soul bought.
Buried, You carried my sins away.
You carried my sins far away.

Carried my sins.
Carried my sins far away.
As far as the east is stretched from the west.
Carried my sins far away.
From east to west.
Far away.
From east to west.
Far away.

Suffering, imagine I cannot.
Forgiving, all my sins You forgot.
Rising, you eased our dismay.
You eased me of all my dismay.
All my, all my, all my dismay.

On that day when I see my king.
And death has lost its sting.

Until then I'm chasing after mysteries.
I'm chasing after mysteries.

Carried my sins.
Carried my sins far away.
As far as the east is stretched from the west.
Carried my sins far away.
From east to west.
Far away.
From east to west.
Far away.

I'm looking off into the distance.
And though it may just be a shadow.
I'm chasing after mysteries to find.
The joy in knowing Christ.

“All things are worthless in view of the surpassing value of simply knowing.
God and being known by Him. Oh, that I may know Him! To one day see the Savior.
who purchased my life by His very own blood, to see the King who suffered to.
die for a sinner like me…”.

On that day when I see my King clothed in all of His power.
And His love.
I will join the choirs to sing of His mercies and grace.
With all of His beloved.
All of His beloved.
All of His beloved.
All of His beloved.
