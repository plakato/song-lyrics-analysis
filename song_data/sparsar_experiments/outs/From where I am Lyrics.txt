From where I am Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: The Quill.
&gt;From where I am I've been speeding like a train to find myself again.
But I've stumbled on my homeward bound.
I've been sailing every sea to find pieces out of me.
But I always seem to run aground.
Hey now everywhere I go.
In search for the perfect flow.
I end up as the same old Godforsaken man.
So long, just sound of rain.
Pouring down my windowpane.
It's sad but I can see no sun from where I am.
Oh Mother holding all my reins won't you fill up all my veins.
Though my body's full of bullet holes.
There's no need sewing up my skin cause things that shouldn't.
Be within traded places with my soul.
I can see no sun from where I am.
What's the reason save a man.
A s long as no one understands.
A soul as flat as a leaf, a body fragile as glass.
