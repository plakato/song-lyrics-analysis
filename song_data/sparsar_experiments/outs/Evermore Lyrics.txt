Evermore Lyrics
by Quill.

In my space no rockets ride.
Only echoes of a laughter, in my space.
Well, inside myself a river screams.
And the rapid-flowing water.
Fills my head.

How long until it's time to leave.
How far to what I plead for.
How many days to evermore.

Is it grand, the sight before you.
Yeah the valley of salvation, is it grand.
If you're long gone out in nowhere.
You still can pick up all the pieces.
Thou' you're long gone.
