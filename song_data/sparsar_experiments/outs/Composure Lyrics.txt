Composure Lyrics
by SycAmour.

All I ever wanted was your honesty.

You're being lied to.
The ones that claim your heart.
Are constricting the life from your mind.
You can't face it.
So you maintain the blind.
Sedated, sedated, sedated.
Do you really want to give it all up?
For a sweet scent debasement.
Do you really want to give it all up?
You're placing lives at stake, can't let you walk away.
If I can't make you stop, I'll have to take you out.

Can I get a little tighter grip on my hands, God?
Composure fit for a man:.
If I never see her again?

I will sleep all alone.
Until she comes home.
Or let go.

Let go.

I see the passion slowly leaving from your eyes.
I'm trying to save you.
I tried to save you.
But there was nothing to hold onto.
You were sinking.
I had to leave it.
The void was screaming for your blood.
Give me some perspective.
I'm made of flesh and bone.
I am not your god.
Don't be so pretentious.
You're placing lives at stake, can't let you walk away.
If I can't make you stop, I'll have to take you out.

Can I get a little tighter grip on my hands, God?
Composure fit for a man:.
If I never see her again?

I will sleep all alone.
Until she comes home.
Or let go.

I know, I know we all fear the hounds.
But what's life worth when it's lived underground?
We can save some be we cannot save them all.
Sacrifices must be made.
There's no peace without exchange.
Legs buckle under burdened backs.
But what of free hearts and minds?
Staked, placed inside my hand:.
Contrived.

:.
These snakes I see seething.
Bring promise redeemed for your soul:.
Cheap clothes with loose seams and holes.
Steady your breathing, remember your role.
My whole world, I don't want to have to end you.
Stay the course at hand.
You promised we'd be to the end.
I can't let you take this chance.

All I ever wanted was your honesty.

Can I get a little tighter grip on my hands, God?
Composure fit for a man:.
If I never see her again?

I will sleep all alone.
Until she comes home.
Or let go.
