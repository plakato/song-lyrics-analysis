You Belong To Me Lyrics
by Tyler James Williams.

You wanna know the truth?
Check it out.
How should I describe ya? Sweeter than Godiva.
But your thoughts go deeper than a scuba diver.
Whether you're in sweatpants or dressed in Prada.
You can make me dizzy like a race car driver.
I wanna take you to a party.
Hold your hand and show off to everybody.
Me? I could be in jeans and a hood.
Cause you're so fine you make me look good.

Oh! You're the passion in my life.
You're the secret I can't hide.
There will come a day, I can't wait to say.
You belong to me, girl.
And if I let you know tonight.
It'll be alright I bet.
You don't know it yet.
But baby you belong to me.
Never had a girl get at me like this.
She could read my mind, it's like she a psychic.
Every night, I'm outside her window.
But I can't let her know how I feel, oh.
Every time she near, my heart skip a beat.
And I'm just hoping I can see her on the weekend.
I'll be your best friend, I'll be your homie.
Just stick around so you can get to know me, yeah.
Oh! You're the passion in my life.
You're the secret I can't hide.
There will come a day, I can't wait to say.
You belong to me, girl.
And if I let you know tonight.
It'll be alright I bet.
You don't know it yet.
But baby you belong to me.
You've been looking for the one, I've looking for a dime.
Maybe we can both find it at the same time.
I'm blinded by your shine, you're kinda like the sun.
Cause the world revolves around you 'til my days are done.
I try to say something, but you had me speechless.
I had to hit the booth to tell my secrets.
See I could spit a line, but it's more than my words.
I cannot describe what an angel deserves.

Oh! You're the passion in my life.
You're the secret I can't hide.
There will come a day, I can't wait to say.
You belong to me, girl.
And if I let you know tonight.
It'll be alright I bet.
You don't know it yet.
But baby you belong to me.
Ohhhh!

Yeahhh.

You belong to me.
Baby you belong to me.
