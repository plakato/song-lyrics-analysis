Ben's Song Lyrics
by Two Crown King.

You need to know â€“ along your road 
\-. I will follow you in where you go. 
 
It's been a couple minutes since I've seen you 
\- and just as I expected, every thought has been of me and you 
And, seeing you the way you were the way I know you are 
\- is the way that I'll remember everyday for ever on 
But. I want to go back to having you around 
\- cause, I'm getting these memories and they're heavy and letting me down. 
Getting me down. Getting me drowned in my own thoughts, 
\-, and even though I know they won't. I still hope they don't stop 
But, let it be known. I'M a man of my word 
When. I speak. People listen cause. They probably heard 
\- that I'm a class act.
