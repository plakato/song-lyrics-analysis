Long Time Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


We been getting dough for a long time.
We been fucking hoes for a long time.
Breaking down this dope for a long time.
In the studio for a long time.
Long time, long time.
We been on the block for a long time.
We ain't finna stop for a long time.
We gon' be on top for a long time.
Been talking shit.
And moving bricks.
I fucked your bitch.
She sucked this dick.
You had them kicks.
That same old 'fit.
You ain't been shit.
We gon' be rich.

Long time coming, I been at the bank.
All these bitches on my wood, make your girl walk the plank.
Shit ain't really what you think, All these niggas throwing sets up.
Fake blood  I knew that was ketchup.
I done got my check up, selling Al and Barry cheap.
You ain't got no plug, my nigga you need batteries.
My hoes out this galaxy, my black bitch stacked dog.
My white bitch, she ain't got no ass like CatDog.
I'm back dog, me and my team, we done playing.
I'm in this bitch, more magazines than Shawn Wayans.
Just left a nigga smelling, I heard that he was telling.
It ain't even the money baby it's the Mr. Belding.

I been fucking these hoes  for a long time.
Your bitch wanna fuck me, tell her get to the back of this long line.
Got 99 hoes in front of ya and i'ma put dick in each one of ya.
She wanna be friends with benefits cause my dick longer than her nigga's shit.
Got a couple racks in my pocket nigga hit the mall and I blow it.
Bitch charged me a thousand dollars too much for them damn Gucci Shades, i.
ain't know it.
Nigga last night I counted so many 20s, so many 20s, I lost count.
Got 6 different fucking bank accounts and a half a mill in my momma's house.
My sisters straight and my daddy good, Last night I dreamt I fucked Meagan.
Good.
Keep a white bitch to my crib nigga hole in one like Tiger Woods.
Them long nights in that trap, Three days up with no nap.
Made me the man that I am today and I love to see y'all niggas hate on me.
