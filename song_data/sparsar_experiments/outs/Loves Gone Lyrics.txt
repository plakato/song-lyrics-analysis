Loves Gone BY UNIFIED GIANTS.

Love.
Once again…. Its love.
World Wide.

There ain't no love for no ratchets up in my heart like that.
No love for any haters or suckers, or jealous motherfuckers.
But that's another song that never gets wrote.
And I paid enough attention with that last quote.
There ain't no money in it so im trynna pass go.
So when I pass through I give her what she ask for.
Unless she ask for that cold hard cash though.
I'm quick to say no, no, and another no.
Whether at a show or posted on post cause I go hard… when I go in.
I make swish like im trynna win… yeah, im trynna win like I need them to live.
But her she kind of selfish, she making love no hat, she got a death wish.
And still, she best chick that I've ever seen naked … My God.

When the Loves Gone.
No more talking on the phone, no more going out to eat to see what things can.

When the Loves Gone.
Theres some one else you want, and the one you got can easily shake the spot.

When the Loves Gone… When the Loves Gone… When the Loves Gone.
Going on.

When the Loves Gone.
Gone, Gone, Gone… Gone.

I ain't nothing but a simple man with simple wants from a simple.
A real love I can hold in my hand, and still… I'm trynna understand making up.
sense.
And then I see that love never did pay rent…
And after days of being happy with a text sent.
And my God my God where the time went… she had thinking its this and when its.
that and now I want my time back… yeah, we had a deal but I never did sign.
that.
My style platt and your cushion kind of whack.
So I guess its kind of true, that opposites attract on the real we had to stop.
that.
And still do what you like I'm out for my type… a pretty wife that I nick.
named mines.
All mines to be exact… I only came to come back.

When the Loves Gone.
No more talking on the phone, no more going out to eat to see what things can.

When the Loves Gone.
Theres some one else you want, and the one you got can easily shake the spot.

When the Loves Gone… When the Loves Gone… When the Loves Gone.
Going on.

When the Loves Gone.
Gone, Gone, Gone… Gone.

Yeah, World wide.
Im just letting you know, that I gave it a chance.
We had a good run…. What is the point?
With out expressing love… it's such a beautiful thing.
Where people wake up and that is the end to the dream.
And I see clearly… you know when my eyes are open.
I was hoping you understood that… Love.
You already know what my name is.
If not… you late!
