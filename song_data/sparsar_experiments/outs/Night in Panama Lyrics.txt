Night in Panama Lyrics
by Two Thirds Tan.


I rolled up on a jet black kid.
He started speaking Spanish.
Yo, he wasn't from Panama.
I asked the nigga how the fuck he get so dark.
He said son Tanama.

I spent a night in Panama.
I took a flight from Canada.
I spent a night in Panama.
So take a smile for them cameras.

Ain't no standards for greatness.
I give a fuck about lateness.
Staring into glass.
So I'm saying just face it you faceless.
Most folks racist with races.
But keep in contact like Lasiks.
I stay basic on a basis.
Keep that hiiipower maintenance.
Me and my money congruent.
So you can call that adjacent.
I stay rapping in basements because the answer is payment.
I stay simple with symbols.

We sell kindle to pimple.
I get it poppin' akimbo.
With the lights and the action.
Cameras they stay flashin'.
Passenger seat we passin'.
I grab that belt like we crashin'.
In the lab with the passion.
I got the lights with no action.
With the beard they think I'm jackin'.
But the flow gets a reaction, huh?

I spent a night in Panama.
I can take advantage of that you ain't got my stamina.
I smoke trees like I planted 'em.
So my problems I can manage 'em.
So take a chance if you man enough.
All the homies understand the trust, yup.
They tell me that's what's up.
I pick you up in that white beast.
They ask me if I'm holding weight, I might be.
So please light me.
Cause when I dress I do it rightly.
Spark it up, hit the town, and sight see.
And when it's done we do it rightly.
It's Triple mix it up nightly.
Making speakers bump it's tight, b.
And I just gotta get that right beat.
It turn me to a hype beast.
So bother me, unlikely.
