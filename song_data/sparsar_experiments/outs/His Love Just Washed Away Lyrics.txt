His Love Just Washed Away Lyrics
by Swirlies.

She grew up in warm warm water.
Helps her face look flush and full.
Running laps all around.
The daughter's head keeps spinning like a spiral shell.
And there she goes goes goes.
There she goes into the water.
Swimming with the seals and weeds.
From the trees drops the man who bought her love.
With clothes and promises of make believe believe believe.
He found her body on the seashore.
As he walked his early morning stroll.
Clothes were gone.
Body breathed no more.
Dried by the sun.
He took her in his arms arms arms.
Washed away.
