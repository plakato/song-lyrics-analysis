Go Broke Lyrics
by Yung6ix.


Them say I don high.
Them dey see things.
Pay that runs girl.
Guy you too like free things.
See I'm just a young boy into big things.
Some say me I be werey with big dreams.
All about my paper.
This is no joke.
Pray to God that I die before I go broke.
All about my paper.
Werey this is no joke.
Pray to Oluwa make I die before I go broke.

Trust me you don't wanna see me mad o.
Even Olamide sef know say I be Badoo.
Na my real guy.
But we from different roots.
Same jungle but these days we dey chop different fruits.
What tomorrow holds me I don't know.
What's a Million to me now.
Omo one show……
Damn it mehn we don blow.
Same guy wey those girls be no wan blow.
Mehn I hustle hard till I hammer.
Am living with Tony's payne mehn.
That's not nice you're talking Montana.
Find me up in Abuja.
Popping bottles up in Cobana.
Fruits of my labour.
Shoddy wan take my banana.
See i ain't here to judge you.
George is in the jungle.
So no need to Warri worry.
Cause that's where am from though.
I get you the ticket.
Tell me where you wan go.
But before then you got to register in my condo.

I swear am wide awake.
Jehovah is my witness.
Keep the magazine.
And pray for forgiveness.
Ain't no time to sleep.
I'm tryna live my dreams.
They try to walk in my shoes.
But they can't afford my Timbs.
Mercedes,Riding a new Mercedes.
God in this game and I ain't even talking about eighties.
Some of them gon play this.
Some of them gon hate this.
But ion really like those ladies.
That keep swallowing my babies.

Ehba.
Awon to n relate won gbo mi.
Cause I'm getting getting more money.
They say money talks to'oto ni.
Ah Ehba.
Awa ni Landlord eyin caretaker.
Won ni mo ti n je'wo.
Mo ti n yokun bi t' Obi Asika.
Mo si ‘na fun won Rambo.
Mo si n shey collabo.
Emi ati Yung6ix.
A da bi Trinidad &amp; Tobago.
E fe burn.
Eyan ma niyin.
E kako.
Italian mafia l' Olamide: Roberto Baggio.
Kilon ba mi so.
You talking bullshit.
Watch yourself.
You feel you gat it.
Then you ain't gat it.
Shut the fuck up and watch yourself.
I rep the hoody.
I rep the slum.
Am repping ghetto yes igboro.
Got to get the gucci.
Got to get the nike.
Got to get that louis and timbolo.
Fifty fifty no cheating.
She run around.
I run the city.
You no dey shame.
I no dey pity.
And the things I do e no dey pretty.
We murder them.
Dead bodies in the hallway.
O lo n catwalk.
But this place no be runway.
Hungry lion.
Twelve elephants no do me one day.
Ki lo n shey e.
O de lo n wo bi ti one eye Sunday.

Emi n soro owo.
Awon n gbo bi aja.
Kaka ki ile ku.
Ile a sha.
Dream chaser ni mi.
Won pe mi won pe mi l'omo asha.
