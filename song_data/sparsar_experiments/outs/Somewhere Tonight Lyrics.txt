Somewhere Tonight Lyrics
by Xander the Great.


I say hey when I see you.
I don't need you.
To walk around saying that I'm yours.
My girlfriend's waiting by the door.
She just came back from Vegas, Roulette Tables.
Can't even handle the cash she spent.
The super car she rent.

And I'll be somewhere tonight.
Playing all my cards and I'll be rolling the dice.
Hoping daddy lands on sixes, on sixes.

And I'll be somewhere tonight.
Playing all my cards and I'll be rolling the dice.
Hoping daddy lands on sixes, on sixes.

I say hey fuck the reaver.
She's a free bird.
The worst are the nights when its too raw.
Describing her, I'm inviting her.
To the beginning so she's gliding in.
The air is honoring, her wings astonishing.
Reaching, she's made in America.
What's your telephone, Verizon?

Little girls, big dreams.
Blurry nights, different themes.
I know that you read enough.
Doesn't mean your smarter, love.
Doesn't mean your far enough to reach upon the stars.
