I Have No Fun Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

I have no fun.
I have no fun.
When you're hanging around.
And all you do is bring me down.
So I won't see you.
I won't see you.
I don't wanna.
See you wag your tail at her.
Then ask me to make out later, sure.
A certain plan you have in mind.
But one that's hard to fight.
You hang out with your friends tonight.
You're all too fucked up to decide.
You hang out with your friends tonight.
You're all too fucked up to decide.
What you want.
So what the fuck do you want me to do?
Should I say that you and me are through?
When I have no fun.
I have no fun.
When I see you &amp; her around.
And all I wanna do is shout.
That I won't see you.
I won't see you.
I won't see you.
Am I always the best?
The only girl? Your second best?
Your number one lady? I couldn't tell.
But it's not me oh well.
You hang out with your friends tonight.
You're all too fucked up to decide.
You hang out with your friends tonight.
You're all too fucked up to decide.
What you want.
I have no fun.
I have no fun.
I have no fun.
