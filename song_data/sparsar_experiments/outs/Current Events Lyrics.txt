Current Events Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Just thinkin' 'bout these current events.
While I wait for shit to occur 'till I vent.
Got me nervous again, the nerve of the man.
To kill another innocent black man.
Let's take a trip to Ferguson and.
See whatever is hurting us now, was hurting us then.
That shit hard enough to take, even worse to defend.
No friends, that's what you call a war, feel like a saw it all.
? weapons now we headed to Baltimore.
If he fall, we fall, see y'all scared to.
Let's ? out and be more, ?, careful.
Don't listen to the news, son is more than you see.
Obama gotta have more than a speech.
Nigga, this ain't the type of war to retreat.
Then why you wonder why my ears, shutting off when you speak.
Cause where I'm from, we talk with our feet.
Lot of kids lookin' lost on the streets.
Either, end up in jail or in a coffin deceased.
Man that's deep.

Interlude.
Interviewer: Does it break your heart to see this happening ?
Interviewed: Oh, definitely. I mean, what it is, is...young boys, the young.
folks of this community, showing decades old of anger, frustration. For them.
system has failed. This is more than Freddie Gray, this is about the social.
economics of, of poor urban America, and you know, these young guys are very.
frustrated and upset, and, unfortunately, they're displaying it, in very.
destructive manners.

Now I'm headed to the cemetery, where they would want us.
To dig up, few of the homies they took from us.
A whole tank of oxygen for Eric Garner.
A fresh brand new hoodie for Trayvon Martin.
So Mike Brown, the pipe down, you can't win a ?
When white mans gun rises, another nigga falls.
? back up, before he calls back up.
And try to back us down like Freddie Gray in the ?
Or chill y'all givin' 'em reasons to attack us.
All type of riots, is no longer quite.
For some reason I admire, how we fightin' through the fire.
Speedin' with flat tires, every jungle has lions.
But even as lions, shit is still as hard.
Cause hell, even Mufasa had to deal with Scar.
I say that shit won't happen, they look at me funny.
Then kill Nick Thomas, light up the street from me.
Damn.
