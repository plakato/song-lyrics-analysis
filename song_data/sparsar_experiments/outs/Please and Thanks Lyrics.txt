Please and Thanks Lyrics
by Zip K..


Jaleno 
 
Now, what it look like: 
I'm paid fool, 
Old, hundreds and them new ones. On the way too. 
My heart is celibate 
B-b-but, my brain's screwed 
Walk out the bank like please and thank you 
 
Born in Decatur, but Stone Mountain's where I'm from 
And. Your girl will be coming around that mountain when she come 
And when she come. I'M gon na be the one to tap that like a drum 
If she fall in love, then I guess I got ta run. 
It was just for fun 
Yeah. I made my name in the middle of the city: 
Where, the lights was bright 
And I made a pretty penny. 
 Gim me gim me gim me, anybody
better 
I can't think of any, not many 
If. You want to step it up and get with me 
And. I don't blame them 
And, I don't save them. 
Your lady's favorite thing to say is Zip you crazy, 
 
Money on the table. I get it by any means 
Young and wanted why you think they call me Kennedy. 
You know Imma go in then vamanos 
Enough paper to write a book 
I'm trying to make the chronicles 
 
Now what it look like: 
I'm paid fool, 
Old, hundreds and them new ones on the way too 
My mind's backwards. Turn a souffl√© into a flasou 
Girls want to join my band, but the slots are filled unless you play
flute 
 
So. What you saying 
What you doing 
No reply 
Oh. I knew it 
Them recent funds that done run up done got you stuck up. 
I reply. Make a choice- either come up or shut the fuck up, 
Hey 
What's happening 
Yeah girl, I'm talking to you 
Okay now. Let me show you: how Sky Republic does it 
Alright? These are called Ray Bans. 
Let me wipe them off, 
Alright put them on 
 
My arm. Caressing a model she look like Nelly, Furtado, 
Redhead Kim Possible Christy, Carlson Romano 
Trying - to see how many of her friends can fit in to the Tahoe 
Enough. Ladies to make a choir 
I make them sing in vibrato 
I seen her in them. Stilettos 
My pelvis hear the staccato 
Waitress bring out the bottles 
And, I'm underage, but I'm overpaid 
So. What can she say? 
Them drinks on the way 
Poetic as Aristotle 
Prophetic as Martin Luther 
Perfecting, the Kama Sutra 
I use the world. As my tutor 
And. I be in that thing: sideways 
, 
I jump off in that thing, sideways 
Make some money see how times change 
Sky Republic make a killing and raise the crime rate 
Started with me, and Benjamin Franklin on a blind date. 
I admit it. I did it committed date. Rape 
Now my bank's straight as bows and arrows 
Money curvy, and wide still trying to walk the straight and narrow 
But. You know: Imma go in then vamanos 
Enough paper to write a book 
I'm trying to make the chronicles 
Astronomical 
Sky Republic intervenes 
Young and wanted why you think they call me Kennedy: 
 
Oh, what you say what you say now: 
Oh what you say what you say: What 
Now I can talk? No one gets off. 
I know how you like to 
Now. I can talk. No one gets off 
Okay now. First, we in the bank 
Tell them please and thanks 
Break, some off for Leno 
Keep, my nigga straight 
Grab them mamma, jammas 
Then. We go bananas, 
My, momma, raised me right, 
She told me, don't forget your manners 
So it's please and thank you 
Please and thank you 
Please and thank you. 
Wham bam, 
Please and thank you 
Please and thank you 
Please and thank you. 
Wham bam. 
 
Now. I can talk. No one gets off, 
I know how you like to 
Now. I can talk. No one gets off.
