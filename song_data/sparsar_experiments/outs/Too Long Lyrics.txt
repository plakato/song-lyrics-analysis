Too Long Lyrics
by Xeezy.

As I walk through the.
Valley of Swagg.
With my head to the clouds.
&amp; my feet on the grass.
You see I don't mean to brag.
&amp; I know they think I'm boasting.
While they sleeping on a ni99a.
I guess a giant has awoken.

I've been original since I came out the oven.
I like ma chicks spicy,lil feisty,who's so fly that she hovering.
She gives me loving,so I give her me......
We equal as far as I can see.....
Cause I wanna be in her,while she wanna be me....
She wanna be eased.
See she wanna be teased.
She wanna be reminded why honey bees,give her the bee's knees.
See she wants a man with manners,who is not afraid to please.
She wants a man who's the shit,with paper,she'll nickname him feces.
You see she see's what yo eyes can't perceive.
A real ni99a,he's bigger,make her liver quiver,while you better retreat.

He who doesn't need sleep,he who doesn't need weeks.
I can do what you do,in a shorter time frame, Miami Heats clean sweep.
You see bunch of Boo Peeps.
Female actors Meryl Streep.
Tweety Bird clothing line,they clothes be cheep cheep cheep.
All they do is tweet,never picking up receipts.
If you don't pay the bill,then the Cosby show ain't cheap....

We've been doing this for way to long we've been doing this for way to long.
REAL NI99A WHAT UP?
We've been doing this for way to long we've been doing this we still so strong.
TRINI NI99A WHAT UP.
