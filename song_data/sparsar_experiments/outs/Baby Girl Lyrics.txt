Baby Girl Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


You ain't, nothing like my last chick 
Matter of fact. You got me hoping this relationship can last 
Ask no questions cause. I feel like I been granted my wish 
Been a long time since a brother felt like this 
I'm not going to the club tonight, I'm staying home 
Me and my woman, some Isley Brothers and sip. This Patron 
My homies. They be laughin at me telling me that I'm sprung 
But, I'm in the zone when it comes to lil mama cause she the one 
What. I really love about her. She don't even need a man 
But. She follow my lead and respect the fact I wear the pants 
And. I got no problem. Hullin myself cause she my queen 
Half the time I spoil her half the time, I'm tryin to get her out. Her jeans 
Z-ro still a gangsta. He never been a romantic 
He spends most of his time with semi and fully automatics 
Although. My baby been givin me reasons to leave the streets 
So. Instead of shootin up the block, Imma take baby out to eat 
 
Cuz. She my baby girl, 
I'm, used to the wrong woman 
Now. I got my own woman, 
She so good to me. She got ta, be my 
Baby girl, 
 
No Longer. Do I have to search 
She, a diamond she down to Earth. 
Its Understood to me. She got ta, be mine, 
Baby Girl, 
, 
And Everytime, we sexing 
That hidden room is like a weapon 
Hey. She got ta, be mine, 
Baby Girl, 
 
More than anything she, my friend, 
It ain't, all about the skins. 
I. Don'T ever want this to end 
 
She. Don'T ever have to worry if I'm cheating 
I'm on the way home to give that bottom, a beating 
Even, though I'm what they call a rap singer, 
Wit business to handle. I got time to Carat my woman neck and her finger 
She there for me when life get hard for me 
And. If i get busted she willing to take the charge for me 
But. I can't see her wit handcuffs on for me, 
Soon as they fingerprint 
She. Go be there wit, my bond money 
Feelin, like Martin Luther King Free at Last 
I hate you bitch, is a thing of the past 
Not totally, though I still got up a couple walls 
But. On the other hand, I be feeing for her phone calls. 
And I'll be mad, if I don't get it 
I ain't to gangsta, to admit it, 
So don't play wit me when I'm stressing 
I'll take yo shit and split it 
Hell naw. She ain't no hoe. She, my old lady 
The, one that's, go, gave 3 or4 of Z-ro's babies, 
 
Baby girl, 
I'm, used to the wrong woman 
Now. I got my own woman, 
She so good to me. She got ta, be my 
Baby girl, 
 
No Longer. Do I have to search 
She, a diamond she down to Earth? 
Its Understood to me she got ta, be mine. 
Baby Girl, 
, 
And Everytime, we sexing 
That hidden room is like a weapon 
Hey. She got ta, be mine, 
Baby Girl, 
 
More than anything she. My friend 
It ain't, all about the skins 
I, don't ever want this to end 
 
When. I come home. My bath water and my food ready 
And that lingere she be wearin, be keeping the mood. Steady 
Lord, Heaven must have got robbed cause. An Angel is gone. 
I'M guilty as charged Lord cause. She all up in my home, 

I'll say I do in sickness and in health for better or worse 
Imma still kick. It wit all four homies alive 
When, I'm not in Europe letting baby shop until she drop 
I'm the King and what good is a Queen if she can't rule wit, ya, 
Get out there, like one of the homies and act, a fool wit, ya, 
What's mine is Hers she ain't got ta borrow nothing 
Watch I'll, buy her a beauty shop and a foreign car or something 
And. What'S hers is mine.. All I want is her heart, 
And, of Course, that secret hidden treasure when her legs come apart. 
And, if I was to ever fall off my game, she wouldn't leave me 
She'd help me get back on my feet and back on my CHANGE. 
 
Baby girl, 
I'm used to the wrong woman 
Now. I got my own woman, 
She so good to me. She got ta, be my 
Baby girl, 
 
No Longer. Do I have to search 
She, a diamond she down to Earth. 
Its Understood to me. She got ta, be mine. 
Baby Girl, 
, 
And Everytime, we sexing 
That hidden room is like a weapon 
Hey. She got ta, be mine, 
Baby Girl, 
 
More than anything she, my friend, 
It ain't, all about the skinsI. Don'T ever want this to end
