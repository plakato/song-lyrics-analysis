I'm just tryna make you feel good, you know?

Baby you know i wanna be on you.
I wanna make you call me names.
Baby i'm tryna get all up on you.
I just gotta know if it's okay.
If you're telling me to come through.
Ain't no telling what this'll come to.
Cause this rain is falling.
And that frame is calling.
And it's early morning ma.
Cause i stay up.
And i can make you stay up for me.
I'll have your back on the wall.
Arching your back on the floor.
Ooh girl, let me loose.

Yeayeayea.
Yeayeayea.
What are we doing here?
Girl just give me the go.
And i'll take it from there.
Yeayeayea.
Yeayeayea.
What are we doing here?
Girl give me the go.
I can take it from there.

I can take it from there.
I can take it from there.
What are we doing here?
Girl just give me the go.
I can take it from there.

I told you not to wear a crop top.
And you went and wore a crop top.
Now i'm all on you.
And you can't blame me, cause you asked for it.
I been working all summer on my body.
You should know i'm kind of feeling myself.
But i'd really like you to see.
To put your hands on me.
Baby feel me yourself.
If you're cold, let's take a shower.
If you're hot...let's take a shower.
Teeth clenched, knees bent.

While you wind on me.
Take your time on me.
Babygirl don't stop.
Wind on me.
Take your time on me.
Yeayea just....
Grind on me.
Lose your mind on me, yeayea.
Cloud nine on me.
Realign on me.
'till your body gets weak.

I'm gon' take you there.
I'm gon' take you there and i'm gon'....
Take you down and maybe pull up on your hair.
Girl you know it's bout that time.
And i've been tryna get you here.
Let me take you there.
Let me lick you there, yea.
