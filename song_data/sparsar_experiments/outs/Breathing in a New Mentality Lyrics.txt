Breathing in a New Mentality Lyrics
by Underoath.

I'm the desperate.
And you're the savior.
I'm the desperate.
And you're the savior.
There's been something, something else.
Talking in my ear, someone save me.
When I speak, it begins to decay.
I'm not about to bury myself.
Oh God, my hands are shaking again.
Calm down, calm down.
Now I can't feel the floor.
And my vision takes its toll on me.
I'm the desperate.
And you're the savior.
I'm the desperate.
And you're the savior.
Oh God, it's racing through my veins.
I'm afraid there must be some kinda mistake.
Oh, I'm in over my head again.
Reach in and grab a hold of me.
I'm so scared that I've started to slip.
They say that I'll never change.
I'll prove them wrong, prove them wrong.
It's over, it's over.
I hear the calling but it's passing through.
Clean me up, show me how to live.
I hear the calling but it's passing through.
Clean me up, show me how to live.
Tear me down, let me start again.
