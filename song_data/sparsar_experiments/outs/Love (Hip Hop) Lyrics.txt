Love (Hip Hop) Lyrics
by Visionaries.

Turntable metabolism watercoloring words into visions, 
Respect original graf writers, modern day mathematical pattern detracts biters, 
Hardcore hip-hop in its purest form. Only real b-boys can weather the storm 
And. I'M a b-boy chillin in my b-boy stance, 
I'm lookin for a b-girl that wants to breakdance with me. 
 
My life cycle's circular, so it's got no sides 
At one with the earth. So I claim worldwide 
I reflect cultural duality. 
My locality is my spirituality. 
Key Kool sees through the illusions: natural selections, evolution, 
Rhyme evolution, get your riot gear, 
You say where Visionaries right here: 
 
Ha, I love hip-hop 
I, don't give a ... cause. I love hip-hop 
You, know Visionaries, always rock the spot. 
I don't give a ... cause. I love hip-hop 
 
No, more coal left, caboose train of thought. 
Before you realize lay down in your cof- 
Interview who style is Dannu 
Pen tank emptty. When we do what we do. 
Who be da headless, horseman, swordsman, 
Smashin, pumpkins dunkin, your guts, 
Mock Writer's Block sleep
hollow. In a tux 
Lyrics juxtapose joust, if I must 
 
Lift-ed encrypted 
Zen ripped it so they sit and listen, 
You missed it make a fist with your fingers realistically sticky, like mystic 
Leaving imprints for statistics, holistic, medicine, jettison, 
For synthetic remedies. Remember these lyrical lacerations 
Call, the paramedics, don't edit my context, no contest 
Too complex, like Braille to a seeing eye pet 
 
Ha. I love hip-hop 
I, don't give a ... cause. I love hip-hop 
You, know Visionaries, always rock the spot. 
I don't give a ... cause. I love hip-hop 
 
Give, a ten-string instrument, strung 
Refreshing as a ripe, plum who's. The hyped one 
Put in a page get no answer. 
From. This freelancer contorted, like a breakdancer 
All over this place, wait a mic's in his face 
Finishing top five in the human race. 
No narcotic, just our product rush, the market 
Dollars in the bulls-eye charging red carpet, 
Ole here to stay until tribulation lord rescue me from eternal damnation, 
You chasing freedom, then clinch your fist, 
Put'em cloud bound. So opposition can't miss 
 
Ha. I love hip-hop 
I! Don'T give a ... cause, I love hip-hop 
You, know Visionaries, always rock the spot. 
I don't give a ... cause. I love hip-hop 
 
Ha, I love hip-hop 
I, don't give a ... cause. I love hip-hop 
You, know Visionaries, always rock the spot. 
I don't give a ... cause. I love hip-hop
