Mic Check Lyrics
by Ruse.


Check it, Wyatt Chipman doesn't entice women.
When it comes to fights, he's a chicken, just gives in.
Sometimes, he looks like an idiot.
And even I'd like to get rid of him, but.
Despite that, he can be quite vigorous.
Doesn't fight back cause a mic's what he hits em with.
The gist of it is that this isn't just a nice rap.
It's what I do right. Yes, I'm a little bit.
Odd and different isn't what I'm not but I've got.
Skill with this. When I rap, I rock.
Sit by and witness me killin it.
Give this a minute and we will both benefit.
Despite the deficits, I'm definitely better than.
Most. Won't settle for less than the betterment.
Of hip-hop. Chosen like the Pope Benedict.
To cure rap. Quick, pass me the medicine.
Imma bury em, like the element.
Call me rediculous. Hell, I'll second it.
But on a scale of one to ten, I'm ahead of it.
An eleven, a force not to be reckoned with.
I'm not arrogant, just happily competitive.
Takin jabs for the heck of it. I'm the shit, they're.
Excrement. Call of duty, defend your regiment.
Cube said to check it before you get to wreckin it, so.

Check 1, check 2.
Mic test 'fore I wreck your rec room.
Check 1, check 2.
Mic test 'fore I wreck your rec room.
Check 1, check 2.
Mic test 'fore I wreck your rec room.
Check 1, check 2.
Writin the best rhymes in my bedroom.

Wyatt, sometimes, won't be quiet.
Acts awkward and won't realize it.
He's odd, sure, but different is more like it.
I'd prefer gifted cause I'm awesome.

As dope. So dope, you can get high off it. I'm.
Awesome. Yall can keep on talkin.
Every word, line, song I'm involved with.
Slaughtered. Gawk at a wordsmith evolvin.
Turban's on cause I'm the bomb; Boston.
Sure, mom gave birth to a marathon talkin.
Turd, but tossin insults is absurd.
Jerk-offs, we all cross em often.
Took my shit list and I crossed em off it.
Karma's a bitch but her cross is strong and.
If you're awesome, this is for you to sing along with.
