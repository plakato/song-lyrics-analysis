Neon Lyrics
by Queen of Hearts.


Neon, the light that we were born from.
Flicker, not forgotten.
The heart, it learns to live on.
Rise just like the sun.

Others fall, some may hide.
Defeat them all.
Take the crown and make it mine.
Off the wall, starry eyed.
The lights will come, the dark aside.

There's a love in my core.
It takes me higher.
There's a love in my core.
It takes me higher.
Electrify, we touch the sky.
We come alive.
Broken the chains, lost self-restraint.
We rise up, up, up.

Neon, neon lights shine.
Neon, neon lights shine.

Zion, the land that we are drawn to.
A spirit we hold on to.
The life that we aspire to.
Neon lights shine through.

My heart, it glows.
And stars, they steal the night.
The sky explodes.
A spark that burns bright.
Neon lights, they shine above me.
A spark that burns bright.
Neon lights, they shine above me.

Neon, neon lights shine.
Neon, neon lights shine.
