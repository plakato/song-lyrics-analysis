Back 2 the Base Lyrics
by X.

Man on the bus.
Screaming about Presley.
Man on the bus.
Screaming about Presley.
All tied up, got a knot in his hands.
He says, Presley sucked on doggie dicks.

I'm the king of rock 'n roll.
If you don't like it, you can lump it.
You gotta get me back to the base.
You gotta get me back to the base.

Presley's been dead.
The body means nothing.
Man in the back says Presley sucked dicks.
With a picture of Li'l Stevie over his head.
I'm in the back with a hole in my throat.

I'm the king of rock 'n roll.
If you don't like it, you can lump it.
You gotta get me back to the base.
You gotta get me back to the base.

Man on the bus.
Screaming about Presley.
Rips a newspaper up in his hands.
Helicopter shoots down a military spot.
Everybody runs from screaming about Presley.

I'm the king of rock 'n roll.
If you don't like it, you can lump it.
You gotta get me back to the base.
You gotta get me back to the base.
