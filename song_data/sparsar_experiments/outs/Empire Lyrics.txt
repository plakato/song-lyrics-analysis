Empire Lyrics
by Purple City.

Round, here
You, better watch what you do what you say when you come around here

We, don't play
Cause people die everyday in the streets and we bring the fucking heat
Yo. We some dope boy niggas
Quick to pull triggers
Baskin' on yourselves. It'S an empire round, here
An empire round. Here it's an empire round, here

Yo single supply show mother fuckers
Cause, I'm way flyer than them grown mother fuckers
Watch. You ball on niggas, like I'm playing for the Rutgers
Hate me, so you love it. But I know you niggas wonder
How a nigga come and see something on the internet
Two chicks. Two bricks tell me where the blizzies at
See the money talk for me. Like a nigga do
I told her come out top it's just to match the coupe
And me and Bubz. We piff. Never track the loop
I think he caught me in second right after Snoop
And them hoes don't play they get down here
Big chain, big money. It'S going down around here

Round, here
You, better watch what you do! What you say when you come around here

We, don't play
Cause people die everyday in the streets and we bring the fucking heat
Yo. We some dope boy niggas
Quick to pull triggers
Baskin' on yourselves. It'S an empire round here
An empire round. Here it's an empire round. Here

They know me as the emperor
Purple: that's my signature
Author of the piffington
Writer of the swaggerer
Billion dollar. Bumpington Harlem's ambassador
Byrd got me so much money. I just
got to laugh at ya
Kee. Kee ha ha ha. See me in the Aston Martin
Ultra violet leather cuts BBs laughing though
If you're lookin. For me, you can find me with the claviature
Don't forget: I'm shiesty plus I'm
not, a rapper
Dudes, I'm from the city buck sixty with the baddest hun
Nails fitted hair did stopping all of traffic up
And! That'S on camera for all the amateurs
Big money round. Here: ain't, a problem

Round, here
You, better watch what you do what you say when you come around here

We, don't play
Cause people die everyday in the streets and we bring the fucking heat
Yo. We some dope boy niggas
Quick to pull triggers
Baskin' on yourselves. It'S an empire round, here
An empire round. Here it's an empire round, here

Them niggas act. If they deserve Oscars
Seventeen years old, we had twin boxers
We, sent shots to the imposters
Shrimp scampi crab legs, big lobsters
We hollering money over everything
Streets is my bitch hundred shots was the wedding ring
I love the 40, but the AR bust back
Haze and the dutch match the speed. When I dust past
And tell them Purple City, where I be
And, when you done with the homie, come and try me
Yeah and my bitch had a centerfold
So, don't call my line unless you ten fold

Round here
You, better watch what you do, what you say when you come around here

We, Don'T play
Cause people die everyday in the streets and we bring the fucking heat
Yo. We some dope boy niggas
Quick to pull triggers
Baskin' on yourselves. It'S an empire round here
An empire round. Here it's an empire round. Here
