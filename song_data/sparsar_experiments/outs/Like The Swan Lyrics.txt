Like The Swan Lyrics
by Queen Kwong.


I'm so alone.
I could explode and no one would know.
I'm on a string.
Was once a girl and now just a thing.
I need to eliminate myself from this race.
Car's outta gas and I can't recognize my face.

You don't have to beg.
You don't have to beg.
I just give it away.
I just give in.

Now I sit back.
Once put up a fight but fuck that.
Can't remember when.
I became a shell of cold skin.
I can't have faith when I don't believe in anything.
I can't replace what's gone cause I forgot what I'm missing.

I'm tired of these tiny fires.
I'm tired of these tiny fires.
I'm tired of setting tiny fires and feeling nothing.
I'm tired of you.
