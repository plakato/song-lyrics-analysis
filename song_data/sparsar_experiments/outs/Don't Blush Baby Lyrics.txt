Don't Blush Baby Lyrics
by Xplicit Entertainment.


Baby, baby.
Oh no no no baby.
Oh baby, baby.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Don't.

Christian Kalpee &amp; Mark Hardy.
Don't blush baby.
When I look into your eyes girl.
Don't blush baby.
Why you looking so surprised girl?
Don't blush baby.
I want to bring you into my world.
Cause this feeling's got me going ohhhhh.

Baby girl you....
You got it.
That loving girl.
I want it.
Baby girl you....
Baby you got it.
You got it for real, yeah.

You got it.
That loving girl.
I want it.
Baby girl you....
Baby you got it.
You got it for real, yeah.

Don't blush!
Baby, when you see me in the club.
Don't blush!
Baby, when you see me in the street.
Don't blush!
Even when I sweep you off your feet.
Don't blush!
Even when I kiss you on your cheek, yo.

There's something about the way you walk.
Your pretty little smile, the sexy way you talk.
Yeah, the special way you make me feel.
Beauty and the brains, you got that sex appeal.

Yeah, and now were waiting for the right time.
To hit the dance floor and take a small wine.
I know you think of me, yeah when it's night time.
So maybe we could chill, and take a small lime.

Cause I got what you want.
And baby you know what you need.
It's only one life to live, girl.
And that's the way we know we must proceed so.

Christian Kalpee &amp; Mark Hardy.

Ooh ooh.
Just one look in the windows of your soul, baby.
Ooh ooh.
I feel I could I could stay with you 'til you's and old lady.
Ooh ooh.
We could go out and we'll sip something cold baby.
Ooh ooh.
Let me hit it out the park after taking in a bowl baby.

Nah, I ain't bluffing.
I used to hit wild, but you'll never catch me fronting.
Once you promise me that you'll never stump him.
I know the boundaries after you I'm running.
Let me tell you something.

Your lips I wanna taste, sensual embrace.
Could see it in your face, want a better space.
To be in, you.
said you're fed up being chased.
By little boys..
Wanna hold a special place.

Inside my heart? That I promise you baby.
Why you're face getting rosy like a flower though baby?

You're playing bashful: don't try that!
Come to Isaac.
Cheeks turn lilac.

Things move quick like a time lapse video.
Touching up my body like a physio.
Let's make what we have official.
Then do like Sean Paul, and get busy doe.
Just....

Christian Kalpee &amp; Mark Hardy.

Yeah, yeah, yeah ooh!
Baby! Don't blush baby.
When I'm rocking your waist like this.
And when I looking at you like this, oh girl!
You got it!
So yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Christian Kalpee &amp; Mark Hardy.
Don't blush baby.
When I look into your eyes girl.
Don't blush baby.
Why you looking so surprised girl?
Don't blush baby.
I want to bring you into my world.
Cause this feeling's got me going ohhhhh.

Baby girl you....
You got it.
That loving girl.
I want it.
Baby girl you....
Baby you got it.
You got it for real, yeah.

You got it.
That loving girl.
I want it.
Baby girl you....
Baby you got it.
You got it for real, yeah.
