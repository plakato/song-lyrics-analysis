From the Sun Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.


Isolation can put a gun your in hand.
It can put a gun in your hand.
It can put a gun in your hand.
If you need to, you can get away from the sun.
You can get away from the sun.
You can get away from the sun.
If you need to, you can get away from the sun.
If you need to, you can throw away the only one.

I'm so tired, but I can never lay down my head.
I can never lay down my head.
I can never lay down my head.
I'm so lonely, but I can never quite reach the phone.
I can never quite reach the phone.
I can never quite reach the phone.
I'm so lonely, but I can never quite reach the phone.
I'm so lonely, I've gotta eat my popcorn all alone.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Isolation can put a gun your in hand.
It can put a gun in your hand.
It can put a gun in your hand.
If you need to, you can get away from the sun.
You can get away from the sun.
You can get away from the sun.
If you need to, you can get away from the sun.
If you need to, you can throw away the only one.
