Christmas in Hollis Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

Run 
It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark 
When. I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park. 
I approached very slowly with my heart, full of fear 
Looked at his dog. Oh my God, an ill reindeer 
But. Then I was illin' because the man had a beard 
And a bag full of goodies 12 o'clock had neared 
So. I turned my head a second and the man had gone 
But. He left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn 
I picket the wallet up. But then I took a pause 
Took out the license and it cold said Santa Claus: 
A million dollars in it cold, hundreds of G's 
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease, 
But I'd, never steal from Santa cause that ain't right, 
So, I'm going home To mail it back to him that night 
But when I got home, I bugged, cause under the tree 
Was a letter from Santa and all the dough was for me: 
 
D.M.C., 
It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens, 
Mom's, cooking chicken and collard greens, 
Rice and stuffing macaroni And cheese, 
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees 
Decorate the house with lights at night, 
Snow's on the ground, snow white, so bright, 
In, the fireplace is the yule log 
Beneath, the mistletoe as we drink, eggnog 
The rhymes, you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's 
But each And every year we bust Christmas, carols, 
, 
Run-D.M.C., 
Rhymes so loud and proud. You hear it 
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit. 
Jack, Frost, chillin' the
hawk is out 
And, that's what Christmas is all about. 
The time is now the place is here: 
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer 
 
D.M.C. 
My name's D.M.C., with the mic in my hand, 
And I'm chilling and coolin'. Just like a snowman 
So open your eyes, lend us an ear. 
We want to say 
 
Run-D.M.C., 
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,
