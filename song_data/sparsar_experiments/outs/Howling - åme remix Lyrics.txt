Howling - Ã¥me remix Lyrics
by Ry.

Hot nights coming.
Keep the car running.
Lavender fingers.
Swallow my pollen.
Gold i swam into your spell.
On the rite of god we fell.
You were plush and i laid bare.
You had me howling.
Cold i fell into your skin.
On the night you led me.
Under your sin.
You had me howling.
You had me howling.
Blush.
Golden siren.
Under exposing.
Come lay your weakness down.
On the floor in the backseat.
Gold i swam into your spell.
On the rite of god we fell.
You were plush and i laid bare.
You had me howling.
Cold i fell into your skin.
On the night you led me.
Under your sin.
You had me howling.
You had me howling.
Blush.
Blush.
