Save The Last Dance Lyrics
by Union J.

I know you catch a lot of hearts, baby.
Got them lining up tonight.
You got them all revolving right and round.
You're like a thousands satellites.
Now they're falling hard.
Like a house of cards.
They blow away like leaves.
I know that when the night is over.
That you're gonna save the last dance, save the last dance, for me.
Instrumental.
You're rocking with your girl friends.
Take over while you're dancing.
You watch me, while I'm watching.
But you act like, it ain't nothing.
The way that you're moving.
I feel right into your grooving.
I'm just about to prove it.
Cause all night you've been getting all your drinks for free.
And fakin' takin' numbers on your bold bb.
But you'll be coming home with me.
I know you catch a lot of hearts, baby.
Got them lining up tonight.
You got them all revolving right and round.
You're like a thousands satellites.
Now they're falling hard.
Like a house of cards.
They blow away like leaves.
I know that when the night is over.
That you're gonna save the last dance, save the last dance, for me.
Instrumental.
When it's rocking, I roll in.
Your waist line, I'll be holding.
With his bass line, controlling.
I'll have the rest of them folding.
The way that you're moving.
I fit right into your groove and.
I'm just about to prove it.
Cause all night you've been getting all your drinks for free.
And fakin' takin' numbers on your bold bb.
But you'll be coming home with me.
I know you catch a lot of hearts, baby.
Got them lining up tonight.
You got them all revolving right and round.
You're like a thousands satellites.
Now they're falling hard.
Like a house of cards.
They blow away like leaves.
I know that when the night is over.
That you're gonna save the last dance, save the last dance, for me.
Instrumental.
I know you catch a lot of hearts, baby.
Got them lining up tonight.
You got them all revolving right and round.
You're like a thousands satellites.
Now they're falling hard.
Like a house of cards.
They blow away like leaves.
I know that when the night is over.
That you're gonna save the last dance, save the last dance, for me.
