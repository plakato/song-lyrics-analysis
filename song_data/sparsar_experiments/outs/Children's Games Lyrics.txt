Children's Games Lyrics
by Wrekonize.


In, a kingdom where the kings are lost to chase expensive things, 
I feel so gone and overblown when rulers forfeit up their throne, 
This rock made up of dirt and sand. It'S seems was built to hurt the land 
I find that space hard to escape, see poison, picks. No one man, 
 
Let's, breath a new type of meaning change. A few axioms 
Return, the the crossed cost of the innocence lost then break barriers. For
Some 
I could have sworn we were dreaming nightmares in the sun, 
The heating grease even eats the rational ones grown folks. Acting young 
I sped up the road to home 
To, get away from the clones and just try to hold my own 
It's funny. How we still try see 
The years have been growing old, but some didn't wan na know 
And. Now they walk without their souls either way we still die 
 
How. Can I be called to serve in a place that I think so absurd 
I find it strange and quite insane that grown men still play children's games. 
How can I be called to serve in a country. I only observe 
I find it strange and quite deranged that grown folks still play children's
games 
 
I'm walking cross the planet. The damage is 20 fold. 
You can learn the law of language and dance in the devil's home, but 
Some people's canvas is crammed with childproofery 
State covered safe, colors, quite suitably 
I'm. All for kid. At heart, when the mind is advanced, 
I believed that we achieve with the time and a chance but 
Some painters, wan na water color in the rain 
Their job benefits should probably cover the insane 
If there's a minute, I'm about to get it. I need to breathe. 
The lead is limited, 
See I'mma be primitive. The end is imminent, 
I seen it in the dreams that I had 
Playing band on the Titanic. Next to my dad, 
I saw the sun setting for the last time that evening 
Military telegram Mom. I'M still bleeding 
I wrote my last words in blood upon the ceiling. 
While, a bunch of grown men kill each other for no reason.
