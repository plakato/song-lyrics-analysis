Do U Feel Pain Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Huh yeah Mr. Pain, nigga 
He. Don'T feel me ain't real, so he don't exist. 
Poof be gone, 
 
Now! When you cut, does it bleed and when it hurts, you feeling me 
 
Black on black crime in the ghetto mama lost. Another son, 
 
Prisons got another baby. Whole life done been shady 
 
If. You don't feel it. Then you numb nigga. We know pain where I'm from nigga 
 
Yung Ro 
How long. Can I take this put up with fake shit. 
Keeping. It basic, don't think I'ma make it 
It's hard to face. It got everyone waiting 
Went from Carrio hero, called it anticipating 
But. Sometimes I wan na cut my mic off 
Sometimes. I wan na go to my room and cut the lights off 
And meditate, to find peace and try to remember my purpose. 
But. This pain is on my brain. I can't pretend it ain't hurting 
So. I got use to it and made pain. My friend 
Shit, I figured get cool with him. Hey he coming again, 
You, never seen a spiritual lyrical miracle worker 
And. This material hearing is my superior working 
Through me and I try to keep it all positive 
But. If you only understood just how hard it is. 
Well, what's worse, is this chip on my shoulder just keep getting bigger, 
Tired of watching that same picture vision, ain't, getting clearer, 
Plus! I can't even find a remote to change the channel. 
Call me. Nobody, the Unknown, hid all deranged from scanners. 
Like David Banner might get ya, broke, stole shot up 
Hey-ho. No, I bet ya. Your ass think about us. 
They lock up us in the Penitentiaries 
Them do's revolving been going on for centuries, 
I feel the flames of the game and the pain that it brings. 
I'M still a mayn, but I remain out my frame when it rains 
Cause I'm a nobody. Nigga yeah. I know you feel me coming man 
Walking, not running man creeping with my gun in hand, 
A funny man and never hollered back 
But. That'S the end of that story. Don'T believe me, then holla back
