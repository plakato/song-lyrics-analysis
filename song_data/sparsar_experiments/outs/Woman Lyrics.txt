Woman Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


Woman.
You know you're woman.
You got to be a woman.
I got the feeling of love.

When you're.
You're talkin' to me.
You see right through me.
I got the feeling of love.

She's a woman.
You know what I mean.
You better listen.
Listen to me.
She's gonna set you free.
Yeah-ah, yeah.

Well you're kinda looking at me.
Like I've got to set you free.
I can't be nobody.
