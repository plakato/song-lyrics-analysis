The Sound Of Sloppy Kisses Lyrics
by Vogue.

I took a walk down the black valley, cause I was not sleepin.
Well, I took it down to the crack side of town.
I took a walk down to the streets, they were crawling with orphans.
Well, six thousand children bent upon the ground.

A colony of contortionists twisting up their bodies.
With inhuman grace.
With impossible shapes.

Brandy was hanging from a cigarette billboard.
Oh, laughing la la la la.
Shiny like scales and bent up like a boa.
Oh, laughing la la la la.

Brandy was hanging from a cigarette billboard.
Oh, laughing la la la la.
Shiny like scales and bent up like a boa.
O, laughing la la la la.

You always come here to watch the children.
And I always find you when I want excitement.
She's just like them, born shapeless, without bones.
Just a grinning skull and rubber skin left to rot in the valley of orphans.

Show me your mystery girl.
Pump the ripe back into me girl.
Show me your mystery girl.
Pump the ripe back into me girl.

We're getting higher than the moon.
Sniffing airplane glue.
We're getting higher than the moon.
Sniffing airplane glue.

I can't spend another day living life through a screen door.
Sleeping on the springs of your mattress.
I've got to leave the country.
Let's steal a truck and drive the fuck out of Kansas.
