Looks Like Trouble Lyrics
by The Virus.

Watch out she's going down the steps.
It's 9 o'clock and the party hasn't even started yet.
4 - 5 - 6 Cee Lo!
In the morning wake up and wonder, where'd my money go?

What's next? Who knows!
It happens everywhere we go.
We find trouble everyday.
All day, all night.
It's how we live our lives.
It's in the songs we play.

Another 18 hour drive.
The Dote has a barrel, Huib's got a Whopper and Jackie brought wine.
5000 miles from home.
Then it's back in the van and on the road and say, goodnight goat!

What's next? Who knows!
It happens everywhere we go.
We find trouble everyday.
All day, all night.
It's how we live our lives.
It's in the songs we play.
