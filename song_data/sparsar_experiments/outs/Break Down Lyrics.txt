Break Down Lyrics
by Wrekonize.

Ah Ah Ah C'mon C'mon Come C'mon Yeah.

I seen them wandering.
Like they don't know where to go.
Like they don't know how to live.
Like they don't want us to grow.
I seen them squandering.
This little gift that I hold.
This little fist that I close.
Ain't gonna be bloody no more Ah Ah.

If you need me you'll find me digging up the trench.
Right behind the park bench.
I've been underground since.
They put up this here fence.
Wanna hold me back but I can't be contained.
Wanna close the latch but I can't be arraigned.

I built this fucker from the ground up.
Latening the sounds up.
Acting like a foul slut.
Will get you asking â€œNow what?
You can't imagine what I've seen so far in this life, this life, this life.

I've built walls, they only break down.
Break down.
They only break down.
They only break down.
They they only break down.
B-b-break down.
They only break down.
They only break down.
No, no, no.

I seen them acting like.
They ain't got nowhere to be.
They ain't got nothing to need.
Cause life is simply a dream Ah Ah.
I seen them killing us.
At the whim of their greed.
Even women would see.
See nobody is free.

If you need me you'll find me breaking down your doorstep.
Caught you catching your breath.
Two turns into more steps.
Hide under the floor guess it's every man for himself these days.
Guess it's hard to pay when you know other ways.

I know a million mother fuckers who sweat just for the check.
And carry planets on their shoulders with a load of regret.
You would not believe the places I have been to try and live out this life,.
this life, this life.

I've built walls, they try to break down.
Break down.
They only break down.
They only break down.
They they only break down.
B-b-break down.
They only break down.
They only break down.
No, no, no.
