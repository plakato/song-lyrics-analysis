Broke Nigga Moves Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Ay shawty, we were wondering if we could borrow some brown sugar.
We yo goddamn new neighbors.
And if it's cool let me get 2 eggs and a slice of cheese man.
Feel me.

I'm on the south side that's where Dae Dae chill.
I'm rocking fake Js but I say they real.
I only bought em cause the colors match.
Got em at the flee market I can't bring them fuckers back.
If anybody peep that they would probably show us.
I might wear em tomorrow if nobody notice.
And fuck a retail I wait for the low.
Same outfit 2 days in a row.
She says she hate it when I call women bitches.
I said I hate the fact that all her niggas bitches.
Got a couple hoes got a few tramps.
Got a grown bitch I'm using for her food stamps.

Broke nigga moves 3x.
This how broke niggas do.
Broke nigga moves 2x.
I know, I used to be a broke nigga too.

I'm on the north side that where Teezy be.
Couple turkeys and a bootleg DVD.
Laughing at my pain shit it funny partna.
Coulda hit the movies but that would have cost me 20 dollars.
Man I'm starving hope my bitch home.
Only nigga in the club with a flip phone.
Bill collectors tryna wrestle like I'm Steve Austin.
Hate driving downtown ain't no free parking.
All these road trips, but if yo man fly.
Fuck a first class, bitch I'm stand-by.
Broke nigga make you sit, I ain't asked y'all.
Driving fast heard my nigga selling gas cards.

They call me Teezy on the north side.
Get it free with no ID up in sports line.
Yo bitch yelling from courtside.
Never mind that silly ho.
Chose up cause she seeing me with a helicopter in my video.
Now the more money I make, the less I wanna spend.
Ain't no smoking up all my weed and I ain't feeding your friends.
No I can't, you get's no love.
Lame ass try and catch a dollar at the strip club.
