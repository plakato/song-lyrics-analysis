The Runaway Lyrics
by The World Alive.

You get caught in a hurricane.
Scattered thoughts make you go insane.
You lock yourself in your own cage.
Hide the keys and then fade away.

You are not alone.

We can get through it tonight.
I will be the anchor to your runaway train tonight.
I will be the beacon when you're feeling insane.
I know it hurts sometimes, so I'll get in line with you.
Tonight, I will be the anchor to your runaway train.

I will be your anchor.

You think this could be the end.
An afterlife is just pretend.
Illuminate the darkest days.
I'm never leaving your side, I'm here to stay.

You are not alone.

We can get through it tonight.
I will be the anchor to your runaway train tonight.
I will be the beacon when you're feeling insane.
I know it hurts sometimes, so I'll get in line with you.
Tonight, I will be the anchor to your runaway train.

Never look back, never regret, all of the words you said in hope.
Never pretend, never the end, there's always a fight to win.

Tonight, I will be the anchor to your runaway train.
Tonight, I will be the beacon when you're feeling insane.
I know it hurts sometimes, so I'll get in line with you.
Tonight, I will be the anchor to your runaway train.

I will be your anchor.
