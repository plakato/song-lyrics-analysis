Song of a Bitch Lyrics
by Rune.

Who am I to tell you how to live?
I guess that kindness isn't necessary to give.
Go on keep living for yourself.
I bet it's great to never think of anyone else.

You fucking liar you think you've got empathy?
Well it's only for people that you never have to meet.
You think no one else can understand.
Well I do.

You feel so free.
But you're lying to yourself, like you're lying to me.
Your selfish needs.
Blind you to any truth that you claim that you can see.

Maybe I can see some validity in your personal abstractions.
But I can feel.
The weight that you have lifted by forgetting your own actions.
I once believed that you could overcome your ego.
But now you've given in to all these.
Pathetic schemes.
To become the heartless person you've always wanted to be, so.

Fuck your freedom.
You're lying to yourself like you're lying to me, lying to me.
You're selfish needs.
Blind you to any truth that you claim that you can see.

I remember who you could have been.
A lover and a fighter hiding roses in the trees.
I know you tried.
But your weaknesses were just too tempting.

Fuck your freedom.
You're lying to yourself like you're lying to me, lying to me.
Your selfish needs.
Blind you to any truth that you claim that you can see.

Are you safe inside of that hole.
You egoistically dug inside of your soul.
So salvation only comes when you're alone?
You'll never go further just faster you know.
