Death And Rats Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

When I see the light why is it terrifying.
It's terrifying, it's coming up, I'm going down.
Down into the streets that got me here.
It's blinding, blinding light, it's not supposed to rain today.

I see it now, it was just moving too fast.
I see it now like a reflection in my past.
Rivers of poison that surround us.
On an island full of death and rats, subways and taxicabs.

And you, and those blinding lights.
Yeah you and those blinding lights.

I just want to sleep why is it never over.
The day before keeps running through my head I need the.
Downs in the street, it's awe inspiring.
The strangers passing, nobody stops to say goodbye.

I see it now, it was just moving too fast.
I see it now like a reflection in my past.
Rivers of poison that surround us.
On an island full of death and rats, subways and taxicabs.
All night bars, and mistakes you know I made before.
Days and nights, endless, overripe, buses and traffic lights.
And tourists with subway maps and.

You and those blinding lights.
Yeah you and those blinding lights.
Yeah you and those blinding lights.
Yeah you and those blinding lights.
Shining on the death and rats.
