Cloud song Lyrics
by United States of America.

How seet to be a cloud.
Floating in the blue.
It makes him very proud.
To be a little cloud.
How sweet to be a cloud.
Floating in the blue.
How sweet to be a cloud.
Floating in the blue.
It makes us very proud.
To be a little Cloud.
How sweet to be a cloud.
Floating in the blue.
