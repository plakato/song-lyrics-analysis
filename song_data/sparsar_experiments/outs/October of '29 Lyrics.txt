October of '29 Lyrics
by Worthwhile.


Cast off for coal ?
The roaring 20s against the young and the old.
Rush out west.
Try and fill your chest.
As greedy as the grave.
My death never ?
As you dig, as you dig.
That bottom left spent?

We had greed in spades.
Light an early ?
Of a guilty ace.
Privileged, selfish.
? to his poker face.
Split, hit, double down.
Watch himself in that paper chase.
Chin high, blind eyes.
Guess he never lived a life as grace.

? deep in ?
The ? life is such a fickle thing.
The end will show it's all fool's gold.
? all the world ?

October '29 ?
?, a panic of Wall Street.
This end, ? 6 and 10.
Raise your hope or flag.
Surrender what you have.
Money talks but never tells the truth.
In the end, it's only passing through.

In gold we trust.
In gold we lust.
How hollow is your chest?
Dust to dust.

In gold we trust.
In gold we lust.
How hollow is your chest?
Dust to dust.
