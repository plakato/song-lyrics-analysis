24-7 Lyrics
by Quasimoto.


Like a .357 hitting on 365 
Checking them dead or alive 
With. My man, 
 
Listen up 
I, make it pop when I drop the rhyme 
No corrupting your spot that mops 
MC's out the box. So I remain on top 
Number one contender assassin 
Blast, a rhymes attracting 
Green weed bitches and cash 
Then, I'm 
Southern Cali' wild raise for action. 
Crazed will leave the rhymes packed in 
My verbal clip come packed for easy access. 
The fact is your crew is backwards. 
Stepping up to the real 
Yo MC shady got the record deals. 
Lyrically getting peels still 
I feel you recognize 
There's more than just size, 
It's all about. Do you got heart 
And. Do you come real with rhymes 
Times up, never run up 
Hit your roster. Getting done up 
Paralyzed from the neck up 
Hold the checking up doing up 
Crews for the coming up, 
I'm faster when it comes to cash. 
I, speed fast past to leave you whiplashed 
To watch. We spread around like crabs. 
To quickly get in that ass 
For. The future present and past 
Lacing tracks, like hash, 
, 
Checking, weak, mark MC's, 
Everyday all day 
Is, where I stay 
Deep on the west, 
Real MC's don't play 
We, lay it down just like that, 
Or better. Yet like this 
Rhymes on deck, 
Leaving fake, MC's check, 
, 
The, Ill Loop, Digga, ..., 
What, 
 
Ch-Check, one two, two two 
I come through 
Like volcanic eruption, Ginsu 
Knives, cutting right through you, 
Hit you off with lyrical stanzas 
Hit you off with questions or answers 
Running Through MC's, like 
Cancel, you 
Can't compete 
When, I throw on my beat 
When. I write a rap 
When. I get on the turntables and scratch 
Nigga's try to attach 
Y'all nigga's, get snatched up 
Mashed up for trying to act up 
Why you half step to my rep
 
Now you're, going in debt 
The Ill Loop dig upon set word back 
Got to give like I'm hitting Headcracks 
Going, through your back like some lead black 
Never, give a wack nigga, no slack 
Get the prozac 
Niggas, always hollering about 
Where the hoes at 
Or 
I. Don'T even like that nigga man 
But, where my foes at 
Hey I'm going to take that nigga out man. You see my strap 
Bunch of bluffing 
Kill that nigga right now, 
And everyone knows that 
 
Check, the weak mark, MC's 
Everyday all day 
Is, where I stay 
Deep on the west, 
Real MC's don't play 
We. Lay it down just like that, 
Or better. Yet like this 
Rhymes on deck, 
Leaving fake MC's check, 
Check ... check ... check, ... 
, 
 {. We must get closer to the essence of life, } 
 {, But beware that it take courage, and
strife, },
