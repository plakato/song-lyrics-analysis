Rush Apart Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

It's too late now to rush apart.
When your aching heart wasn't amplified.
And if you drain the fluid from.
My screaming lungs I know I'll die.

And it's hard to know what's right.
When I'm needing you tonight.
And you're needing me tonight.

It's too late now to hold on to the crutch.
When you open arms and open heart you can never hold too much.
If I drain the beauty from.
Your bleeding blood I know I'll die.

Oh, I never tried to.

But it's all been done.
We'll hold on tight.
And I will hold on to you.

And the beating blood drives an empty love.
While I hold on to you.
And oh lord I know it's true.
