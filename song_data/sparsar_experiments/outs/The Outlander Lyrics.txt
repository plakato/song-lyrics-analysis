The Outlander Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Hear him calling out.
Don't be a fool, cast away this solitude.
Behold the wisdom which reveals the truth.
Cruel twist of fate, or foretold destiny.
Welcome the power it is yours to take.

Out of the sun, a figure comes.
Somehow he knows of everything I've done.
Time to arise, apologize.
He leads me on towards the brightening skies.

Nowhere to turn, dishonored.
Pulled me from the fire where I laid to burn.
He sails away, break of day.
Knowing his words forever resonate.
