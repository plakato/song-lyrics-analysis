If I'm Not Right Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Love don't come easy like it use to.
It's hard to get in a modern world.
I struggle everyday just to make it through.
All my life not a single pearl.

If I'm not right.
Baby, it's gotta be wrong.
I'd give my life.
To hold you baby once in my arms.

Things will come together like it should be.
And you will notice me someday.

When all I can see is the you and me.
I'm waiting for you to look my way.

Things will come together like it should be.
And you will notice me someday.
When all I can see is the you and me.
I'm waiting for you to look my way.
