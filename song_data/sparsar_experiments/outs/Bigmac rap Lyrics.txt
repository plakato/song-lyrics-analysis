Bigmac rap Lyrics
by Unknown.


I need a double cheeseburger and hold the lettuce.
Don't be frontin' son.
No seeds on the bun.
We be up in this drive thru.
Order for two.
I gots a cravin' for a number 9 like my shoe.
We need some chicken up here, in this dizzle.
Fo' rizzle ma nizzle extra salt on the frizzles.
Dr. Pepper my brotha.
Another for yo motha.
Double double super size.
And don't forget the fries.

That's about it.
