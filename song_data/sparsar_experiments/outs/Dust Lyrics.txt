Dust Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Won't somebody tell me what this heaven's about.
It's been coming for years and I've noticed it's almost here.
You're just one of us so take to the hills.
Hide the underground it's almost time.
I got away I keep all my guns in an oak cabinet.
I'll be ready for the next time because I never forget.
My father bleeds his history in everyday.
