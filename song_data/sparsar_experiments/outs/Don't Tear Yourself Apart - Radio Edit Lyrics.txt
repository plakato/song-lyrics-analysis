Don't Tear Yourself Apart - Radio Edit Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

When tears blind what's around, don't tear yourself apart.
When it all seems to bring you down, don't tear yourself apart.
I can promise you better ways.
We'll be living in better days.
I can see through the harder times.
We'll be living better lives.
When all those things you've found.
Can't mend your broken heart.  With all.
emotions drowned.

Like you're falling apart.  I can promise you.
better ways.
We'll be living in better days.
I can see through the harder times.
We'll be living better lives.
Don't tear yourself apart.
When tears blind what's around, don't tear yourself apart.

When it all seems to bring you down, don't tear yourself apart.  I can promise you better ways.

We'll be living in better days.  I can see there's.
a chance always.
I can see through the harder times.
We'll be living better lives.
Don't tell yourself apart x4.
Like you can't stop at the red light x4.
