For James Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

Stow your eyes, there's always something to cry about.
Save your mind, death it thrives in defeat.
Leave the children they don't know better.
Sticks and stones from lace and leather.
Cleaning out the sand between the sheets.
Cold sober frowns, you're older now.
Listen to the warning.
Is it colder on the inside.
Is it colder on the inside.
Is it colder on the inside.
Is it colder on the inside?
Hold on to me.
Shed your bones, there's always marrow to keep afloat.
Grind your teeth for quid between the sleeves.
Leave a note for the untamed spirits.
Moving up north, I'm your outer limit.
21 degrees will keep you clean.
Is it colder on the inside.
Is it colder on the inside.
Is it colder on the inside.
Is it colder on the inside?
Hold on to me.
Let me be.
Hold on to what we leave between.
Just hold on to me.
