Home Production Lyrics
by Ty.


Take a look, at the world.
See all the destruction.
If you really can't tell.

See the world begin to end.
As I start conduction.
You can see it's the result.
Of my home production.

Turn around, take a breath.
Say goodbye to all your stress.
You don't need to deal with that.
I'll help you clean up all this mess.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I know you have great love for me.
But all that shits for in the past.
I really felt like it would last.
Fuck that shit your dead to me.
Stab my back but soon you'll be.
Strugglin' to fuckin' live.
While I'm out makin' positives.
Fuck you and your family.
The people I didn't really see.
When you come back beggin'.
Ima put your ass on blast.
