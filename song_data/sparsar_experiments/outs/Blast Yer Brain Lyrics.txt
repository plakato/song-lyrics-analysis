Blast Yer Brain Lyrics
by Sway.


You got to scream your.
Guts out baby.
You got to scream and shout.

When life isn't just.
The way you want it.
You got to let it out.
Ooh yeah.

Nuclear blow.
Atomic flow.
What a show.
Way to go.
Run away.
Don't you stay.
On your way.
Gotta pray.

Liberty on tv.
Let that be your relief.
Baby dies.
Mama cries.
Starving eyes pay the price.
FBI.
Eye to eye.
Never lie or you will fry.
CIA.
JFK.
Dallas day blown away.
Satellite race.
Shuttle days.
Starfight ace killed in space.
Take a trip man.
Be a flip man.
Let it rip man.
Love my whip now.

You gotta scream your guts out baby.
You gotta scream and shout.

When life isn't just.
The way you want it.
You gotta let it out.

USA goes astray.
Day by day in every way.
Big disease never cease.
Kills the east like a beast.

Record rates.
Wall street mates ignore the fates.
Third world states.
Bomb a plane over spain.
Hide in vain.
Claim insane.
Sex debate in every state.
X-rate what you make.
Screw your mate.
Fuck his date.
Do it if it makes you feel great.

I'm a hit.
I don't know shit.
I'm staying fit by getting it.
Don't go to school.
Don't be a fool.
Just play it cool.
Make your own rules.

You gotta scream your guts out baby.
You gotta scream and shout.

When life isn't just.
The way you want it.
You gotta let it out.

Blast no brain.
Blast no brain.
Blast no brain.
Yeah-yeah-yeah.

Blast no brain.
Blast no brain.
Blast no brain.
Yeah-yeah-yeah.

President.
Money spent.
Pay the rent.
Intelligent sex thrills.
Sex kills.
Elvis lives.

What gives.
Right or wrong.
Weak or strong.
Short or long.
Off or on.
Rich or poor.
What's the score.
I'm not sure anymore.

Big bro.
Video.
Always know where I go.
Coke flows.
Money goes.
Up my nose.
Overdose.

My head is void.
I can't avoid.
Paranoid.
Paranoid.
So scared inside.
No place to hide.
Eat cyanide.
Get one last ride.

You gotta scream your guts out baby.
You gotta scream and shout.

When life isn't just.
The way you want it.
You gotta let it out.

You gotta scream your guts out baby.
You gotta scream and shout.

When life isn't just.
The way you want it.
You gotta let it out.

You gotta scream your guts out baby.
You gotta scream and shout.
