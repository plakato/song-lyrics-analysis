Male Gaze Lyrics
by The Zolas.


Everything is ok.
Woman in the window.
I play her body like a feminine nintendo.
Gotta make that ratio.
Of prince and asshole.
But again the princesses are in another castle.

C'mon girl we can freak out a bit.
C'mon girl we can get low.
C'mon girl we can freak out a bit.
Oh can't you see I'm freaking out on my own.

Should've been a cocaine dealer in the 80s.
Cause every girl I want is in another man's mercedes.
But in my room my window girl.
Waits for me in prayer.
For DNA of the boy who will later betray her.

Bedroom knighthood.
It spins and it's over.
But what's that darkness.
That hangs in the corner?
I see my face in the glare.
