Penal Colony Lyrics
by Women.

They will break another.
And another.
Joined at the corners.
Faces start to blend.
Meets a sudden end.
And you're gone completely.
I know that it's hard.
To go.
You see the designer.
And the horror.
That's what you came for.
Faces start to blend.
Meet a sudden end.
And you're gone completely.
I know that it's hard.
To go.
Looking to you.
Just know how it's there.
What we can do.
Just lie on our back.
