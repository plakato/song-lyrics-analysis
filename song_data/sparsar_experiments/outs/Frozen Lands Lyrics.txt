Frozen Lands Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Frozen Lands.

I was dreaming of the frozen lands.
When we both ran across the sands.
And our legs got stuck and we both fell to the ground.

I was dreaming of the things we'd say.
I was searching for a great escape.
But the skies horizons all turned upside down.

But if you feel the will to seize it.
We could fall into the night.
Grab the want to feel and breathe with.
Cause your rush is all that I needed.

I was dreaming of the frozen lands.
Silence without the sounds.
Free from the pain of all that I have found.

I was dreaming of the things we'd say.
I was searching for the words embrace.
But the skies horizons all turned upside down.

But if you feel the will to seize it.
We could fall into the night.
Grab the want to feel and breathe with.
Cause your rush is all that I needed.

Your touch is all that I needed.
Cause your rush is all that I needed.

No sleep, closed eyes.
These tears that we've cried.
Old dreams, changed plans.
They're lost in the frozen lands.

New dawns, the deal.
No escape from what's real.
I still feel sad.
All that's left from the frozen lands.

But if you feel the will to seize it.
We could fall into the night.
Grab the want to feel and breathe with.
Cause your rush is all that I needed.

Your touch is all that I needed.
Cause your rush is all that I needed.

Cause your touch is all that I needed.
Cause your rush is all that I needed.
