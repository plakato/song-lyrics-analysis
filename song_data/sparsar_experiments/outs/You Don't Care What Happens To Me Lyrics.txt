You Don't Care What Happens To Me Lyrics
by Quebe Sisters.


Darlin', I love you so and it's kind of hard to know.
That you don't care what happens to me.
When the shadows creep through how I worry over you.
Well, you don't care what happens to me.

I wanted a true love that never would die.
But somehow it just couldn't be.
Now the tears dim my eyes every time I realize.
That you don't care what happens to me.

Darlin', let's not pretend cause our love affair must end.
You don't care what happens to me.
Now I know in my heart that I only played a part.
Cause you don't care what happens to me.

I'll try and forget you and start life anew.
I know that you're glad to be free.
Give me one goodbye kiss cause you can't go on like this.
Oh, you don't care what happens to me.
