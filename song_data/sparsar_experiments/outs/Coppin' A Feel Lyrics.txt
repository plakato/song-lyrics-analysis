Coppin' A Feel Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Coppin' coppin' coppin'.

Hey, I'm like a dog in heat.
On the road and losing sleep.
I'll meet a pretty maid uptown.
Been down every street.

So I dropped into the local bar.
Met me a girl from Kentucky.
When she looked into my eyes.
I knew I'd get lucky, hey.

Maybe I'll pass for 21.
My love you're 16.
The sight of you will blow my bed.
Forbidden fruit tempting me.
Got to get closer to you.

Time to make my move.
Buy you a drink.
And feel it out.
What've I got to lose.

But I could tell.
When she took the bait.
Tonight I got it made.
She's everything I fantasize.
And nothing more to say.

Tonight I'm coppin' a feel.
She's forbidden fruit.
You can't buy or steal.
I'll be coppin' a feel tonight.
And I really don't give a damn.
If I pay the price, no.

Ba-ba-ba-baby.
I feel the adrenaline.
Yeah, you got my hunger pain.
I wonder what you're thinkin'.
Now I'm fast again.

You're everything I wanted.
More than I bargained for.
So once you pull the trigger on my gun.
I'm comin' back for more.

I could tell.
When she took the bait.
Tonight I got it made.
She's everything I fantasize.
And there's nothing more to say.

Tonight I'm coppin' a feel.
She's forbidden fruit.
You can't buy or steal.
I'll be coppin' a feel tonight.
And I really don't give a damn.
If I pay the price.
Tonight tonight.
I'm coppin' a feel.
Around about midnight.
I'm gettin' real.

I can tell.
When she took the bait.
Tonight I had it made.
She's everything I fantasize.
And there's nothing more to say.

Tonight I'm coppin' a feel.
She's forbidden fruit.
I can't buy or steal.
I'll be copin' coppin' coppin'.
A feel tonight.
And I don't give a damn.
If I pay the price.
Tonight tonight.
I'm coppin' a feel.
She's forbidden fruit.
You can't buy or steal.

Tonight.
I don't give a damn.
I'll pay the price.
Oh.
