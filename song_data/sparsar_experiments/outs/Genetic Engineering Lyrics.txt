Genetic Engineering Lyrics
by X-Ray Spex.

Genetic engineering.
Could create an unknown life-force.
That could us exterminate.
Could create the perfect race.
As our subordinated slave.

His expertise proficiency.
Will surely dig our grave.
It's so very tempting.
Will he let us exist.
When he becomes the creator.
Will biologists resist.
Bionic man is jumping.
Through the television set.
He's about to materialise.
And guess who's coming next.
