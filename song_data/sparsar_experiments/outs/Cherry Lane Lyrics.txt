Cherry Lane Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Every night I read this novel about you.
Holding roses in the pouring rain.
But the ending's tore up, trying to hail a cab.
Think no one can read you, but I can.

Well we move into a house down on Cherry Lane.
And watch the world go by.
I'm missing a page.

I wanna be the one who walks you home.
Who walks you home tonight.
Stare into her eyes and then try and explain it.
But it's written in a language that was meant to fuck you up.
And I can never get close enough.

But I lie....
But I lie down on her pillow.
And you feel like you was going away.
Going away when you got no place to go.
But back in her arms lying on her pillow.
Curled up with a book down on Cherry Lane.
The glass it hits the floor and you're walking away.

But I wanna be the one who walks you home.
Who walks you home anyway.
Stare into her eyes and then try to explain it.
Try to explain it away.

I wanna be the one who walks you home.
Who walks you home tonight.
Stare into her eyes and then try to explain it.
Try to explain it.
But that shit just fucks you up.
And I can never get close enough.

I can never get close.
I can never get close enough.
I can never get close enough to you....

To you....
