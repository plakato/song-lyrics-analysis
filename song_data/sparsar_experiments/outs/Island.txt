Island
by Volcano Choir.


Owen, you're home.
The sun set it on to the sky.
With a long catapult.
And the salt that he put to the side.
And the tones he would push and the songs he would push to the side.
When it all went a fuck in the snow that gets pushed to the side.
Well your heart is a bush and it's talking, too, with some size.
When you already put all of the soot inside.

They were already smushed with a calm steady push to the side.
All that your heart finds.
On with your own wife.
Sign.
Up.
All.
Your.
Relatives.
Only a harbor mind.
In turpentine.

I'm the reaper bahn.
Calm the arrival.
Tear it to the night.

Heart is said, you boy.
Come and serve it with an omelette.
And you're on it.
With the carpet.
You solved it.
Said you're corporate.
Set your orbit.
Set your coffin.
Said its often.
That your old fits.
Are your old tits.
On your hard drive.
