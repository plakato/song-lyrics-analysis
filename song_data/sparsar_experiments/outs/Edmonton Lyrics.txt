Edmonton Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.


What'll I do if you never want to come back.
Sitting in the city that is always on the attack.
What'll I do if you never want me back.
Come with me, come back we'll live again.

What if I'm only satisfied when I'm at home.
Sitting in the city that'll never let me go.
What if I'm only satisfied when I'm at home.

What'll I do if you never find me again.
Sitting in a province a million miles from my friends.
What'll I do if you never want me again.
Come with me, come back we'll live again.

What if I'm only satisfied when I'm at home.
Sitting in a city that'll never let me go.
What if I'm only satisfied when I'm alone.

Late at night.
Sink your heart into mine.
I will never try.
To forget your northern lights.

Late at night.
Sync your heartbeat to mine.
I will never try.
To forget your northern lights.

Gone away again.
From this Alberta pen.
I will never try.
To forget your northern eyes.

Gone away again.
From this Alberta pen.
And I will never try.
To forget your northern eyes.

Baby then again.
Under the lights at the Leg.
And we will burn out our eyes.
Seeking out these purple nights.

Baby then again.
Under the lights at the Leg.
And we will burn out our eyes.
Seeking out these purple nights.
