Come Pick Me Up Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

When they call your name.
Will you walk right up.
With a smile on your face?
Will you cower in fear?
In your favourite sweater.
With an old love letter.

I wish you would.
I wish you would.

Come pick me up.
Take me out.
Fuck me up.
Steal my records.
Screw all my friends.
They're all full of shit.
With a smile on your face.
And then do it again.
I wish you would.

When you're walking down town.
Do you wish I was there?
Do you wish it was me?
With the windows clear.
And the mannequins eyes.
Do they all look like mine.

You know you could.
I wish you would.

Come pick me up.
Take me out.
Fuck me up.
Steal my records.
Screw all my friends.
Behind my back.
With a smile on your face.
And then do it again.
I wish you would.

I wish you'd make up my bed.
So I could make up my mind.
Try it for sleeping instead.
Maybe you'll rest sometime.
I wish I could.
I wish I could.
I wish I could.
