Beggars' Night Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Blood, blood, bloody night.
The poor stand up and fight.
Marquises, kings and all this vermin.
Hunted up in burning streets.
Fight, fight, fight with rage.
Their menials are locked up in cage.
The spirit of the rebel lives.
Determined to break free.

We stand up to break our chains.
Rulers beware.
We'll give you suffer and pain.
On beggar's night.
Riot terminates our pain.
We'll catch you in your air.
You have to pay for your blame.
On beggar's night.

Sin, sin, whip and chain.
That's the way they lived and reigned.
Too many people died in their dungeon.
Now pain's too hard if it's for their profit.
Beast, beast, go away.
No reason why you have to stay.
The wealth you squeezed out of our lives.
Will become your tomb.

We stand up to break our chains.
Rulers beware.
We'll give you suffer and pain.
On beggar's night.
Riot terminates our pain.
We'll catch you in your air.
You have to pay for your blame.
On beggar's night.
