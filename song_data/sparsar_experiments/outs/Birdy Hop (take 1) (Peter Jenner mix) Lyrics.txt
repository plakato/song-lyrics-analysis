Birdy Hop (take 1) (Peter Jenner mix) Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

Birdie hop he do 
He hop along 
A, lonely bird upon 
A window there. He he 
There he blow 
A windy snow. He knew the snow. 
I know the snow, a hoppy bird 
 
The antelope ride around the parasol 
Just to see. If he's a man enough 
To meet you in the sandpit 
On, a flying kind of sighing, 
In a meddlesome way, 
You know the way 
I see the flies, 
 
She's a little kite, the sort you think you might 
Like to fly'er and like a kite 
You, get To see her every night 
You know the way 
 
She's only paving her way. 
Hectachrome plane 
I see the flies. 
 
Birdie hop. He do he hop along 
A, lonely bird upon 
A window there. He he 
There he blow the windy. Snow. 
He know the snow, a hoppy bird 
 
A camel woke up to a polish dawn. 
Wouldn'T look to see his feet had gone, 
He wouldn't like it. 
Wouldn'T have the strength to fight it. 
I see the flies. 
 
I'm, the only bird a little third 
I lost a quarter had a yearning 
To, be earning just a dollar a day, 
And. In a way you shouldn't, like it 
Hectachrome plane, 
I, see the flies
