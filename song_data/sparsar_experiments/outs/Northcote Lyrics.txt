Northcote Lyrics
by Blood Duster.

Hey I got this funny feeling.
Stirring deep down in my balls.
I'm gonna stand in fuckin' crowds.
And rub myself against you all.

My stiffies rubbin', shuntin', and I'm.
Fucking gruntin'.
I like the nylon blouse you wear.
I'm a weirdo - or so my momma tells me.
I wanna blow chunks everywhere.

Ohhh... ride... sugar.

A wet spot in my duds I'm making.
It's all tense around my ten foot pole.
Now I'm shakin' yeah shaking.
I gotta get me some more sweet.
Bacon.
This feeling's happenin' in my.
Strides.
I'm a stroker, I'm a pleasure poker.
I'm a crowd pleasin' son of a gun.
