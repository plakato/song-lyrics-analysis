Kush n' Henny Lyrics
by Quanche.


Gomez.

I never gave up never had to set it down.
Canadian club, take a shot for Major Peggy Downes.
I think that I'm Kevin Clarke he thought he was Kevin Chiles.
I'm so high up there's no way no one could get me down.
Gimmie a quarter of kush, double shot of the Henny.
I try to keep it on hush, I don't just mingle with any.
I'm living that real life this isn't breakfast at Denny's.
Nor is it the TV, figure that out when your ready.
I'm stuck in my ways standing in front of my mirror like Please, take a look.
at just what the fuck you have made.
I hope it's something they adore, roll up the kush grab the Henny from the.
bottom drawer.

Roll up the kush grab the Henny from the bottom drawer.
Roll up the kush grab the Henny from the bottom drawer.
Roll up the kush grab the Henny from the bottom drawer.
Roll up the kush grab the Henny from the bottom drawer.

I tell that bitch that I'm a dick way before the alter.
Even though I know she sweet I do more than salt her.
I get high but I make money.
