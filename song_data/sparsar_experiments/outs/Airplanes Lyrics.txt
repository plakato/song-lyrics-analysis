Airplanes Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


Most of my life I sat on my hands. I don't make a sound 
Getting it right. I made all my plans lost, never found 
Your eyes. Your smile can light up the night night 
Embers and neon signs paint up our sky sky 
 
Airplanes cut through the clouds 
Like angels can fly, we'll never die. 
Sirens cut through the night. 
Like screams set on fire rising up higher 
I've, got something to prove nothing to lose 
In this city in this city, woah, 
Oooh-ooooh-oooh-oooh, 
, 
, Luke,
