#9 Dream Lyrics
by A-ha.

So long ago.
Was it in a dream?
Was it just a dream?
Oh, I know, yes, I know.
It seemed so very real.
Seemed so real to me.
Took a walk down the street.
Through the heat whispered trees.
I thought I could hear.
Hear.
Hear.
Hear.
Somebody calls out my name.
Two spirits dancing so strange.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.

Dream, dream away.
Magic in the air.
Was magic in the air?
I believe, yes, I believe.
More I cannot say.
What more can I say?
On a river of sound.
Through the mirror go round.
Round.
I thought I could feel.
Feel.
Feel.
Feel.
Music touching my soul.
Something warm, sudden cold.
The spirit dance was unfolding.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.

#9 Dream.
