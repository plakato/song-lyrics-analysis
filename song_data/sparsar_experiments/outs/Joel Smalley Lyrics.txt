Joel Smalley Lyrics
by Yung Peen & The Sacc.

Monologue!

Uh, Peen and the Sacc, yeah that's important ho.
Gotta stay strapped, just in case, cause ya never know.
Never fall back, like the King's hairline.
Think your girl wants your dick?
Weird she's always mine.
And just take your time.
No need to rush.
I've committed crimes, and we ain't call the fuzz.
Now we live in clubs.
Stackin that paper.
Told ya the last time had consent didn't rape her.
Got that BOMD flow, take you back in time.
When I fucked your mom, and that your mine.
Yeah I'm your daddy, Nick Cage.
Fuck your legs off, now you a mermaid.
Disney bitch!
Under the sea.
Leave your house unlocked, and you gon see me.
When you get back, you gon find a suprise.
Your daughter upstairs has just been sodomized.
Check your cameras, and you'll see.
Your boy the Sacc on the TV screen.
I mean I'm not gonna not get your bitch to call me.
Cause all the hoes want that Joel Smalley.

Joel Smalley bitch x10.
When does he come back in?

Yo Pierce where you at?
All my bitches love it.
Gettin on my Duckett.
Running back your girl told your momma to suck it.
Pullin 5 bad bitches like your boy zmbounce.
Make about a hunnit when I'm movin an ounce.
Bustin a slug or 2 just to gimme a laugh.
I ain't even call ya bitch but I sneak in the back.
The Fed's tryna ask Yo you still sellin crack?
I'm like yeah, what ya, know about that.
Ya sister tryna flash me.
Lookin like a track meet.
Bitches know the cash be, that was the last beat.
I never have a threesome without a Dash beat.
And your first beef with me will be your last Steve.
610, straight outta Pittsburgh.

Joel Smalley bitch x10.
