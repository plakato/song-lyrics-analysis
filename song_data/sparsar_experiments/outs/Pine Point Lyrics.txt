Pine Point Lyrics
by Pup.

Oh in Pine Point where I was born
Roads are all overgrown
No: one's lived there for years
The town was never the same
The mine was closed. In'88
Everyone disappeared

In Pine Point ,'86
My older brother died when we were kids
His. Best friend was wasted at the wheel

Oh in Pine Point. Nothing but memories
The abandoned cemetery
Where. We buried our family

And. I hope you know what you're doing
Up in Pine Point
Where I kept my eye on the prize
And it was you
It was you
Oh in Pine Point
Where. I kept my eye on the prize and it was you
It was you

Oh in Pine Point
It's deteriorating
And your memory started fading
So. You called to let me know
You said it seems like forever
Since we've seen each other
Where. Does the time go 

And. I said
I hope you know
What you're doing
In Pine Point
In, the house. We grew up. In
You said the room you were born. In
It was just like you left it

Oh in Pine Point
Where. I kept my eye on the prize
And. It was you
It was you
Oh in Pine Point
Where. I kept my eye on the prize and it was you
It was you

I hope you know
I hope you know what you're doing after all
I hope that you know

I hope you know
I hope you know
What you're doing after all
I hope that you know
What you're doing
