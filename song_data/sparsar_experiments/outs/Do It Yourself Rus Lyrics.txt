Do It Yourself Rus Lyrics
by Rustlah.

He was birthed with a curse.
Fantastic ability to change his mask.
Generate Skins from within.
Six faces, old six sided ugly was playing with putty.
Making faces before five.
His fourth eye, dead, dripping dark dye.
Down the murky side of whatever perfect life he would interpret for the night.
Virgin like tight, to the worlds and their plights.
He'd switch skins to fit in, they called him Rustlah Sixskins.
Big thin, witch kin, spinning yarns like Stilskin by the million.
For anybody that feels him.
He made a living as a speaker for the dead, misled, thizz heads.
Whose bones he kept underneath his bed.
At dawn, he morphed, another mask on with a bright smile.
From years of braces, the man with many faces.
Trading lives like trading places.
His mind a churning eddy, murphy bedding burning through the friendly fire.
Dunny need money and funding to start running.
So his implant hit a big flash like GET CASH.
After work he wear a pig mask and sip a big flask.

Followed them pinky DIY no gimmick interests down every path until he finished.

A duffel bag filled with Rustlah masks.
Backseat driver with six voices telling him its all right before the underpass.
Overkill, leave all the hunters gassed over ill.
Summer's passed the winter will get colder still.
He duck, broke a bill, dipped a top a hellish hill, metal filled.
A deadly deal signed in turn with seven seals.
Opened portals out of Portland to unpopulated planets planning.
Painting perfect people picture them exactly where they're standing.
Ants under his micro glass, he laughs behind his Michael mask,.
You are just like me, recycled trash left behind at Bible class, blessed.
To find a typo's task, press rewind watch life go back..
Stories told in camera phone, structured like a stanza poem.
Watching all the ants go home,he was left alone.
A stepping stone to where the jesters go to dance and moan.
