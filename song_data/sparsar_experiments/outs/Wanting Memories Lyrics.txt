Wanting Memories Lyrics
by Sweet Honey In The Rock.


I am sitting here wanting memories to teach me.
To see the beauty in the world.
Through my own eyes.

You used to rock me in the cradle of your arms.
You said you'd hold me.
'Til the pains of life were gone.
You said you'd comfort me in times like these.
And now I need you.
Now I need you, and you are gone.

I am sitting here wanting memories to teach me.
To see the beauty in the world.
Through my own eyes.
Since you've gone and left me.
There's been so little beauty.
But I know I saw it clearly through your eyes.

Now the world outside is such a cold and bitter place.
Here inside I have few things that will console.
And when I try to hear your voice.
Above the storms of life.
Then I remember.
All the things that I was told.

I am sitting here wanting memories to teach me.
To see the beauty in the world.
Through my own eyes.

I think on the things that made me feel.
So wonderful when I was young.
I think on the things that made me laugh.
Made me dance, made me sing.
I think on the things that made me.
Grow into a being full of pride.
I think on these things.
For they are true.

I am sitting here wanting memories to teach me.
To see the beauty in the world.
Through my own eyes.
I thought that you were gone.
But now I know you're with me.
You are the voice that whispers all I need to hear.

I know a please, a thank you.
And a smile will take me far.
I know that I am you and you are me and we are one.
I know that who I am is.
Numbered in each grain of sand.
I know that I've been blessed.
Again and over again.

I am sitting here wanting memories to teach me.
To see the beauty in the world.
Through my own eyes.
