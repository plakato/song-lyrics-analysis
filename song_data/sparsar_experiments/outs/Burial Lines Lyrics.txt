Burial Lines Lyrics
by Unearth.

This cornerstone.
A Testament of worth.
With razored claws that freeze the hands of delusion.
Force feed a dream in a state of pure unrest.
This cornerstone lines the stars never resting.
No one can take it away.
A life unresting.
No one can take it away.
I'll defend my Kingdom.
No one can take it away.
Force feed this dream until I drown.
No one can take it away.
Now die my will unconquered.
Through the bloodshed burials lines.
A darkness waits for the night to come.
Blood spilled while the watchers fall.
Now face to face to defend my kingdom.
With razored claws that freeze the hands of delusion.
Not again I won't let this slip through my fingers.
I'll keep running through.
I've found my home lives at the Rivers Edge.
I'll keep rushing through.
Through the bloodshed burial lines.
Face to face I defend my Kingdom.
Face to Face.
