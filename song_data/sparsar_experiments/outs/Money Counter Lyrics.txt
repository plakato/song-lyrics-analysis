Produced by Charlie Heat.

Money counter sound like a chopper.
Man ain't no price on my neck, cause everything right here cuh.
Tryna get to this check, might have to get shit through cuh.
Admit that I might love these hoes, but don't let em hold nothin'.
I mean she might hold the clip but nigga that about it.
Lord knows I don't trust her.
Faded with the endings off river, balling since the motherfucking tipoff.
WhiteY KK, nigga pull his own.
zipper.
Hit the Migo cause I'm tryna make.
a pick up.
Look so good might try to fuck a model.
Feel so good might try to hit his sister.
Nigga so drunk off gin and the love.
Imma have a real fucking hard time thinking.
She smashing her homies, I think that glass is a Rolex.
That Phantom is phony, you lied.
One and the only, feel how you want me.
I'm rolling while rolling and smoking the pine.
That clip cost more than your lethal.
Don't know her but I know that she a freak though.
Fucked her once on the trunk of the dump.
After that didn't call for a week though.

Money counter sound like a chopper x2.

I ball with the work, I feel like I'm Dirk.
I pass like I'm Nash and I think that I'm Kobe.
I feel like I'm Wilt, high as a stilt.
Popping these pills, like a wheel I been rolling.

Prescription encoded, my competition is 40.
All of my blunts presidential, they voted.
Drugs are essential, I'm glad that you noticed.

Missed the middleman, I ain't looking for the coke.
Echo on the metro, feeling like I'm ?
Hot boy, BG, hit it then I'm gone.
Day one I'm on it, you knew from the jump.
Youngins like Reebok, they stay with the pump.
Evil kneevil, I'm trying to stunt.
I'm driving while working and serving them ones like.
