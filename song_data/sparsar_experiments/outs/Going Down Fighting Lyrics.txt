Going Down Fighting Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Come on, you're the one that brought us here, I can't believe what you say,.
tell me you're kidding.
Hell no, you're not gonna leave us stranded here, no way, you've ruined.
everything.
Can't you see we're lost without you, though we hate to say.
There's so much at cost; you know it's true, and you can only take.

Oh, we've heard it all before, and now we'll hear it once again.
Take your cut and go, leave us out in the cold, you can never get away, not.
this time.

Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.

If you never want us to return again that's fine with me, not gonna stand for.
thievery.
I know, you probably think that you're gonna get away with your little game,.
but rules are made for breaking.
Can't you see we're lost.
There's so much at cost.

Oh we've heard it all before, and now we'll hear it once again.
Stop this lying to yourself.
You're crying to an empty floor, and we are not to blame.
Stop denying.

Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
Going down fighting.
