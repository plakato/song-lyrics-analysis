Earth Bound Lyrics
by X-Clan.

Funk upon a time.
In the days of vanglorious.
The tri-dimensional houses of energy.
Released the original powers.
To the translators of the interplanetary funk code.
Funkin religion, funkin lesson.
Key bearers, funkin to the East.
Earth bound.

Professor X.
Mmmm.
We are messengers, of Ra.
Whispering the secrets of the ages.
Vanglorious! This is protected.
By the red, the black, and the green.
With a KEY! SISSSSSY!

Brother J.
What is.. we are...
Dum-diddy-dum to the God's new drum.
Devils run, here comes the sun.
Brothers travel for ages.
Scroll and stake from planet to planet.
I take a ride on the cosmos.
The utmost toast of my raft.
Now mortals want a dose of the voice of key.
With the bass of the great war chant.
So now it's on to the garden at a million vibes a second.
The pyramid tries to beckon.
The sands of time, survive the flood.
The bricks of blood, the house of the heart.
On the tri-dimensional level.
On to balance with the feather.
Funkin' lesson, vibes to earth, from Ra on to Jeb.

The abyss to the earth to the waters.
Vanglorious sound on the rain comin' down.
Verbalizer with scroll, earth bound.

Professor X.
I am, the blood of the pharaohs.
The spear bearers, the elephant riders.
The everlasting conquerors.
I AM, the original power of blackness.
The strength exampled, in our people as a whole.
I am the voice of unearthly soil.
Earth bound, by will of the Creator.

Brother J.

Great void, the funk code plane.
Going back to the ending, the beginning.
Degrees ever spinning, in a world of divisibles.
Black is black and before that original.
Great pyramids served as tomb, but power;.
Child in the womb.
I awaken to raise the flag, ahh, from the zero.
War, zoom, devils, doomed.
Eternal souls, living as those who are chose.
To live for the nose.
My boots bear soil, in respect of the elders toiled.
Bearskin rug, walk in flames, vultures swoop on the boiled.
I free my mind and my spirit follows.
I bring words of the wise.
Coming to the earth on the likes of rafts.
Coming from the moon to the Nile, earth bound.

Professor X.
In the land beneath, I come knowing the earth bends over.
Wrapped it's legs around darkness.
And black waters both glide.

Brother J.
Let's take a trip through space, without no suit.
I'm an Afronaut, I'm the original traveller, and unraveller.
Of all mysteries, I touched the.
world like a child plays tag.
Speak the code then depart upon raft.
Over moon with the chants of zoom, who are you?
You wonder, forever.
Never never, a million years, key bearer.
The cosmic storm, illogical coming of chaos.
Again, earth dweller comprehend.
Religion on wax.
The facts of the living, the phoenix flies.
Wings scrape the sky.
And surveys the eyes of two, zoom.
On to the temple, zoom.
Mortals fears, brothers tears, war is declared, zoom.
Disrupting the devils convention.
Paved in hell are the gravest intentions.
But in my home devils burn, think about it.
Til a Brother returns, to Zod.

Professor X.
I have come like a priest in panther skin.
Having crossed the Nile by boat.
Having come through the gap in the mountain.
Having walked like , restless.
Like a rabbit from the depth of his hutch.
Blinking at light, I have come.
The mission, the nine.
The destination, the crossroads.
And then...
