Attack of The Clones Lyrics
by Uno Hype.


Yeah.
Know what I'm sayin dog a lot a niggas wanna you know.
Its like everyday I meet a new rapper an shit ya feel me.
Like everybody wanna be like everybody else you know.
That shit just kinda yeah it like gets to me.
Like I don't really like that shit at all dog.
Cuz its like niggas wanna be other niggas and shit.
Like homie be your fuckin self dog like.
You know what I'm sayin?
Fuck the hype.

One day you should grow into your own.
Be your own person, never be a clone.
I know you dudes will so I'm headed to the throne.
I'm heavely alone check the method with the poems.
Stop protectin ya dome cuz one day you poppin.
And the next you gon same with these broads.
That got left alone I'm never disrespectin so check the tone.
Plus my heart beat to the metronome.
Listen how it move with the rhythem.
Remain on op so I'm never slippin.
Dude gotta be kiddin work ethic crazy you gotta be persistant.
And that's how it is when you get it ideas start clickin.
Clock stop tickin put your focus on the kid that's spittin.
A kid with the dream they couldn't picture my vision.
Now these niggas listen but now they all get it.
Homie you should do your own thing.
They ain't fuckin with me homie in my domain.
Is whatever you niggas getting dotcom ain't.
Fuckin with you dog and these niggas know the whole game.
Shit, that's how it is now.
I ain't fuckin with you boy but I'm never backing down.
How many times have you felt the world hate you.
Everybodys against only a couple stay true.
I was the homie that you came to.
Never tried to change you.
Over the years now look what it came to.
Askin what this fame a do.
Your doubt was the reason so I blamed you.
I just had business to attend to.
Now these niggas actin all strange dude.
Like nigga what the fame do.
Fuck the hype na that shit jus gonna change who.
