Nuclear (Hands Up) Lyrics
by Zomboy.

Whoa!
Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!

Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air.
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air-a.
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air.
It's a bomb in the walk just like a Nu-clear.

Come on, and let me see your hands in the air.
With your air days when you jump off on your chair.
Get your freak on a-like ya don' care-a.
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air.

COME ON!

Whoa!
Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!

COME ON!

Whoa!
Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!

Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air.
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air-a.
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air.
It's a bomb in the walk just like a Nu-clear.

Come on, and let me see your hands in the air.
With your air days when you jump off on your chair.
Get your freak on a-like ya don' care-a.
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air.

COME ON!

Come on....

Come on....

Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air.
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air-a.
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air.
It's a bomb in the walk just like a Nu-clear.

Come on, and let me see your hands in the air.
With your air days when you jump off on your chair.
Get your freak on a-like ya don' care.
Lemme see ya, lemme see ya, lemme see ya, lemme see ya.
