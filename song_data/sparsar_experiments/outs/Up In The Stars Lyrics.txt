Up In The Stars Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

Look in these eyes.
We know each other like our own skin and bones.
We know the scars.
How they got where they are, in places no one else knows.

If you call this love, then show me some feeling.
And if it all goes numb, just keep on breathing.

I'll watch you falling from me.
When you hit the ground, maybe you'll see.
The only way to fall is down.
I'll be up in the stars.
But I'll be anywhere you are.
Just say you need me and I'll come down.

We'll never know, We'll never ever know if you just let it go.

If it comes undone, then tie up your loose ends.
When the colors run, then all of the shapes blend.
Oh, you know there's still a ways to go, so don't start retreating.
No, you just gotta take it slow.
When you're lost and all out of breath just call and I'll come running baby.

I'll watch you falling from me.
When you hit the ground maybe you'll see.
The only way to fall is down.
And I'll be up in the stars.
But I'll be anywhere you are.
Just say you need me and I'll come down.

The days go by....
