D'Angelo Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.

When you the one the world look at.
When you the one than never knew you was the one until the world put that.
Title on you, I been on this, Micheal Jordan.
Way way before the jumpman came.

I took y'all joy I know how sadness feels.
From inside out I know how bad its been.

From now on when I leave town the whole squad come with.

Never try to flex for a blog post.
