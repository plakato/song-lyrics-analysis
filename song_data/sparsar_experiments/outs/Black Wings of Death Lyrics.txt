Black Wings of Death Lyrics
by Running Wild.

The churchbell of doom is tolling.
The angel of death is near.
The ghost with cowl and the sickle.
Spreading terror and fear.

He's taking your breath.
He's twisting your spine.
He poisons your soul and.
He poisons your mind.

Grim reaper will gather in his seed.
Blood will splatter his path.
A phantom that's sealing your doom.
The damned's foreboding of death.

He's taking your breath.
He's twisting your spine.
He poisons your soul and.
He poisons your mind.

Riding high on the black wings of death.
Like a nightmare that choking your breath.
Like the terror that blackens your soul.
It's the dream where you fall on a six foot deep hole.

The dice of life are falling.
The weak and the poor will lose.
The rich in their ivory towers.
Can't fell that their head's in the noose.
No chance to talk him round.
The black death is spreading its wings.
He's the Jonah of unbridled fear.
The pain to beggars and kings.

He's taking your breath.
He's twisting your spine.
He poisons your soul and.
He poisons your mind.

Riding high on the black wings of death.
Like a nightmare that choking your breath.
Like the terror that blackens your soul.
It's the dream where you fall on a six foot deep hole.

Riding high on the black wings of death.
Like a nightmare that choking your breath.
Like the terror that blackens your soul.
It's the dream where you fall on a six foot deep hole.
