Hope In The Mirror Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

No hope in the mirror.
Breaking you up.
The voice from inside.
Says never enough.

No hope in the mirror.
Breaking you up.
The voice from inside.
Says never enough.

No transformation.
Fears i'm accepting.
Wanting for something.
Losing too much.

Hope in the mirror.
Breaking you up.
The voice from inside.
Says enough.

No hope in the mirror.
Breaking you up.
The voice from inside.
Says never enough.

Hope in the mirror.
Voice inside.
Hope in the mirror.
Voice inside.

Hope in the mirror.
Breaking you up.
The voice from inside.
Says enough.
