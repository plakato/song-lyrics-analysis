Let's Get Love Tonight Lyrics
by ViZion.


Yeaaa im feeling so goood.
Let's get love tonight.
Yea let's get love.
Let's get love tonight.
Here we go.

Who's got the vodka I've got the swishers.
Who's clubbing with us?
High heels and killer figures.
These girls just pose for the pictures.
We're going vicious.
Like all night long.
One day we'll miss this.
So bring more jager bombs.

We're living our life and we won't change.
Fly up in the spot, like an aeroplane.
And we're burning up, like it's propone.
Yea I'm living my life, living my life.

Raise the cup up.
Sip the potion.
Turn the love up.
And feel the moment.
Yea it's just us.
And I don't know your name.
Lights around us.
We're going up again.

Let's get love tonight.
Let's get love tonight.

We're living our life and we won't change.
Fly up in the spot, like an aeroplane.
And we're burning up, like it's propone.
Yea I'm living my life, living my life.

Yea yea.
Yea yea.

Let love, come shining in.
Let love, come shining in.
Let love, come shining in.
Let love.
Let love, come shining in.
Let love, come shining in.
Let love, come shining in.
Let love, come shining in.

Who's got the vodka I've got the swishers.
Whos clubbing with us?
High heels and killer figures.
These girls just pose for the pictures.
We're going vicious.
Like all night long.
One day we'll miss this.
One day we'll miss this.

Let's get love tonight.
Let's get love tonight.
Let's get love tonight.
Let's get love tonight.
Let's get love tonight.
Let's get love tonight.
