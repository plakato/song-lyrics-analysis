Black Hole Lyrics
by 3OH!3.

Hello yeah it's me again – no homo sapien.
I'm an ancient alien – was sent to take your women.
You could say we're winning – more than Charlie Sheen is.
And don't get mad at me because your girl was on my dick.
You know that we're rocking the computer – Steven Hawking.
And if that bitch hangs up on me again you know I'm walkin…
Like Christopher – never catch me kissin on the mistletoe cause this is.
missile crisis time to light em up – go.

Cold woman – she sucked me in…
No air – and I'll never see the light again…

I fell into a black hole…

Don't get angry bird like I just hopped out the pig pen.
I'm used to havin hands on me – yeah you can call me Big Ben.
It's time to get stupid – yeah it's time to get Kardashian.
So pour that whiskey deep and hand that motherfucking flask again.
You're a massive black hole – and you say that I'm the asshole.
When I saw you at the last show – you were on me like a shadow.
Up the creek, no paddle – tell my Mommy and my Dad oh I ain't never comin back.
She sucked me in a black hole.

Cold woman – she sucked me in…
No air – and I'll never see the light again…

I fell into a black hole…
Play.
