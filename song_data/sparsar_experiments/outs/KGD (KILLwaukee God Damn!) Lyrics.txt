KGD (KILLwaukee God Damn!) Lyrics
by Vivafidel & Gat Turner.

Jeremiah Wright's sermon And the United States of America government when
it came to treating her citizens of Indian decent fairly. She failed. She put
them on reservations. When it came to treating her citizens of Japanese decent
fairly. She failed. She put them in internment prison camps. When it came to
treating. Her citizens of African, decent fairly America failed. She put them
in chains.. The government put them in slave quarters, put them on auction
blocks, put them in cotton fields. Put them in inferior schools. Put them in
substandard, housing put them in scientific experiments, put them in the
lowest, paying jobs. Put them outside the equal protection of the law kept
them out of their racist bastions, of higher education and locked them, into
position of hopelessness and helplessness.. The government gives them the
drugs, builds, bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us. To
Sing “God Bless America.”; No, no no., Not “God Bless America”.
