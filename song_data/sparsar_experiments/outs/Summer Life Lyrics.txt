Summer Life Lyrics
by YULTRON.

Hey yo pass that weed, man.
Uh.
L.A., what up? Vegas what up?
It's your boy Yultron, YG ?

Yeah, wish everyday was the summer time.
Waking up in afternoons baby this is slumber time.
Girls getting tan skin looking super fine.
Champagne sipping like a boss, king cooper style.
Snap backs with backpacks, still want to fall.
These packer...swisher sweets puffing with the homies.
Smoke a whole ounce, passing out slowly.
Summer time girls, never living lonely.
Think they know me, saying that they see me change.
Well if you think I'm dumb bitch, you can give me brain.
You can call me soccer pro, always keep the game.
Swag daddy with the ladies, think that be my second name.
Remember when I met you at the mall that.
Summer you was all that, wonder if you call back?
Fall in love once, but we never fall back.
Memories of me and you bring that summer life back like.

Summer time and the living's easy.
Sipping on my drink, smoking all of that weed.
Sleeping all day, party all night.
Kicking back just tryna get my buzz like.

Yo, dear summer, I don't love them.
I put that on my life, I just wanna fuck em.
I just wanna hit the scene, breath smell like Listerine.
Oh that's your man girl, that nigga's a mystery.
My girl shop at Tiffany's I shop at Fairfax.
My chain cost 6 figures nigga, don't come near that.
My shit ain't near wild, I'm like above average.
Thug is my bad habit, girl fuck with me.
Summertime weather, I'll be with whatever.
I'll be with whatever like I don't know no better.
Yeah it's hot in the hood, fuck snitches.
I just wanna, I just wanna fuck bitches.
Cali living, gladly sipping.
I like it straight, I don't mix it.
Ever left the one you love for the one you like.
Yeah that's some cold shit right, well I blame it on the summertime.

Adios motherfucker, sitting drunk out by the pool.
Shawty looking bad but my plan is just to keep it cool.
Rolling up a doob, kick it in cloud 9.
Man, wish everyday was the summertime.
