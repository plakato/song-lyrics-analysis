Apple For A Brain Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

An apple for a brain.
A bee for a best man.
A panda is yourself.
And you holding Butter's hand.
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

When and why is it us?
Bearing thy cross of shame.

Lu lu lu lu lu.
Lu lu lu lu lu.
Sha la la la la la la.
Sha la la la la la la.

So hideous for a boy.
So hideous on a boy.
I wanted to forget.
So ugly for a boy.

Dispraise for what i am.
A cartoon with no friends.
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

Lu lu lu lu lu.
Lu lu lu lu lu.
Sha la la la la la la.
Sha la la la la la la.

When and why is it us?
Bearing thy cross of shame.
So hideous for a boy.
So hideous on a boy.
I wanted to forget.
Pandapple spoke to me.
Pandapple called my name.
So ugly for a boy.
