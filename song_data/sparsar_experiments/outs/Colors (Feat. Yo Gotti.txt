Colors (Feat. Yo Gotti
by 5.

I look around.
As far as I can see.
The colors of the world.
Are waiting for me.

Blue for the sky.
Green for the trees.
Yellow for the sun.
Orange autumn leaves.

If I had to choose one color.
A color just for me.
I'd have to take them all.
Take them all you see.

And I'd be living in a rainbow.
Colors everywhere.
Colors all around me.
And no one has a care, colors everywhere.
Let's go!

If I had wings of gold.
I'd fly way up high.
I'd fly through the rainbow.
The colors, the sky.

Flying through the red.
Diving in the blue.
Sliding down the yellow.
To be next to you.

If I had to choose one color.
A color just for me.
I'd have to take them all.
Take them all you see.

And I'll be living in a rainbow.
Colors everywhere.
Colors all around me.
And no one has a care.

And I'll be living in a rainbow.
Colors everywhere.
Colors all around me.
And no one has a care, colors everywhere.
Let's go.

Living in a rainbow.
Living in a rainbow.
Living in a rainbow.
Living in a rainbow.
