Dark And Long (dark Train Mix) Lyrics
by Underworld.

Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead, long.
Kiss you, kiss you dark &amp; long.
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead.
Thunder, thunder, lightning.
Thunder thunder, lightning ahead.
Now I kiss you dark &amp; long.
Thunder thunder, lightning ahead, long.
Kiss you, kiss you dark &amp; long, long.
Me I'm just a waitress she said.
I went and bought a new head she said.
I look at you I believe in you she said.
Screaming into the eye of the lens.
I want to smash it up, I want to break it down.
I want a wall of tears to wash away.
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead.
Thunder, thunder, lightning.
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead.
Now I kiss you dark &amp; long.
Filled with tainted girls and motel frills.
What a laugh, you was done up there mate.
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead.
I could kiss you dark &amp; long.
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead.
Now I kiss you dark &amp; long.
Shout your love, the stars are black.
The church is sweet, my skin is hot.
Thunder, thunder lightning ahead.
Now I kiss you dark &amp; long, shout your love.
