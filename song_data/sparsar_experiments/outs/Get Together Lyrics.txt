Get Together Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.

= woman's line.

Cellphone ringing.
Voice in background: Yo Vernon! Yo nigga, get the phone!

Thrill Da Playa.
Hello?
Playin' tetherball.
And eatin' cream out the middle of some Oreos.
I meant to call you back last night.
But I was watchin a video of an Evander Holyfield fight.
Next time you see your friend Michelle.
Tell her if she ain't fake, one of my boys wanna yell.
Anyway, that's enough of that.

Oh, now you wanna play the switcheroo?
Well call me back when you gon' let me hit the coochy-coo.
Just because I play the Babyface.
Don't mean that I'm a punk that won't hang up in a lady's face.
Oh, I thought you might change your mind.
Cause a fella like myself, I must admit, is hard to find.
You coulda stuck with your ex-man.
Just to chit-chat and talk about wedding plans.
Cause I ain't gonna talk respectfully.
I talk reality, and how we can fulfill your needs sexually.
The kinda stuff that'll make you wonder.
And callin' me is cheaper than a 976 number.
And I ain't tryin' to run game.
I belong to you, so I ain't tryin' to prove a damn thing!
So we can do whatever, but now, all I.
Wanna know is, when is we gon' get together?

I hope that we can get together soon.

Thrill Da Playa.
So when you gonna let me get ya hot?
We'll get some wine, food, and a room at the Mariott.
What? Filet mignon and Parignon?
Well I was thinkin' more Dom and lime potato chips and.
Baby, I ain't bein' cheap!
But if we gon' be workin' out, we don't need to have too much to eat.
I'm sure you need some work on your thighs.
And for sure my third leg could use a little exercise.
Hold on a second, hon ---.
{speaking off the phone}.
Man, can't you see I'm on the phone, runnin' game, tryin' to get me some?
What? If you're gonna get perverty.
Then make sure you bring back a freaky-deaky friend for me!
{he comes back on the phone}.
I'm back, baby, sorry 'bout that thing.
But my boys let me know I was next on the cellular game.
But anyway, onto bigger things, and better things.
Like kitty-cat and ding-a-ling.
I really hope you're hearing me, and at the same time.
I hope you ain't gettin' the wrong idea of me.
I'd love to take you to a picture show.
But it's cheaper to stay home and watch it all on HBO.
Cause if we home and we take it.
We'll get the hot-buttered corn, and watch the movie naked.
So baby, let's go to my room.
And I hope we can get together real soon.
