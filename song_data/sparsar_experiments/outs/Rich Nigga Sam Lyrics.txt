Rich Nigga Sam Lyrics
by Yung Tapharrell.


I'm sat here counting paper,.
As long as I'm in the studio.
The streets gonna be safer, snitching never, dope gang forever.
I'm loyal to my niggas.
They are the ones that are break the bread with.
They wonder about my net worth.
I got a crib, a yacht and a main bitch just to stay with.
Now I'm in the top five best rappers, DOA.
If niggas wanna play, they definitely gonna pay.
Now everybody wanna know where I stay.
So I say.

Girls that never liked me, they are the same ones that wanna hang out more.
Cause they know a nigga got a gallardo with 2 doors.
A penthouse with no whores.
Bodyguard be opening doors.
As I come through, like Iam lizzy.
Talking is still easy.
Rapping is a task.
Pardon me if I peform in a mask.
But I be on my dope shit.
You be on your wack shit.
Tripple six nigga that's who they think I'm with.
Coz I'm getting 6 figures every tour.

In my tour bus.
Counting Money.
Taph, Listen to me.
You are not rich nigga Sam.
You are broke nigga Taph.
Stop playing with your mind.
Stop playing yourself.
Face yourself.
