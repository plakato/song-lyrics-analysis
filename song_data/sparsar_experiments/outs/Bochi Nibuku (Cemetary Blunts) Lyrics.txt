Bochi Nibuku (Cemetary Blunts) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Got a pack full of wraps and a whole lot of dope to roll tonight.
I'mma take your bitch back to the back of the Lack', let me hold her tight.
All the windows down, riding 'round on your side of town.
Tray full of that blunt ash, got a trunk stuffed with them fucking pounds.
Riding 'round, riding 'round.
Rain falling, it's coming down.
Pinky ring go bling bling but my switchblade don't make a sound.
I'm swervin', just servin'.
These bitches call like it's urgent.
Your girl say that she nervous.
So she popped a pill now she twerkin'.
She bad, and I'm good.
Find me swangin' around my hood.
Rolling Backwoods, back to back, don't get it misunderstood.
She bad, and I'm good.
Find me swangin' around my hood.
Rolling Backwoods, back to back, don't get it misunderstood.

I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'.

I'm sitting in a chair rolling up some weed.
I don't give a fuck about what you need.
All I care about is me and me, and my W.E.E.D.
Come fuck with me but don't fuck with me.
If you touch me I'll turn ugly.
And if she ugly, then she ain't with me.
I'mma keep it real till I D.I.E.
I'm posted with the Bones, carcasses around my home.
Mane I like to be alone, I'm too rare to be a clone.
I ain't human nigga, move on.
Before I remix your dome.
Airplane mode stay on my phone, bitch I won't never answer my phone.
