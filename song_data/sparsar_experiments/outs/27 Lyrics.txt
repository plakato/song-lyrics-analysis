It's starting to feel like the more that I climb.
Is actually just the farther I'll fall.
I'm lost and it's all.
Cause I'm trying to spark a fire.
Fuck forgot a lighter.
Plus everyone wants to be stalling the thaw.
That's hardly at all a good excuse.
For loosing to new improved looney tunes.
That claim that their bars are the raw-est.
Maybe the weed that's given me plausible cause.
To be an enemy to any lyrically conquerer of song.
Like Chris Brown I can kill it stomping the yard.
But this round I'm sitting still in ponder and awe.
At that, the reality is, the fatalities.
Are happening now to the kids.
Whom cower in fear cause they can't stand out or be weird.
Without being told down by their peers.
And called foul nouns and adjectives.
It's so sad, wanna go back.
But somethings allowing me to just blow past.
I know that, if we hold fast.
Towards the idea of peace we're soar at last.
