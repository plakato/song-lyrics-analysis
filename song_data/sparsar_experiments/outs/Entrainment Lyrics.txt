Entrainment Lyrics
by Qrebel.

The boy didn't cry: wolf: the wolf howled sheep/
While foul pigs pointed barking dogs at suspect cats. In the streets/
For, a peep from the horse's mouth on the cash cow's, whereabouts/
While Wall St. monkeys run around like chickens with their heads cut. Off/
And. The courthouse is just the chopping block/
In a world where justice is served: piping, hot or ice cold/
I use this heart that turned into stone to write my black list on/
And. It'S been growing since more and more liars and thieves are/
Crossing the thin line between right and wrong/
I'm. Once bitten and twice shy, so once you join my bad side/
There, aren't many roads for anybody to ride back home/
This, isn't a diss song, just real rap/
From, a warm heart that refuses to turn cold for those faking jax/

Like. I said before keep your word bond or don't even bother breaking the
silence/
Still. I can see them fix their lips to decieve. Again
Or, expose their teeth to bite the hand that fed them/

Just, sharing some wisdom and throwing caution to the wind/

Stop searching for the treasure anywhere but within/
Is. Where and how I begin, this piece of the letter/
I believe in a fair shake whenever two hands meet/
And still seek peace at every place. I am/
Even, though, that's where I'll always be/
Gave some people the benefit of the doubt/
Later found out their were just about benefits/
Goes to show who's really a true friend in the end/
I keep my wits about me from the get-go/
Convinced. This, too shall pass like it already. Happened/
