Something Unusual Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Something Unusual.

When the time moves faster than a bullet from a gun.
When we're secretly unraveling, coming undone.
When you're looking all around but you just don't see.
Why won't you lay down your little heart for me?

We'd be something out of this world, never seen before.
I feel there's a look in your eye.
A silent cry to be something unusual.
To be something unusual.

Like a sunset etched right across your face.
Won't you paint me the colors of a warm embrace?
And I know that you're nervous - I'm feeling it too.
But to give us a shot is the least you could do.

We'd be something out of this world, never seen before.
I feel that there's a look in your eye.
A silent cry to be something unusual.
To be something unusual.

Why won't you lay down your little heart for me?
Come on and lay down your little heart for me.
Heart, heart, heart for me.

Oh, oh, oh oh.
Oh, oh, oh oh.
To be something unusual.

Oh, oh, oh oh.
Oh, oh, oh oh.
To be something unusual.
