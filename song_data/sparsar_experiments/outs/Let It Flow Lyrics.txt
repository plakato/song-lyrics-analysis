Let It Flow Lyrics
by The Union.

Open up a bag of 20/20 vision then I close my eyes.
The animation of my senses helps me see your image in the sky.
We can feel the pleasures of the grain.
If you want to come in from the rain.
Drifting through an open womb of colors that make me want to sleep.
Awakening and to my surprise, you're lying next to me.
We can hear the song the ocean sings.
Holy water baptize me from sin.
I'm letting go, let it flow, we can be high again.
Just let it go, feel the flow, a journey that never ends.
The invitation, to ride a shining star tonight.
Take my hand and we can fly away.
Celebration of this moment of this life.
There will be a better way.
The invitation, to ride a shining star tonight.
Take my hand, and we can fly away.
Celebration of this moment of this life there will be a better way.
