Disconnected Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


Life's a tangled web.
Of cell phone calls and hash tag I-don't-knows.
And you, you're so caught up.
In all the blinking lights and dial tones.

I admit I've been a victim of the worldwide system too.
But I've found my sweet escape when I'm alone with you.
Tune out the static sound of the city that never sleeps.
Here in the moment on the dark side of the screen.

I like the summer rain, I like the sounds you make.
We put the world away, we get so disconnected.
You are my getaway, you are my favourite place.
We put the world away, yeah we're so disconnected.
Oh oh oh oh oh, we're so disconnected.
Oh oh oh oh oh.

Hands around my waist.
You're counting up the hills across the sheets.
And I'm a falling star.
A glimmer lighting up these cotton streets.

I'll admit I've been a fool playing by the rules.
But I've found my sweet escape when I'm alone with you.
Turn down the static sound of the city that never sleeps.
Here in the moment on the dark side of the screen.

Turn off the radio, those late night TV shows.
Hang up the telephone and just be here with me.
Turn off the radio, those late night TV shows.
Hang up the telephone and just be here with me.
