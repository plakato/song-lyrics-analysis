Till the World Ends (Twister Remix) Lyrics
by Twister.


This kitten got your tongue tied in knots I see.
Spit it out cause I'm dying for company.
I notice that you got it.
You notice that I want it.

You know that I can take it.
To the next level, baby.
If you want this good ish.
Sicker than the remix.
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight.

I can't take it  take no more.
Never felt like  this before.
Come on, get me  on the floor.
DJ, what you  waiting for?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Watch me move when I lose, when I lose it hard.
Get you off with the touch, dancing in the dark.
You notice what I'm wearing.
I'm noticing you staring.

You know that I can take it.
To the next level, baby.
Hotter than the A-list.
Next one on my hit list.
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight.

I can't take it  take no more.
Never felt like  this before.
Come on get me  on the floor.
DJ, what you  waiting for?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

See the sunlight.
We ain't stopping.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
If you feel it.
Let it happen.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.

Keep on dancing till the world ends.

Keep on dancing till the world ends.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

See the sunlight.
We ain't stopping.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
If you feel it.
Let it happen.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
