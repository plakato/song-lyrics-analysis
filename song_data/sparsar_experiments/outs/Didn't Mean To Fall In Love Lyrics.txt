Didn't Mean To Fall In Love Lyrics
by Boston.


I didn't mean to fall in love.
I didn't mean to fall in love.

And all I mean to say.
I can't go on the way things are.
How can I lead the way.
It feels so wrong to be so far away.
Ooh, from you tonight.
If I, if I lose you, I can't survive.

Didn't know you would've come tonight.
Didn't hang on long enough.
Didn't want to go and start a fight.
Didn't mean to go, go and fall in love.

It's like an avalanche.
Once you fall you're swept away.
I didn't stand a chance.
Hanging on every word you say.
Hey, we can find a place for love.
Ooh, do you want it bad enough.

So could you catch a plane.
Come back home for one more try.
I'll never be the same.
I fell so hard out of the sky today.
For you, you see.
And you would never believe what you do for me.
Can't you see you're all I need?
