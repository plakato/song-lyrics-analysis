Vibeout Lyrics
by Twitchy.


A little rapper of the century.
I picked up the pen just right after elementary.
Speaking nonsence, until the whorld remembers me.
Tell me that im vibin out, say a complementary.
Feel it in my heart and threw my spinal.
That i have to be heard on a cd or a vinyl.
Don't give a fuck if you hate it be my rival.
I bring them shots like a soldier with his rifle.
A denton texas resident.
Raised on doom, eminem, rap president.
Full of confidence never hesitant.
In the damn game, till im more than just relevant.
Brains still thinking.
And my mouths never drinking.
But i feel like my whole damn worlds just sinking.
Cause ive seen too much with these eyes never blinking.
So i stay blind.
Never behind.
Always on my grind.
Till perfection what i find.
Having you is what i remince.
Twitchy on the premises.
Spittin what seem to be some venomous.
Play the game genesis.
Lyrics straight sickening.
Quit the fucking bickering.
Until you see me on the telly, channel flickering.
You're immature little dickering.
Check your occupation.
No you dont do shows, for the population.
Instead stay home alone, bustin masturbation.
Thinking that you killed the game, annihilation.
Writing in this notepad.
Mellowhigh not really sad.
Saying shit thats really rad.
Raised upon my very dad.
Turned into a maniac.
You can see the sin in that.
Bitch take these feelings back.
Nickanme insaneiac.
Got that fucking wacky flow.
Make it fast or very slow.
Beeend down and touch ye toe.
While im rappin very pro.
Twitchy very lyrical.
Based god blessed its a miracle.
Came out on a blog, then i started giving digital.
People TAKE ME for granted or its literal.
Haha.
