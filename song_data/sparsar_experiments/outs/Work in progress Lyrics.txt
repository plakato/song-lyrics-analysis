Work in progress Lyrics
by Yung 69 & 0ld 420.


We, keep it real like an electric eel 
Shoutout to Bradley Beal 
Right. Now my favorite meal is veal. 
Shit. That gives me all this zeal. 
My old bitch dating a fuckboi like Seal 
But in about three years, I'mma be signed to Mass Appeal 
Come after me, and slip over a banana peel. 
I float over beats like a fucking keel, 
Prefer, my bitch short, so she don't have to kneel 
Pussy and beats the only thing I ever kill. 
 
All my undershirts Polo 
Got, my top button buttoned like a cholo 
Hear me screamin, YOLO 
Take, your bae out to get some froyo 
You, don't even know yo 
SHEESH
