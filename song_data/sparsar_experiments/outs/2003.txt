Can YOU TELL ME WHAT MATTERS AND ACCORDING TO WHO 
I GOT TA SHORT LIFE TO LIVE IM, NOT REPORTING TO YOU 

PLUS? We ALL SMALL STANDING NEXT TO EARTH 
AND! Our SUN IS 93 MILLION TIMES THE SIZE OF OUR EARTH. 
 
SO ITS HARD FOR ME TO FIND WORTH 
AND THAT SUN IS JUS A STAR SON, ONE OF BILL-I-ONS 
MARRIED TO MY DREAMS. Like MY CHRISTINA MILLIAN 
AS, I LOOK UP IN THE STARS IN THE DIRECTION OF MARS, 
YALL JUS WASTIN TIME WITH THOSE CONVENTIONAL BARS 
WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE NIGGA. It COULD PICK YOU APART, 
YOU RAPPIN AND A BLOG GOT YOU THINKIN ITS ART. 
Would YOU MIND TELLIN ME: WHAT DID YOU THINK FROM THE START? 
Im SHININ GOT YOU BLINKIN. You CAN SQUINT FROM AFAR 
WHEN. You SEE ME. I SEEN YA WHOLEJEALOUSY WHEN YOU SEEN ME 
I SEEN YOU ACTIN, LIKE YOU DIDNT, EVEN SEE ME 
HATIN ASS NIGGAS. They ALL WAN NA, BE ME 
FUCK. It IM HEADED TO THE CAR, TO GET WEEDED. 
I JUS NEED THE GREEN OVERALL LIKE LUIGI
