Tom Hardy Lyrics
by QJoshB.

Like Tom Hardy
I die with my gold Towners, just vibe by the stove
And, we eat good, I suppose, and it get better. I know I know
Baby hit me now she on it
Then, we hit South Africa and I'm crushin
And. I ring Blondie from the palm trees
But. I just slide any day now we buzzin
We the army Flex on that chick. Like I'm Arnie
Straight from the East, like I'm Studebaker
Then, I Ball out, like Tom Hardy
Then, I kill flicks like Tom Hardy
We in the heat like Safari's
And, throw parties yea

In the distance sittin on thrones thats. All we know x2
Where, do we go my bae x2
Where do we

I live. I die. I live again, The New Outta Towners
How. Could you clown us
When? We don't hear nothin. We count up count. Up
X2

I'M Ballin out, like Tom Hardy
With, the audio
Baby. She know she, my cardio
QJosh, all the flows scorpios
'member, I flood them. All
Nobody got ta, know Nobody
I stretch her pilates
Fuck with art like Blobbies BruLee
To, the movies off we go. Prolly won't watch it
She on my Denny D Rodman
Knock, the shit out Bernie Hopkins
We on the island, stylin wildin ship, like I'm Popovich
Bumpin that Barter 6 and we make all the hits The Vaders

I die with my gold Towners just vibe by the stove
And we eat good. I suppose, and it get better I know I know
