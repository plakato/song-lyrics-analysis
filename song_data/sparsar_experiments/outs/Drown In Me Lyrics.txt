Drown In Me Lyrics
by Xandria.

Trust in me.
I'll make you see everything inside the fire.
Let us share all our secrets.
I can take away the dire.
I will make you drown.
I will let you fall so deep.
I will see you frown.
I will let you fall so deep into me.
Fight me - as now it's over.
Hate me - so I can forgive myself.
Now I am crying.
Will it be your fate to love and die?
I will make you drown.
I will let you fall so deep.
I will see you frown.
I will let you fall so deep into me.
Forgive me - and die.
