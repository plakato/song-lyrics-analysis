Beautiful Mind Lyrics
by 3 Melancholy Gypsies.

Artist 3 Melancholy Gypsies, 
Album Grand Caravan to the Rim of the World, 
Song Beautiful Mind 
Typed by Johnny Warbux, 
, 
Single male seeking female with a beautiful mind, 
And a physic to keep me peeping like Damn she's fine. 
Let's, take a date with destiny 
Shoot across the Galaxy 
Just me and she 
She, and I acting out fantasies 
Hobbies me 
Swimming in the Milky Way, 
Playing marbles with the stars. 
My noggins spaced out like that 
No sense, 
Why even charge me of malarkey 
Grounded, my heart beat 
But my mind: sky larks, 
See 
Hold. The phrase What if, like a car key 
Roll with me, 
The brain race like road rage 
Strap in before you start me up 
Where the side walk ends is where I dare to jump 
Parachute, while shooting out paragraphs 
Let's, rap, 
Love conversations that tickle your funny bone Make you laugh 
Yeah, I'm comedy 
But, not funny, like ha ha 
The type of funny that you chuckle at when out of ya, mind 
Birth, sign, Aquarius 
People, think they see me like Where he go There. He is. 
Thoughts, don't drift in one line: 
Movements various 
I'm, a daydream, catcher 
For, your love and laughter. I fish 
Sailing on the winds blown after making a wish. 
You'Re number one on my to do list 
 
Scarub. If so beautiful your mind is 
Scarub.
