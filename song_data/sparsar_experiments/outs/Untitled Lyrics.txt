Untitled Lyrics
by XCEP.


This beat got the classic outta me, you're about to witness grace.
I'm about to flow it like it's 1990 on the date.
That ape shit, Darwin, back to our basis.
Ancient, put the rhythm vintage on these phrases.
I'm racist to mothafuckas who can't rhyme.
They be slaves to my rhyme book, I'm talking chains and braces.
This game, I embrace it, I play no more.
You know that you're weak, now face it don't play no more.
I'm the one who made some mothafuckas say no more.

Suckas won't ever forget now they got the photo.
I got 'em surrounded they be calling five o.
I got 'em amazed they all be like bravo.
But they be talking behind my back, alright, I know.
And I don't give a shit cause I don't need 'em they know.
That I'm a self-made nigga all I need is foes, ya bitch.

And it never goes down, who can do it better in town?
Ima watch y'all bitches frown while y'all tryna snatch the crown.
It's far from your reach, who you tryna fool with your speeches.
It's XCEP the bad mothafucka with a the features.
Preach! The beats put your pain at ease.
Don't get butt-hurt I got the melodies for your disease.
It's the XTCs don't ya mothafuck with the bees.
Whenever shit gets real you know we're ready to squeeze.
Bitch please, switch the Ds.
Come over here, fuck with a real nigga who could really please ya.
Tease ya, give you all the real shit that frees ya.
My shit give all these other mothafuckas amnesia.
You heard? now spread the word.
These dumb mothafuckas absurd tryna fuck with a nerd.
These other bitches so stupid tryna cuff a bird.
All's I'm saying it's XCEP fuck what you infer.
Now break it down.
