Drive Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


I remember the way you slept, when we were on our way back home.
It was forty-seven miles I kept inside my heart and soul.

And you should, you know that i will never let you go.
I will never fail, I will never let you go.

I counted mile, I never wanted it to end.
You made it worth my while, I felt like I was whole again.
