Green Lyrics
by X.E.X.

Lets get Sexual.

Lets turn the lights off.
Cuz tonight its gon be rough.
Are you tough ?
Baby girl are you tough?
Cuz I've got dem Handcuffs.

Hop on my menu.
I need to eat you.
Hop on my menu.
I need to feed you.
And it ain't a question baby no no.
Its a command so baby move.

Lets get Sexual.

Are you green in this game?
Or are you grey in this game?
Cuz i could make you a pro today.
If you're down to play, my way.

And by the end of the night baby.
You'll wanna stay.
And by the end of the night baby.
I'll be your prey.
And by the end of the night baby.
We'll make you rain.

And I'll be drowning in your ocean.
And you'll be drowning in obsession.
And you'll get lost in my fuckn world.
Buts that's ok baby , I'll entertain.

We will eat.
We'll have a feast.
We'll have a party baby.
Just you and me.
And I will sip you like wine.
And lets take our time.
