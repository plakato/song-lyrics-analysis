The Place Lyrics
by Xilent.


Now we have seen the light.
Seen the darkest nights.
Learned there's a risk to take.
Full of pleasure and pain.
Never lose sight of what my soul requires.
Even if the way seems much too long.
I patiently move on, trying to stay on target.
Till I reach the place where I belong.

On and on's the way to go.
Ain't no bashing storm to bring us low.
On and on's the way to go.
Ain't no bashing storm to bring us low.

So I love and I breath.
And I'm bravely moving on.
Till I reach the place where I belong.
