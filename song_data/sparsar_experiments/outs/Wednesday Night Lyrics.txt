Wednesday Night Lyrics
by 420Chainz.


What's up? This 420 Chainz.
A.K.A. Nick Bean's worst nightmare.

Oligarchy's back and we here to shine.
We be fresh as fuck nigga, dress to the nines..
Write every day, call me Thomas Hardy.
Spit mad game, but ain't got a Lombardi.

Listened to your old shit, that sucked.
Had your girl come over to get my dick sucked.
You don't want me, nigga get fucked.

I get head, call that brains.
See my stacks you go insane.
Go to the club, and make it rain.

Beautiful women.
I'm Frank White, she lil kimmin'.
Lie for me, now can't you see.
I'm the one you niggas wanna be.
Let's make it john lennon.
And let it be.
