Airplanes (feat. Eppic) Lyrics
by Tyler Ward.


Can we pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky 
Are like shooting stars 
I, could really use a wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
Can. We pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky 
Are like shooting stars 
I, could really use a wish right now. 
Wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
 
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish. 
To go back to a place, much simpler than this 
Cause. After all, the partyin' and smashin' and crashin' 
And, all the glitz and the glam and the fashion 
And. All the pandemonium and all the madness 
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness 
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap, 
And you hopin', but them people never call you back 
But, that's just how the story unfolds. 
You get another hand soon. After you fold 
And, when your plans unravel in the sand 
What, would you wish for if you had one chance, 
So airplane airplane? Sorry, I'm late 
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate 
If! I don't make that then I'll switch. My flight 
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night, 
 
Can. We pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky 
Are like shooting stars 
I, could really use a wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
Can. We pretend that airplanes 
In. The night sky 
Are like shooting stars 
I, could really use a wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
 
Ya ya. Somebody take me back to the days 
Befo'. This was a job befo'. I got paid 
Befo' it ever mattered. What I had in my bank, 
Ya back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway 
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it 
But. Nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant 
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes, outta' airplanes 
Then. Maybe, oh maybe I'll go back to the days 
Befo', the politics that we call the rap game 
And back when ain't, nobody, listen to my mixtape 
And back befo'. I tried to cover up my slang 
But. This is fo' Decatur. What'S up Bobby Ray 
So? Can I get a wish 
To end the politics 
And get back to the music 
That started this shit 
So. Here I stand and then again I say: 
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes: outta' airplanes, 
 
Can. We pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky 
Are like shooting stars 
I, could really use a wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
Wish right now, 
Can. We pretend that airplanes 
In the night sky 
Are like shooting stars 
I, could really use a wish right now. 
Wish right now, 
Wish right now, 

I could really use a wish right now. {, oh oh-oh, } 
 
I-I-I could really use a wish right now. 
 
Like like like shootin' stars, {, oh oh ..., oh }, 
 
I-I-I-I, could really use a wish right now. 
 
A wish a wish right now:
