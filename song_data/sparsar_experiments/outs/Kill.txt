Kill
by Blood Duster.

An all-American boy.
Voted likely to succeed.
Started hearing voices.
So he made people bleed.

He had to kill 13.
Stopping earthquakes.
Was his dream by 1972.
Herb became a normal dude.
But he kept hearing voices.
He was in a violent mood.
He had to kill 13.
Stopping earthquakes was his dream.

Voices told Herb.
13 must be killed.
He did his best.
That the orders were fulfilled.
Splattered with their blood.
More fun in Santa Cruz.
