Anyway Lyrics
by Vixen.

Why can't we just skip to the good part.
Why do we play these silly games.
To get to the heart of the matter that's in our hearts.
We go round and round again and again.

By the time you come around.
I'll be tired of being kept down.

I don't trust you but I love you.
I don't trust you but I love you.
And I'm in the game … anyway.

When will you see how right we are.
Where will I be when that light shines.
And gives you sight of what you were too blind to see.
The soul you could have saved was mine.

By the time you notice me.
I'll be too far off to see.
I'm the one that you'll think of.
When you want to know true love.

It all stays the same … anyway.

I wanted to believe you.

I'm the one that you'll think of.
When you want to know true love.

I'll never stay … anyway.

Never gonna trust you but I'll always love you, always love you.
