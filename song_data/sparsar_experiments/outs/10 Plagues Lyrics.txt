10 Plagues Lyrics
by Ty Barz.


Barz.
Step out the tomb looking Egyptian nigga.
Looking all mummified &amp; shit.
When I die bury me with my riches, my bitches &amp; everything else.
All Gold Everything like a Pharaoh nigga.
Yurp. Dats Cool Dats Cool.

Welcome to dear Egypt, feel the fire of Phoenix.
I'mma body this shit, it don't need a remix.
Yall having niggas equipped with the E Clips caused a eclipse.
Looking at these shells &amp; holy water left me seasick.
Lose ya focus to the bogus, watch dat lotus turn to locust.
It's ferocious when ya oldest disappear without a notice.
Pray to Moses when you hopeless, Joseph as a bonusss.
This ain't Hip-Hopppppp...Motherfucker this hypnosis.

10 plagues 10 plagues...Yall motherfuckers got trends paid.
Yall motherfuckers made wins fade...Yall motherfuckers should of been prayed.
10 plagues,10 plagues...Yall motherfuckers got sins made.
Yall motherfuckers got friends sprayed...Yall motherfuckers should of been.
prayed.

Shit gets odd when the gods get even.
Feel Ra breathing so I can believe in.
Demons screaming looking for a reason.
Wake a nigga up cuz I must be dreaming.
Dreams in the Nile they so in denial.

Catch me &amp; Ro in the city Cairo.
Dont care tho...Get a nigga get Jacked likee Sparrow.
That's what a nigga get when he in my shadow.
Make him worship gods in the parameds  like pharoahs.
I'm just a boy with intentions of tension.
So I live life in a different dimension.
I mention dat all men decided to sin since.
Vengeance the thing dat got him a sentence.

Motherfuckin Ty Barz!
Let them know the UFO or the slaves didn't build the pyramids, you did.
This ya shit, you own this.
DeGENErates.
Get back to the game though.
Fuck these Conspiracy Theories.
