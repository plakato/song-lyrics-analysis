Life is Serious Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


Life is serious out here on these streets.
Got us curious but were just trying to eat.

Why cry now inhale the pain is gone.
Get your life back together it's time to move.
I know it was your baby daddy I saw you kiss him.
Hold up little boy screaming Jesus I miss him.
Ain't nobody gonna treat you they way he did.
He left you with biggest gift he made a kid.
Now you grab him and smile remember your man.
Even though the life you want it didn't go as plan.
With no money for the baby never held a job.
When the rent was due he always grab the chopper and ride.
What you blushing I know you love my nigga.
In the casket at 22 he didn't figure.
You was mad at the funeral seeing his hoes.
But he kept it real with you like an thug suppose.
You chose to love my nigga that you met in the Ville.
You gonna always love my dog even though he got killed.

Smile know Kendall I know you miss my nigga.
Two kids to raise without an father figure.
And your youngest son screaming my daddy going to heaven.
You and Bobby Phills always suppose to be together.
And everytime you see ball make you wanna cry.
Cause my nigga had G and you know he could rise.
From the streets to the big league.
From the ghetto to the palm trees.
We pour liquor caused he moved on.
You shed tears but you stayed strong.
And at the funeral made jokes about his birthday.
His last words was same time but a different place.

And a time I burn a cross.
For the nigga I lost.
One slug took the life of my young thug in cold blood.
R.I.P. to every daddy on Ken D.
I'm missing ya'll till this cold earth send me.
Sippin a sprite.
Breakin my life.
When the day turn night and just write.
Till I bed wrinkle.
Dippin these hoes till I plant sequel.
Running around with that desert eagle.
Like it was a bit legal.
I got a call from my uncle state.
Said it will be a while for they let him out them gates.
Drop the phone as the tears hit the tip of my ears.
I'm gonna disappear if he gotta serve more years.
