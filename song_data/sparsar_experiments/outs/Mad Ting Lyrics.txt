Mad Ting Lyrics
by Swindle.


Hello? Blud, does anybody know what's going on?
Hello, excuse me? Excuse me?
Yo, anyone know what's going on? Hello? Oi.
Hello? Oi, what's going on? Can you hear, can you hear me?
I wanna hear it now. What? I wanna hear it now. What?
Right now. What? Yo Swindle.

Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.

Trust, when the beat kicks in, it's sick.
Pure-pure darkness, but man ain't gonna stop till the ravers quit.
Man ain't gonna stop till the DJ faints, pure darkness.
Everybody knows my name, if not, shame.
Trust, when the bassline drops, it's mad.
Pure-pure darkness, man have been about since record bags.
Man have been about since cutting dubs, pure-pure darkness.
Everybody move with us, if not, dust.

Break 1.
Jamie.
You can definitely hear me, you get me?
Where are we going now? Where we going?
A bit of space.
Give me some room.
Get back, get back.
Get back, listen to me.

Mad ting.
Mad ting.

Trust, when you feel that vibe, it's hype.
Pure-pure darkness, and man ain't gonna stop till they switch on the lights.
Man ain't gonna stop till the feds get here, pure darkness.
Gun fingers up in the air, if not, dead.
Trust, when you drop this tune, it's nuts.
Pure-pure darkness, man ain't gonna stop till the music cuts.
Man ain't gonna stop till they clear out the room, pure-pure darkness.
Bop your head to the tune, if not, move.

Break 2.
Hello?
Blud, does anybody know what's going on?
Hello, excuse me?  Excuse me?
Yo, anyone know what's going on?  Hello? Oi.
Mad ting.

Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.

Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.
Mad ting.
