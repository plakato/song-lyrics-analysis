Ice Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Ice, ice, ice, ice.
Ice, ice know I got that ice bitch.

Find me in the river spittin'.
I got 340 bitches.
I don't want no dirty living.
Clean pussy until I die.

Put that shit up on my life.
Cross that bitch and hope to die.
This cash is crazy but i'm lazy.
So i'm poorly fortified i'm sippin'.

Flip a bitch back on my lap.
Call it back pack.
Leave a hashtag.
Then we back track, fast trap.
Hoping I could rap fast.
Thinking like an ugly bitch but I never had that.

Thinking i'm up on it.
I have talent.
I want money I want balance.
You can't be me i'm not average I got.

Ice, ice, ice, ice.
Ice, ice know I got that ice bitch.
