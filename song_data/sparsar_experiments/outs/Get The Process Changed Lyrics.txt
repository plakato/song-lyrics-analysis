Get The Process Changed Lyrics
by The Swellers.

11:44 a poor man asks you for some change. You say you're out of money and.
then you go on your way. He stops you as you're walking he says that's not.
what I meant, how could you be so ignorant? Sure I could use some money but.
I'm interested in what you could do to make it better in the world that I live.
in. Will you contribute to how our nation falls apart? Will you vote not to.
have a heart? Change. We'll get the process changed. I'd rather change than.
run away. It's kind of obvious why people shy away. But all the hands that.
help I know uplift the hands that pray. It takes a half a cent to feed a.
hungry child in pain. Just let them live another day. Instead of politics we.
should just set it all aside. Uncover awful truths that for so long we tried.
to hide. We need to drop some food instead of dropping atom bombs. We're.
killing children, dads, and moms. Change. We'll get the process changed. I'd.
rather change than run away.
