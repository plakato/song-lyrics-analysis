Crush On You Lyrics
by 3LW.

Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

Boy, I got a crush on you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Naughty things going through my mind.
When I think of you.
Boy I'm diggin' you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Babygirl's been puttin' it down.
When he ain't around.

I bend some of the rules.
When it comes to you.
You make me wanna do.

I call you on the creep.
Late at night when my pop's asleep.
Gotta keep in on the low.
Can't let my daddy know.

Boy, I got a crush on you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Naughty things going through my mind.
When I think of you.
Boy I'm diggin' you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Babygirl's been puttin' it down.
When he ain't around.

Is this some crazy dream?
Can't stop the way I feel.
When I'm alone with you.
The pressure is for real.
I'm feelin' all these ways.
I never felt before.
Come here and close the door.
A kiss is what I been waiting for.

Boy, I got a crush on you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Naughty things going through my mind.
When I think of you.
Boy I'm diggin' you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Babygirl's been puttin' it down.
When he ain't around.

Rap.
Keelay is, the one gettin' the busiest.
Far from the silliest.
Tell me, are you feelin' this?
Not just for little kids.
Little Women be strong enough.
We rock long enough, for real.
But the ones that been waitin' to drop.
They say yo, shorty rock.
She be makin' it hot.
You know, A.G. know.
Toy, she know.
Little Women, 2000.
You know how we go.

I'll take my chances boy.
When it comes to you.
Just name the time and place.
Do what I gotta do.
My heart is sayin' yes.
My mind is sayin' no.
I'll risk it all for you.
Daddy don't have to know.

Boy, I got a crush on you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Naughty things going through my mind.
When I think of you.
Boy I'm diggin' you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Babygirl's been puttin' it down.
When he ain't around.

Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

Boy, I got a crush on you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Naughty things going through my mind.
When I think of you.
Boy I'm diggin' you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Babygirl's been puttin' it down.
When he ain't around.

Boy, I got a crush on you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Naughty things going through my mind.
When I think of you.
Boy I'm diggin' you.
My dad would kill me if he only knew.
Babygirl's been puttin' it down.
When he ain't around.
