Who? 7x.

You see rain eroded zahra jewels embedded in my chest piece.
Armor on me especially you need to bring catastrophe.
All my squad be waiting up for me to come and take the lead.

All my niggas smoking where we are you can't say anything Gundam gas laced inside my blunt.
I'm smoking everything.
Should I pull off with his bitch and let her taste that everything.
I could twist tornado that'd be worse than what the nature bring.

Now they look my way with side eyes cuz they don't fuck with me.
I don't subtweet I hit the @, what's his link my G.

All my Niggas living in a swarm of insanity.
You know I don't use the guns but some of my niggas ain't the same as me.
Bitch.
