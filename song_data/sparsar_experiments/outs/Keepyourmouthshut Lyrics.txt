Keepyourmouthshut Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


Blood trickles down, blood trickles down.
Start to feel good and I can't go on again, go on again.
Tied to the past, tied to the past.
Try to move on and I start to count to ten, count to ten.

So, fuck what you heard about me.
You don't really know me anyways.
When you talk a lot but you can't see.
Focusing on old shit everyday.

Feel it again, feel it again.
All of the screaming and I fall down again, fall down again.
Try to conceive, try to conceive.
What I can see in myself all again, all again.

So, fuck what you heard about me.
You don't really know me anyways.
