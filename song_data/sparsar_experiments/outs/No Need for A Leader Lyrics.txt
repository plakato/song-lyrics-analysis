No Need for A Leader Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

Something wicked this way comes.
We don't like to fall.
But when we come down we lose it all.
Then we open someone new.
We eat their bones and wonder why they have no bones left.

Maybe one day we'll find we have.
No need for a leader.

I watch the faces on a screen.
No question what I'll have to pay for my apathy.
Can you feel it on your face.
The winds of change are a lot unfriendlier these days.

Maybe one day we'll find we have.
No need for a leader.

Something wicked this way comes.
We don't like to fall.
But when we come down we lose it all.
Then we open someone new.
We eat their bones and wonder why they have no bones left.

Maybe one day we'll find we have.
No need for a leader.
