Baskon Lyrics
by Arash.

Arash, Timbuktu.
Oy oy oy oy u.
Una na na na na na.
Unana unana.
Hey hey hey hey come on!
unana!
Out of five ways to do it when.
Four be the simpelest.
I'm a ride the hard roll.
When it's more then the instruments.
More chat then your messages.
Bored on the internet.
More rap then anything you can store on your intellect.
I'm saying it, thinking it.
I'm tired of you bickering.
I'm tired, I'm not listening it.
Why you keep on whispering.
You're blabering is leading.
Up on nothing, won't you nothing.
While I'm sitting there and whishing that you would shut up or something.
Won't you please.
Give that mouth of yours a rest.
I need some peace, so you can see the door instead.
It's been a couple of hours now give me a break, cause I've got no interest in.
anything that you say!
Na na na na na.
Bas kon harf nazan,.
Khastam ghor nazan..

Na na na na na.
Bas kon harf nazan.
Khastam ghor nazan.
Now every time I see you.
Even call me on the telephone.
And I can take it easy.
If you're leaving me the hell alone.
Why you won't cease and assist.
With the speach from your lips.
Cause I just see no reason for this.
My head has spining.
All I want to do is relax.
Why won't you take the man.
And find somebody new to attack?
Now get up of my ear.
And get up and get going.
So I can kick my feet up and.
Enjoy this next moment.
Na na na na na.
Bas kon harf nazan.
Khastam ghor nazan.

Na na na na na.
Bas kon harf nazan.
Khastam ghor nazan.
Kheili tuye kafam man.
kheili tuye kafam man.
Karit nadaram, azat bizaram.
Velam kon!
kheili tuye kafam man.
kheili tuye kafam man.
Karit nadaram, azat bizaram.
Velam kon!
Na na na na na.
Bas kon harf nazan.
Khastam ghor nazan.

Na na na na na.
Bas kon harf nazan.
Khastam ghor nazan.
