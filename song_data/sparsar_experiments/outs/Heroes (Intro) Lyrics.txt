Heroes (Intro) Lyrics
by Ruthless Ambition.

Lets begin now.

Young D &amp; DreadHead SchoolBoy.

Flying real high and we saving lives.
Crew neck sweater no cape and tights.
Making business moves no suit and tie.
Tho I.
Have a Polo sweater as a disguise.
All the eyes see surprise when the villain demise.
And our time relies On The R.A. Sign.
In the sky that means it's go time.
Go time so I set my eyes on the prize.
Ruthless Ambition.
Do not look for me because I am Missing.
Preaching to all and I Hope that you listen.
Praying we make it man stop all that wishing.
Praying we die man stop all that dissing.
Dismissing and killing the mission.
We Getting and pulling it through.
Feeling the ceiling.
I'm Flouting and healing.
The people in trouble what else would I do.
Not help All of you.
Man that isn't cool.
What i Need to do.
Is stop all this flu.
That be Sickening you.
We Kicking The juice.
Then Letting you loose.
We Put us to use.
So Unpredictable.
Get it in Your visual.

Just get ready here we go.
Rapping like a miracle.
Oh man where'd Amir just go.
Went to up his lyrics tho.
So Ruthless on your stereo.

You won't expect some heroes tho.
Right on top some pharaohs tho.

Press The button let it free.
All these rappers dreading me.
Like a Haitian you better be.
Listen to this while shaking.
Breaking records.
King me checkers.
You give lesser.
We Bring Pressure.
Give a lecture.
You say yes sir.
And we make sure that we better.
Put the time to get the treasure.
Not just settle for the pleasure.
Because by time is greatness measured.
So lets make the greatest records.
Give them time to recollect it.
But make it when they least expect it.
When we spit you must respect it.
Ruthless AM we got next and.

Oh My Gosh....
Whoa hey you're ahead of yourself.
I don't even know what its all about yet.
