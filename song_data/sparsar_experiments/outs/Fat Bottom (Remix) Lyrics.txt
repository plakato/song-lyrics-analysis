Fat Bottom (Remix) Lyrics
by Z-Trip.


Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Ah, down beside that red firelight.
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go round.
Fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go round.

Hey I was just a skinny lad.
Never knew no good from bad.
But I knew life before I left my nursery - huh.
Left alone with big fat Fanny.
She was such a naughty nanny.
Woman you made a bad boy out of me.
Hey hey!
I've been singing with my band.
Across the water across the land.
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way, uh.
But their beauty and their style.
Went kind of smooth after a while.
Take me to them dirty ladies every time.

Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Ah, down beside that red firelight.
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go round.
Fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go round.

Now I'm missin' collared greens, fat bottoms in their jeans.
From early in their thirties until their late teens.
Makin' dreams come true.
Run 'em all throughout the crew.
Late night on a tour bus, you know how we do.
We only take the thick ones, no anorexic sick ones.
MURS under pressure.
Tryin' to bust a quick one.
Might forget her name when I'm caught up in a rush.
Next town, new girl +Another One Bites The Dust+.

Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Ah, down beside that red firelight.
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go round.
Fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go round.

Scratched.
Get on your bikes and ride.
Fat bottomed girls.
Rockin'.
I want to ride.
On the wheels of steel.

Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Ah, down beside that red firelight.
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go round.
Fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go round.
