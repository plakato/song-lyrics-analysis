Dumb Shit Lyrics
by Zip K..


Lately I been screamin fuck the world without a rubber.
Niggas tell me pappy you's a crazy muthafucka.
Cause I be going through it with my bitch.
Through it with my bitch aye.
Dealin with her shit cause I love her.
Dumb shit.
Dumb shit.
Don't it make you do dumb shit, dumb shit.
Don't it make you do.
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb, shit.

Damn the times have changed.
We don't rap about love no more.
We just talk about fuck that bitch.
We just talk bout forgot that ho.
We just talk about whip that wrist.
We just talk about ship that blow.
I don't say much on none of that shit.
I just talk bout the shit I know.
And I know she bad know she good.
Know she known in every hood.
Know she know too many folks I know that's why we get into it.
Late nights turn to what the hell you doins.
All your girlfriends got you so influenced.
You don't love these niggas you just love attention.
I don't see the damn difference.

Dammit times have changed.
Damn you love the lights.
Damn you like to fuss damn we love to fight.
Shit, how'd we get it wrong?
I guess moms and pops was right.
Guess that tinted chevy in your neighborhood.
Ain't my niggas every night.
Checking on you right?
Overstep my role I do.
Look how hard I go for you.
Jealousy is no excuse.
But fuck that I don't trust that shit.
And you love that shit, sounds dumb as shit I know.
And the world keeps turning slow but.
