Checked Lyrics

Yea they gotta be checked.
People always hittin up my phone talkin crazy.

Yea they gotta be checked.
It always starts out fine.
But then they cross the line.
And I'm like.
Yea they gotta be.
Checked checked checked checked checked checked checked.
Yea they gotta be.
Checked checked checked checked checked checked checked.
Yea they gotta be.

I think you do too much talkin.
All of your girlfriends text us.
Like they live in Austin.
Often.
We just.
Let these hoes slide thru.
I don't mean to ruffle and feathers when I fly thru.
But you should just take into account that.
You might try and check me.
But your check is gonna bounce.
That's a sticky situation.
I would hate to be you.
I know that you love me.
All that hatin is just see thru.

I suggest you come correct.
Male or female.
You close minded.
I'm just gettin rich off retail.
Funny cuz these hoes poppin back up.
Shootin at my dreams.
I ain't even call for back up.
Bout to be pushin somethin crazy.
Money comin down the pipeline.
Standing on your rooftops.
Fuckin up your skyline.
While you gettin checked.
I'm just checkin out my flight time.
Bout to make yo salary 5 times.

Yea they gotta be checked.
People always hittin up my phone talkin crazy.

Yea they gotta be checked.
It always starts out fine.
But then they cross the line.
And I'm like.
Yea they gotta be.
Checked checked checked checked checked checked checked.
Yea they gotta be.
Checked checked checked checked checked checked checked.
Yea they gotta be.

I think you do too much talkin.
All of your girlfriends text us.
Like they live in Austin.
Often.
We just.
Let these hoes slide thru.
I don't mean to ruffle and feathers when I fly thru.
But you should just take into account that.
You might try and check me.
But your check is gonna bounce.
That's a sticky situation.
I would hate to be you.
I know that you love me.
All that hatin is just see thru.

Different girl every day.
Swear I'm livin like a rockstar.
Train movin fast.
I forgot where my stops are.
I could see myself stayin on.
Lotta girls in Saudi.
I'm the one that they waitin on.
I've been on a hot streak.
Everything premeditated.
Bigger than my body.
Yea my soul just levitated.
I call it out when I see it.
I don't mind the confrontation.
But before we even start the conversation.

Yea they gotta be checked.
People always hittin up my phone talkin crazy.

Yea they gotta be checked.
It always starts out fine.
But then they cross the line.
And I'm like.
Yea they gotta be.
Checked checked checked checked checked checked checked.
Yea they gotta be.
Checked checked checked checked checked checked checked.
Yea they gotta be.
