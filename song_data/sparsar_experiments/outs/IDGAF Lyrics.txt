IDGAF Lyrics
by Swelo.


Don't you get tired.
Of looking everyday.
In the mirror at your body with uncertainty?
I see you glancing across the room.
You're unsure if you want.
Someone to notice you.
And.
I feel them judging me judging you.
All the things that we want to do.
Never seems good enough for them.

So I put my hands up ‘cuz I don't really care.
I'll do what I want.
I'll do it anywhere.
So I put my hands up ‘cuz I don't really care.
I'll do what I want.
I'll do it anywhere.
Because.

I don't give a fuck.
I – I don't – don't give a fuck.
Oooh.
Ooooooooh.

I don't give a fuck what you think about me.
And I don't really care for your company.
I don't really want to know what you do.
And I really don't want to know who you knew.
‘Cuz I'm out here just doing me.
You can keep your two cents.
‘Cuz I'm feeling free.
And I'm feeling wild, and I'm feeling young.
And when you criticize me you sound kind of dumb.
Listen: I don't give a single fuck.
So if you feeling like me, then put your hands up.

Sorry for the interruption.

I just have to ask this question – statement, really.
If you don't give a fuck then put your fucking hands up.
If you don't give a fuck then put your fucking hands up.
If you don't give a fuck then put your fucking hands up.
If you don't give a fuck then put your fucking hands up.
