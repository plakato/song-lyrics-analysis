I'm A Senior Citizen Lyrics
by Yung God.

Yung - God, Yung God, Yung God, Yung God, 
I ain't even got ta use no ad libs on this one nigga we'bout to go in man, 
Yuh yuh, yuh, yuh, 
 
I was born 19-2-5 and im still alive 
No. I can't drive 
Bitch. I won't retire 
It's about 5 in the morning bitch I'm up 
Coffee. In my cup Viagra on deck in case a bitch wan na fuck 
Fuck, your grill, my new dentures, all white 
7 P.M. goodnight go to sleep early 
Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo 6. In a row 
Broke my hip, when I fell on the flo' 
401k doe 
Go to church in the front row 
Walk with a cane sort of like a pimp 
Soaking in the tub bubble, bath bitch 
Back in my day, back in my day, ... 
Fill up a Tank with 50 cents 
Posted on the porch handicap park, 
Walk in the store grits on sale, 
Pull, your pants up, young man or you're going to go to hell, 
Golden Girls. They could get it 
Tuck. My shirt in my britches 
Yuh yuh yuh yuh whoa senior citizen flow 
, 
Yuh yuh, yuh, yuh 
It's, a party gray, haired, shorty 
Damn, I'm bald, went and bought me a wig 
Stupid ass bitch. I ain't trying to watch your kids, 
Poppin them pills and I don't give a shit 
Swerving in my motorized scooter and I'm high off medication'til I die 
The light was green, that nigga lied, 
I'm 68 and I'm fitting to turn 69 
Oh. My god I said 69. Oh, my god, I just said 69 nigga, 
, 
This ain't, no diss to the old folks 
This, like a freestyle tribute to the old folks, 
I just went in for all the senior citizens, nigga 
Ah Huh
