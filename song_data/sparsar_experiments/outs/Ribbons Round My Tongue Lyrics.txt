Ribbons Round My Tongue Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Oh lady fair, your stranglin' hair.
Ribbons 'round my tongue.
I try to speak, my thoughts grow weak.
From all the yarns you've spun.

I heard them say that evil may.
Walk in beauty's shoes.
But if ever I could love myself.
Then I'll stop loving you.

Were you out the other night.
Flirting with all my friends?
I heard you told a joke or two.
With my name at the end.

Well, come 'round home, i'm all alone.
And tell me that just ain't true.
But if ever I could love myself.
Then I'll stop loving you.

When you're gone, I'll carry on.
It's never meant to last.
I'd much prefer to sit alone.
And drink about the past.

So I say some how, some way.
Till I believe it's true.
But if ever I could love myself.
Then I'll stop loving you.
