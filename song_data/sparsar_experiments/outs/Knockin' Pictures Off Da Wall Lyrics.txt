Knockin' Pictures Off Da Wall.

Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis.
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces.
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall.
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall.
As i come around your block turnin heads and ridin slow.
With a pocket full of money but i gots to get mo.
Staying grain about a thang as i swoop from lane to lane.
So we can say when i can bang with like a piece without a chain.
Got me, knock me, but that kind of stuff don't stop me.
Since i wanna be a balla got the world wanna watch me.
Don't hate just wait for me to skate down ya street.
Ball out smoke a sweet with benjamin franklins on my feet.
Bald fade hit em with shade never afros and braids.
We stackin can of raid cause all roaches getting sprayed.
Not cappin just a reala still making playa choices.
So the next choice is from the heart hear my name in different voices.
Juiced up and toed down on my flip makin my rounds.
Smellin like a pound drippin finna paint your town.
Makin way how I play leanin' hard unless you doze.
Hopped up with ?? and vogues.
With matching floors and starch ya clothes.
Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis.
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces.
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall.
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall.
Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis.
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces.
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall.
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall.
Now we mobbin for real flippin' lexus to deal.
Mashin 90 on the field with a dark senorita.
And some long haired Italians, piece and chain medalions.
My currency increasin, I'm droppin 50 on ya gallon.
I gots the car rollin, looks like y'all say I'm cold.
Still ? watch my currency unfold.
I think you ridin long seven dayz at the creek.
Bling tatted on my arm how we flip it ? we greet.
Never brag never boast, fly'n coast to coastsmokin dank sippin drank.
Eat'n scrambled eggs and toast.
Chingale my padre,bought a Lexus for my madre.
Red bubble lense smoking swishas on the highway.
Parking on the sand, jumping up outta the van.
Byzantine around my neck diamonds glistenin on my hand.
Watch i spin heads with my cranberry red.
Remote controlled vcr stretch burban with beddouble stretch limosuine.
Twenty inch byzantine.
I live my life a ballin' hustla could it all be a dream.
Exotic beaches and peaches, white tigers on leashes.
We gonna shine on our way to the lane the speed on our Lexus increases.
In this game on a mission light it up expedition.
You ain't gotta be all up in my face.
I blind you hoes from a distance.
Chandeliers in my den, blowin' smoke in the wind.
You can catch me in my 600 or the big body benz.
Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis.
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces.
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall.
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall.
Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis.
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces.
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall.
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall.
