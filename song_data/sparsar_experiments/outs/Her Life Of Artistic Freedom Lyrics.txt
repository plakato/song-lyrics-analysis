Her Life Of Artistic Freedom Lyrics
by Swirlies.

What if i had it wrong.

And she knew that but she felt that i could.

And she said that i had it wrong.

What if she don't come back.

And goes away to a place.

And finds it's better/badder.

I might just crawl away.

Never go home again.

Home again.
