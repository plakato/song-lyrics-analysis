All Eyes On Me Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

YOU'VE COME TO SEE HOW A HERO LIVES?*.
YOU'LL ONLY FIND A VICTIM.
This is not what you did expect to see.
Now feast your eyes on my misery.
THESE THOUGHTS ARE OVERWHELMING.
I CAN'T RESIST THE ASSIMILATION.
THE DARK SIDE GROWS WITHIN.
All of my agonies turned to hate.
I feast my eyes on the enemy.
Hear me.
This is the time when you seek me.
Learning the truth you will leave me.
To follow your heart again.
No need to tell me what's wrong or right.
Already made up my mind to fight.
I DON'T FEAR BUT HATE YOU.
WITH RAGE AND PAIN I RISE.
Hear me.
This is the time when you seek me.
Learning the truth you will leave me.
To follow your heart again.
LEAVE ME, FLEE ME TO MY HORROR.
