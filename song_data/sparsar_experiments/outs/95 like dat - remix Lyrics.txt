95 like dat - remix Lyrics
by Tyga.

95, like dat 
95, like dat 
95, like dat, 
95, 
95 stylin straight shots, gold, medallion 
Put. Your number on this paper promise I'mma dial it 
Cute college. Chick daddy was a doctor 
Word to the great Vonn she datin a rapper 
Entertainer athlete she never after 
So. I entertain her late night well after 
High 10 after midnight, his bedtime 
You could say I stole a heart. I just call it face time. 
No rush, just relax your mind. 
You are now listening to sounds of a better rap 
Bands in drop. There'S mosh pit in the lobby, 
Girl so horny, that's my type of party 
No ties, mob shits suits and ties 
Crap table Vegas, vampire nights. 
I marry you tonight just to say we did it right. 
Waking up with regrets. Roll over 
She be like Why you never called me back 
Sometimes. You just be like that. 
Can'T promise the world, but I could promise you half of that 
Sometimes. You just be like that 
All, the rumors, you heard. I ain't got no time for that 
Shit. I ain't got no time for that. 
And. You ain't got ta cry dry, your eyes. We gon get through that 
Trust we gon get through that 
95. Like dat, 
Reservations call serve a table: 
Alligator snake skin purple label, 
Polyester black berretta, who do it better 
For. My niggas caged up writing them letters. 
Lower level reporting live channel 11 
No emergency, but I'm in the 9/11 
Far settle girl, scream a red fellow 
Pull up on the scene bumping on the instrumental 
And. You know it know it. 
Time flies when you're flying first class. All the time 
And, you know it know it 
No time for the games dollar signs on my mind, 
And. You know it know it 
Eye for an eye young killa, just wan na stay alive 
And. You know it know it. 
 Got ta, learn to live with. Regrets I regret the times 
You like Why you never called me back 
Sometimes. You just be like that. 
Can'T promise the world, but I could promise you half of that 
Sometimes. You just be like that 
All, the rumors you heard. I ain't got no time for that. 
Shit, I ain't got no time for that. 
And. You ain't got ta cry dry, your eyes. We gon get through that 
Trust. We gon get through that 
95, like dat 
95, like dat 
95, like dat 
95 like dat, 
Litigations black faces lawyers, briefcases 
Agent, top notch paid investigations, 
Fired off top block shots, Anthony Davis, 
Rod, the greatest acres, no neighbors 
Do that so many times hope you do better. Next time, 
Think about a dog next time you drop a dime 
Better ride, so she rather fly 
Always aksing me the same thing all the time 
Why you never called me back. 
Sometimes. You just be like that. 
Can'T promise the world, but I could promise you half of that 
Sometimes. You just be like that 
All, the rumors, you heard. I ain't got no time for that 
Shit. I ain't got no time for that. 
And. You ain't got ta cry dry, your eyes. We gon get through that 
Trust. We gon get through that 
95, like dat
