Gorillas Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


Hey guys 
Well, alright, Well, alright! Well, alright, 
We out this bitch yeah nigga 
 
Grocery store line, mama countin' them pennies 
Remember them days had to dine and dash at Denny's. 
Niggas wasn't eatin' when your
stomach get that empty. 
You might have to move and shake just to get some Shake'n Bake, 
Top Ramen
