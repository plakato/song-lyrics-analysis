Rebound Lyrics
by Volbeat.

It's a shame that you don't know me cuz I never.
Made it past the third string.
My coach never gave me a chance he's always.
Blowing his whistle at me.
Put me in your game and I promise not to shoot.
A three I'll stick with twos.
I don't wanna make a steal unless you make a pass.
I'll never personal foul you.

Did you have to give your boyfriend all my letters.
I didn't know he was six foot eight.
He shoved me inside a locker and I ended up on the rebound.
I called time out it was too late.
