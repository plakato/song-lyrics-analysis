Greatest Part of Me Lyrics
by Virtue.


Will I ever find the words to thank you for all you've done for me?
On the cross you paid my penalty, from the grave you rose to set me fee.
When I didn't choose to love you, you made the choice to love me.
I present my body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to you.

I am yours, you are mine, and forever you will live inside of me.
Forever yours, I will praise you endlessly.
I'm in you, you're in me. Inseparable through all eternity. I know that you.
will always be the greatest part of me.
You will always be the greatest part of me.

I could never turn from you, if I did where would I go.
Only you can give me piece of mind, you're the greater light that fills my.
soul.
I could spend more than a lifetime counting the ways you love me.
I'll live to be your expression, waiting with great expectations.
I am longing for the day you come back for me.

I present my body as a living sacrifice.
Holy and acceptable to you.
