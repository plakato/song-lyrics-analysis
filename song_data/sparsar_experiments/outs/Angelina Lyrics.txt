Angelina Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Johnny held a picture of you 
Yeah. He kissed it and threw it away. 
Discarded on the avenue 
Just. Like all those letters that you threw away, 
, 
Oh Angelina, you lied, 
Oh Angelina, you did it and smiled 
Oh Angelina. You went to the town hall, dance, 
With, your hair pulled back and a dress. 
 
Johnny took an airplane back 
Shuffled his feet on the street in L.A 
Two hundred dollars and a gunny sack 
He bought a guitar and sang with a band 
 
And. He sang 
Oh Angelina, you lied, 
Oh Angelina, you did it and smiled 
Oh Angelina. You went to the town hall, dance, 
With, your hair pulled back and a dress. 
 
Well job's hard enough. When you ain't got a girl 
And the weekend won't leave you alone, 
And, with money to spare and with nights at the end 
Till. He ends up at a pay telephone, 
, 
Said, 
Oh Angelina. You lied, 
Oh Angelina, you did it and smiled 
Oh Angelina. You went to the town hall, dance, 
With, your hair pulled back and a dress, 
Oh Angelina. You lied, 
Oh Angelina, you did it and smiled 
Oh Angelina, I'm tired. It'S the end of the night 
Yeah. It'S the end of the line
