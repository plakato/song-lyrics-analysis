Let Me Fall Lyrics
by Wood.

As I drove off one evening, for the last time I'm leaving.
I had to pull over cause something was changing.
While the wind screen was wiping off the rain that kept falling.
I thought about nothing, yeah, I thought about living.
Bitterness is sweet cause it's funny after all.
Now you've got me to my feet, just let me fall.
Right now I'm dreaming that I'm back at my place.
Changing my keys to my old front door.
Turning around and talking, pretending once more.
Bitterness is sweet cause it's funny after all.
Now you've got me to my feet, just let me fall.
I've been holding on too tight, always waiting on your call.
Now we both know you're right so let me fall, let me fall.
After a while I began my journey home.
Dreadin' that moment when on my stairs I'll be all alone.
Dangling my keys in my old front door.
And turning around and talking and pretending once more.
That am I only doing what I expect myself to do.
You know sometimes it's hard to tell what is it isn't true.
Or am I living out a liar off for someone else?
Or is this just me beneath it all? I just don't know anymore.
Bitterness is sweet cause it's funny after all.
Now you've got me to my feet, just let me fall.
I've been holding on too tight and always waiting on your call.
Now we both know you're right so let me fall, let me fall.
