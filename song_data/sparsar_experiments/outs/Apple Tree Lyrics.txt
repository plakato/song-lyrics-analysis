Apple Tree Lyrics
by Wolfmother.


Dear Sir, can you remember me.
I'm the one that picked the apple tree.
Dear Sir, can you remember me.
I'm the one that picked the apple tree.

Dear Sir, can you remember me.
Have a look inside the family tree.
Dear Sir, can you remember me.
Have a look inside the family tree.

Your daughter is so fine to see.
Unraveled some mystery in me.
When i see the apple in disguise.
Ohh my love i can recognize.

Dear Sir, can you remember me.
I'm the one that picked the apple tree.
Dear Sir, can you remember me.
I'm the one that picked the apple tree.

Dear Sir, can you remember me.
I seen the forest for the tree.
Dear Sir, can you remember me.
I seen the forest for the tree.

Your daughter is so fine to see.
Unraveled some mystery in me.
When i see the apple in disguise.
Ohh my love i can recognize.

Dear Sir, can you remember me.
I'm the one that picked the apple tree.
Dear Sir, can you remember me.
I'm the one that picked the apple tree.
