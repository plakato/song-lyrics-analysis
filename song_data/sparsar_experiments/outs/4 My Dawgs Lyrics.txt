4 My Dawgs Lyrics
by Tyga.


Cry little sister 
Thou shall not fall. 
Come come to your brother. 
Thou shall not fly 
 
This for my dawgs out here: goin' crazy, 
Goin', crazy, goin', crazy 
This for my dawgs out here: goin' crazy, 
Goin', crazy, goin', crazy 
This for my dawgs out here. Goin', crazy 
Fuck, you pay me fuck! You pay me 
This for my dawgs out here: goin' crazy, 
Goin', crazy fuck. You pay me 
This for my dawgs out here: 
 
Now, you wan na, be friends 
You the type to fuck, a nigga for his pension 
All a nigga ever wanted was a 6 Benz 
And. If you a bad bitch, come get the dick again 
They be like ...: oh wait, 
Step up in the spot and they screamin'. Oh aye 
Which, one of y'all wan na chill OJ 
We sippin', Moet, champagne. 
On me all the bitches on me: 
 
Cry little sister 
Thou shall not fall. 
Come come to your brother. 
Thou shall not fly 
 
This for my dawgs out here: goin' crazy, 
Goin', crazy, goin', crazy 
This for my dawgs out here; goin' crazy, 
Goin', crazy, goin', crazy 
This for my dawgs out here, goin' brazy, 
Goin', crazy fuck. You pay me 
You ain't alone out here. I'M goin' crazy, 
I'm right there with you 
We right here with you. 
 
I met some models. They said life full of obstacles, 
Challenges and mobster rules and Libyan size, pools 
Hold my breath and take 2 anxieties and robberies. 
Survival threats. Apologies! I made it through the poverty 
I be ... on my own shit 
Cause. You never never know. When somebody gon' trip 
Oh shit miss a nigga with that bullshit man, 
Aye bossman, I'm my own bossman understand 
 
Cry little sister 
Thou shall not fall. 
Come come to your brother 
Thou shall not fly 
 
This for my dawgs out here. Goin' cray-cray 
Goin' cray-cray got that AK 
Point it at your bay-bay. We goin' crazy, 
We, goin', crazy fuck. You pay me 
This for my dawgs out here: goin' crazy, 
We, goin', crazy fuck. You pay me 
For my dawgs out here: goin' crazy, 
Goin', crazy, yeah, 
 
T-Y-G-A. We goin' crazy, 
Young Young Young Mula, baby 
Goin', crazy, goin', crazy 
Fuck. You pay me fuck! You pay me 
 
This, for my dawgs out here: goin' crazy, 
Goin', crazy, goin', crazy 
This for my dawgs out here. Goin' crazy, 
Goin', crazy. They goin' crazy, 
 
Cry little sister 
Thou shall not fall. 
Come come to your brother. 
Thou shall not fly .
 
Unchain me. Sister 
Thou shall not steal. 
Love is with your brother 
Thou, shall not kill
