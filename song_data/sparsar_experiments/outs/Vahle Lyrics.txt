Vahle Lyrics
by Volumes.

All my life.
I can't define.
This single instant.
This graphic moment.
To step foot on this.
To step foot on this.

You'll never know.
You're the reason I came.
I cannot do this without you.
No, I never doubt you.
But I feel like you don't feel the same way.

Now you're buried underneath.
Gone but never forgotten.
James Vahle.

I was young.
An inquisition of who I would become.
Who I see in myself.
When the gravel got loose.
And you were just trying to help me.

Loved ones.
Afterlife is something that you think about.
When you're caught up in that moment.
That moment you don't wanna dream about.

When you want something more.
And she said I was stuck.
And I should have pulled you out of that truck.
I'm sorry, it's my summer.

2x.
We've been saying.
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
I've been waiting.
Staring at the floor.
Staring at the phone.

Now you're buried underneath.
Gone but never forgotten.
James Vahle.

I don't often think about regret.
And what it means to me.
I will always have all respect.
About what you mean to me.

Why the fuck couldn't you have left it in the driveway?
I knew it.
I would have picked you up.
I would have been there.
Why the fuck couldn't you have left it in the driveway?
I can see you.
Now every time I turn the corner all I'm gonna think about is.

Loved ones.
Afterlife is something that you think about.
When you're caught up in that moment.
That moment you don't wanna dream about.

When you want something more.
And she said I was stuck.
And I should have pulled you out of that truck.
I'm sorry, it's my summer.

2x.
We've been saying.
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
I've been waiting.
Staring at the floor.
Staring at the phone.
