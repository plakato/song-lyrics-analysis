A Measure of Life Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

She held a thrift store pose with Cure on the stereo.
A pastor for the scene.
The way she stood on her toes for songs that she didn't know.
And lyrics kids can't read.
She was pretty in pink with sleeves like an artifact.
Multiplied the treason.
But he was holding her hand with claws like a weatherman.
I'll wait another season.
Please stand here for a minute.
I'll find a way to make it.
And cross that frozen garden line.
Please wait here for a minute.
I'll find a way to leave it.
I'll find a way to make you hurt.
When the borders long gone and we're reunited.
You won't break for me.
When our secret of love is drowned on the stereo.
Just choose the wedding theme.
Now you swear you're back with eyes that can haunt me.
And bruises left on your knees.
Just a punk rock queen lost in your coronation.
This night belongs to me.
Please stand here for a minute.
I'll find a way to make it.
And cross that frozen garden line.
Please wait here for a minute.
I'll find a way to leave it.
I'll find a way to make you hurt.
In a moment they're gone and I'm left and holding.
It takes a moment.
Leave your name on the stereo.
And you don't know what it's like.
Just stand on your toes and watch me, watch me go.
Just stand on your toes for lyrics you didn't know.
Just stand on your toes and watch me, watch me go.
