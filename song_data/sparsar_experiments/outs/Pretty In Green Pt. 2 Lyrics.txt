Pretty In Green Pt. 2 Lyrics
by Tyler Tracey.


Pretty in green, she be pretty in green.
Everywhere I go she give me that dream.
Every single night all I need is a light.
She's my only one, she's my only Queen.

Every single night I spark up with that light.
It's dark in my room but she shines so bright.
She stays so grounded while I take flight.
The only one I let come around when I'm out of sight.
She be pretty in green, pretty in green.
With her around everything looking like a dream.
Wearing that green dress with the purple stream.
She calms me down when I just wanna scream.
I first met her when I was just fifteen.
But we didn't get serious until I was eighteen.
She was so young but she had the experience.
The way she made me feel left me more curious.
Just one touch on my lips and I knew.
I said Baby, I don't want anyone but you.
She just leaned in and gave me another kiss.
And I knew I was entering into her eternal bliss.

I don't know how I got here.
I don't know where I am.
I can't remember who I am.
Am I high enough yet?

Every time we start to dance I get lost in time.
It's as if she's always living in my mind.
She's not like her sisters, I fucked them first.
They fucked me over, almost had me riding in an hearse.
But now I'm sleeping beside the beautiful Mary Jane.
She makes it seem so personal when I know she's screwing my gang.
She wears what I ask her to and she never leaves unless she has too.
But every time she does she always whispers I Love You.

Where am I?
Where are you?
Why won't you answer me?
Am I high enough yet?
I don't like this.
This doesn't feel right.
When does it end?
Am I high enough yet?
