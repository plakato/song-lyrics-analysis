Anniversary Lyrics
by Voltaire.

Do I look the same to you?
Cause I don't feel so.
You know everything must change.
As time goes by.
Though it feels like yesterday.
When we first met.
I feel I'm sinking deeper.

Do you look the same to me?
Well I don't think so.
Cause you know everything must change.
As time goes by.
Like the flowers that dry.
Locking inside.
Forever their beauty.
Beauty.

And they said this feeling fades.
It gets stronger everyday.
And they say that beauty fades.
You're more beautiful than ever.
They said we'd drift away.
We're still standing here.
And it feels like every day's.
Our Anniversary.

Well I stumble through the dark.
And light a candle.
And the path the wax will take.
No one can know.
And you said it looked like snow.
Or maybe clouds.
And I think it looks like Heaven.

So we make it into a ring.
And make a mold.
And we melt above the flames.
The whitest gold.
When hot and cold collide.
What's left in place.
Is forever and ever.

And they said our love would fade.
It gets stronger everyday.
And they say that beauty fades.
You're more beautiful than ever.
They said we'd drift away.
We're still standing here.
And it feels like every day's.
Our Anniversary.

Some say things worth having.
Take some time.
As they get older.
They get better.

La lalala lalalala....

And they said our love would fade.
It gets stronger everyday.
And they say that beauty fades.
You're more beautiful than ever.
They said we'd drift away.
We're still standing here.
And it feels like every day's.
Our Anniversary.

And they said our love would fade.
It gets stronger everyday.
And they say that beauty fadesâ€”.
You're more beautiful than ever.

They said we'd drift away.
Well as long as we're together.
It feels like every day's.
Our Anniversary.
