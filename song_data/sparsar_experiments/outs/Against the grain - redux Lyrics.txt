Against the grain - redux Lyrics
by UNKLE.

A cut of the wrist.
Don't leave me strength.
There's an arrow only I can take.
Cover the marks.
Don't leave me strength.
Hold me while I lose my grip.
Don't look up, you can save yourself.
Don't look right, there ain't anybody else.
Don't cry out, don't expose your name.
You gotta kick against the grain.
Don't look up, you can save yourself.
Don't look right, there ain't anybody else.
Don't look up, you can mark your name.
Don't look down, you're against the grain.
You're losing yourself behind the face that you created.
You're losing your head inside of all that you created.
You're losing your feet above the world that you created.
You created.
You created.
Don't look up, you can save yourself.
Don't look right, there ain't anybody else.
Don't cry out, don't expose your name.
You gotta keep against the grain.
Don't look up, you can save yourself.
Don't look right, there ain't anybody else.
Don't look up, you can mark your grave.
Don't look down, you're against the grain.
Hold me when I lose my grip.
I really need you.
Hold me when I lose my grip.
I know I'll need you.
You know I'll need you.
You know I'll need you.
