No Love To Give Lyrics
by United States of America.

Summer is.
And summer blues.
Summer do come surely.
I.
I have no love to give.
I just have to get around.
I happen to be learning.
I.
I have no love to give.
Dont ask me why.
Why I dont know.
I have no love to give.
Dont ask me why.
Why I dont know.
I have no love to give.
If you think that Ill be coming running back tomorrow.
Just to refrain.
I have no love to give.
Boy you think I mean it when I say it yours to borrow.
Just to commend.
I have no love to give.
Dont ask me why.
Why I dont know.
I have no love to give.
Dont ask me why.
Why I dont know.
I have no love to give.
Talking about a man who says to me Im very weltered.
But though my dear.
I have no love to give.
Seems to me hes making noises like someones been jilted.
Look at here.
I have no love to give.
Dont ask me why.
Why I dont know.
I have no love to give.
Dont ask me why.
Why I dont know.
I have no love to give.
