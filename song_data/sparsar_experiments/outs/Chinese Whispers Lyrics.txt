Chinese Whispers Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


Listen, look, I don't fear words but still my ears burn.
People conversate but never share what they've heard.
They're only talking, they're over-courting, pure hype.
Your life seems to be so important at all times.
Look I can hear it in the air because the talk flies.
Then I had to hand myself in because the wolves cry.
But will they wipe my son's tears when he falls? I.
Don't think so but they still wanna talk, why?
Cuh that's the culture of the roads what we walk by.
Fought by, ran from feds and got caught by.
And the all-time problem when it's all lies.
The bullshit's always the centre of the bullseye.

Hey look, despite these prisoners.
They persist with the Chinese whispers and turn these victims to victors.
But karma flies by like a discus.
This cycle is vicious.

My ears are burning, not cause I make CDs dead.
I sense it, my ex is wishing me dead, bitch.
Yo, hold on one sec Wretch.
The labels are saying I'm next.
And the whole scene's saying I'm a threat.
They're waiting to hear my album.
A sneak preview, I might 'llow dem.
But only fam get to hear G.
They might switch their style if they hear me.
They rate me, clearly.
Hold on, is that what they're on?
My ears are starting to heat up.
I've got a tune, I need it to generate hype.
Um, let's give Chipmunk a feature.
That's funny talk.
If you ain't fam I don't rate you as an artist.
Know that money talks.
I only fuck with the best of the best.
I.E. that's why I'm here with Wretch.
Woo, my ears are on fire.
Woo - normal, they're saying I'm on fire.
We hold what the UK require.

I'm gonna live a long time.
Cuh I can run rap and still be sitting on grime.
So their views ain't new to me.
They say Wretch ain't mad like he used to be.
So let's get back to the way things were.
And we'll see who's a G.
Cuh I was the talk of the room.
Way before I recorded a tune.
And since Channel U 635.
Bro, I think I'm so nice.
No, I'm pissed, just so right.
And by the way the single's sold fine.
And if I wanted a huge success.
Then I'd have just done the tune at the end.
But that ain't being true to the Wretch.
I'd rather prove I'm the best.
But these fools are still itching to see me fall.
But a fall won't break me, the talk don't phase me.
Cuh I can take it all.
Cuh I am Bruce Willis, unbreakable.
You Samuel L actors are fake, you frauds.
Look, I've been hearing the whispers.
But it's all air in the distance.
