My City Lyrics
by Sycosis.

My City.

This Chicago, You Sleeping I Know.
But this the Windy City do it big's the motto.
And this My city yeah  This My city yeeaaah.
This my city yeah  This My city yeeaaah.

This is Chi-Town, Them Killers Ride Round.
And They be beefing all summer til it die down.
But this My city yeah  This My city yeeeah.
This My city yeah  This My city yeeeah.

Look look 93rd and Cottage Grove.
Ramen noodles on that stove/.
Cooking like I'm Jeezy think Im Yeezy.
With these kind of clothes/.
Check my kicks they kinda cold.
Momma couldn't afford them/.
But I'm grown now I can sport them.
Look Jordan ain't got these Jordans/.
Yeah they fusions don't confuse them.
Getting W's yall niggas loosing/.
These facts in fact they proven.
The city packed them blacks and moved them/.
So we out here in these burbs fam.
Living off these words fam/.
We be in the streets too deep.
You barely off the curb fam/.

Look look Madison and Laramie.
What you think you scaring me/.
I grew up in this jungle.
Where D boys got packs and bundles/.
They be serving they be serving.
Got no jobs but say they working/.
Cops swerving and swerving.
Leave em in that country hurting/.
Let me take you up to Lake Shore.
North Pole to be exact/.
Red Line to Howard Train.
Where niggas posted by the tracks/.
Back down to the Low End.
But now they call it Bronzeville/.
Heat beat the Bulls.
Won't find nobody in Lebron's still/.
Sibley and Halsted.
Wild Hundreds we lost it/.
Walked in Arnie's 100 singles.
Fell in love and tossed it/.
Damn her ass enormous.
Now we flying down Torrence/.
Made a left on Stony Island.
Need a Gym Shoe Sub I'm on it/.
You say choosing we say going.
And she Going so I'm blowing/.
All this money for no reason.
We only got 2 seasons/.
Summer time and winter time.
And both them bitches fierce/.
You like heat waves or snow storms.
Get both them bitches here.
Cuz this Chicago.

Look look 55th and Lake Park.
You might find you a skate park/.
55th in Gage Park.
You might catch you a case dog/.
Kings and Folks be beefing.
Que paso, ya tu fuiste/.
Way to far in that hood.
Now make it home won't be easy/.
Let me take you to Rogers Park.
Up into that Gold Coast/.
Never seen a condo cost more.
So bring lots of dough/.
This the home of Lupe,Kanye.
Common, Kels, plus Twista/.
If they said they fucking with us.
They was probably fucking with ya/.
