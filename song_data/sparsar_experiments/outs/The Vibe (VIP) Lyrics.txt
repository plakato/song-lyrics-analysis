The Vibe (VIP) Lyrics
by The Yung Fusion.


I be that young rapping dude 
Might just trap with you 
Coming with the thunder baby 
Might, just clap, ya' crew, 
I roll out in the morning light 
Whip that Harley bike 
All black, i'm the party type 
-and it's on tonight. 
I just stepped no weapons 
But. My outfit might take ya soul 
See my presence, impressive, 
Got strippers, slipping off of poles 
I just whip. Then I swerve em 
Wish. You would i'm Timmy Tuner 
Turned her to a carnivore 
Now. She treat me like a burger 
 
I, don't their names, but they all wan na ride. 
All this energy around me, I feel so alive. 
This - must be the vibes x3 
Cause, I feel so alive. 
 
I got a fresh cut in the denims 
All. These sexy genes, in my section 
And if a nigga wan na run up 
Boy, get done up by the Confessor, damn 
Slide into yo DM's in the pm and am 
Then. I slide into your feelings. 
When, you see just what I'm saying: 
I ain't ever tryna front. 
Imma' show you girl, wassup 
You can show me what is love 
Then we ride of in the sun 
Damn. This must be movie cause. We directing the fun 
And producing weekend: music 
But the credits, never come, 

Speakers popping like soda 
Make, em turn up and over 
I'm. The slickest in here 
Thats why she kissing the cobra 
And, I feel so alive. 
All these girls going wild 
And its all in my jungle, 
I see they all feeling vibes 
So bring yo girl
