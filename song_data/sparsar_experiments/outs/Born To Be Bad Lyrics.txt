Born To Be Bad Lyrics
by The Runaways.


Bodies without minds.
I hear you're the one with the bleeding heart.
Blue and bittersweet.
You tear my dreams apart.

Cause I was born to be bad.
I'm not sad.
And I'm glad I did it.
Born to be bad.
I'm not sad, why don't you all get with it.

The damned don't cry.
Cry out when they're betrayed.
Bodies slam they scream.
As the keynotes fade.

Cause I was born to be bad.
I'm not sad.
And I'm glad I did it.
Born to be bad.
I'm not sad, why don't you all get with it.

I called my mother from Hollywood the other day.
And I said Mom, I just called to tell ya I joined a rock and roll band.
And I won't be coming home no more.
You know what she did?
She started crying and weeping and whimpering like all mothers do.
She woke up my father and told him about it and he said.
There ain't a damn thing we can do, that's the way she is.
Hey, you know she was just born to be bad.

I want you to bring me his ears.
To satisfy my mad desires.
And if he bites the dust.
We'll just have to miss my fire.

Cause I was born to be bad.
I'm not sad.
And I'm glad I did it.
Born to be bad.
I'm not sad, why don't you all get with it.
