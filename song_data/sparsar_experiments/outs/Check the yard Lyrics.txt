Check the yard Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Check the yard for spots I missed they're clumping off and odorless.
You find examples all the time catch me at the scene of the crime.
And toe the line.
Toe the line.

Coddled.
Fuck off.

Dying for my neighborhood I'm grooving on your neighborhood.
We plumb the depths of four square miles for something we don't know yet.
How's it feel to know that?
How's it feel with success?
Don't answer that.

Chuck the card that bore the number.
Tear it up now torn asunder.
Turn away and turn and ask the audience are you having fun?
Don't answer that.
