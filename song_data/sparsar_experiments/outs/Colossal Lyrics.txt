Colossal Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

I saw the colossal landscape.
Of which I never was a part.
It was a magical day.
Of which Id never seen before.
The first time I saw colossal girl.
The first time I saw colossal girl.
Such glowing mountains before us.
Pillars of life all fade away.
Of all the things I need to say girl.
All of these woods are in my way.
The first time I saw colossal girl.
Well, she's running to the hills again.
Can you tell me if she'll ever return?
She must be mother natures child.
Cause she's runnin' to the call of the wild.
She's talkin' to the trees again.
Tellin' me that she's one of them.
Lookin' at the bird in the tree.
Though she's never gonna notice me, no.
Oh is my love a confession.
Will I just put it back today?
If I had a love to give you.
Would you still throw it all away?
The first time I saw colossal girl.
The first time I saw colossal girl.
Well, she's running to the hills again.
Can you tell me if she'll ever return?
'She must be mother natures child.
Cause she's runnin' to the call of the wild.
She's talkin' to the trees again.
Tellin' me that she's one of them.
Lookin' at the bird in the tree.
Though she's never gonna notice me.
Can you remember the first time we met.
Living together in colossal times.
Some things are given with no reason why.
Living together in colossal times.
I'm just a gypsy with wondering eyes.
I'll tell you secrets that send you to sleep.
All I can give you is all of my love.
These are the things I can give you to keep, oh.
I'm just a gypsy with wondering eyes.
I'll tell you secrets that send you to sleep.
All I can give you is all of my love.
And these are the things I can give you to keep.
