Hail Of The Tide Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.


Our vessel navigates over the ocean, forcing its way through the waves, the.
wind has no command here, no.
Hearts fiending for our destination, searching the skies to the west for signs.
of fair weather.
Gone are all reflections on burdens left far beyond these sweet shores.

Hey, follow the sails, follow the wake, follow the blazing stars.
Hey, follow the wind, follow the fates, follow your heart.

Seek passage safely through reefs to the harbor, mooring the ship in the bay,.
the lights that welcome us burn bright.
No words can express our elation, oh how it's good to be home, back in this.
town again.
Gone are all the memories of hardships endured whilst roaming the seas.

Hey, follow the sails, follow the wake, follow the blazing stars.
Hey, follow the wind, follow the fates, follow your heart.

Long are the days spent away from this anchorage.
Legends are all that remain when we depart again.
