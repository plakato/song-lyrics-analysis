All Y'all Lyrics
by Que.


Nigga flexin' but I know you pussy.
Hatin' on me but I know you lookin'.
Acting like a bitch, know you shouldn't.
I wish you would but I know you wouldn't.
Fuck all y'all y'all.
All y'all y'all y'all y'all.
All y'all y'all.
All y'all y'all, What?
Fuck all y'all y'all.
All y'all y'all y'all y'all.
All y'all y'all.
All y'all y'all y'all.
Fuck y'all.

These niggas salty and they know I know it.
Be pillow talking but they don't know I know it.
Be sneak dissin' and they don't know I know it.
But I don't give a shit cause I'm young and rich and I know they know it.

Niggas talk shit like hoes, niggas that's supposed to be bros.
They said bitches ain't loyal, Nah niggas ain't loyal.
They be quick to switch up like clothes.
It ain't the nigga with money that change,  it's the people.
that's around him.
When you down, niggas never hit you up.
But when you up, niggas always wanna down ya.
Niggas love to talk cash shit when they really broke.
Always actin' like they got it but they know they don't.
Love to flex for these bitches, can't lift a weight.
Swearin' up and down that they'll bust, but won't bust a grape.

Niggas be hatin' hard and they know I know it.
Be leasing cars and they don't know I know it.
Be wifin' bitches that they know they hoes even though they know it.
Buying fake gold and they don't even know it.
Same niggas supposed to be ya dog, be they same nigga actin' like a fraud.
Always pushing that loyal shit but turn around tryna talk to ya broad.
Always pushing that real shit but they'll snitch before they take that charge.
I don't trust these niggas, man what's up with these niggas.
Fuck these niggas, we ball.
Niggas always wanna hit the club and wanna get in free.
Always wanna valet when they shit on E.
Niggas always wanna try and compete.
And always end up going broke tryna shit on me.
