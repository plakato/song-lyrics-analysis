Bang Bang! Lyrics
by Swizz Beatz.

Swizz Beatz.
Showtime.
Pull your Aston Martin out and just swerve on ?em.
Pull your hoopty out man and just swerve on ?em.
Let the top drop back and just swerve on ?em.
Take the doors off your whip and just swerve on ?em.

Pharrell.
You can catch em swerving in that thing thing.
Riding in that thing thing.
Let the top drop and let the system bang bang.
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey.
Me and my bitches swerving in that thing thing.
Riding in that thing thing.
Let the blueberry blow let the system bang bang.
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey.

Pusha T.
Take ya tops off baby, it?s bout to pop off.
Young somersault in this bitch to want to cop off.
When you got the crown the haters want you to drop off.
Lil Pusha T?s in the game I simple knock off.
I beg your pardon, that coupe is a Targa.
I?ve been in and outta lanes with a Porsche playing frogger.
I?ll never be a blogger, I?m too much of a buyer.
Post it, don?t have it at your home, you?re a liar.
These niggas day dreamers, I?m more like a schemer.
To have from Iesha?s to Adrianna Lima?s.
Yeah, couple extra models for what we pop bottles for.
Leaning on the throttle more.

Swizz beatz.

This that shit that you knock in your drops.
The shit that you like to knock in your drops.
Well if you like me, this the shit you like to knock on your yachts.
Boat shoes on, walls full of Basquiats.
You ain't like me, you just automatic starting.
You like me, you design Aston Martin?s.
Bow ties on, I?m just GQ modelling.
Damn, fresh I am.
When I start scoring I shut down the Garden.
Swizzy Rule the World on my Nas and my Lauren.
Blogs say Swizzy bars ain't nothing to pause.
I say FREEZE!
Now pull your cars up next to ours.

Pusha T.
Where I?m from we don?t gang bang.
But we sell that thing thing.
Every ghetto same shit.
Just only the slang change.
Soon as that bass came we started to take aim.
Double G boat shoes, YSL case frames.
Club with the photoshoots.
Think Puffy and Mase came.
Dolled up the bitches too, they was in the same frame.
Hustlers they chased change, busta?s they chased dames.
Young niggas Kingpins we was tryna fame.
Niggas on they chaingang, snitches play the blame game.
First  in the room when they name names.
Hard for us to cross paths we ain't in the same lane.
Hope God forgive me when I catch niggas bang bang!
