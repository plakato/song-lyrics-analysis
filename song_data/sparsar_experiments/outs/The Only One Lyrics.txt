The Only One Lyrics
by Ruse.

Oh God, said I love the way that you do.
Didn't know what I wanted till I knew you.
Billions of women in the world and who knew.
There's a girl as beautiful as you. The only one I want.

Everyday.
I'm amazed. For Pete's sake.
You ain't just a sweet dame.
You beat sweet, exceed great.
Captivated, I'm knee-deep.
Fascinated and peachy.
And that's amazin. I'm wide awake.
But, goddamn, you're dreamy.
And there's not a man.
That'll rock your world like I can.
Not a girl I'd rather kiss.
I'm not missin this chance.
I got this. Plot twist.
You like me too. Honestly.
I'm surprised but the pieces fit.
And I'm not stoppin till you're mine.
Said, honestly I am surprised but I'm not stoppin till your mine.

Almost there.
You're aware we're a pair.
It's no fair. You tear open.
My heart and dispose of the cold air.
I like you.
Heart's warm when I'm beside you.
No one that I'm more nice to.
You improve my life. Make me see things in a.
New light. I know you know I'm right.
We talk like every night on Skype and that's no open mic. Is it?
No.
I'm in trouble; I'm an addict and I need another dose.
I'm havin withdrawals. I'm gonna go mad cause.
When you're right there, it's like I have no.
Worry in the world. Nope, just one girl.
That gets my heart in a knot and my stomach in a whirl.
Mark my words. Swear to God, you're a pearl.
And I'm not gonna stop till you're mine.
I'm sure.

I got you!
You said yes and I got you.
The best girl I've ever met.
She said yes! Better yet.
She's my best-friend. I'll never let.
You go. No, not ever. Let's go.
And take over this whole globe.
Me and you, together. Know.
You make me a better me.
Remember that if you ever think.
You're anything less than the best thing.
To ever happen to me cause you're perfect, actually.
