Pick Your Head Up Lyrics
by Xazz.


She walks faster than you ever thought, because the answer is you don't know.
The one thing that you never thought, is that your feelings might not show.
Fight tough for the little ones, cause they're the ones who gonna call your.
bluff.
Speak softly if you ever do, because of course you don't sing enough.

Don't stick your head out from behind the door.
Cause, you're just gonna find what's there before.
Reach out, speak out, live out loud.
Pick your head up.

It's not fun to get up again, when no one's there to see what you have done.
My mom said that it wasn't fair, how only children have all the fun.
Strong fists but broken wings, and how're you ever gonna get that far?
Don't matter who or what you been, long as you're happy with where you are.

Don't stick your head out from behind the door.
Cause, you're just gonna find what's there before.
Reach out, speak out, live out loud.
Pick your head up.

Pick your head up.
You got to pick your, pick your.
You got to pick your head up.
Oh, oh.
Yeah, ah.
You got to pick your head up.
Because you know, oh oh, oh oh.

Standing inside, you leave the world behind.
You feel ostracized, because it's judgement time.
For you.
Standing inside, you leave the world behind.
You feel ostracized, because it's judgement time.
For you.
Standing inside, you leave the world behind.
You feel ostracized, because it's judgement time.
For you.
Standing inside, you leave the world behind.
You feel ostracized, because it's judgement time.
For you.
Standing inside, you leave the world behind.
You feel ostracized, because it's judgement time.
For you.
Standing inside, you leave the world behind.
You feel ostracized, because it's judgement time.
For you.
