Message From the Stars Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


The air is now on fire, in dying sunlight.
A full display of colors leaking in between.
Just look up to the sky, the one we're under.
I'm looking up there, too.

The world is now alive in rising starlight.
Reflecting all our wishes up and to the moon.
The galaxies collide, in perfect power.
Like fireworks for us all.

Wait for me outside.
That's where I'll be, where the stars belong.
Though our paths divide, we'll journey freely.
Where the stars belong, so long.

The outer realms of space are cold and empty.
Forgotten all the warmer things since it's begun.
Still dreaming of that place, of stars and treetops.
I'll get to it someday.

The air is now on fire, in living sunrise.
A full display of colors leaking in between.
Just look up to the sky, the one you're under.
I'm looking up there, too.
