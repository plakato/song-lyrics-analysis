Aye ge- get that out the trunk ... 
It's in the front, not the back ... 
Nah.. 
Yeah, that's them right. There, ..., 
Iight.., 
Iight close it back. ... 
Let's go 
Come on 
 
Little to a lot 
Countin figures in the backseat 
Foreign women. Next to me, tryna match 3 
 
My niggas get the guap 
 Got ta question. U can ask me 
Pullin out the lot finna cruise down, ashby 
 
Little to a lot 
Road running like a track meet 
Run the streets, but I never been a athlete. 
Ima drop my top speed racing down the back street 
Wit two freaks. They just tryna climb the cash tree, 
 
Little to a lot 
In the parkin lot, Doin donuts 
Asiago box 
I can't Drop the top 
This a loaner 
Audemar piguet wit. The icy rocks, 
That's corona, 
Misguided niggas askin me to filament 
Ain't, say fill em in know. My scholars Feelin this 
Bumpin ye lookin like a brick of yay 
Smellin like a brick of 
It's. My time it's tickin, 
Speakin up so listen 
Needa, slip permission 
For these lessons. Im givin 
Rookie of the year next year, 
But 
This gear 
Will excuse for the wait. 
Just make sure? U know the code when you pullin in my gate, 
Nigga got his own estate 
My initials in my plate, 
Pappadeaux. I order steak 
Feet up chillin by the lake 
Spike lee modern day, 
For the love of the game. 
Swear a nigga goes off, 
Tryna get my shows off 
Jeep 4 door, wit the doors off 
She, inside wit, her clothes off 
 
Little to a lot 
Money talk, 
That's, my favorite topic, 
I, don't know the cost 
If I see it. Then I'm coppin 
Burberry to my boxers 
And. She love plaid 
She. Call me daddy, don't know her dad 
Treat YA, favorite rapper, like a mattress pad 
Treat ya, girlfriend like a trampoline 
Don't, know her name, but she know the team. 
Lil nigga got big dreams: 
Grande 
Main girl, beyonce 
Swear, my flow beyond, say: 
So, it's destiny. Child 
These niggas is showin. Respect to me now 
And. I ain't made it it's crazy, 
Women askin for what's left of me now 
Why they got ta, be so shady 
They gone. Love me for my ambition: 
Drive retarted, stupid man and I ain't talkin transmission. 

Now. I see a lil clearer. 
I only see my competition when I'm lookin in the mirror, 
Moncler look vanilla, 
Throw it up to the ceiling. 
Willie beamen 
Diamonds, gleamin, 
Models, dancing, 
I'm preheating, 
Triple, double that's preseason 
Numbers on the board 
Colder than before. 
Look at my decor 
I deserve awards 
 
Little to a lot 
Climbin charts 
Swear, I'm biggie baby 
Ima call up droc 
We gone shop, 
I swear, I'm living crazy 
Stuck inside my dorm 
Makin music got ta nigga torn 
Made. A couple hits burned: a disc 
Tell me who to warn 
Thousand dollar fit yea 
Break my wrist yea 
Said ya. Rollie was legit, yea heard a tick yea 
Fge, the clique yea 
From, the 6 yea 
Make clothes n. He spit yea. He so lit yea 
No limit records, 
Jesus piece on my necklace 
Eat beats just for breakfast 
Jerome bettis after lettuce. I could never fumble 
Look into a dreamer eyes and tell me I ain't, humble 
Changin, rearranging rap 
40 oz. That'S my thinkin cap 
I think that the rap savior's back 
In n out peekaboo 
Parlaying wit, a freak or two 
Designer shoes. I keep a few 
Black n white give em beetle juice, 
Black n white mikes, give em beetle juice, 
Black n white mikes, give em beetle *whoooo*
