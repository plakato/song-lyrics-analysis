Stand Your Ground Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

They meet once a year.
Below crystal chandeliers.
In an exhibition of wealth.
They will destroy the night and the day.
They are here to present to us all.
A new world, a new beginning.
But in truth they were never chosen to control.
Anything at all.
Just stand your ground like before.
Don't let them change you.
Just stand your ground like before.
Don't let them change you.
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake.
Just stand your ground like before.
Don't let them change you.
Just stand your ground like before.
Don't let them change you.
Their vision will interfere.
With the moon and the sun.
And the stars in the sky.
So gather your strength.
And believe in yourself.
Just stand your ground like before.
Don't let them change you.
Just stand your ground like before.
Don't let them change you.
Just stand your ground like before.
Don't let them change you.
Just stand your ground like before.
Don't let them change you.
