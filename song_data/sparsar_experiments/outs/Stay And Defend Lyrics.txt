Stay And Defend Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Stay And Defend.

Everybody always seems to talk about.
The night of the hills on fire.
Create a hype and then turn it around.
You've turned me into a conspire.

What to do, who to see?
I can tell a joke but this one's on me.
Now i'm falling down, falling out.
Falling backwards, farther behind you.

Don't go, don't be tired.
You gave a word then you set it on fire.
But I've forgiven in the end.
Maybe we run, or maybe we stay and defend.
Stay and defend.

Now everybody always seems to talk about.
The sun setting in the west.
Do we give up and just enjoy the lights?
And say we did our best; we did our best.

What to do, who to see?
When we both know that we can't agree.
Now i'm falling down, falling out.
Falling backwards, don't be falling backwards now.

Don't go, don't be tired.
You gave a word then you set it on fire.
But I've forgiven in the end.
Maybe we run, or maybe we stay and defend.

Don't go, don't go.
Stay and defend.
Don't go - stay and defend.
Don't go - stay and defend.

Now everybody always seems to talk.
About the night of the hills on fire.

Don't go, don't be tired.
You gave a word then you set it on fire.
Oh, I've forgiven in the end.
Maybe we run, or maybe we stay and defend.

Don't go - don't go!
Don't be tired - don't be tired!
You gave a word - yeah you gave a word!
Set it on fire - set it on fire!
Oh, i've forgiven in the end.
Maybe we run, or maybe we stay and defend.
