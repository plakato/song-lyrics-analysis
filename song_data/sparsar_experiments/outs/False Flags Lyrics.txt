False Flags Lyrics
by United Nations.

If we were being honest, I'd tell you I don't know how much more I'd take:.
Every morning, thinking of the junk I could be shooting into my veins,.
laughing at this black  joke. The joke, it's not funny anymore:.

The violent defilement of the weak animals.
And the silent compliant approval of the powerful.

Please don't take these things too seriously.
They are nothing but false flags.
Sorry. Sucker.
