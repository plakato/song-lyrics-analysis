Jordan Lyrics
by Visual.

Newspaper clipping, Chicago Suntimes.
Ill type of picture, its stuck in my mind.
Me in the background, looking like alright.
I swear to god, I can never forget that night.
Isaac Hayes was alive, he sat two rows behind.
Crazy, Carmen Electra was to my right.
And Sinbad was there, yup he was close by.
I even had better seats than Jesse Jackson that night.
They captured a legend in mid flight.
Clutching the ball, greatest player of all time.
Eeee ... Signature elbow &amp; knee brace.
Bugging, about to spike the ball on dudes face !
Yup, 23 in the air but naw not dunk'in.
Looking at Mark Jackson and thinks I'm gonna punk him!
Insanity, United Center was on fire !
If I ain't have the pic, you'd prolly think I was a liar !
But look G, huh, that ain't never been me.
And trust it joe, this is right from my memory.
I've got two autographs, to me they are priceless.
And I ain't gonna front I never wore no NIKES.
I swear to god, I might be the only dude from the GO.
That never rested his feet on Jordan soles.
But I guarantee, I am in tune with Jordan's soul.
He was born in Brooklyn but that dude is so GO !
Mikes competitive level was out ta control.
Work ethic, charisma and yeah, a bit of an asshole.
And those are the three reasons I relate so well.
Because I am here &amp; I am here to give my competition hell!
And I fight through pain throughout this whole game.
Made my own lane &amp; play my own way.
Respect to the greatest baller of all time.
Thank you for the inspiration, the pleasure was all mine.
