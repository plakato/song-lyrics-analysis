52 Lyrics
by Wordsplayed.


And Lord knows that my head was turnin'.
I guess I got a thing for these foreign women.
Black, white, Asian, and Latina.
I'm just tryna serve my sister like Venus versus.
Serena.
Hate religion cause they all wylin'.
They talkin' black Jesus, give me white diamonds.
They talkin' white Jesus ? Martin.
Pass the ?, pass a plate if you want the pardon.
Chivalry is dead and my God's alive.
These memories of Taylor got me mesmerized.
My sister told me not to get infatuated.
But it's been a couple years since I.
graduated.
Cold winter when I learn my lessons.
But this a summer that I ain't forgettin'.
My team came 'round, Rich sent the blessings.
And I scuffed by Uptown's dancin' at the wedding, wooh!

Break.
Yeah, just keep lettin' it play.
Yeah, just keep goin'.

This life gon' do what it do.
So I'm prayin' for the weak like we 52.
This life gon' do what it do.
I'm prayin' for the weak, call it 52.

And joy told me not be afraid.
Cause the king found me, call it D Wade.

Provision ain't enough so I called provider.
All she know is kiss and makeup.
Guess that's why she on her hundredth.
breakup.
And no one told her she pretty under that.
makeup.
Started from the bottom and found the ladder of.
Jacob.
Now the saints climbed in the palace.
Someone get the wine, pour it in the chalice.
Someone break a loaf, pass it to the.
baddest.
Have pity on your son, shouts to No.
Malice.
Last breath, no regrets.
Are y'all gon' beg like Keith Sweat?
Hands in the air like your 'sposed to.
He the lion, we the cubs, Sammy Sosa.

This life gon' do what it do.
So I'm prayin' for the weak like we 52.
This life gon' do what it do.
I'm prayin' for the weak, call it 52.
