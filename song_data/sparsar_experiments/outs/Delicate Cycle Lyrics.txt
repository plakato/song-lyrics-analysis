Delicate Cycle Lyrics
by The Uncluded.


I can take my finger off old dog old trick. 
New twist like actually take the finger off 
Wrap it in a blanket as you would a severed horse head. 
Mail it to a friend you wan na pinky swear more with and 
Should. They need a forearm or something they can practice. Drawing skulls on
 
Cut it from the shoulder
while. The saw's warm 
The full appendage really make a world of difference. 
Included, too, are 30 teeth to chew out. All your critics, 
32 would have been perfect. 2 were casualties of it's it's- 
I always wanted radder things for Christmas. 
The rest were cool 
I'm shipping out a torso in the a.m. 
You should learn to hit the organs every time at 40 paces. It'S important
 
I can't explain why now, by the way, 
Legs in a crate delivery by today, 
If a uniformed man knock knocks sign. His document 
You shouldn't, have to walk out to the mailbox for the other shit 
 
My mom was a lunch lady when I was in elementary school. 
She was outside during recess. 
She had a whistle, and I thought that that was cool. 
She was really nice to all the kids, who didn't have a lot of friends. 
She would give them hugs and tell them jokes or she'd play catch with them
 
And. My dad worked at the laundromat, which was really cool to me. 
I'D get to open up the washing machines, 
And clean them out and collect the money. 
And I'd, open, soap, dispenser and put new little boxes of soap inside 
I knew how it worked, and I was good at it. 
And, helping out filled me with a sense of pride 
I would meet all kinds of people there and I would look them in the eye. 
And I'd say: Hi Excuse me, but do you mind 
If? I shine the glass while your clothes dry,
