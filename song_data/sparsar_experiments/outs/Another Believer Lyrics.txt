Another Believer Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

Hello, I got something to tell you
But it's crazy. I got something to show you
So give me just one more chance, one more glance
And. I will make of you another believer

Guess, what You got more than you bargained
Ain't it crazy. You got more than you paid for
So. Give me just one more chance: one more glance
One more hand to hold

You've been on my mind, though it may seem, I'm fooling
Wasting so much time, though it may seem, I'm fooling
What. Are we gon na do? What are we gon na do about it? 

Another believer

So, then? That is all for the moment
Until next time. Until then, do not worry
And give me just one more chance, one more glance
And I will make of you yeah, I'm gon na make of you another believer

You've been on my mind, though it may seem. I'M fooling
Wasting so much time thought it may seem. I'M fooling
What. Are we gon na do? What are we gon na do about it? 

Hello I got something to tell you ooh another believer
Hello. I got something to show you ooh. Another believer
You've been on my mind, seem I'm fooling
Wasting so much time. One more time

You've been on my mind, though it may seem, I'm fooling
Wasting so much time, though it may seem, I'm fooling
