Gucci Said Lyrics

I'mma dawg just like Gucci said.
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed.
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head.
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red.
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said.
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said.
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed.
I'm still a dawg, still dawg just like Gucci said.

I'm a dawg, like all my dawgz.
Catch the neck and hold her head, south paw.
Hell naw, can't fuck you raw.
Catch a nut and dip, like bitch my dick went soft.
Try'na get Karrueche head, and slide.
the wood like Juvie said.
Make a movie with the red, and dog her out like Gucci said.
Me and money newlywed, that's why that toolie in my pants.
Pull up with them uzi's and some goonies in a minivan.

I'mma dawg just like Gucci said.
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed.
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head.
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red.
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said.
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said.
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed.
I'm still a dawg, still dawg just like Gucci said.

My word is law, Is money my flaw.
I gotta have it if i'm broke, I go through withdrawal.
Round of applause, shout out her jaws.
Could suck a laffy taffy, right straight through a straw.
Faded like a Boosie cut, off gin and juice like Juicy cup.
Pull up in that Dooley truck, like Gucci smokin' fruity blunt.

Like we brought Snoop with us.
You a dog and I'm a dog, then nigga that make two of us.

I'mma dawg just like Gucci said.
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed.
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head.
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red.
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said.
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said.
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed.
I'm still a dawg, still dawg just like Gucci said.
