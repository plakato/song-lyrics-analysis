Too Soft Lyrics
by Wolfman D.

You're too soft.
I heard you get queasy watchin surgery.
The nerve of ye'.
Yeah, you been to jail, but just for purgery.
You can't even lift my rhyme book.
Cause them bars are abounding.
Leavin rappers speechless.
Cause my speeches are dumbfounding.

And I'm clownin' on these hounds.
That be softer than a teddy bear.
Call me claritin D.
So my rhymes stay pretty clear.
I'm hardcore.
Like a stale jawbreaker.
You're faker than a 8 dollar bill.
Printed on recycled paper.

I'm the flow god.
For you to be better is blasphemy.
And heracy, I'll blow you into bits.
Like I'm Master Chief.
Its been a while.
But these muscles never atrophy.
I'll whip all these kids into shape.
Call me master D.

You hatin' on it? Mad at me?
Stop it kid, you flatter me.
I break knees, shatter dreams.
Resort to teabagery.
Your Dairy Queen Haggary.
Ain't a damned match for me.
That ass is grass, you battle me.
I'll School you rat bastards, G.
\---------------------------------------------------------.
You're too soft.
You're like marshmallow fluff.
Stuffed with boiled cabage and.
Melted reeses cups.
You'll get eatten up.
By an old lady with no teeth or dentures.
You're softer than the walls.
In a mental health center.

Yall niggas must be crazy.
Thinkin' yall can faze me.
Devil's advocate suggests.
That yall just deaf, dumb, and lazy.
Thinkin you hard cause you roll.
With 9 or 10 of them.
And out here slingin rocks.
Like an angry palastinian.

Yall like,yo, I got racks.
Nah, you got packs of soot.
Cause your cream burnt holes in.
Your pocketbook.
Outhere actin bold and brash.
Writin checks with your mouth.
That I collect and have to cash at your ass.
With my foot.

Kidnap your candy ass.
And drown you in a brook.
Attackin every angle, corner.
Cranny and knook.
But I'm only throwin' jabs.

\------------------------------------------------------------.
You're too soft.
You're charmin mixed with cottonelle.
In a bathtub of backrubs, baby shit.
Rotten smellin.
Fresh cake, landolakes butter.
And a mandate that we should preach for peace in middle east.
For fellow man's sake.

Packin' pieces.
Claimed you're raised by the streets.
But get put in the heat.
And show you're bred by the yeast.
I'm not one to spray gats.
But to meley with tact.
Dont judge this book by the cover.
Til you read whats on its back.

Got stacks of fat knowledge.
Spewin cold hard facts.
Like i'm hailin out my mouth.
And you're caught in a trap.
Get locked on by the bull horns.
And you then get gored.
All you whores thinkin' I'm easy work.
Thats cheese on a board.

And you get snapped on.
Runnin' your yap knowing.
You're low hanging fruit for the weakest.
To snack on.
Step half correct to my scripts.
For a lyrical goring.
Cause my songs are like oil drills.
They're long and they're boring.
