Find a Way Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

You tell me your friends are distant.
You tell me your man's untrue.
You tell me that you've been walked on.
And how you feel abused.

So you stand here an angry young woman.
Taking all the pain to heart.
I hear you saying that you want to see changes.
But you don't know how to start.

Love will find a way.

Love will find a way.

I know it's hard to see.
The past and still believe.
Love is gonna find a way.
I know that love will find a way.

Love can make a way.

Leave behind the doubt.
Love's the only out.
Love will surely find a way.

I know this life is a strange thing.
I can't answer all the whys.
Tragedy always finds me.
Taken again by surprise.

I could stand here an angry young woman.
Taking all the pain to heart.
But I know that love can bring changes.
And so we've got to move on.

Love will find a way.

Love will find a way.

I know it's hard to see.
The past and still believe.
Love is gonna find a way.
I know that love will find a way.

Love can make a way.

Leave behind the doubt.
Love's the only out.
Love will surely find a way.

If our God His Son not sparing.
Came to rescue you.
Is there any circumstance.
That He can't see you through?

Love will find a way.

Love will find a way.

I know it's hard to see.
The past and still believe.
Love is gonna find a way.
I know that love will find a way.

Love can make a way.

Leave behind the doubt.
Love's the only out.
Love will surely find a way.
