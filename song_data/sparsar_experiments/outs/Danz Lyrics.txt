Danz Lyrics
by Swiss Lips.

DANZ.
We walk the walls, we move a mountain with our hands.
We kiss the air, we talk of moving to Japan, oh.
Give me something golden in my hands, hands.

DANZ.
We power up, we never stop until we're near.
The way we walk the stairs are falling on our feet, oh.
Give us something golden to believe in.

When I call, you gotta pick up the phone.
When I want, you gotta leave me alone.
When I run, you gotta run with me too.
When I kiss, you gotta kiss to be cool.

When I call, you gotta pick up the phone.
When I want, you gotta leave me alone.
When I fall, you gotta help me along.
When I die, you gotta cry for my soul.

DANZ.
We hit the rocks to power up and feel the heat.
We throw 'em up to give it up for love and fear, oh.
We can only feel it if it's near, near.

DANZ.
We walk the walls, we move a mountain with our hands.
Dream pop cassettes, we cause neglect our chosen plans, oh.
I can see 'em coming for us now, now.

When I call, you gotta pick up the phone.
When I want, you gotta leave me alone.
When I run, you gotta run with me too.
When I kiss, you gotta kiss to be cool.

When I call, you gotta pick up the phone.
When I want, you gotta leave me alone.
When I fall, you gotta help me along.
When I die, you gotta cry for my soul.

When I call, you gotta pick up the phone.
When I want, you gotta leave me alone.
When I run, you gotta run with me too.
When I kiss, you gotta kiss to be cool.

When I call, you gotta pick up the phone.
When I want, you gotta leave me alone.
When I fall, you gotta help me along.
When I die, you gotta cry for my soul.
