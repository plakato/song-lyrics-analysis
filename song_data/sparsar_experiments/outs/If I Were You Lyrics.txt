If I Were You Lyrics
by Vivid.

If I were you - I think I'd stay.
Just far enough to leave.
Before the ice might break.
If I were you - At least I'd wait.
Just close enough to get.
What others might take.
I'm moving across.
I'm moving too fast.
Sometimes I'm much too slow.
But how should I know?
I call to my past.
Then turning my head.
Present's what I got instead.
I'm talkin' too loud.
I whisper and moan.
Sometimes I'm used to speak.
Of nothing at all.
I'm holding me down.
And lift myself up.
Though I'm half way there I stop.
I'm wearing a frown.
I'm cracking a smile.
Sometimes I'm not so sure.
Whom I habit for.
I swim like a stone.
A swallow it all.
And sure I'm talking off o fall.
Here we are.
And we're all the same.
Watch the tride roll in.
And roll away again.
