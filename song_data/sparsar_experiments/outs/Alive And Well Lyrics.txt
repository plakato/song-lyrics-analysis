Alive And Well Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Headin down the wrong way.
On a one way street.
Lookin for love but it ain't.
Lookin for me.
I feel like a fool.
But what do you expect.
Life is to short to waste on regrets.

Look at me now it must be.
Hard to tell....

That I'm alive and well.
I'm alive and well.
And I'm here to tell.
That I'm alive and well.

Ten years later and it's all the same.
No reason to bitch but I still complain.
God only knows what God only knows.
How can we find the key to it all.

Lookin at me now it must be.
Hard to tell....

Look out !

Closer to the truth the.
Harder it seems.
Hell if I know what.
It's supposed to mean.
With all the struggle that we endure.
A little bit of faith could be the cure.

Every time you think it's all.
Going to hell... Remember....

I'm alive, you're alive.
We are alive and well.
And we here to tell.
That we're alive and well.
A little metal health.
Is still alive and well.

Get to the point, it won't take long.
A little bit of faith is gonna carry on.

The ride that we take is shorter.
Than it seems.
The good things in life don't have to stay dreams.
