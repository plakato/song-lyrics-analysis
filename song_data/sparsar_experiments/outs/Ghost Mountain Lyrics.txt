Ghost Mountain Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

When we climbed to the peak we planted a flag.
But the moment we had, I felt bad.
And then night came, so we got into our sleeping bags.
And then someone told a story about something dead and gory.

There was heat.
From the fire.
But I still froze when I saw the ghost.

I told the gang we weren't welcome.
The ghost made that clear.
So we stepped back, but it was drawing near.
And it lunged for our throats.
So we packed our things, made tracks.
Undid our footprints, even furled our flag, and....

We were gone! but what was on the top of the mountain.
The mountain top?

Sweet nothing! I made it up.
So we would make it down with no claim on Ghost Mountain.
