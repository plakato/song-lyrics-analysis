Consider It Mutual Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

Every time I look around my name is on your lips.
Every time I look around you're further away.
Every time I look around my name is on your lips.
Every time I look around you're fading away.

We taught you how to build an empire.
You showed us how to tear it down.
These past few years have changed my life.
I won't give up without a fight.

If it's true that I can be replaced.
Why is it that I cannot be erased?
I can see that you're letting go, letting go.
It's kinda funny that you'll never know, never know.
I am already gone.

You think you're justified.
You're tearing down my dream.
I think you're terrified.
You lost your way.

It's time you recognize somethings you can never fight.
Will you ever learn? When will you learn?
I'm making progress, I'm where I should be.
I'll use the rage that flows through me.

If it's true that I can be replaced.
Why is it that I cannot be erased?
I can see that you're letting go, letting go.
It's kinda funny that you'll never know, never know.
I am already gone.

I never ran away, it was more of an escape.
Bitterness will plague your nights always.
My story as told by you couldn't be more wrong.
Just wait for the headlines, it won't be long.

I kept your dirty secrets, your private life.
You hide from all those who hold you up high.
I don't need to hide behind a lie.
If friends are friends for never.
You were never a friend at all.

We all know you're getting old.
You should just let go.

You can't keep it going.
I promise you, you're coming down.

Look at me and see what you could have been.
Look at me and see what you could have been.
