Back to life - stan sb remix Lyrics
by 3OH!3.

There's a drama in my heartbeat, I know exactly where it's from.
That turn enough to street lambs, they say the day is almost done.
There's a... in my years now, I remember how it was.
The feeling we had last night and it won't stop now because.
Everybody says, hey no, we don't wanna see this day go.
If I ever had my say so.
We can make this go all night night night.
Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life.
Yeah, we can make it through the night.
If you listen to the words I say.
Cause if the party is dead.
All we need is candlelight, and a little bit of dynamite.
Everybody won't get out of our way.
I got a song stuck in my head.
I know exactly why it's there.
There's a noise outside my bedroom.
And I don't even care.
If I ever said go home.
Everybody here would say hell no.
All we gotta do is just let go.
We can make it through the night.
Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life.
Yeah, we can make it through the night.
If you listen to the words I say.
Cause if the party is dead.
All we need is candle light, and a little bit of dynamite.
Everybody won't get out of our way.
Oh oh oh oh....
We can bring it back to life.
Yeah, we can bring it back to life.
Cause I'll never get this promise out of my head.
And I'm never gonna get some sleep inside of my bed.
And I'm sorry if good night is something I've ever said....
Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life.
Yeah, we can make it through the night.
If you listen to the words I say.
Cause if the party is dead.
All we need is candlelight, and a little bit of dynamite.
Everybody won't get out of our way.
Oh oh oh oh....
We can bring it back to life.
Yeah, we can bring it back to life.
