Now I Can Breathe Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.


Walking inside of a dream.
Where love is highly esteemed.
Taking a chance with my heart.
Praying it travels far.
Then she says to me - why do you fear.
Why would you dream if you could not live.
Open your eyes see what is real.
I'll take it from there now breathe if you will.

You've ignited the flame in my life.
Now I can see again.
I celebrate that you are in my life.
Now I can breathe again.

Roses are smiling at me.
As if to say they share my glee.
Violets then sigh as they gaze.
As if they know that my day has been made.
There she goes again tear in her eye.
Whispering songs that make us cry.
She says three words that make me feel.
That I'm not in a dream and she's all so real.

Thinking of love you is fantasy.
Knowing I love you is destiny.
Finding that someone creates harmony.
Keeping the same is matrimony.
