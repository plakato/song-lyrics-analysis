Iron (Quintet Version) Lyrics
by Woodkid.

Deep in the ocean, dead and cast away.
Where innocence is burned, in flames.
A million miles from home, I'm walking ahead.
I'm frozen to the bone, I am....

A soldier on my own, I don't know the way.
I'm riding up the heights, of shame.
I'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest.
I'm ready for the fight, and fate.

The sound of iron shots' stuck in my head.
The thunder of the drums, dictates.
The rhythm of the falls, the number of dead.
The rising of the horns, ahead.

From the dawn of time to the end of days.
I will have to run, away.
I want to feel the pain and the bitter taste.
Of the blood on my lips, again.

The deadly burst of snow is burning my hands.
I'm frozen to the bone, I am.
A million miles from home, I'm walking away.
I can't recall your eyes, your face.
