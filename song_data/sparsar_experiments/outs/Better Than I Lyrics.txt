Better Than I Lyrics
by SWV.

She got my eyes she got my hair 
Go on and stare complexion to sing. 
It wouldn't be the same. If you knew she didn't care 
About you the way that I do now. 
So don't go thinkin' that she's better than I 
 
I'ma. Keep it one hundred 
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why 
She ain't got nothin' on my uh-ah 
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I 
 
I'm gon' shoot you 
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why 
Well I'm gon na shoot you, while I'm fin Up 
Fin up fin up fin up fin up to now, 
 
She doesn't cook. She doesn't clean 
Steam. You jeans. She doesn't rush 
Doesn't, take much to do to win your love 
You're, something in common. We share 
But, don't go thinkin' that she's better than I 
 
Boy. You got plenty to choose, 
Boy. Don'T forget 80-20 rules, 
So. Why she dance It? Don'T even matter 
 
Cause! I do my things better. 
 
I'ma keep it one hundred 
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why 
She ain't got nothin' on my uh-ah 
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I 
 
I'm gon' shoot you 
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why 
Well I'm gon na shoot you. While I'm fin up 
Fin up fin up fin up fin up to now 
 
Way, before you saw me walkin' down the aisle, you told me 
I'm the type of girl to stand out in a crowd. 
You said you liked my smile way before we said our vows 
I was your Tenderoni and you was my Bobby Brown 
 
Ba-ba-baby take a ride. You'Ve been playin' me a while 
Came in her too got us both like wow 
But, I'm fin to hit the dial. If you're still out on the prowl 
And, you can't commit to vows cause. You keep committin' violence, 
 
Boy! You got plenty to choose, 
Boy, don't forget 80-20 rules. 
So. Why she dance It? Don'T even matter 
 
Cause! I do my things better. 
 
I'ma! Keep it one hundred 
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why 
She ain't got nothin' on my uh-ah 
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I 
 
I'm gon' shoot you 
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why 
Well I'm gon na shoot you, while I'm fin Up 
Fin up fin up fin up fin up to now 
 
I'ma keep it one hundred 
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why 
 
She ain't got nothin' on my uh-ah 
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I 
 
I'm gon' shoot you 
She ain't got Nothin' that can prove why 
Well I'm gon na shoot you, while I'm fin up 
Fin up fin up fin up fin up to now
