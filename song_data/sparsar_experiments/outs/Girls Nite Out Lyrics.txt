Girls Nite Out Lyrics
by Tyler Collins.

I'm sick and tired of being left at home.
While the boys go out and leave us all alone, yeah.
I wanna go out with my girlfriends and party all nite.
And this time you won't change my mind.
Cause I've got my mind made up, so don't wait up for me.

It's that girls nite out, women nite out.
And there's nothing you can say, baby.
It's that girls nite to play, women nite to play.
So don't wait up for me.

You're stepping out, and we're leaving.
All that troubles behind, yeah, yeah, oh yeah.
I've got the girls, and we've only got one thing.
On our mind, where are we going tonite?

The time is right, so are you ready to party all nite?
And this time I'm leaving you behind.
Cause I've got my mind made up, so don't wait up for me.

It's that girls nite out, women nite out.
And there's nothing you can say, baby.
It's that girls nite to play, women nite to play.
So don't wait up for me.

I like to party, I'm outta here.
Which the time has come for the boys to realize.
That is our turn to have some fun and it's gonna be tonite.

It's that girls nite out, women nite out.
And there's nothing you can say, baby.
It's that girls nite to play, women nite to play.
So don't wait up for me.
