Won't you open up your senses Lyrics
by 4hero.

Open up your eyes, lookin' at the people.
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smilin'.
Open up your eyes, lookin' at the people.
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smilin', smilin'.
Wake in the mornin', look out of my window.
Down on the street as the people pass by.
Wonderful faces, awake but asleep.
Rushing around with appointments to keep.
Rushing around with appointments to keep.
Bald-headed banker, with bowler on head.
Credit for debit still in the red.
School girl in pigtails and freckly nose.
Tryin' to remember her Latin prose.
Tryin' to remember her Latin prose.
Open up your eyes, lookin' at the people.
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smilin'.
Open up your eyes, lookin' at the people.
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smilin', smilin'.
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes.
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes.
Isn't it surprisin' what you'll find?
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes.
What are they thinkin'? What's on their minds?
Are they all lookin' for somethin' to find?
Decreasin' circles, running around.
Searchin' for somethin' they've already found.
Searchin' for somethin' they've already found.
Open up your eyes, lookin' at the people.
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smilin'.
Open up your eyes, lookin' at the people.
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smilin'.
Open up your eyes, lookin' at the people.
