Orbit (feat. richard caddock) Lyrics
by WRLD.

Could be the sunset.
Or just the look in your eyes.
That shine so bright.
Reach out.
Over the ocean waves.
And try to come to life.

Don't let go over the bright blue sky.
Because the future's looking far to light.
I am ready for a long lost ship to set sail.
And carry me through the starry night.

Dream of me.
Whenever you are feeling oh so lonely.
Try to leave your fears behind.
We are locked.
In an Orbit racing round the docks.
Of moonlit worlds that may collide.
Keep your eyes on mine.

Touch down on the surface of my heart.
The feeling's never gone.
A brave adventurer like me.
Remembers everywhere that I've come from.

Keep your feet to the vacuum sky.
Cause it's surrounded us out here.
Follow the trail of the star dust.
Of the ones that came before us.
And we'll see what we've always been near.

Dream of me.
Whenever you are feeling oh so lonely.
Try to leave your fears behind.
We are locked.
In an Orbit racing round the docks.
Of moonlit worlds that may collide.
Keep your eyes on mine.
