The Hardest Part Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Pay my respect to the company store.
I ain't got no money don't want no more.
Pay my respects to the company boys.
Now just move along.
I worked hard for every little bit I got.
And got lucky once on some advice.
Met a dark haired girl that the Mississippi moon.
Musta left by mistake one night.
In a hurry, Lord.
And that ain't the hardest part.
The hardest part is loving.
Somebody that cares for you so much.

Promises don't pay cash at the bank.
If they did I'm bidding your word.
They couldn't pay me for the time that it took to write a check.
To buy a babydoll for my girl.
And I worked hard for every little bit I got.
The things I got are gonna stay.

And it's been flooding so hard on them company mines.
That you know it's gonna flood someday.
And you're gonna miss someone.
And that ain't the hardest part.
The hardest part is loving somebody that cares for you.
And that ain't the hardest part.
The hardest part is working and I've worked enough.
I could stretch that penny like a silver line.
Rolling through the pages of my life.
Underneath your name where it's underlined.
I've been turned around.
I've been mystified by a true love.
And that ain't the hardest part.
Talkin' bout a true love.
And that ain't the hardest part.
And that ain't the hardest part.
And that ain't the hardest part.
