Angelfuck - live at house of blues
by Volbeat.

Little angelfuck.
It's a shame your luck isn't better, babe.
Did you like the fun?
Did you like the times I promised you?

Open wounds on your breast.
Little angel is red.
She says nothing new anymore.

Little angelfuck.
I see you going down on a fireplug.
Little angelfuck.
Sighs for everyone.

Let those bastards believe.
Dry your thighs in relief.
She says nothing new anymore.

Little angelfuck.
I see you going down on a fireplug.
Oh, little angelfuck.
Sighs for everyone.

Let those bastards believe.
Dry your thighs in relief.
She says nothing new anymore.
