Under Pressure Lyrics
by Queen.


Mm mm ba de.
Mm mm da be.
Mm mm da beh beh.

Pressure pushing down on me.
Pressing down on you, no man ask for.

Freddie Mercury.
Under pressure that burns a building down.
Splits a family in two.

David Bowie.
Puts people on streets.

Um ba ba be.
Um ba ba be.
De day da.
Ee day da - that's okay.

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about.
Watching some good friends screaming.
Together 'Let me out'.

Freddie Mercury.
Pray tomorrow gets me higher.

David Bowie.
Pressure on people people on streets.

Day day de mm hm.
Da da da ba ba.
Okay.
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor.
These are the days it never rains but it pours.
Ee do ba be.
Ee da ba ba ba.
Um bo bo.
Be lap.

David Bowie People on streets.
Freddie Mercury ee da de da de.
David Bowie People on streets.
Freddie Mercury ee da de da de da de da.

David Bowie.
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about.
Watching some good friends screaming.
Together 'Let me out'.

Freddie Mercury.
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high.

David Bowie.
Pressure on people people on streets.

Together.
Turned away from it all like a blind man.
Sat on a fence but it don't work.

David Bowie.
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn.
Freddie Mercury.
Why - why - why?
David Bowie.
Love love love love love.
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking.

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love.
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

Because love's such an old fashioned word.
And love dares you to care for.
The people on the edge of the night.
And love dares you to change our way of.
Caring about ourselves.
This is our last dance.
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves under pressure.
Under pressure.
Pressure.
