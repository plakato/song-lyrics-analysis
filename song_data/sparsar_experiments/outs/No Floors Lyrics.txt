No Floors Lyrics
by Yung Kwon.

Barely rhymin' 
Call it a slant rhyme, 
Not makin' any sounds 
Call it. A mime. 
Period is almost over 
Runnin' out of time, 
Risin' to the top 
Not, really 
, 
Kwon killin' the track 
Spittin'. With my boi, the Incredible Mac 
Pullin' out the 9s 
And, the 37s' 
Fuck Wawa goin' to 7-11 
Gettin', some Doritos 
 
Bout to leave 
So Imma leave, 
If dis was fall, 
I would leave 
I can't breath 
Cause Imma leave
