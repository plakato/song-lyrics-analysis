A Night In The Forest Lyrics
by 666.

In the deep of lonely forests.
Where the life ends.
Far away from living beings.
Where the darkness touches me.
The song of evil souls is heard.
I feel the other world is close.
Where I belong.
During my damned wandering.
The end has already gleamed in front of me.
A voice bursts forth from the deep silence inside.
The Satan is calling me to follow him.
I do this with a cold heart.
As I arrived to the end of my road.
I step over the gate.
Which leads to the infinite.
Where my eyes may open.
And my hatred may fulfill itself.
