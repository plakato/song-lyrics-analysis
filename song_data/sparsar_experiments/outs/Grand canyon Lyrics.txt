Grand canyon Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album: Silver Haze.
Grand canyon.
If you believe to reach that high.
Won't you give me a ride.
So I can kiss the sky, goodbye.
I'm gonna show yu the way.
When standing at the crossroads.
If you are sure to reach that high.
Thou' I've been here.
A thousand times or more.
It's blinded me.
But now I see.
I'm taking ground.
Cause the mountain is lying down If you give way to yesterdays.
Turn back around.
There's only winding ways.
Cause yesterday's gone You have to try and find tomorrow.
If you give way to yesterdays.
I'm giving in cause high is low.
The planet's colliding in the ice and snow.
Why was I given wings.
I could have manage without.
I'm giving in cause high is low.
