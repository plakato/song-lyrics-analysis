Dance With Me Lyrics
by The sweet remains.

This old house Is cracked and worn.
Walls are faded and the curtains torn.
Sometimes it seems like we're runnin'.
Just to keep from fallin' behind.
But the day is done Darlin, won't you come.
Leave the dishes, turn the TV off.
I built a fire, and the fire is warm.

Don't know where but I hear the beat of drum.
And somewhere I swear I hear the strains of a song.
DANCE with ME To this Song.
Dance now darlin' let your hair run down.
DANCE with ME All night long.
Dance now darlin'  to this Song…

Come to me, darlin'.
Put your hand in mine.
Lay your head down on my shoulder.
Give me your lips sweet like wine.
Now if a kiss is just a kiss.
I don't know what to make of this.

And although the radio plays only a storm.
Still somewhere I hear the downbeat of a drum.
DANCE with ME To this Song.
Dance now darlin' let your cares be gone.
DANCE with ME All night long.
Dance now darlin'  to this Song…

SO LET THE LONG HAND RUN.
DON'T LET THE TIME WORRY US.
CAUSE WHEN YOUR IN MY ARMS.
I STILL HEAR THAT SAME SWEET SONG.

And I wanna Get lost…
And I wanna get lost...
And I wanna get lost In this song…

The Room's in a spin Kaleidoscope of light.
Feel just like I'm upside down.
But darlin please don't set me right.
Cause you got me lost in a feeling.
And I don't wanna wanna be found.

Don't know where but I hear the beat of drum.
And somewhere I swear I hear the strains of a song.
So, DANCE with ME To this Song.
Dance now darlin' let your hair run down.
DANCE with ME All night long.
Dance now darlin'.
To this Song… to this... Song.
