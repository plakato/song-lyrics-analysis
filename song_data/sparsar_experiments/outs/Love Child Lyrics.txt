Love Child Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Tenement slum.

You think that I don't feel love.

But what I feel for you is real love.
In others eyes.
I see reflected.

A hurt, scorned, rejected.

Love child.
Never meant to be.
Love child.
Born in poverty.
Love child.
Never meant to be.
Love child.
Take a look at me.

I started my life.
In an old, cold run down tenement slum.

My father left.
He never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew.
So afraid that others knew I had no name.

This love we're contemplating.

Is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating.

The child we maybe creating.

Love child.
Never meant to be.

Love child.

Society.

Love child.
Always second best.

Love child.

Different from the rest.

Mmm, baby.

Mmm, baby.

I started school.
In a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out.

I knew the way it felt.
To always live in doubt.
To be without the simple things.
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me.

Don't think that I don't need you.

Don't think I don't wanna please you.
But no child of mine will be bearing.

The name of shame I've been wearing.

Love child.
Love child.
Never quite as good.

Afraid.
Ashamed.
Misunderstood.

But I'll always love you.

I'll always love you, you, you.

I'll always love you.

I'll always love you, you, you.

I'll always love you.

I'll always love you, you, you.
