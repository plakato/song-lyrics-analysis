2112 - oracle
by Rush.

... I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly.
yet I see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the.
staircase ....
... I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure.
spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed.
by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way to life,.
a way that had been crushed by the Federation long ago. I saw now how.
meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ....
I wandered home though the silent streets.
And fell into a fitful sleep.
Escape to realms beyond the night.
Dream can't you show me the light?
I stand atop a spiral stair.
An oracle confronts me there.
He leads me on light years away.
Through astral nights, galactic days.
I see the works of gifted hands.
That grace this strange and wondrous land.
I see the hand of man arise.
With hungry mind and open eyes.
They left the planet long ago.
The elder race still learn and grow.
Their power grows with purpose strong.
To claim the home where they belong.
Home to tear the Temples down....
Home to change!
