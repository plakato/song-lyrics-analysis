My Melody Lyrics
by Queen Pen.


Uh, it's all for you, my melody boo.
This lovin' is all for you, break it down, how you feel about this.

Reminiscing to back in our beginning.
Sweet politicing in the heart of the village.
We slid digits on low, exchanged a couple of 'hellos'.
As you slid out the door.
I remember clearly makein' moves up the steps we made eye contact.
It was his gleam that brought me back, ligit.
How we met on some real ghetto star shit.
Mad chicks on my melody's dick.
See he got this kinda grace about himself.
Dealin' with fast life all flooded up with wealth.
So for him, cuties just be comin' like a dime a dozen.
Smooth talkin' brothers always get easy fuckin'.
But I ain't mad, at all of his cutie head lovin'.
And all his playin hard to get was worth tryin' to get my lovin.
He's got personality for days.
The kinda melody others bad talkin' many ways.
The kinda beat that always stays paid, my special kinda boo who always.
Appreciates gettin' laid.
My melody....

Just the way. I wanna be loved.
Yeah....

True, we been together from the very beginning.
Since blocks be turned into states, baguettes be turned into cakes.
So he be knowin' how I'm down by law.
Plus his knowledge himself be havin' his mentality bore.
He gets first bids when I'm blowin' in from tour.
His sex is respected behind closed doors.
Listen, he the bomb, I can't tell you different.
It's a fact how he mistify me like Kaiser Sosack.
Uh, it feels good to know how others wish they could be loved.
In the clubs bitches screwin' up their mugs because.
They envious to how my boo is true to this.
Gold diggin' bitches always be disputing shit.
That don't even concern them, I'm learnin'.
The next chick that try to make your melody a B-track.
But true, he be bigger than that.
My boo be realisin' that his wifey'll always have his back, uh.
...Check out my melody....

Cause you love me baby.....
Just the way I wanna be loved.
Yeah....

Communication be never a mess.
Coz he be keepin' street conflict away from this relationship.
He's got a mind of his own.
He's a leader, not scared to be a dreamer, my black man digger.
And I be down till the day that I die, loyalty bonafied.
So how ask why I, dedicated all my love to his cause.
Financially lock him down, hide his monies from the law 'coz.
No matter what my melody be's a good man.
No m,atter how he ran on the actions of his plan and.
I be down till the day that I die.
Loyalty bonafied, my melody and I... uh.

'Coz you love me baby.
Just the way I wanna be loved.
Yeah... It's so nice lyin' here in you arms.
Your personality has that charm.
'Coz you love me baby.
Just the way I wanna be loved.
Oooh I could stay here for the rest of my life.
I wanna be your lover, wanna maybe you wife.
'Coz you love me baby.
Just the way I wanna be loved.
Yeah... Yeah... You love me baby....
