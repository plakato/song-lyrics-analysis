Acetate Lyrics
by Volcano Choir.

I will hobble you around.
I may drive you down.
There are promises I'll make.
There are promises that I'll take away.

But I won't beg for you on acetate.
I won't crawl on you to validate.
Tear those numbers down, I won't be having them around.
For now.

You found me on the beach.
I was resting there for weeks.
I will never cauterize / I will never tow the lines.
I will never fortify.

It's shudders up under the covers.
I've tumbled up under fronters row.
Wonder if I've recovered now.

But I won't beg for you on acetate.
I won't crawl on you to validate.
Tear those numbers down, I won't be having them around.
For now.

Shout it, shout it golden loud.
The apple's on the archer's ground.
No longer feeling tepid now.
SHOUT IT say it louder now.

I wanna carry on ....
Tear those numbers down.
