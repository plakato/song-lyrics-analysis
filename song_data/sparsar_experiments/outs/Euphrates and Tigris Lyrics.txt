Euphrates and Tigris Lyrics
by The Zolas.

I bet she's rail-thin like a heron.
Over the phone she talks and I just listen in.
“we'll never meet until it's just too late for us.
You're the Euphrates and I'm the Tigris”.

Talk talk, the tang of exhaust.
The mystery's gone again.
I threw the light on you.
The way that I always can.
Conquest dredged the loch ness.
And the mystery's gone again.

She left her Braille open to my fingertips.
Her pockets weighed down because they're littered with.
Cigarette lighters from all the boys she's ever loved.
Despite them all she still can't stay warm enough.

Talk talk, the tang of exhaust.
The mystery's gone again.
I threw the light on you.
The way that I always can.
Zoom zoom, streetview the moon.
And the mystery's gone again.
