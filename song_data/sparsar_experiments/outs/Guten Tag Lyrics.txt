Guten Tag Lyrics
by +44.

My voice screaming through your mobile telephone.
My fist clenched tight against your status quo.
My teeth are brand new from Dr. Best and his son.
My soul for a little bit of resolution.

It was on sale at an offer an unbeatable price.
Trade in your wasted life for a newer device.
It had only begun and I already knew.
There's something wrong with this promise there's a problem for you.

I won't give in and I'm taking it back x4.

Guten Tag, Guten Tag, now I'm taking it back.
I can't give any more, so now I'm taking it back.
Guten Tag, I admit, I was impressed at the start.
But your life starts crushing when you take it too far.
Guten Tag.

My voice coming at you on a late night show.
My fists reigning blows down on your cheek bones.
My teeth biting at the heart of television.
My soul for a little bit of revolution.

It was on sale at an offer an unbeatable price.
Trade in your wasted life for a newer device.
It had only begun and I already knew.
There's something wrong with this promise there's a problem for you.

I won't give in and I'm taking it back x4.

Guten Tag, Guten Tag, now I'm taking it back.
I can't give any more, so now I'm taking it back.
Guten Tag, I admit, I was impressed at the start.
But your life starts crushing when you take it too far.
Guten Tag.

Mobile phone.
Doctor under the sun.
Unbeatable price.
Theres a problem for you.
On a late night show.
Television.
My soul for a little bit of revolution.

It was on sale at an offer an unbeatable price.
Trade in your wasted life for a newer device.
It had only begun and I already knew.
There's something wrong with this promise there's a problem for you.

I won't give in and I'm taking it back x4.

Guten Tag, Guten Tag, now I'm taking it back.
I can't give any more, so now I'm taking it back.
Guten Tag, I admit, I was impressed at the start.
But your life starts crushing when you take it too far.
Guten Tag.

Guten Tag.
