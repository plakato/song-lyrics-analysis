Hoochiemumma Lyrics
by Blood Duster.

I feel like your hoochie mumma.
Under the covers.
You taste so sweet, you like my meat - ah.
Stoke the fi - ah.
Face the facts you want me bad - ah.
Like your moth - ah.
Feel my girth and look in wonder.
I'm a fuck machine like no other.

The desire.
To try her.
Before you buy her.
Desire.
To try her.
Before You.

I feel like your hoochie mumma.
Under the covers.
You taste so sweet, you like my meat - ah.
Stoke the fi - ah.

The desire.
To try her.
Before you buy her.
The Desire.
To try her.
Before You... buy her.
The desire.
To try her.
Before you buy her.
