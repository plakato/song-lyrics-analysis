Crux Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Killing all your dreams.
I ain't playing with you bitches.
If you tryna start a fight then you will leave with 30 stitches.
I got ash in the whip.
Bitches on my dick.
Saying that you got it but I never seen that shit.
Fake boi, fake boi tryna get a little taste.
If you get a little closer you will get a little baked.
I been smoking all day.
Sippin' on faith.
Bitches they message but message erased.

No time for you bitches if you playing shit, playing shit.
Drugs up in my system I been saying it, saying it.
One main focus on my mind is staying lit, staying lit.
Music is my fucking life so I just stay up killin' it.

Bitches get to talkin' but I think they want my life.
They fuckin' want my dick but I don't need no one tonight.
Just lay me up to rest up in this grave so I can die.
The level of depression in my soul is just too high.
