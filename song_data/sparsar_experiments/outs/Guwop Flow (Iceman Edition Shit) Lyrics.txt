Iceman edition shit, baby, 
Huh 
Niggas already know how I'm rockin' nigga 
Six-O shit, baby, Six-O shit, baby,

Iceman, shit, bitch, I'm George Gervin 
Ridin' around and I'm servin' 
 
That nigga. You heard me

I'm drinkin' that dirty 
This, Glock holdin' thirty 
Bitch. I score like George Gervin 
, 
Ridin''round town. I got yo' bitch with me. 
Might sell you a couple zips of this hickory 

And, like some kids at dinner time. We be movin' P's, 
Feelin', really goofy off these Percys jeez 
Ruth's Chris shit, ain't, no Applebee's, 
Two cubans round my neck cost, a hundred G 
And nigga fuck. This rap shit, bitch, I'm known to squeeze 
600 shit. I spit a hundred ki's 
Pistols everywhere. We causin' murder scenes 
Might, take a selfie on some lightskin shit 
But every we club that we in we get them pipes in bitch, 
, 
Iceman shit. I don't give a fuck 
Ridin' around town with my .45. It ain't tucked 
Balmain Jeans me A nigga that zip'em up 
 
Breezo whatcha doin' Bitch, I'm coolin' and boolin' 
Hundred shots dress'em up suit'em and boot'em 
Crackhead hoe bitch you smokin' bags 
I got 2 for 25. What you wan na grab 
Hit a fuck nigga with a couple jabs 
I used to stand on the 9 with a hundred bags, 
Rich nigga shit Ballys on my ass 
A hundred racks in each pocket. I ain't trying to brag 
All my ex-bitches lookin' super sad 
Go. Tell your dusty ass nigga go and chase a bag 
I'm the best nigga bitch could've ever had 
I'm eating hundred dollar steaks. I can't fuck with strags 
If you sneak diss me nigga. That'S yo' ass 
Paparazzi shit, bitch, I'm known to flash 
Rappin' ass nigga wan na act like he Biggie 
Inflate yo' fat ass. With this hundred round semi bitch 
 
Iceman shit bitch. I don't give a fuck 
Chiraq to PA to New York. My guns, tucked 
Lift. This motherfucker I'll fire, this bitch up 
 
This that Six-O shit, nigga
