All Right You Guys Lyrics
by The Runaways.


Hey you.
The air is really thick tonite.
Hey you.
You wanna join your friends outside.
We don't care what we do is right as long as we do it.
We don't care if what we do is right cause we do it all night.

Alright.
All right you guys.
All right.
All right you guys.

Hey you.
The city's at our command.
Hey you.
Gonna rock it like nobody can.
We don't care if what we do is right as long as we do it.
We don't care if what we do is right cause we do it all night.

Alright.
All right you guys.
All right.
All right you guys.
