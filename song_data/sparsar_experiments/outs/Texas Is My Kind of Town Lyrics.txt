Texas Is My Kind of Town Lyrics
by Rushlow.

That Austin City Limits sign is callin' me in.
Headed down to Sixth Street to hear some great unknown again.
It just feels good to have my boots on sacred ground.
Yeah, Texas is my kind of town, yeah, Texas is my kind of town, oh.

Don't need to be in Mexico, sittin' in the sand.
I'll be in Mi Tierra's with a margarita in my hand.
There's plenty of Spanish dancers there to go around.
Yeah, Texas is my kind of town.

When I need to roam.
Spread my wings and just let go.
I just roll my own wheels down the road.
Through my kind of town, yeah.

Well, there's cowboys and hippies everywhere you go.
Some guy named Billy Bob gave me my first show.
I heard a DJ named Cactus, yeah, he's diggin' my sound.
Oh, Texas is my kind of town.

When I need to roam.
Spread my wings and just let go.
I just roll my own wheels down the road.
Through my kind of town, yeah.

There's somethin' in the water, yeah there's somethin' in the wine.
There's somethin' in the spirit here that stands the test of time.
Need I mention the women cause they make us all so proud.
Yeah, Texas is my kind of town, yeah, Texas is my kind of town.

My kind of town, ooh yeah, yeah, it's my kind of town.
Yeah, Texas is, Texas is my kind of town.
Texas is, Texas is my kind of town, Texas is.
Texas is my kind of town, that's right, yeah.
