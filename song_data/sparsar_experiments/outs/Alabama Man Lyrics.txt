Alabama Man Lyrics
by Sweet.

3 down, 2 up.
He's gonna take a shot.
Alabama green base.
The dice is his vice.
He throws those dice, to save his life.
He's spinning around, with the wheel.....

Alabama fever, yeah.
He's gone too far.
That mississippi man.
He wants to be a star.
But the New York hustler,huh.
He's got his eye on him.
With his fingers in his pocket.
Of that satin vest,yeah.
He'll bring him down.

To see his shot.
To call his bluff.
Yeah just to put him down.
When the aces are around.

Hey mister, you got a spare place here?
Well,I'm just passin' through.
And I need to waste some time.
On my way down the line, yeah.

Alabama fever.
He's gone too far,huh.
Ok Buddy, you can pull up a chair.
But the New York hustler.
Oh, he wasn't aware.
Of the rules of the game,huh.
He'll high roll no more.
He reached too far.
Into the pocket of that satin vest.
Goodbye Alabama, hello Skid Row.
He's going back.

Skid Row I'm coming; I got.
I went too far.
I'm coming back.
