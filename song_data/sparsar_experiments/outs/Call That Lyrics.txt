Call That Lyrics
by Wonder Broz.


Bad girls, pay attention.
Even good girls with bad intentions.
This especially goes out to my grown women.
Who life routine cause the fun missing.
Lemme answer y'all service, proven success aw yeah and it's worth it.

You know it's right when you feel a lil nervous.
Butterflies in the stomach mean that it's working.
It may not be meant to be.
But this red bull is the monster with the energy.
The newer, the better.
The younger, the fresher.
The excitement gonna' have you writing love letters like.
Dear baby I miss you, can't wait to see you and kiss you.
You and I, the perfect match.
Once you down with G ain't no turning back right ?

I think your man need to fall back.
When you pop that I'm all off track.
Like I ain't neva' saw that.
All that, tell me what they call that.
Tell me what they call that.
I just want to know what they call that.
Girl tell me what they call that.
I just want to know what they call that.

Andale! Andale! Mami E, I, E, I, Oh Oh.
You poppin' tonight, all you need is some me in your life.
I'm young and fun and I could treat you right.
It's your life, you deserve it.
I'm far from retiring, your boy be working.
I do it with a smile, my engine run good girl it got low miles.
Tool, I'm still that dude.
Day going bad, lemme switch that mood.
Day going great cause of you know who.
Don't short change yourself, you can have that boo.
Live life, don't worry.
Forget them haters girl, this your story.
Now, just gone gone get it, and let your boy know if you with it.
