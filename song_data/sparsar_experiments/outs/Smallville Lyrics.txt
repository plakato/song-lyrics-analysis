Smallville Lyrics
by Yung Illie.

This Song is dedicated to Jordan Greer, Chris Smith, Prince Woods, BRich and.
the falling soldiers we lost this past year God Bless.

When I'm Looking Down.
Looking Down at you When I'm.
Looking Down.

When I'm Looking Down.
Looking Down At You.
When I'm Looking Down sooo ohhh.
When I'm Looking Down... Looking Down at you.
When I'm Looking Down sooo ohhh.
When I'm Looking Down.
When I'm Looking....
When I'm Looking....
When I'm Looking Down....

Want you to know I apologize.
For not coming to Nick funeral.
I heard some people would.
Question whether we knew each other.
I swear they act like me and nick.
Did Not grow up as brothers Damn!
That really hurt my pride.
I was dead inside.
Should've seen them tears.
Come down my eyes.
When I got the news that big.
Homie Died still can't not.
Believe It now I'm in the booth.
And you can hear my vocals bleeding.
Forever I am grieving really I'm asking didn't want my Last image to be of him.
In a casket I just want to picture.
My friend laughing didn't want my last image of him In a casket man.
They don't understand.

Looking Down At You.
Looking Down At....
Your the only one.
Your the only one.
Your the only one looking up.
Your the only one.
Your the only one.
Your the only one looking up.
Your the only one.
Your the only one.
Your the only one looking up.
Your the only one.
Your the only one.
Your the only one looking up.

All my Angels looking down.
As I'm looking up.
Told em I'm too good.
Just to fun this up.
I believe theirs one God.
One love I believe if we all fly.
Then we all doves a million No's.
Till I get to one yes uh.
A Million flows till they crown me the best.
All my Angels looking down.
From above God's Nest.
God be my best as I walk thru.
The Valley of the shadow of death.
Protect yo neck like its Wu-Tang Set.
Mississippi Forever you know I rep till my death until my spirit is gone the.
music is all that is left,left,left,left,left,left.
