Bravest Everything Lyrics
by Yuna.


Lovely, that's what you are to me.
I love you when you're strong.
I love you when you're weak.

Lovely â€“ you shine so bright.
I love you when you're wrong.
I love you when you're right.

Sometimes they try to break you.
But just be good to your heart.
Sometimes they try to change you.
Don't let them tear you apart.

Run, running far away.
I'll be here.
And I got your back.

When you are out there.
Doing what you do best.
You are my greatest everything.
When you are out there.
Doing what you do best.
You are my bravest everything.

And when I'm down.
Keep on lifting me.
Keep on lifting me up.

Lovely, the world can be frightening.
You feel a little scared.
But you will get through it.

Lovely, things can go wrong sometimes.
Feel like you can't go on.
Well, better things will come.

Run, run and don't look back.
Have no fear.
And I'll meet you there.
