Hannibal Lyrics
by Unorthodocks.

Unorthodocks.
Ravenous caged animal, naturally savage mammal will.
Damage glands and enamel for an inanimate tangible.
Granted he ain't a fan of bull, ride the elephant; Hannibal.
Hatching a hundred plans while your clan would clamor for Danimals.
Look man, understand that I'm just mechanical.
With uncanny mechanics so have a xanny and panic.
Or any anti-D manics, tell and Annie and Danny daddy has been bad he won't be.
back....
Had to let it go just so I could bring it back.
I know we ain't got bling or plaques but if you know it, sing the tracks.
You ain't gotta trip if you can't hit the high notes.
Just jive with the live guys that ride live coyotes.
That's that west side baby, catch me on the Indi Rez.
Hottest rapper in the valley, just look up what Syndee says.
Hit up Fashion late night and try to find a trendy lez.
We could roll different flavors but miss me with that spendiness.
Unless you bring your friend in that suspender dress.
Heard she's sentimental we'll show her some gentle tenderness.
Spark the mental ember then bag her quick as a ten of ses.
With with more than one ten I see, man I can see why these men are stressed.
But then again I been a mess with the pen and pad.
Shit had cost me almost every single friend I had.
So take an interest or take it in the chest.
Sucker I been a great, I'll incinerate of up you second guess.
Life is a game of chess and these suckers succumb to second best.
Some of these sorry showmen are overgrown in diplomacy.
I'm arrogant, godliness is obvious when you notice me.
Fiending like Jodeci just to flow to a Flying Lotus beat.
Motor boat flows like a fo'fo' rotary.
Slowly crash your row boat on some yo-ho-ho it's me.
Gold flows got me up in your old hoe's ovaries.
Posting Go-Pro vids, hoping promoters notice me.
Ripping hosiery, calling out all the posery.
I impose my will on the unskilled that's opposing me.
