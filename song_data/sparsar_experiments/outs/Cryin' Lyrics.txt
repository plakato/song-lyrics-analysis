Cryin' Lyrics
by Vixen.

One look and I saw what I wanted to see.
You know that you wrapped my heart around your finger so easily, yeah.
With your centerfold body going through the moves.
Why did I keep wasting the truth for you, tonight.

I won't be cryin', cryin'.
When I think about you, 'cos I opened my eyes.
And I won't be cryin', cryin', 'cos those days are gone, gone.

Someone twisted you, so you gave it to me, yeah you gave it to me good.
You're a nightmare everywhere, disguised as a dream.
Well I got lost, wandering through the darkness in your maze of lies.
Your trapdoor-way right into my insides, but tonight.

I won't be cryin', cryin'.
When I think about you, 'cos I opened my eyes.
And I won't be cryin', cryin'.

The tears have fallen to the floor.
But you won't catch me cryin' anymore.

I won't be cryin', cryin'.
When I think about you, 'cos I opened my eyes.
And I won't be cryin', cryin', those days are gone, gone.
Cryin', cryin'.
When I think about you, 'cos I opened my eyes.
And I won't be cryin' , cryin', those days are gone, gone.
Cryin', cryin'.
When I think about you , 'cos I opened my eyes.
And I won't be cryin' , cryin', those days are gone, gone.
Cryin'.
