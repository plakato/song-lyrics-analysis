RAW SHITT (PROD. ONRA) Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.

Pretty colors here.
Pretty colors there.
Pretty colors everywhere.
But i'm down.
Stairs.
Where's.
My lighter.
Shawtys a fighter.
Thank god not a fuckin biter.
Bitch this mighta.
Hurt.
Gurth.
Broken angels.
Cold shoulders.
Crack boulders.
Joint rollers.
Crowd controllers.
I stole ya.
Moms.
Putcha arms behind ya back.
Dont think dont act.
Back a the car.
Feelin like a star.
My picture.
Infronta horizontal bars.
Far.
From home.
Hear my drone on and on.
Make ya girl moan.
Eat my grill bone.
Fuckin kickin stones.
Writin these top a tha dome.
Buffed out new chrome.
Polish.
Demolished.
Too many bong hits.
Gong hits.
Bang tits.
Poon tang.
Full tang.
Blade.
Only barely legal age.
Turn the fuckin page.
Runnin outta ways to say.
I wanna run away.
And be alone.
But not lonely.
Fucks goin on wit me homie.
I unno G.
You fuckin crazy.
Naw i ain't lady.
You just fuckin scayzy.
Stay away from me.
Needa smoke some tree.
Live in harmony.
Wash off the blood &amp; pee.
Still livin free.
Prosperity.
Only takin carea me.
So why care to see.
What i'm gonna be.
