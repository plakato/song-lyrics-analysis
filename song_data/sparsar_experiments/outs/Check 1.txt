Check 1 2 
 
Call me S-Y, mind right: music/ 
I'm that dude man cool as a blue fan/, 
Check, 1 2 
 
I've, been slept on too long/ 
Like your cheeks. With the sheet marks in it/ 
Cape off feeling I could be Clark. Kent, if/, 
Nobody notice. Didn'T have a vision now, I'm Lasik focused/ 
Third eye closing flow, wet soaking/ 
Crowd in control. Like I hit ‘em with a potion/ 
Spitting with a venom. That'S potent/, 
Doors of the church is open. It'S devotion/ 
Our, father Sergeant, Slaughter/ 
Jake, the Snake Roberts hate, the fake prophets/ 
Easy bake pockets. That mean I get cake/ 
Dick. Let me dictate how much she can dick take/ 
I switch gears. Never did breaks, move forward/ 
Try to live great die better who for it/ 
All against it, get crushed in the process/ 
Coupes like girls gone wild. All topless 
 
 Got ta stop one day, but not right. Now/ 
Don't ask me, who I think is hot right: now/ 
Cuz! If I see him, probably getting shot right, now/ 
Erase his name from the top. I want his spot right. Now/ 
Raise your cups in the air like the Blackhawks/ 
All, these niggas fronting like someone ripped they back, off/ 
It's. All good, though I keep it 100/ 
Like an ‘A' in gym class nigga. We, the ones who run it/ 
S-y-cosis power of suggestion/, 
Give, ‘em lethal doses. All an injection/ 
Land mine, rhymes too explosive/ 
Needle for a pen, don't get poked, bitch/ 
Cuz. I ain't playing not the least homie/ 
Get, a wooden bed box. If you sleep on me/ 
And watch your mouth. If you speak on me/ 
Talking to the young God so preach on me, 
 
I brought it back for the people/ 
Real Rap part. Two starring in the sequel/ 
My headphones is on fire Siegal Jada/ 
Haters all around, but I keep cool/ 
Like, I'm laced in nitrous oxide/ 
Chilling in the cut real clean, like peroxide/ 
Can't touch me like hammer I'mma nail, you 
Hard to act hard when your heart start To fail you/ 
What, can I tell you just a shorty from the Chi/ 
Been playing with the pen before Live ‘95/ 
I had a Dreamcast music made my dreams, last/ 
Pops locked up, somehow it never seemed bad/ 
Still get it in today, though/ 
Catch me in the Streets or online like Halo/ 
Just, thank God for the day/ 
And I'mma, keep pushing like a baby on the way
