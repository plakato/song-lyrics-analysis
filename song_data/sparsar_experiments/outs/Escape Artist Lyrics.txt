Escape Artist Lyrics
by The Zolas.

My alter-ego. He's an escape artist.
He's only truly happy when he's under arrest.
Oh how he handsome, scheduled to hang to death.
He's only truly happy at the precipice.

He's like a mirror. He sticks into our ears.
A stethoscope to the chest of the vacant years.
I can't escape the chair, I'm etherized with fear.
That my only talent is in hanging here.

But then it's.
Hey boy, I've got your man he's right here.
Putty in my hands.
Ice cream and sweets.
Coming in the sheets.
He got no excuse to leave.

And in the real world, an intertidal cave.
I ride a desk chair waiting for a tidal wave.
I feel like dancing, but that is miles away.
I'm feeling hard and hollow like paper mache.

My alter ego. He's in a jailer's cage.
He sits and waits for the devil to abet his escape.
I'm sorry pastor, I can't be pasteurized.
All of the bibles in the world for a metal file.

At every clock strike, he hears the jailer's keys.
And the doubt starts to sprout til he's on his knees.
But he is singing, when the night is black.
“All I am is whatever I'm aiming at”.
And he remembers like it's his mother's call.
To feel his hand find a grip at the top of the wall.
And.
I want to feel it, I want to feel the fire.
Of the leftover sun on the roofing tiles.
