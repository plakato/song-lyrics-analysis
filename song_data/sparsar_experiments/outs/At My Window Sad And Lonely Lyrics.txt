At My Window Sad And Lonely Lyrics
by Woody Guthrie.

At my window sad &amp; lonely.
Oftimes do I think of thee.
Sad and lonely and I wonder.
Do you ever think of me?

Every day is sad and lonely.
Every day is sad and blue.
Do you think of me my darling?
As you sail that ocean blue?

At my window sad and lonely.
Stand and look across the sea.
And I sad and lonely wonder.
Do you ever think of me?

Will you find another sweetheart.
In some far and distant land?
Sad and lonely now I wonder.
If our boat will ever land.

Ships may ply the stormy ocean.
Planes may fly the stormy sky.
Sad and lonely but remember.
I will love you till I die.
