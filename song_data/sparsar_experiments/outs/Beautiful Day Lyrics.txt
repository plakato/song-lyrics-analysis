Beautiful Day Lyrics
by U-N-I.

3X 
Just a Beautiful Day, 
It feels so good, 
 
Just pump it up and just vibe 
 
Radiant like LA Sunshine. So let's crack the hen, no coke in mind. 
Live. For today, ain't promised life 
Roll with the Windows down bring the night 
As. The sun sets and the morning breaks 
Just. Thank God. You was able to wake 
Give a kiss to your girl, A kiss to your mom 
A dap, for my niggas that have to bare arms on a ... 
Beautiful Day. Keep it neutral, 
Let's all try to be beautiful people 
Respect life. Your life is respected. 
Turn this tune up, don't dare reject it 
Don't front. I know I got ya open, 
Check the dialect from the diaphragm, My Man, 
 
Put, your Glasses up. You can roll
it up, 
You can drink to this. You can smoke to this. 
You. Can roll to this put your windows down 
And pump the sound through any hood. 
3X 
It feels good 
Just a Beautiful Day, 
 
Just pump it up and just vibe 
 
I take sips of the OJ Scramble the eggs 
Put some butter on my 3 pancakes like the fingers. When I'm done 
Take a look outside. I see the sun just begun. 
So I hops in the shower: I'm lyin if I said 15 cause it takes about an hour 
And. I see it's 75 degrees. 
There'S no need for me to rock the long sleeves 
I'm hot, I'm I'm Cold 
I'm Cool, I'm Hot 
I see the trees, the kids, the block 
Beautiful little neighbor, gave a sexy, nod, 
One cup of this Kool-Aid to set the day right, 
So, I'm off to the Sunshine never wastes days like this 
Take advantage of the one life 
Keep your faith to the sky, 
That's, where the Heaven is 
That's, where the dream is well ain't, it
