Ain't No Way Around It Lyrics
by Wordplay.


Ay look my swag so mean I go to therapy for that. Thang 
I get high as a plane, while y'all niggas ride the train. 
This Hispanic bitch is bad nigga. She beyond profane 
Lil' mama and her friends. Some chicken heads Raising Canes 
Turned all up in the stars, imma codeine, astronaut, 
Imma killer all-star. Like my nigga Juggernaut 
If, I am out here tryna function, then I'm gon need some pot 
All. These bitches on me. So call me, Sir Fucks-A-Lot 
A player gon be a player, no matter how you say it. 
So, if Word Play, wants a bitch, then Word Play is gon pay for it 
Meets my criteria. If she can twerk and work that pole 
In my red Adidas, I'm in steal your bitch mode, 
 
Imma do whatever I want. So my name is Charlie Sheen, 
Imma boss, like Meek Mill or a college dean 
Put Saint Louis back on the map check them. Damn books, 
If, you bring your girl to the club she gon get took 
Hall of fame. Swag is what I got, and what y'all lack 
And my crew running train on all these hoes, like Amtrak 
In. My room got racks on racks, on racks, on packs, on packs on stacks 
Smoke. That weed get the munchies then buy some Lil' Debbie snacks 
Niggas brought that kushie. Now we about to take flight 
We somewhere in the heavens, while you're fucking around with a kite 
Fuck. What a hater say imma do me: 
Imma real muthafucking nigga ain't no way around it cause a
