Keep The Faith Lyrics
by Xperience.

Mother mother tell your children.
That their time has just begone.
I have suffered for my anger.
There are wars that can?t be won.
Father father please believe me.
I am laying down my guns.
I am broken like an arrow.
Forgive me.
Forgive your wayward son.
Everybody needs somebody to love.
Everybody needs somebody to hate.
Everybody?s bitching ?cause they can?t get enough.
And it?s hard to hold on.
When there?s no one to lean on.
Faith: You know you?re gonna live thru the rain.
Lord you got to keep the faith.
Faith: don?t let your love turn to hate.
Right now we got to.
Keep the faith keep the faith keep the faith.
Lord we got to keep the faith.
