WWF Lyrics
by QMC.

Drugs for the low got your love on the pole
Them Guns, gon na come them slugs gon na blow
Run, in your home, with a gun to your dome
Cause, we're Young and we're dumb, give a fuck where to go
Rap unstable The Black Kurt angle
Breakin, your ankles and breakin. Your tables
Give too fucks, if they scream you suck
Give, no, they kids, two blunts and they bitch two nuts
Light skin Kane spotlights get drained
Stop lifes with flames. Every time I'm in rang
Comin down like a hardy, I ain't gon na, be restrained
Young HBK, sweet music to your brain
In. This shit, like the game Triple H, be the name
Leave. You knocked out cold, like H in your vains
95 DX bitches flashin. They breast
Leave you like the undertaker in a casket to rest
