Living In A Magazine Lyrics
by Zoot Woman.

Advertise to lonely eyes.
Living in a magazine.
And no disguise your wear can hide.
Living in a magazine.

Face to love.
Style to foreign minds.
Names to buy.
Fashion your life.
Caught in the middle.
With you next to me.
The image is real.
Selling a lie.

Advertise to lonely eyes.
Living in a magzine.
And no disguise your wear can hide.
Living in a magazine.

Find yourself.
Between the lines.
Understand.
The change in you.
Keep a smile.
With fame in your eye.
Paper faces.
For a paper girl.

Advertise to lonely eyes.
Living in a magazine.
And no disguise your wear can hide.
Living in a magazine.
