Relentless Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

I want to change the world, so scared to change myself.
Old World. Old Tricks.
Why can't you speak cobblestone and bricks?
A tall tale told from within jail.
Gold, lust, crooked politics.
Virtue and Vice.
Men and mice.
We sail to the edge to find paradise.
But this world can't be flat.
I feel it.
It's spinning out of control.

Born and raised in a special place.

Sit still, breathe in the Pacific's grace.
It's home, my prison, and my escape.
Born and raised in a special place.
It's my home, prison, my escape.

I want to change the world.
So scared to change myself.
So scared to change myself.
I ask for strength.
Instead getting struggle every day.
I set my sights in to the sky then realize it's falling on all of us.

Too young to realize some things just can't be done.
Relentless, do it anyway.
Fly high straight at the sun.
That shadow of death took her father, his friend, and I can see that it wants.
me.
It will have to catch up.
I'll die chasing after my dreams.

The old gentleman was a student to the very end.
Chased every thought in every book on every shelf in all the world.
He saw it all.
War and peace, wealth and need, love and loss, pride and death.
And I'll never forget what this wise man told me.
“The most brutal teacher of all is experience, you'll see.
But in return, you learn, my God do you learn”.

I want you to see you are rich poetry.
An artist's favorite, unique, messy masterpiece.
Magnificent songs in a genius symphony.
So play your role in this whole story.

Too young to realize some things just can't be done.
Relentless, do it anyway.
Fly high straight at the sun.
That shadow of death took her father, his friend, and I can see that it wants.
me.
It will have to catch up.
I'll die chasing after my dreams.
