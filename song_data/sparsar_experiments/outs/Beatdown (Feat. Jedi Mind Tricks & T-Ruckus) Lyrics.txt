Beatdown (Feat. Jedi Mind Tricks & T-Ruckus) Lyrics
by Virtuoso.

Virtuoso 
Yo, I be attestin' bad. You soon discover I'm the best around 
Virtuoso omnipotent medulla rule the extra crowds 
Step in battles. Weapon-Rals, give ya chest a pound, 
'til ya. Breast is ground meat, 
Pharaohs Army, sound fleet, 
Snatch, ahold of half ya soul, make casserole 
Crack a pole on ya back and roll you in the blackest hole. 
The winter brewed enter nude, Amazonian jungle, warfare, 
Silver back guerilla, I'm covered in more hair 
Than four chairs. In a barber shop 
Vocals hard as rocks and the beat's on smash, 
Make ya veto, jigga, weak foe, 
Cause, my machete unique flow fuckin' beat yo ass 
I got the key to sense or hear a deer sharp as fox 
Sound as when carver chop galaxies and stars'll Drop 
You know Virt run with ogres who throw dirt 
Stomp ya, ass'til ya: bones squirt like yogurt 
T-Ruckus, 
Aiyyo rush, extreme pervert, I'm undercover covert, 
You need to put in work and get ya games out my face 
Let the flames in the place you fuckin' wid Ruck's, A fatal move 
You stand in disgrace: yo my brain's in outerspace 
Taste, the toxic improved reflexes like shadowboxin' 
Sternum, crack extreme force applied to ya back 
Pick ya, torture. That'S the rack, 
I'll scortch ya, with the lift 
And word style. I clash like with full clips 
Guerilla war. I killed ya core 
Atilla. The Hun don't want none 
I rap shit into the floors, 
Spittin' shots through ya door and kick that bitch down 
From the bowel, where Ruck throws the mic to the ground, 
In discussin' Ruck. You trust word to us: 
You spittin', the shit we flush time to bust 
And crack the earth's crust with one thrust 
Nasty as shit toxic. The hazardous analyst 
 
I got it locked from the 2-1 pound to
