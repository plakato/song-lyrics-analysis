I'll Believe in Anything Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Give me your eyes.
I need sunshine.
Give me your eyes.
I need sunshine.
Your blood.
Your bones.
Your voice.
And your ghost.

We've both been very brave.
Walk around with both legs.
Fight the scary day.
We both pull the tricks out of our sleeves.

But I'll believe in anything.
And you'll believe in anything.
I said I'll believe in anything.
And you'll believe in anything.

If I could get the fire out from the wire.
I'd share a life and you'd share a life.
If I could take the fire out from the wire.
I'd share a life and you'd share a life.
If I could take the fire out from the water.
I'd take you where nobody knows you.
And nobody gives a damn.
I said nobody knows you.
And nobody gives a damn.

And I could take another hit for you.
And I could take away your trips from you.
And I could take away the salt from your eyes.
And take away the spitting salt in you.
And I could give you my apologies.
By handing over my neologies.
And I could take away the shaking knees.
And I could give you all the olive trees.
Oh look at the trees and look at my face.
And look at a place far away from here.

So give me your eyes.
I need sunshine.
Give me your eyes.
I need sunshine.
Your blood.
Your bones.
Your voice.
And your ghost.

We've both been very brave.
Walk around with both legs.
Fight the scary day.
We both pull the tricks out of our sleeves.
But I'll believe in anything.
And you'll believe in anything.

If I could take the fire out from the wire.
I'd share a life and you'd share a life.
If I could take the fire out from the wire.
I'd share a life and you'd share a life.
If I could take the fire out from the wire.
I'd take you where nobody knows you.
And nobody gives a damn.
I said nobody knows you.
And nobody gives a damn.

I said nobody knows you.
And nobody gives a damn either way.
About your blood.
Your bones.
Your voice.
And ghost.
Because nobody knows you.
And nobody gives a damn either way.
And now I'll believe in anything and you'll believe in anything.
Because nobody knows you.
And nobody gives a damn either way.
