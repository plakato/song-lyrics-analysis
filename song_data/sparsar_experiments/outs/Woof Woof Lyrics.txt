Woof Woof Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.

Better ride 
You in tune to the sounds 
Of the dance floor giants 69. 
And we come to make you dance 
And. I brought my dogs wit me 
Check it out. 
 
Hold up, wait a minute, 
Y'all dance who think I'm pretty 
Loud man breakin' your town, 
We're. The force to make ya get down 
Know and a bigger mess in your plans. 
It beats nothing so I dance 
69 mic on the ground, breakin' it down 
Wantin', more time, 
But this time. It'S for my dogs, 
South North all y'all 
There's, more little things in life to get 
What about the one's in your 
Those that don't like huh 
Cuz me and my dogs are rightin' to get cool in it 
Then I cut and chit chat y'all where ya at Where ya, at

Where ya, at Where ya at 
Woof, woof

Woof, woof,

This for the dogs in the lounge 
And, all the dogs in the grill 
Can't be Forgettin', the dogs in our town 
That be keepin'. It real 
And. All the dogs that we've known 
They bark is worse than their bite 
This for the dogs to get 
Here's one that I love 
Say yo. Ladies 
Whassup, I know y'all'bout to give up 
Light the 36 and tear the club up. 
If ya wit me dance, a lil' bit 
I know y'all lad' come to chill 
Specially if y'all up on the bill, 
From the old up from A town, 
Cuz y'all like it cheaper right now, 
AKA as I get on my roll 
Work. That body down to the floor, 
Y'all just ain't afraid to vibrate 
Shake it up'till it breaks 
And if ya get bump, come see the father, 
Little girl. You know that I gotcha 
And. I want ya like that 
But for now, where ya, at Where ya, at 
Where ya at girls, 
 
This, is for my dogs in Dakota 
And, all my dogs in LA 
Can't forget my dogs in New Orleans 
Let's ride and ride it all day, 
Hands down shake Up we all up in the mix 
And it's about time. We all break it down 
And. It goes a little something like this 
 
Yo dog. You see a little something you like 
You, say here: kittie kittie, here, kittie kittie, kittie 
And. She lookin' all good in the club tonight. 
You say here: kittie kittie here, kittie kittie, kittie, 
If, you's a dog and you need a fix. 
Here kittie kittie here, kittie kittie kittie 
 
We've been trying to tell y'all for years 
That. You need to open your ears. 
Take, a trip down to the dirty south 
And find out what is woof woof about

No time for hype, beats and huh 
Cris-cross it all to make ya join 
Wit. The way that I bump bump bump 
Ladies down from state to state 
Cuz, like y'all dogs, we operate 
And when the bass of his glip 
Well ya must be in tune to hear what we hear. 
Just like ya, ought to do 
But inside of you 
If. Not we didn't come through 
Knowin'. The South is all of that 
But. For now I wan na know where the dogs is at 
 
This for the dogs in Virginia 
And, the dogs in Indiana 
And for the dogs out in Texas, 
Tennessee and Alabama 
And. For my dogs in Missouri 
And for my dogs in North Carolina 
And for my dogs in D.C 
And, the ones in Mississippi 
I know you, dogs in Nebraska,

And, the ones in Michigan,

From, the North to the East and West 
Again in the dirty South come on

Woof, Woof ..., Where ya at 
Woof, Woof ..., Where ya, at Where ya, at Where ya, at
