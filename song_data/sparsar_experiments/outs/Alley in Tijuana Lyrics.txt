Alley in Tijuana Lyrics
by Viza.

So you wana see the world make your life better, now do the damn thing now.
baby cause you're a real go getter.
Its not that I think your not willing, can't do it or just dont wanna, but the.
way I see it lookin for you baby, you'll end up in an alley in Tijuana.
God forbid you do.
I gotta come find you.
Clean you up and take you home.
Get you a new pair of shoes.
Why you spendin my money?
You got yourself a new caddy?
Cuz the way you actin baby you don't need a man you need a daddy.

You'll end up in an alley in Tijuana.

Sneaking all round town with the wicked witch, keeping me up all night. Self.
destructive evil ways and I don't wanna put up a fight.

Why you taking all them Ménage à trois don't you know them diseases are scary..
130 miles an hour on the freeway girl, living in a whole in the cemetery.

You'll end up in an alley in Tijuana.
