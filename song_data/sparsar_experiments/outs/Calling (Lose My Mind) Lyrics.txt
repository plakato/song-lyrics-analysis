Calling (Lose My Mind) Lyrics
by Swedish House Mafia.


Can we freeze karma and surrender.
Our rights and wrongs.
Can we just for a night let the stars.
Decide where we belong.
Maybe heaven right now is a devil.
Or angel away.
That won't change.
Together we vow that our colors.
Will sparkle the faith.
And I will find you.
I will find you.
I will reach you.
Or I, I, I will lose my mind.
Lose my mind.
Lose my mind.
Lose my mind.
Lose my mind, yeah!
I will lose my mind.
Yeah.
Lose my mind.
Yeah.
Maybe heaven right now is a devil.
Or angel away.
That won't change.
Together we vow that our colors.
Will sparkle the faith.
And I will find you.
I will find you.
I will reach you.
Or I, I, I will lose my mind.
Lose my mind.
I will lose my mind.
Yeahhh.
Lose my mind.
Yeahhhh.
