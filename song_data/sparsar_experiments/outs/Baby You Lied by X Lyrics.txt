Baby You Lied by X Lyrics
by X.

You got lost in the dark last night. 
The road was empty 
Sittin' in your car. You saw a black and white 
Doin' a hundred and twenty 
Baby. You lied when you loved me 
To you. The whole thing was a fake 
And, now you're stuck out in the wilderness, 
In the middle of a big mistake. 
Baby, you lied. I even understand why 
I'm lookin' at a candy bar you left behind 
I'll, make you be forgiven. 
Baby. You lied, 
You smelled like shit. This mornin' 
But refused to crawl back home 
A black snake never moves backwards. 
You both will spend your life alone 
Baby. You lied when you left me 
Another line in your private joke. 
I hope you had a good time. Watchin' 
Your life go up in smoke. 
Baby! You lied. I even understand why 
I'm watchin' a musical monkey unwind 
Hopin' to be forgiven. 
Baby, you lied, 
Your car broke down. You sat for an hour, 
Chewin' on your hand, 
You fix it yourself. It'S not your fault. 
That. The world is so unfair 
Baby. You lied on Sunday 
Workin' on the day of rest. 
The fact that I could lead you 
Proves that you're no best 
Baby, you lied. I even understand why 
Lipstick and Gideon's runaway signs 
Wasted livin' 
Baby you lied. Uh baby, you lied. Baby. You lied,
