Whatever Tho' Lyrics
by Woodie.


I might of shot your homies 
Once or twice you never know. 
But. I still walk the streets 
So. I assumed they let it go 
But, just in case they didn't 
I pack metal for clever folks 
So. All that talk in breakin' Woodie off 
Whatever tho', 
, 
Woodie 
I'm, still puttin' it down 
Sidin' through the town, Yoc bound 
Suckas wan na talk down. 
But ain't prepared to cock down 
They wan na bang like killas 
But, don't bang with no killas 
They wan na claim they killas 
But, don't hang with no killas 
This is Antioch the A-N-T-I-O-C-H 
And, I'm the one who brought the Yoc 
Up out the Golden State. 
You wan na hate this 
Hate yourself, 
Think your from the Yoc 
Talkin' down on my name 
Cuz. I ain't askin', you to jock 
Just, recognize 
From, two professional years of rappin' 
East Co. Co. Records, puttin' this
crap 
Back in time on the map 
And, then some 
We takin' nationwide infected 
Each and every nook and cranny 
Were that Yoc life bakins' 
And. I reckon 
We'll be collectin' dividends along the way. 
And. That'S exactly were this. Haterism comes into play, 
What's there to say 
Nothin', but hot ones, 
I got for those talkin' down on me. 
 
Woodie 
Come on haters. Try to stop this 
Dig deep into your pockets. 
Cuz that'll give me a legit reason: 
To make yo knot twist, not this 
Northern fella, Antioch dwella 
Won't fall hostage, 
To the thoughts and plots of the jealous 
Your gon na watch. This 
Independent label succeed 
Were re-precautions 10-4 for 
Every homey that bleeds 
We'll plant our seeds. In some mattress 
And watch our killas grow 
Teach'em everything we know 
So that they gon na run the show 
I'm talkin' fathers and sons, 
Uncles and nephews, packin' guns, 
Holdin' down the fort 
Prepared for war, 
Protectin' loved one 
No, more snatchin' up our dreams; 
Through the dope On triple beams, 
Or an enemy shot, 
Cuz, that's the power. Money brings 
We're the kings of our own plot. 
We found a spot. 
Don'T make room 
If, you think we're bluffin' 
I assume you have a skank too 
So. If you wan na, get me 
Come and get me 
Quit, talkin' 
And send the messages through bitches 
Cuz that shit'll leave. You chopped up. 
 
Woodie 
You wan na talk behind my back 
And jaw, jack amongst female company 
And. Every word up out your mouth 
Eventually gon'. Come to me 
How dumb, could you be 
Maybe? You really wan na see me 
But most likely you a sucka 
And, you hatin', you can't be me. 
Probably got that A-D-D 
Attention Deficit Disorder, 
And, you've notice. When you say my name, 
That people won't ignore ya. 
That'S. Pathetic 
Just, another sorry chump in the game. 
Go ahead keep bumpin' my name 
Cuz your just pumpin', my fame 
But. When we cross paths, 
Haul ass 
Or be prepared to aim 
Cuz. I'M a draw fast, 
Cock blast, 
With heat to tear your brain 
Cuz. I'Ve HAD IT UP TO HERE
echoes 
Do your history. 
I got my stripes 
Sucka. You ain't pumpin' fears, 
So come here and get a dose of 
This Antioch West Twompsta 
The demon in me wants to 
Go back to a monsta 
And put this music shit on stand by 
To make a man die. 
How. Do I cope with this 
I focus on the grand prize, 
 
Nothin', but hot ones? I got for those talkin' down on me. 
 
Shit echoes out
