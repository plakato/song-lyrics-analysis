Fallen Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


Oh no, watch me go.
Try to fly but I'm not home.
I can go when you can go.
My wings seem to be, struggling, tied to me.
I can breathe when you can breathe.

Can't stand the rain when the rain is inside of me.
Light up the dark but the light is too hard to see.
You know I could never fly.
No time to bleed when the blood rushes to your head.
Pain isn't pain when you're waking up feeling dead.
You know I could never fly.

Oh no, watch my tears.
These are not hard to miss, these are from happiness.
Lost my mind when I fell down.
Life is a shame, all the same.
Try to play, it's all a game.
Lost a turn and gained my name.
