It's Dangerous Business Walking Out Your Front Door Lyrics
by Underoath.

I've been up at this all night long.
I've been drowning in my sleep.
I've prayed for your safe place.
And it's time for us to leave.

Time is running, it's running on empty.
And the gas is running out.
I've decided that tonight is the night that I let love aside.
Full speed ahead, this seems to be the place.
I've seen this once before.
Planned perfection sought in my dreams.
Hoping this would take you home.

My knuckles have turned to white.
There's no turning back tonight.
Kiss me one last time.
Shut your eyes.
So hold on tight.

Around this turn where the cross will cast your shadow.
The people will all gather to remember such a day.
Where the flames grew as high as trees.
And the world stopped, it stopped for you and me.

I will now bring new meaning to the word alone.
Endless nights of dreaming of life.
And the days we should have spent here.

Drowning in my sleep, I'm drowning in my sleep.

Glass shatters and comes to a halt.
I thought we'd be there by now.
I thought it would be so much quicker than this.

Pain has never been so brilliant.
I made sure you were buckled in.
Now you can walk hand in hand.
Hand in hand with him.
