Synthia Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.

He's in love with a girl.
Her name is Synthia.
She is beautiful and grey.
He is going to see her today.
They are going to the show.
His confidence is low.
He will pick her up at 8.
She'll be waiting at the gate.

The music is loud.
They don't have much to talk about.
The lights are off.
It is hard to see.
She blinks her left red eye.
Reaches out and says.
Would you mind if I leave?
