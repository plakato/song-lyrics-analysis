Everywhere Lyrics
by Xhoshi Cami.

Every way i go i see running fast but i lost.
My mind has gone i don't know were is my home.
I boht a cow but she started to milk now.
I don't know what to do but you don't know.
What i've been throuh.
Now why is everybody trying to catch me.
But i don't know what to see put your hand's.
And follow me from the 313 now go and stop me.
I am a Rap Genius but you don't know that my dick.
Is refelleyes.
