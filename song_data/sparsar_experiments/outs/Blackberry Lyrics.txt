Blackberry Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


Your prize possession.
You never leave her at home.
Always faithfully.
By your side.
So good at turning her on.

The way you touch her.
Dial her up whenever.
Tell her everything cause she's a communicator.

She knows all your secret.
Always got her in your head.
Cause she makes you a better man.

I'm so jealous of your blackberry, blackberry.
Give me attention.
Like you give your blackberry, blackberry.

I want you to turn me on.
Push my buttons.
Let me in your light.
Keep me by your side.
I wanna be just like, your blackberry, your blackberry.

Talking with her constantly.
Your connection to the whole wide world.
If you're there.
That's where she'll be.
Like she's your favorite girl.

Can you touch me.
Kiss me.
Talk to me.
Oooh.
Hold me and confide me.

Don't break me.
Lose me.
Baby, don't make let fall.

Push my buttons, baby.
And turn me on.
Blackberry.
Blackberry.

Can you do that.
Like you do with yours.
Blackberry.
Blackberry.

I want you to protect me.
So that I never ever fall.
Cause if I do you'll break my heart.
Just give me what you give your blackberry.

Blackberry.
Your blackberry.
Your blackberry.
