I'm, just riding round in the city, 
Back seat with OG gas in 
Got, a shooter with me who I know will never tell 
 maneuver 12, don't know who moving 
Cause, I'm trapping out an Uber 
I'm trapping out an Uber 
I'm trapping out The Uber 
I'm trapping out an Uber 
Yeah yeah 
 
Trapping out the Uber in these Chanel 
This shit. I'M kicking 40 clip extended 
Crusing through the city got a shooter with me. 
Nigga owe me money, I'm pulling up to get it 
Ever fuck a I'm just 
When. I feel like riding dirty Uber pull up in a second 
In, the back seat, weighing grams where you can catch me. 
On Instagram flexing ice on Wayne, Gretsky 
Hit, the block make a sale dodging 12 dirty scale. 
Trap smart never fail satisfy your clientele, 
We be pouring strong gas Hulk. Hogan second 
Slow motion hope the driver know where he going 
 
Trapping out the Uber and I'mma tip the driver, 
Smoke Gotti in Chicago. He give no fucks about it. 
I'M from 50 dollars ride that, like 20 thousand 
He, won't pull up in that hood. He say my youngin watching 
Finesse you out wipe a nigga's nose 
Come in this bitch feeling like Pac, you can picture me rolling, 
, fully loaded ride, round extra dirty 
Geeked up feeling nerdy the Rolex cost, a 30 
I just rolled through your hood, and I didn't See you in it 
 told me, go get the money I did in 30 minutes 
I might pay Uber to drive to Cali hop out in 
Just to say I did it that might cost a ticket
