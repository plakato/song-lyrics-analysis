Be There Lyrics
by UNKLE.

You don't wanna go there.
Let me lead you by the hand.
You don't wanna be there.
Over the sea and down to land.

As I look into your eyes.
I pay no mind.
I found the way.
To get inside you.
I'd give you peace of mind.

I might see you falling.
I might see you falling.
I might see you falling beautiful.
This time.

I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling beautiful.
Sometimes.

You don't wanna go there.
Let me lead you by the hand.
You don't wanna be there.
Over the sea and down to land.

As I look into your eyes.
I pay no mind.
I found the way.
To get inside you.
Id give you peace of mind.

I might see you falling.
I might see you falling.
I might see you falling beautiful.
This time.

I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling beautiful.
Sometimes.

Here and again.
And there you are.

Falling, falling, falling.
Falling, falling, falling.

I might see you falling.
I might see you falling.
I might see you falling beautiful.
This time.

I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling beautiful.
Sometimes.

I might see you falling.
I might see you falling.
I might see you falling beautiful.
This time.

I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling beautiful.
Sometimes.

Falling, falling, free.

I don't see you falling.
I don't see you falling.

Corrupt, a plea for free will.
An irresponsible horrorshow.
It has been suggested.
That this contradictory -.
