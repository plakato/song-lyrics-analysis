Everything Lyrics
by Syko.

Jumpin' straight into it, like double dutch 

Uh 
And, I know I'm gon na win, but just wait till the last minute man 
Because before you know it. I'Mma hit yo ass with everything 
But for now i'll. Take it easy and watch you try to strike me 
But. I'M not a match bro, so you will never light me or, like me, 
Cause I'mma beat you at this every time, 
I'm, not even tryn' man. I close my eyes through every rhyme, 
And yo. Don'T even try to sneak past me. 
My eyes may be closed, but i'll wake up before you catch me, 
Yuh 
This ain't like tortoise and the hare 
And, even if it was what makes you think that I would care 
If you're the hare and got 2 pairs of legs much faster than my unprepared. 
4 tiny legs I bear cause i'll still win, even though it's unfair, 
Uh, huh, 
Slow and steady wins the race 
And, I'm moving so slow me and a snail keep a similar pace. 
And yet 
I'm way ahead of you and out ya reach 
No. One expected me to win as if my name was screech 
Yuh 
And. This is only just a taste 
Cause. If I gave you everything at once, you'd overdose and cast suspense 
On listeners 
That are still sitting on the fence. 
And wondering whether they want to jump down on the side. That'S making sense
 
I guess the title was misleading. Oh well 
Now it's too late because I'm leaving farewell
