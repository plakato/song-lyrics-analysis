Worthless Endeavor Lyrics
by Rune.

We, the laden and uninspired.
Lie dormant at the footsteps of the last day.
Measured outside the dilapidated.
Structure of society.
Dead under a sea of waste.
This is the shallow shell we've crawled inside....
The warmth and comfort we'd hoped to find....
The world we occupy.
All is ours to taint with touch....
Fading away.
False hopes breed ignorance.
There will come a time when simplicity shall reign again....
Long after we are gone.
