Victoria Lyrics
by Univore.

She drinks the chardonnay.
She watch the baseball game.
Expensive lingerie.
She wears because the other girls do.
Because the other girls do.

She was married in America.
Hot shit, her name's Victoria.

She visit Portland.

She wants to move there cause.
She thinks that it's a thing to do.
A thing to do.

You want to talk to her.
You want to buy her drink.
She'll have a ? with two onions.
But she won't have you.
She won't have you.
