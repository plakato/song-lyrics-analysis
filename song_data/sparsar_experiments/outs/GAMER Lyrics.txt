GAMER Lyrics
by Xpertthief.


G-A-M-E-R 
Spell it out bitch, that's who we are 
Locked and loaded. My controller out, the holster. Yes, you know it's time to go
to war, 
Sniper rifle ready one shot and your head is confetti. 
Semi auto burst it's the worst. When your whole team ain't even ready, get ready, 
 
Now drop back in your zone charging my moves like cellular phones, 
, 
Well, guess what you about to get owned 
Play all day every day. Sorry, if you call me, you get voice mail, baby, 
Only, two away from getting dogs and my dawgs in the game, with AK's going crazy 
That's how we do it, though chopper gunner man ima, need two of those 
Semtex get wrecked. Get stuck reflex like a freak control, hit the peak 
Snipe game so lethal pro, so grizz like a bear, send chills through your bones
get killed. 
My game is on top see my name at the top 
You gon na need to get a shield. When you see me 
When you on the battlefield, better fear me 
The steel from my gun, right on your heel, be 
Stacking them banana clips. No peel, please 
Throw your body in the marsh, like Randy 
Your team gon na get crushed like candy 
Shotgun on your cheeks. Like sandy 
Things, looking real grim, Billy and Mandy 
 
G-A-M-E-R spell it out bitch, that's who we are 
Locked and loaded, my controller out, the holster. Yes, you know it's time to go
to war, 
Sniper rifle ready one shot and your head is confetti. 
Semi auto burst. It'S the worst when your whole team ain't even ready, get ready
