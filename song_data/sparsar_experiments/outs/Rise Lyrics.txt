Rise Lyrics
by Zino.


I might fall on my back but I'm still gon' rise.
I got my faith in my god I'm gonna be all right.
What else can I say I be repping the bay.
But somehow the truth always winds up missing.
Cuz everybody talks but nobody listens.

First and foremost let me define my name.
K to the E the undeniable saint.
And just like those before me man I have a real story to tell.
Or just share as I prevail.
I never really had it all but I still stood tall and I still do it all.
Cuz impossible is nothing just do it like it's nothing.
Especially for those who be rocking adidas clothes with fresh air max on.
See I never follow trends cuz you know life goes on.
So look at me I keep telling them look at me.
See this man I came to be through this life of misery.
Then I look up in the mirror man I saw but didn't see.
That this would be my remedy music to the death of me.
I'll never change the fact that it ain't nobody stopping me.
I got nightmares that be haunting me of what's gon' be left of me.

So what's the message?
With all these flaws that I'm mentioning.
I just wanna go live it the come back for the minute.
But I'll be gone in a second just to live and making records.
To the people that be checking for my city I rep it.
During them cold time man they'll never catch me slippin'.
While they're busy tryna sleep man I'm busy in my dreams.
Saying life ain't cheap Gordon Gekko lifestyle.
That's the man I wanna be.
Say my shit be so timeless like these rhymes that I'm rhyming.
Nobody worth my time and nobody do my grind.
And I do it all the time make 'em wonder where I'm at.
But still be thinking 'bout the past man we ain't got time for that.
Let my man Newton do the math.
Then you sure will understand ain't nothing worth a damn.
And they might never wanna hear this.
'Cuz at the end of the day it's something they gotta deal with.
