by Z-Ro.

Z-Ro 
I ain't having none of that riff-raff. So act like you know that I ain't
friendly 
Treat everybody I come across, like they wan na put something in me: 
Like some lead or if I'm moving weight, they might set me up with the FEDs 
But to a boy done, shed I'm one deep trying to get Bread 
And I'm one deep when I bust heads cause I'm not gon na tell on me 
When a snitch be rolling with you. You headed to felony 
I ain't ready to do 85 percent of nobody's time, 

A-R 1-5 AK-56, plus one 
It's, multiple homicide. If I happen to touch one 
You, niggas, gon, learn or you niggas are gon burn 
It get hotter than lava when it come down to the dolla 
And I got ta. Have it by any means necessary, 
Guaranteed to see a million before the cemetery 
So. I keep on watching and my 4-4 keep on cocking 
If my folks keep on droppin B-O double P-E-R's keep on boppin. I ain't stoppin, 
, 
We ain't. Having none of that bullshit 
Represent till I die Hiram-Clarke Mo City, my hood bitch 
Get out of dodge cause. We ain't no play thang 
See me and keeping it gangsta all day. Mayn 
 
Lil, Head 
In, my life. I keep it gangsta all day, 
In my life. I could peep a wanksta a mile away, 
In my life. I trust me and nobody else, 
That's why I walk around with a nine tucked in my belt 
Don't. Let the small size fool. You try to play me for weak 
Cause. I pull this four pound bar and blaze at your beat. 
You got niggas. I got niggas but my niggas, the best 
See, my niggas. All my niggas is guerillas with techs 
Lil Head the 43' giant respect my name. 
In order to live a longer life. You got ta respect the game; 
Now, listen! Mayn! I'M trying to tell you some' for your own good 
See, I'm the type of nigga. Have you bailing out your own hood 
I'm, a General a Sergeant? No need to start this 
Rumble in the field with a lion cause I'm raw, bitch, 
I'm raw, regardless whether it's four to one 
Cause, the pop from the Glock. I know it's gon na go through one 
, 
Z-Ro 
I'm, not your kin folk. So I suggest you get out of dodge 
1-25 road raging ready to get out and squab 
Too many problems in my life. I just can't handle the stress 
Niggas be trying to kill me damn near dismantling my vest 
But. I can take it cause. I dish it out. You got your gun, 
I got my gun and I'm busting before you get a chance to whoop it out. 
A soldier folding up a motherfucker what he need for me, 
Either with a gun or with a fist. Anyway, it go. I'M still gon fold him 
What. You thought I was a fraud, a hoe, a punk 
Don't make me make you say: oh Lord shut, the fuck up 
I handle my bidness and then I move around in the night 
So much codeine. It feel like. I got a pound of the Sprite 
So, keep my temper, calm, collective and cool 
Cause. I might ignite and go off and leave nothing, but your shoes 
To keep my temper calm, collective and cool 
Cause. I might ignite and go off and leave nothing, but your shoes
