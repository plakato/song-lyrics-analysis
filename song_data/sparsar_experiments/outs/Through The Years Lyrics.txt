Through The Years Lyrics
by Zsa Zsa Padilla.

I can't remember when you werent there.
When I didn't care for anyone but you.
I swear weve been through everything there is.
Can't imagine anything weve missed.
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do.
Through the year, youve never let me down.
You turned my life around, the sweetest days Ive found.
Ive found with you … through the years.
Ive never been afraid, Ive loved the life weve made.
And Im so glad Ive stayed, right here with you.
Through the years.
I can't remember what I used to do.
Who I trusted whom, I listened to before.
I swear youve taught me everything I know.
Can't imagine needing someone so.
But through the years it seems to me.
I need you more and more.
Through the years, through all the good and bad.
I knew how much we had, Ive always been so glad.
To be with you … through the years.
Its better everyday, youve kissed my tears away.
As long as its okay, Ill stay with you.
Through the years.
Through the years, when everything went wrong.
Together we were strong, I know that I belonged.
Right here with you … through the years.
I never had a doubt, wed always work things out.
Ive learned what loves about, by loving you.
Through the years.
Through the years, youve never let me down.
Youve turned my life around, the sweetest days Ive found.
Ive found with you … through the years.
Its better everyday, youve kissed my tears away.
As long as its okay, Ill stay with you.
Through the years!
