Missing You (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
by Tyler Hilton.

Everytime I think of you.
I always catch my breath.
I'm still standing here.
And your miles away.
And I wonder why you left me.
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight.

I hear your name in certain circles.
And it always makes me smile.
I spent my time just thinkin about you.
And its almost driving me wild.

But its my heart thats beggin down this long distance line tonight.

And I ain't missin' you at all.
Since you've been gone... Away.
I ain't missin' you.
No matter what I might say.

There's a message in the wires.
And I am sendin' you a signal tonight.
You don't know how desperate I've become.
And It looks like I'm loosein' this fight.

But it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mine.

But I ain't missin' you at all.
Since you've been gone... Away.
I ain't missin' you at.
No matter what my friends say.

And there's a message that I'm sendin' out.
Like a telograph to you or something.

Honey, stop this heart ache all alone.

I ain't missin' you at all.
Since you've been gone... Away.
I ain't missin' you.
No matter what my friends say.
I ain't missin' you.
Since you've been gone... Away.
I ain't missin you.
Yeah, no matter what your friends say.

Hey yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

I ain't missin you at all.
Since you've been gone... Away.
I ain't missin' you.
Nooo.
