Came To Fly Lyrics
by Zio zane.


Wossup wit, you 
Ya'll want no trouble. 
I fuck the game up 
Check my triple double 
I done came from. The bottom saw my momma struggle, 
Hallucination of money 
While, my stomach rumble, 
 
All, I ever wanted was a chevy. 
We was wildin' through my MAAD City, 
Them niggas couldn't fuck wit, us 
Waitin' for G O D to come Visit. We ain't have his digits. 
They said money, ain't, no issue 
As. I dream of figures. 
You know the ghetto perspective. 
You get the picture: 
No snapchat, 
We, hat snapback, 
But, no tattoos 
Scars. All over my dark skin 
Ya'll born to lose 
 
I handle my binness 
I mean I handle myself 
See, i'm the business nigga 
Like, all by myself, 
Niggas can't fuck wit me. No more 
I'm, like the ex bitch in this bitch 
Niggas, can't ball no more 
They. On the wrong pitch in this bitch 
Straight from South Africa 
So, I got me: blue Mandelas 
I'm aiming high like I'mmm 
In roc, a fellcall me a 
El padrino head of la familia 
If. We ain't fly nigga. Then you must a lie: 
 
Then! You must be a lie: 
Cause We Came To Fly. 
Cause We Came To Fly, 
So must be a lie, 
Must be a lie. 
Say We Came To Fly 
Cause, We Came To Fly 
 
Nigga, you, a joke, 
Kevin Hart be bragin' bout, ya'll 

You'll think I outchea. Looking for my green card, 
Yeah thats, what my homie said: 
She is American 
So, hello, miss America, 
I been doing fine thinking all about my taxes and the fines you combine 
Plus. I barely got a job 
Fuck, a 925 24 in the booth 27 behind bars, 
Thats. Just the stereo type 
Bitch dont kill my vibe 
I, keep my Circle small, Majestic we so aytt 
Rock the beat is tied. 
I goes like a pipe 
Fuck. This other niggas cuz I ride for my dawgs 
Man I die for the picture. 
Mandela would be proud. 
I'M. Just a black kid wit, a long and wide knowledge 
And, I ain't lie imma, get all in college 
Till. I reach the White house and make changes get the message. 
 
Then, you must be a lie. 
Cause We Came To Fly. 
Cause We Came To Fly. 
So must be a lie: 
Must be a lie. 
Say We Came To Fly 
Cause. We Came To Fly
