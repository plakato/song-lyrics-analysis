Chanel (Remix) Lyrics
by NuLOVE.

Procrastinating on essays I got to turn in.
Instead I hit a party, they smoking, drinking for certain.
Sitting with this girl, she's confessing that she's a virgin.
And she just wants to drink up, somebody fill her drink up.
Everybody hold your drinks up.
By the end of the night, she'll probably throw her drink up.
Swallowing all that pink stuff, puffing on all that green stuff.
Spill enough emotions to probably fill your sink up.
All that crying, they saying that you're a drama queen.
Just another sloppy teen, but hey.
They don't know how your life is behind the scenes.
You just want to get away, so come here and take these shots with me.
And turn the music up, cause she only wants to dance.
These niggas would do anything to get you out your pants.
How could I blame them? Your body's banging, you look amazing.
Thinking that I'm in love, that'll prolly change in the AM.
Do you do it for attention? You tried to tell them that you only.
Do it cause there's tension all throughout your life and now.
Cupid got precision, he shooting where he wishes.
You drowning in the alcohol you snoozing with the fishes.
You get it in or get it on, you getting left, you get it right?
You fall in love with all the ones, you never thought you'd ever like.
Damn, that's not how your momma raised ya.
But I guess its true, only time can change ya.
And when I see you at school.
You gon' be looking at me like everything is so cool.
And you don't remember shit, how could your heart forget?
You just putting up them walls like an architect.
See I'm not looking for love, I just want to give some advice.
If you're in so much pain, why continue living that life?
I know you're better that.
Well I don't really know, but I thought you would be better than that.
This little tie we have, I'm severing that.
Cause I don't want to make your life worse than it is.
Nah, thought you would be better than that.
Thought you would be better than that.
