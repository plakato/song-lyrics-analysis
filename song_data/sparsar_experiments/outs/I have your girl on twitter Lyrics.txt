I have your girl on twitter Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Distance loves to be far away from home.

Studying over and over till i get it.

Because she loves my music i be writing down.

I have your girl on twitter following me.

Playing my favorite tone like a radio.

Books in my brain.

Preying for my enemies.

Clap twice when she drops to the ground.

You know people find u quick.

Someone always gets hurt by to many words.

Never trust to many.

I be portending they don't exist.

I got the best ammo for em bullets to fast to touch.

Where they at boring people.

Trust the few u got can't trust to many around here back can be turned on u.
real quick by two face ppl real talk.

Spot light on me stay shining like a star in the sky.

I got the ladies live on the cam show just got started.

Staying fresh out the store gotta show off the new.
