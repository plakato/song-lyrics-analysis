In Eighty Four Lyrics
by The Undead.


They got me on the tele-screen.
The Thought Police are at my back door.
I can't protest, I can't scream.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
There is no room for individuals.
Big Brother watches every move you make.
No room for human thougts at all.
If you object you very life's at stake.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
Nineteen eighty four.
Things are run so conveniently.
When we stop thinking for ourselves.
In the interest of pre-ordained schemes.
We play the role while we should rebel.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
Nineteen eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
So well controlled in eighty four.
