Ghost Lyrics
by XOV.


Bang bang, with the devil's gun.
She shot me.
Man down, it's a hut and run.
You got me.

Was it all a lie?
Did you ever want me?
In your arms, I died.
Won't let you haunt me.

You are the ghost I can't forget, oh-ah, oh-ah.
You are the ghost inside my head, oh-ah, oh-ah.
Oh oh oh, you are the ghost I can't forget.
Oh oh oh, you are the ghost, ghost.

Bang bang, don't wake the dead.
Forget you.
I'm him with the dragons head.
I'll get you.

Was it all a lie?
Did you ever want me?
In your arms, I died.
Won't let you haunt me.

You are the ghost I can't forget, oh-ah, oh-ah.
You are the ghost inside my head, oh-ah, oh-ah.
Oh oh oh, you are the ghost I can't forget.
Oh oh oh, you are the ghost, ghost.

Dead lock, an endless loop.
So many games without the fun.
I'm out, fuck you.
Here's a bullet and a gun.

Was it all a lie?
Did you ever want me?
In your arms, I died.
Won't let you haunt me.

You are the ghost I can't forget, oh-ah, oh-ah.
You are the ghost inside my head, oh-ah, oh-ah.
Oh oh oh, you are the ghost I can't forget.
Oh oh oh, you are the ghost, ghost.
