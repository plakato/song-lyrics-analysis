No Way Out Lyrics
by Voice.

Stormy wind opens the gate.
And stuffy smoke spreads in the air.

Your heart begins to pound.
Screams hurt in your eyes.
A cold hand touches you.
You're looking in a face of fear.
A hundred sins remembered.
And find the way through your brain.
Your brain.

No way out.
Fight against your addictions.
Suppress all your doubts.
Believe in your power.
Between madness and reality.
Search your true identity.

Can you see the black clouds rising.
Thunder rolls over hills.

Chasing shadows, assault on your mind.
On the devil's train across your life.
You feel a choke in your throat.
And sweat burns in your eyes.
In the search of the way out.
Don't migrate with the birds of prey.

No way out.
Fight against your addictions.
Suppress all your doubts.
Believe in your power.
Between madness and reality.
Search your true identity.
No way out....
