IRock Chemical Lyrics
by Two Crown King.


Street corner sick song, mega city, mashup 
Come catch a glimpse where the 80's never packed up, 
Bus, stop or bell tower –'bring em out, 
Back packs packed up, but what they giving out. 
Lost artists pick pockets for the in and out 
Embodied by the very people that they bring about 
We make an innocent assessment. 
People don't put the bad news on the guest list. 
Text it., -- money stretched way out. 
 
 
Ohhh., My 
Lights so bright – so bright, 
Ohhh., Simple curiosity, 
Just one night 
Just one night 
Just one night, 
Nights incredible., iRock chemical 
Bow to the power when the bass meets the beautiful 
 
Jump to the beat of the heart you stole 
Ghetto grind down In size as a 
Make, a 6 to a 10 in a 5.0 
Like, a scratch to an itch. Like a one man show 
When every other brothers got a pop to lock. 
You can yes, rest assured that my walk can talk. 
And, the chalk on the sidewalk stays the same 
\-, no matter how hard it rains: 
 
Refrain, 
Not, forgettable., iRock, chemical 
, 
 
With, the time we've got. And the I've seen 
Lost sight of following your wayward dreams. 
The stop in stop. Go round and never cease. 
Well, I'm cashing out. I've gone and made my peace 
 
Give me the get rich schemes. I'll, never quarter back 
Pick. Six Too many to push past 
Hail Marry in a No wings 
A lot of chit-chat for a cat with no rings 
Good God. You've got ta. Give it a shot, though 
It's not dope, being blunted and living in pot smoke 
20 plus plus is closer to 30. 
You can hash tag it. However, you feel 
 
Nights incredible. iRock chemical 
Bow to the power when the bass meets the beautiful 
, 
Refrain
