Something Good Can Work Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

There's a spanner in the works, you know.
You gotta step up your game to make to the top.
So go!

Got a little competition now.
You're going to find it hard to cope with living on your own now.
Uh oh! Uh oh!

Let's make this happen, girl.
You gotta show the world that something good can work.
And it can work for you.
And you know that it will.
Let's get this started girl.
We're moving up, we're moving up.
It's been a lot to change.
But you always get what you want.

It took a little time to make a little better.
It's only going up, just one thing and another.
You know, you know.

It took a little time to make a little better.
It's only going up, just one thing and another.
You know, you know.
