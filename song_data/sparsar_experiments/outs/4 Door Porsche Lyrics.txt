4 Door Porsche Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.

Rewind: Wooh Da Kid.
9/25/09.
Bullet in my pelvis, I'm.
tryin' to stay alive.
Crawl into my car, toss the cannon to my homie.
A real solider in the war, never leave you lonely.

I'm just cruising in my 4 door Porsche.
I don't know where I'm going, I just know I'm lost.
I thank god for the wars that I've fought.
Because I'm still standing and a lesson was taught.

Wooh Da Kid.
9/25/09.
Bullet in my pelvis, I'm tryin' to stay alive.
Crawl into my car, toss the cannon to my homie.
A real solider in the war, never leave you lonely.
I ain't speakin on the rest.
Cause if I froze up, it would of have been death.
It would have been stress, for you and your.
If I never did perform, trustin in the lord.
Because I'm.
Still standing from the bullet I caught.
Two little boys on the way is my thoughts.
's here, yeah daddys still here.
In the 4 door Porsche, riding in second gear.

I'm just cruising in my 4 door Porsche.
I don't know where I'm going, I just know I'm lost.
I thank god for the wars that I've fought.
Because I'm still standing and a lesson was taught.

I'm just sipping in my four door.
One girl in the front, but I think I need four more.
Come and kick it with your boy boy.
I can't be found, I know I'm lost.
Fuckin to the law, take me away.
I thank god for seeing another day.
Lookin out my window mayne, dealers servin every day.
Catching minor charges for walking around with mary jane.
Decided to change my life, never will I feel that burn again.

So much dope need oxygen, about 20 keys is flyin in.
Just like my nigga biggie smalls said, steady countin on Benjamins.

I'm just cruising in my 4 door Porsche.
I don't know where I'm going, I just know I'm lost.
I thank god for the wars that I've fought.
Because I'm still standing and a lesson was taught.

I close my eyes and think sometimes.
Which way to go away from here?
I don't even know but all I know is take me away from here.
Big bruh told me chill out, come on take a ride with me.
I keep growing impatient, Wooh keeps telling me patients.
I can't take it, I stare out this tinted window god damn.
I miss my niggas, looking in this rear view window.
I've been thugging since I can't remember.
Sister help me, I think I need guidance.
I just need direction, so which way are we driving?
Cahootz sit back take this nigga rolo.
Cause I gotta play it cool when that four door roll up.
Showin up, show up, doing my thing, donuts.
Brick Squad monopoly  so what?

I'm just cruising in my 4 door Porsche.
I don't know where I'm going, I just know I'm lost.
I thank god for the wars that I've fought.
Because I'm still standing and a lesson was taught.
