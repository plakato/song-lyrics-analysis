Smokin' Lyrics
by Boston.


We're gonna play you a song, a little bit of rock-n-roll.
You gotta let yourself go, the band's gonna take control.
We're gettin' down today.
We'll pick you up and take you away.
Get down tonight.

Smokin', smokin'.
We're cookin' tonight, just keep on tokin'.
Smokin', smokin'.
I feel alright, mamma I'm not jokin', yeah.

Get your feet to the floor, everybody rock and roll.
You've got nothing to lose just the rhythm and blues, that's all, yeah.

We're gonna feel okay.
We'll pick you up and take you away.
Get down tonight.

Everyone's jumpin', dancin' to a boogie tonight.
Clap your hands, move your feet.
If you don't you know it won't seem right.
We're gettin' down today.
We'll pick you up and take you away.
Get down tonight.
