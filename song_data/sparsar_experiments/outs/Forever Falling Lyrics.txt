Forever Falling Lyrics

Forever Falling.
Produced By Vo-Kal.

My shadow scared me.
I don't understand.
Cause it was dark out.
Maybe the shadows.
Are hiding everything I tried to mark out.
Inner demons.
Maybe my true self.
You say you see my goodness.
Tell my good bye bitch farewell.
Ones on the floor.
I ain't say that I was spending money.
But I got good friends.
And they entrepreneurs.
Throwing bills around.
Like the name Gates is funny.
You can stay or something.
I can't wait for nothing.
Bad bitches.
Giving good times.
In the back room.
Barely VIP.
Spilling out my heart.
With no IVs.

I don't have the patience.
To try and keep up with this fake shit.
So baby tell me what your name is.
So I can make sure I erase it.
From my memory.
These bitches just want to take away.
Everything I have to give a lover.
I'm drowning.
Trying to keep above the pressure of another.
I just don't want to feel the pain any more.
I thought I could fly but I just hit the floor.
So baby tell me what are you waiting for.
Waiting for.

You say you can save me.
I beg you not to do this.
You say you need me.
Girl stop acting foolish.
I can't be there for you.
When you hit the ground.
You can't trust me girl.
I'll just ignore the sound.

Now baby I don't have the faith in you.
Cause all these hoes are thotful.
And they paved the way for you.
And showed me just how awful.
But It's all I could imagine.
So strip it all and show me magic.
I'm thirsty for your touch.
I'm yearning for the way that you make me feel.
I'm just craving your kiss.
I'm longing for your tongue as it caresses my skin.
Slow motion.
Slow motion.
As you ride it out.
Don't want this time to end.
Baby show me what you're about.
Let's take this to the back.
Any price for you.
Just don't fall in love.
With the likes of me.
Cause I'll be gone as soon as we're through.

: X3.
You say you love me now it's too late.
I fell in love with girls that's too fake.
You say pure love is destined through fate.
But true lust and mistrust.
Is all they gave.

I wish I died the hero.
Cause I see myself becoming the villain.
I'm hardly sick.
Some party shit.
To drown out my feelings.
I miss the good times.
Drunk as fuck.
I miss the good time.
Two 40s of that OE.
Some whiskey shots.
And then I shined.
I need a beer bong.
To play beer pong.
Doing keg stands.
All year long.
Party life of some college kids.
But we skipped school.
For that party shit.
A year off.
That turned into four.
To never again.
Will I need to score.
An A+.
We got grade A.
I've been lost in life.
Since my 6th grade.

I know I can save you.
You begged me not to do this.
You know that I need you.
I'm not acting foolish.
Please I'll be there for you.
I won't hit the ground.
I'll trust you with my love.
Please don't ignore me now.

BREAKDOWN: Vo-Kal.
