Prod. By: MurphyKid.

I remember them days when I used to hang in the club.
So addicted to fame they say it's the same as a drug.
Not a lame or a scrub no that ain't what it was.
Knew this girl is somebody else's, i think i'm in love.
She know she bad, but what's new.
Maybe the baddest, I want you girl.
I gotta have it, but it do girl.
You cool girl, play by the rules girl.
Cuz, we catching feelin's fa sho.
You know the game and you know how it go.
Been keepin' shit on the low.
Girl i'ma g i'ma stick to the code.
Too many times I've been down this road.
Nobodies hurt if nobody knows.
Go head and call yo nigga tell him you ain't comin' home.

I got you creepin' got you creepin' yea.
You got a man at home, you know he cheatin'.
But you won't leave him what's the reason? yeah.
You know yo man a scrub, that ain't.

You'd rather get even you don't need him no.
He got you chasin' waterfalls.
That red light special got me gone.

You don't know, you don't know.

Ay, I know I got a lot of hoes ?
But I ain't never show this side before ? hey.

But you won't leave him what's the reason? yeah.
You know yo man a scrub, that ain't no real love.
You'd rather get even you don't need him no.
He got you chasin' waterfalls.
That red light special got me gone.
