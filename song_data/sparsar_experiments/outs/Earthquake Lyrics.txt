Earthquake Lyrics
by The Uncluded.


The wind and rain are here again.
And a powerless darkness had laid me down.
The lights are out all over town.
But the earthquake got me out of bed.
The earthquake got me out of bed.
See the little bird fly 'round his head.
As the little boy sits on the ground.
And makes the toy cars drive around.
It's a loss that I can't comprehend.
It's a loss that I can't comprehend.

Cause his mother died the other day.
He's only three years old.
Her body's gone but her soul is here to stay.
See the little birdy-watch him grow.
See the little birdy-watch him grow.

October ended with a single feather funneling its way.
To muddy Earth in front of funny sparrow copycatting.
Eventually it would select and circle one.
As if to pause and crown the victim of a loss I wasn't comprehending.

There's been a fundamental loss we aren't comprehending.

It's said the winged in post-mortal visitation echo well.
The stasis of a spirit taken from its only home.
A legend quoted by the wreathing of a grieving child.
When all that's left to do is sit and watch the creatures grow and grow.

Overlapping Audio.
Aesop Rock.
And grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow.
The winds and rain have begun inching in a frame.
Like darkness with a bounty on whatever lay me down.
The town had been retiring to its quarters as if waiting for the earthquake.

Kimya.
See the little birdy watch him grow.
The winds and rains and here again and a powerless darkness had laid me down.
The lights are out all over town but the earthquake got me out of bed.
The earthquake got me out of bed.
The earthquake got me out of bed.
The earthquake got me out of bed.
