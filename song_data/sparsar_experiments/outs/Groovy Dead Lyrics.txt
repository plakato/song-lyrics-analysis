Groovy Dead Lyrics
by Rusty.

Hello....
I hit top speed.
I smoke the dragon.
Into the loft.
I drag my asshole.
I stick my head under the pillow.
It's so groovy when I'm dead.
Pull the covers over head.
It's so groovy to be dead.
The phone it rings.
And it's the landlord.
The door it knocks.
And it's the devil.
Sleeps my gun.
I'm out of ammo.
It's so groovy when I'm dead.
Pull the covers over head.
It's so groovy when I'm dead X2.
It's groovy to be dead.
This sleepy death.
It makes me so slow.
I can't face life.
My soul is hollow.
I must get more.
To fill my black hole.
It's so groovy when I'm dead.
Pull the covers over head.
It's so groovy when I'm dead X2.
It's groovy to be dead.
Stick my head under the pillow... pillow... pillow... pillow....
