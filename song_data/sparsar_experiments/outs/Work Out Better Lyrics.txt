Work Out Better Lyrics
by Rusty.

Save her, please don't let her down.
I love her, please don't let her down.
Hold her, the pressure gets her down.
I told her, you can't let it get you down.
Things will work out Betty, but you are gonna have to try.
Things will work out Betty, but you are gonna have to try.
Free her, she can't think for herself.
Help her, she can't think for herself.
Things will work out Betty, but you are gonna have to try.
Things will work out Betty, but you are gonna have to try.
Things will work out Betty, but you are gonna have to try.
Things will work out Betty, but you are gonna have to try.
