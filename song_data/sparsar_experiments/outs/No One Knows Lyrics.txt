No One Knows Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.

We get some rules to follow.
That and this, these and those.
No one knows.

We get these pills to swallow.
How they stick in your throat.
Tastes like gold.

Oh, what you do to me.
No one knows.

Queens of the Stone Age.
And I realize you're mine.
Indeed a fool am I.
And I realize you're mine.
Indeed a fool am I.
Ahh.

I journey through the desert.
Of the mind with no hope.
I found low.

I drift along the ocean.
Dead lifeboats in the sun.
And come undone.

Pleasantly caving in.
I come undone.

Queens of the Stone Age.
And I realize you're mine.
And I realize you're mine.
And I realize you're mine.
Indeed a fool am I.
And I realize you're mine.
Indeed a fool am I.
Ahh.

Heaven smiles above me.
What a gift here below.
But no one knows.

A gift that you give to me.
No one knows.
