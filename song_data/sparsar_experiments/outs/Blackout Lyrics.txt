Blackout Lyrics
by Swollen Members.


 { *crowd cheering*, }, 
Oooh, 
Oooh, 
Ooooooooooh, oooh, 
, 
Prevail 
Prevail, the merciless mercenaries of militance 
No resemblance to any other assembly's heritage. 
Despair will be the downfall of arrogance. 
Repairs will be necessary too much heavy damage, counter intelligence, 
Spy craft flies, past P's, the aviator 
Resuscitation reincarnation, I'm the reanimator 
Greater mind power than Einstein, 
Genius and insanity. We walkin that fine line 
Talkin'bout prime time exposure face remains poker, 
Overload, the road to stardom like exploding, supernovas, 
Maintain composure, low visibility, violent turbulence, 
You, hear the voice of a surgeon and wake up in an ambulance 
You're out of your element, a graveyard of skeletons 
Elephants In a caravan cross, the mountain like Hannibal 
Light, the firing wicks make the air thick with cannonballs 
Nothin that I can't resolve. Chemicals meant to dissolve 
 
Mad, Child 
 Greed, pain and torture. 
Locked inside my room, I'm an insane sorcerer .
 What I'm saying Shane's forceful 
You, don't want to fuck with a vain Cain: Korso 
War master on a chosen path. 
You, don't wan na laugh at the sociopath 
Don't, try to act, hardcore just stay soft 
A, unchained pitbull'll rip your face off 
Backpack with a axe and a chainsaw 
Madchild's back I'mma grab what I came for. 
Masked bandit skin been branded. { *gunshots* } 
Smoke clears I'm the last man standing 
God blessed me with a gift, I'm so grateful 
Bent out of shape, but I still stay faithful, 
Purified poison, strength of gorilla, 
Mentally killer meant to be iller, 
, 
, { *instrumental for 27 seconds until the end* }
