Four Night Rider Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Cold wind whipping through the windows 
Freezing each of the lymph nodes 
Maybe we got ta, try 
To get out of town tonight, 
 
Well, I love you 
You know you love me and it shows 
Maybe. We got ta, try 
Let's crash at your place tonight. 
 
Grandpa's passed out on the couch 
Take, the greenbelt to your house, 
There's, a shortcut through the forest that smells 
There's a shortcut through the forest that smells 
 
As. We hit the front door 
All the clothes hit the floor. 
Maybe we got ta, try, 
To bike, outta town tonight, 
 
Well, I love you 
You know you love me and it shows 
Edmonton's. Just a four night bike ride, outta town 
, 
Cold, wind whipping through the windows 
Freezing each of the lymph nodes. 
Maybe we got ta, try, 
 
And. I love you 
And. You know you love me and it shows 
Edmonton's. Just a four night bike ride: outta town
