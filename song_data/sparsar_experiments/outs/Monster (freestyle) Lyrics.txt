Monster (freestyle) Lyrics
by Quilly.

5Am? Why is these smokers still Callin 
Niggas tried to take me out the game Im still Ballin 

Next month its gonn be a dime, no Bargin. I been 
Dickin down ya bitch from the rear, 
I been plottin on ya bitch all year, 
Circle small cuz, you niggas. All squares 
12 for the sweatsuit nigga this my ball gear 
I put my Bitches on Uber 
I. Put my niggas on pussy 
Im tryna build a empire. My bitch badder than Cookie 
I mean hot as Taraji that pussy wet as Dasani 
Sellin percs in the lobby. I been exchanging Armani 
I, send the money to Jails. My nigga buy you, some suits 
My nigga, just came home. Im bouta buy him some boots, 
Im bouta. Do it real big nigga gim me the loot, 
E and Reds Wit Truck Im. Bouta. Get me a coupe 
On, the Road to Riches goin to Jail was my worst route: 
Tell ya bitch. We still got the sour and them percs out. 
Pocket full of blue faces. Make me pull the smurfs out. 
Just hit the gym on you bitches, and that workout 
Rappers washed up bubble bath, get a tub for em 
Niggas wan na live my lifestyle Young Thug on Em 
Killin. These niggas Life support, pull the plug on em 
I ain't, really, where i wan na be. But I buzzed on Em 
17 I was on the Greyhound. 
My oldhead really flew them. Birds in from A-Town 
I came up Cuz. I stayed down 
I made 20 thousand dollars in a playground. 
Pill flippa cake, gaina 
I serve niggas curve. Bitches like waist trainas. 
I. Put my Lawyer on his Feet: 
Marshawn Lynch Im a Beast
