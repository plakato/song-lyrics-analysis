Gettin' Throwed Lyrics
by Two Fresh.


We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

Eyes low, puffing on that kush, cuz' you never hydro.
Ride slow, rear view mirror, check the five-o.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

Well if it isn't Mr Fresh, nigga, best dressed.
Thumbing through a check.
Pretty nigga with the fresh press.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

Well if it isn't young Towki, look like young Hiroki.
Pull up in that turtle time hoe, Master Roshi.
Had the bitches but I swear them bitches get too cozy.
Sorry I was late I had ...?
Now I'm getting profits, getting proceeds, it's a process.
Now I'm steady going up in key I'm changing octaves.
Shout to all my old investments.
Now they getting money.
Pretty motherfucker hoes love me.
So it's getting ugly.

We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

Eyes low, puffing on that kush, cuz' you never hydro.
Ride slow, rear view mirror, check the five-o.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

Well if it isn't Mr Fresh, nigga, best dressed.
Thumbing through a check.
Pretty nigga with the fresh press.

Ride slow, young syrup sipping nigga.
Rolling clean, been a trippy nigga since a youngin.
I was 17 rollin, rollin hella green, rollin caddie green.
Swollen, pocket sell the smallest sell the everything.
We getting throwed, my niggas gettin' hella dope.
Been a trippy nigga since a youngin.
I was sellin snow.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

Eyes low, puffing on that kush, cuz' you never hydro.
Ride slow, rear view mirror, check the five-o.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

Well if it isn't Mr Fresh, nigga, best dressed.
Thumbing through a check.
Pretty nigga with the fresh press.
We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.

We gettin' throwed, we gettin' throwed.
