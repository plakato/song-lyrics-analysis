I Want You Dead Lyrics
by The Undead.


I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
Yeah, girl it turned that I was a fool.
All those things they said about you were true.
I tried to do the best I could do.
Now I want to do away with you.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
Yeah, girl it turned that I was a fool.
All those things they said about you were true.
I tried to do the best I could do.
Now I want to do away with you.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
When you lay down to sleep.
You pray the lord your soul to keep.
But when you lay down to die.
Remember, all those times you made me cry.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
I want you dead.
