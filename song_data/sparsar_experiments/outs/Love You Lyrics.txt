Love You Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

Honey love you, honey little.
Honey funny sunny morning.
Love you more funny love in the skyline baby.
Ice-cream 'scuse me.
I've seen you looking good the other evening.

Oh, you dig it, had to smile just an hour or so.
we in love like I think we be?
It Ain't a long rhyme.
It took ages to think.
I think I love it in the water, baby....

Honey love you, honey little.
Honey funny sunny morning.
Love you more funny love in the skyline baby.
Ice-cream 'scuse me.
I've seen you looking good the other evening.

Flaking you are a nice little one.
To put it all around, it's just good.
I like it, hey hey hey.
S'pose some time that day.
We'll be swinging along over across to me.

Honey love you, honey little.
Honey funny sunny morning.
Love you more funny love in the skyline baby.
Ice-cream 'scuse me.
I've seen you looking good the other evening.

Goodtime rocker woman we'll stray our pieces.
Little creepy we shine so sleepy.
So whoopee!
That's how you look....

Honey love you, honey little.
Honey funny sunny morning.
Love you more funny love in the skyline baby.
Ice-cream 'scuse me.
I've seen you looking good the other evening.
