Water Resistant Lyrics
by Quillz.


Get money, My mind set/.
&amp; I'm a grind hard up until my last breathe/.
Keep the grass cut know how these haters get/.
Take everything from you &amp; leave nothing left/.
Damn this shit ridiculous, oh lord its ridiculous/.
Man these niggas really trying strip me for my chicken/.
No I'm not tripping, cause I know they out to get me/.
So I'm never slipping, water resistant/.

I'm up early in the morning when it's dark outside/.
&amp; I ain't off till again when it's dark outside/.
I barely sleep now days, I stay on my grind/.
Cause nobody gone do for I, better than i/.
Niggas say I'm mia yea money important absolutely/.
If you ain't grinding, you ain't understanding it fully/.
Chill don't pay the bills naw I'm never cooling/.
Having goals w/ no money can be very disturbing/.
I remember them days when I ain't have enough/.
To days when I felt like I had enough/.
I wish life wasn't so materialistic/.
But w/o it life would be ordinary as fuck/.
Looking outside, to the world thru the glass/.
Wondering how long will this window pain last/.
You telling me if I don't sin I don't have a chance/.
So in order to survive you got to live with regret.

They say may the past be the past, I try not to dwell/.
But my pops not being there had gave me have hell/.
Brother steady going in &amp; out of a cell/.
Life growing up felt like I was booked in jail/.
All alone all alone by my damn self/.
Made mistakes &amp; learn from them by my damn self/.
Taught myself to be a man by my damn self/.
I rise so I ride by my damn self/.
Passenger seat empty, Eye on the rear view/.
Death around the corner so I keep a tight circle/.
Long as you got money, somebody gone envy/.
So I always keep it light, In case it get heavy/.
Pay attention to the streets, though I'm not involved/.
Bullets don't have names &amp; niggas don't care at all/.
The root to all evil is what we want more of/.
Ain't nothing free in life no not at all so.
