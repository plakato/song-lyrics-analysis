My Adidas Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

D.M.C..
My Ahhh-didas, walk through concert doors.
And roam all over coliseum floors.
I stepped on stage, at Live Aid.
All the people gave, and the poor got paid.
And out of speakers I did speak.
I wore my sneakers but I'm not a sneak.
My Adidas touch the sand of a foreign land.
With mic in hand, I cold took command.
My Adidas and me close as can be.
We make a mean team, my Adidas and me.
We get around together, we down forever.
And we won't be mad when caught in bad weather.
My Adidas... my Adidas....
Yo, whassup?

Run.
My Ahhh-didas, standin on two fifth street.
Funky fresh and yes cold on my feet.
With no shoestring in 'em, I did not win 'em.
I bought 'em off the ave. with the black Lee denim.
I like to sport 'em, that's why I bought 'em.
A sucker tried to steal 'em so I caught 'em and I fought 'em.
And I walk down the street, and bop to the beat.
With Lee on my legs and Adidas on my feet.
And so now I'm just standin here shootin the gip.
Me and D and my Adidas standing on.
two fifth.
My Adidas... my Adidas....

D.M.C..

We like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings.
We slay all suckers who perpetrate.
And lay down law from state to state.
We travel on gravel, dirt road or street.
I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat.
On stage front page, every show I go.
It's Adidas on my feet, high top or low.
My Adidas... my Adidas....

Run.
Now the Adidas I possess for one man is rare.
Myself homeboy got 50 pair.
Got blue and black, cause I likes to chill.
And yellow and green when it's time to get ill.
Got a pair that I wear when I'm playin ball.
With the heel inside, make me 10 feet tall.

D.M.C..
My Adidas, only bring good news.
And they are not used as felon shoes.
They're black and white, white with black stripes.
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic.
On the strength of our famous university.
We took the beat from the street and put it on TV.
My Adidas are seen on the movie screen.
Hollywood knows we're good if you know what I mean.
We started in the  now we chill in.
And I won't trade my Adidas for no beat up Bally's.
My Adidas....
