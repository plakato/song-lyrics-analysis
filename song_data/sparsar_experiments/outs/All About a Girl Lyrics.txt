All About a Girl Lyrics
by Union J.

Refrain.
Whoa, whoa.

We fell in love so quickly.
Her smile lit up the city.
Just like a million lights.

Yeah, we burned out, we lost it.
Didn't know just what I wanted.
I wanna go back to that night.

Cause since that day.

I've been searching all my life for.

I've been all the way.

From Verona to California.
I've tried to find you.
You're my world.
Nobody told me that my life story.
Would be all about, be all about, be all about a girl.

It's all about a girl.

It's all about a girl.

It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl.

Every place I've been through.
I think that I see you.
New York, London, LA.
And every melody of.

Every song I sing true.
Always reminds me of you.
But still, I wanna press play.

I've been all the way.

I was waiting all my life for you.
I've been searching all the world for you.
Everything's reminded me of you.

From Verona to California.
I've tried to find you.
You're my world.
Nobody told me that my life story.
Would be all about, be all about, be all about a girl.
