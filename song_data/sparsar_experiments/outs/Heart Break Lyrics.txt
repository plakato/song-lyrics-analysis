Heart Break Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

Don't want another heart break.
Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.
Heart, Heart.
Heart, Heart break.
Heart, Heart break.
Don't want another heart break.
Don't want another heart break.
Heart, Heart break.

We used to be so cool oh.
I Would do anything for you oh.
When you would I call I come running.
I held you down while you're frontin.
Thought I was more than a woman to you.
How could you be so cruel.
It's supposed to be me and you.
Look what we've been through.
Now what am I goin do?
Since you don't love me the same.

Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.

Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.

Could it be that I'm a fool for you?
I'm surprised that I ain't see the truth.
When I hit you on a text, never text back.
Always chillin with your boys, never got that.
Ain't worried about it no more, don't stress that.
I'm movin on now, I'm sure I'm on the right track.
I'm finding that I gotta get away from you.
I rather walk alone, than stay and hurt with you.
Please don't call my phone.
Can't hurt me no more.
Cause I finally see that this is just another.

Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.

Heart break love.
Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
I don't want another heart break.

Don't want another heart break.
Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.
Heart, Heart.
Heart, Heart break.
Heart, Heart break.
Don't want another heart break.
Don't want another heart break.
Heart, Heart break.

Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Don't want another heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Heart break love.
Don't want another heart break.
Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.
Heart, Heart.
Heart, Heart break.
Heart, Heart break.
Don't want another heart break.
Don't want another heart break.
Heart, Heart break.
