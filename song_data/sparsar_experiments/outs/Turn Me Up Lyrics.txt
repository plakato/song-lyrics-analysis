Turn Me Up Lyrics
by 57 Pixels.


Testing; strike the side of my matchbox.
Smoke so much dank you won't believe it like Sasquatch.
I'd say it's my last shot, but that bottle's half empty.
It's awful how you see me, I ain't docile it's what-e-v.
S, this boggles up then secretes.
So powerful you can feel it wobble in the cement.
I held you while your tonsils left you bleedin'.
The way you act is like how brothels attract weak men.
Word, you make me a palegic, take me and my secrets.
And hate that I'm a demon.
For fuck's sake, I'm a route that is scenic.
Saw you when I got vilemic, I'm not trying to be comedic.
You're, rocky and I'm sea sick.
Stop me when I'm leavin', but watching all the same.
I'm, not me when I'm with you.
Cocky and I diss you, but watching all the same.

Yo, turn me up some.
Yo, turn me up some.
Yo, turn me up some.
Turn me up some, turn me up some.

Testing; spitting the same shit like backwash.
Weed so hairy you won't believe it like Sasquatch.
My heart's in a padlock, my lyrics on laptops.
My ability to rap it like a black on black backdrop.
Look, if the LC had a mascot, you know it would be me.
If anyone's in snapshots, you know it would be me.
There's parties in backyards, you know it would be me.
And a mind full of ramparts, you know it would be me.
Now, back to the real shit.
I'm not bitching man I'm just tired of having to deal with.
How much you hate my life an all of the trill shit.
I do, your words aren't working because this blunt still lit.
And my stomach won't burn enough rum.
I thought I figured it out but I'm still learning love from.
How I feel for you and my concern for young ones.
Just quiet down move that dial round and turn me up some.

Yo, turn me up some.
Yo, turn me up some.
Yo, turn me up some.
Turn me up some, turn me up some.
