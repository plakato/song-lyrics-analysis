Merlot Lies Lyrics
by XamVolo.


Fly to Japan.
Chill with Yakuza.
Run from the man.
With eyes like a dragon, they're.
All kinds of red.
From all kinds of purple.
I cease to mind.
I want this forever.

These diamonds.
Fill these oceans.
Ripping glass.
Into Lines.
Splitting silence.
That drowns commotion.
Drowns the potion.
Calls it wine.
Merlot lies.

Born in the stars.
Just round the corner.
Nobody cares.
We're all into circles now.
So over the moon.
And way past our bedtimes.
We're still alive.
We're like this forever.

These diamonds.
Fill these oceans.
Ripping glass.
Into Lines.
Splitting silence.
That drowns commotion.
Drowns the potion.
Calls it wine.
Merlot lies.

I didn't mean its.
'Cos that's what you wanted to hear.
Cyanide dreams, brace your.
Mind for the rest of your years.
I like to move.
I like to move.
Messed up my shoes, now they're.
Like this forever.

These diamonds.
Fill these oceans.
Ripping glass.
Into Lines.
Splitting silence.
That drowns commotion.
Drowns the potion.
Calls it wine.
Merlot lies.

We spoke of a million things.
We toasted a million drinks.
A toast to a million sins.
A toast to her billionth birthday.
Alive in the worst way.
Was she alive in the first place.
Slowly dying, grinding for:.

Those diamonds.
Those oceans.
That glass.
These Lines.
That silence.
That drowns commotion.
Drowns the potion.
Calls it wine.
Merlot lies.
