Boarding Lyrics
by Womanly Hips.

Womanly Hips, here today on some real gangsta shit.

I tear up fresh tracks.
On brand new wax.
Everyone here's got lots of money.
All around me I'm seeing stacks.
Never seems to happen to me in fact.
I'm headed straight to the bottom.
But I'll still make it intact.

I'll be getting way high up over trees.
Headed straight to the sky.
While I'm there, I'll fuck up a trick on the side.
You know me, I stay up after dark.
Still be hitting pipe after pipe in the park.
Smashing boxes, always leaving my mark.
And no one sees my face cause I'm wearing a mask.
Moving a whole lot of white,.
yeah its so awesome.
Quick to spray on a homie like yo watch it.
Riding these curves, 'sall fun.
no boring.
I missed my plane already.
That means it's no boarding.

That means it's snowboarding motherfucker! Cause that's what we do!
Alright check it out.

My life's not about the money, I'm not a fan.
As long as I got enough for this goggle tan.
A new board every couple of seasons.

Never cease it, when its snowing that means I'm never sleeping.
I gotta be fit, find people to be with.
Cause I think I found the happiness secret.
Riding down the mountain on my board yeah I need it.
