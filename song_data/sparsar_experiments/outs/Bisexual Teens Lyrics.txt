Bisexual Teens Lyrics
by Sway.


1 - 2 - 3 - 4.

Aaw.

I met them on a New York plane.
Beth and Donna were their names.
They offered me no chances to forget.
I left my girlfriend that same day.
I never liked her anyway.
Besides these girls had made me their pet.

Oh-o-ooh.

They were bisexual.
I'm an open minded guy.
I let them play me like a violin.
'till I arrived.

Like cats in heat.
Won't miss a beat.
They knew just what to do.
They taught me all the moves.
And all the right positions too.

Interesting pornography.
That is what they were to me.
Their love was such as I had not seen.

Oh.
They fucked each other upside down.
With tools I've never seen around.
Do you comprehend what I mean.

Oooh-oh-ha-ho.

I have had lots of kicks.
Had houndreds.
But none quite like this.
Like playing games.
With warheads nuclear powered.
Hit or miss.

They were so full of life.
So beautiful in every way.
If it was up to me.
I'd have'em every single day.

Mmm.

And the lights from the grimy signs.
Flickers pathetically towards the evening sky.
Like saved souls.
On their way to heaven.
As they quickly pass you by.

Or damned once being heightened.
By their sense of asking.
Why wasn't I chosen.
For that glorious place.
Where all them angels go to die.

And I say hey girl.
It's not easy.

Oh.

To be yourself.
But it works.
I think.

Just let the western city.
Shine its special light on you.
And you'll be fine.

Just let the western city.
Shine its special light on you.
And you'll be fine.

And don't ever let them hold you down.
No, don't ever let them hold you down.
No baby listen.
Don't ever let them hold you down.

Never let them hold you down.
