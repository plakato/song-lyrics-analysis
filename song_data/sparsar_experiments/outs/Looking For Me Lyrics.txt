Looking For Me Lyrics
by Zip K..


Neck neck neck.
Wrist wrist wrist.
Money money money.
In my fist fist fist.
Weak head game will get a bitch dismissed.
When you in another lane you know the shit gets switched.
Runnin East Atlanta with some slick misfits.
They might put ya whole noggin on a Christmas list.
When u come from broke niggas learn to fix shit quicker.

I know you been lookin for me.
I know you been lookin for me.
Tell um that you found me in the trenches.
Hidden by the biggest booty bitches.
Tell I'm I been livin in the ignorance.
Tell um when it's bout the shits I'm with it.
I know they been lookin for me.

Neck neck neck.
Wrist wrist wrist.
Red bone booty in my fist fist fist.
Fish &amp; grits on my kitchen dish.
Till my nigga nigga nigga nigga niggas rich.
Aye.
I knew niggas had the choppas.
On um.
I fuck around and went to college on um.
Tryna drops some knowledge on um.
Tryna cop the drop top low mileage on it.
Talk her out her crop top break her down chop shop.
6 o clock Cop top.
Bitch I'm countin on it.
You a couple minutes late but it's okay.
Cause.
