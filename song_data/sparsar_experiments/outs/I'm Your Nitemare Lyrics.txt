I'm Your Nitemare Lyrics
by 666.


\-, How do I get here to sleep 
\-? Can you hear me I'm comin' ... 
\-? Where am I 
\-? Where do you think you are 
\- In Bed? Please, let me sleep. 
\-, Beware cause I'm your nitemare, 
Spoken 
You know it's midnite and the evil appears in the dark. 
You try to sleep to scream ... 
But. My terror takes your breath. Befor you'll make it 
I'm the prince of darkness, 
The mighty force that keeps your dreams away. 
And. Now you fight to stay awake, 
There's, no light, no way. 
Nowhere left to run 
And. I promise 
I'm, the creature you'll see every night. 
That almost stops your heart 
\-. Why me 
\- cause I'm your nitemare
