Bob dylan blues - 2010 remastered version Lyrics
by Syd Barrett.

Got the Bob Dylan blues.
And the Bob Dylan Shoes.
And my clothes and my hair's in a mess.
But you know I just couldn't care less.
Goin' to write me a song.
Bout' what's right and what's wrong.
Bout' god and my god and all that.
Quiet while I make like a cat.

Cause I'm a poet.
Don't ya know it.
And the wind, you can blow it.
Cause I'm Mr. Dylan, the king.
And I'm free as a bird on the wing.
Roam from town to town.
Guess I get people down.
But I don't care too much about that.
Cause my gut and my wallet are fat.
Make a whole lotta dough.
But I deserve it though.
I've got soul and a good heart of gold.
So I'll sing about war in the cold.

Well I sing about dreams.
And I rhymes it with seems.
Cause it seems that my dream always means.
That I can prophesy all kinds of things.
Well the guy that digs me.
Should try hard to see.
That he buys all my discs and a hat.
And when I'm in town go see that.
