A Moment Forever Lyrics
by Volbeat.

Keep it up my baby, don't go, don't leave it on top.
Keep it up my baby, don't go, don't do it on top.
Keep it on my baby, so come up here on top.
Keep it up my baby, don't go, don't leave it on top.

Yeah!

See all livers walk hand in hand in the park.
And hide all the action.
One couple frozen and bondage forever more.
With chains around ankles.
Standing like statues, so lucky to see them here.
And feeling their presence.
Their love for each other was taken away by force.
For ages and ages.

Be silent wherever they go.
Cause their moment's forever.
Be silent wherever they dance.

Their story goes on that they're moving away.
By thoughts from city to city.
Showing that love can't be killed even after dark and after death.
Dancing with shadows so lucky to see them here.
And feeling their presence.
The chain around my ankles is rattling their mellow song.
Forever and ever.

Be silent wherever they go.
Cause their moment's forever.
Be silent wherever they dance.
A bow for the couple that shows.
That their moment's forever.
Be silent wherever they dance.

Keep it up my baby, don't go, don't leave it on top.
Keep it up my baby, don't go, don't do it on top.
Keep it on my baby, so come up here on top.
Keep it up my baby, don't go, don't leave it on top.

Be silent wherever they go.
Cause their moment's forever.
Be silent whenever they dance.
A bow for the couple that shows.
That their moment's forever.
Be silent wherever they dance.
