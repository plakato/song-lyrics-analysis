Not ready to say goodbye - piano version Lyrics
by Awa.

Got this bag, sitting at the door.
I guess I should've seen it coming on before.
So selfish, too dumb, just young and in love.
Now the only thing I ever wanted.
It's about to run.
What have I done?!

Oh, I wish that we could start again.
I can't believe we're at the end.
Cause boy, I'm not ready to say goodbye.
I never meant to break your heart.
I'd do anything to make it right.
Cause boy, I'm not ready to say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Cause boy, I'm not ready to say goodbye.

I think about the first time that we kissed.
I told myself that it doesn't get better than this.

But now that you're gone.
Baby, my heart can't go on!
I'd do anything to save us.
I'd do anything to call but.

Oh, I wish that we could start again.
I can't believe we're at the end.
Cause boy, I'm not ready to say goodbye.
I never meant to break your heart.
I'd do anything to make it right.
Cause boy, I'm not ready to say goodbye.

I swear if you leave i go out of my mind.
My heart won't just live without you in my life.
So, don't say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.

Oh, I wish that we could start again.
I can't believe we're at the end.
Cause boy, I'm not ready to say goodbye.
I never meant to break your heart.
I'd do anything to make it right.
Cause boy, I'm not ready to say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Cause boy, I'm not ready to say goodbye.
