Don't Haunt This Place Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Don't haunt this heart.
Don't haunt this place.
Your heart beating slow as it beats out of pace.
West side apartment grows lonely and dark.
West side apartment is two more empty hearts.

I see your keys hanging in the same place.
They haven't moved for a month or even a day.
This was hard it was fun.
We should do it again.
Give ourselves some time.
Ten years from the day.

I need you now.
I need you then.
I never want to feel this again.
Separate the room with painful divides.
Until there's nothing left to remind.

Never want to see you again.
I never want to feel this again.
Turn off the locks.
All the pitfalls night.
'Till I find something you left behind.

And the things we never had.
And the things we wish would come back.
Because we need this oh so bad.
Because we need this oh so bad.

And we tremble in the night.
For the things we're wishing were right.
Because we need this oh so bad.
Because I need you oh so bad.

Don't haunt this heart.
Don't haunt this place.
Your heart beating slow as it beats out of pace.
West side apartment grows lonely and dark.
West side apartment is two more empty hearts.

I want to hurt.
I want to betray.
It's not like me to make your heart break.
This was hard it was fun we should do it again.
Give ourselves some time ten years from the day.

And the things we never had.
And the things we wish would come back.
Because we need this oh so bad.
Because we need this oh so bad.

And we tremble in the night.
For the things we're wishing were right.
Because we need this oh so bad.
Because I need you oh so bad.

Don't haunt this heart.
Don't haunt this place.
Your heart beating slow as it beats out of pace.
West side apartment grows lonely and dark.
West side apartment is two more empty hearts.

I know it's right I know it's okay.
And I'd like to see you now and again.
This was hard it was dumb we should do it again.
Give ourselves some time ten years from the day.
