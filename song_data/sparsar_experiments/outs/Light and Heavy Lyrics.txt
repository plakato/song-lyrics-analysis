Light and Heavy Lyrics
by Switchfoot.


I'm on a roll.
I'm feeling Icarus.
I might have flown too high.
I'm not alone.
I'm feeling Icarus.
I might have flown too high.

Adriana, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for.
Adriana, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for.

Pick up the phone.
Please tell me anything.
You might have flown too high.
My bird has flown.
Please tell me anything.
You might have flown too high.

Adriana, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for.
Adriana, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for.

On my pilgrimage, I'm traveling light with the heavy heart.
On my pilgrimage, I'm traveling light and heavy, light and heavy, light and.
heavy.
This is your torch to carry.
More than just a corpse to bury down.
None of us are ordinary.
A beating heart is light and heavy.

Adriana, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for.
Adriana, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for.

Light and heavy.
