Midriff Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


A warm nite, some cold drinks.
The flow tight, zone slight.
The patron stings.
It may not be realistically true.
But i'm feelin' like.
I'm the hottest mothaf*cka in the vicinity breathin'.
Runnin' 'round this thing from wall to wall.
Shorty to shorty, lady to lady.
Planting my seeds, earnin' they beams.
Don't try to contain me.
I'm feelin' myself, i'm all in my lust.
&amp; if she with it.
If we're takin' a pic, i'm palmin' her butt.
I'm gravitating toward this tall drink of water.
Toned navel, hat floppy.
Tryna figure out from here if her head sloppy.
I eventually engage her, i tell her i can be her rock.
I just gotta put you all up on to me.
No matter the cost.
I can't pinpoint what's got me so indiscreet.
Maybe it's that sideboob swangin' in the summer breeze.
Whatever it is, i admit it.
You got me in your back pocket.
But i'm just tryna know if i can lick this cookie butter off you.
I'm throwed.

Come on, come on.
Get up, get up.
Tell me, tell me.
Baby, do you wanna ride?

Come on, come on.
Get up, get up.
Tell me, for real.
Shawty, can you feel the vibe?

I get amnesia when i'm in your features.
I go missing when your stomach glisten.
I'm so focused when it's poking.
When you're in a skirt &amp; tights.
And i can still barely see it folding.
When it's buried in harem pants &amp; it's still potent.
I'm tryna grope it, no point withholdin'.
I'd love to be strokin' them golden.
Long spider legs you been totin'.
She got awful grammar, but i still wanna ram her.
Materialistic &amp; pretentious, but i'd still give her the inches.
She's stuck up, but it kinda turns me on so it's fine.
She roots for the clippers and still i wanna feel her weight on mine.
I got this urge to drown in her thighs.
I bet that backside smackin'.
Like a sonic malt shake &amp; some fries.
See i'm trippin'.
I never feel quite myself when i'm 'round her.
If anything, that sundress bump just get rounder.
Mad shallow with an illogical waist.
She could treat me like beaters and i still couldn't be phased.
I admit it, you could have me in the palm of your hand.
And all you gotta do is show a little skin.
My my, shorty you lookin' fly.
If you ain't busy later tonite.
Then neither am i.
I'm so throwed.

You got me so mothaf*ckin thrower.
And i don't what to do, but ay, for real.
If you keep shakin' that tail.
I might pounce on you.

Come on, come on.
Get up, get up.
Tell me, tell me.
Baby, do you wanna ride?

Come on, come on.
Get up, get up.
Tell me, for real.
Shawty, can you feel the vibe?
