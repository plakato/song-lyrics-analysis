Girls Just Wanna Lyrics
by 69 Boyz.


Girls we wan na 
We wan na wan na 
We wan na have fun have fun 
Girls girls. We need to have fun fun. 
Girls girls lets have fun fun, fun, fun, 
Lets, have fun fun, 
 
It's the weekend 
Time for meeting 
All. My dogs will go creeping 
Spending dub after dub 
I'm wide awake in the club; 
With, no love for the hatas 
In, the V.I.P. that hate us 
In, the mix huffing and puffing 
Well. All of that don't mean nothing. 
No bluffing we whilling go carry on to criss styling 
All night. We laughing and smiling 
Silk suites and gators. We styling 
So sweet just like a pamper 
Putting musical hits down for Tampa 
From Washington to Atlanta 
From Havannah to Savannah 
Please can have a little fun 
Hit. The floor, we shake a little butt 
With. My left leg down my right leg up, 
Tilt my head back then finish the cup huh 
Nigga. What nigga? What 
Lie and direct me I'm the one 
And. The reason we come is to have a little fun. Cuz 
 
Girls we wan na 
We wan na have fun have fun 
Girls. We need to have fun fun. 
Girls lets have fun fun. 
Girls, with my girls, girls, we wan na 
I'm gon na have fun have fun 
Girls. I need to go out out. 
Girls give it up one time time: 
Girls girls, girl, girl, 
 
Shorty. Why don't you and your friends 
Take a little trip with me in my Benz 
You ain't, a brotha thrill from the coat 
Your girl in the back? Far from your boat 
Chilling up in my S-T-L 
Go get me room in the T-E-L 
Lock it down like a C-E-L 
So. I can waive your B-E-L 
Huh go and turn it down. 
You know what them 69 Boyz about. 
We, don't play no mood, no funk 
And. I bet we can make you shake yo rump 
Fun. If you want it, come get it 
And. If you see admit it 
Girl you can hit and split it. 
Just go play, wit, it aow, 
 
Girls. We wan na 
We wan na have fun 
Girls. We need to have fun. 
Girls lets have fun 
Girls. With my girls, we wan na we wan na 
I'm gon na have fun. I'M gon na have fun 
Girls with my girls. 
I need to go out with my girls, my girls 
Give it up one time. For my girls, 
 
We all into the mix roaming 
Strolling just roll it 
Benjamins, we hold it 
With, a gold, thirty spokes rolex 
I'm, folding them papers, 
Disolve into vapors. 
I got a trunk full of papers. 
With a gangsta to wake up. The neighbors 
I'll make ya, get down 
All the way to the ground, 
From Canada to Cancoun 
Back across the late line, a doom 
Boom coming out ya speakers, 
I'm breaking you like a beepa, 
Close, ya, eyes and I'll creep ya, 
Hit, the Marriot and I'll freak ya. 
Like Heavy-D and Monifah 
Big time, just like Latifah 
Guaranteed to make ya get weaker 
Like a boom. The bass is gon na keep ya. 
And beat ya like Tyson 
If. You don't believe me go ice. It 
All the bills. We sike em 
So high, like Toni Braxton 
If, you wan na get with this action. 
Show em off like Michael Jackson, 
Or sream, like Janet 
So funkdafied. You can't stand it 
Huh nigga. What nigga? What 
Lie and direct me I'm the one 
And. The reason we come is to have a little fun cuz 
, 
Girls girls. We wan na we wan na 
We wan na have fun have fun 
Girls girls. We need to have fun fun. 
Girls girls lets have fun, have fun 
Girls girls, with my girls, girls,

Girls girls. I need to go out
