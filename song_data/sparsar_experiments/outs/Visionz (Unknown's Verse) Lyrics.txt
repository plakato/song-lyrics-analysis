Visionz (Unknown's Verse) Lyrics
by UnknownProductions.

Too much to comprehend.
By the time I understand.
My life Is at it's end.
Some people never figure it out.
That's why I be trusting word of mouth.
No matter how absurd it sounds.
It could be the truth.
Your mind will feel like boxing ring.
Hidden behind the eyes and soul.
Of a human being being despised.
And told lies.
I'm a soldier got blood on my face.
Imma get exposure.
I explore thoughts like I'm a mind rover.
So when the cop tells you to pullover.
Don't do it say screw it foot on the pedal.
And act like your used to it.
And like you normally do it.
A deformed soul in a pit of monsters.
Would say It doesn't matter.
Just more energy to Saturn.
Remember life's a pattern.
It's not all about what you earn.
Learn.
