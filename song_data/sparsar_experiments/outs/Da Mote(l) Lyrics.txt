Outside, a dance club., The Tootsee Roll beat is boomin' inside. 
MAN. What'S up baby, They done had that last call for alcohol and 
Everything. What'S up, you gon' come back to the'mote with me or what

MAN, Hey! You can bring your friends if you want. I got my boys back at 
The hotel .... So what you gon' do?

Uh Uh Ahh baby. Here we go now: 
 
, Thrill, Pa Dlaya, 
Hey baby doll. What'S up ?'Scuse the mood, I'm a lil' bit bored 
And? Normally, I don't try to take girls home after the club 
But. You got that flavor ride and I'm kinda hungry 
Not only that strictly by myself, sometimes I tend to get lonely 
So. Let'S find this camp and get a lil' something to eat, 
Get back to the'mote and kick off them shoes. So I can rub them feet. 
And. We both dogs baby, so we ain't got to joke 
If, you're down I'll get to the car and we can head to the'mote 
 
 {, Let's go to the motel, let's go to the'mote 
I won't tell if you don't tell } 
Jay-Ski 
 {. Let'S go to the motel } Girl. Don'T have no shame 
 {! I won't tell if you don't tell } How you'll be gettin' that pocket 
Change 
 {. Let'S go to the motel } Girl. You know the deal 
 {. I won't tell if you don't tell } How you'll be payin', that phone bill 

It's the last call for alcohol baby. So, let's leave the club 
I wan na get in the tub and rub-a-dub cause, I'm in the mood for lo-ove ... 
You wanted barbecue or mildew girl. So what you wan na do 
We can go to the Hilton Motel 6 or get a room at the Peek-A-Boo uh 
So eat your Wheaties sweetie and yo. You can best believe 
Bring your toothbrush, a fresh pair of panties yo and that's all you need 
So. Let'S keep it a G, thang uhh and please don't go, tell 
That you're makin' noise with the 69 Boyz. So let's go to the motel uhh

 {. I won't tell if you don't tell } How you'll be gettin' them. Braids done, 
 {, Let's go to the motel } Girl. Don'T try to shine! 
 {! I won't tell if you don't tell } Where you workin' part time:

Don't holler'bout. I don't know ya and you don't know me 
Cause. If your booty, big, then I'ma learn to dig your personality,
