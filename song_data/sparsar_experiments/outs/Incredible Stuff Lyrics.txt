Incredible Stuff Lyrics
by Rushad Eggleston.

I think the world's got enough incredible stuff in it.
So I don't want to add to the clutter and the mess of it.
I'll just dance around.
And act like a clown.
And maybe you could use a little fool in your life...?

Itchy people of the world got every kind of scratching tool.
So it'd probably be better if I just went back to school.
I could learn some things about marketing.
And maybe I could get into a place where you could.
Find me in the isles of a long lost store.
Take me like a pill and I'll tell you what for.
Cuz maybe you could use a little break.
From all your scratching.

Eeku eeku garlog, barsnog harzog!
Eeku eeku garlog, barsnog harzog!
Ickty gickty garlog, bikity bickity bungtabee.
