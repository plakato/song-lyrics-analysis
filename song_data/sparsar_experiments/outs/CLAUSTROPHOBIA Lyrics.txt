CLAUSTROPHOBIA Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Cold coffee.
Drive slow.
Watch the houses disappear row by row.
Head hurts.
Sweatshirts.

Cold sweat.
Gets old.
Want the serotonin to come home.
Wake up, no luck.
Telling time by lines of beer in my cup.

Take away all my fun.
You know you can tie a noose around my tongue.
The man at the wheel driving.
My mind is drunk.
The focus is gone.

Claustrophobia.
The walls are slowly closing in.
This town has a hold of us.
The claws are tearing at my skin.
Now my conscience is leaving.
The words are for speaking.
There's no one to speak them to.
Claustrophobia.
The walls are slowly closing in.

Matchbox, padlocks.
In the shopping bag 'cross the parking lot.
Small clouds, leave mouth.
See the shadow stretching till the light runs out.

Take away all my fun.
You know you can tie a noose around my tongue.
The man at the wheel driving.
My mind is drunk.
The focus is gone.
The focus is gone.

Claustrophobia.
The walls are slowly closing in.
This town has a hold of us.
The claws are tearing at my skin.
Now my conscious is leaving.
The words are for speaking.
There's no one to speak them to.
Claustrophobia.
The walls are slowly closing in.

I always hoped that you could just stay dead.
Radioactive in your crown of lead.
Deep underneath the pillars of this bed.
Yeah I always hoped that you would just stay dead.

Claustrophobia.
The walls are slowly closing in.
This town has a hold of us.
The claws are tearing at my skin.
Now my conscious is leaving.
The words are for speaking.
There's no one to speak them to.
Claustrophobia.
The walls are slowly closing in.
