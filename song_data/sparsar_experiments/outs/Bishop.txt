Bishop
by Xiu Xiu.

This blue dot of sickly light.
That is daytime in your embarassed town.
Burns a hole in the fading yellow ribbon.
On your fading wine colored Cavalier.
The mine has fallen down on you.
As you dug a well of death.
Milk and sugar water.
In brief sympathy with them.
When we see the hate in your eyes.
It doesn't make us better men.
The mine has crushed your brother.
As he ruined our rotting sky.
A white hot blast of black hot powder.
And you lapse into a real boy.
The mine has fallen down on you.
As you dug a well of death.
Tears and sugar water flow.
In briefest sympathy with them.

Should you be ashamed for more than that.
Than that your daddy raped you silly?
Leaning my head on the refrigerator.
Crying for the stupid world we share.
Walla Walla Walla Walla Walla Walla Hey.
Walla Walla Walla Walla Hey Hey.
Walla Walla Walla Walla Walla Walla Hey.
Walla Walla Hey Hey Hey.
Walla Walla Walla Walla Walla Walla Hey.
Walla Walla Hey Hey Hey.
Walla Walla Hey.
Walla Walla Hey.
Hey Hey Hey HEY.
