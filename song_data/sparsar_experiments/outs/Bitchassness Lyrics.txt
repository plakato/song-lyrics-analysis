Bitchassness Lyrics
by Swifty McVay.

They never love you nigga 

It was some niggas from Iron Fist, 
That dissed us on a track 
And. When I called them. 
You woulda thought them. Niggas do Christian rap 
Now. This is fact 
Remember Dirty Harry signed
you 
On a dotted line 
And when he died. You was crying dude 
Ya took advantage of his heart 
Be, mindful 
You walked in this bitch 
Blindfolded and now behind closed 
Doors. What the fuck you cared about, we chasing whores 
And, he's Proof established his life and tried to give you yours, 
Y'all, niggas ain't, even sork shit. You ain't here to brother 
When, he talked when Em were near. It came out. The other 
And on tour. Y'All was humble, as some puppies 
You didn't know, rap some hood flunkies that got lucky 
And. All the fuck you ever was good. Fo' was hitting hoes 
That's the winner's attention. It wasn't genuine known 
One of you, niggas hated on Dolo, you bastard fuck 
The other tried to sue Proof. They wouldn't give his masses up 
But. You gon', take it to Shady and try to ask for bucks 
That's why the too lureless niggas got they asses up. 
Outta there G-Flame and Famous yeah. They knew the game 
On why the mug this they try to gain fame off his name. 
Claiming y'all been doing this for Proof. 
But ain't, nothing changed 
And! Now you argue with his wife 
About the kids' estate 
I knew it was something strange 
But. I can say that I'm positive, that 
Big homie is spinning in his grave 
You bitches 
 
There's. Only one type of nigga 
That'll do the shit that you did 
And. That'S a bitch, That's a bitch 
And! That'S a bitch bitchassness 
There's! Only one type of nigga 
That'll take from a dead man's kids 
And. That'S a bitch! That'S a bitch 
And! That'S a bitch bitchassness!
