Oh man, I got the plan that could soberize a drunken man.
You don't fucks with me? Close your eyes and fuck a fan.
A custom brand a poker man wit a lucky hand.
Boy its 21 so you could overstand or understand.
Either way im the Victor Cruz, I lit the fuse.
On yall sleeping this the reminder after you hit the snooze.
So ILL, I'll have the league questioning me.
I ain't on roids, bet the commissioner would defend me.
Ndomahkong Suh rappers after the plays over.
Kevin Garnett, block you after the plays over.
I don't want yall to think that you have a chance against me.
There is a better chance of Scalabrine winning ESPYs.
That's like snow showers in the Philippines.
Or Steve Young quarterbacking Philip rivers team in 2012.
No, that's not happe-fucki-ning.
Tryna take a money shower and a bath in luxury.
Bath in luxury?
I don't rock with wanna bes I know what I wanna be.
You call me a gonna-be.
Such a breeze eatin Black Eyed Peas.
Thinkin like, what, IMA BE, IMA bE?
I been at this shit my whole life, tryna get this dough twice.
Unforgivable whips I be in theVaan with Bovice.
Yo go left, theres a toll right?
A-z tryna ez pass the police.
They snappin pics.
Of the license plate.
I mean we could pay in coins but I don't like the wait.
And we chiefin L's.
Yo ask the cashier how the reefer smells, light.
Get em up, get em up what.
Get em up, get em up what.
Get em up, get em up what.
Get em up, get em up what.
