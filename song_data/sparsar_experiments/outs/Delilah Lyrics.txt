Delilah Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


Cut you off 
You know I got ta cut you off girl. 
You know I got ta 
Baby. I got ta 
, 
Delilah 
Baby. You got that fire 
Answer to my desires. 
Baby, you take me higher 
But. I know you a liar Delilah 
Delilah 
Sent, to me from Messiah 
Answer to my desires. 
Baby, you take me higher 
But. I know you a liar Delilah, 
, 
Stolen morals, 
I'm baptized swimming in your Holy Water 
It feels so good stays on my mind like Georgia, 
I'm Ray Charles when you take them thangs off, I'm so loyal, 
I'm lusting for your flesh. 
I want your mouth, your ass! Your breasts 
Anything, you ask me I'll, say yes, 
I'm singing you the fucking best 
Baby, I'm so obsessed, 
 
I got ta cut you off 
You know I got ta cut you off girl 
Baby. I got ta cut you off 
Just. When I try to cut you off 
Damn your body, so soft got me saying-, 
 
You, you make me weak 
Girl. I can't eat girl. I can't sleep, 
Can't think can't breathe 
This. Just ain't me 
This just can't be 
Fucked. My bread up. You really fucked. My head up 
Just when I think I'm fed up. We go and fuck the bed up 
And by the time I get up my whole stomach, wet up, 
I, don't know how to let up
