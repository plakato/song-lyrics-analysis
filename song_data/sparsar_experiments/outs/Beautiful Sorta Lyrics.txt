Beautiful Sorta Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

All I wanna do is get up, is get up, is get up.
In the morning, in the morning.
And not wanna die.

I feel alright when I think about you.
Walking through a star field covered in lights.
Wasted like you're losing your job you're so fired.
We're just like the ones we used to make fun of.

It's beautiful sorta, beautiful sorta.
Beautiful sorta, but not.
Beautiful sorta, beautiful sorta.
Beautiful sorta, but not.

All I wanna do is get down, is get down, is get down.
In the evening, in the evening.
And not wanna die.
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

I'm buzzing like a jar full of lightning bugs.
Walking through a star field covered in lights.
Wasted like a bum with somebody's wallet.
Pictures inside of you and me, you and I.
So past sad I'm crazy and scary.

It's Beautiful Sorta, Beautiful Sorta.
Beautiful Sorta, but not.
Beautiful Sorta, Beautiful Sorta.
Beautiful Sorta, but not.

I do everything I can to remove you but it hurts.
From all the things that we started.

It's Beautiful Sorta, Beautiful Sorta.
Beautiful Sorta, but not.
Beautiful Sorta, Beautiful Sorta.
Beautiful Sorta, but not.
Beautiful Sorta, Beautiful Sorta.
Beautiful Sorta, but not.
Beautiful Sorta, Beautiful Sorta.
Beautiful Sorta, but not.
Beautiful Sorta, Beautiful Sorta.
Beautiful Sorta, but not.
