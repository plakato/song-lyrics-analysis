It's Going Down (feat. Parle) Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


Yaaahoooooooooooooooo.
Ooo yeah.

I've been waiting.
Spend my time chasing.
For your love.
And it's going down tonight.

I've been waiting.
Spend my time chasing.
For your love.
And it's going down tonight.

What did you think you would do?
What did you think you'd say?
After I told you how I was feeling.
Never thought I'd see this day.
I always kept dreaming.
Never let failure hurt my heart.
I knew that you would soon see better.
All I could do is hope and say.
Is there a chance or possibility.
That I could get close to you?
I want to get romantic with you.
Do all the things that lovers do.
Finally all the things that I've done.
To get the chance to be with you.
It was sure 'nuff worth the wait.
Tonight I'll be wrapped up in your arms.

I always kept wishing.
I always kept praying.
Good things come to those who wait.
That's what momma always said.
Baby that phrase stuck in my head.
There's nothing I won't do.
To please you.
Given the chance, I'll do you right.
Even inside I have to know.
Is there a chance or a possibility.
That I could get close to you?
I want to get romantic with you.
Do all the things that lovers do.
Finally all the things that I've done.
To get the chance to be with you.
I guess it was sure 'nuff worth the wait.
Tonight I'll be wrapped up in your arms.

Oooh.
Oh yeah.
Ooooh yeah.
Hey.
Baby.
Oooooooooooooo.
Oooh yeah.
Ride or Die.
Walk on by.
Oh yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
Heeeey.
