Spank jail Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Yesterday she tried to kill herself.
And today she's a little bit under the weather.
Now do you have any idea.
Just how bad you were being?

Hold me down.
Five years after the fact.
Coppin' out.
Want no part of that, locked.

She'll be a cop, she'll be a cop.
When she gets old enough she's gonna be.
Shoot me a cop, shoot me a cop.
When she gets salty, now she's gonna be.

You've been so bad.
Gonna take you to spank jail.
Why do bad things happen to good people.
If there aren't any.
Oh, you brought this on yourself.

Hold me down.
Five years after the fact.
Coppin' out.
Want no part of that.

Locked.
Locked this on yourself.
