Point Nine Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

I've only known you.
Nine tenths of a percent of my life.
And you've only known me for.
Point eight of yours but.
There's something in the way we kiss that.
Keeps me assured.

I have no expectations for the future.
The present's too perfect to think about that.
Sometimes I wonder if I should slow down.
Make sure my heart stays intact.

But I trust you.
Because it feels.
Like I can.
And I can't worry.
About anything.
While you're holding my hand.

I can't keep.
My heart from beating.
Twice as fast as it.
Normally would.
Because even if.
I wanted to stop it I don't.
Think that I could.

Don't think that I could.
And why would I want to?
You've always felt so good.
