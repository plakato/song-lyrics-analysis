Cold Gin (Live) Lyrics
by Ace Frehley.

My heat is broke and I'm so tired.
I need some fuel to build a fire.
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah.
The landlord's gone and I'm done and out.
I'm done and out.
Ooh, it's cold gin time again.
You know it'll always win.
It's cold gin time again.
You know it's the only thing.
That keeps us together.
It's time to leave and get another quart.
Around the corner at the liquor store.
Cheapest stuff is uh all I need.
To get me back on my feet again.
Back on my feet again.
Ooh, it's cold gin time again.
It's cold gin time again.
You know it's the only thing.
That keeps us together.
Ooh, it's cold gin time again.
You know it'll always win.
It's cold gin time again.
You know it's the only thing.
That keeps us together.
Keeps us together.
That keeps us together.
That keeps us together.
That keeps us together.
Cold gin time again.
