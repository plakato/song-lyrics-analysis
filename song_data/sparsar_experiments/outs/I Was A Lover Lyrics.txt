I Was A Lover Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

I bought a track jacket, some running shoes.
I had no pockets so I had nothing to lose.
Took a run from all my winter blues.
Till it was summer.

And every culdesac and avenue.
Tried to turn my back then my ambitions grew.
It reminded me of the feelings i once knew.
When I was a love.

Oooh, la da da da.
If we were lovers, if we were lovers.

I started feelin' bad, I thought of you.
All the plans you have are always fallin' through.
You really need someone you can run to.
To be your cover.

I really hope I change, I'll come back then.
Maybe we'll try this all over again.
Till then I'll wonder how it could've been.
If we were lovers.

Oooh, la da da da.
If we were lovers, if we were lovers.
Oooh, la da da da.
If we were lovers, if we were lovers.

There is a time, everything will find it's place in line.
But all my dreams get in the way.
There is a time, everything will find it's place in line.
But all my dreams get in the way.

Put on my track jacket, those running shoes.
I've got no pockets so I've got nothing to lose.
I'm gonna run from all my winter blues.
Until we're overs.

Oooh, la da da da.
If we were lovers, if we were lovers.
Oooh, la da da da.
If we were lovers, if we were lovers.
