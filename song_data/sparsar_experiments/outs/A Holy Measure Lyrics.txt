A Holy Measure Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

He says, Come, come let us reason together.
The stone the builders rejected.
By number, weight and measure.
He says come.
Lord Jesus lone keeper of the law.
I am with Him in the garden.
He is, He is, He is, He, yeah.
To the proud heart hardened.
Who is among us to step off? so step off.
To the tall shepherd, He is given name.
Oh, beat the drum for Him, a holy measure.
Strum and buzz for him, our only treasure.
Lord Jesus lone keeper of the law.
I am with Him in the garden.
He is, He is, He is, He, yeah.
To the proud heart hardened.
Hail, hail, hail.
The high King of Heaven.
Christ Jesus ruler of all.
Lord Jesus lone keeper of the law.
I am with Him in the garden.
He is, He is, He is, He, yeah.
To the proud heart hardened.
Hail, hail, hail.
The high King of Heaven.
Christ Jesus ruler of all.
By Him, for Him.
Through Him.
Everything all.
