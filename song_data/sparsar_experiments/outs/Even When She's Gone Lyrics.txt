Even When She's Gone Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


There's a lipstick kiss on the rim of a Starbucks's coffee cup.
I can smell Channel mademoiselle on the pillowcase when I'm waking up.
She's here but she ain't when she leaves she stays undercover all over the.
place.

And I.
I've never seen nothing like her in my life.
She's got the gift that keeps on giving.
Like a long goodbye like a stuck in your head song.
Singing all day long can't be wrong.
Her love's so right on.
It'll stay with you even when she's gone.

There's a picture on my phone I click on a million times a day.
Lingers in my mind like a vintage wine so good I get a buzz on the after taste.
There she goes again making my head spin.
She's the trip I keep a falling in.
