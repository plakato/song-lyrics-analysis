Behold Me Lyrics
by The Wrens.

There's a twisting of things and it starts till it rings.
Comes as cold then it's gone can you help me.
There's a struggle of pants and of skin covered ants.
And with that it's done to can you help me.
There's a darkening joy as I'm both girl and boy.
Have my way with ourselves can you help me.
The things I know / behold me / one side of me.
