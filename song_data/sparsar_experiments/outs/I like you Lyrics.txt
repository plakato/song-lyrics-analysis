I like you Lyrics
by Rwhisky Champ.


I was drinking.
Out in the club.
Me and my homies then i look at her,she was so sexy oh i like her,she's a.
stripper but i don't even care,you can say that i'm inlove with a.
stripper,then she askin' me do you have a minute,then i asked her do you.
really wanna talk about it,we can go to the back and do something,but then we.
went to the back,do our thing and then i am back oh.

I don't know even your name,but i like your ass,i feel you girl,should i take.
you home,girl i like you,but does it mean take you home,popin' few.
bottles,then we just go right there.

If this is love,then i kinda like it,i never felt so happy in my life,sexy.
women just all over me,not too many but i'm talkin' 'bout you, yeah m so drunk.
at the morning i just wanna know your name,that all,she was asking me do you.
believe in love,i said not at the mment but you just made me went bck and.
break my promises cause i be feeling like,i'm really loving you.
