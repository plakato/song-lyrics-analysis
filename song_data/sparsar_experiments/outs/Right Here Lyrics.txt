Right Here Lyrics

Coko - SWV.

Lately, there's seem to be.
Some insecurities.
About the way I feel.
Where I wanna be.
But you know, it's with you.
No one can do.
The things you do.
To me.
Never to be mistaking.
Long as it's love we're making.
There'll be no hesitating.
You and me.
It always will be.
And I won't leave.
Your side.
Cause you know.

Right here.
Be right here.
Right here.
Be right here.
No fear.
Have no fear.
No tears.
Love is here.

True love, some don't believe in.
That's what just I'm givin'.
I'm gonna keep it strong.
I'll be holding on.
To you.
No one can do.
Me like you do.
It's true.
Sure as the sun is shining.
Our love will keep on climbing.
There's gonna be some rain.
Gonna be some pain.
But as long as I know.
Boy, time will show.
Our love will grow.
And I know.

Won't let go.
You should know.
This thang is real.
No questions.
Just listen.
To.
Your heart and.
Love will be right.

Baby, what's the problem, it seems like we're having trouble.
You don't seem to understand.
The life I lead ain't double.
My heart belongs to you, and only you.
And you know it's true.
A phony imitation just won't do.
Relax your mind, I'm not the kind who runs around and wastes no time.
On the fine brothers that just don't compare.
I'll be there, I swear, far and near, have no fear.
I don't care.
You can count on me, I'm right here.

SWV.
Love's gonna be.
Love's gonna be.
Love's gonna be.
Love's gonna be.
Love's gonna be.
Love's gonna be.
Be right here.
No fear.
Love's gonna be.
Love's gonna be.
Love's gonna be.
Love's gonna be.
Love is here.
