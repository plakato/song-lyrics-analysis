Ice JJ Fish Lyrics
by Switch Floz.


Uh, alright yurrr 
R.I., R, R R.I 
 
R.I.P, the Pimp as the world turn 
Double cup stuff dip. My weed slow burn, 
Break a bitch down dick her down for what she earned 
Talk so slick with my ice jj fish. What it is bitch 
 
When, I'm chilling. I be Maccin' when a nigga running game man, I'm try'na pull
chucc 
Not, to be confuse with the wool which mean that a nigga try'na pull ya luck, 
A, swindler, finesser Jessica â€“ Trisha Vanessa, 
Since, pimpping been pimping. Them hoes been prostituting since prostitution
 
Cougar with me got more books than Barnes and Nobel 
But still down for the pimp like Bun through the struggle 
I played the hands I was dealt. I never asked for shuffles 
They talking stacking chips up, but I ain't talking ruffles 
 
Tryna' get the chips I been on the road, 
Fucking bad bitches, counting scrilla, that's the goal. 
They say: im a trip. I just know these hoes 
They be scheming from the corporate off into the polls. What you talkin' bout, 
No, ya, facts, nigga, tryna' gain! They don't know the rules. 
Can'T be mad at me. Bitches post to choose check your ho 
Come in at mistake, but we see it all the time had it lock. Then I creep up
from behind, like player, do 
 
Bitch, I'm on my ice shit couple. It look like white bricks. 
She said it look like peanut butter. Bitch I'm on my fuck shit 
Water gang that shit priceless. I beat the Tina. I got the Ike shit 
Mack be on that blow shit that 44 I stay close with 
You. Don'T want no problems, you don't want no drama 
I be on my grizzy. I do this shit for my momma 
I be kicking that flow and the pimp shit im bout. My business I got the
shizznit 
You can swim or drown in the ocean. I got the fish on me. That'S dope, shit, aye, 
,
