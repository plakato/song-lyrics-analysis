In Memory Of Me Lyrics
by Wolverine.

So many memories, I recall.
Wish I could do it all again.
All of those years, have come to pass too soon.
Part of me dies with our demise.
Try to speak but I can't find the words.

Wave goodbye to all I thought I'd be.

Guess it's time to go, time to leave the past behind.

Time to face the truth and let go of what's to hold.
All these tears of mine celebrate our deed.
They are a token of what we achieved.
Sorrow and pride, chaos and peace of mind.
Bitter and sweet, we're moving on.
Try to speak but I can't find the words.

Wave goodbye to all I thought I'd be.

Guess it's time to go, time to leave the past behind.

Time to face the truth and let go of what's to hold.
The road ahead has many ends.
Where we'll end up we still don't know.
I'll be proud as I travel, proud of what I am leaving.
Now there's no time to be afraid.
We'll see the future eye to eye.
I don't care what tomorrow brings.
I strongly believe in who I am.
Now when I speak I finally find the words.

Wave hello to who I came to be.

Now it's time for me, time to see with open eyes.

Time to face the truth and embrace what's there to hold.
