Casting Such A Thin Shadow Lyrics
by Underoath.

Speak up.
My ears are growing weary.
Ill sing this to the end.
And watch the waves crash over me.
Speak up.
My ears are growing weary.
Ill sing this to the end.
And watch the waves crash over me.
Not too much to overcome.
With enough time to turn it all around.
In a picture perfect scenery.
Ive become a stick figure illustration.
My eyes roll back.
And focus on whats ahead.
I can still stand if you lend.
The hand to brace me.
Ill take this on my own.
Ill take this on my own.
Ill take this on.
