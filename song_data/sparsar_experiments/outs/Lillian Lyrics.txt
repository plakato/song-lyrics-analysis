Lillian Lyrics
by +44.

The place I used to live made me feel like a tourist.
I couldn't coexist with the cold and suspicious.
When the last remaining light was starting to filter.
It seemed the perfect time to step into the future.

Your heart is a grave to be perfectly honest.
Your mouth's a smoking gun.
And you smile while you're twisting the knife in my stomach.
Until everything is gone.
Take all you can from me.
I've got weak constitution.
I'm led so easily.
So easily.

I left it all behind in the dead of last winter.
I left it all behind but the question still lingers.
So long, forgotten friends, no, you don't know the difference.
Between love and submission, and I'm not that obedient.

And she's trying to sleep it off.
With her head on my shoulder.
And I'm trying to keep it out.
Of my thoughts when I hold her.
And she's trying to sleep it off.
With her head on my shoulder.
And I'm trying to keep it out.
Of my thoughts when I hold her.
