Christian Brothers Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


No bad dream fucker's going to boss me around.
Christian brothers gonna take him down.
But it can't help me get over.

Don't be cross, it's sick I want.
I've seen the boss blink on and off.

Fake concerns is what's the matter, man.
And you think I ought to shake.
Your motherfucking hand.
Well, I know how much you care.

Come here by me, I want you here.
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear.

Come here by me, I want you here.
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear.
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear.
