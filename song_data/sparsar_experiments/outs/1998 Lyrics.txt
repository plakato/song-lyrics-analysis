1998 Lyrics
by Twitchy.


Ayo.
1998 when i was born.
Became a little rebel from the rest of the world i was torn.
Now you gon see the story progress, wheres the popcorn?
Now ive aged up, well dressed, call me well worn.
So baby tell me whos the realest.
And the illest fucking rapper in world, whos the sikest?
Better say twitchy, with truth in its fullest!
I flow elegant.
Rappers try to step to me, when they all irrelevant.
Dont rhyme for hell of it.
But for speaking on my mind, and the benefit.
Was always complex.
Awkward, spoke outta context.
I mob out, do flex.
People think i do drugs, have sex.
Do this, do that.
Bitch all i do is rap.
That or either take a nap.
You dont know anything, so go ahead and shut ye trap.
They say i ain't intelligent.
Say im just ensnarement.
But im not and i say that as a definite.
I dont slur words so fuck a speach impediment.
Im BACK on that boom bap shit.
I used to bump sum41 had a real fap lip.
Used to hate rap, oops did i let that slip?
Now i ain't about that life, fuck that rip.
Rest in peace, to the old me, at lease i wasn't hateful, i let that increse.
Now i stress shit, punch shit, release.
Cause.

1998 when i was born.
Became a little rebel from the rest of.
The world i was torn.
Now you gon see the story progress, wheres the popcorn?
Now ive aged up, well dressed, call me well worn/.
X2.

I liked Gameboy and sonic.
Not whores and some chronic.
Made good choices, now im rappin bout the topic.
Now ive changed a whole lot, now my life seems chaotic.
Cause it is some times.
But i get threw it.
I just make some rhymes.
Then i get to it.
As child i never gave a fuck.
I sold lemonade just to a buck.
And now i think im outta luck.
Only cared bout cartoons and a tonka truck.
Now its writing and clothes.
But i never gave a fuck about my rep from some hoes.
Only cared about pokemon and my bros.
Now i care about getting fans and some shows.
Cause.
