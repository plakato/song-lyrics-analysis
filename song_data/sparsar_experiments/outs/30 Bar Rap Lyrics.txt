30 Bar Rap Lyrics
by Xian.


It'S 2k11 and I'm going insane 
Chilling in this good year, I'm on top of the game. 
I'M like the child of two Steins R. L. and Ein-. 
My genius is terrifying. How do I find
time 
To stay original when all these niggas trying to mime 
All these Big Sean Young Money, stop punch lines? 
My execution is classic I'm firing lines, 
Dedicated, chicks, yeah! I get the best love 
I give them a chest. Rub got 7 bitches. Just like S, Club 
Not, provoked or enticed by any one tweet 
But would still jump a nigga like 21 Street 
Victory, not defeat if we'd happen to meet 
Off the top or written I'd be shittin' on you, kittens 
Crittin' and never hittin' 
Throat slittin' wit. Every sentence. 
Administerin', the penance 
And, let your girl witness 
Getting a lot of bread. My nigga, I stack pita 
Saiyan in this bitch, I'm the black Vegeta 
Hopping obstacles parkour like Peter 
Daily meat, eater, 
Carnivore, no PETA, 
I'm, not spider-man, but I am a Marvel. 
A full grown adult y'all niggas, just larval 
I'm the best from here all the way to the Bay Area 
Shooting from long range. I'M so J. J. Barea, 
7, kill streak. Here comes my harrier 
You niggas just Ron, but I'm so much Harry-er 
I'm the best and that's the end 
By the way I'm Xian
