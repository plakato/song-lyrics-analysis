Adrian S.O.S. Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Clock strikes midnight, a wolf adores the moon.
The vanguard of hell is coming soon.

The devil touched the cradle, god gets his curse.
Son of Satan's coming, to free all the slaves.
He's coming straight from hell, through its burning gates.
He grew in a womb of a hellpossessed whore.
Born to be a king to give the badness war.

Free and wild, Satan's child.
Adrian's taking the crown.
Destruction and war, opening hell's door.
To bring oppression down.

Pentagram's his landmark, everywhere he has grown.
He only needs one glance, to burn you to the bone.
Bodies of the racists are decaying in the sun.
He give 'em hell, no place to run.
Each hunter becomes a victim of his power and his hate.
Destroying all these bastards, Adrian's their fate.
He's the new faith, the saviour to the weak.
Destroying your oppression, he's the freedom you seek.

Free and wild, Satan's child.
Adrian's taking the crown.
Destruction and war, opening hell's door.
To bring oppression down.

Adrian, son of Satan.
Adrian, son of Satan.

Birth.
