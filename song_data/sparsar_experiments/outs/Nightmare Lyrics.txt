Nightmare Lyrics
by The Undead.


I saw it in their faces.
I read it in the magazines.
People lost and shattered.
Stranded in the dark.
It only happens to the ones.
Who got little to begin with.
I can't understand it, I never will.
Annihilation without a cause.
Houses turned to rubble.
Streets struck down without a care.
Schools and cathedrals.
Erased with frightening ease.
It only happens to the ones.
Who got little to begin with.
I can't understand it, I never will.
Annihilation without a cause.
With speed all these disasters.
Allow nobody to escape.
Victims without weapons.
Are always easy prey.
It only happens to the ones.
Who got little to begin with.
I can't understand it, I never will.
Annihilation without a cause.
So tell me is this justice.
Do some get fat without a care.
Save your god and f**k your laws.
We're running out of graves.
It only happens to the ones.
Who got little to begin with.
I can't understand it, I never will.
Annihilation without a cause.
