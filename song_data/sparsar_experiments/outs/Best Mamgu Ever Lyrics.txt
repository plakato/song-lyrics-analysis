Best Mamgu Ever Lyrics
by Underworld.

You float.
Come down slow.
Full association.
I hear you.
I hear wheels.
On marbled floor.
You drop.
White China hotel.
For more.

The wind is dripping from you face.
Between me and the Sun.
I love the way you don't fall.
When I'm hungry.
Your silence.
Is like a kiss, I feed you.
Remember you.
