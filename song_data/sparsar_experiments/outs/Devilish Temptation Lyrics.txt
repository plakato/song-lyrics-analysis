Devilish Temptation Lyrics
by Voice.

Trapped in the world of broken hearts.
The killing future has begun.
Your hope lays down in broken parts.
Welcome to this suicide command.
I am the destroyer.
By your weakness I fetch your soul.
I am the healer.
Of your fears out in the cold.

Fire and ice.
Sun in the night.
Devilish temptations hold you tight.
The ghost of evil spreads out his mighty wings.
Fire and ice.
Sun in the night.
Now I'm here to break your pride.
Behind the mask of pleasure arises.
The devil in disguise.

Paradise changed into hell.
Your trip comes slowly to an end.
You feel the unbearable pain.
Till you feel free in your fortress again.
I am the destroyer.
By your weakness I fetch your soul.
I am the healer.
Of your fears out in the cold.

Fire and ice.
Sun in the night.
Devilish temptations hold you tight.
The ghost of evil spreads out his mighty wings.
Fire and ice.
Sun in the night.
Now I'm here to break your pride.
Behind the mask of pleasure arises.
The devil in disguise.

Fire and ice.
Sun in the night.
Devilish temptations hold you tight.
The ghost of evil spreads out his mighty wings.
Fire and ice.
Sun in the night.
Now I'm here to break your pride.
Behind the mask of pleasure arises.
The devil in disguise.
