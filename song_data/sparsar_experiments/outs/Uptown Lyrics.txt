Uptown Lyrics
by 504 Boys.

Taxi 
Did, you call a taxi 
Master P 
Yea 
Taxi 
Where you going my brother 
Master P, 
Uptown. Ya heard me: Calliope 36-49 go cross, the Broad 

I'll be hangin' uptown 
With, my niggas 
Yea Yea Yea Yea Yea 
 
Uptown baby. Don'T clown baby 
It's going down baby! I'M with my rounds, baby, 
Uptown, CP3 nigga, my block stay hot 
Erato and Dorgenois nigga. I got it on lock, 
From the Mac to the Melph to the Calliope 
Nigga in the bricks at night. Fool anything goes 
Rose Tavern is the spot. Were I stash the Glock 
Hoody Hoo Run Forest here comes the cops 
Nigga second line fast when my peeps get killed, 
R.I.P. T-shirts nigga to remember the real 
Sam Skulley got killed and Big Glen got knifed 
My lil cousin Jimmy did 8 
But. Now he's trying to change his life 
 
Now. Let me take you to the land of the choppers 
Pussy poppers and body droppers 
Crooked cops and quarter shops 
When, the cop shopper, 
You get your hands on a a bird 
Don't say a word 
There's: a million coke spots with no coke to serve 
Ain't that that Nerve 
When, you see them nigga swerve in they Lexus 
And. You can't get no bus, pass 
To, get your ski mask and get a clique 
But make sure it niggas. You been fucking with 
Get a bitch who bout that murder murder and sucking dick 
On. The slick doe cause they pulling kickdoes 
And. I think it was them nigga out that Thomas 
Cause they had them black rags and bombers. 
But. You ain't hear that me. I can't talk. I can't see 

Ain't that how a nigga be 
I be on GT with Wiz and Boo 
When them fucking people spin in my niggas holla OOP OOP 
And. If a nigga find ya, we second line behind ya 
Blow some ganja in your memory, 
And sport, your tee, just to remind ya 
We, still 
 
Now. If you looking for me playa 
When, I'm down in the city 
You wan na get with me, then hit me 
Or come in that Calliope and get me 
For real, ask Juan and Ize 
I be down in the cut 
Me. Boo Gio and Teedy 
We be tearing shit up 
Them my rounds, uptown them tough guys on the block. 
Just, like Slim and Marcelo 
They, got that Nolia on lock 
And that Rose Tavern, 
I'm chillling right in front of Randall picture 
They hit cha, but ask Victor 
We gon', always be with cha 
I. Let Lil Cory tell a story while he down in the 5th 
I hit the spliff pass. The tweet and yell CP3 
We make a move and bounce to House of Blues 
Full of tequila. We left the daiquiri shop, 
Them po po's sweating the block 
And. Now it's back to the Calliope 
 
The driveway in the middle of Dorgenois Court 
I represent it lil, daddy, 
Cause, it's a Calliope thing. 
And uptown is the place where I chill and hang
