Suite Life Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


In this country, you gotta make the money first.
Then when you get the money, you get the power.
Then when you get the POWER, then you get the woman....
That's why you gotta make your own moves.

Hoping that I fucking hit the lotto.
My moneys never low stacking see me in the grotto.
They saying that i'm nice, Dori that your flow legato.
Hoping I don't post another track these kids are looking fraud; armato.
?

Asking Dori in the set, like who is he, what to be, flex on me and i'ma get.
you decked.
I'ma tell you where I wanna be I wanna be on deck.
Like i'm swimming with young Zack and Cody we gon' make it fresh.

It's a suite life.
It's a suite life.
Go on live it quick, live it fast like you need life.
It's a suite life.
It's a suite life.
Go on live it quick, live it fast do you breathe right?
