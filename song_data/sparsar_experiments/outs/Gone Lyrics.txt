Gone Lyrics
by Yung Ro.

Chamillionaire 
World: what's the deal yeeah 
Been living long and living wrong? 
But, I'm still here: yeah 
I'm, standing, strooooooooooong 
Well; well: well: hey heeeey, oooh 
Come on my-yyyy yeeah, ooooooo-ooooooh, 
Baby, baby-baby, m-hmm-hm-hm, 
 
I had a real lady, but now she's gone 
Had, so called friends baby. But now they gone, 
I sat right here daily, like what went wrong. 
Pain is what I feel daily. That'S why I wrote this song 
 
Yung Ro 
I can write forever bout. My pain till my pen run to ink about it, 
I'm a sinner dear Lord. If I ain't doing it, I'm thinking bout it 
Surrounded by these hoe niggas, who sometimes they guys 
Use to spend my time. Looking in my woman's innocent eyes, 
But that place in me died. I think it left with the game 
And. She followed right behind now. I'M just left with this pain 
And, my so called real niggas, really ain't real 
Cause. If we ain't getting high, can't find no purpose to chill 
Now tell me: what's that about can't fuck with y'all no mo' 
But niggas still be thinking a sweet gon get'em through my do' 
Fuck, a friend trust, nobody nigga! That'S how I feel lately 
Niggas turn fake plus I fucked up and lost a real lady 
It's, getting real shady, my back against the wall, 
It's kill or be killed. My attitude like fuck'em all 
But. What about my lady been feeling lonely. Lately 
So I've been finger. Fucking my pistol and going crazy 
All, I feel, is the pain. All I know is the game 
So. I can't quit. Love me or leave me. I understand. 
You were my back bone help me come back strong 
And, I'm still left and still need you to come back home, 
, 
G'yeah, uh pain, pain, uh, 
And, I'm still strong, but still need you to come back home, 
, 
DJ, Paul Wall Gu-U. What'S up baby 
Hold it down pain-pain uh, yungro.com
