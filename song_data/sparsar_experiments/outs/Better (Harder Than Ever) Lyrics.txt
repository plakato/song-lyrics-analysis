Better (Harder Than Ever) Lyrics
by Swych.


Gohan, this isn't going to be a holiday.. We came here to train. 
Listen son you're, going to become a Super Saiyan 
Yes, 
, 
Uh 
If, I say Ima. Do it then Ima? Do it 
Yeah, but there's always room for improvement. 
Yeah, there's always room for improvement. 
There'S! Always room for improvement. 
If, I say Ima. Do it then Ima? Do it 
Yeah, but there's always room for improvement, 
 Yea and there's always room for improvement.. Haha
 
Umm now who's this, You may not know 
But after this I'll be the one that they say got flow 
I got 4-wheel drive rain, shine, snow, 
With, no 4x4's this! So autooooo- 
-Matic, I'm a hot 16 addict beams, scattered 
I am gon', make them all foooooo- 
Cus. Hocus Pocus 
Stagelights glowin.
Watch me po', an 
Ocean of emotions. Slowly
My ghost floats
