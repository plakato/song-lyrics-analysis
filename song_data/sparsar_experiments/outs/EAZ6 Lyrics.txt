Yea yea yea 
 
Re-re-remix killa for the niggas who don't know it. I be posted on the east
side east side 
Six on the way and I'm about to change the game, show them niggas how we ride
we ride. 
Know, it's all love but where the boy come from, they put a gun between your
peace sign., Fuh, Fiya, 
Zone, six nigga you'll get killed for the buzz, don't get caught up in the bee
hive 
Oh no ... 
Forever ... 
I ain't seen nutin' better 
I took a break From atlanta, pretty weather came back around like a merry-go 
Simple fella, but I want this shit forever. 
We in here, 
These rappers seasonal, like a county, fair 
I'm, the original you're lookin' like a spare 
Boy, you drop a hot song and be gone in a year. 
Aw. No ... 
What, they wan' do 
Memory loss. Well, let me remind you: 
That flow water. Like a fucking, monsoon 
If. I see her and I want her. I might get your mom soon 
Now, I'm your daddy forever 
Wordplay, really clever, 
That real shit'imma slip, her 
Now! She my cinderella, 
I, want her'imma cop, her 
Yea'imma buy her hella 
If. She was down to earth 
Now her attitude, pr-pr-pr-pr-propella 
Swing my way 
Girl I make every day feel like a friday 
It's the appetizer wait until the entre 
And I'll, be god damned. If I let you take some fucking food off of my plate, 
Cause, when I'm on a plane, I be on the way 
And. When I'm on the way she say. √Åndale 
Rollin', with my niggas tryna, get a change 
Now. We ran our bands up, I'm the one to blame, ...
