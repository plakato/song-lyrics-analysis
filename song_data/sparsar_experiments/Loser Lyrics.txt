Loser Lyrics
by VON.


Here I go again.
I keep letting you in.
Up underneath my skin.
Back into my heart.
Though I know the truth.
I play a fool for you.
Pretending like it's all cool.
Cause I'm the one.
You're coming home to.

But what's the use in.
Lettin' you in?
Lettin' you can't keep you hear.
And what's the use in.
Lovin' you if.
Lovin' you can't keep you near?

How many times.
Do you let a loser win?
You let a loser win.
You lose again and again.

Maybe I'm insane.
Expecting one day.
You'll find it right to change.
And be the one I dream to love.
But if you really wanted me.
It would be so clear to see.
But you always leavin' me.
And that ain't what I need.

So what's the use in.
Needin' you if.
Needin' you can't keep you hear?
And what's the use in.
Missin' you if.
Missin' you can't keep you near?
