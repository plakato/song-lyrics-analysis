Beverly Wyatt Lyrics
by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die.

With the greenery that surrounds me.

Just a walk through the open country.
It inflates me with an entirely different perspective.

After a winter with nothing left.
You need a place to rest your head.
And a great escape to make your hands warm.
But we will sleep again! When we feel it in our blood.
We will rest our heads! When the time comes.
I will open up my skin.

And let this small town in with love.

I will breathe this in.

Let it fill my lungs.

There should be a scar from the hours we've wasted at work.
Why should living be something we earn?
There should be a mark from the launch when we outgrew this Earth.
This ship keeps us safe until we return.
