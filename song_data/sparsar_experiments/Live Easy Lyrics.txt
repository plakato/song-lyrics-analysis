Lots of yall live life like its a burden mahn.

So some of yall just don't appreciate the lil things.
Don't you know that those same things could be somebodies everything.

So just lend me mahn your ears &amp; let your heart feel my flow.

So you know that i put my heart in a beat.
You know that a smile everyday is the best remedy.
