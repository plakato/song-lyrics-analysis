Cosmic Writing Lyrics
by Wordplay.


Yeah, I finished the race. You can see all of the champion all over my face.
Now my name is so common all over this place. Ha, so you mad, I can tell by.
your face.
Champions are born so call me 1994. Had to get famous so I wouldn't end up.
poor.
Groupies at my house like my ass is on a would tour.
Or instead like Trey Songz house got a revolving door.
Want more? Buy my CDs and follow me on Twitter. I was told by my father to.
never be a quitter.
I'm a hot spitter, fire dragon in the river. Skating through life like I'm.
sponsored by QuickSilver.
Too busy writing songs, tell Imo's to deliver.
I had to stop the drinking before my body lost a liver.
I use to be the kid that no one cared about.
That's why you have to keep screaming till they hear you out.

It's written in the stars to be the best you can be.
My future's bright, I clearly got 20/20.
I needed a break. Senior year, I gave up all the believing and praying.
You only live once so you got to make life the best.
Before the start of the race my heart's pumping out my chest.
Like Chipmunk said, I was born to be a champion.
My fight is fueled with fire like my homeboy Flareon.
Get it? Now back to my ways. I remember them time when I would have bad days.
Now everyday is good, living life for today.
Oklahoma Sooners, so everything is okay.
I'm a nigga running in the jungle like Temple Run.
Living life to the fullest is something way past fun.
I use to be the kid that no one cared about.
That's why you have to keep screaming till they hear you out.
