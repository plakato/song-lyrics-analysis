How Hustlers Do It Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


Bounce, Paul Wall let's see if we can make these hoes bounce.
Keke what's up nigga,.

Webbie.
Now I been looking around, I see some pretty lil' thangs out.
This all making sense, thats' the reason why I came out.
Big fine, make you wanna squeeze letting it hang out.
Addictive and deceivers, one of these I'ma bring out.
Meet me at the bar, I don't like the way they treat me at the bar.
So I snuck a couple gallons, out the car.
Oh boy this bitch thick, you know we like the times when it's thick.
Me and the click get the shine, on all bitches.
Big fat diamond chain, know I'm blinding those bitches.
Work that big fat thang, wish she had mo' titties.
But she got enough bank, to take the snack so I ain't tripping.
I was hitting she was licking Paul Wall, that's pimping.
Told her might as well keep your drawas off, cause all niggas all right.
Down the hall, and bout doing some'ing with ya.
From the artist to record em mayn, the whole trio hit her.
Then she hollered, I ain't never fucked this many real niggas.

This how them hustlers do it, I prolly creep with em.
I don't love em, I don't smoke and I don't lean with em.
Yeah y'all nothing but tens, if I'm seen with em.
It don't take that much, for me to lean with em.
And money raining, look I'm staying.
Whatever in here, she ain't doing no complaining.
Money raining, look I'm staying.
Whatever in here, she ain't doing no complaining.

Lil' Keke.
Straight to the bar, for a shot of Patrone.
If I wink and she blink, garunteed it's on.
This pimping over here, baby play no game.
With them shorts in your ass, you lil' nasty thang.
Hey after the club, it's the hotel lobby.
The Don is the truth, not a carbon copy.
She drunk and sloppy, and full of them beans.
My team is kushed out, and we full of that lean.
Pull out the magnum, I'm tightly strapped.
It was straight to the slab, with her head in my lap.
I'm high as a moon, candy maroon.
84's and butter rolls, so nigga stay tuned.
A playa for real, they see the stacks I'm gaining.
This Swishahouse trick, and the money is raining.
California king, I keep three in the bed.
I was getting some head, get-getting some head.

Yung Redd.
I ain't Mannie, but I'm fresh.
Got a house full of swishas, mayn I'm rolling up the best know I'm tal'n bout.
A lil' bit of that kush, just to give me that push.
Paint wet like rain, boy them hoes gon look.
Slim frame, T. Farris got my paper large.
Fame and your gal, I'm on her IPOD.
I been shining, and I ain't lying.
Head to the Harlem Nights, money flying.
Ran with whole some'ing screwed, if you ain't know.
Different color flavors in my chain, taste the rainbow.
It's real talk, let me show you what the hood like.
Fate similar that you'll, taste the good life.
Different hoes, different reasons.
Yeah I hustle all year, so I'm balling all season.
Purple rain, got me leaning.
You on the sideline talking, but I got the hoes leaving.
