50 Cent 
New York City 
You, are now rapping .... With 50 Cent. 
You got ta love it ... 
I, just wan na chill and twist a lot 
Catch suns in my 7-45 
You drive me crazy shorty. I 
Need to see you and feel you next to me. 
I provide everything you need and I 
Like your smile. I don't wan na see you cry 
Got some questions that I got to ask and I 
Hope you can come up with the answers: babe 
, 
Nate, Dogg, 
Girl .... It'S easy to love me now, 
Would! You love me if I was down and out 
Would, you still have love for me. 
Girl ..., It's easy to love me now! 
Would! You love me. If I was down and out 
Would, you still have love for me. Girl, ...,

If. I fell off tomorrow. Would you still love me 
If, I didn't smell so good. Would you still hug me 
If? I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century 
Could. I count on you to be there to support me mentally 
If. I went back to a hoopty from a Benz 
Would you poof and disappear. Like some of my friends 
If I was hit and I was hurt. Would you be by my side 
If it was time to put in work. Would you be down to ride 
I'd, get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive 
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside 
If? I ain't rap cause I flipped burgers at Burger King 
Would. You be ashamed to tell your friends. You feelin' me 
And in bed. If I used to my tongue, would you like that 
If? I wrote you a love letter. Would you write back 
Now? We can have a lil' drink. You know a nightcap 
And. We could go. Do what you like. I know you like that: 
 
Nate, Dogg, 
Girl .... It'S easy to love me now! 
Would! You love me. If I was down and out 
Would, you still have love for me: 
 
Monica, 
Boy .... It'S easy to love me now! 
Would! You love me. If I was down and out 
Would, you still have love for me: 
 
I ain't, looking for no superman to try and save me, 
I just want you to be my baby. 
Your sexy style got me going crazy, 
I wan na feel your body layin. Next to me, 
I can give you what you want. You need and dream 
I'll take care of. You fulfill your fantasies, 
Got some questions that I got to ask and I 
Hope you can come up with the answers. 
 
Boy .... It'S easy to love me now. 
Would you love me. If I was down and out 
Would, you still have love for me: 
 
Nate, Dogg, 
Girl .... It'S easy to love me now!

Now! Would you leave me if you're father found out, I was thuggin' 
Do, you believe me. When I tell you you the one I'm loving 
Are you mad cause, I'm asking you 21 questions, 
Are you, my soulmate Cause. If so girl you a blessing 
Do. You trust me enough to tell me your dreams, 
I'm staring at ya', trying to figure how you got in them. Jeans 
If, I was down. Would you say things to make me smile 
I, treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how 
If I was with some other chick, and someone happened to see 
And when you asked me about it. I said it wasn't me 
Would, you believe me Or up and leave me 
How. Deep, is our love. If that's all it takes for you to be gone, 
We only human girls, we make mistakes, 
To make it up. I do whatever it take. 
I love you like a fat, kid love, cake, 
You, know my style. I say anything to make. You smile,

Now. Can we let the past go so we can have a future 
When a push comes to shove. Would you come through for me, 
I can't be bad by myself, be sad by myself. 
I can't be broke by my damn self 
Would. It be too much to ask for you to be a man 
And. If you ever got mad, would you cause me pain? 
Would? You call me sweet things cause I'm your babygirl 
Would. I be your whole wide world 
Would, I be the apple of your eye. 
Would you ever want to make me cry 
If. You really want me by your side. 
Tell me: how hard would you try 
Don't get mad cause? I'M asking 21 questions. 
I'Ve learned my lesson before and I need to know
