Blame It on a Sad Song Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.



Blame it on a sad song in the night.
But all I can do is hang my head and cry.
But songs of the heart don't last forever.
Here I sit all by myself.

All those feelings will come back to haunt me.
You can blame it on a sad song, baby.
Cause not a day goes by that I don't think about you.
A crowd of people, they pass me by.
Blame it on a sad song.
Girl, it's got my heart reeling.


Oh, moment to moment, I get lost in time.
I don't want anyone but you to make it right.
Blame it on a sad song in the night.
But don't you give up on love cause you never say never.
Well, it's an old familiar feeling.
I know when we first started out.
Don't want to hear a sad song in the night.
Anymore.
Blame it on, blame it on a sad song.
Wondering how she could put our love on a shelf.
And many years from now when I hear that song come on the radio.
My heart will let me know.
I was your only love and you had no doubt.
