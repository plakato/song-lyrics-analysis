Dark Days Lyrics
by PUP (band).

This endless night
This funeral dirge
We celebrate life
At the end of the earth
When. Everything is gone
There'll, be nothing left. Lose

The ice is closing in
And, nothing will remain
We took what we could get
And. We burned it anyway

With all those secrets
We swore we'd. Take them to the grave
The light will falter and will fade
And in the darkness we'll say

This winter hasn't been so rough
Oh. It was cold, but still it wasn't. Cold enough
To freeze the blood beneath my spine
And at least I survived

We're sleeping through the days
And sinking like a ship
We're. Wasting away
Bit by bit

Everyone is gone
And. Everything is changed
It, won't ever be the same
And when it's over we'll say

This winter hasn't been so rough
Oh. It was cold, but still it wasn't. Cold enough
To freeze the blood beneath my spine
And at least I survived

We've had some dark days
We're in the thick of it now
And. When the ice breaks
There will be no one. Around

This winter hasn't been so rough
Oh. It was cold, but it wasn't cold, enough
To freeze the blood beneath my spine
And at least I survived

This winter hasn't been so rough
Oh. It was cold, but still it wasn't. Cold. Enough
To freeze the blood beneath my spine
At least I'll survive
