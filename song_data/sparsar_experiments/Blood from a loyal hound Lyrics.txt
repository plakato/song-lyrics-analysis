Blood from a loyal hound Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


Prostrated on the grave and hope approval lies beneath.
Sucking on all the days we always tried to keep.
Knotted like tentacles that stick and take the souvenir of texture.

Sip on blood.
From a loyal hound.
But I'll never make you dry.

One time I had someone who knew exactly what I wanted to be.
Fell down and hit my head on an inch of foam and bled right out.

Sip on blood.
From a loyal hound.
But I'll never make you dry.
