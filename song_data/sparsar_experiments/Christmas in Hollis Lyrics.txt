Christmas in Hollis Lyrics
by Run-D.M.C..

Run.
It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark.
When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park.
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear.
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer.
But then I was illin' because the man had a beard.
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared.
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone.
But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn.
I picket the wallet up but then I took a pause.
Took out the license and it cold said Santa Claus.
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's.
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease.
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right.
So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night.
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree.
Was a letter from Santa and all the dough was for me.

D.M.C..
It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens.
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens.
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese.
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees.
Decorate the house with lights at night.
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright.
In the fireplace is the yule log.
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog.
The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's.
But each and every year we bust Christmas carols.

Run-D.M.C..
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it.
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit.
Jack Frost chillin', the.
hawk is out.
And that's what Christmas is all about.
The time is now, the place is here.
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer.

D.M.C..
My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand.
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman.
So open your eyes, lend us an ear.
We want to say.

Run-D.M.C..
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
