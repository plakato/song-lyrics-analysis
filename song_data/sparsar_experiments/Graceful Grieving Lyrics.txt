Graceful Grieving Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Rest my head til my line goes beep.
Ima cook that kief 'til my eyes turn green.

Smoking with a bitch in the back seat thinking ima snap gees.
Like maybe I could rap for the rap cheese.

M u r k m o b.
Please don't ask to rap with me.
If I catch you in my spot i'm gonna leave you fucking weak.

I don't wanna go through.
Anybody don't you.
Smoke away the pain like.
Everybody's throat loose.

Now you niggas feel it but leave me out of the scope.
I suppose you believe in a leader out of your postal.

How the hell you fucked up.
Lucky I done fucked up.
That'll get you cuffed but.
I figured it was tough love.

I ain't with the scheming like what the fuck do you mean.
I'm just looking for them dollas I'm ducking out for the green.

So it's money make season.
I wanna take pieces.
Of everybody's pocket.
Like I'm on a fake Visa.
Now I'm hypocrite and I don't like to make scenes.
So if you help me take the shit and make it flip we'll break even uh.

It's so devious so play decent.
Anemic motherfuckers like you niggas hate eating uh.
Need for speed I'm like TV Clutch your throat girl, cold world, but it's.
heating up i'm like.
