Raida's Theme Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.


What, do you know about 
Magic. A whole lot of magic. 
 
Roc Raida.? Mr. Sinista. Total Eclipse. Rob Swift., We got Diamond J, Johnny
Cash Sean C Stevie D, Dr. Butcher, 
 
We got the X-Men 
The nine live best men, 
Who fucking with them cat Lies the question. 
Here'S the thing you know about the trouble they bring 
Bubbling things 
1-2 double O kings, 
So, get it right. 
See. I ain't infatuated with the hype 
Before this Total Eclipse. Now you see the light 
Type unique 
First rate style critique, 
They complete with that karat gold technique. 
Roc live'95, he was man of the year 
Catching wreck with the left right hand in the air, 
Watch them copy cat, niggas 
Them OT, sloppy wack niggas 
Mess around probably slap niggas, 
Like cross faders trying to cross Raida 
Don't. They know yo, they messing with them. Boss players 
With no fears, 
Leaving cats under the stairs 
For years with mega cuts coming in pairs, 
We, giving'em, morn' and noon, and nightmares 
To share. 
They, don't want none of this here, 
Yeah ya, past ways. Your last day is today: 
Roc Rai' leave them niggas, M.I.A 
 
You think you nice, as ha ha you'se a funny nigga Big L'Put, It
On' 
Yo 
 
Screen scene coast to coast last dream team. 
I bet that I'ma stir these cats to clean things. 
Clean house 
Up in Japan and down south 
Club bars to seminars they going all out 
From the ground under 
Strike back like thunder, 
You can fight back. They tight black. Take a number 
You got. Nine tries various ways to die. 
Find it very hard to spy. They got 18 eyes, 
You surprised it's the X-Men G 
They breeze through mo' slick niggas than the H.I.V 
Holding, the key 
Live niggas rolling with me. 
On this compilation, rough complications, patna 
I did it for the hype. 
I did it tonight, 
I. Did it cause me and Raida is tight, 
Simply 
My, niggas stay hot, strictly 
They cuts manual and yours on 
Get. It tight, get it right, get naughty 
Get a life cause your ass. Is nobody 
And any time you ready. We gon' set the track. 
X-Men E. Brothers dunn remember that
