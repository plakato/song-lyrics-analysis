Kickin Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

I threw my wishes down the well, but the well went dry.
Can't seem to get ahead, I'm always three steps behind.
The fortune teller said, I guess she wasn't lying.
You can't sell your soul these days cause nobody's buying.
I keep on kickin.
I keep on kickin.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Cause I won't listen.
I keep on kickin.
They say you better go to church, you better stay in school.
Always listen to your mama, never ever break a rule.
I can't live inside your lies, I think they're kinda dumb.
You can point your finger, but I'm only having fun.
I keep on kickin.
I keep on kickin.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Cause I won't listen.
I keep on kickin.
I keep on kickin.
If you think you'll hold me down.
Just keep on wishing.
I keep on kickin.
This one's for the kids, who are barely getting by.
Never growing up, who never even tried.
I'd like to make a toast, to those who criticize.
You can kiss my ***, cause until the day I die.
I keep on kickin.
I keep on kickin.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Cause I won't listen.
I keep on kickin.
I keep on kickin.
If you think you'll hold me down.
Just keep on wishing.
I keep on kickin.
