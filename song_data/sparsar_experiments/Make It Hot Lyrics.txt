Make It Hot Lyrics
by Rufus Blaq.


Put your love signs in the air, 
Spread love 
A to the M-B-U-S-H 
What. We do Feed on platinum plates 
Feed on platinum, plates, 
, 
Yo, a-yo, yo, yo, 
When, you're, hot you're hot. When you're warm you flop, 
I'm the cat, that's impossible to drop 
And. I rock parties on a global scale, 
Ghetto to ghetto everybody know me well, 
So, I roll with a clique, that's thick like Big Lez 
And. My shit hits you hard, like Chavez. 
I stay laced, no matter the damn weather 
Jewels to match my baby lamb's leather 
Keep mademoiselle in classic Chanel 
Gator napsack cuz. I trick well 
Work the dick well 
Hustle, the quick mail 
Sitting back smiling as the hits sell, 
Cats useless like a key of flour. 
Playa-Hatin' on mine, when they feel the power 
C'est la vie, everyday is still payday 
You a slab of pork, I'm a swordfish, filet, 
 
We just want to make it hot 
Getting cream and win 
Steady rising to the top 
We just want to make it hot. My crew baby 
We ain't, never gon na stop 
 
I'm, Big Chad, jiggy 
I got the finest on my dime list. 
And. I keep a Breitling on my wrist 
Try this. It will get you more 
And, it's sick, how the tune kicks shore to shore 
Now, my crib got jacuz and marble floors, 
With the gold faucet and the royal doors 
Get yours, it's all about the game, and I got that 
I can lace any artist with a Hot track: 
And, it's not Bad Boy! Ya got that 
Ambush. We got what you like 
Me and Blaq nonstop on the rise 
When. The plan was devised, 
Split the pies 
 
When. It comes to flow. I'M a sick cat 
And, the platinum plaque I'ma get that 
And. The chick from the Spice Girls I'ma hit that 
Stay on top fall off. Forget that 
I walk the streets everyday, like a runway 
Trying to get paid. I ain't with the gunplay 
I'm about cutting the pie. 
Get the money yall it ain't, nothing to try. 
I was getting mine before I let the world know me 
Chicks cry on me that look like Naiomi 
B to the L, ah, A to the Q. Ah 
And. These Ambush cats will run right through ya,
