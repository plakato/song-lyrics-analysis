Make It Hot Lyrics
by Rufus Blaq.


Put your love signs in the air.
Spread love.
A to the M-B-U-S-H.
What we do? Feed on platinum plates.
Feed on platinum plates.

Yo, a-yo, yo, yo.
When you're hot you're hot, when you're warm you flop.
I'm the cat that's impossible to drop.
And I rock parties on a global scale.
Ghetto to ghetto, everybody know me well.
So I roll with a clique that's thick like Big Lez.
And my shit hits you hard like Chavez.
I stay laced, no matter the damn weather.
Jewels to match my baby lamb's leather.
Keep mademoiselle in classic Chanel.
Gator napsack, cuz I trick well.
Work the dick well.
Hustle the quick mail.
Sitting back smiling as the hits sell.
Cats useless like a key of flour.
Playa-hatin' on mine when they feel the power.
C'est la vie, everyday is still payday.
You a slab of pork, I'm a swordfish filet.

We just want to make it hot.
Getting cream and win.
Steady rising to the top.
We just want to make it hot, my crew baby.
We ain't never gonna stop.

I'm Big Chad jiggy.
I got the finest on my dime list.
And I keep a Breitling on my wrist.
Try this it will get you more.
And it's sick how the tune kicks shore to shore.
Now my crib got jacuz and marble floors.
With the gold faucet and the royal doors.
Get yours, it's all about the game and I got that.
I can lace any artist with a hot track.
And it's not Bad Boy, ya got that.
Ambush, we got what you like.
Me and Blaq, nonstop on the rise.
When the plan was devised.
Split the pies.

When it comes to flow, I'm a sick cat.
And the platinum plaque, I'ma get that.
And the chick from the Spice Girls, I'ma hit that.
Stay on top, fall off, forget that.
I walk the streets everyday like a runway.
Trying to get paid, I ain't with the gunplay.
I'm about cutting the pie.
Get the money yall, it ain't nothing to try.
I was getting mine before I let the world know me.
Chicks cry on me that look like Naiomi.
B to the L ah, A to the Q ah.
And these Ambush cats will run right through ya.
