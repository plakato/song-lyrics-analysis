6. Lyrics
by The Wrens.

Rules, fools, the idiots that shower them in flowers.
Praise them great in open song.
Color by numbers copy one another I'll wolf you.
Promise stupid tiny bells.
Ain't find no favor for stacking for the tilted.
This fairground is getting close to closing won't it stop me?
Rank, split, my eyes are choked with water.
Seeing haters finger point at lesser skin.
Rupture, young lovers with rape and rank.
It shudders me to see the better thing as sin.
I won't believe that her of ways, of worth, of less of him.
Done back for others what split.
The hearts of mothers I know a quieting.
Behind the corn scratches diseased from the pities.
