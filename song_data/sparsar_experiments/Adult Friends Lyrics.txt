Adult Friends Lyrics
by Xiu Xiu.

Two tears in a bucket 
Adult, friends, adults, friends, 
Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug 
The world is what it is. 
 
Oh I kiss you --, nobody sees it 
Oh we hold hands --, nobody knows about it. 
Oh you kiss me --. We just sit there. 
Overly experienced 
Adult friends, adult friends, 
 
You've reduced your breasts to a more tasteful size D. 
When, I touch them. It is like a lobster crawling under my arm. 
 
Oh, I kiss you --. Nobody can see it 
Oh. I pinch your --. Nobody knows about it. 
Oh you fondle --, but we just sit there: 
With no tomorrows, 
Adult friends, adult friends
