Charger Lyrics
by Swift.

Indulge yourself for all of the eyes of the world to see.
Fickle in nature... the definition thereof.
Bashful for a moment, loving for a monent.
Trustworthy for a moment....
Trustworthy for a moment, but only for a moment.
Content... content for a moment, but only for a moment.

But so quick to page him with 1 4 3.
Impatient, improper and unhealthy.
Content... content for a moment, but only for a moment you'll beg.

In between the cracks they go. no one knows that they pulled back sheets and.
made their names.

In the middle of bliss it gets cold... it gets old, and you get hungry....
hungry for the things that you threw away.
And that made themselves open.
Content for a moment, but only for a moment.
Worthy... worthy for a moment, but no longer worthy for me.

Innocent on contact... unknowing that we knew the whole time and left you in.
the cracks long enough to hang yourself....

From.
Your Family.
Pin the A on your chest. your face showing regret.

In between the cracks they go. no one knows that they pulled back sheets and.
got their fame.

Indulge yourself for all of the eyes of the world to see.
Fickle in nature... the definition thereof.
Bashful for a moment, loving for a monent.
Trustworthy for a moment....
Trustworthy for a moment, but only for a moment.
Content... content for a moment, but only for a moment.
So beg.

In between the cracks they go. no one knows that they pulled back sheets to.
hide their shame.

If you want it so bad why don't you just take it.

Prynne the A on your chest? your face showing regret?
Shameful the lust you let win. your face showing regret.

Take it.
