Chonkyfire (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

Symbols from a horror movie  .
Bleeding from my empty walls  .
Everybody dies one day  .
So whend i miss the fuckin call  .
Listen to the vision that portrayed  .
Inside the mystic ball  .
Shillouhettes appear into the mirror  .
When i look away  .
The screams of every child  .
That the boogieman had took away  .
Flipping through the pages of a book  .
That i had read today  .
It said that fear is just a form  .
Of weakness at its greatest  .
And if you wanna earn the trust of a taurus  .
You need patience  .
You turn the other way  .
When i see you on the street  .
Imma catch you on the block  .
And make ya whole face bleed  .
The blades only get colder at an  .
Ice skating rink  .
The brave solider  .
Tazer owner  .
Lazy sofa stained sheets  .
The range rover  .
Changed owner  .
Caged stoner play for keeps  .
Aimin over everything  .
That everyone has ever seen  .
Im goin till i can't  .
Differentiate my dream  .
From reality  .
Its sad to see  .
The people i love struggle  .
So imma get it even when im dead  .
And lying under rubble  .
The homie day he told he  .
Always look outside the box  .
And tho it might seem like its trouble  .
Just be you until it stops.
.
