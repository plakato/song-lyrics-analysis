Fell Down a Hole Lyrics
by Wolfmother.

I wanna be in Wonderland.
I wanna get down in the sand.
She's got that magic touch.
I don't need to mess around.
Could you lend a hand?
Cause people don't understand.
She lives on her own.
Down in Wonderland.
I fell down a hole.
Into another town.
Living underground.
Looking for that sound.
She got everything on a string.
And everything else in between.
It don't matter which way or how.
Gonna have to get there somehow.
Could you lend a hand?
Cause people don't understand.
She lives on her own.
Down in Wonderland.
I fell down a hole.
Into another town.
Living underground.
Looking for that sound.
Oh, oh, she's got every little thing.
Hanging from a string.
Oh, she got every little thing.
Hanging from a string.
Oh, she got every little thing.
Hanging from a string.
Oh, she got every little thing.
Hanging from a string.
Could you lend a hand?
Cause people don't understand.
She lives on her own.
Down in Wonderland.
I fell down a hole.
Into another town.
Living underground.
Looking for that sound.
