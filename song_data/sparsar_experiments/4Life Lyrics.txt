We'bout this life for life, nigga, 
My, clique down for life sentence,

We'bout this life for life; 
Never leave home without my ice 
 
My bitch down for life clique Down for life 
Icy face, I can't beat the watch. I just know you're out of time. 
I can read your mind boy you're out your mind, 
Up or down yeah, I'm down for mine 
Yeah, I'm going in yeah, I'm out for mine, 
 
For lifer been a rider since I had no licence 
Been a rider since I had low mileage 
Now, I'm in A Spider screaming for life, bitch, 
No guidance, I'mma, be ghetto for life. 
The Bezel looks better with ice 
I'm a BBS' for life. 
You, don't see me stressing 
Covered in a town, and you see me dressing 
We're, wild and we're hungy. We feed off pressure 
I pop rubber bands. Yeah, you see me stretch her 
And, I'm down for life'til. I need a stretcher 
I be down for life for my Last Kings. Please keep resurrecting 
 
Yeah, my clique down for life sentence; 
My bitch down for life sentence; 
We'bout this life for life, nigga, 
My, clique down for life sentence; 
My bitch down for life sentence; 
We'bout this life for life; 
Never leave home without my ice 
 
My bitch Down for life clique down for life 
Icy face, I can't beat the watch. I just know you're out of time. 
Think your clique is down, but they ain't down to grind 
Yeah. Your bitch is down, but she ain't down as mine 
Look at my bitch thick as hold up 
 
The mafia bitches ride or die for your bitches 
Them gang niggas turn to bodyguards catching bodies for a nickle 
Day one's 
Fuckboys. That got me fucked up your boy. Gon', keep coming up for life, 
You Stan Smith. In the hood boy, you got no stripes 
She' The Walking Dead' my nigga. She ain't got no life. 
Me I'ma, be that nigga for life 
And. These hoes know I can only be her nigga for a night 
 
Yeah, my clique down for life sentence, 
My bitch down for life sentence; 
We'bout this life for life, nigga, 
My, clique down for life sentence, 
My bitch down for life sentence; 
We'bout this life for life; 
Never leave home without my ice 
 
My bitch down for life clique down for life 
Icy face, I can't beat the watch. I just know you're out of time. 
I can read your mind boy you're out your mind, 
Up or down yeah, I'm down for mine 
It's, like I lived four times cause it's for life
