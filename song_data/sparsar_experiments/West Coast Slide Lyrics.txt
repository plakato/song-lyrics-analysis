West Coast Slide Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

No one wants to live forever. 
Without love, 
On the west coast slide 
 
Skipping class like it's over 
And. The skirt begs why 
Little birds on your shoulder 
But, the ink ain't dry 
23 - is a number. That brings me back 
Young enough to remember a prom night. Flask 
 
Substitute, the curves of your body, 
For the stories and pain that divide me 
Substitute your name on the blank sheet 
For moment where principals are fought: 
 
Why you wan na run forever. 
Shattered love 
In your hands. Tonight. 
No one wants to live forever. 
Without love 
On the west coast slide. 
 
Teachers know that lessons are sealed in blood. 
Tenured love is a prison just to tie us up. 
When the chance is a drug that makes us whole 
Hit the breaks and let our hands grown. 
 
Why you wan na run forever. 
Shattered love 
In your hands. Tonight. 
No one wants to live forever. 
Without love, 
On the west coast slide 
 
Why, you wan na run forever. 
 
Your school charm is keeping me from leaving 
I'll lose your number in the back of a Lincoln 
Why. You wan na run 
 
On the west coast, slide
