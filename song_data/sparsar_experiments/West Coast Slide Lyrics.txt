West Coast Slide Lyrics
by Work Drugz.

No one wants to live forever.
Without love.
On the west coast slide.

Skipping class like it's over.
And the skirt begs why.
Little birds on your shoulder.
But the ink ain't dry.
23 is a number that brings me back.
Young enough to remember a prom night flask.

Substitute the curves of your body.
For the stories and pain that divide me.
Substitute your name on the blank sheet.
For moment where principals are fought.

Why you wanna run forever?
Shattered love.
In your hands tonight.
No one wants to live forever.
Without love.
On the west coast slide.

Teachers know that lessons are sealed in blood.
Tenured love is a prison, just to tie us up.
When the chance is a drug that makes us whole.
Hit the breaks and let our hands grown.

Why you wanna run forever?
Shattered love.
In your hands tonight.
No one wants to live forever.
Without love.
On the west coast slide.

Why you wanna run forever?

Your school charm is keeping me from leaving.
I'll lose your number in the back of a Lincoln.
Why you wanna run?

On the west coast slide.
