Anti Friendzone (Interlude) Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Anti.
Yeah yeah.
From a girl to a woman.
And from a queen to a goddess.
Honestly we were dishonest.
Still can't believe that we bonded.
Look at the team that we started.
We had a dream of.
Only upon your arrival.
I noticed we had departed.
We had the part where.
I was at parties in need of a partner.
Should have believed in my father.
I put my feet where my heart was.
I took you around the world.
Like Detective Lee did to Carter.
Damn it's rush hour.
I tried to tell you shoot for the stars.
But look how you snowed at the gunpowder.
We love power.
But the power of love can overcome that lust that was ours.
But what's ours.
Do we even have each other.
Do we even have another option.
If we can't rebuttal all of a sudden can't be subtle.
Can't discover.
How we went from hater brother.
From brother to fucking to fucking raw shit.
Then to lover.
I tried to tell you about that friendzone shit.
I ain't the man you hit the friendzone with.
Don't speak on your independence.
Knowing you depend on this.
I ain't even used a pen on this.
Anti yeah.
Anti there.
Anti anti.
Woo.
I wonder you gonna fall in love baby.
There's no way we can be friends.
That way girl.
Even if you paid me.
I'm anti friendzone.
And if I don't do you right who's wrong.
Cuz you knew from the beginning what I was on.
Now you reach out social water.
How you expect me not to go crazy.
When you got a body like that baby baby.
Only a fool would not hit that.
We're the perfect mix match.
You can't even trip on that.
Cuz you put your lips on me.
You can tell him whatever you want.
Girl I'm just a homie.
You keep putting those hips on me.
I'm anti and I.
And I'm anti.
How you gonna put those two legs in front of me.
And think I'm not gonna divide.
I'm anti.
Anti.
There's no way we can be friends.
Aw girl.
Get fucked x2.
