Boom Freestyle [Promo] Lyrics
by Vita Et Mors.

I'm the verbal spit smith Wesson.
I unload with Nickel's flow but refill with bullets to sink your chest in.
I'll chop your arms off, smack you and feed them to a stray cat.
So when they call me hands off doesn't mean I'm laid back.
The furthest thing from wack I'll throw some diamonds on your spine Jack.
Cracking on the track bullets flying forward you fly back.
Rhyming with tenacity.
Verbal skills to match Biggie.
Hop in a black civvy to drop a bomb on Rack City.
Lyricism's out, there's no substance only nice features.
Now I get why rap's a bitch; she's so dumb but acts pretty.
In my mind, there's a few ways that you can handle a song.
Make it lyrical, clever, a hot beat and move on.
Way 2: make it meaningful, heartfelt and simpler.
You wanna be great? Do one song using a mixture.
Thirdly: do a concept no ones thought of before.
Couple it with way one and you got yourself an award.
Remain focused; be concise, stop jumping around.
Explore a topic fully, if you can't then quiet your mouth.
I'm close to 20 bars and said more than you could do in 50.
That's just a taste so when it drops you better cop that mixtape.
