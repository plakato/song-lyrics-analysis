Icecold Lyrics
by Voices Of Destiny.

Icecold streams of blood in my veins*.
Trying to save my heart is broken.
In a thousand pieces.
All spread.
On the floor around me.
Coldness from deep inside.
A cruel fist holding tight my mind.
You hear this?
It is so cold that I can hardly breathe.
But I'm breathing your name.
Please help me up again.
Please turn around.
I'm lying there in the cold.
I'm freezing horribly.
Take a step, see my eyes.
Staring deeper into nothingness.
NOTHING'S THERE.
Crying, single tear leaves my eye.
Suddenly all the ground gets iced.
You are walking right beside.
But I slip when I try to follow you.
Please help me up again.
Please turn around.
I'm lying there in the cold.
I'm freezing horribly.
Take a step, hold my hand.
So I can feel you far away.
SO FAR AWAY.
Warmth in your vicinity.
All I fear is to fall back in misery.
Don't you dare.
NO FORGIVENESS FOR COWARDS.
Just Despair.
WHY CAN T YOU SEE ME WINCE UNDER KNIFE.
I pray you know I feel.
Warmth in your vicinity.
All I fear to fall back in misery.
Sun shines into my heart.
