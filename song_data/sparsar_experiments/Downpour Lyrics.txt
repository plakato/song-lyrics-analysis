Downpour Lyrics
by SycAmour.

It goes... Around n round.
It's like the ghosts of my past failures tripped up a carousel.
And it dies... After the park.
Lights stop shadowing the black tops.
The monsters go to sleep and dwell inside.
You're so far.

Tell me that you love me, what I want to hear.
Tell me all the secrets underneath your bed.

I will rip through, every sin to, get what's in you.
Superficial... I won't take, I'll wait till you sleep.
The change is all a game we play Darling.
These chains are all that keeps me tied to my mind, please just.

Tell me that you love me, what I want to hear.
Tell me all the secrets underneath your bed.

I want to feel your bones corrode with mine.
Close to mine.
Grind against you, like I wanna get inside.
Of you.

Ooh, it's just the way that you move, honey.
I don't know what I would do if you were to refuse my love.

Am I alone here?
I've waited all this time, just to let you know.
How I feel. Who I am. What I need.

Oh, and if you've got a thing for control.
You've got me.
Oh, bet you I can make you fall in love.
I'm all in.

Tell me that you love me, what I want to hear.
Tell me all the secrets underneath your bed.

I want to feel your bones corrode with mine.
Close to mine.
Grind against you, like I wanna get inside.
Of you.

When you're dreaming.
When you're sleeping.
My breath collects on the glass outside your window.
What can I do? What I have to.
I won't let you drift away from me.
If I, Can't have, you then nobody else will get the chance.
Paralyzed, All the ice, in my chest can't stop my heart from running dry.

Tell me. That you love me.
