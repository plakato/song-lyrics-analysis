Produkt Lyrics

Gomez.

This is Gotham, after they shot Batman and stabbed Robin.
I mean it's dangerous, I'm just a product.
I'm just a product, I'm just a product.
I mean it's dangerous, I'm just a product.

I'm outside southside Vaughan Road.
Thirsty bitches mouth-wide, dumb hoes.
She just want a drink, I just want something pink.
And that was just a fire-cracker officer that rang out.
Because everybody that I bick it wit' is flamed out.
And that gang headquarters that you told the reporters was here is really just.
a church group hangout.
Praise God, RIP bubbs.
When they say real am I who you think of?
I know a few girls that are down to fuck girls so now it's about where can we.
all link up.
And I be with my boys gettin' paid.
Smokin' on a noise complaint.
Talkin' 'bout ERR ERR EE AH EARLY but meanwhile we always out late.
Never change even on my heyday, gun range 'round here that's a lane way.
Never change even on my heyday, gun range 'round here that's a lane way.
And I don't know what planet I'm on or if I'm coming or going or who's writing.
the song.
But where I'm from we keep it five hunanana.
The VRS peel panties like bananana.
This is what you call an anomaly.
Cause I took it from a hot bowl of hominy.
To seeing this shit work economically.
And all the love is just what the hate promised me.
The sky is gone there is no limit, this world is post-apocalyptic.

This is Gotham, after they shot Batman and stabbed Robin.
I mean it's dangerous, I'm just a product.
I'm just a product, I'm just a product.
I mean it's dangerous, I'm just a product.
X2.

They only hate cause they don't know that taste in your mouth when you go.
broke.
And the Crown still in court bringing up photos, your folks can't make rent.
you don't know those.
Not a pretty sight real big city life.
Not a play-play thing, how you think Fischer Price?
Got a best friend in the federals I gotta write, another one God-willing in.
paradise.
So it's all day all day, in the night at the moon we howling.
As a youngin' on the block; made a wop, ball up, wit' a tall-up lookin' like.
Yao Ming.
Yao Ming stashed in the bush, smoke straight fire tell em dash way the bush.
I see you after what I been had first you should go ask her how I tapped that.
tush.
Root for my people I'm ballin up that ?
We in the street so they swear that we can't be legal.
But why's my name keep calling?
When that game start it's all in or nothing.
The sky is gone there is no limit, this world is post-apocalyptic.
The sky is gone there is no limit, this world is post-apocalyptic.

This is Gotham, after they shot Batman and stabbed Robin.
I mean it's dangerous, I'm just a product.
I'm just a product, I'm just a product.
I mean it's dangerous, I'm just a product.
X2.
