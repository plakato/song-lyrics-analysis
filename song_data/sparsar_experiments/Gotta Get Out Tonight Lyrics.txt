Gotta Get Out Tonight Lyrics
by The Runaways.


In the dead of the night I slip away.
Lookin' for some heavy action.
No matter what it is, I get that little itch.
My body needs satisfaction.

Gotta get out tonite.
The wild one is callin' me.
Gotta get out tonite.
Out on the town is where I'll be alright.

My folks think I'm bad and you know.
They're probably right.
But I don't listen to a thing they say.
But I don't listen to a thing they say.
Cause They're always uptight.

My fantasy is strong, it really turns me on.
I'm gettin' oh so wet.
When will I discover my red hot lover.
The one I'll never forget.

Gotta get out tonite.
The wild one is callin' me.
Gotta get out tonite.
Out on the town is where I'll be alright.
