_Charlie Sloth: Salute Meek Mill_.
Chipmunk: Right, cool, me and Meek Mills. Meek Mill just come home, ya dun.

Interviewer: Do you know any UK rappers?
Meek Mill: I know, Tinie, errm. My man, what's my man with Tip, I got a song.
with him?

Yeah, I'm only gonna do this once.
After that it's straight.
I swear.

Errmmmm, you punk.
I rated you, yeah, let me not front.
I didn't take shots, you're insecure.
Now I hope you're a bulletproof munk.

Don't bred man from my ends, you chump.
Yeah, you're from Tottenham, but man can't see you in T.
That's how I know you're a cunt.
You'll get caned, son, are you dumb?
Skywalker flow, yeah, man will get spun.
Yeah, rows in the alley and man got bunned.
What, you think I do this for fun?
Yeah, it's movie time, grab the popcorn.
Man's unruly like Popcaan.
No Twitter fingers, man pop corn.
Oh, you're grime now, you little pop cunt?
Let's tell the world why you don't like me.
Look what you were into, you doubted me highly.
I gave you a side ting that you went and made your wifey.
How dare you diss Tinie.
You tweeted my label, that's desperate.
Is it cause they dropped you and then signed me?
You went from number one to a diss track.
You're a disgrace to all of us lighties.
Errm, I have to rub my jaw.
You tried to draw man out, are you sure?
I wanna be rich, fuck you and your poor.
Don't take shots if you can't score.
You got my number and you tweeted me.
Where I'm from, that's neeky, G.
Don't run your mouth on the net, then tell the mandem.
That you don't wanna speak to me.
You said I'm not top two in my ends.
You got all of us rubbing our jaws.
Maybe you should think about that.
Cause you ain't even top two in yours.
You're not Skeppy and you're not Wretch.
Maybe I gotta teach you some respect.
Before you talk about me in my ends.
I think you need to pay your debts.
Blud, coming at me ain't smart.
Cuh I'll tip over your Smart car.
Good on the ball, man's Barca.
If you're Gully side then man's Gaza.
Chippy don't run, don't run.
If you leave now, it won't be no fun, no fun.
You could hold one, what you gonna say.
I'm the PD sideman and think that is a straight up par?
Oh you must have thought that I forgot.
You asked me to be in CMAR.
You're just a chief blud, you don't want beef.
You went from Burberry to Ellesse.
Don't think you trickin' man that you like them clothes.
I know you ran out of Ps.
Blud, oh no, oh no, oh no.
I know you took 5 bills for a show.
I'll let it go, the grass is.
green.
Till you play with a pro, don't play with me bro.
You sent for Tinie and he charted.
You sent for Bugzy and he charted.
You sent for Narstie and he charted.
You're the only one that ain't charting, you bastard.
I heard your mixtape, blud it was garbage.
I remember the days when you was an artist.
Now it's all BlukuByeWho and Sonic Boom.
I don't think you know what you started.
I'm out looking for revenge.
You don't want it with me and my team.
I don't wanna hear another diss from you.
Fam, you won't make it to summer '16.
Blud, I don't know why you mentioned my name.
But don't use it for attention again.
I'm not the one, trust me, I'm not the one.
Keep my name out of your childish games.
Man wanna talk about newcomer.
And I can't lie, blud, it's true.
Probably should have been Best Hip-Hop.
But what the fuck's that gotta do with you?
Dickhead.
