Roll Bounce Lyrics
by Switch Floz.


Flips Up hoes down got them woofers in the back like ... 
, 
Switch floz, you bastards, ok, floz! You got it 

Real, nigga section, don't walk by us! 
That'S real bitch, I might just by her 
Lame nigga, get be hind her. She gone say she tire 
I. Smack her ass and pull her hair, she roll it like a tire 
Ain't, nothing change, flips, up, hoes down 
Got them woofers. In back like the dog pound, 
Pulling Hollywood Chuck, Norris 
But, her boy friend, try'na cuff her like an informant 
Fly life, is priceless. 
I know that she deep throat cause she talk with a lisps 
Body super thick like she work at LA Fit 
Tell her exercise, her lips do a pushup on the dick 
 
Real nigga sections, don't walk by us .
 We don't like liars 
All, my trill real nigga, throw the cash up 
All my trill real bitches back that ass up 
Now roll it roll it bounce bounce, 
Now, roll it roll it! Bounce bounce, 
Now, roll it roll it! Bounce, bounce, 
Now, roll it roll it! Bounce bounce 
 
Roll it like weed bounce it on these balls 
Dick, be the key open up all doors. 
Matter fact: ciroc be the key open up: whores 
Demolition man yea, I'm knocking down these walls, 
Lotto G. Bitch, tat it on ya, titties 
I! Dare ya man act up? U see these goons with me! 
Rub these ones on ya, ass drop, n gim me 50 
Roll, it bounce bitch get busy like 
 
Heedi blacc. Now bounce don't talk just bounce 
Ha Milly coming through tell that nigga bring a ounce 
Of that Good-Good dour right now. I'M on that Keisha 
She used to be a good girl, but I turned her to a eater 
Pardon me sorry, bumped into a girl name. Molly 
She had me going crazy, took off my shirt in a party 
Then. I dagger dagger 
And. I told her to bend over 
Just hit it one nightstand and I gave her the cold shoulder now. Bounce
