Roll Bounce Lyrics
by Switch Floz.


Flips Up hoes down  got them woofers in the back like....

Switch floz you bastards! ok floz you got it.

Real nigga section don't walk by us.
That's real bitch, I might just by her.
Lame nigga get be hind her she gone say she tire.
I smack her ass and pull her hair she roll it like a tire.
Ain't nothing change flips up hoes down.
Got them woofers in back like the dog pound.
Pulling Hollywood Chuck Norris.
But her boy friend try'na cuff her like an informant.
Fly - life - is - priceless.
I know that she deep throat cause she talk with a lisps.
Body super thick like she work at LA Fit.
Tell her exercise her lips, do a pushup on the dick.

Real nigga sections, don't walk by us.
we don't like liars.
All my trill real nigga throw the cash up.
All my trill real bitches back that ass up.
Now roll it roll it, bounce, bounce.
Now roll it roll it, bounce, bounce.
Now roll it roll it, bounce, bounce.
Now roll it roll it, bounce, bounce.

Roll it like weed bounce it on these balls.
Dick be the key, open up all doors.
Matter fact ciroc be the key open up whores.
Demolition man yea I'm knocking down these walls.
Lotto G. Bitch tat it on ya titties.
I dare ya man act up u see these goons with me.
Rub these ones on ya ass drop n gimme 50.
Roll it bounce bitch get busy like.

Heedi blacc, Now bounce, don't talk just bounce.
Ha Milly coming through tell that nigga bring a ounce.
Of that Good-Good, dour, right now I'm on that Keisha.
She used to be a good girl but I turned her to a eater.
Pardon me, sorry , bumped into a girl name Molly.
She had me going crazy, took off my shirt in a party.
Then I dagger, dagger.
And I told her to bend over.
Just hit it one nightstand, and I gave her the cold shoulder, now bounce.
