ALLEY CATS Lyrics
by ZIPPO RAIDER.

End of the day.
Just got paid.
Gonna get laid.
No way.
No rest for the wicked.
Assisted suicide.
Fuck that i'm seaside.
Stayin high.
Four-five.
Caliber.
In the alley i lurk.
Watchin the fat rats twerk.
Mic killa puttin in work.
Check my steez.
R-I-P.
Stayin free.
Gotta stop talkin bout me.
Shits hittin the fans.
Spittin sick shit.
Cracked ray bans.
Throw em out to the stands.
Where they land flat.
Only me gotta remember that.
Fuck.

Beat up toyota truck.
Dented.
Bented.
Rented.
Or should i say borrowed.
Owner's sorrow.
When he sees it tomorrow.
Driven down mount kilamanjaro.
Left it at tha bottom.
Of the barrel.
Goin feral on the mic.
So this is what rapping's like.
Deep voice word choice.
Explicit.
For the kids.
Gettin rid of the evidence.
Check my blessedness.
Sike.
Tried to tap.
Told me she's a dyke.
Yeah and i'm from the third fuckin reich.
Bitch.

Still kickin.
Eyes closed throwin elbows.
Through the crowds.
Im rowdy.
Drunk.
Still lookin for some skunk.
Or a bitch to drink my spunk.
Unlock the gun drunk.
Whip out the maverick.
You know where this is goin.
Brains blowin i'm domin.
Heads.
Check my bread.
Bank account in the negatives.
You know you fucks wit this.
Finally got some green i'm blitzed.
Mind foggy still keepin my wits.
Death grips in my headphones.
Im lettin go.
Of reality.
Marinate in my own mentality.
Fuck your nationality.
And your sexuality.
Get over it.
Fuck it.
Police come we all scatter.
So what's the matter?
Gettin showed up by a cracker?
That's fuckin rich.
Stop cryin pick up the mic ya lil bitch.
Fore your fans start to switch.
Zippo raider the rhymin twitch.

Still layin in the ditch.
