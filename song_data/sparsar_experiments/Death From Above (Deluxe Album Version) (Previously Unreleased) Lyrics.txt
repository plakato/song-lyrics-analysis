Death From Above (Deluxe Album Version) (Previously Unreleased) Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Evil's comin' fight the fire.
Push has come to shove.
Let's all pray we need the help.
Death from up above.

We must fight, we won't surrender.
The king will never change.
Hold the line, there's no contender.
The outcome's prearranged.

It's kill or be killed live or let die.
Kill or be killed though you don't know why.
It's kill or be killed rock or let roll.
Kill or be killed burn or save your soul.

Death is certain there's no question.
Life's not quite you see.
Pick your path and make decisions.
For eternity.

Choose your weapons.
This war started long before you came.
Fight the good fight.
Let's be sure they'll never rise again.

It's kill or be killed live or let die.
Kill or be killed though you don't know why.
It's kill or be killed rock or let roll.
Kill or be killed burn or save your soul.

Don't sleep in the fire.
Have faith and desire.
Then fight for your life.
And be free.

It's kill or be killed live or let die.
Kill or be killed though you don't know why.
It's kill or be killed rock or let roll.
Kill or be killed burn or save your soul.

It's kill or be killed live or let die.
Kill or be killed though you don't know why.
It's kill or be killed rock or let roll.
Kill or be killed burn or save your soul.
