Could Be Us Lyrics
by Swazi Jive Entertainment.


Could be us nigga.
Could be me, could be you.
Could be any one of these motherfuckers right here.
Could be him, could be her.
Could be any one of these motherfuckers right here.
Could be us nigga.
Could be us nigga.

Thank God it's me.
Thank God it's us.
Thank jesus piece.
In God we trust.

I, I woke up like this being bro stuff just isn't for me.
No, had told us we don't really want you guys living the dream.
Why, kids gotta be realistic.
Probably never make it.
But I didn't really listen.
Cause I know you miss every single shot if you never take it.
Don't you ever ever ever ever say that I been slept on.
I got stepped on then I stepped up.
Then I crept up then I kept up.
Then I kept on.
And I made it this far.
Gotta thank God.
Call me Kikwa I'm a rap star.
On a rap song never press pause.
And my skin dark.
Ain't nobody else goin' this hard.
