Journal of a Mad Scientist Lyrics
by Worthwhile.

Late one night.
I can balance the elements.
They boil and smoke in the glass.
I knew war was dead.
But the struggle to control.
The very fortress of who I am.
I drink the potion from the flask.
Admire myself in the mirror.
I felt a god in my own skin.
Here to keep me on top of the world.
Free me from the reality I'm in.

I awoke in the morning.
With a smoke-free conscience.
My creation waits upon the shelf.
Double the dose.
So, begins the struggle of man vs self.
My every act, and every thought.
Consumed by this drink.
I would punch through the window.
Impaled-looking grin.
I can barely recognize him.
I've become a stranger in my own skin.

I have an angel on my shoulder.
And a demon on the other.
Whisper in my own ear.
I only hear what I want to hear.
I am my doctor and my patient.
And now my remedy became my enemy.
With the same craving I sought to flee reality.
It seems this high is doing.
The same thing right back to me.

This old medicine has let the demons in.
But there ain't no bottle in all the world.
Like that dear little bottle of mine.

Back alley existence.
What have I become?
A wash up, a has been.
My head hung low in a gutter's puddle.
I saw a monster in my own skin.

I was not consuming something.
Something that was consuming me.
I wish I would've paid consent.
When this all began.
I threw it all away.
I destroyed, didn't create.
Here is the journal of a mad scientist's end.
Here again, as I to lay down the pen.
And proceeded to seal up my confession.
I bring the life of an unhappy man.
To an end.
