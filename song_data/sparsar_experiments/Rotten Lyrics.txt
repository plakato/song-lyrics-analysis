Rotten Lyrics
by Unda Preshur.


She say she love it, she want it, she wanna make me a promise.
She think I'm modest but honestly, i'm an oddity.
Now she constantly follow me, wants to talk to me calling me.
Hot and bothered a goddess, who wants a part of me.

I know she thinking of me, Fall asleep in her dream.
She holds her pillow, like she wish it was me.
I know she thinking of us, She think of falling in love.
She tries to hold me, but I rot into dust.

The feeling of evil Not gon' devour.
Everything about you I got you a flower.
Thinking you can be the one I want to be.
Developing a crush wit, Watch it rot in an hour.

No lust like ours, Matter fact when you think about.
You can tell the love is sour.
Matter fact when you think about, you scratching my back.
With your nails when we f*** for hours.

She want it rough, wanted everything from she wanted love.
Now She Telling me she Wanna be with me every minute of the day is not enough.
Nah. She's B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, Can't you tell.
I'm a demon trapped in a body motherf*** er now it's back to hell.

I bought you roses and chocolates, I know I'm dope and I'm awesome.
A candle lit dinner I'm feeling romantic you blossom.
Under the moonlight, untill the mood strikes, You ain't ever leaving.
Read you poems till the roses grow mold and are rotten.

Watch me open a coffin, I'll leave you broken and awkward.
All I need is a moment to hold cause I lost it.
Your heart is like a balloon I'll poke it and pop it.
I wouldn't hold it and rock it, i'd rather slow it and stop it.

She say she love it, she want it, she wanna make me a promise.
She think I'm modest but honestly, i'm an oddity.
Now she constantly follow me, wants to talk to me calling me.
Hot and bothered a goddess, who wants a part of me.

I know she thinking of me, Fall asleep in her dream.
She holds her pillow, like she wish it was me.
I know she thinking of us, She think of falling in love.
She tries to hold me, but I rot into dust.

She used to be different cute with a ribbon.
Till I gave her my music to listen.
Used to be stupid and wack but I came with a rap.
And a new percision, She was the few.
Who knew I could do it among my pupils.
Who could envision, That i would change her.
Happy to anger, Parents don't know her.
Sadly a stranger.

Having fun like damn, Didn't know she would be.
A one night stand, under my charm under my arm.
Under alarm On my right hand.
She clutching and glaring, Lying together in.
Bed I'm like why the f*** is you starin.
I don't need your love I've had enough of you caring.

Intimate thoughts and the stuff you was sharing.
I don't give a f*** , I just want what's under what you been wearing.
After that night ever day I would duck you, now you say I disgust you.
I don't complain cause I feel no pain I take what I must do.

If I wanted I could keep you undressing, say I'm a demon infesting.
Inside of your dreams I been sleeping and nestin.
So when we meet you would feel a peek of depression, blushing cheeks.
And affection, Look at me in the mirror, see no reflection.

She say she love it, she want it, she wanna make me a promise.
She think I'm modest but honestly, i'm an oddity.
Now she constantly follow me, wants to talk to me calling me.
Hot and bothered a goddess, who wants a part of me.

I know she thinking of me, Fall asleep in her dream.
She holds her pillow, like she wish it was me.
I know she thinking of us, She think of falling in love.
She tries to hold me, but I rot into dust.
