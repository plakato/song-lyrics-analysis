Chonkyfire (Remix) Lyrics
by Oxxy Osbourne.

Differentiate my dream.
Always look outside the box.
Shillouhettes appear into the mirror.
The homie day he told he.
Tazer owner.
You turn the other way.
The blades only get colder at an.
Its sad to see.
Ice skating rink.
Everybody dies one day.
Of weakness at its greatest.
Imma catch you on the block.
So imma get it even when im dead.
Lazy sofa stained sheets.
And if you wanna earn the trust of a taurus.
The screams of every child.
From reality.
The people i love struggle.
So whend i miss the fuckin call.
And make ya whole face bleed.
Bleeding from my empty walls.
The brave solider.
That the boogieman had took away.
You need patience.
Just be you until it stops.
Im goin till i can't.
Aimin over everything.
When i see you on the street.
And lying under rubble.
Listen to the vision that portrayed.
That everyone has ever seen.
Caged stoner play for keeps.
The range rover.
Flipping through the pages of a book.
Changed owner.
When i look away.
And tho it might seem like its trouble.
Symbols from a horror movie.
That i had read today.

Inside the mystic ball.
It said that fear is just a form.
