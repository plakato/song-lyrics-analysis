Good Lookin' Lyrics
by Vitesse.

I like to see the lipstick.
I like the mascara 'round her eyes.
I feel so romantic.
I feel exactly what she likes.

She's freakin' out on glamour.
She might be showin' for a while.
But she'll be tender to your handsome kinky smile.

From the cool and groovy boys.
To the heavy-duty nightclub toys.
Are tryin' to be good lookin'.
Everybody's so good, good lookin'.
From the kids in the disco bars.
To politicians and moviestars.

She likes Marlon Brando.
So much younger than today.
Like Marilyn Monroe.
Who's beauty was bound to stay.

Are tryin' to be good lookin'.
We are on a scene ruled by the graces.
Of colours and shapes.
Good, good lookin'.
