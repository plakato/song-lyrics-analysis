Follow You Lyrics
by Sway UK.


Where do I go, from here?
Feeling so far, from near.
Someone give me a hand.
A hand to hold.
Someone give me a voice to guide me home. Oh.

Plays to her beat, he's living in her drum.
And like a harp on her heart strings he strums.
We're both in love are the words she sung.
But her family ain't hearing her she might as well hum.
She says he's Mr Right they say he's Mr Wrong.
And she replies can't we all get along?
And though she don't agree in the way he makes change.
She believes he's gonna change, and get a job.
He's with his friends saying ‘Catch them young, and their forever yours'.
She's forever indoors.
She was ready to start Uni.
‘till he got down on his two knees.
And made his enemies in-laws.
She's two weeks late. The door goes knock knock.
Police take him away, he gets locked up.
He's caught himself a case.
She's bought herself a test and the suspects the same guy that's left her.
knocked up.
Where does she go?

When your thoughts start sounding like noise.
You're at the crossroads trying to make a choice.
With no shoulder to cry on.
And all you have left is a voice.

Where do I go, from here?
Feeling so far, from near.
Someone give me a hand.
A hand to hold.
Someone give me a voice to guide me home. Oh.

You've got to follow you.
You've got to follow you.
You've got to follow your heart.

You've got to follow you.
You've got to follow you.
You've got to follow your heart.
Heart.

Life is, so short.
He didn't know his Father, and never really talked about it.
Plus he was brought up well.
So unless you brought it up, well, he never really thought about it.
Looking at his own kids, reminds him he ain't got no hate.
And then he had a strange phone call from a sister that he didn't know existed.
‘Is this some kind of prank?'.
‘No wait!' she said.
‘Please, the Father that we share is in a critical condition under care.
I heard stories about you and I know it wasn't fair.
But the fact he wasn't there it doesn't me he doesn't care'.
He's gonna need a donor, at least be assessed.
He agreed to the test and the results came back.
He's a straight match.
But should he take the risk for a stranger that was supposed to play Dad?
Now, where does he go?!

When your thoughts start sounding like noise.
You're at the crossroads trying to make a choice.
With no shoulder to cry on.
And all you have left is a voice.

Where do I go, from here?
Feeling so far, from near.
Someone give me a hand.
A hand to hold.
Someone give me a voice to guide me home. Oh.

You've got to follow you.
You've got to follow you.
You've got to follow your heart.

You've got to follow you.
You've got to follow you.
You've got to follow your heart.
Heart.
