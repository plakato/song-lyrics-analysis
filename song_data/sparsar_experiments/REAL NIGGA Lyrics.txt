REAL NIGGA Lyrics
by 3pac.


Okay! Yeah...

Damn, I'm a real ass nigga.
See her in the club, getting these figures.
Yeah, we in the stripclub.
Suga momma on my dick wanna make love.
Uhh, talking bout big cheeks.
Holding it down for the ZHG, son.
Yeah, you know I'm a king.
Big boss in the game, never skimp.
All my niggas hold in down in the hood.
Bankhead, rather would be me.
Oh you can't, cause you ain't no boss.
You ain't the white Rick Ross.
You gon get tossed, if you fucking with that.
Silvaback on the track son, that's the.
step.
Damn, I'm a one of a kind.
Mastermind son, it's all about the.
design.
Yeah, I'm a real ass nigga.
See me in the Bay getting these figures.
Ughh, counting that bread.
Suga momma gimme 10 racks with some head.
Damn, I'm a real ass boss.
? son, I'm the white Rick Ross.
Stay flossed, get tossed if you fucking with me.
3-P-A-C, living my destiny.
I'm a real ass nigga.
See me in the stripclub getting these figures.
Yeah, bandz a make her rain.
Suga momma on my dick wanna give me brain.
Yeah, I'm a big boss tycoon.
In this game, ? in the afternoon.
Damn son, doing what I wanna, smoking.
marijuana.
Swaggin on my llama, swag like Osama.
Damn, blowing up like a Taliban.
Never gave a damn, yahmmm.
Baby know what's good and baby know I'm winnin'.
Suga momma know what's good from the beginning.

Wuz good, wuz good.
The only white nigga in the hood.
Wuz good, wuz good.
Only white nigga in the hood, son.
Yeah, I'm the only white nigga.
Yeah, and I'm getting these figures.
Yeah, and I'm getting that bread.
Chedda mama gave me 10 racks with some head.
