Crossed Out Name Lyrics
by Ryan Adams And The Cardinals.

Orange sky don't go.
Manhattan looks like someplace else.
Cloudy with a low fog shelf.

Into the crowded streets I go.
Eventually they lead me back home.
Where we used to live.
I live alone and into bed I go.

I wish I could tell you.
Just how I fell.
I don't pray I shower.
And say goodnight to myself.
And when I close my eyes.
I feel like a page.
With a crossed out name.
With a crossed out name.

I kiss her mouth and I know.
For everything there is a word.
For everything but this.

I like the dresses, the shoes.
And the clothes.
And everything you know that goes.
With loving a girl I supposed.

I Wish I could tell you.
Just how I'm hurt.
Pinpoint the location.

And when I close my eyes.
I see a fire so plain.
And my crossed out name.
Crossed-out names.
I see a crossed out name.
I see a crossed out name.
