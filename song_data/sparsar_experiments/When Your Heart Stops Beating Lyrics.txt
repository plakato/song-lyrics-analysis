When Your Heart Stops Beating Lyrics
by +44.


Turn it up I never wanna go home.
I only wanna be part of your breakdown.
She got caught by the four on the floor.
It picked her up and she'll never get let down.
And now I can't stop thinking about it.
All you people at the top don't know nothing about it.
We don't give a fuck what the price is.
So just leave us to our own devices and we'll leave you alone.

I'll be there when your heart stops beating.
I'll be there when your last breath's taken away.
In the dark when there's no one listening.
In the times when we both get carried away.
When we both get carried away.

She says it all without a thought in her head.
She says it all and she's pressed up against me.
A little something just to take off the edge.
A little more and I'll fall of the planet entirely.

When we both get carried away.
When we both get carried away.

When we both get carried away.

When we both get carried away.
