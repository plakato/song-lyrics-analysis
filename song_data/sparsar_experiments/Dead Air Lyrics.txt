Dead Air Lyrics
by Rufus Rex.

The cities are graveyards.
The buildings are crumbling.
The streets are deserted.
The machines are rusting.
Their purpose for living.
Their forgotten makers.
Have ceased to exist.

The roads have grown stagnant.
The lights have all died out.
The death of a nation.
The end of an era.
The people are fading.
Their bones turn to dust.
And return to the ground.

Madness and misery.
Are my dark history.
I replay those scenes.
Over and over and over and over again.

Turned on the radio.
It's no use there's no one left.
A search for life now.
Within the dead air.
Turned on the radio.
It's no use there's no one left.
A search for life now.
Within the dead air.

This earth has grown quiet.
The memories are dying.
The days lose their meaning.
The stillness is frightening.
There soon will come soft rains.
This world will find solace.
Now that it's been cleansed.

Madness and misery.
Are my dark history.
I replay those scenes.
Over and over and over and over again.

Turned on the radio.
It's no use there's no one left.
A search for life now.
Within the dead air.
Turned on the radio.
It's no use there's no one left.
A search for life now.
Within the dead air.

Turned on the radio.
It's no use there's no one left.
A search for life now.
Within the dead air.
Turned on the radio.
It's no use there's no one left.
A search for life now.
Within the dead air.
