All That Matters Lyrics
by Quarta Quarta.


She plays hopscotch on my heartbeat.
She never left it vacant.
Hyperventilation when I smell your fragrance.
It's so amazing.
My parents love you, and I do too.
Love every time you come through.
We watch cartoons, we eat fruit snacks, I love everything you do.
Aye, you know, what to do.
You know the deal. Gem Gang, so for real.
You know what else is real? Everything I tell you when we chill.

Get lost in a conversation, complicated, you know I like you but.
I have to grind to make changes. Aye.

You know that I gotta go.
You know that I wanna stay.
Every second that I'm with you is a blessing to my way.

Love talking to you, cause I know you ain't frontin.
So I wrote this song for you so that must mean something.
Right?

Yeah yeah.
Ain't worried about nobody else.
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself.
You make me complete.
You're all that matters to me.
Yeah, yeah.
What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no I in team.
You make me complete.
You're all that matters to me.

Aye. Let me talk to you.
Every outfit you flossing through.
Don't let the hate go get to you.
Cause you got a point that you gotta prove.
You don't lack motivation, dreams play that part.
Even though you act strong, I can see they broke your heart.
I don't know trigonometry but let me go calculate.
The cosine, of your love, so I can go and heal that break.
If I add that with my love, and my musical placement.
Hope this song is in your playlist and your heart is adjacent.
To mine.

And I know, and I know.
And I know you love me so.

And I know, and I know.
And I know you love me so.
