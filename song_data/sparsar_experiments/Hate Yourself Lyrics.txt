Hate Yourself Lyrics
by X.L..

You was my girl, we had a good thing.
Never thought that things would change.
Cuz you would always say, the only one for you.
Everything was great, the love we made was great.
Never thought I would see the day.
When you would slip away, run off with somebody new.
I tried to understand what I did wrong to make you leave.
But I did the that best I can.
There's no other guy who's gonna love you like I did.
Now you know that I'm doin' good.
Heard the buzz about me blowin' in the hood.
You made a mistake.
You played the wrong man so:.
I won't lose sleep over you.
I will not cry over you.
I won't save no shit from you.
But instead here's what I'll do:.
I'll date every girl I see.
And make sure that you see me.
And you'll regret that you're no longer the one standing next to me.
I won't hate on what you do.
When you find somebody new.
And realize you were a fool.
But instead here's what I'll do:.
Shake my head with such disgrace.
And throw my success in your face.
To be back with me is what you wish.
I'll make you hate yourself for this.
Gonna make you hate yourself.
Regret the fact you ever doubted me.
At times I felt like we would would never ever part.
But I don't really care anymore.
Cuz thinkin' 'bout the things that you did u didn't really care.
Like when I was with that group Code 5.
You used to act like you was by my side.
I trusted, I needed you.
And all you ever did was mess around with my fam.
And talk behind my back.
Damn I really hated that.
But see now you're gonna pay for that.
And live with the fact that we'll never be one again.
Unless I choose to, bitch I'ma be cruel too.
And let you know that I'm the shit.
And that's just somethin' that your gonna have to learn to get used to.

I won't lose sleep over you.
I will not cry over you.
I won't save no shit from you.
But instead here's what I'll do:.
I'll date every girl I see.
And make sure that you see me.
And you'll regret that you're no longer the one standing next to me.
I won't hate on what you do.
When you find somebody new.
And realize you were a fool.
But instead here's what I'll do:.
Shake my head with such disgrace.
And throw my success in your face.
To be back with me is what you wish.
I'll make you hate yourself for this.
Nowadays I gotta change my cell phone number every week.
Cuz somebody's always hittin' my Nextel askin' me whats goin' on with XL.
Mami I know the reason that you reachin' out.
Cuz the secret on the street's been leakin' out.
Heard different people speakin' 'bout XL.
And you seemin' to be left out, oh well.
Don't hate me, you should hate yourself.
Cuz you tried to play me and you played yourself.
And now lately you been feelin' the blues.
You was eager to play the game and ain't know the rules.
Fouled out which means I found out.
You wasn't really ridin' was you?
And now because you, heard that I'm heavy in the streets.
You wantin' me back but uh, it's a wrap for you!
I won't lose sleep over you.
I will not cry over you.
I won't save no shit from you.
But instead here's what I'll do:.
I'll date every girl I see.
And make sure that you see me.
And you'll regret that you're no longer the one standing next to me.
I won't hate on what you do.
When you find somebody new.
And realize you were a fool.
But instead here's what I'll do:.
Shake my head with such disgrace.
And throw my success in your face.
To be back with me is what you wish.
I'll make you hate yourself for this.
It's a wrap.
So what u need to do is.
Take my numbers out your phone.
Don't be callin' my crib no more'.
Don't be tellin' your friends to tell my friends to tell me nothin.
And tell your lil' brother when he see me on the street.
Dont be runnin' up to me givin' me dap and all that cuz we ain't cool like.
that.
Oh yeah, remember that time I told you I loved you?
I LIED!
