Part of Your Scene Lyrics
by Two Inch Astronaut.


I don't wanna be reading about you.
In the paper we saw your tox screen.
I just wanna be in and around you.
Now won't you let me be a part of your scene yet.

How'd I do, how ya think?
If you fucked it up you forgot to believe.
If you're a snitch and you're a fink.
And you look the part then you can join our team.
Hey! Woo! Woo!

I don't wanna be reading about your bad touch.
Your nip tuck or the time you tried to make love.
I just wanna feel you shiver out all your problems.
Cause life's a twitch then you die.

How'd I do, well how ya think?
If you fucked it up you forgot to believe.
If you're a snitch and you're a fink.
And you look the part then you can join our team.
That's right! That's right!
We are calling you.

Is this normal?
I don't know, what do you think?
Consequences being sold.
By someone you don't know.
So they can carry you to the bank.
