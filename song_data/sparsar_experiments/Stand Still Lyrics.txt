Stand Still Lyrics
by Visionaries.


At a standstill, frozen.
Posin' for a portrait, framed with guidance.
Three-pronged like a trident.
Try it in a 'port, report the second hand smoke.
Rumors are contagious.
Some of the things heard are truly outrageous.
Age put the rage in us, who's this pagin' us?
Uphold maintenance to avoid rust.
Simplify competitive complexities.
I beg for forgiveness - please.
We share to uplift this round square.
We're not one, beat the drum without a care.
Don't you dare chat to me in that manner.
Different territory, different type of grammar.
Bond family, no relationship to Bammer.
Number one mover and shaker of a tackle.
You're uneven, you need more spackle.
Bitin' like a jackal, snap, crackle and pop.
Slung herbs to this cop, didn't do it a lot.
Once it's off the lot it depreciates.
Motor mile stop revvin for the pedestrians.
State your full name, answer questions.
Take all this as suggestions.

Days are limited.
Look at life, how you're livin' it.
Got the solution, apply.
Worthless information, lie.

Why fear Armageddon.
When there's eternal life in heaven.
Get that overhaul, get the engine revvin.
Play the wall at the Gavin convention.
Dead-end your ego like vehicle.
People, it's repairable plus fareable.
Elementals terrible.
The only way they'll get five mics from the Source.
Is a t-shirt, be hurt.
Inadvertenly dominary.
Whenever there's a turntable I'ma be heard.
Preferred Visionary, wha-wha-wha-wha.
Got your attention like TV.
I place no value on shock, rock for you to see.
Check the policy, honesty is a rarity.
Include me in a  theory.
Clearly not overnight I  man.
Excellent a walk in the park, Cali accent.
There's always room for improvement.
Done it before they do it.
Do it bits and pieces.
All releases increases.
Canadian currency.
Currently a blessed MC.
