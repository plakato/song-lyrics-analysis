Right After Me Lyrics
by Ry.


I'm exalted like that thing that hold Aladdin feet.
Walk with control like Totalitarian feet.
Grab a beat then scrap and eat.
Grab a beat then scrap eat.
Out of my mind like a bomber that attack for peace.
Some choice words for all who attacking me.
Go drive while you take a nap in a Jeep.
And watch your head smack your fucking feet.
Three things that describe me factually?
Young, Black, and a Beast.
Cluck vegetarian, I stay mixing crack with beats.
Ready for a war, Spike Lee camera couldn't capture me.
Fuck around recording and become Ry's next casualty.
Whether I'm beasting or I'm just going casually.
Factually you know I'm out chasing salaries.

What I like doing? Toe-tagging beats.
Get to flowing, no time for dragging feet.
What I spit hella similar to dragon speech.
My arteries be stashin heat.
I'm a motherfucking beast.
I'm not just flashing teeth.
I'm just last on the leash.
What you doing Ry? Trying to make a masterpiece.
So tell these boys they can get right after me.
Right after me, Right Right After me.

Bout to black out like Charlie Murphy in an Amish home.
At you rhymers who be plainer than an Amish bomb.
In an Amish palm in an Amish Home.
I stay round fire like a motherfucking omelet on.

Or Fleece would if Macaulay Culkin was Home Alone.
In other words these beats getting raped.
By all this heat on a nigga fucking tape.
I'm a greedy thing, I ain't trying to cut no cake.
Evolution never happened cause I'm still a fucking ape.
Disturb the peace when I go Luda on the fucking mic.
Fans think I'm Juanita the way that I be fucking mics.

First night of Biggest Loser, boy ain't nothing light.
And with these bars I should be in a cell for life.
Boy yo pen game as scary as some melting ice.
