Prison Song Lyrics
by Zug Izland.


I can remember, all that she gave to me.
I can remember, how much she hated me.
I can remember, just what she kept from me.
And I remember, all that she left to me.

I can recall it, when the love was gone.
I can recall it, when the pain was strong.
I can recall it, when her palm would flash.
For what seemed like all night the terror would last.

I can remember, the look in my brother's eyes.
I can remember, whats left but another try?
I can remember, the heat in the summer time.
And I remember, all that was never mine.

I can recall it, when the love was gone.
I can recall it, when the pain was strong.
I can recall it, when her palm would flash.
For what seemed like all night the terror would last.

I'm not here tryin to make amends.
Turn back time and I'd kill her again.
It's what I call justifiable sin.
Cock the hammer back!
And I put two in.

I can remember, half her head was gone.
And I remember, it was all over the lawn.
Also remember, the cops were everywhere.
I can remember, I didn't even care.

I can recall it, when the love was gone.
I can recall it, when the pain was strong.
I can recall it, when her palm would flash.
For what seemed like all night the terror would last.

I'm not here tryin to make amends.
Turn back time and I'd kill her again.
It's what I call justifiable sin.
Cock the hammer back!
And I put two in.
I'm not here tryin to make amends.
Turn back time and I'd kill her again.
It's what I call justifiable sin.
Cock the hammer back!
And I put two in.
I'm not here tryin to make amends.
Turn back time and I'd kill her again.
It's what I call justifiable sin.
Cock the hammer back!
And I put two in.
