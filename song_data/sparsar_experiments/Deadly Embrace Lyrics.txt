Deadly Embrace Lyrics
by Voice.

Deep in my dark soul awaits a hidden desire.
The taste of your sweat on my tongue.
Boosts my bloody require.

Which of you can help me.
Can help me through this time.
Through this time of desiring.
Through this time of requiring.

Which of you stands by my side.
Guides me through the night.
Through the night of sensation.
Till the rescuing day of salvation.

Run, run away.
Run away from here.
Look into my greedy eyes.
Feel the touch of death and fear.

I follow the smell.
The smell of your fear.
My embrace burns like fire.
I'm your black angel.
Please call me, my dear.
And follow my dark desire.

Your screams and your sob.
Give me the power.
To be a messenger of hell.

I'll see your naked body.
Garnished with flowers.
This night will teach you to believe.

Not even death.
Can stop me now.
I will rise from the dead again.
And with demonic power.
I create a new kingdom.
Of pain.

Run, run away.
Run away from here.
Look into my greedy eyes.
Feel the touch of death and fear.
Because I claim my sacrifice.

Feel my deadly embrace.
Feel my deadly embrace.
Feel my deadly embrace.

Which of you can help me.
Can help me through this time.
Through this time of desiring.
Through this time of requiring.

Which of you stands by my side.
Guides me through the night.
Through the night of sensation.
Till the rescuing day of salvation.

Run, run away.
Run away from here.
Look into my greedy eyes.
Feel the touch of death and fear.
