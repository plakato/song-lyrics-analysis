Everyday Everynight Lyrics
by Russian Red.

You were travelling really far.
I had to stay in watch the plants. Be sorry.
Miles away and planes apart.
You were discovering a new land, I was lonely.
You were young and I was sad.
I just wanted to be by your side.
Everyday, everynight, no more shall we part.
Everyday, everynight, no more shall we part.

You were dancing in my head.
I played forever Last Year's Man.
I'm sorry.
Keep my trousers, stay in bed and read the good things.
I'm afraid now you're lonely.
You were young and I was sad.
I just wanted to be by your side.
Everyday, everynight, no more shall we part.
Everyday, everynight, no more shall we part.
