Dinner Bells Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

I heard all your reasons.
I heard all your plans.
I have seen the seasons.
Clutched up in your hands.
You're the one eyed feather.
You're the lion's mane.
Swear you've heard the weather.
Calling out your name.
There'll be no more winters.
There'll be no more spring and.
There'll be no more dinner bells.
Left for you to ring.
There'll be no more dinner bells.
Dinner bells to ring.
Maestro learns the music.
Musicians learn to dance.
There'll be no more trumpets.
There'll be no more flutes.
No more clapping hands.
I've heard all your reasons.
I've heard all your plans.
I heard of your treasons.
And I've heard all your pleas.
And I've made friends with the hangman.
So there'll be no more winter.
There'll be no more spring and.
There'll be no more dinner bells.
Left for you to ring.
There'll be no more dinner bells.
Dinner bells to ring.
There'll be no more dinner bells.
Dinner bells to ring.
There'll be no more dinner bells.
Dinner bells to ring.
