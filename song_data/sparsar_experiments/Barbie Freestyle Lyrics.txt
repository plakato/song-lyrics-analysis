Barbie Freestyle Lyrics
by Yung God.

Yung God.
Flip the script make a bitch trick.
Cause I got these pretty tats.
I ain't go to Arizona but Im getting wild cat.
21 Bitches on deck call that shit blackjack.
Get crack like Mick Mack if a nigga try to wild.
Higher than a God.
Nigga I was created by one.
Then I hopped up at the party bitches drippin off my john.
I am Yung God bitch I get head like salons.
Pretty niggas beat the pussy like ba-rumpumpumpum.
Flood the whole world its an Ocean gang party bitch.
Im a grown man I dont play with no Barbie bitches.
Not to diss Nicki Minaj, Niggas know what Im talking about.
Black on black time I blew a Yellowbones brains out.

Yung God.

Niggas throw a party and that shit be deserted.
Nigga I throw a party and that shit be so packed.
Bitch its 12:30 walk in and you know Im strapped.
If I feel contact pop em like a Xanax.
Dress like I trap bitch I got bout 30 taps?
Niggas hating on Yung God I brought PBS back.
Damn my weed wrapped in plastic, swag like magic.
As long as my momma happy I give a fuck about this rap shit.
I'd came in looking perfect like a Barbie.
Kush got me think Im going crazy like Gnarls Barkley.
Bitch suck me up, swallow cum thats a meatjob.
Ocean Gang bitch riding wild yellow bitch mob.
