Condition Critical Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Oh, the tension's mounting.
The pressure starts to show.
All the men in haunting.
Please don't let me go.

Try to free my body.

Try to strap me down.

These will never break me.

Free will to look at me.
Condition critical.
I'm feeling physical.
Condition critical.
Not really cynical.
The bells, they are ringing.
Or is it me in my head?
My nerves are numb understanding.
I'm falling out of bed.

So call it paranoia.

I don't see it that way.

You say that I adore ya.

We're gonna rock the way.
Condition critical.
I'm feeling physical.
Condition critical.
Not really cynical, yeah.
Whips and chains.
Don't feel no pain.
What's so wrong?
I think I'm going out of my head.
Over heels, I can't feel.
No pain only pleasure.
Get me out, take me home.
Can't you see my condition?
Condition.
Condition.
Condition critical, critical.
Condition.
Condition.
Condition critical.
Condition critical.
I'm feeling physical.
Condition critical.
Not really cynical.
Condition critical.
I'm feeling physical.
Condition critical.
Not really cynical.
Condition.
Condition.
Condition critical, critical.
Condition.
Condition.
Condition critical, critical.
Condition.
Condition.
Condition critical, critical.
Condition.
Condition.
Condition critical, critical.
Condition.
Condition.
Condition critical.
The pressure is mounting.
I'm on the critical list, hell.
