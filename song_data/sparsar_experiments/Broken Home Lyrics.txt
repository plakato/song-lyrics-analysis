Broken Home Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


They would yell, they would scream, they were fighting it out.
She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out.
Holding onto a dream.
While she watches these walls fall down.
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down.
Shattered glass like the past, it's a memory now.
Holding onto a dream.
While she watches these walls fall down.

Hey mom, hey dad.
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home.
Who's right, who's wrong.
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there.
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home.

Wrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out.
Made it clear, she's still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls.
Feeling empty, they're vacant now.
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you've fought.
She's a scar, she's the bruising, she's the pain that you brought.
There was life, there was love.
Like a light and it's fading out.

Hey mom, hey dad.
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home.
Who's right, who's wrong.
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there.
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home.

You've gotta let it go, you're losing all your hope.
Nothing left to hold, locked out in the cold.
Your painted memories then washed out all the scenes.
I'm stuck in between a nightmare and lost dreams.

Michael &amp; _All_ &amp; **Calum**.
Hey mom, hey dad.
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home.
_Hey mom, hey dad.
When did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home.
Who's right, who's wrong.
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there.
I'm here alone inside of this broken home_.
**This broken home**.
