Broken Home Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


They would yell they would scream, they were fighting it out. 
She would hope she would pray. She was waiting it out 
Holding onto a dream. 
While. She watches these walls fall down. 
Sharp words like knives. They were cutting her down. 
Shattered glass. Like the past. It'S a memory now 
Holding onto a dream. 
While. She watches these walls fall down.

Hey, mom, hey dad 
When! Did this end 
When? Did you lose your happiness 
I'm here alone? Inside of this broken home, 
Who's right who's, wrong? 
Who really cares 
The fault the blame. The pain's, still there 
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home, 
 
Wrote it down on the walls. She was screaming it out, 
Made it clear she's. Still here are you listening now: 
Just a ghost in the halls: 
Feeling empty they're vacant now 
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you've fought, 
She's a scar, she's the bruising she's, the pain that you brought 
There was life. There was love, 
Like a light and it's fading out. 
 
Hey mom, hey dad 
When. Did this end 
When? Did you lose your happiness 
I'm here alone? Inside of this broken home, 
Who's right who's, wrong, 
Who really cares 
The fault the blame. The pain's, still there 
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home, 
 
You've got ta. Let it go you're, losing all your hope. 
Nothing left to hold locked out in the cold 
Your painted memories, then washed out all the scenes. 
I'M stuck in between a nightmare and lost dreams: 
 
, Michael
