Blood On My Hands Lyrics
by Xandria.

Silver stars in my black night.
Cold as ice but beautiful.
Wandering through broken shadows.
The river of life is all filled with sins.
The water I drink is the blood on my hands.
No-one sees how I'm burning.
No-one feels this yearning.
So come taste this black poison - You never reach this heart.
And forgive my obsession - Something tears me apart.
From myself.
Silver stars in my black night.
Cold as ice but beautiful.
Wandering through broken shadows.
The river of life is all filled with sins.
The water I drink is the blood on my hands.
Waiting for my damnation - your prosecutor's here.
In my own accusation - you can't run from yourself.
Oh we're living these lies all alone.
So come on and throw the stone.
Silver stars in my black night.
Cold as ice but beautiful.
Wandering through broken shadows.
The river of life is all filled with sins.
The water I drink is the blood on my hands.
Pray to the gods I have sold in this game of live and let die.
Pray for my soul in this world to deliver me from my sins.
Pray....
All that's been and all I see now.
Only a ghost of what I called....
Silver stars in my black night.
Cold as ice but beautiful.
Wandering through broken shadows.
The river of life is all filled with sins.
The water I drink is the blood on my hands.
