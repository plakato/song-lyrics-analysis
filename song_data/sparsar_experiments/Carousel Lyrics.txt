Carousel Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Oh what a ride... I can't believe it....
Felt so free... Inside....
A new beginning? Dare I believe it?
My friends advise me to step inside....

She's trapped inside a carousel.
That will spin her 'round and force her right towards the end.
She's in for the ride of her lifetime.
Sadly nothing could ever make her turn while there's still time.

Never looking back she just craves for more and more.

Dancing with the souls that she thought she would never find.

Why should I care to look into the rear view mirror.
When all that view has to offer me is misery?
I've come so far, I've feel so free.
I've been offered a sip of life without the bitter taste of pain.

My reality is flying through the air of my dreams.
Dreams where I am the alpha and the omega.

Stepped into a carousel.
To lift me up and bring me closer to the stars.
I'm in for the ride of my lifetime.
Nothing could ever force me back to the ground.


I'm never going back to the hell I called my life.

Cause now I'm dancing with the friends that I though I would never find.

Let me go now, let me leave your life.
Let me feel free, let me see with own eyes.
I will never be the one you'll love.
You will never be the ones I'll depend upon.
