Supposed To Be Mine Lyrics
by Vivian Green.

No two people on earth is better.
Good luck tryin to find her, I know I'll never find him.
You'll always be the one that got away.
But you left so many traces, I could never escape.

But see we almost made it out of hell.
You were so close we could almost touch the stars.
Baby I can feel your heartbeat.
Your hands all over me.
This is like a bad dream.

Cause you were supposed to be mine.
You were supposed to be mine mine.
Well we ought to get out of hand.
And now we're empty handed.
And we can't go back in time.

You were supposed to be mine.
You were supposed to be mine mine.
Well we ought to get out of hand.
And now we're empty handed.
And we can't get it back again.
We'll never get it back again.

You're with me wherever I go.
Baby we were so incredible, we'll never even get it.
And it's been so long since I've seen your face.
And I wonder what it feel like just to look in those eyes again.

We almost made it out of hell.
You were so close we could almost touch the stars.
Baby I can feel your heartbeat.
Remember you kissing me.
This ain't the way it was supposed to be.

You were supposed to be mine.
You were supposed to be mine mine.
Well we ought to get out of hand.
And now we're empty handed.
And we can't go back in time.

You were supposed to be mine.
You were supposed to be mine mine.
Well we ought to get out of hand.
And now we're empty handed.
And we can't get it back again.
We'll never get it back again.

I used to try to erase it.
But it never worked baby.
Cause how could I erase a part of me?
You used to be the air I breathe.
And I still dream that you're here with me.
Every night I got to sleep.
Nobody can understand.
They all tell me to let go.
But what's between two lovers only they know.
So I hold you in a place where our love, it remains.
And it's never gonna change.

You were supposed to be mine.
You were supposed to be mine mine.
Well we ought to get out of hand.
And now we're empty handed.
And we can't go back in time.

You were supposed to be mine.
You were supposed to be mine mine.
Well we ought to get out of hand.
And now we're empty handed.
And we can't get it back again.
We'll never get it back again.

You were supposed to be mine.
You were supposed to be mine mine.
Well we ought to get out of hand.
And now we're empty handed.
And we can't go back in time.

You were supposed to be mine.
You were supposed to be mine mine.
Well we ought to get out of hand.
And now we're empty handed.
And we can't get it back again.
We'll never get it back again.
