Livin-N-Hell Lyrics
by The Union.


Sticky Fingaz.
I'm from New York nigga, the murder capital.
Come in my hood wearin the wrong shit, they might cap you.
I'm a sinner, I hope God forgive me.
At the rate I'm goin now my moms'll probably out-live me.
All my niggas is hardcore criminals.
All I got left is my word and my genitals.
I'm on some thug shit till I get cremated.
Me and Larry Davis probably related.
I hate the judge and can't stand the cops.
Wanna dump on them pigs till my hands get hot.
You wanna KILL ME? I ain't scared to get smoked.
I'll probably die laughin, cuz y'all niggas is jokes WHAT!
I wanna wrap my hands around your throat WHAT!
I'll make Ted Bundy look like the pope.
I show no love cuz I ain't got no feelings.
You know the routine, reach for the ceiling.
And if not for you, do it for your child's sake, nigga.
I'll get you murdered then come to your wake.
I speak in four-letter words, my rhymes is curse.

Holdin court in the streets, I ain't doin a bid.
I'd rather die, put that on my unborn kid.
There's two ways out the game, death or jail.
If there's a God, then WHY THE FUCK I'M LIVIN IN HELL?

There's two ways out the game, death or jail.
If there's a God, then why He got us livin in hell.

X-1.
X-1'll blast five  through the back of your neck.
Out your mouth, I'll bet that'll straighten you out.
Live shit is the realest shit of all subjects.
And I love wreck, put the pressure on any suspect.
Life tactics is all I spit in my rap shit.
Most y'all cats is wack and need practice.
Get burned to ashes, spit on your casket.
It's mad sick, drastic, it don't get no harder than this.
Squeezin hard for the chips.
More bricks, the larger the wrist but that's the fun of it.
Every car hidden got a gun in it, I'm tryin to get mine.
Get out and run wit it, kid extort your block.
Unorthodox, this is all off the top.
X-1'll throw you off the docks.
And I done laid the best to rest over this music.
Half y'all niggas is S-O-S WHAT.
Stuck On Stupid.

Blaze.
Slugs I send express, take it to your face and chest.
Digest gun smoke, don't provoke finger in trigger.
Been love sick, gat throw like ugly.
Mister thug clip, biggest the slugs hit.
One of you bugs better maintain.
I claim you got game, drown you in a lake of octane.
Never miss when I cock the four-fifth.
Stain your garments, hit any target.
From New York to Cali, I leave you fucked up in a back alley.
Swell you up and bury your heart.
Shells won't stop fallin, once they start blocks spark.
It's trouble, rippin your parts, for your flesh bubble.
Hell cuddles my life line in this trife time.
Bust shots, live nines.
Drive mines crazy like V-J Day.
Live life the PJ way, it's D-Day.
When A &amp; A sprays.
Travelin, like a heat-seekin javelin.
Blaze slays rivals when battlin.
