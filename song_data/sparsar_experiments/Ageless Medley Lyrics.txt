Ageless Medley Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Are you living in an old man's rubble, 
Listening to the father of lies 
If, you are then you're headed for trouble. 
Listen too long you'll eventually die 
 
Too late for walking in the middle 
Too late to try 
And it's too late for sitting in the balance. 
No, more middle line, 
 
Are, you puzzled by the way that you're behaving 
You, wonder why you do the things you do. 
Are you troubled by your lack of resistance. 
It feels like something's got a hold on you, 
 
Are, you living in an old man's rubble. 
Listening to the father of lies: 
If, you are then you're headed for trouble. 
If, you listen too long. You'Ll eventually die 
 
When, I'm losing my sense of direction. 
And, I'm needing some strength and protection. 
Walking away with You. 
I go walking away with You and when I 
When, I think I can't stand any longer. 
And, I'm crying for someone. That'S stronger, 
Walking away with You! 
I go walking away with You! 
 
El Shaddai El Shaddai, 
El-Elyon na Adonai, 
Age to age You're. Still the same! 
By the power of the name, 
 
El, Shaddai El Shaddai 
Erkamka na Adonai 
I, will praise and lift You high 
El Shaddai 
 
I'm gon na fly 
No. One knows where 
But I'm gon na fly 
I'm lighter than air 
 
And, I'm gon na fly 
No. One knows where 
But I'm gon na fly 
And soar through the air 
 
Cause. I have felt for the first time. 
I can be myself 
No more faces to hide behind 
Just a smile, 
And, a dream: that's mine, 
Even! If I am 
The, only one 
Who wants to fly. ... 
 
I may not be every mother's dream for her little girl 
And my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world. 
But, that's all right. As long as I can have one wish. I pray 
When people look inside my life. I want to hear them say: 
 
She's got her father's eyes, 
Her father's eyes, 
Her father's eyes, ya, know 
Just, like my father's eyes, ... 
 
Sing your praise to the Lord 
Come on everybody, 
Stand up and sing .... One more 
Hallelujah 
Give, your praise to the Lord 
I can never tell you 
Just how much good ... that it's 
 Gon na do ya 
Just to sing sing, sing, ... 
 
Come on sii-hii-yiing 
You know you really got ta sii-hii-yiing 
Come on sii-hii-yiing 
 
I have Decided 
I'm gon na live, like I believer 
Turn, my back on the deceiver 
I'm gon na live what I believe 
I have decided. 
Being good is just a fable. 
I just can't cause I'm not able 
I'm gon na leave it to the Lord 
 
Sing. Your praise to the Lord 
Come on everybody 
Stand up and sing ... one more 
Hallelujah 
Give. Your praise to the Lord 
I can never tell you 
Just how much good ... that it's 
 Gon na do ya, 
Just to sing sing, sing, 
 
Come on sii-hii-yiing 
We've. All got ta sii-hii-yiiiiiing 
Come on sing sing, sing,
