Mama I've Been Cryin' Lyrics
by Two-9.


Mama I've been cryin.
These women and these drugs are just a part of all my lyin.
From a big city, uh they can't tame a lion.
Blunts for my confidence that's why I'm defiant.
No it ain't no tryin'.
I've been high for weeks.
Party super hard.
Emotions for the weak.
What the fuck is sleep.
Movin really really fast never really wonder when me and this stripper gon.
leave hey.

Mama I've been cryin.

And I wonder why this shit burn this slow.
Hand on that motherfuckin pistol yea.
Thinkin about it and all but I ain't willing for all in my damn wrist tho.
Yea mama I've been cryin.
And I let these women get to me but mama I've been tryin really not to.
It's hard when they always tryna plot to.
Yeah you got to keep your eyes open for them people tryna stop you uh.
Workin' really really hard never wonder when me and my brothers keep her goin.
mean.

Mama I've been cryin.

Mother I've been weepin'.
Smokin' marijuana so I struggle with my breathing.
All these fuckin drugs now I struggle with my sleeping.
Same shit every evening.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know who I'm being.
All these fucking flashlights, I don't know what I'm seeing.
Help me ma I'm bleeding.
Emotions are-a-fleein'.
And my main bitch ain't speakin.
I think my heart stopped beatin.
And I just might die.

Mama I've Been Cryin.

Mama I been cryin'.
To make you proud I really been tryin.
Dyin to make this change.
Let's get high, make it rain.
I'm starting to see the seams on these puppets.
Puppies, but me? Pissed on tree? That's crazy.
My days are starting to blend together.
Mixed with vodka no umbrella.
Intoxicated, these toxins keep me level headed.
Shirley worried little.
? maybe strong minded.
While they brittle by the window.
They in the middle, They in the middle.

Mama I've been cryin.
