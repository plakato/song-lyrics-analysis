Ahh Hell Nah Lyrics
by 3LW.


Woke up.
Couldn't hardly sleep cause it was Xmas.
Ran downstairs to open gifts up.
Could it be the Fendi bag that I want, that I want?

Don't sound like a Fendi to me.
Tore it open and what did I see?

What the hell is this? This ain't what I asked for.
What the hell is that?

Yo I'm getting pissed cause everything is crap.
I'm about to take it back, I'm about to take it back.

Ahh Hell Nah.
Santa you best to get at me.
Ahh Hell Nah.
Xmas ain't what it used to be.
Ahh Hell Nah.
Can't believe you did this to me.
Ahh Hell Nah.
This ain't no Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Xmas.

My man, came to the door.
My gift in his hand.
We been going out for four or five months.
I know he gonna give me just what I want, what I want.

It sounds just like a Fendi bag to me.
Tore it open and what did I see?

What the hell is this? I can't believe you took it there.
What the hell is that?

Yo I'm getting pissed cause everything is crap.
I'm about to take it back.

Fa-la-la-la-la Fa-la-la-la-la Fa-la-la-la-la.
This ain't no Fa-la-la-la-la Xmas.
No Fa-la-la-la-la Xmas.
Fa-la-la-la-la Fa-la-la-la-la Fa-la-la-la-la.
This ain't no Fa-la-la-la-la Xmas.
No Fa-la-la-la-la Xmas.
What the hell is this? Now you've gone really far.
What the hell is that?

Where's the dvds?!
Everything is crap, everything is crap, everything is crap.
