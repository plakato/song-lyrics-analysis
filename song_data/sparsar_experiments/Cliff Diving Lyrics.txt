Cliff Diving Lyrics
by +44.


Hey silly girl, I think I got a thing.
for you.
From late nights spent driving in this stolen car.
The years we wasted living in this desert town.
Haven't broken us so far.
Hot afternoons we climbed onto the neighbor's house.
Breathed deep and jumped into a waiting sky.
Our bare feet were framed on the horizon.
I felt the future in your eyes.

It was the promise of summer.
We sealed it with a kiss.
This time I'll do things proper.
How did it get to this?

Dear you, tonight lets get ahead of ourselves.
Cause now, I barely can remember.
Yesterday stretched on for so long.
Tomorrow feels like forever.
My God, you know how much I needed this.
These days are filled with such disaster.
Sometimes I think that life will never be the same.
Sometimes I think that's the answer.

And she said.

Here comes the promise of summer.

Here comes the promise of summer.
How did we get to this?
