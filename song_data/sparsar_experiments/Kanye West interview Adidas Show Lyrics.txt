Kanye West interview Adidas Show Lyrics
by Vogue.

**Andr√© Leon Talley:** Congratulations! Really.

**Kanye West:** Thank you, thank you very much.

**ATL:** So tell us, what were the challenges of doing this collection with Adidas, what were the big challenges?

**KW:** I mean, we broke a lot of the previous ways that they would go about working on things. This became about the technology and the recourses and they become more of an LVMH or a Karing Group can then being about the logo. And they really supported me as a creative to get across a real vision.

**ATL:** So how do you feel after the Grammys when you have had this wonderful performance and then you prank the stage, and then you were standing there with you wife and you're letting people know that Beyonce should have gotten the award instead of Beck? How do you feel when you make these pronouncements that become viral, and go viral immediately?

**KW:** I feel good, I feel like a human being, I feel like a man. A man can make mistakes, a man can have an opinion, a man can be hypocritical. But you know, I feel like I have blood in my veins. That my blood hasn't been turned cold by the concept of celebrity or missed opportunities or perception.

**ATL:** Beck said you're a genius and I think you're a genius too. What's going on, would you like to see Taylor Swift wearing some of your Adidas?

**KW:** Yeah, I think she was supposed to be here today but I don't know what happened. I'd like to everyone wearing everything - I'd like to see everyone wearing nothin'!
