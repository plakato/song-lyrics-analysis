Baller Please Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


I wanna be, a baller please.
But the bitches and the liquor, keep on calling me.

Z-Ro.
I wonder if I'm blessed, cause I'm still here.
And I wonder if heaven's any different, cause in hell the blood spill hits.
Got a nigga, fiending for his last breath.
Too many of my partnas beneath me, because a bitch made nigga blasted.
Too many features in songs, tell me why I ain't got no home.
Penitentiary grown, cause I roam with a pocket full of stones.
I wanna live my life, but my life ain't worth the living.
Cause while I'm dreaming about a Benz, even a houpe ain't driven.
Headed for prison, but mama I'm alright with that.
Strapped down with a shank in my tank, hit niggas all night with that.
And it ain't no love left, fuck all of my foes and friends.
Motherfuckers don't fuck with Ro, unless that nigga be rolling in ends.
I need to wake up, instead of day dreaming about holding a slab.
Like being in love with a woman, that you could never have.
Witness the feeling punished by pain, looking for shelter from the rain.
People like W double O-D, I'm going against the grain.
Hey to my niggas in Ridgemont 4, y'all can kiss my ass.
Anybody who ever said they was down with me, can kiss my ass.
I done dumped on motherfuckers, what they gon do for me.
Out of town on stage, nobody from the hood in the crowd to root for me.
Suppose to be my people, but I think my people is the devil.
Fuck my peers, cause I'm on another level.
On my knees, screaming Jesus can you save me.
My shit's so fucked up, I wonder if you thought about me lately.
And it hurt so deep a nigga can't sleep, making me late night creep.
Suicidal thoughts I think I'm ready, plus it's fucking with me.
Would I be missed by these bitch niggas, these fakes and frauds.
Fiending for baby, cause she know she got my heart.
Even though it's torn apart, it's pumping out nothing but love for you.
And to my niggas keep your disses, I got slugs for you.
I shed blood for you, but I'm not appreciated.
The only nigga, that never hesitated.
And it ain't more, hollering out my roll dog's name on tape.
Unless it's fuck you, and in front of it followed up by a K.
No more, hollering out my roll dog's name on tape.
Unless it's fuck you, and in front of it followed up by a K bitch.

Big T.
Balling out of control, sitting swoll on 4's.
Paint so wet, that my clothes stick to the do'.
Oh no, it's Big T.

On a muddy cup, man hol' up.
And if your bitch choose, then you shit out of luck.
I'ma send her ass home, broke and well fucked.
And she kinda walk funny, cause the bitch was well stuck.
When I ain't have shit, y'all boys talk down.
Like you didn't know T, everytime I came around.
Now when you hear me, I'ma put you on stall.
And don't say nothing, when you see me in the mall.
I gotta get my cash, in these H-Town streets.
Presidential Records, and your boy Big T.
I know I gotta get it, cause I wanna be a baller please.
But the bitches and the liquor, keep on calling me yeah.
