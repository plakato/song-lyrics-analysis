Doin' that shit for Rap-A-Lot 
So grap your gat a lot nigga 
Young niggas on the rise, motherfucker

Get'em, get'em get'em, 
 
Nigga. This is war. 
We get the shit together right now: nigga 
After midnight 
This full pound gon' make some sound nigga 
Kick in the door 
I throw your wife on the couch 
I put my dick in her mouth 
And. Put that shit in and out 
Outlaw. No doubt 
Ha what you don't talk, some shit 
Ha. What make Napolean flip 
I blow your 
Backbone to your motherfuckin' lap, hoes 
If, you wig it I'ma! Take it down! 
Who! Do you got ta stay low 
Ha make a move, nigga 
When your sure, improved nigga, 
Outlaw soldier 
Take it to school, nigga, 
We, rule nigga 
Have, it 
Will rap about your gat or won't you grab it 
Feelin' hot, like a weapon. 
Gettin' 16 for my automatic 
Thugged out to the overdoses 
You niggas got to sell'em some shit 
You, probably thought you could leave quick 
It ain't, happenin', bitch, 
It's hard to get mob on mine 
Outlawz my spine 
It ain't hard to find 
But, get ya and lay low 
And get ya pis by the dough 
I. Keep my shit on cock cause. Makaveli said so. 
I keep my shit on cock cause. Makaveli said so: 
 
All 
If, you 
E.D.I. Mean 
Got to get your money on 
From night till mo' 
You, better 
All 
Then do yo thug thang 
If, you 
Yukmouth, 
Buy Chronic by the zone. 
Then get yo smoke on 
All 
Then do yo thug thang 
If, you 
Young, Noble, 
Resign, the streets 
Because, you love to bang. 
All 
Then do yo thug thang 
If, you 
Napolean 
Don't, give a fuck about life. 
I lost my family twice: 
So I'ma 
All 
Then. Do you thug thang 
 
I been what is know as a bandit 
You, better hand it over 
If. You wan na see your grandkids 
I, don't give a fuck 
Cause Makaveli planned it 
But when it's said and done 
In the streets 
We can handle it. 
Do yo thug thang, o really 
You. Don'T wan na see me silly 
With, fully loaded 9 milli, 
When it get to spittin' 
You gon be sittin' me 
I'm makin', you ass history, 
I'm the epidemy of everthing. You fear 
Crystal, clear 
Pistol. There 
In the air 
I hit. You there 
Hit you there 
Then, I'm out of here. 
With your Cartier 
And, your hottie head, 
Between knees 
I got on the clean knees. 
You ain't see no 
Thugs like these 
With slugs, like these 
We rush tightly 
All in together, now 
Makin' it mo better. Now 
Layin' competitors down 
Ahead of you now 
Superial style, 
Grand imperial thug world 
I'm rougher for rhyme 
I. Had you wanted for mine 
While, I'm gunnin' for mines, 
Thought. It was gone but still on 
We commin' to town 
You, rainin', clickin', niggas 
That will see us man 
But. If you think 
You can't do yo thug thang nigga, 
, 
Interlude, Yukmouth, 
 
Fuck, You 
Fuck, the Outlawz 
Fuck the Regime, 
NIGGA 
 
If, you ain't 
Lovin'. This thug shit 
You, must be a bitch 
Can't compete with the bricks 
All. The drugdealers rich 
Or try to get in 
Try to hustle and pear 
Walkin' up and down block all day 
'till the rest of the fiends get here. 
A bitch named Tarifa, 
She owned 300 thugs, 
On a nigga to hold her beaver 
From the blow I fronted. 
And do yo thug, thang, 
Rappin and fightin' drugs. Slang 
I can blast you with one hand and have you 
Losin' your brain 
Abusin', the game 
So now you're. In danger 
Lyrically, I ruin your name. 
And keep one in the chamber: 
Nasty new street slugger 
Catch you with a boxcutter 
Used to fight with my brother 
And run the spot with my mother 
You, get after ask her quick, 
And shit blast the bitch 
Fuckin' around with this Outlaw shit, 
 
All 
Get your Thug on niggas 
Ha then do yo thug thing. 
 
Niggas used to hit me up 
Till. They see that fuckin' Regime. 
Stick me up up in the sky. 
Firebreatin' dragon 
Niggas bout to die, 
Niggas feel like Armageddon 
When I be headin'. 
And wait niggas up at they own wedding 
With. They own weapons, 
Counterfessons 
Ghetto lesson number one: 
Never try to go to war. Without your gun, 
Niggas get done. 
Since I quit fuckin' with Num 
I did once like Big Pun, 
Off the books 
Have your body in a coffin up 

Like, a phoneless chuck, 
That, burned out 
Thugged out and turned out 
Set that motherfucking perm out your head, 
Niggas dead, 
If you ain't Regime or Outlaw 
Kiss the ring 
I do my thug thing without y'all 
Matter of fact, 
I gives a fuck about y'all 
Put, a nigga up in a ho 
Just like a ground hole. 
Thanks of the Hounddogg 
They finally found y'all 
Leavin' on your face. 
And about 12 motherfuckin' bodies, 
Hangin' around y'all 
I, do my thug thang 
Dopin' in and out of lanes 
And. I must thank 
 
Tats on my arm. 
I better ring the fuckin' alarm. 
Or be the first that get mashed on 
Nigga do yo thug thang, 
, 
Napolean, 
Uhhh
