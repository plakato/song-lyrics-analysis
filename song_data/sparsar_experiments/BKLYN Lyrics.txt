BKLYN Lyrics
by Ruste Juxx & Stone Tone.


Yeah.
Ruste Juxx nigga.
Crown Heights.

Ay yo, B-K-L-Y-N we back at it, Juxx break beats up and leaves the track.
shattered.
Glock 40, since a shorty I was dumping off, cuz Crown Heights keeps that.
bullshit jumping off.
Back block murderers, pumping on that side strip, come through stunting get.
your windows and your ride hit.
M.O.P. ‘Ante up' that's the hood anthem, get your moms kidnapped, pay a heavy.
ransom.
Grew up on that Big Daddy Kane ‘Smooth Operator', toting illegal desert eagle.
just to pop a hater.
My Boot Camp niggas Brownsville repping, with hollow tips slugs flying out of.
steel weapons.
Biggie was my idol, Bed-Stuy fly nigga, still kill shit when there's beef,.
ready to die nigga.
Put your body where they'll never find y'all, I'm from Kingston Ave, just.
thought I'd remind y'all, Brooklyn.

Ay yo Brooklyn rule the world, every man, woman, boy and girl.
Know when they see them niggas turning it out.
They know that Brooklyn in the motherfucking house.
Ay yo Brooklyn rule the world, every man, woman, boy and girl.
Know when they see them niggas turning it out.
They know that Brooklyn in the motherfucking house.

B-K-L-Y-N we back at it, killing competition when clicking the blackmatic.
Bushwick to Flatbush niggas take bread, shooting up your funeral and leave.
your wake red.
Dip on the po-nine burning a big blunt, another black male in jail, that's.
what them pigs want.
I do it how I do it, so evil it look legal, my shit's so dope, got fiends, I.

Crown Heights king, Juxx's name ring, you ain't make it nowhere cuz you doing.
the same thing.
Nothing, playing with yourself, you a bitch, talking gossip and shit, you.
ain't tryna get rich.
Yeah, make me have to dig another ditch, Brooknam soldier, I fire on a snitch.

Brooklyn baby.

Ay yo Brooklyn rule the world, every man woman boy and girl.
Know when they see them niggas turning it out.
They know that Brooklyn in the motherfucking house.
Ay yo Brooklyn rule the world, every man woman boy and girl.
Know when they see them niggas turning it out.
They know that Brooklyn in the motherfucking house, yeah.
