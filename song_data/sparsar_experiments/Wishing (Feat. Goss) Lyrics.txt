Wishing (Feat. Goss) Lyrics

Wishing.
Produced by Vo-Kal.

Wishing that you.
Were here by my side.
Praying for these.
Feelings to subside.
Everything was going too right.
Now our future is gone.
For us I would fight.
Another day of you in my arms.

You held me down.
Far beneath the truth.
Could you decide.
What's best for me and you.
And how I feel.
Is slowly losing potential.
Cause now.
Your all I ever wanted.
I can't see myself enduring any longer.
My ropes are thin and yours just seem to be getting stronger.
Got me sippin'.
Now I'm faded.
Off into the distance.
Screaming fuck.
The bitches.
That be trying to diss us.
Then I feel the pain.
That make it hard to listen.
And the grief comes back.
And I just picture us kissing.

Promises were made the ones you shattered girl.
I was tore apart.
I never let you down.
You told me not to fall in love.
It wouldn't matter girl.
Cause you stole my heart.
And then you let me drown.
The warning wasn't enough for me to.
Make better choices with my soul.
Gave it to the devil in the high heel Jim Choo's.
Swear I can't hold it together anymore.
I can't see myself enduring any longer.
My ropes are thin and yours just seem to be getting stronger.
And I'm yelling Carpe Diem.
As I'm rounding those turns.
Fuck Yolo, dead poet.
What I'll be I just can't learn.
From these bitches.
That just use me.
For the moment and then burn.
My life inside a swisher.
With the rest of their concerns.

This happened a year ago.
I remember this clearly.
You said you never failed school.
How the fuck did you fail me.
I reminisce about good times.
Here's one of those moments.
Well I finally gave up.
On you but I can't stop smoking.
Whoa this.
Girl is poison.
My mind is slowly boasting.
Thanks to you.
And I can't stop showing.
My talent off and it's golden.
Holding onto my life.
You say you'd be my wife.
I knew I died in my sleep when it all happened that night.
It all happened so fast.
I wish I never trusted you.
It's clear you are the fucking same.
Back when I first met you.
Second time drinking.
I told her we were fucking.
Sure enough I was fucking.
Easy pussy is nothing.
Slowed down on my music.
A dumb mistake cause I was clueless.
To the subtleties and the one with me.
Was fake stupid the rudest.
No that's not music.
Your tats look like sewage.
Need a say more.
Fuck yea lets do this.
I go in like twins that's nothing to me.
Mistakes are born cause this lifestyles not free.
You clapping your hands cause I'm riding the beat.
I wish you were here but you wish you were me.
Now ain't that some shit.
Sayonara C'est la vie.
I wish you the best but the best is just me.
My life is a movie.
Hers is like the musical.
If I died today nobody came to the funeral.
