Blow The Whistle Lyrics
by Sway UK.


Post World Cup.
I think it's time.
I wake the whole world up.
Across the internet.
I'm no Joe Blogs.
But you can leave a post.
And let me your know your thoughts.
Everybody Sway's back game on.
Got my act together.
Look black James Bond.
I know I can't sing.
But if N-Dubz pencilled me in for a lesson I'd be the black James Blunt.

Yeah black shades on.
Going across the pond.
To bring it back Jay Sean.
‘Cause I'm in Miami bitch.
Looking through international rap.
But the section only had Drake Songs.
I straight chase blondes.
Call me Hudson forever.
Cos the face stays young.
Hung like Parliament.
More chicks than dixy.
They looking like a bunch.
Of Pixie Lotts blame Akon.

Blow The Whistle.
Blow The whistle.
Sway says Blow The Whistle.
It's all about Dcypha.

What happened to the guitar bands?
They just disappeared like Tarzan.
Left the lane clear for Urban and Dance fans.
And now rappers are blowing up like brass bands.
A big look we worked hard man.
But I'm a Bigfoot beast.
I need half man.
A bad boy like Skepta.
With a Tinie Tempah.
If you ain't got the balls to tackle me then pass man.
Dizzee's got hit's coming out of his arse man.
The Dirty Stank must follow him to the loo.
Like are you gonna do a number 1 or number 2?
Whatever he's eating shit.
I wanna eat too.
But I take my Tinchy Strides and.
I never tag along and I've been around scars like my name's Savlon.
And I'm tryna play it cool.
Till my picture is in the Sun.
Like Taio Cruz.
It's hard with this leather jacket on.

I'm like Roll Deep.
People have heard of me.
But they don't know what I look like, surgery.
My album is Flawless.
If I don't get a mercury.
Then I'm a flip.
Like the little kid in Diversity.

Promoters they know what's up.
If you ain't hollered at Coda.
Then I ain't showing up know.
‘Cause I when I do gigs.
I want it packed like Giggs.
All the cats dragged in.
By two, Noah's Arch.
Gonna baff them like a Bafta.
When I got up the charts like.
4321 Noel Clarke like.
Sway was a Blur.
They kept me out like Park Life.
Wireless I'll catch them.
At the park where they can't hide.
Wanna act like I'm forgotten?
Without the arms I rob them.
I turn them into Fugatives.
And make Example's of them.
Then I killed the devil in me.
I'm ready to switch to Plan B.
Turn into Professor Green.
And take samples of them.
Sway Abuze T and some cargo bottoms.
I'm looking Bonkers in the Van.
Throwing almonds on them.
I'm like go nuts.
And I ain't stopping.
Till the venues are filled so much.
They put farmers on them.
I'm Jonathan Ross.
I talk to all the world.
My team Pop Bottles.
And pour it on the girls.
Ironik when I started.
Chippy was a Tiny Dancer.

Now he's a grown up artist.
And he's drawing on himself.
