High Horses Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

There's a light inside us all.
It only shines as bright as we are.
And you're falling down so low.
And we're worried for you.
And we're worried....

But even on our worst days.
We were never quite like this.
We've gone as far as we can go.
Without crashing.
No.

At the heart of every fool.
Is the hopeless, stupid tune.
And there's this lingering, this ignorant feeling.
That I'm just a fool.
That I can see something.

But even at your worst day.
You were never bad as this.
You've gone far as you can go.
Without dying.

Come down off your high horses and let me in.
Come down off your high horses and let us in.
