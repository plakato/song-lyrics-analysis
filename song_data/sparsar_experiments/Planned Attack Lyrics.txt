Planned Attack Lyrics
by Quasimoto.


While we hit you with another one of them old phenomenal shits.

Lord Quas in.
the place, master race MCs.
Coming through like Thelonious Monk.
Madlib drop the horniest funk.
I'll leave you sunken like a crackhead's ass.
Drop the math on that ass fast.
Cause if we battle your whole crew will be coming up in last.
Place, I hit you with a slow.
or fast pace.
Unconceptual mold, new breed to wreck the whole space.
We'll take you out, lacerate cause you was blind.

Ayo, are you the one? And are you the one?
That took that nigga's life without using a gun.

Filthy from the ground on up.
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready.

Y'all niggas sham like y'all rolling on weight.
Your masquerade is hypocritical, y'all heading for fate.
Making the rap game look pitiful.
If it was up to me we would get rid of y'all.
Put a lid on all y'all fake ass niggas contradicting.

But when I drop my shit it's like I put my dick in.
The snare kicking, Madlib rush through thinking.

Now watch the plot thicken.
I shut my ears while you run the lip service.
On purpose and get nervous.
cause I'm about to serve this.
