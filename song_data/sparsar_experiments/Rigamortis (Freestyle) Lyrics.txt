Rigamortis (Freestyle) Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.

This that beast coast, 
Baltimore shit, G. 
Home of the Wire where we never play the fifty 
Niggas know I get money. That'S word to fifty 
I'm, a NWA so killing this shit is 
EAZY. E 
That's. What ya girl pop when I'm wit, er. 
I smashed her 
Now? All you do is twatch me on twitter, 
I travel to see different currencies, 
Ima hot SPITTA 
When, I'm on that # jetlife. You rappers need a fucking SITTER 
But fuck it its time to takeoff 
Better, yet blastoff 
Ayee NASA 
I'm out of space. My bars on mars. 
I spit bars, 
That convict convicts into the prisons 
Not. To mention I'm 16 spitting the sickest shit ever written 
Real lyricist are back. 
Real lyricist are back 
Aye Macon. I went Ham 
On you on this track. 
Real lyricist are back, 
Real, lyricist are back 
I stay in chicks head when I murder each and every track 
But fuck it switch the topic 
I'm in the picture when you crop it, 
My flow 
I. Never stop it. 
Tell me who going stop it 
You You or You 
Like, wet grass in the morning dew what you do. 
But y'all niggas bore me: I'm yawning 
Stop, bitching 
When, Caroline google me, like chrome, 
It ain't. My fault, Caroline meet me on Biddle
