Popular Music of Latin America (Final Portfolio Guidelines) Lyrics
by Russell Cobb.

_Students are required to do at least 75 annotations spread over at least 10.
songs. This means you could do one song with 5 annotations, another with 10.
annotations, another with 6, etc. BUT YOU MUST COVER AT LEAST 10 SONGS AND AT.
LEAST 75 ANNOTATIONS by the time you hand in your portfolio_.

You will be annotating at least 10 songs over the next ten weeks. Your.
annotations will be for public view on Rap Genius and/or Rock Genius. In.
addition to this, however, you will be handing in to me a portfolio of all you.
have done. This document explains what the portfolio will look like.

On December 6, you will hand in a portfolio of the work you have done over the.
course of the fall for the course. This will be a hard copy and will consist.
of the following elements:.

1\. A list of the 15 songs you have annotated, with the lyrics and the.
annotations printed out in Word. You will also include the blurb for the.
“About this song “ section on the righthand side of the Rap Genius/Poetry.
Genius website. This should look something like this.
