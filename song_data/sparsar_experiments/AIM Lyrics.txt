AIM Lyrics
by Tyga.

She' don't know my name.
She just know me by my aim.

She' don't know my name.
She just know me by my aim.

Aim tyga man again.
Got a little message for my instant friends.
Be back in a mintue on vacation.
Away from them haters hating on him.

Gotta be more then a 4 to impress him.
Punch in my pin.
And begin the chatting.
Ichat the best mac book I'm a mac yes.
Getting every dollar g.e.d dymes.
Captial charge I did the crime.
Can't take the heat don't feel the fire.
She difficult to reach but I'm harder to find cause.

She don't know me by my name.
She just know me by my aim.
My song on her page on myspace.
Never seen her face.
She send messages.
I sign on it's like aim aim aim.
She don't know me by my name.
She just know me by my aim.
She don't know me by my name.

She don't know my name.
She just know me by my aim.
She don't know my name.

Next chick buddy list gotta sleep.

Magic magician what the games been missing.
Rap is favorite swagg and she diggs.
This is turning into a daily thing.
Comma routine baby how you doing?
Alright hows your music.
Just fine.
I'm getting tired brb I typed her.
Phone on silent no time for drama.
Too busy bottle poppin.
Poparazzi recording.
Recording my oasis only.
Always on point like ginolle.
Come card me.

She don't know me by my name.
She just know me by my aim.
My song on her page on myspace.
