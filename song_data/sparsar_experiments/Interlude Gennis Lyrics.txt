Interlude Gennis Lyrics
by Wonder Broz.

Gennis.
Cut my mic on.
Micro-microphone check.
Keep the lights off, ready, ready, ready set.
Here I go, all in one motion.
Cruise on the beat, call that dead coastin'.
Girls call me lotion, cause when it's dry.
Moist it up Frank Ocean.
Mm, for real though.
I'm kinda quiet to myself, quite the weirdo.
Wonder Broz, your favorite supe-.
Favorite superhero.
Never been a zero, pockets on fat mode.
I ain't gotta spell it out, she know how I'm ?
Row, row, row, your boat.
I live and breathe NCredible, shout out to my C.E.O, he already know.
Nick pulled the ? out so we about to blow.
Patty cake baker man, we gets that dough, oh!
You know who I be, stuntin, murder on that alphabet.
Lucky lucky me, I'm G.
In the hot spot toastin', rotisserie on the beat, watch how I roast it.
You already know this, zoom in closer, adjust your focus.
Call that hocus pocus, abracadabra.
Everything matters and that's straight facts, my pops taught me that.
Go hard or go home, is the motto 'til our fades are black.
?
I never look back, I'm young us.
