Perfectly Placed Paint Lyrics
by Visual.

I'm in Logan just.
strollin, hoping crooked cops ain't even scopin.
I ain't provoking, I just know them dudes are very bogus.
I'm trying to focus, picturing my magnum opus.
Staring at society realizing that its broken.
Smoking, breathe vaporize right in front of my eyes.
&amp; I can't tell if its this weather, my words or my life.
I'm gonna fight, I'm the gritty,witty,windy city type.
Knives stickin out my back but I still feel alright.
Sometimes I'm high,trippin staring at the sky &amp; lake.
Thinking if everything I see is really in front of my face.
Or if everything I see is just perfectly placed paint.
Or if everything I see is just perfectly placed paint.
