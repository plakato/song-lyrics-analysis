Waiting For Acceptance Lyrics
by Unnamed.


I keep on knocking, but there's no one there to answer.
I'd open the door myself, but I'm still hesitant to enter.
Is the money and the fame all a part of the game?
Will my life be the same? No, everything will change.
And I say I'm me, I'm raw but I'd still change.
They say money isn't everything but I still want it.
I'm a hypocrite, probably get gone quick.
My 15 minutes is it, then I'm dead, I don't even get visits.
Then what? Back to where I am now.
Videos getting 20 views and I'm like “Wow!
I can't wait to show my friends, they'll be so proud.
I'm just one more step away from a sell-out crowd!”.
But the reality is, I'm not wanted in this biz.
I don't wear big chains or have diamonds on my wrist.
And I ain't gonna hide it, the shit gets me pissed.
But who cares if it gets me pissed.
Who cares if I exist?
How should I do it? Cordless phone in the bath?
Throw my body into moving traff-.
Icarus better not fly close to me.
Fuck his wings, I'll burn him and his family.
Just to prove how hot Unnamed would be.
I'm above this industry.
Fuck the clown talk, the only time I'd kill myself.
Is if rap went to hell or got put on the shelf.
‘Cause I'll never quit, I will win.
Even if it means I'm always grinding.
I'll rise up, I'm the one.
Like the client of Paul Heyman.
Fuck a winning streak, I'll conquer it.
The game, I'm on top of it.
And don't fight it, there's no stopping it.
You ain't got a spot ‘cause I just parked in it.
All you fucking rappers do is talk about drugs.
How you grew up in a place where people get mugged.
How you have always been a real life thug.
It's a shame that no one gives a fuck.
Yeah I've smoked weed too bro, it's nothing to brag about.
You just smoke it, zone out and laugh throughout.
And people get mugged where I live too.
I know a guy who got stabbed over 10 pounds it's true.
Why the fuck would you want to brag about something like that?
Knowing a Mother might lose her child because of another's act.
Fuck being a thug, being real is what matters.
Being a thug ain't shit, it's as fake as wrestling matches.
I'm putting these phonies to sleep, they're gonna need a mattress.
I'm pulling you down, you better hope someone catches.
I'm not sorry if I offend, I scream fuck you, but that's just me.
Hate me all you want, I'm not everyone's cup of tea.

Remember me, fuck Unnamed. My name is Ste.
I don't know why I say sick things, blame the adolescence.
When I finally break in, you will all feel my presence.
One day I'll be the King and you will all be my peasants.
But until then I'm sitting here, waiting for acceptance.
