New Jack City Lyrics
by Wreckx-N-Effect.

Yo Damien yo hit the sticks.
Slim you hit the base.
Yo, are you ready to kick it.
Here we go.
Check 1-2, Check 1-2.
Turn it up just a little bit, well all right.
Let's get a little base.

This is the sound grab your partner and get down.
Everyone must know.
We've been here before and we're gonna give you more.
Its time to let it show.
Music is funky, girls are so fine.
So sweet and vidal.
Gotta get the booty.
Oohh it's to late.
Can't belive a thing about the new jack swing.

New Jack City! New Jack City!
New Jack City! New Jack City!

When the party's over and it's time to make that move.
Somebody gotta win, somebody got to lose.
Stop across the lady, hands on her man.
In a new jack city their's no hesitating!

New Jack City! New Jack City!
New Jack City! New Jack City!

Swing it, swing it.
Swing it, swing it.
Swing it, swing it.
Swing it, swing it.
New Jack City, oohh yyeeaahh.
The new jack swing, the new jack swing.
The new jack swing, the new jack swing.
New jack city! New jack city! New jack city!

New Jack City! New Jack City!
New Jack City! New Jack City!

New new new new, jack, city!
