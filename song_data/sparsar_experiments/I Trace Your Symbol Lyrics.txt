I Trace Your Symbol Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.


I, keep it soft and bright
I keep it tight up, tight
Its magic when its right
Its magic
I chace, the sound down there
Can't, find it any where
I trace you on my ride
I trace your symbol

Under, the other

And hidden person
I traces, your sound down, there
Can't find it any where
I trace you on. My ride
I trace your symbol
We meet in the middle
To solve a riddle

When. Nights, are oisterss to the moon
She lights, a candle in every room
When winter wispers
Wispers. Your name
You find a window
You, find your flame
So. I keep it tight up tight
So, I keep it soft and bright

I trace you on my right
It's, a mater of heart
Not, a matter of
Not a matter of mind
Tonight
So. I keep it soft and bright

So. I keep it tight up. Tight
I trace you on my right
It's, a mater of heart
Not, a matter of
Not a matter of love
