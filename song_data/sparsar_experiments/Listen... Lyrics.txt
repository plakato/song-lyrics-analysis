Listen... Lyrics
by Sydney.

We take care of what is real.
And we inject ourselves with fear.
If I was a ship then you'd be the clouds that constantly tried to drag me down.
Cause we're all forces and we're constantly slipping away.
So I'll sleep well knowing tonight.

That I burn, burn so bright.
That you'll take back the rest of your life.
Leave you grasping at something thats distant.
But you'll know that it's me when you listen.

So this is where both of us end.
You've got your friends I've got my band.
Sorry that I'm just as I seem.
I'll never take hold of the scene.
Feels like so much is slipping away.
But I finally know the real me.

And I'll burn, burn so bright.
That you'll take back the rest of your life.
Leave you grasping at something thats distant.
But you'll know that it's me when it hurts.

Oh, oh I'm just dying to see you.
But the truth is that I'll never leave you.
I'll let it burn the rest of tonight.
As you take back the rest of your life.

Burn, burn so bright.
That you'll take the rest of your life.
Leave you grasping at something that's distant.
But you'll know that it's me when it hurts.

Oh, oh I'm just dying to see you.
But the truth is that I'll never leave you.
I'll let it burn the rest of tonight.
As you take back the rest of your life.
