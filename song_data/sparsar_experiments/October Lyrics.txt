October Lyrics
by A-ha.

Dawn awaits a sleepless English town.
Of coloured grey.
Here I roam the streets without you.
As summer fades away.

Down in the city at nights.
Oh, the cold wind blows.

Wherever you may be right now.
It must be getting late.
You're probably asleep already.
I am wide awake.

Down in the city at nights.

Don't be lonely, so you've told me.
But don't you worry now.
Loneliness can be ignored.
And time has shown me how.

Down in the city at nights.
I'm missing you so much.

Down in the city.
Down in the city.
