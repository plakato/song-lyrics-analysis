Just a Nobody Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


G'yeah, we gon slow things down a lil' bit.
So I can take time out, address some issues.
Give you the real me, walk with me.
I ain't write this one to lose you, you feel me.
Walk with me.

Yung Ro.
Nobody understands, so I wrote God a letter.
All I wanted was peace, and for my family to do better.
It's like they drained the love out me, but I couldn't hate you.
And I had hunger pains, only a bum could relate to.
On my own, but I'm still smiling still standing.
Use to pray for the pain to stop, now I only pray for understanding.
I'm a changed man, me eyesight's so filthy.
My heart bleeds for the world, and I don't need a critic.
Or applause, see homie I'm just doing my job.
I grew out of that gift and curse, I use to think it was hard.
I often talk to God, and I remember the first time.
On my knees holding my head, telling James and crying.
Couldn't move something pulling me, don't feel like a force.
See something talking, but it don't sound like a voice.
Curious, and when I find out the source.
See what would you do man, I had to make a choice.
Listen to these words, come from a young man.
So far but so close, everyone could understand.
I'm not rap or hip hop, and I say it so proudly.
Call me what you want, just no that I'm nobody.

I'm just a nobody, trying to tell everybody.
About somebody, who can save anybody.

How could you look someone straight in the face, and look down on em.
When God's the only one above me, he don't look down on him.
Was it the drugs or my heart, that made me feel so worthless.
I got a gift, and at times I don't think I deserve it.
Some people think I'm perfect, I can't describe my fears.
And if I cried, you wouldn't even understand my tears.
Lord forgive me for my thoughts, my conscience is killing me.
Cause most times when evil comes, I just go so willingly.
My mind sometimes clicks, and everything sit still's.
And at that moment it's so real, yet it's so unreal.
Got me feeling dead already, Lord my life's so hard.
Now I know, why the only thing to fear is God.
A lot of things are odd, am I wrong or right.
And I got them same thoughts, that made Mase turn to Christ.
And I've been searching for the truth, in tears willing and hoping.
Went to church still not moved, wasn't feeling the modif.
Late night jamming Sam Cooke, realizing that change coming.
Just can't depend on partnas, family or my woman.
Find myself singing humming, to myself so proudly.
See I got peace with God, even when I got nobody.

Yung Ro.
For 20 years I grew up, without no home.
So I came up with nobody, cause I feel so alone.
Many thoughts in my dome, times getting too hard.
I'm starving and sinning, trying to stay close to God.
Still praying to the Lord, but feeling like I'm gon crumble.
Receiving test after test, and still remaining so humble.
The mo' humble I stay, the mo' knowledge I gain.
And the mo' knowledge I gain, the mo' I understood pain.
And the mo' I understood pain, the bigger my heart grew.
But hear my pain grew mo', cause now I hurt for me and you.
And when you stressed and depressed, remember nobody cares.
And my nigga when you feel alone, nobody's there.
And my team nobody, we ain't never alone.
Cause we live in nobody land, and our heart is our home.
You could ask any of my niggas, they'll tell you what's up.
It's nobody to the end, because nobody gave a fuck.
And nobody would bust, you think I'm playing do you.
When you got nobody to worry about, cause nobody will shoot you.
It's crucial my nigga, I got too much love.
Remember nights on my knees, sending my praises above.
Saying nobody hears me, and nobody listens.
I found out nobody cares, and receive the mission.
And what I thought I'd been missing, had been there the whole time.
Love, support, foundation and grind.
And now I'm a nobody, on a mission from heaven.
To make the world feel nobody, and when I die I'll be a legend.

G'yeah, to make the world feel nobody.
And when I die I'll be a legend.

La-la-la-la-la, nobo-ody nobody.
