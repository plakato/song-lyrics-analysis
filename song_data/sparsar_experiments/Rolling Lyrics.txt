Rolling Lyrics
by Two-9.


Ad libs 
Jace talking 
 
I'm, just ridin' round rollin' 
Ridin' round rollin 
Two cups, what I'm holdin' 
Said, I'm ridin' round: rollin' 
Ridin' round rollin' 
I'm, just ridin' round rollin' 
 
Ridin' round rollin' 
Ridin' round rollin' 
Round, just rollin' 
Said, I'm ridin' round rolling 
Riding round rolling 
I'M just riding round rolling 
 
I been ridin' round and rollin' 
Wit', two cups that I been holdin' 
For the past like twenty-four and 
Ain't no plans, an' letting go and 
Only love her when she's rollin' 
Know to pour a four in 
My, snow, white, Styrofoam and 
I get caught up in the moments: 
In a jeep, no bucks 
All, that's missin' is Aaliyah 
Crawlin on all fours Paul Wall at the coliseum, 
Kill ‘em off mausoleum, 
Like, a boss, Rick Ross, Slim Thugger, 
Carpe Diem hoes be screamin' when they see him 
And. I'M feeling like a genius 
Neutron Jimmy on the road South Park, 
Got me feeling, like “Timmy, ” 
All these haters steady, hatin', 
Only givin', like Timmy 
I'm geeked up just cruisin' through my city, 
 
Chrous, 
, 
Ay, ay, ay, ay 
I been out here and I'm rollin' 
All this Oxycontin stolen 
Put, my pitbulls in the back 
I'm, the leader of the pack 
I, had to slow down with the potion 
Everybody gettin' worried 
Cause. They see I'm in a hurry. 
Till they go without a story. 
It'S some niggas, that's gon' hate 
Cause. They, ladies seen my purpose: 
See the pain inside my eyes, 
She gon', open up her thighs 
I, regret my sin. Then repent 
Conversation with my kins 
Pour, some liquor out cause 
They ain't here. I hope 
They. Let us in 
 
All. This pain is bottled up. 
Pocket fulla medicine 
Cup is fulla memories, 
Pocket fulla Benjamins 
I got a heart: a gold 
To mine'embellem' 
Two-9 to the death of me; 
I hope they. Let us in 
 
Ridin' round rollin' 
So, I'm ridin round rollin… 
Said, I'm ridin' round rollin… 
Said, I'm ridin' round rolling. 
Said, I'm ridin' round rolling 
Said, I'm ridin' round rolling 
Harmonizing
