Feel Appeal Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

There's a girl I know who's got the goods, she'll make you feel alright.
If you're feelin' poor she's got the cure, she's steady.
So take her hands and make 'em dance all up and down your spine.
If you top up things, she'll let you in, she's ready.

RELEASE:.

She got your number, she got the time all the time.
She got yours, she got mine, gonna make what's right.
She got your number, she got the time all the time.
She got yours, she got mine, gonna do what's right.

She got feel appeal, she dig you out from under.
Feel appeal, she'll make you feel alright.
Feel appeal, she shake you down like thunder.
Feel appeal, she'll dig you through the night.

She'll close your eyes, she'll make you wise, be careful or you bow.
Quiet in betweens, she'll rip you clean, she's deadly.
She's lightning fast, wants first and last to feel good like a king.
Then she'll leave you overloaded roll, she's deadly.

She got feel appeal, she dig you out from under.
Feel appeal, she'll make you feel alright, right, right, right.
Feel appeal, she shake you up and down like thunder.
Feel appeal, she'll get you through the, take you through the, bring you.
through the, shake you through the night.

She, she got the feel appeal.
