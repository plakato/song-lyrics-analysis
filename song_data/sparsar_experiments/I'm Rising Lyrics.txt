I'm Rising Lyrics
by Uniq Mic.


I'm not a rapper I'm a rapist, I rape bits.
Don't wait for nine months, give birth to masterpiece.
Been pushing ever since I was I young, but not babies.
I should be common coz I'm bringing sense.
Ever since I stepped to the Mic, you can ask Rhyme Essence.
And men I'm the beast, call me Alleister Crowley.
And I ain't stopping until I'm holy.
Shit, I'll be going so hard, never stopping until am at holy.
Wood, I've been making bits, now bits are making me.
20 and 30 years to come gave birth to me so I'm the future.
You say you got shows? I was booked before I was born.
The sun is rising, I'm the sun coz I make you scorn.
I sing chords you say only Satan can sing.
Music got my heart locked in – Dead Man's Chest.
I'm the W double R; Whack Rap Resistant.
I wonder why I'm getting Bills, Can't you see I'm not Gates?
I was born in Malawi but I can see one thing is true, I'm destined for united.
states.
So when I'm clicking don't stop me, BUST IT.

I love it when they say they hate me now.

I hate it when they say they love me now.

I heard my face was on the sun today, get it? I'm rising.
These people say they feel me but their bodies I ain't touching.
What my mind conceived is what my mind is bearing.
Other MCs wondering how I did it coz men their minds are barren.

I'm adding credit to the game as if I'm playing poker.
I got elements of rap figured out – Avatar.
And if you don't use your style well, I will still it – Burglar.
I'm like Jesus in this game, Arthur and Omega.
I will beat you badly and take your chick – Omega.
I'm playing God forgive me for my sins, for I've done a lot of blasphemy.
And I guess I should have played for the chick that be blowing me.
I've given birth to a lot of bits, I'm making a colony.
I ain't singing so that I should be signed by you or Sony.
Matter of fact, neither I'm I rapping to drive girls horny.
I'm just rapping coz I rap but these girls just love me Sonnie.
