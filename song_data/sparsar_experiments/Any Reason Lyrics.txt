Any Reason Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.

Is everybody on the same page?
Is it safe to say we're all sick and tired of living this way?
Sick of swallowin' lies, sick of followin' trends.
Sick of swallowin' pride, sick of followin' them.
Tired of falling in line, not speaking your minds.
Tired of askin why, and gettin no reply.
Try to keep the drive.
Seems so hopeless right?
Anything is possible if you and I ?corrage?

There's a life they seek in you.
Despite you when I'm ?Loo?
Lifes the inner few, gotta fight for me and you.
It's like the western view, we rest and never move.
Sip the nectars brew, and enjoy the better view.
Cause who's gonna say it?
Come on, who's gonna be the one?
Who's gonna make it happen?
Who's gonna save us from...us?
When the time comes, when the time runs out.
Let the crowd die down, everyone gather round.

Are we gonna take it? No.
Not for a damn thing.
Not for anybody.
And not for any reason.
Then how we gonna make it?
When no one even cares?
Aren't you tired of being patient?
Stand strong and be prepared.

Stop, take a minute off and I can just.
Drop everything thats got you trippin its not.
A great commitment of times and we've got.
To get ourselves realigned.
Each day we wake, same old mistakes.
Keep on this pace, or lose this place.
We choose to make, this life this way.
And despite the stakes, still live as slaves.
Behave as though outside a window.
Not in this rows of roads, littered with condo's.
City lights that glow, a bitter light composed.
Of lost souls, dyin souls who profit off our woes.

Oh hey now, I kinda like the way your faith sounds.
Play aloud and give me time to wind the day down.
Stay around awhile and we can sit about.
And talk speak your mind let it out and we can set it off.
Just get it off your chest, fuck stayin' depressed.
Put it all to rest, and rise about your nest.
Don't settle for less, come on make some noise.
Renovate the mess, and let me hear your voice.
