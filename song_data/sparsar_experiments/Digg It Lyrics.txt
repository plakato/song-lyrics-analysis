Digg It Lyrics
by Que.


Diamonds shinin' like a christmas tree.
All my bitches say they sick of me.
Fuck these niggas, ain't no sympathy.
Bunch of chains on like Mr. T.
Me and your bitch got good chemistry.
You lil' niggas is some Mini-Mes.
Pull up with heavy artillery.
Everybody leavin' with injuries.

Can you digg it, digg it, digg it, digg it?

Bitches kissing, that's my cup of tea.
Two is cool, but three's a company.
Diamonds yellow like a bumblebee.
Ashton Kutcher, ain't no punking me.
Presidential Rollie, gold oyster.
Got your bitch fucking in the foyer.
Cause I'm on the radio like Tom Joyner.
Plus I'm legendary like I'm Tom Sawyer.
Fresh black pair of Cortez.
Pockets looking like they corn fed.
VVs shinin', playin' peekaboo.
Fuck your bitch and pull a switcharoo.
Had to kick the bird out the chicken coupe.
All my bitches come with warranties.
Swiping lean at the pharmacy.
Jugging drinks, grand larceny.
Ball like Marcus Camby, word to my granny.
Gold chain o' Xannies, running with the jammy.
Selling niggas whammies, turn up for my family.
Lean taste like candy, swear it comes in handy.
Can you digg it nigga? Is you with it nigga?
If he start tripping, fuck it, lynch the nigga.
Pull up in a Bentley in some slippers nigga.
On you old pussy, sweet McGriddle niggas.
