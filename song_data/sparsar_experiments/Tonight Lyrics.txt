Tonight Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.

Lil'Man.
Listen baby, girl I can't help myself.
I don't want nobody else.
Girl can't you see I were meant for you.
You were meant for me, listen baby.
And it's clear as a bell.
You love me I can tell.
So girl what's up.
You can not deny we're falling.
Falling in love ooh girl.

3rd Storee.
Girl tonight, tonight.
I got a feeling tonight, tonight.
Tonight I'm gon' be yours and yours alone.
You know yours alone.

Lil'Man.
Listen baby, please girl don't keep me waiting.
Keep me anticipating, I'm so in love.
There ain't no doubt about it.
You're the one that I love.

3rd Storee.
Girl tonight, tonight.
I got a feeling tonight, tonight.
Tonight I'm gon' be yours and yours alone.
You know yours alone.

Lil'Man.
I, I'm so infatuated.
Feels like I'm not your baby.
The way I'm feeling inside.
Oh I, I won't deny it baby.
You're the only thing I want.
And I want it tonight and I....

3rd Storee.
Girl tonight, tonight.
I got a feeling tonight, tonight.
Tonight I'm gon' be yours and yours alone.
You know yours alone.
