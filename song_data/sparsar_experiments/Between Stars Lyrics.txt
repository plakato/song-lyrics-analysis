Between Stars Lyrics
by Underworld.

I drive too fast.
Under a full moon.
Save the best to last.
Under a full moon.
And pray you don't crash.
Under a full moon.
When the head's too far out of whack.
Step back, step back.
Step back, step back.
Step back, step back.
Step back, step back.
Step back, step back.
And the hope of the world.
Rides with one man.
Everybody crying.
On the telephone ringing.
We hold our breath.
We spin around the world.
You and me cling.
To the outside of the earth.
Under a full moon.
Under a full moon.
I got you on my brain again, again.
And I hear your voice.
On a northbound bus.
Chinatown to Chinatown.
And the hope of the world.
Rides with one man.
Everybody crying.
On the telephone ringing.
We hold our breath.
We spin around the world.
You and me cling.
To the outside of the earth.
Under a full moon.
Will you hold my camera?
Will you press release?
Will you capture me?
As the lights go down.
And the hope of the world.
Rides with one man.
Everybody crying.
On the telephone ringing.
We hold our breath.
We spin around the world.
You and me cling.
To the outside of the earth.
Under a full moon.
Step back, step back.
Step back, step back.
Step back, step back.
Step back, step back.
Don't wait for me, I'm always late.
It's in my blood, in the stone.
I feel the world go round.
I feel the world go round.
