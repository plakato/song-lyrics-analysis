Meh Sharabi Lyrics
by Swetshop Boys.

Riz MC.
I'm the moon on the Pak flag.
Roll with stars but don't sleep at night.
I rise and I fall like a Pak flag.
Lean on the green and the white.
? line, teeth I'ma grind.
Seeking a sign.
But lean off the wine for time.
The Quran just said no more drink.
I'm gonna be in heaven with the god of small print.
Twist up in the damage.
Kissing all the girls.
Listening to garbage.
Because he misses how it feels.
Pistol at his health.
Pissed off at himself.
Like he's hotting up in house.
Pissing on himself.
South Hall sheds to designer suites.
Is he out of his head ?
No right to sleep, no crime, just right to pee.
Hides from the silence he should try to seek.

Heems.
From the south ? to the south side queens.
Getting southpaw head from a south side queen.
I'm a Rancho Cucamonga with my cousin named Day-Day.
Cut real yayay with that big book from AA.
I'm like Sunny Deol, so Punjabi.
On that Johnnie Walker, so sherabi.
I'm so Shiv Kumar Batalvi.
I'm a friend of Guru Dutt.
So I'm Abrar Alvi.
I've been drinking, I be thinking.
I be sinking like Titanic.
I be smiling, I get riled and.
I be wylin like a manic.
He a attic and his ? so tragic.
He make a trick disappear like it's magic.
Hima so rude he would spit in your food.
He a drunk, he a punk, he spit at them dude.
He wanna hit a lewd in the nude.
He drink Blue Label because.
it match his mood.

Riz MC.
I wallow in the hollow and I follow my dealer.
When I'm back from Berlin, man I'm off to Ibiza.
Out of the frying pan into the pita.
Never land life never wanna land neither.
My poor shrink wrapped it up nice.
Thinks I shrink-wrap my life in pics, raps, and likes.
Confused quick fix a plan.
8 comments and 8-balls, Instagram.
New chick new into Jai Paul.
in Munich.
I root ?
Assume visions of a Paki in a Man U shirt.
Feel a flute coming as I flew to Lutin.
Reach for that aspirin.
Reach for the stars.
Reach for a MacBook.
It's hidden in her bra.
Reach for a napkin the black ?
Back in hospital again with my platinum scars.
