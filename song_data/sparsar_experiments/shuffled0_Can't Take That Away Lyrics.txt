Can't Take That Away Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

How were all gonna see him on the judgement day.
One more time.

They held on with pride to everything they believed.
Cause it ain't too late.
When you got the truth inside, now they can't take that away.

They can take God off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it funny.
Put away the pledge of allegience.
Wanna' take the cross off of the hill.
Hold on to what you believe because they can't take that.
Just like my father's father before him.
One more time.
How were all gonna see him on the judgement day.
Right now a change ain't what we need.
What can they all be thinking.
So sing it loud.
Hear what you say.
There's a fire that burns forever.

They can take God off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it funny.
Lord,just the thought gives me a chill.
Come a day we ain't gonna take no more.

They can't take that away.

They want to change something somewhere for everybody.
