Gotta Leave (Remix) Lyrics
by 702.

Meelah.
You've got me pullin' out my weave.
You got me cutting off my hair.
You've got me so stressed out.
I can't think straight like you don't even.
Care how you do me like you do.
Got the nerve to try and rule.
Me like I'm your child.
I hate your style, you too buck wild.

1 - Why you do, what you do.
Keep on actin' like a fool.
Treat me bad, treat me cruel.
So I've gotta go.

Why you do, what you do.
Keep on actin' like a fool.
Treat me bad, treat me cruel.
So I've gotta go.

Meelah.
Boy, I done had it up to here.
So let's get one thing clear.
Won't you check this out.
I'm not your girl, you're not my man.
If this you don't know.
Then I will tell you so.
Get your hands off me.
Just let me go and let me be.

Missy.
Izzy izzy izzy.
Party people move side-to-side.
Let this joint go on bumpin' ya ride.
Let the whole world feel it.
Kick the bass, the low's and high's.
Tell 'em crank that joint one time, ooh.

Party people move side-to-side.
Let this joint go on bumpin' ya ride.
Let the whole world feel it.
Kick the bass, the low's and high's.
Tell 'em crank that joint one time, ooh.

Meelah.
Why you do the things you do?
Keep on actin' like a fool.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

Why you do the things you do?
Keep on actin' like a fool.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ooh, ooh.

702.
Why you do, what you do.

Keep on actin', like a fool.

Treat me bad, treat me cruel.

So I've gotta go....

Why you do, what you do.

Keep on actin', like a fool.

Treat me bad, treat me cruel.

So I've gotta go....
