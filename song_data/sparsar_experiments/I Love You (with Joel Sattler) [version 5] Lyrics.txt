I Love You (with Joel Sattler) [version 5] Lyrics
by Zippy Kid.

I love you.
I love you.
Is that so.
Hard to understand.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
As much as I can.

See me.
See me.
See me.
For what I am.

Tomorrow.
We will be strong.
Tomorrow.
That's not so long.
Tomorrow.
And then until.
Tomorrow.
Just say you will.

Need me.
Need me.
Need me.
The way that I need you.

No crying.
No tears to shed.
No crying.
Get over it.
No sorrow.
Sit for a while.
No sorrow.
Just try to smile.

Be free.
Be free.
Be free.
Just try to say you'll.
Be free.
Be free.
Be free.
Of yesterday.

I love you.
I love you.
Is that so.
Hard to understand.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
As much as I can.
