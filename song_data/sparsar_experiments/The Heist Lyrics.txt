We could do this.
We could get paid.
Whats up?

The caper, its all on paper.
I got the blueprint, bout to put a dent in the industry.
Assembly, rob and finagles.
Which way you wanna be strangled.
Collectin cash get yo ass tangled, up.
In full fledge fatigues.
Military speed,.
I'm at the old hotel.
Where we used to inhale.
My dreams, fly things, this is how we got things.

I'm twisted like licorice.
I fiend for the cris.
Between my fingers, I wish.
Like Skee Lo ridin shot gun.
I'm on 1,  jump out the car.
Just hit the door 3, 4 everybody on the floor.
Talkin to my drivers K-Bar.
Her car getaway say Alex Baldwin.
We rap stars we are.
The one who starts to show before it begins.
the car's in front of the bank I'm goin in.

This is a raid everybody lay down but hey.
Now give up the cash dont make us have to blast.
This is a raid everybody lay down but hey.
This is a hold up, ya hands should go up.
This is a raid.

Time for the heist, jump out the plane.
Skydivin on the block, ready or not, strap on my Glock.
Synchronized watch, here comes me high parachuting down.
Through the rooftop like drop zone, I'm stoned.
Next snap elbows like legos.
Blood clot stops circulation, drown security to the floor.
Ya know, dumpin em in a row like dominos, fo sho, fo sho.

Takin everything, first parachuting right door I'm lootin.
Dont make a move, cuz ya know I'm shootin.
Grabbin on stacks, loadin up backpacks.
Crackin open the safe, I'm hittin boughts from the back.
Hella hella, I'm ya new ready teller.
Are you in a job, there ain't no goodfella.
In this mob, makin whats throb, while heads spin.
But in about five seconds the mission will end.

This is a raid everybody lay down but hey.
Now give up the cash dont make us have to blast.
This is a raid everybody lay down but hey.
This is a hold up, ya hands should go up.
This is a raid.

We lost the way to getaway.
In the getaway car.
So get back capture rapture before I splat ya.
Up against the wall, ah nah.
We see a road block, flock.
Cuz I'm a ridah like 2Pac.
I got the steerin wheel.
And Jah Skill peel caps.
Out the window of the coupe Deville uphill.
But still the case ups dust and dirt flies.
Its sick of do or die got a shooter on my thigh.

We high, gotta evade the escapade.
Option 1 was deleted, option 2 I must complete it.
Out to raid, your whole sector.
Squeeze ya for ya nector.
Won't let ya catch me.
Westside dippin we unified.
Westside dippin we unified.
Westside dippin we unified.
Westside dippin we unified.

This is a raid everybody lay down but hey.
Now give up the cash dont make us have to blast.
This is a raid everybody lay down but hey.
This is a hold up, ya hands should go up.
This is a raid.

We missed the robbing like empty lobbies.
The security start attacking.
Know what happened.

Neb-Luv, she caught a slug.
Couple red, dead.
Teaching the spread.
Cuz he shot Knee-Hi in the head.

In my backpack, in my bra, my drawls.
I'm stuffed like Santa Claus and Biggie Smalls.
Come blind.
Lets enter the airline.
With swiftness, quickness we runnin out of time.

x2.
This is a raid everybody lay down but hey.
Now give up the cash dont make us have to blast.
This is a raid everybody lay down but hey.
This is a hold up, ya hands should go up.
This is a raid.
