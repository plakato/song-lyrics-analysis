IAmInHuman Lyrics
by VON.

Bone fragments.
Skin tentacles.
Stretch the vein.
Senses fear.
Darkness within.
Uncontrollable.
The coming is near.
As the light turns to black.
Forces me.
Feeds me.
Unstoppable possession.
Invasion soul is sold.
Subdues me.
Controls me.
Kills me.
IAmInHuMan.
IAmInHuMan.
Unhinge science intersect collect.
Uncover the hidden bestial birth deaths.
Manifestations the coming tribal war.
Evil psychosis manifests the one.
Cold &amp; bloody bury me alive.
Lost my way back dripping deaths design.
Hypnotic voices listen to them cry.
My mind is shattered save me before I die.
IAmInHuMan.
IAmInHuMan.
