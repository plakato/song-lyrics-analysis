by XP.


Yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah 
Yo turn my- turn my mic up. Turn my- 
Turn my shit up: real quick 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah yeah

1-v-1 Status, 
Yeah yeah, yeah, 1-3-1-7 
Yeah yeah, yeah, 
 
Half, a zombie. I got white bitches like Abercrombie 
Popped, the vyvanse and it hit me like a titan yeah 
I flew Delta and I flexed it like it's private, yeah 
How much you spent to take her out. I spend a grip on my bitch 
Cause. I got it, I got it: 
Yeah yeah, yeah 
I got it yeah, yeah yeah. I got it 
Don't trip. I got it: yeah yeah, yeah, 
, 
Riding round the city. It'S just me and my niggas 
If you ain't a hoe or thot. Then you ain't coming with us 
No I ain't Michael Phelps and I ain't going swimming 
But. The game been feeling real shallow, since I stepped in this bitch and 
Uh word to my mother. Ain'T never been a fronter 
Nigga, keep it one hundred we sending shots at each other 
You making moves. You still ain't paid. Your dues 
She told you. She ain't, send me nudes 
But, I'm getting boobies in bunches, 
That, Fetty Louie and hundreds 
Eat. These niggas, like lunch-ins, 
Ain't a Jumpman remix, but them boys is up to something 
Yeah. I'M tired of your lies, 
Brought more sparks in the game. Then the fucking 4th of July 
 
Half, a zombie. I got white bitches like Abercrombie 
Popped, the vyvanse and it hit me like a titan yeah 
I flew Delta and I flexed it like it's private, yeah 
How much you spent to take her out. I spend a grip on my bitch 
Cause. I got it, I got it. 
Yeah yeah, yeah 
I got it yeah, yeah yeah. I got it 
Don't trip. I got it. Yeah yeah yeah
