Half (Remix) Lyrics
by XP.


Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yo turn my- turn my mic up, turn my-.
Turn my shit up real quick.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
1-v-1 Status.
Yeah yeah yeah 1-3-1-7.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Half a zombie, I got white bitches like Abercrombie.
Popped the vyvanse and it hit me like a titan, yeah.
I flew Delta and I flexed it like it's private, yeah.
How much you spent to take her out? I spend a grip on my bitch.
Cause I got it, I got it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.
Don't trip, I got it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Riding round the city it's just me and my niggas.
If you ain't a hoe or thot then you ain't coming with us.
No I ain't Michael Phelps and I ain't going swimming.
But the game been feeling real shallow since I stepped in this bitch and.
Uh word to my mother ain't never been a fronter.
Nigga keep it one hundred we sending shots at each other.
You making moves? You still ain't paid your dues.
She told you she ain't send me nudes.
But I'm getting boobies in bunches.
That Fetty, Louie and hundreds.
Eat these niggas like lunch-ins.
Ain't a Jumpman remix but them boys is up to something.
Yeah I'm tired of your lies.
Brought more sparks in the game then the fucking 4th of July.

Half a zombie, I got white bitches like Abercrombie.
Popped the vyvanse and it hit me like a titan, yeah.
I flew Delta and I flexed it like it's private, yeah.
How much you spent to take her out? I spend a grip on my bitch.
Cause I got it, I got it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.
Don't trip, I got it, yeah, yeah, yeah.
