Bomb Threat Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


Bitch I'm Mayweather, flow hot as May, whether-.
Or not you rappers like it, bitch I am way better.
I'm about to start the show, pull a seat up.
Kardashian flow, please try and keep up.

All my niggas in the street selling dope nigga.
Weed and coke nigga, get it by the boat nigga.
Fucking go getta, you already know nigga.
Left the garden, I ain't fucking with you ho niggas.
Looking for the bud, this the Cosby Show nigga.
Wheel of Fortune if you trying to buy an O nigga.
Big doe nigga, sick flow nigga.
This a bomb threat, I'm about to blow nigga.

Knocking this ciroc off, smoking on the best of weed.
Riding with my top off, where the fuck my Jerry beads?
Shawty keep calling, keep texting, emailing me.
She in love with the ding dong like Melanie.
Niggas know my pedigree, Triple H status.
Heartless, headbussa, and I raise Havoc.
Pockets straight, no lie, fuck up out my face faggot.
Full grown fly, fuck up out my face maggot.
Bad bitch magnet, I let the squad in her.
She turn to Mary Mary, she want the god in her.
I put the rod in her, go fishing.
That pussy start biting soon as I put the dick in.
Got Octomom's stomach in the trunk, that bitch kicking.
And I hop up in that bitch and tell the roof good riddance.
Grown ass man, who the fuck are you kidding?
Know I got you pissed, who the fuck are you shitting?
Fuck what you heard, Shawn's bathroom visit.
Put clips in your head, I'm a fucking beautician.
Cooking up my new vision, looking back at Wadley waving.
I'm the future, ain't nobody seeing me but Raven.
Got married to my carpet ‘cause my flow is so engaging.
And they just mini mes, small Is, fucking Asians.
Man I'm ‘bout to run the nation, I can't wait until the poll over.
Bitch I am a problem and this shit will never blow over.
Wake up and I roll over, new day, new face.
Early in the morning, in her mouth like toothpaste.
And I drink goose straight, paper's all I do chase.
Eyes low, you can blindfold me with a shoelace.
Boppers get the suitcase, only fuck with models.
And we waking up to blunt roaches and Ciroc bottles.
Even when I was a toddler, always stayed away from suckers.
I ain't like to watch Arthur, he was hanging with a buster.
Square motherfuckers, yeah motherfucker.
I'll be waiting at your house, meet me there motherfucker.
I'm a rare motherfucker, flawless diamond, y'all are cubics.
You squares acting hard, I know how to solve the Rubik's.
Got big racks, I ain't talking fake boobies.
And I'm balling everywhere, man I even lost my pubics.
Wanna shoot it, we can shoot it, Kleenex bullets, I'll let it out.
Cocky when I got that heat, I'll run up in Eddie house-.
Like Steve Urkel, smoke nothing but purple.
Y'all niggas talk the talk, I'm a walker like Herschel.
Better cuff your old lady ‘cause I'm feeling like Usher.
I don't charge for my attention, I'ma have to reimburse her.

And ball all day, no sub, keep the hoagie.
Got sour in the bogey, motherfucker I'm loaded.
I'll buy some new boxers, fuck this I can't hold it.
Yeah I know I'm killing this, nigga I wrote it.
Keep steel like I'm getting tattooed, I tote it.
Make your bitch do aerobics, young Dolemite Jr.
Walk into the room and legs spread like rumors.
Shawty say that she ain't even swallow ‘fore I knew her.
Now I'm Oklahoma dreaming, wish I started rapping sooner.
We battle, they gon' boo ya, man my flow is just the roughest.
Make a buster drop the mic, Tyson vs. Douglas.
Ya like it or ya love it, either way that's a check pops.
Riding with the mac in my lap, fuck a desktop.
Told my ol' lady baby all the games best stop.
If we ain't working, I can still hit my ex box.
Looking for some trouble then this where the GPS stops.
Diamonds get ya hoes in the sheets, call ‘em bed rocks.
Boy I stay shitting, treat the booth like a rest stop.
And I'ma keep saying I'm the best ‘til the rest stop.
