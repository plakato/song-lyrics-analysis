Black Soul Lyrics
by Running Wild.

Blackness is calling, you're enslaved by its rule.
Obeying your madness, the weak-hearted fool.
Possessed by evil, you're on their game.
Hate is your motive to rule in their name.

Biolytic evil, you kill and devour.
You fight alterations to save all your power.
You're betraying the youth you're blinding their eyes.
You're selling them drugs, you're feeding them lies.

Madness reigns, evil affection.
Blood and death, the endless pain.
Madman's game, self-deception.
Deceit and lies gonna rule the game.

Black soul you're breathing the poison of evil.
Delusions of grandeur, the soul-eating plaque.
Black soul your doomed to eternal damnation.
You're melting in fire, the justice of fate.

The contract is made and it's written in blood.
Betraying the world to save what you've got.
Distortion of truth keeps the evil alive.
And you cut your own throat with a rust-poisoned knife.

Madness reigns, evil affection.
Blood and death, the endless pain.
Madman's game, self-deception.
Deceit and lies gonna rule the game.

Black soul you're breathing the poison of evil.
Delusions of grandeur, the soul-eating plaque.
Black soul your doomed to eternal damnation.
You're melting in fire, the justice of fate.

Weakness is evil and evil is weak.
They never will share the power they seek.
You're a wealthless merepawn under their spell.
They've promised you heaven but they've sold you to hell.

Madness reigns, evil affection.
Blood and death, the endless pain.
Madman's game, self-deception.
Deceit and lies gonna rule the game.

Black soul you're breathing the poison of evil.
Delusions of grandeur, the soul-eating plaque.
Black soul your doomed to eternal damnation.
You're melting in fire, the justice of fate.
Black soul you're breathing the poison of evil.
Delusions of grandeur, the soul-eating plaque.
Black soul your doomed to eternal damnation.
You're melting in fire, the justice of fate.
