Picture Frames Lyrics
by Xazz.


Years gone by and I still don't know.
Where and when, why I, had to go.
Close the door as I walk away.
Excuse my tears if you can see my face.

Our tongues were tied, but that's okay.
You never loved me anyway.
Shattered mirrors and picture frames.
Maybe we'll try again some other day.

When you feel like it's all okay.
That love was lost just the other day.
Shattered mirrors and picture frames.
Think back on all the things you used to know.

For years been fighting, made it now.
But that all ended, months ago.
Our time is over, no more time for closure.
Why the moments never feel so slow?

I'm praying for another go.
Even though, the answer's no.
Shattered mirrors and picture frames.
My time has come to a close.

When you feel like it's all okay.
That love was lost just the other day.
Shattered mirrors and picture frames.
Think back on all the things you used to know.
When you feel like it's all okay.
That love was lost just the other day.
Shattered mirrors and picture frames.
Think back on all the things you used to know.

Instrumental.

When you feel like it's all okay.
That love was lost just the other day.
Shattered mirrors and picture frames.
Think back on all the things you used to know.
When you feel like it's all okay.
That love was lost just the other day.
Shattered mirrors and picture frames.
Think back on all the things you used to know.
