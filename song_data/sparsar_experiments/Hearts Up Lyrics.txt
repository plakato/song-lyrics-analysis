Hearts Up Lyrics
by NuLOVE.


Let me talk about something that's important to you.
You selling weed that's the reason why your Jordan's are new.
You know you ain't perfect but shit you're like that on purpose.
And you don't call women hoes unless they fucking deserve it.
But to you most of them do, in which I agree.
Cause geez, these H-O-E-S really be eyeing me.
You had your third eye closed well its finally time to see.
You soft niggas grippin' iron, I'm seeing the irony.
I'm feeling super.
Doing dumb numbers on you I need a tutor.
Spending every nickel and dime like fuck a future..
If she ain't cool with nuLOVE, I throw the two up.
Who up this late? I was prolly a mistake.
Sexual display pelvic thrust her hips brake.
Damn I'm in my zone, getting gone call that burglary.
Ride around the town in this broken down Mercury.
Girl just have some courtesy like  who am I?
If you knew this life you would've committed suicide.
You would've committed suicide.
If you knew this life you would've committed suicide.
Stare into the eyes of a nigga on the come up.
Be a witness to my story, I'm a victim to the glory.
Now Imma empty outta forty.
For all my niggas that won't live to see their forties.
Your status said that you ball hard.
Next day seen your dumbass in the back of a squad car.
Oh but I forgot you really 'bout that life and shit.
Naw my nigga you just ruining your life and shit.
But Imma let it be cause I ain't the one to preach.
You niggas out here in these fucking streets.
You can't change the ghetto the ghetto will change you.
Have you ever witness angels and demons in the same room.
You ever play a game of cards and your hand change suits.
Like a white man change suits? And your chain hang low.
And that girl about to blow like Kurt Cobaines brains go?
You tryna get a taste of fame I want my name stained gold.
Girly I'll blow your mind, surely we on the grind.
What you think is the reason that we putting in overtime.
Don't keep it on the DL, my shit is up for DL.
All my niggas and the females I wanna see you all.

Throw your mother fucking hearts up in the sky if you can feel it.
Throw your mother fucking hearts up in the sky if you can feel it.
Throw your hearts up in the sky if you can feel it.
Throw your hearts up in the sky if you can feel it.
Boycott,  nuLOVE.
Thats what it is.
Thats what it is.
