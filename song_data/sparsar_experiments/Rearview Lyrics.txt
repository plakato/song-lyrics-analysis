Rearview Lyrics
by World's Fair.


They ask Me, Why you always Flex your Gold?
Tell em' I'm just being Me.
Trynna write myself in the Books of Musical History.
These Thoughts of a nightmare.
I Toke to calm aggression.
Now that I Think about it I should Smoke to treat the pressure.
Second guessing.
Every Move I make.
Everything I Buy.
Will these people Love my Music?
If not I might as well Die.
I do this shit to help em' get through whatever they goin' through.
I ask the Lord, what would he do?
But in the meantime.
Catch me cruisin' with my bitch ridin' shotgun.
She rollin' up a shotgun.
Smokin' till her brains are blown.
All over the back-seat of this Honda.
A double suicide from that potent.
Feeling so euphoric.
With her Blonde hair n' Blue eyes.
She tells me that the world is mines.
Tell her that the world is hers.
Sittin' back, watching Parisian sunsets.
Middle-fingers to this world.
Full of re-grets.

We doing everything that we must do.
So that we can do the things that we want to.
Some opportunities come once in a life time.
My nigga you can do what you want to.

Now that I'm getting older.
I stop and check my persona.
I'd rather be Malcom, glady.
John Lennon at The Dakota.
Before, I'm just a no one.
Who live for nothin'.
Just fallin'.
I'll make my presence be known.
Leave historical moments.
Don't get hysterical on us.
While I make sense of all this.
A text that left ellipsis, dash, and semi colans.
Live and laugh, knowing that I gotta make it happen.
? like Charlie Chaplin.
I bust my ass.
Bus and Cabin Training round the land.
East Coast, till I'm 1st class planing to Japan.
?
Put myself in a position, where niggas actually listen.
Get famous for playin' different, and matching every statistic.
Looking back like We did it..
And acting on our visions.
The motto.
?

We doing everything that we must do.
So that we can do the things that we want to.
Some opportunities come once in a life time.
My nigga you can do what you want to.

Cody B. Ware.
Do you think I'm Jesus if I save you?
Would you rather a tale of Love &amp; Lust or do you prefer ? a Fable.
?
Laid across that dinner table.
Food for thought, I brought-it.
Hope you digest, my progress.
Its funny when that money doesn't come.
Cause you was like Fuck it.
It don't matter.
Think about it.
I look at my bitch and rap my mink around her.
She swallow gold, I cut her open then I drink it out her.
We brand new but I wish she saw the way I think about her.
Admire women, with a vision, counting every dollar.
I carry crosses on my back.
Made of platinum plaques.
Sack of doubts, I doubt, you really wanna have her back.
Visions of a G.
Allegedly their legends but a legend would be me.
They bought their way to heaven but I'd never Pay the fee.

Fuck with me.

We doing everything that we must do.
So that we can do the things that we want to.
Some opportunities come once in a life time.
My nigga you can do what you want to.
