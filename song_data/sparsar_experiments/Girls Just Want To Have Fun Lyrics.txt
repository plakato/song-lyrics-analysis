Girls Just Want To Have Fun Lyrics
by Russian Red.

I come home in the morning light.
My mother says When you gonna live your life right?
Oh, mommy, dear.
We're not the fortunate ones.
And girls.
They wanna have fu-un.
Oh, girls.
Just wanna have fun.

The phone rings in the middle of the night.
My father yells What you gonna do with your life?
Oh, daddy, dear.
You know you're still number one.
But girls.
They wanna have fu-un.
Oh, girls, just wanna have.
That's all they really want.
Some fun.

When the working day is done.
Oh, girls.
They wanna have fu-un.
Oh, girls.
Just wanna have... fun.

Girls.
They want.
Wanna have fun.
Girls.
Wanna have.

Some boys take a beautiful girl.
And hide her away from the rest of the world.
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun.
Oh, girls.
They wanna have fu-un.
Oh, girls.
Just wanna have.
That's all they really want.
Is some fun.

When the working day is done.
Oh, girls.
They wanna have fu-un.
Oh, girls.
Just wanna have... fun.
