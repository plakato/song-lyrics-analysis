Stuck in the Game Lyrics
by 51.50.


Yeah.
You know they got you right.
Yeah man I know.
And you out doing.
The same tham thing.
I ain't tripping though dog.
Just want they want you to do.
Yeah you know.
But hey.
But you know.
The choice is your man.

They never take me alive.
Is what I cried.
Till I fled the scene.
There's more to life.
Than selling dope.
And sipping Hennasy.
How can it be that Im'a enemy.
Don't look at me continually.
Contemplate to get rid of me.
Will I ever see.
Peace in this hood.
To witch I'm calling home.
Cause now in days it just be hard.
To get my money on.
Staying out late at night.
Need some more fetti right.
Living the street life.
Thinking I'm getting game tight.
But partner.
Game is meant for playing for keeps.
And game will ever turn.
Cause even you got to sleep.
See.
I keep saying that I'm cursed.
But the worst is even yet to come.
They give you 3 strikes now.
But wait until its 1.
And 1 time.
They got playing to see.
The reinstated of this ghetto.
Wide slavery.
Prepare to be.
The posse coming up in the game.
Anotha name.
Anotha number.
Now you stuck in the game.
It don't stop.

Feel like a victim in this ghetto trap.
You got me stuck in this system.
Now your stuck in this game.
Feel like a victim in this ghetto trap.
You got me stuck in this system.
Now your stuck in this game.
That's why I....
Feel like a victim in this ghetto trap.
They got me stuck in this system.
Now you got me stuck in this game.
You know I....
Feel like a victim in this ghetto trap.
They got me stuck in this system.
Now you got me stuck in this game.

So now I need to get this job.
So I can put some food on my table.
But black is hard.
Hate this.
But I'm willing and able ling.
But there's these problem.
You see.
I got this felony thang.
And that's the kind of shit.
That throwing off my game.
But what a shame.
They got me straight up.
Stuck in the deal.
Our destiny is to flipping burgers.
Or this clean up shit.
But that ain't me.
So what the fuck will I'ma.
Gonna do.
Go back to school.
Or get this job.
And run for 4 and a few.
I thought you knew.
I ain't going out like that.
I guess ill be anotha victim.
Of these ghetto trap.
I got to stack.
But stacking is what they want me to do.
So they can.
Build up them case.
And watch me fall of like a fool.
I'm just a two.
Sucka man part of the game.
They got my number.
That ass.
They both the same.
Now feel the pain.
I'm sweating.
Stuck in the rain.
Left in the game.
And I'm loosing.
Cause I'm stuck in this game.
It don't stop.

My nigga.
Navel wasn't a quitter.
But then his feelings drove him insane.
You can't change the game.
The game changes name.
The 8 stairs 59826.
Another warrant of the state.
San Quinton state prison.
Now isn't.
Life out ranic.
How quickly be change.
From trying' a.
Making that change.
To only.
Making change.
Of thangs.
They seemed.
To happened to my peps.
You see.
That ain't no job.
About to get you.
What you getting for free.
Well its me.
The ghetto got me game.
But put me on check.
No respect.
The effect.
Is now play with a half deck.
Collective.
It is for my lady on the first see.
Cause I ain't stacking nothing but bills.
Trying to live Quinton.
A fiends.
For the fetti.
But fetti.
Be my down fall.
My future.
I see it all.
Cause I can't forget y'all.
But fuck my whole life.
Standing tall.
Like I should man.
Get used to this fucking pain.
I'm stuck in this fucking game.
Ashamed how a.
Nigga can switch.
From a true G.
The ghetto be playing me.
That jealousy be fatting me.
But I still see.
Blood at the end.
Of this black cause.
Look deep in my black soul.
Shit gotta get better y'all.
But trigger man.
I ain't gonna trip.
I'm gonna handle mine.
Live life on the borderline.
Trying hard not to lose my mind.
To find.
The time.
To combine.
All my skills see.
I'm stuck in the game.
But no devil gonna play me.
Don't stop.

Outtro.

Not a wise choice.
Yeah.
But you gotta deal with it now.
Shit yeah man.
You know.
Ain't no thing but chicken wing.
Partner.
I'm gonna handle mine the best I can.
You know.
Never give up boy.
Yeah right.
Me against the whole world right about now.
Yeah I feel you.
But uh.
You know.
I'm gonna handle my business man.
And deal with this shit.
You know what I'm saying.
Word up.
Right on man.
