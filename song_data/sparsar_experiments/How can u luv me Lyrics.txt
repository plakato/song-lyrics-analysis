How can u luv me Lyrics
by Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

How Can u Luv Me.

How can you love me, when you don't like me, baby?
How can you look at me and not see the lonely tears?
And I don't know what went wrong.
Or why this feeling's gone.
Lonely tears are not better.

How can you love me, when you don't like me, baby?
How can you look at me and not see the lonely tears?
And I don't know what went wrong.
Or why this feeling's gone.
Lonely tears are not better.

How can you love me, when you don't like me, baby?
How can you look at me and not see the lonely tears?
And I don't know what went wrong.
Or why this feeling's gone.
Lonely tears are not better.
