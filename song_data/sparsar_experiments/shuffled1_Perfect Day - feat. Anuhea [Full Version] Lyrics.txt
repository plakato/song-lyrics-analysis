Perfect Day - feat. Anuhea [Full Version] Lyrics
by Awa.

Watching the sunrise  .
Awa  .
My perfect day would be in your arms  .
Anuhea  .
Sharing our dreams  .
S.
Dc  .
And tell me you'll forever be mine  .
My baby, you're perfect to me  .
You have my heart  .
Letting time slip away  .
I te āio o te aroha  .
Show love to me, my honey  .
Echoing your design  .
You're my symphony and I wanna listen  .
Mahalo ke Akua no kēia la  .
I thank the Lord for all His blessings  .
Awa  .
Free and naive  .
Anuhea  .
Com/en/awa-perfect-day-lyrics  .
Hearing sweet melodies  .
Aia au ma na lani  .
Kia kotahi ai te wairua  .
It will never fade away  .
Mo āke tonu  .
You're my perfect day  .
Make love to me, my baby  .

I te āio o te aroha  .
.
So to you, this song I sing  .
And tell me, and tell me you'll forever be mine  .
My perfect day would be you in my arms  .
Singing a love song for you and me  .
Vibin' through the sky  .
Sharing our dreams  .
Me tātari tonu māua'  .
My love will never roam  .
And I don't even wanna try  .
You are my only  .
Komo 'oe i loko o ko'u moe 'uhane  .
Me tātari tonu māua'  .
To be with another guy  .
Feel mellow sun rays slipping through the palms  .
Watching the birds fly by  .
Aia au ma na lani  .
Solely my purpose for living  .
He aloha wela  ko'u mai ke Akua mai la  .
He la hemolele kēia'  .
While drifting deeper into your eyes  .
Anuhea  .
Anuhea  .
Today is ours and no one else's  .
If there's one thing I know  .
Tell me is this love that I'm feeling?  .
Toku whaiāipo, haere mai  .
He la hemolele kēia'  .
