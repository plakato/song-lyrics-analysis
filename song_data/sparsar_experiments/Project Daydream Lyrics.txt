Project Daydream Lyrics
by Voice.

Hear the secret order.
Project daydream has begun.
Deep in your empty mind.
A deadly fear awakes.

Military instruments.
Ready throughout times.
Waiting for your data.
Waiting for the sign.

Helpless souls.
Flying with black wings.
Life and death.
Flashing through your drain.
Broken eyes.
Looking in the mirror.
Search in your mind.
Seeing endless pain.

Forgotten things remembered.
The time to kill has come.
Discover faceless enemies.
Or else we hear your painful moan.
