Slow it Up Lyrics
by UNK.


Do it how you wanna, slow it up, do the Matrix.
Do it how you wanna- do it, do it how you wanna, slow it.
Do it how you wanna, slow it up, do the Matrix.
Play with it, play with it, play with it....

Unk.
Yo, yo.
Smoke mo' kush I'm fucked up, I bounce, then I stop pop and I lean.
I'm on deck, knahmean, DJ Unk, it goes like the weed.
You can bend, yo' knees, then rock yo' hips and do it a lil' slow.
Now freeze, I think, I'm straight, let's roll.
They do it on they tiptoes, snap yo' fingers as the beat goes.
{You-you can Screw it} You can Screw it, slow it up now check that hoe.
Now bring it back  now do yo' thang.
It's Big Ooomp bitch, Southern style it ain't gon' change.
You can blow that hazzzzzee, high like you in space.
Montay on that bass, I speak that shit that make you rock away.
It's DJ Unk, slow it up, shorty known for actin a donkey.
You can do it how you wanna, but it's gotta be funky - yup.

Unk.
Okay! Soon as I hit the stage, they seem amazed.
Diamonds glistenin with the Gucci shades.
Lean to the left while I smoke the haze.
Nigga please~! I'm gettin paid.
Get like me, wanna be like me, slow it up, sip some Hennessy.
Smoke some kush, is you feelin me? Montay make me another beat.
I rock the club, then I'ma rock the streets, Bread Street down at V-103.
Dirty Boys, J. Nitti, C.T., Club Chocolate, Hershey.
By the tap, yep, the Blue Flame, Magic City, let's get it mayne.
Play wit deez, straight get it mayne, do it how you wanna, I'ma make it rain.
Red or blue, pop you one, slow it up, nigga have some fun.
You can bounce, you can lean, it's all on you however it seems.
A-T-L, watch me do it, slow it up, let's get into it.
Big Oomp Records know how we do it, burn it down, now go and Screw it.
