Locomotion (feat. Daddy X & Tri State) Lyrics
by X-Clan.

All aboard! Chuchuga chuga.
All aboard! Chuchuga chuga.

All aboard, freedom train progress.
All aboard as we pierce the darkness.
Bonafide soldiers build through mic check.
We on track for our freedom.
Full steam we push the needles like that.
Locomotion through the microphone cord.
Moving pen has might over the sword.
Freedom train we bust down the doors.
Every race, color, creed that bangs hip hop abroad.
Motivate.

And the tone pioneer on the loose.
I used to shovel the coal now I lamp in the cabooze.
Like the golden goose I give life that makes cream.
When I squat on the track we unique soldierly.
Like I be the answer to what it all means.
Don't quit your day job if you bet against the team.
So lean your whack ass back.
Cause ain't too many in the world throw a dart like Smooth Black.

Demolition man the trailblazer.
Leaving the future in the hands of enlightened consumers.
My style be bendin mikes like the kamasutra.
Full space and full time, diplomatic reducer.
I'm boosting up the standards of the conscious myth.

Don't be coming with info when you're lacking in the ???
We be deep in the underground, world we'll spin.
All aboard, freedom train, everyone all in.

All aboard, freedom train progress.
All aboard as we pierce the darkness.
Bonafide soldiers build through mic check.
We on track for our freedom.
Full steam we push the needles like that.
Locomotion through the microphone cord.
Moving pen has might over the sword.
Freedom train we bust down the doors.
Every race, color, creed that bangs hip hop abroad.
Motivate.

We on a mission to seek truth.
Driven by the visions where we livin we acquire the sweet tooth.
Trapped on tracks through the valley of death.
With a fitted thinking cap like I'm Mitchellin Ness.
Drop jewels and acknowledge the icons abolished.
In the school of hard knocks and didn't make it to college.
We go to war for the innocent victims.

And run a train on the system.
We ain't going for it.
Freedom fighters unite.
For the new Blackwatch.
I'm supplying the sight.
Use mind over matter.
The grind over chatter.
Return to Mecca before you climb on the ladder.
Pay homage and respect to the master molders.
And we carry the torch for the hip hop culture.
Spark with a million pens.
March with a million men.
It's the freedom train, everybody all in.

All aboard, freedom train progress.
All aboard as we pierce the darkness.
Bonafide soldiers build through mic check.
We on track for our freedom.
Full steam we push the needles like that.
Locomotion through the microphone cord.
Moving pen has might over the sword.
Freedom train we bust down the doors.
Every race, color, creed that bangs hip hop abroad.
Motivate.

I'm the conductor Daddy X.
The instructor Brother J put my skills to the test.
Bless the track with some of hip hops best.
So I'm marinated, let my soul do the rest.
And I'm microphone check, yes I'm microphone check.
Yes I dropped out of school in search of independent music.
Hip hop, punk rock, learn how to fuse it.
Rebel music comes in many shapes and sizes.
You know it's real when it bubbles up and rises.
I'm self made, that means I'm self empowered.
A visionary with years of stay power.
I don't cower in a sticky situation.
I hold firm ?? fold my occupation.
Redefine the meaning of an artist ?? label.
We all potters eating from the same table.
Sub noise, got the greatest of all time.
Cause Brother J is like I'm leading this crime.
Respect to the Clan for letting Daddy X shine.
Seeing god in all, recognizing mind.
Revolution sands, we handcraft the design.
To unify cultures, liberate your mind.
We build our foundation one track at a time.
Underground soldiers march down the line.
Attention!

All aboard, freedom train progress.
All aboard as we pierce the darkness.
Bonafide soldiers build through mic check.
We on track for our freedom.
Full steam we push the needles like that.
Locomotion through the microphone cord.
Moving pen has might over the sword.
Freedom train we bust down the doors.
Every race, color, creed that bangs hip hop abroad.
Motivate.
