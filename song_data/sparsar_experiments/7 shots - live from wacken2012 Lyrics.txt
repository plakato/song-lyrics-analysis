7 shots - live from wacken2012 Lyrics
by Volbeat.

Down on his knees he sees the devil weeping/whinging his tongue.
Mr. Cadillac doesn't even know he's been fighting his own.
He's been trying shooting all the angels/devils inside.
Playing around with the good and the evil in his mind.
Alone in the desert and cold so cold.

Driving back to the 10 house city something is wrong.
He found the killer weapon in his car on the floor.
Delusional the blood lost paint his mind in a cave.
Feeding monsters in the back of his head.
Killer, reaper, who are you.
Take a look into the mirror then you will know.
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better.

Welcome to a world of chaos, you've been caught in the light.
Saw the door to the 10 house tale 7 shots in the night.

Standing in the dark and shaking my own hand for a while.
Saw the angel/devil vanished out in the light.
Breathing new air for a day to begin.
Soulless body with an empty shell.
Killer, reaper, who are you.
Take a look into the mirror then you will know.
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better.

The price was high to pay and the memories are all crying like a child.
A reason for all the blood that leaked, and a call up for the wild.
Follow me to relentless street where all pain and love will die.
7 shots in the body fakes well the loaded mind.

Driving back to the 10 house city something is wrong.
He found the killer weapon in his car on the floor.
Delusional the blood lost paint his mind in a cave.
Feeding monsters in the back of his head.
Killer, reaper, who are you.
Take a look into the mirror then you will know.
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better.

Welcome to a world of chaos, you've been caught in the light.
Saw the door to the 10 house tale 7 shots in the night.
