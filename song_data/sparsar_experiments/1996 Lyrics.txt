1996 Lyrics
by The Wombats.

I had no cares in the 1990's.
I knew of no downfalls.
Though war was breaking out all around me.
My concerns were with prank calls.

She kissed me on the cheek, she kissed me on the cheek.
Right in front of the older kids.
When our self belief, our self belief.
Wasn't scarred by the modern itch.

Cause now it feels like.

We kiss with one eye on our TV sets.
And the more I give the less I get.
Needing fairground rides, just to spark a smile.
There's little here to miss....

Bring back 1996.
Bring back 1996.
So hard to beat those teenage kicks.
Bring back 1996.

We were cloning sheep in the 1990's.
We were building telescopes.
And sugar filled the whole of my body.
As I urged it on to grow.

I kissed her on the cheek, I kissed her on the cheek.
Just to impress the older kids.
But my self belief, my self belief.
Wasn't lost in the modern glitch.

Cause now it feels like.

We kiss with one eye on our TV sets.
And the more I give the less I get.
Needing fairground rides, just to spark a smile.
There's little here to miss....

Bring back 1996.
Bring back 1996.

Stop talking, you won't stop talking.

I need a lover not a friend tonight.
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

I'm not cut out for the modern life.

I'll never beat those 1990's kids.

I'll never beat those teenage kids.

I'll never beat those teenage kids.
Dalala, la, la, la....
Bring back 1996.
Dalala, la, la, la....

Laughter.
