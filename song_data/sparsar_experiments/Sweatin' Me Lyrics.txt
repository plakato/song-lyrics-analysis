Sweatin' Me Lyrics
by Questionmark Asylum.


Stop sweatin' me.
Tic toc ya don't stop.

Sweating me.
Leaving me.
Drenched.
Caught up in the stench of the high.
I'm not the type to front like I'm the overnight fo' sho' shot.
Ra got more knots, many never know not.
What?
Lick the sweat off me butt.
Rasta's in galoshes.
Sprayin' Dior antiperspirant.
It'll be no worse when.
?
Simply blinded by the glare of a star from afar.
A c'mon y'all.
I'm cool as a fan.
Sweat me like a gland.
I can tell you're workin' but would you really understand.

Stop sweatin' me.
Tic toc ya don't stop.

Now undercover friends that seemed to sneak back into my life.
Yeah, after my days of livin' trife.
Mistafiss ain't the one though.
So I had to play 'em like a game of Nintendo.
First they tried to diss the.
Now they pissed the.
Mistafissta.
They irritating like a blister.
Oh why?
I don't know.
You get's none from this man.
I thought I'd let you know.

We gonna come into your town.
You're gonna look and stare us down.
You wanna sweat the Q&amp;A.
Hey, hey it's okay.

Stop sweatin' me.
Tic toc ya don't stop.

Now me, I, see my friends that want to be my.
Friend.
Now I don't really wanna seem I'm all that.

Now why would you sweat the Rasta like a sauna?

Stop sweatin' me.
Tic toc ya don't stop.

Sometimes I wonder x12.

We gonna come into your town.
You're gonna look and stare us down.
You wanna sweat the Q&amp;A.
Hey, hey it's okay.

Tic toc ya don't stop.
