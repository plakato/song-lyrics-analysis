Red Light Lyrics
by X-Ray.

Reinhold Wiklander.
Fuck you I come around like what goes around! Anyone who steps up must go.
down! Anything that comes up must go down! Might as well dig for heaven! I'am.
not let up! I'ma not let down! Not gonna let you breath! Last shot, better.
give it all you got! Turn me down bitch, fuck all you snobs! Hose is out! Why.
the fuck would I think of you when I palm it? Lucky fuck I do when I vomit.
cause you make sick to my stomach! This is my music, my mic talk! You better.
suicide homie! Throw me off my balcony, cause my parents fucking hate me! And.
it's great cause I don't pretend! First part here's the end! In 3,2 fucking.
bitch bend! I don't have time for this shit!

Reinhold Wiklander.
This is it, last straw! That's all, that's it! You think all I do is stand.
here and scratch my nuts! Yeah now I'ma show you what! You gon' feel my rush!
I think I'ma walk into the wall if I'll see my parents alcoholic shits! I feel.
like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks! I keep rapping fuck you mom I don't.
care if its half past 1! Now it's 2,3,4! Don't care I stay up fucking cunt.
whore! I feel like I'm covered in cement! I don't have any confidence shit!
Only white rapper with a donkey dick! This rap shit, i should conquer it! I.
can't keep staring at this wall and shit! When I'm bored i always spit! if not.
i just swallow it!Always screaming and arguing! I'm so bad I can slap you over.
a compliment! I can find you anywhere, doesn't matter which fucking continent!
I'm sick of all this shit! Liquor filters up! I can feel I'm bout to kill it!
Can feel it building up! Blood pressure climbing up! Getting over my head with.
this depression, should be fucking depressurized! Over aggression and one.
fucking facial expression! Describes me, at least for this rap-session! I.
catch you lying to a bitch, you think you fly, you just fool. I know the.
flyin' fuckas and it ain't you cause it's fucking superman dude!

Reinhold Wiklander.
Somedays I just wanna cock it so it finally quits! Trynna fight it and I fall.
in pits! I don't feel anything, cause my life is shattered in a pile of bits!
You don't feel what I say cause it's to real to touch! Fuck now I'm stuck,.
wait here is something! Not good enough, it's too fucking much! Im bout to.
tear shit up! Fucking goose bumps yeah! I'ma make your hair stand up! That's.
right stand up! Fucking bimbo wanna piece of mind? Here's a piece of mind! All.
I need is a starting line! But there's that one time where I can't find the.
word to rhyme! Fucking X-Ray ain't a quitta! I'm just a Friday night home.
sitta! Mom, dad keeps leaving, he said he'd be back. He fucking pinky.
promised! I don't think he's honest! Apathetic like Bruce Bane, you can tell.
it right of the bat! No pun intended but I'll be done. Just gotta beat the.
time, fuck this clock! I'ma make you eat this watch, don't believe me, watch!
I'm 200 degrees over my boiling point! Wanna fight bitch come get destroyed!
I'ma win this race and come back and wipe my shit in your face bitch! I'm bout.
to explode. I've been sealed enough! I'm desperate on my desk Trynna get shit.
off my chest! I found my meaning, your gonna hear my voice 'til your sick of.
it, your not gonna have a choice! Even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive! Still.
if I have half a chance I'll grab it! It's my bad habit! It's my fucking life.
I command it, I choose fucking left or right! I choose who to fucking bite and.
your in my fucking red light!
