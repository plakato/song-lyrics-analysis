Because I Do Lyrics
by X.

I am a black and white ghost.
In a black and invisible dress.
Oh, what a mess I'm in.
What kind of fool am I.
I am the married kind.
The kind that said I do.
Forever searching for someone new.
At night I get drunk and fly around.
In the day I dream and lay around.
I drink and smoke your brand and drink.
I am drunk over you.
I am the married kind.
The kind that said I do.
Forever searching someone new.
I am the ghost of all my dreams.
To me, it's all pretend.
I pretend I'm alive or just not dead.
I will die for you.
I am the married kind.
The kind that said I do.
Forever searching for someone new.
My nights are numbered.
They don't count for nothing.
I'm not a fool, I'm just a bride.
I'm just no good inside.
I am the married kind.
The kind that said I do.
Forever searching for someone new.
