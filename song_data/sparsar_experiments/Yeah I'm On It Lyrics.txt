Yeah I'm On It.
Yeah I'm On It.
Yeah I'm On It.
Yeah I'm On it.

Aye these niggahs Ain't on it Like That.
Dirty money wired tap and all my bitches count racks.
We be in the club blowing on the kush pack.
Popping bottles with my niggahs tell lil mamma bring it back.

Aye these niggahs Ain't on it Like That.
Dirty money wiretap and all my bitches count racks.
We be in the club blowing on the kush pack.
Popping bottles with my niggahs tell lil mamma bring it back.

I Tell Lil mamma bring iiiiitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.

I Tell Lil mamma bring iiiiitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.

Well if you on it bring it Backkkk.

Walk around the club, Stunt'n like ball.
Money money money make these bitches fall out.
Me and stunt man did the rain dance, whoa that's a hundred thous.
Blowing on PB supreme gas prices stinking up the crowd, wow.

Switch Floz, Ill-O, Ivo, Heedi Blacc, and Lotto G.
Got racks on top of racks is like we hit the lottery.
Im dress in all black a homicide, robbery.
Ain't no cuff'n in the club I ask her why she ice'n me.

I told her, Freeze  please  take a picture cheese.
Mommie on patron Im on that O.E. 18.
Jose Cuervo, ivanabitch, with a little ciroc and sprite white Hennessy.
Foreign rides all these foreign broads on me tell a bitch bring it back like.
ven aqu√≠.

Aye these niggahs Ain't got no racks.
Money wiretap man they say I count rats.
We be in the club blowing on the kush pack.
Popping bottles with my niggahs tell lil mamma bring it back.

I Tell Lil mamma bring iiiiitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.

I Tell Lil mamma bring iiiiitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.

Well if you on it bring it Backkkk.

I been had a check paper cuts yeah Im on it.
Got to grind like strippers so you know Im on it.
Got work for a hater, tell em fill out an app.
Oh you just cop that well we been up on it.

This fresh, success.
Being broke ain't a option I refuse to be on it.
Had to hop off that cause yo ass up on it.
Grave em a dose of the swag, now they all up on it.

this the motto for my people.
We flip it like c notes, cause I match it like bingo.
Im sticking to my g-code.
So blue up like my prmo they checking out my lingo.

Cause Im fresh up, Cleaned up.
If she ain't down, to get down.
Hasta luego, all my bills be paid for.
Yeah they claim they on it but we dont really think so, Yurrr!
