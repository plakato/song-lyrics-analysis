Gettin' Hot Lyrics
by The Runaways.


With every beat of my heart, it's getting dark.
There's something in the air.
The doors aren't locked, you know it's not.
But I just know you're somewhere.
Hands on the table, are they empty got a fable.
Is it true?
Say he's coming, no one said a word.
They've gotten through.

It's such a crush, it's getting hot.
Temperature's rising it's getting hot.

Shot a single word for telling true.
I can hear him pant.
I wanna leave but I just can't breathe free.
If they begin their chant.

It's such a crush, it's getting hot.
Temperature's rising it's getting hot.

Church is breaking, my body's shaking.
I just can't tell.
He's coming back my head is black.
He must be under a spell.

It's such a crush, it's getting hot.
Temperature's rising it's getting hot.
