Angelina Lyrics
by Ryan Adams.

Johnny held a picture of you.
Yeah he kissed it and threw it away.
Discarded on the avenue.
Just like all those letters that you threw away.

Oh, Angelina, you lied.
Oh, Angelina, you did it and smiled.
Oh, Angelina, you went to the town hall dance.
With your hair pulled back and a dress.

Johnny took an airplane back.
Shuffled his feet on the street in L.A.
Two hundred dollars and a gunny sack.
He bought a guitar and sang with a band.

And he sang:.
Oh, Angelina, you lied.
Oh, Angelina, you did it and smiled.
Oh, Angelina, you went to the town hall dance.
With your hair pulled back and a dress.

Well job's hard enough when you ain't got a girl.
And the weekend won't leave you alone.
And with money to spare and with nights at the end.
Till he ends up at a pay telephone.

Said:.
Oh, Angelina, you lied.
Oh, Angelina, you did it and smiled.
Oh, Angelina, you went to the town hall dance.
With your hair pulled back and a dress.
Oh, Angelina, you lied.
Oh, Angelina, you did it and smiled.
Oh, Angelina, I'm tired, it's the end of the night.
Yeah, it's the end of the line.
