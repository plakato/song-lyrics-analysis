Drop It - x2 Lyrics
by Wonder Broz.


She gon' drop it on me, drop it on me yeah.
Do it like that.
And girl you in the league, you finna' win me yeah.
You keep moving like that.
Drop it for a real nigga.
Drop it for a real nigga.
Drop it for a real, drop it for a real nigga.
Drop it for a real nigga.
Drop it for a real nigga, Huh.

They all know, know me.
Two braids, East Side, Long Beach.
Everybody in the town my homies.
But the way you get it you my only.
Got the kid horn, add a Y.
Treat her like my child, keep her in my side.
I rock that thang like a lullaby.
She my loan, no cosign.
Get it.
If not, it's all good.
I like 'em ghetto, straight from the hood.
I'll save that thing she misunderstood.
No question 'bout it, I know I would.
Mommy hips made for a hula hoop.
She on tonight, them hips don't lie, they tell the truth.
When she dip look what the booty do.
Her and her friend they booties ? Mm.

Hold on,  grab tight.
Hips like handle bars on motorbikes.
She alright, she cool.
I seen better, nigga who?
Sike! I play that role.
It's my joystick so I'm in control.
Hit 'er with that D, make her office full right?
That stank don't it.
She act like she don't, but that cat want it.
Got her man yelling, I be dog on it.
He mad cause he see the dog on it.
It is what it is, got her wanting the jiz.
Mami got a taste for the kids, I ain't judging her biz.
Now he know it ain't his.
Scratch him off the list.
