Climax Lyrics
by Big Season Muzik.


I see you in the bar looking at me/Baby, I can tell that you're, horny 
Your man, don't wan na give you what you want/Some good, making love sex that's
all. You want 
He, leaving you all alone up in here/Don't, worry about him, Big, Daddy, Season's
here 
Look. I know he's your so-called lover/But. How deep is your love for a nigga 
I know you want him, but you need me/I know you wan na sex. Someone like me, 
I, don't care if your man got ta know/I wan na lick, you from your head to your
toe 
You feeling me, and I know you like it/You gon na love it when I get up on it 
Now when I hit it from back/I'll, make you Reach to your climax, 
 
Now, we in the hotel doing freaky things/Season is the name you'll be
screaming 
I'm, the type of guy that can keep you satisfied/Girl. Your pussy is what I
 wan na ride 
Like Silk. Let me freak you up and down/I wan na lick, your body round and round 
I'm gon na make. You feel good between the sheets/No room service cause your
body gon na be the feast 
I can go deeper than that nigga can/Licking. On my neck call me your candyman 
Since, he ain't shit, I'm your backup/Making love all night'til, the sun, comes
up 
I got you feeling all ecstasy/Call me, Mr Season. If you nasty 
While, I'm hitting it from the back/Still I'mma, make you reach to your climax. 
 
I see you talking body language to me/Thinking, about freaking you like Jodeci, 
Making love to you is something I'll. Never regret/I made you all hot and wet 
We made love all night. All day/That wasn't a 12 play. That was some 24 play
 
Ooh. Your love taste like waterfall/All the places I'd kiss you like Aaron
Hall 
You, got me feening like a motherfucker/Damn. We took it nice and slow like
Usher 
Licking your body with whipped cream/Keeping, your body warm and steam 
Since. Your man didn't do shit/I'm. So glad that you let me hit it, 
That was some good sex/I can see why your name is Climax.
