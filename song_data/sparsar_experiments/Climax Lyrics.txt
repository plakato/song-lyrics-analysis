Look, I know he's your so-called lover/But, how deep is your love for a nigga.
I know you want him, but you need me/I know you wanna sex someone like me.
I don't care if your man gotta know/I wanna lick you from your head to your.

You feeling me and I know you like it/You gonna love it when I get up on it.
Now, when I hit it from back/I'll make you reach to your climax.

I got you feeling all ecstasy/Call me Mr Season, if you nasty.

I see you talking body language to me/Thinking about freaking you like Jodeci.
Making love to you is something I'll never regret/I made you all hot and wet.
We made love all night, all day/That wasn't a 12 play, that was some 24 play.

Ooh, your love taste like waterfall/All the places I'd kiss you like Aaron.

You got me feening like a motherfucker/Damn, we took it nice and slow like.

Licking your body with whipped cream/Keeping your body warm and steam.
Since your man didn't do shit/I'm so glad that you let me hit it.
That was some good sex/I can see why your name is Climax.
