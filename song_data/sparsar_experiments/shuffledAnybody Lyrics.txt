Anybody Lyrics
by B-Real.

Inside yo dope, pickin' yo brain  .
Many say that we all gave up unconditional love  .
Use to put me on speed dialin'  .
You might be police or the federales  .
You might be police or the federales  .
Light it up and it symbol tation  .
With ribbon stashed in her purse  .
  .
Tie it up when I hang that green  .
How you gonna smoke when you broke yo neck?  .
Don't play around, clear the block  .
Swift line, I don't play around  .
Tick-tock, ziplock, full of vegetation, inspiration  .
Round and round we go when em thangs pop.
Round and round we go with em gaze up  .
What he want? What he hit?  .
We motivate with that head bang  .
I don't make no deal with just anybody  .
And talk that shit right in your face  .
Bitch, keep away from my clothes  .
Into Fort Knox and this shit so faithful  .
Don't believe me? You can ask Snoop Lion  .
My team protectin' my dome  .
  .
He always keep that filly litch  .
Shootin' stars, give it yo pain  .
.
Lay down, stay down  .
  .
My queen can sit on my throne  .
Indoor smoke, like that flavor  .
Got the ratchet ass first  .
I'm a east side Small Beach, gangbang affiliate  .
They be wantin' that good Buddha  .
She be stackin' up fud   .
You silly bitch, I know yo name  .
They be up on my weedstop  .
You might be police or the federales  .
I bust with the K clip, bitch  .
I be stalkin' that green light  .
I loose up next when the dro's on deck  .
That's real shit  .
Both hands up like 12 o'clock  .
  .
International, sensational, we be usin' all recreational  .
And I put it under funky feel tip  .
Look at the plane, keepin' the game  .
Still a part of that hall of fame  .
Round and round we go when em thangs pop  .
I came in the place to do my thang and pump the bass  .
Gravitation, nigga don't say shit  .
Pick up the heat, now pick up the pace  .
Round and round we go with em gaze up  .
Who be rollin' with the tangerine  .
It's in yo face when I smoke the set  .
I don't make no deal with just anybody  .
Might bring to offer my phone  .
They come to me for that therapy  .
Round and round we go when em thangs pop  .
Say waddup with that G life: God is good, man ungrateful  .
Then I roll it up and then I smoke it up  .
Got no respect, you're so upset  .
I don't make no deal with just anybody  .
Quit the chainin', then I make the lamin', then I hit the blamin'  .
This stuff was always on call  .
  .
  .
Don't care of bein' in line first  .
Round and round we go with em gaze up  .
