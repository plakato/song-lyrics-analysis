Jollity Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


Bitch give me head what you thinkin 'bout that.
We can take a couple pills, sip a little then we trashed.
I got weed and i'm cashed gimme pussy and some ass.
I got drugs up in my system I been loaded since the past past.

Drugs up in my system I been loaded since youth.
If you wanna fuck with me then boy you leave without a tooth.
I been rappin' in the booth.
Smoking spliffs with all my boo's.
Pop a Xanax then we trippy bitch I represent my crew, uh.

Bitches get to painting like it's Pay 'n' Spray, we banging.
Carl Johnson on my pager saying I could get away.

Make my moves and then I play.
Bitches lose and then they hate.
I be that ballin' mothafucka sippin' codeine with the haze, aye.

Bitch give me head what you thinkin 'bout that.
We can take a couple pills, sip a little then we trashed.
I got weed and i'm cashed gimme pussy and some ass.
I got drugs up in my system I been loaded since the past past.
