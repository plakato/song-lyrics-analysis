Hype Boys Lyrics
by Sway UK.


Hype boys, hype boys, everyone's a killer.
Drug dealer with a nine mill-a.
That's not sensible, and I can sense the bull.
That's why these rappers couldn't see me coming.
If they were vaginas, with spectacles.
And I've got the testicles to testify the truth.
Half these rappers are only gangsters in the booth.
And they ain't never been to no Pen, they just hold one.
Me, I be no gangster, I'm just telling you the truth.
But I run up in the game like Bang bang bang bang.
That's why, that's why everybody keeps saying.
Have you heard Sway? He's Nang nang nang nang.
That guy that guy's heavy in the game.
And I've said: why buy this Fe-Fi-Fo?
But them guys could never defeat my flow.
Sway, all the way from the U to the K.
Roll up with Bacardi in the tee-total.
Getting over the CDs I've sold in it.
I don't want them to know that's the gold, innit?
That's the goal, innit?
Half the haters they ain't doing nothing with a mic but holdin' it, they slow.
with it.
So they could never bring the game into the new school.
I play too brutal.
Plus I'm out of control like a cross-eyed teacher's pupil.
People down in England ain't all wild.
But some places in Britain ain't the place to raise your child.
Cos even the royal family ain't all smiles.
Cos everybody knows, Harry don't look like Charles.
See me, I've never been to court.
And I've never been on trial, boy.
Never been caught even though I've been around, boy.
What's that thing in your hand? Put it down, boy.
Cos you're not a killer, you're a sound boy.

Hype boys, hype boys.

On the mic boys, mic boys.

And the semi goes bratatatatatatatata.
And the semi goes ratata, bang, bang.

The pound is stronger than the dollar, holla.
Sway, I ran up in this game like a robber without a rubber.
And now I been around and I'm pro.
Won a couple of awards, now a round of applause.
And now I'm making Ps and I'm pleasing my people.
Not even a Jamiroquai hat could fit my ego.
‘Nuff of these rappers ain't real, they're just rapping hype.
Why you shouting all the time? Don't you have a mic?
Run up in the club like, be-ow, be-ow.
Bust two lyrics then, we out, we out.
Them boys talk too lee-oud, lee-oud.
But they puss like, meow, meow.
And they don't really want no war time.
This rap game is all mine.
It will never be your time, allow it, bruv, 'cos you're small time.
And I got more time, so settle down, boy.
Before I make you look like something like a clown, boy.
What's that thing in your hand? Put it down, boy.
Cos you're not a killa, you're a sound boy.

Are you a liar? If your reply is no,.
you're lying now.
Because we live in a lie.
And then we die and then we're lying down.
Look at my Adam's apple, it's not that my neck hurts.
No, no, it's just the truth is hard to swallow.
And you can see that I'm an expert.
So let, let me elaborate as I navigate, like a husky.
But trust me, the truth is, I wouldn't even trust me.
Many rely in religion, that doesn't make sense.
Cause that's considered a sin.
It is really no winning cause every one harbors a liar within them, it's just.
that we're different.
Being a bad liar is like having a bad lawyer.
As soon as they get caught they get the sentence uffed up.
A good liar's benevolent, with a memory like an elephant.
Intelligent, and knows exactly when to shhhhh.
Lies spread around like viruses, so how can I survive in this?
Cause even the truth lies  – in people's irises.

Got my talent for twisting words.
Hence my title, I'm a liericist.
When you work the people don't want to leave alone.
Cause you gotta make money, you don't need the loan.
I'm a businessman underneath the foam.
But you lie to the people and lead them on.
You're not a bad boy, no, I got a bad boy flow.
Cos when in Rome you do what the Romans do.
Especially when all roads lead to Rome.
You need to stop pretending. Your mixtapes are still in boxes cause you don't.
have a fan in your bedroom.
What's that thing, in your hand? Put it down, boy.
Cause you're not a killa, you're a sound boy.
