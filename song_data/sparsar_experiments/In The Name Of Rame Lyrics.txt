In The Name Of Rame Lyrics
by 3X Krazy.

**.

Oooooooh!

In the name of Raymond,  he was a smooth talker. Street balla.
Oooh ghetto soldier.
I can't get over, losin, Rame, Rame, Rame.

Uh.
The Town is shifted like a pier.
An niggas who got fear, of blastin, you too near.
I've seen big time ballas get took out the game.
Of playa hater-izm, victim, but not my nigga Rame.
Sharper than a Gillette.
'specially in a Vet.
Always known to swang.
They hate to see a young nigga havin thangs.
But couldn't stop, get it off faster than he could chop it.
Told me one day, if we wasn't signed then he would drop it.
I peeped the realest, and was choosed.
Had love so I only bought bomb from 7-duce.
15 for a drop.
An a dub, click, boxin up trouble an the next nigga ho.
I heard they tried to kill my folks, now what they do that for?
It's all wrong.
See all the lovin got my playa potna strong.
He loved that Krazy click.
So I dedicate this song in the name of Rame.
A true, blue soldier in this skrilla makin deep game.
Still they ain't never been linked.
A potna infatrated, another potna that's major deep.
Was on the creep.
Pass me the bomb so I can hit, cuz who ever did it.
They gotta know, and die wit it.
In the name of Rame.

** x2.

I remember back when I was dealin crack.

Even the roaches and the rats through the cealing cracks.
Knots whistlin his name through abandoned shacks.

But I would be a fool to let it hold me back.
In the name of Rame.

It's too much sorrow in my city an it hurts.
One loved to rap, movin them thangs in the game like EA Sports.
Takin no losses or no shorts.
But what came first, struck wit a ghetto curse.
Another victim, acquit them of playa haters thirst, but at first.
It was all laughs.
Breakin up them stacks of cash.
Livin life slowly, tryin to get rich fast was all I had.
It's gang-related, I seen it comin.
Watch niggas start hatin that day when he flipped that box in the vet.
Bumpin.
Nobody seen it, but it's our hood.
I figure them bitches who did it consider it all good, but y'all would.
Wanna live like shade.
Get strapped in the game, an take my potna 'fo his last days.
Think you've got it made?
Nigga ain't no runnin back.
When I put this gun in yo back.
Detach 'em, attack 'em, to the point no picture come at ya.
Put the pistol hold up on his shoulder crystal clear.
Slit him ear to ear, down to the rear, countin in this hemisphere.
So fear me dear.
I hit 'em up hard where it hurts.
Then put yo dick in the dirt.
The Flow-to-the-Matic-Nina works, but some bomb in a blunt can't keep me.
Perked.
I need a fifth of gin.
Not bust a blunt again.
My friend every corner I bend, I'm thinkin bout Rame to the very end.
So now it's all in his name.
A true, blue soldier.
In this skrilla makin, deep game.

**.

I know he's tired of the pain, but he gotta keep hustlin.
Wit two daughters of his own, and can't be left out strugglin.
Got to raise a family, so he's pullin 24's.
Dope houses full of hoes, hennessey, dank, money and clothes.
Task kickin in doors.
Hit the back door, they gonna be chasin.
Crooked cops tryin to set him up for beatin all the cases.
An if he go to jail, next day he post bail.
Then go back to the spot, to set back up shop to make that mail.
Day by day livin.
An nobody don't want no static.
A-P 9 in the attic.
Five stripes, I'm wreckin traffic.
Pullin a G daily.
Watch how I pull these snitches.
Suckas hatin, and wishin.
Hoes on the ground from hittin fences.
The real deal.
Peep how others do it juss to chill.
But he be on the block hustlin tryin to pay them bills.
Flipped him a Vet an he was ridin wit the skirt-skirt.
Hittin corners showin them hatas what the Turf is worth.
Showin love to his folks, and tryin to make a dolla.
Here's a blunt, let's get smoke that's what I heard him holla.
Even though me and Raymond didn't have the same mother.
I always looked up to him as being my brother.
In the name of him.
