Air Balloon Lyrics
by Vixen.

Well, he was a bore and she needed more.
And so she took a train.
To the coast of Maine.
And she dove right in.
It took a while to notice.
That she was gone for good.
Now everyday he takes sometime to play.
And he's better man.

I'm floating away in this air balloon.
I thought if you came.
That we could chase the moon.
Imagine if you can, if you can.
We're floating away, we're floating away.

I saw an old man in Texas.
He was singing songs out in the street.
During the second song.
He moved his mouth a little wrong.
And his teeth fell out.
Then he says to me:.
Don't you hate it when that happens?
I said, I really wouldn't know.
He said, Sooner or laterit falls apart.
And maybe sooner than you think.

In my airballoon.
We're floating away, we're floating away.
