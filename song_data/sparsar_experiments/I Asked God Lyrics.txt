I Asked God Lyrics
by Quelle Chris.

Quelle Chris.

Yo, I look up to the sky and ask God what to do?
He said Get mooney!
I said Aight true.
I said What's the meaning of life?
He said Man, Q, I been tryna figure that one out, just like you,.
I said How you not know? You the one that put us here,.
He said Think about y'all, and all the kids that you bear,.
I'm like Ain't you god?!
He said Ain't you gods too?
I'm like Ain't you god?!
He said Ain't you gods too?

I'm kinda geeked.
I ain't hardly eat.
A little pot to keep me higher than an ostrich beak.
I done heard a lot of speak but ain't seen a lot of growth.
I'm sensing a whole lot of grief but hearing a lot of hope.
What's really going on?
Seems like yesterday everything's where it belongs.
Like something went wrong.
Same old song.
Shave, shit, shower, something felt gone.
Maybe its the drink, maybe need to put down the bottle, maybe I'm drunk.
Maybe its the weed, maybe stop hitting them high notes.
Or maybe I'm stuck right now.
Maybe I'm high off life in a room all alone getting crunk right now.
I don't need lows feeling up right now.
Nigga might cut the bass from the trunk right now.
Gotta hush right now, cause a nigga living life on the rush right now.
Think the worlds got me in a clutch right now.
Gotta find me an angel that I can touch right now.

And the world kept turnin'.
And the paper kept burnin'.
And the drinks kept flowin'.
And the party keep goin'.
And the bills stay comin'.
Til the bodies stop runnin'.
Then the paper kept turnin' n the world kept burnin'.

I look up to the sky and ask God what to do?
He said Get mooney!
I said Aight true.
I said What's the meaning of life?
He said Man, Q, I been tryna figure that one out, just like you,.
I said How you not know? You the one that put us here,.
He said Think about y'all, and all the kids that you bear,.
I'm like Ain't you god?!
He said Ain't you gods too?
I asked Ain't you god?!
He said Ain't you gods too?

8 in the morning, woke up prayed for the lord.
Thanks for the ride, thanks for the day.
Thanks for the good and the bad times.
Shit, thanks for the times.
Stretch til I yawn, roll over reach for the bong.
Spark up dala.
Soul in the song.
Spirit exists in the song.
Now I'm alive.
