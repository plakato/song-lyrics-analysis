You know that it's forever girl, 
Yeah bitch yeah 
Ay ay ay. You know that it's forever girl 
It's forever baby 
 
She crazy. She sexy she cool. She. Let me 
Ride it all night, and then she give me that TLC 
Fuck you niggas gon', tell me Throw my money. Might as well be 
Cause, I'm out chea out chea and i'll only dropped one LP 
I couldn't let a girl like you pass 
I would trade. My seat to coach to let you ride first class 
We straight to the bank. Fifty G's, let it burn 
They, say time is money. Well, you ain't got ta earn that 
 
You could be my boyfriend. I could be your baby 
Start it off slow and see where we could take it 
Anything. You do boy got me so crazy, ...

And. Now I got you in my life. I'Mma love. You forever

Fuck her all night and make her cum at the count of 3 
Fuck you niggas gon', tell me throw my money. Might as well be 
Cause, I'm out chea out chea and i'll only dropped. One LP 
I couldn't let a girl like you pass 
I, would trade my seat to coach to let you ride first class 
We straight to the bank. Fifty G's, let it burn 
They, say time is money. Well, you ain't got ta earn that .
 
You could be. My boyfriend, I could be your baby 
Start it off slow and see where we could take it
