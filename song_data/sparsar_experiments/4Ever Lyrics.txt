4Ever Lyrics
by Yung Berg.


You know that it's forever girl.
Yeah, bitch, yeah.
Ay ay ay you know that it's forever girl.
It's forever baby!

She crazy, she sexy, she cool, she let me.
Ride it all night and then she give me that TLC.
Fuck you niggas gon' tell me? Throw my money might as well be.
Cause I'm out chea, out chea and i'll only dropped one LP.
I couldn't let a girl like you pass.
I would trade my seat to coach to let you ride first class.
We straight to the bank, fifty G's, let it burn.
They say time is money well you ain't gotta earn that.

You could be my boyfriend, I could be your baby.
Start it off slow and see where we could take it.
Anything you do boy got me so crazy....
I never thought that I could be in love wit ya never say never.
And now I got you in my life I'mma love you forever.

She crazy, she sexy, she cool, she let me.
Fuck her all night and make her cum at the count of 3.
Fuck you niggas gon' tell me?  throw my money might as well be.
Cause I'm out chea, out chea and i'll only dropped one LP.
I couldn't let a girl like you pass.
I would trade my seat to coach to let you ride first class.
We straight to the bank, fifty G's, let it burn.
They say time is money well you ain't gotta earn that.

You could be my boyfriend, I could be your baby.
Start it off slow and see where we could take it.
Anything you do boy got me so crazy....
I never thought that I could be in love wit ya never say never.
And now I got you in my life I'mma love you forever.
Forever.

I never thought that I could be in love wit ya never say never.
And now I got you in my life I'mma love you forever.

You could be my boyfriend, I could be your baby.
Start it off slow and see where we could take it.
Anything you do boy got me so crazy....
I never thought that I could be in love wit ya never say never.
And now I got you in my life I'mma love you forever.
Forever.
