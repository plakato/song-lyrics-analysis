G'yeah Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


G'eah mayn, this one here.
For you niggas, always in a nigga shit mayn.
Always trying to peep, what a nigga got.
Me myself, I'm a man of few words.
I don't say, too much shit.
So that's why, I got that self explanatory shit.
That shit that's just g'eah, speak for itself.

Yung Ro.
Ay when I spit they like g'eah mayn, that nigga yeah mayn.
He real he just spitting that whoa, I'm like g'eah mayn.
Now look at here mayn, I really don't care mayn.
Maybe cause down here mayn, we trill and let our g'eah hang.
You can feel the blanks, if you peeping field of blanks.
But if you ain't real you can't, you a shotgun but filled with blanks.
You too eager son, ay take it easy son.
Watch how I bring the bread home, get full just leave me one.
Cause that's all I need, ay I'm a hustler poppy.
Two steps ahead of you, I'll thank you plus your muscles sloppy.
Maybe that's why Ro so cocky, life is a hustle copy.
Don't believe set a trend, watch how you hustlers copy.
That's why I hustle properly, grind hard and clutch it softly.
Cause you never know it could g'eah, now did you busters copy.
Hold up shh hush he's cocky, I mean Chamillionaire.
I'm in my Nobody attire, he in Chamillion-wear.
That's du-rags Air Forces, white T's Dickies.
Ay let's wipe these rookies down, g'eah freeze pussies.
I sell you game sell you dope, off of services.
I sell a bitch a dream, and have her offering services.
Ahh fa sho it is, going down daddy's sure.
Locked your girl like daddy's yours, how crunk with a fatty girl.
She be getting mad at your boy, and I be like damn it girl.
Confusion can't stand it girl, catch this back handers yeah.
Don't let me lose you man, the mission's not to lose you man.
Add flame with my movements man, body language move the hands.
Look I got more expenses, grinding can't ignore the tension.
Inside on life not 3D, more like a four dimension.
Wait I got more just listen, it's nothing to score with bitches.
Let em get comfortable, you'll see their whore intentions.
Throwback jersey no, that's a gimmick I'm authentic.
Hat tilted back tilted, like g'eah g'eah g'eah.
Rap switching style switch em, style switching so rap getting.
Very interesting, competitive look I'll get ya.
I'll hit ya like halls hit ya, praise you down crawl with ya.
Then you know what's coming next, g'eah I'm like aww did ya.
Hurt yourself, trying to run with them big ones.
Cause we got them big guns, g'eah who wanna get some.
I got a lot to give, a couple shots to give.
Blocka-blocka g'eah, get off me got a lot to live.
Thoed, ay Ro yo flows.
G'eah I'm like g'eah, motherfucker I know.

My style is like g'eah, my clothes are like g'eah.
My do' is like g'eah, I'm the realest in here.
Show it off like g'eah, play with em like g'eah.
It's easy it's lightweight, holla back daddy g'eah.

Yung Ro.
Say daddy get your stunting up, you tripping with that cheap shit.
Too many rappers wearing grills anyway, you can keep it.
Peep this I'm hot, you can see it in clear view.
Pain the movie starring Yung Ro, in a theater near you.
Ay plus I fuck hoes, they say I'm some'ing like a hero.
I be stroking they be moaning, it do some'ing to my ego g'eah.
I'm the man son, shorty like man son.
I play her like basketball, crossover fade and one.
You will never peep me man, orthodox structured well.
I'll leave you like what the hell, then I'm in the wind like fuck you g'eah.
Fuck the jail fuck the laws, fuck your bullshit indictment.
No warrants give me my license, snatch it like g'eah nigga.
We on Homes Road, racing bikes I'm daring niggas.
Popping wheelies in the air nigga, stunting like g'eah nigga.
Source Awards, they voting who tight us.
We go to the mic trophy, Koopa holding it like g'eah nigga.
After party mami dancing, I'm like you go girl.
She trying to make it stand up, my hands up like g'eah nigga.
Life is good, this is balling at it's finest moment.
Nobody piece with the diamonds on it, flashing like g'eah nigga.

It's nothing Yung Ro, it go down.
This is Undagrind.
