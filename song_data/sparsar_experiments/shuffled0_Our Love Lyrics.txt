Our Love Lyrics
by SykoCutter.

filled with freedom and peace, because frequently, you've been stealing my.
will never be changing, together every moment, my love, I show it, if we ever.
The first day we met, I knew from the start, immediately, I could just shoot.
protection, you took my breath away you were like perfection, my skin turned.
way, in the right direction, where I was destined, you deserve love and my.
floor, because I've never seen a woman so angelic before, as time goes by,.

Our love is important, you know that you're gorgeous, your heart is enormous,.
seperated my life would be hopeless, and my heart would be broken, I think you.
amazing, somebody that no one is replacing, the very moment we met, my heart.

white with a light complexion, it wasn't well to ignore, that I fell to the.
page, something inside of my brain, says it's meant to be, it'll guide me the.
when I told you how I felt, I was shy and afraid, but as I'm writing this.
heart, you own a peace of me.
what you want because you are in charge, I'll make sure that nobody's doing.
for your heart, even though those other guys, blew it apart, I'll give you.
was racing, conversating, as were connecting greatly, I know that my feelings.
should notice, my passion is so deep at each minute I flow this.
and you know that you're more than, worth anything else that I can explain,.
you harm, I'll make sure you no when I'm through with these bars, you're.

before my own sight, I know I've never seen anything like those eyes, I'm.
