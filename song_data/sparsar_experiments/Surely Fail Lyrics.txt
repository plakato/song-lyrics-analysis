Surely Fail Lyrics
by Xeezy.


As I stand before you....
I confess myself disappointed.....
You told me you would be nothing like them.....
That you would be different....
That you would not care about followers.....
About the clothes on your back!
The clothes you wear.....
The shoes on your feet...how many friends you have!
HOW MANY FOLLOWERS YOU HAVE!
Is that what matters....is that what you care about?
Is that what means something to you?
That means nothing to us.....
To us this is just vanity....
Vanity is not allowed where we are from....
Where we are from we are warriors.
Warriors who take everything and give them nothing......
TAKE EVERYTHING!!!!!!

Mama say,son don't put your hat where you can't reach it.
So I placed it to the back,cause my paths the only thing I'm seeing.
I stay dreaming,stay believing,that one day I'd see the ceiling.
O what a feeling,the true meaning,what it means to be a human being.
Leaning on me....ni99a please no Morgan Freeman.
See cause if you ain't the shit..then you must be European!
I'm Caribbean....and I'm proud!
I will scream that shit out loud!
We the ship,we say it sternly,so you best gon take a bow.
Certain shit we don't allow....
You ni99as weight me down like anchors.
But for that I gotta thank yuh,now my solders will out flank yuh.
We out rank,friggin blank yuh.
But yuh better have the answers....
I'm X Malcolm....
I'm X Cancer....
I'm X Atom.....
You no matter...Ha!
What What....let's pause for a second.
Cough Cough..aww he coming in second...place.
Time weights for no man fatty!
I be stunting on you ni99as,now get to stunting like yo daddy....huhhhh.

That's just how I roll.
&amp; that's just how it is....
&amp; I just gotta ask one question....
Can I live?

But I am though....
Buying all these damn clothes....
&amp; I suppose my paper's coming fast like pronto.
I'm the head honcho.
Hmmmmm,I got a hunch though.
My wifey gon be draped in two diamonds like Umbro..Umbro??
Ummm bro...I'm ma make you scream uncle.
I see you swagger jacking,boy your style ain't subtle.
We in the concrete jungle,you bird brain,Tonto.
And my swagger's so clean,that it make your girl bubble.
&amp; I'm humble,but she's trouble...
You better watch her mouth,cause I was just inside her tonsil.
Life's a struggle.....
Bartender a double....D's in my cup..Huh.
So much for being subtle.
She looking supple,she wanna cuddle.
Ni99a please,with the right keys she gon want me up inside of her tunnel.

I make her puddle,make her knee's wobble.
Now she's making waffle's,so I guess that we're a couple?!

Make my waffles for me....
X-tra syrup please....
I want waffles.....
Making me waffles....baby.

What it is what it do...I just wanna hear my ni99as say SWOO.
