Surely Fail Lyrics
by Xeezy.


As I stand before you ... 
I, confess myself, disappointed. ..., 
You told me you would be nothing like them. ... 
That! You would be different, ... 
That! You would not care about followers. ... 
About, the clothes on your back 
The clothes. You wear ... 
The shoes on your feet, ... how many friends you have 
HOW MANY FOLLOWERS. You HAVE 
Is that what matters ..., .is, that what you care about, 
Is, that what means something to you 
That means nothing to us. ... 
To us! This is just vanity. ... 
Vanity is not allowed where we are from ... 
Where we are from. We are warriors 
Warriors who take everything and give them nothing. ... .. 
TAKE EVERYTHING, 
 
Mama, say son. Don'T put your hat where you can't reach it 
So I placed it to the back cause my paths, the only thing I'm seeing 
I stay dreaming stay believing that one day I'd see the ceiling 
O. What a feeling the true meaning, what it means to be a human being 
Leaning on me, ... .ni99a, please, no Morgan, Freeman 
See cause! If you ain't the shit..then, you must be European 
I'm, Caribbean, ..., .and, I'm proud! 
I will scream that shit out loud 
We. The ship we say it sternly, so you best gon, take a bow, 
Certain shit. We don't allow ..., 
You ni99as weight me down like anchors 
But. For that I got ta thank yuh. Now my solders will out flank yuh 
We out rank friggin blank yuh, 
But yuh, better, have the answers: ... 
I'm X, Malcolm ..., 
I'm, X, Cancer, ..., 
I'm, X, Atom, ..., 
You, no matter, ... Ha 
What. What ... .let's pause for a second 
Cough Cough..aww? He coming in second ... place: 
Time weights for no man, fatty 
I, be stunting on you. Ni99As now get to stunting like yo, daddy, ..., .huhhhh
 
That's, just how I roll
