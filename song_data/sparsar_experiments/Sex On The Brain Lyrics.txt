Sex On The Brain Lyrics
by Questionmark Asylum.


The music just turns me on 
, 
Ee, ya, ya, ya, ooh, ya, 
Ee, ya, ya, ee, ya, ya, 
 
I got sex on the brain. I don't be faking, it 
I know you're feeling the same. That'S why you're shaking it 
But you try to deny you play! Fly 
I know you, girls like it as much as I so I 
Have to think of another line to retaliate 
Talking about I like honey on my pancakes 
You. Don'T hear me, though: 
I guess you don't care 
Acting like it's nothing across your mind, but looky here, 
 
Why not give it to me 
 
If, not me! Kick it to my man V 
See, when it's feeling good you maybe don't even thank me. 
I'Ve been a naughty naughty boy, just spank me 
I, like it fat when I'm hitting it from the back 
And. Now it's on your brain, you, bad pussycat, 
, 
Ee, ya, ya, ya, ooh, ya, 
Ee, ya, ya, ee, ya, ya, 
Ee, ya, ya, ya, ooh, ya, 
Ee, ya, ya, ee, ya, ya, 
You got sex on the brain; 
 
It's like ring around the rosey 
Mother, never told Me that I'd think of things like this 
It's sexual, edible intellectual 
Twist, your body like pretzel, 
The, afro civilians, then aphrodisiacs 
Wish to kick game. Even though see me pack 
Yes Lord word to bond the Swann is the don 
Come down yeah 
Free your mind and your booty will follow 
It's, so hot it'll make you lose your marbles 
Jump your bones, like hopscotch 
Move, your hind parts, 
Will, the glow, sho' nuff. I'M the mascot 
Trust in the funk deep enough to crack plastic 
Just. Imagine just imagine 
Cake full of panties booty on the griddle 
Looking, so delicious as I butter her biscuits, 
 
Ayo sex in the 90's ayo. Do the right thing: 
If she's got ta. Have it protect your ting, a ling, a ling, 
The lust the lust it burns like fire, 
Burning eternal of my infernal of desire, 
She walks out with a gap, and it wasn't between her teeth. 
See baby read my mind and she couldn't believe that, ah 
Yeah and ya don't stop 
It's like that with the coochie pop 
 
Check it out. Your name is Mistafiss 
And. His name is Rosta Swann 
And, his name is Ding Ding 
His name is Digge. Dom 
He is the manager V. 
I am the super producer V 
I'm chilling with my crew from the Ville 
Sex on the brain kids chill 
 
Oooh, you nasty I'ma, tell my mama 
Oooh, you nasty, I'm tell yo' mama 
It's the Q
