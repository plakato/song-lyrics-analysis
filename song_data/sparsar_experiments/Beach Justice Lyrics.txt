Beach Justice Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


And I will sell myself for something I made out to be.
And I will sell myself for something I wanted out to be.
Cause talking sucks, I know you like it.
It's just made up stuff beneath the ice cellar.
We'll never know what love is.
All we know is that love is.

When you're really that happy to see me.
When you're really that happy to see me smile.

When she gets up and I'm still awake.
Please go easy on me, Sunday 2x.
Woa-oa-oah, please go easy on me, Sunday.
Yeah yeah yeah, please go easy on me, Sunday.

And I will sell myself for something I made out to be.
And I will sell myself for something I wanted out to be.
Cause all this talk is kinda boring.
You got too much fun for someone boring.
We'll never know what love is.
All we know is that love is.

When she gets up and I'm still awake.
Please go easy on me, Sunday.
