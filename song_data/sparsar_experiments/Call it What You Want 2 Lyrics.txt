Call it What You Want 2 Lyrics
by 415.

D-Loc.
Once again D-Loc is in the mix and.
I'm droppin dope like a muthafuckin kingpin.
Try to step and yep, you get taxed.
Cause the 5ft. 7 big mack is back.
Bitches just scream when I'm doin my thing.
Niggas fear for their life when I grab a mic.
Cause yo, I don't perpetrate, I drop knowledge.
Straight from the school of hard knocks, got it?
D-Loc is from the muthafuckin streets.
Home of the homicide - Oakland, Cali.
A city that's ran by the coke nuts.
So from the heart we'd like to say: fuck a drug bust.
You ask why and my reply.
Is niggas from the streets either do or die.
Just a little somethin that I'm givin to you.
I didn't even name it, so look, call it what you want to.

Richie Rich.
Mackin the mic once again is the Dubble.
The 24 track is mines, you're in trouble.
'90 - damn, another decade.
Well, I guess it's my turn to get paid.
Servin it well, muthafucka, I ain't trippin.
The kid from the hill once again does lippin.
Dubble-R, the man from the Oaktown.
Once again to the mic with a hoedown.
Cali, bitch, I'm straight doin it.
Muthafuckas wanna play close and try to ruin it.
But naw, I ain't really with that.
I ain't no joke, so don't provoke me to serve it.
With an attitude straight supreme.
I gives a fuck, 415 is a scheme.
And I did that, in other words created it.
Pumped it, and the suckers, they hated it.
But the macks and the gangsters loved it.
That's why I pushed and damn sho' shoved it.
Fuckin with the 415 and we'll haunt you.
So call it what you want to.

D-Loc.
Call it what you want, and if you don't you better drop.
D-Loc and Richie Rich is finna pop.
Straight to the t-o-p, it's the L-o-c.
And Dubble-R, my muthafuckin homie.
Doin what we do best, snappin necks like villains.
Just makin a killin.
Any muthafucka wanna run up or step up.
Press your luck and catch a hot one.
This is how it's done where I come from.
To have a business you got to be ruthless.
Just like the guys in the 415.
Who gives a fuck about takin a life?
From my point of view it's a murder or a jack move.
But let's do it like this: call it what you want to.

Richie Rich.
Profile: sweat pants and Nikes.
Light shit in case I have to strike.
On a muthafuckin policeman tryin to jack me.
For throwin the dice I hit twice when he tack me.
Oops, caught me slippin I'm up and I'm out.
I had to bank on it, straight to the mouth.
Comin fuckin with my money while I'm havin some fun.
Stupid-ass punk, he shoulda pulled a gun.
But now it's over with, I'm on my way to the Deuce.
To kick it with the fellas with the gin and juice.
Straight hustlin and immediately clockin.
Hoes  and started jockin.
Just like Loc said, who gives a fuck.
415 in your face, you better duck.
Cause Loc's got my back and I know that he's packin.
415 with the nine straight jackin.
We couldn't make a name, this is all that we could come to.
Haha, call it what you want to.
