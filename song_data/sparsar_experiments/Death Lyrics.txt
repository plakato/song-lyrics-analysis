Death Lyrics
by Sworn In.

I said hell's not a place you find beneath the ground.
Not a place you can see.
Not a place you'll be found.
Hell's not a place that you go when you're dead.
Hell's inside your fucking head.
Dragged to hell.
Be quiet don't tell.
I've made a deal to get out of my head.
Trade my sanity for sleep.
And trust me it's cheap.
I'll let my body rot to the core.
Nevermore, Nevermore.
And in the end I don't give a damn.
It was all part of the plan.
I've lost it all and I still can't sleep.
I can't feel, can't see and oh fuck I can't think.
Maybe this is what I wanted.
I've lost it all and I still can't sleep.
I can't feel, can't see and oh fuck I can't think.
Maybe this is what I wanted.
Fuck....
I've lost it all and I still can't sleep.
I can't feel, can't see and oh fuck I can't think.
Maybe this is what I wanted....
I'm finally here in hell but I'm only a guest.
