Dirty Lungs Lyrics
by Wooh Da Kid.


Lotta' smoke, dirty lungs.
I swear I smoked a lot, I need 'bout thirty lungs.
Word around town I'm worth 'bout thirty tons.
Thirty youngin's on the block, that's 'bout thirty guns.

My little homie hit a lick, for 'bout thirty pounds.
His little sister, baby daddy, he just laid 'em down.
He robbed 'em with a mess like he ain't no his voice.
He like I don't give a fuck, I ain't have a choice.
Thirty youngin's 'round with him, they don't play around.
Thirty niggas with extendo's that hold thirty rounds.
Lotta' smoke, dirty lungs.
Don't get your ass smoked from this dirty gun.

It's a party going on with the Squad nigga.
B.S.M., Wooh Da Kid, party hard nigga.
You know Wooh Da don't play that, shooter's I'll K that.
Chopstick party, you know we will A.K. that.
Two two three will make him lay back.
Close the curtains on your life, like a Maybach.
Why I'm getting zooted with my niggas, hella dirty lungs.
R.I.P. Slim D, I got us, put that on my son's.

Fist up, thugging like the Panthers in the eightie's.
Wooh Da I'm a hippy, I be smoking with your lady.
Dirty lungs, dirty girl, she got dirty ways.
He ain't seen her in a month, that's 'bout thirty days.
Thirtie's the new twenty, then I'm in my teens.
Your little sister nineteen, then I'm in her jeans.
She got dirty lungs, all she do is smoke.
Swimming laps in that pussy, think I need a boat.
