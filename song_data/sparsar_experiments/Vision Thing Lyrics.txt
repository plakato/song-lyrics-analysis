Vision Thing Lyrics
by Sweet Noise.

Twenty-five whores in the room next door.
Twenty-five floors and i need more.
I'm looking for the can in the candy store.
Two thousand hamburg four.
And colours i ain't seen before.

It's a small world and it smells funny.
I'd buy another if it wasn't for the money.
Take back what i paid.
For another motherfucker in a motorcade.

In a long black car.
With the prettiest shit.
From Panama.
When the sirens wail.
And the lights flash blue.
My vision thing come.
Slamming through.

It's a small world and it smells bad.
I'd buy another if i had.
Take back what i paid.
For another motherfucker in a motorcade.

Slamming through.
Slamming through.

What do wee need to make our world come alive?
What does it take to make us sing sing...?
While we're waiting for the next one to arrive?
One million points of light.
One billion dollar vision thing.

Another black hole in the killing zone.
A little more mad in the methedrome.
One blinding flash of sense.
Just like the president's.
Well, i don't mind.
Out of my mind.
Blizzard king.
Bring it on home.

It's a small world and it smells bad.
I'd buy another if i had.
Take back what i paid.
For another motherfucker in a motorcade.

Slamming through.
It is vision thing.

Twenty-five whores in the room next door.
I can't find any more.
Twenty-five floors and i need more.
Sometimes I wanna fuck this all.

Vision thing.
Blizzard king.
