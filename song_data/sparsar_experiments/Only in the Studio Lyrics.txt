Only in the Studio Lyrics
by X-Raided  (a.k.a. Nefarious).


Fat niggas puttin shit up in the game.
Livin off the fame of the Garden Blocc name.
But never did dirt or put in no work.
They be rappin like they g's.
Talkin bout maccin bitches and slangin ki's.
But please you a ho.
No need to play the role like you ain't kowin that.
Go look in the mirror, you won't see no gangsta starin bacc.
Based on that fact I'm let it be known.
Gotta tell the homies what really goes on nigga.

You don't even know how to load a nine.
You seen your homie do some dirt and went and wrote a rhyme.
But how you talkin bout bein a killa and never made a niggas brain hang.
You sayin you a loc but never gang banged.
Nigga you ought to win an Oscar.
The Best Actor of the Year you ain't no mutha fuccin mobsta.
You faker than Cubic Zarconia.
Givin a bad reputation to niggas in Killafornia.
We puttin bustas in hearses.
Why you marks be bombin on base heads and snatchin bitches purses.
That punk shit, but nigga you think you so a hard.
That's why thay X-Raided loc be pullin ho calls.

You a gang bangin nigga.
Hustla, mutha fuccin psycho, loco, but only in the studio.
Rappin like you real.
Talkin bout how you kill niggas.
Let the truth be told, it's only in the studio.
Gang bangin nigga.
Hustla, mutha fuccin psycho, loco, only in the studio.
Rappin like you real.
Talkin bout how you kill niggas.
Let the truth be told, only in the studio.

I grab cash plus guns.
Roll with old you gets done for the buns.
And we four for the door.
It's time for roll.
And you done crossed the wrong line.
And I couldn't forgive myself.
For tellin your ass one more time.
Now grab your ski and be on the grind.
On a paper chase.
Lace up your boots.
And shoot for the skrill from the gate.
And you betta make hate.
Cuz it ain't no time or minor race.
I ride with realas and killas from day one and stay no face.
Murder ones, protect identities.
And murder twos, to kill off all these studio g's.
Everybody claimin to be a gangsta in the boot.
When it's time to ride they ducc and hide these niggas scared to shoot.
Ain't never seen you on the streets.
And you don't want to fucc with us cuz we real mutha fuccin P-C's.
Blacc Market soldiers takin over, still slangin yola.
We realas up in this shit nigga somebody should of told ya.

Yeah nigga....
Yeah Doc....
What, what, you neva had me though.
Creased blue kakies with blue laces in them blue kiccs.
You never strolled the blocc with them true crips.
Niggas like you round the locs is through.
Bitch nigga swallow a dicc, that's why you getting ran through.
Straight trippin you could claim my blocc.
You never hanged with the crips and never rang no Gloccs.
Mo like a succa, but figure now a nigga would know.
When you slip around and through settrip, it's like walkin death row.
Now you see but you seen to late.
Mutha fucca, you slit like a clit cuz your ass is fake.

You can't crip walk then don't let your gat talk.

I never seen you on the spot.
Never seen you with a Glocc.
That's how real gangstas roll.
Dippin old schools and rags.
Holiday and X-Raided loc.
