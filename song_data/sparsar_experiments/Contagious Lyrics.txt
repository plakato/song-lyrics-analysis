Contagious Lyrics
by Ruse.

The hardest part of giving up.
Is not knowing when you're done.
I used to think I was tough enough.
To last forever, to call your bluff.

So how do you know when you're done.
When the battle at hand just can't be won.

This hurt is contagious.
And only time will save us.
Never alone.
I can't give you all away.
Never alone.
What will it take to make you stay.
Stay, stay.

It's the damaged start I have to stop.
All the time it took to find out who we are.
My guilt assured for my part.
I bear forever I can't hide this scar.

So how do you know when it's done.
When the battle at hand just can't be won.

This hurt is contagious.
And only time will save us.
Never alone.
I can't give you all away.
Never alone.
What will it take to make you stay.
Stay, stay.

You took the time to write me off.
You held me close you made me soft.
Now I am falling apart.
I blurred the line and you took it all.
A dying sign, there's nothing left at all.

This hurt is contagious.
This hurt is contagious.

This hurt is contagious.

And only time will save us.

Never alone.
I can't give you all away.
Never alone.
What will it take to make you stay.
