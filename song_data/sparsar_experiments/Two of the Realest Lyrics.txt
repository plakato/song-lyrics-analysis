And a one and a two and a three nobody 
Who fuckin' with us in this motherfucker. Nobody 
We young and focused determined and thick 
We, got our mind right money right. We running this bitch 
Yung ro, nobody think about don't do it. 
This is not just music cause, look theres, nothing to it. 
How. I talk about my structure, how I punish motherfuckers 
Punchin' lines without no knuckles cock back, blucka, blucka 
Gyeah and I'm just getting started, but I'm struggling the hardest 
So, I'm hustling the hardest. 
You think I won't, but I can and would 
Fuck a beat mac say I can rap and make the wind sound good 
Now. Let me explain why I'm the hardest dog 
I, never sleep, sometimes but hardly naw- 
Now. Let me explain why I'm the hardest dog 
I! Never sleep sometimes, but hardly naw- 
Now. Let me explain why I'm the hardest dog 
I, never sleep, sometimes, but hardly naw 
And. I don't waste. No time chilling with shawty gaw 
I go get this cash and you go party girl, 
I'm tryna rock some re-runs of marty, mob 
But boys playing games with me. Oh lawdy, lord 
Marcus pop that daddy and just record it dog 
Now. I'M seeing why Jigga laugh nigga hawdy haw 
Other teams are nice, but nigga are's is hard, 
We spit it all from pain, street shit to cars and brauds 
Pausin', star homie focus just listen, 
Now, I'm about to teach and define Paid In Full edition, 
Two, plus One And later on another one 
Paul Wall, Koopa, Fifty and your's, truly yung, yung, 
Dumb, dumb boy, I'm in it to prove 
I race, the clock and pass it up every minute. It move 
I'm that young nobody with a venomous crew 
Get the mic hot, make C, put a bent in the booth, 
Me and Twin, get high and show you what menaces do 
Then. You got Koopa to deal with when we finished with you. 
Lil E put ten in a dude, he put ten and he cool 
He, a fag, a coward, a man, who's, feminin, ooh 
And, any of them dudes that give me the clues 
They fixing to move. I merk'em on site now give me a coo 
I'm, skinny and rude with a semi or two 
With plenty of mood- swings, and I pity the fool 
Look, I'm on remy and goose. The gin and the juice 
Henny and woo stressed on the edge not friendly or cool 
Slow daddy. We finished with you. 
Cocky koopa invest flip cash and spending it too 
We got them swangers and vogues, but we spinning them too. 
The paint change, color four times shine and blending the tool. 
Lin is my new protege on the nobody roster 
We the hottest niggas out and got a lot to offer. 
You got plex, you better think boy and pipe pipe dine 
Fuck with Ro. I play it cool and wipe boys dine 
Won't hesitate to squeeze the hammer .
 I pack and bake the powder like arm and hammer 
I'm on this bammer weed in my home in Atlanta, 
Papperazzis and fast flashing when we on the camera 
But on the channel. True, you won't ever see me: 
I reup remain focused cut throat and flee. 
I got ta payroll rotation. Keep me mob style, protected 
I got workers watching workers, mob style, connected 
Me and Twin face to face mob style. Reflected 
I got a lot of love for niggas, mob style in Texas, 
Yung Ro. Nobody, you still ain't, convinced, 
My arms folded, hands shaking and my eyes is squinched 
Gyeah. You know who running the game 
Paid In Full them waterboys. Nobody and Color Change. 
 
Slim Thug 
Boss, Hogg, Outlawz 
I, represent the Boss, Hogg Outlaw gang 
We, one of the rawest clicks that ever came in the game. 
Besides, the fame me and my boys on these streets 
Best believe the truth spoke when we on these beats 
All that balling and ice. I really love that life. 
When people see the boss, they say it must be. Nice 
To have a house that price drive a car that price 
I got four or five dimes. What I want with a wife 
I done seen enough green to pay for both our dreams, 
And done so much dirt. I can't afford to be clean. 
I been all around the world lived fantasies with girls 
Got everything I wanted, including diamonds and pearls 
It's kind of scary, make a nigga wonder: what's next 
Is it normal for one kid to be so blessed 
I'm impressed by what the lord gave me 
And. I'M thankful because the lord saved me 
And. He made me the man I am 
So. Maybe that's why I am what I am 
So, why you other cats trying to take my position? 
It'S out of ya hands. Man keep on wishing 
Ask around what the click running. The north is 
Ask around who the mother fucking big boss is 
It's like this, if ya, hot ya, hot 
But. On the other hand, if ya, not ya, not 
Nigga,
