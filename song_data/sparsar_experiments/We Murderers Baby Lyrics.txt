We Murderers Baby Lyrics
by Vita.


Yo.
Da Murderers.
I.N.C..
Vita, Ja Rule.

I be running and gunning them down.
Leave me or love me now.
Anywhere, anyhow.
You and I together, and we blast forever.
{2x}.

Ja's the dream and nigga's wake up and sweats its about.
Horse head in your bed, nigga.
Gun your mouth.
Potty it out.
Wrong nigga.
Spit one more thang and have your hood pouring out liqour.
Cause my niggas run through lesbians.
Niggas, that act like brawds.
Feel the strip and thus be gone.
Hold up, nigga that done spread up.
You might wanna keep in touch with the murderers.
Cause we, the murderers I.N.C.
Is above yall niggas, it's the lord in me.
And we can never be at a love's lost.
But you, showed me love ain't boss.
Feel the force.
This young horse.
Known as rule.
Gave more paper to jigga for my ewls.
And lord knows ain't no pussy going to stop my flow.
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door.

You that motherfucking bitch, Vita nigga.
You want me to ryde you nigga.
Clap up and hide you nigga.
Been beside my niggas for this long.
I'm keeping my head right and tight and doe long.
I can go on, about shit I've been through.
Transponed, keys are in too.
Shit I got issues.
If I pop a bitch.
Then she probably a snitch.
L-A-V-I-T-A-A-A-K-A Taday Vallet shit.
When my niggas from my bitches.
Sold drugs from niggas to the murderes.
I'm the bitch, sometimes I even spit on chicks.
Cause in the clubs, I sip Crys', and I piss the shit, baby.
I know your brawds been feeling me, lately, now livin and lay.
Cause I touch them with gun blades, dark is us.
Any light, shine, we bust.
Vita, Gotti and Rule, we make up the murderers.

The reasons why I pop between the lie.
Be the same reasons I clap off the nines.
Roll up on bronx, like, who da hot bitch.
And stock, with some sweats, humpin out on sixth.

That's it, go head baby, floss out bitches.
But me, I'm continue to clap niggas.
Strike and heavy hitters that, play the field, reveal.
Pull that weapon and re-keep the seal.

It's murder to the end.
Only Jesus Christ made us a strong sacrifice.
These niggas I die for, lies to the fed form.
Set out these bitch niggas, I pick them in bad form.

Baby, I'm long gone, but I'm loyal.
For the love that you show your bitches.
And spread to your thugs.
And they tongue kiss slugs.
When the fucking wit us.
You crazy, that's why.
