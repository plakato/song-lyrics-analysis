Pink Lemonade Lyrics
by The Wombats.


Another magical Friday night.
I think I'll sit this one at home.
Unusual for me I know.
But please go ahead.
I don't wanna be the blinking rabbit to.
Your wildebeest.
The jaded lover to his sex machine.
You should go ahead.

And please give those recycled house tracks my warmest regards.
And lock the door if you're home before the sun, oh.

Pink, pink lemonade.
And does he kiss you, till your lips explode?
Pink, pink lemonade.
And does he take you places I can't afford to go?
Pink lemonade you know I know behind that sugar there's only lies, lies,.
lies, lies.

The Wombats.
Another magical Friday night.
I wonder what state you're in.
In the powder or in the gin?
This one's ending bad.

So please give those recycled house tracks my warmest regards.
And if you bring him home can you use the spare bedroom? Ohhh.

Pink, pink lemonade.
And does he kiss you, till your lips explode?
Pink, pink lemonade.
And does he take you places I can't afford to go?
Pink lemonade you know I know behind that sugar there's only lies, lies,.
lies, lies.

Breakdown: The Wombats.
And that's alright and that's okay.
If i can write this song I can play that game.
It's all good with me if I know it's all good with you.
Cause getting lost in the middle of the in-between.
Is only half as frightening as it first may seem.
So do what ever you must and I'll do whatever it must take.

Pink lemonade.
Pink lemonade.
Pink lemonade.
Pink lemonade.
