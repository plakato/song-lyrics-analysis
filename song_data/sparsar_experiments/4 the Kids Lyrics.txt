4 the Kids Lyrics
by Unknown Prophets.

Big Jess talking.
Yeah, this one right here...this for the kids...this is for all kids....
City kids, suburban kids, rich kids, poor kids, messy kids, clean kids.
It don't matter; man the kids is our future, people need to start waking up....
And realize what's really going on.
Cause everything ain't all good, it's really not.
So we just gonna do this for the kids right now.
And dedicate this to ya'll - Unknown Prophets style baby.

Mad Sun.
To all the shorties who decided their favorite emcee's rhymes.
And girls playin double doutch in the summer time.
I'm lookin at your childhood.
Reminicing on mine.
Yo it's funny how things can change throughout time.
Now your online sendin out e-m's to your friends.
Little Cats rockin today's latest trends.
In the schoolyard, tradin your pokemon cards.
Everyone tryin to cop the ol' charizard.
Promos and holographics.
Dreamcast, videogames with the illest graphics.
Basketball practice.
Your Allison's the future Jordan's.
Saturday's wakin up to catch cartoons in the mornings.
Yo I know it's boring, sometimes your sittin in class.
Other days your straight clowin makin everyone laugh.
Passin notes to that girl that's got a crush on you.
Your like, Yo girl, I like ya too..
For all the kids in the Burbs.
And all the kids in the City.
Hangin with your crew.
Actin mad silly.
Chase all your dreams till you make them reality.
Respect yourself, your peers and your family.
For all the kids strugglin'.
Keep your head up.
Brighter days are ahead.
The rain will soon let up.
And when your fed up, ready to call it quits.
Remember we all go through rough times.
Even the Prophets.
So this if for them kids at New Vision School, Bottnem Park yo in Harlem too.
To all the little rascals across the Map.
Peace from the Prophets.
No matter where you at.

This is for them kids who lact respect.
And this is for them kids with the well paid checks.
This if for them kids who get good grades.
And this if for them kids just tryin to get paid.
This if for them kids who stay in school.
And this is for them kids who wanna act da fool.
This is for all kids, whether good or bad, big or small, we still got love.
For ya'll.

Big Jess.
I see some of the kids on my bus.
They probed to cuss.
It's like they headed straight to jail to be thrown in cuffs.
Parents dont take the time to monitor their kids music.
When most of the lyircs are, explicitly abusive.
Your Son's got dirty clothes.
Why you sittin on low pros.
Sendin him to school with ragidy hair.
That's a no-no.
They need to be playin with yo-yo's instead of bullets.
Cause kids these days ain't got enough sense not to pull it.
They hear it on cd's, they see it on TV.
In doesn't go in one year and out the other believe me.
You need to read to your kids and be with your kids, you need to listen to.
Your kids and feed your kids.
You need to love your kids and provide for your kids.
You need to make them know you would die for your kids.
Yo, I feel that kids look up to us as role-models.
So we gotta give them somethin positive to follow.
So this is for the kids runnin in the streets at night.
And for those skippin class when they know it ain't right.
There's too much bad hype bout black and white.
And kids gotta go through life with negative stereotypes.
All white kids ain't devils.
All black kids ain't thugs.
All white kids aren't in the colt.
All black kids don't sell drugs.
Some do but that's just the way things are.
But you can make a difference wheter near or far.
From Tuttle to Marseat.
From Sheridan to Kenwood.
From the kids on Lowry, all the way down to Glenwood.
From my hood, to your hood, to people everywhere.
The Prophets here to show you we care.
Ya heard me.
