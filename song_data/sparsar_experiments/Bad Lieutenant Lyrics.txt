Bad Lieutenant Lyrics
by Queen Kwong.


I had a dream as a child.
A reoccurring dream.

And like wildfire it spread.
Throughout every cell, throughout every stem.
Every dead end within my body.
And as a child, well, I could encourage myself.
Encourage myself to scream.
It was too late, the die had been cast.

I spent some time thinking that I came around.
But I still could trace the shape of his ugly mouth.
He pulled all my teeth to mark me with his name.
Now every night is the same.

Maybe I'm young.
Or born a whore.
How could I love what I'm dying for?

He took my neck but I willingly tied the noose.
My hands are tied and my legs are bruised.
Blood rust and barely awake on the floor.
And then I died for it once more.
