Slob Lyrics
by SwitchMIX.


No shoes, no shirt, but I'll still serve ya.
Spit sick shit nigga, get your crew dirted or hurted.
In the morgue, laying up against a.
board while your wife is in my room.
getting split by my sword.
Bam, boom, splat, kapow. Go and eat.
your dog chow. Now plow brown cow.
, bitch how you like me now.
?
I'm a motherfucking villain.
Throwing chitlins at children.
Now i'm killing, hitting women. While.
i'm sipping on some gin &amp; whiskey.
Miss me, kiss me, diss me, but don't motherfucking list me.
I'm a hitman, don't get hit man..
Killing wrestlers while they get slammed.
Like Jake the Snake, I'll get a rake.
and fuck your bitch like jailbait.
Get it mate? It's rape. Niggerish like.
stalemates.
Niggerish like black cards and motherfucking black cars.
Green cash, white ass. Fuck up and you get smashed.
Blast off, astronaut.
But nigga, I laugh a lot.
Super clown with superfrown.
Pedophilic superland.
Chords in Massive. Lords in baskets.
. Pure-minding willing masses.
, I'm your cult leader. Perky.
like a cheerleader.
Women beater. Drink the ether.
. Go and kill your fucking teachers.

Mistake. Risk take-r, like a red snake.
Camouflage.
Sam &amp; Son.
Splinter Cell.
The chosen one.
Neo, geo, onomatopoe-o.
Bitch you need our lingo.
Cat Squad.
Mack squad.
Fuck a dog.
Like a slob.
I must be in the forest 'cuz I think that i'm shitting lost.
