Monroe Lyrics
by Annie Mell Monroe.


It's my life I make way to the sky, fly away with visions, money, music, you.
and I.
I don't care for the fame, write a record fade away, a narcissist they say,.
it's just another day.

Classic with the beat you must know I'm an assassin, rode up of the street.
first ave right in Manhattan.
But made it far worked hard I said it in my album, people never believed me.
now I have something to laugh at.
Come down to basics I take it all I am hungry for a million dollar house a.
Lamborghini, marble floors.
I never got why people say their life is such a chore, I contemplate a better.
future watch my ego wash ashore.

Under a thousand tons of pressure, MDMA for the pleasure, hate on me cause.
that's assessment like a fucking test.
It's called life though, bread and cheese and wine hun, stacks don't.
discriminate kill every rapper who gets in my way.
Anybody today claims that whatever the fuck say is called rap but niggas need.
a map and niggas need some new bars.
Don't be mad saltines with french caviar, maybe I look rich today but look at.
where I'm going at.

Another week, different year, look at me I made it here, fuck the swag shit.
give you simple image you endear.
Different sound on the stage,.
ripped the floor out killed the page.
Taking over the game now, plenty of weed and cocaine now, my life is all fun.
and games.
How the fuck do you say I ain't proud man, I got it, this new shit I'm all.
about it, I flaunt it.
Family in this business how we rap is an art don't doubt it and say what you.
want don't miss this opportunity, don't fall out bitch.
