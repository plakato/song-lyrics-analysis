Who You Lyrics
by Xeezy.


Who you? Who you?
Ni99a who you?
I call these ni99as Claire....
Why?
Cause I see right through you.
These ni99as call me King Sire.
Yeah Shaka Zulu.
These ni99as know I'm bout mine,they pay me like a Susu.
QQ,'Wine and do de one drop'pew pew.
Who knew,that Xeezy do it wet like Dew do.

Dummer nig cah rep in public,got em hatey with my voodoo.
UGH! Be silent be still.
UGH! Be violent,we ill.
We do this shit at will.
Fresh Prince of Bell Air.
Our girls look like Hil.
&amp; we bald like Uncle Phil.
...Ashley,the banks,is where we dwell.
Step in ah de room,per fume,can you smell?
Don't know if you can tell?
They call me Papa Shell.
All these blues in my pocket,I deserve a Nobel.

That's just how I do it when I do it.
Trini ni99as foolish.
Ain't no way these ni99as knew us.
Huh?

Yeah,I'm just being me.
&amp; I can only be the man mama made me out to be.
Can't you see,who I am,I'm a man,with a plan.
Who I was no longer,matters in the presents where I stand.

............Now nod your head if you feeling that.
&amp; if you think this Wack.
Then stop playing my track.
It's as simple as facts.
It's as simple as taxes.
But if you feeling me,then pump your volume to the max.
Wait.....lemme take em back.
To the days when we had suffering.
To the days when we had nothing.
Used to go to bed straight buggin.
Literally,stray bugging.
Mosquitoes,no cox-set.
Bed with no cover-let.
Now we got twin bedroom mattress set.
With twins rocking corsets.
Our paths inter course,no sex.
Now we got these ni99as vex.
Cause our money long like giraffe's necks.
Damn,what do you expect.
Why you think they call me X.
Cause that's what I am to your girl.
That's what I am in Math.
Yeah I'm a treasure chest.
Yes,now watch a maga ni99a flex.
&amp; I hate to pop your bubble.
But all that muscles is a waste of flesh.
But don't stress,just take a couple breathes.
&amp; if you insist on keeping my name inside your mouth,then make sure that.
it's fresh.
