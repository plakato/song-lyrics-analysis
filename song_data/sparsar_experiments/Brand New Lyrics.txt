Brand New Lyrics

Baby girl.
I see myself with you.
Baby girl.
You make me feel brand new.

And when the lights go down.
And that liquor pours up.
And less is no.
That the truth comes out.
And you can't control your anger.
With your Colombian mouth.

Baby girl.
I see myself with you.
Baby girl.
You make me feel brand new.

I'll follow you into the dark.
And I'll ride your wave.
Until it crashes on me.
Drunk of you.
And high off floatin'.
In this Dead Sea.

Baby girl.
I see myself with you.
Baby girl.
You make me feel brand new.

Baby, tell me are you down.
For the realist mutha' fukka' alive.
For the realist mutha' fukka' alive.
For the realist mutha' fukka' alive.
