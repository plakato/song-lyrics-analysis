Ghost In My Life Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Ghost In My Life.

Through those gates no turning 'round.
Lovers lost and new ones found.
If stars should guide your life from mine.
Remember me through better times.

And I want you to know, that I need you to stay.
Would you try to let go, if I stood in the way.
And I need you to see now, there's no where to hide.
If tonight you should leave as the ghost in my life.

Moving in through empty rooms.
The times that bend the world to you.
And I know you think I'm less at fault.
But if I sink or swim I won't give up, I won't give up.

And I want you to know, that I need you to stay.
Would you try to let go, if I stood in the way.
And I need you to see, now there's no where to hide.
If tonight you should leave as the ghost in my life.
As the ghost in my life.

What do you think about that.
Ooh yeah.

And I need you to see now there's no where to hide.
If tonight you should leave as the ghost in my life.
