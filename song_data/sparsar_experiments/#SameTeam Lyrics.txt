#SameTeam Lyrics
by Swoope.


What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king.
It's still 116 bruh.
Oh Lord! Working for the same team.
I think I need a adlib from Diddy!
Cause I'ma take that each and every city.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause I'ma take that to each and every city, homie I'ma....

Lecrae sell a million records.
And my name don't get mentioned in the review.
It don't matter, get the W.
Cause even players on the bench get rings too.
Way deep is what the crew is.
On the same team, all runnin' the same play.
So you need to check your motives if you're doin' this.
If you was mad Andy sold 28k.
Takin' away from the mission.
All this division don't add up.
It all equals dissension.
You ask me that's bad math, bruh.
So yeah, I'm on Collision, but really I am indifferent.
If you 116 and independent.
No, you king livin', junkie dream itchin'.
Humble coffee bean sippin'.
Long as the mission and the team don't seem different.

Take that, take that.
Core so tight, can't break that, break that.
Might find me and the squad, cliqued up in yo' city.
Preachin' truth, yeah, we show em' where the faith at.
Man, what the deal is? We show where the real is.
Am I brother's keeper?
We pass around that good-good, but I ain't talkin' reefer.
And we on, and we ain't never goin' off.
We gon' do it like this till we gone.
Tell em' young boy, looka here.
Folk, you gotta man up.
Trap hard when you pressin' in the zone.
And I ain't talkin' kitchen.
And we pitchin' and we givin' you the mission.
That He gave us when He put us on.
This real life boy, more than a song.
Live here like kings till he call us home.
Hol' up.

What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king.
It's still 116 bruh.
Oh Lord, workin' for the same team.
I think I need a adlib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city, homie I'ma.

Unashamed of the name.
Run it back I stay the same.
Recognize united game man.
Cause I can remind tell em I ain't quittin' bro.
Man ain't what I'm livin' for.
Where they go, that's where I go, that's how it go like every time.
Take it to the places where they say this isn't for you.
But then maybe they complacent.
Stay inside the fortress where it's safest.
Cause outside these walls they say it's really dangerous.
Homie I believe 'em.
That's why I'm out here ridin' for the people.
Tell 'em where I be at when they need me.
You ain't gotta be me.
Or do something different tryna beat me.
You sayin', it's insane to run my lane like Usain.
So you sling around my name through the mud.
But you playin' all these games.
The truth man everybody in their body is invited.
Cause they follow where you walkin'.
Or talkin' how you talkin'.
I ain't runnin' from this thing cause this thing ain't for the runnin'.
Man I call it like I see it, referee it.
All things to all men, I'm tryna be it.
If I'm 1-1-6 then that mean I'm on mission.
And He orders every lil' step, Bobby Brown, New Edition.
But who woulda thought where I went woulda cause division.
How coulda Humble Beast tryna reach.
Where they be bring the beats.
Honestly could receive all this grief and cause a collision, my God.
No, for real, my God.
Give me clear sight just to live how you are.
God knows I want that for sure.
Everything whole life hope he give it to me.
Please know where you be isn't where he has me, has me.
But it's still same team, same team!

What I'm finna quit for?
You see me livin' like a king.
It's still 116, bruh.
Oh Lord, workin' for the same team.
I think I need a adlib from Diddy!
Cause I'ma take that each and every city.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause I'ma take that to each and every city, homie I'ma....

Humble as a mumble in the jungles of shouts and screams.
Diggin' tunnels under a stampede, beast!
Okay-kay keep prayin' for the grace.
We stay cold but never freeze.
Like water at four-four blap-blap degrees fahrenheit.
Where was I, dare if I share a terabyte, we don't care if you verified.

Your lil' branch is just a fraction in the middle of a grain of sand.
Or the hand of a master crafter of sand castles with the passion.
Imagine, decapitatin' dragons.
We are just a vapor on paper on another vapor of a microcosm.
Of a remnant of minions runnin' like Kenyans like Obama.
In repentance to the Father.
Better warn the town the beast is loose.
And you on the same team if the dreams from the same king.
If it floats from the same stream.
If it don't then it's gangrene.

Give a junkie a inch, he take it a mile.
Give a junkie a dream, he takin' 'em out.
With the power of a catalyst cattlin' sheep through the wild.
I hear 'em wolfin' but the Lion King is keepin' 'em down, heh.

I love to think the victory is keepin' the smile.
In the face of devious, mischievous dundee crocodiles.
We done playin' with you dummies, domination is now!
It's 'bout a hundred hooligans.
All saved, all serious.
Hootie-who want it with the crusade militia men?
Valid with the villages, get down or lay down.
See nor hear nor speak no evil, that's how we play now.
Our Father come down from heaven, that's how we pray now.
Son of God, Son of man.
Rah-rah, Yahweh now.
Anyway you wanna do it, we could do it.
Who the truest of the tribe?
Swoope, you ain't ever lie, we on the same team.

What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king.
It's still 116 bruh.
Oh Lord! Working for the same team.
I think I need a adlib from Diddy!
Cause I'ma take that each and every city.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
Homie, I'ma take that, take that.
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause I'ma take that to each and every city, homie I'ma....
