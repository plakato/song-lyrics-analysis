Fax Me Lyrics
by Andrew E..

Eh yo, what 
This is Andrew E. one time again for your mind 
But this time I might take it slow and low 
So. Here we go 
It's about a girl na mahilig mag-fax 
I mean you know, as in fax. Machine 
And goes a little something like this. 
It was a Friday night, I'm feeling alright 
I signed with Sony future looked bright. 
Mag-Ga-Gabi na ako'y nasa labas pa 
Nag-dinner ako, well kasi gutom na 
Time to celebrate the world is mine. 
Perfect timing to wine and dine 
I went to Malate derecho Outback 
Australian beef time to niak 
Sat down the table. Nanood ng, cable, 
I ordered Spumati kasi, I'm stable, 
Willing and able I'm still single 
Looking for a girl na makaka-mingle 
Nang may dumating anak ng pating 
Sa aking harapan ,'sang, balikbayan 
Andrew, E. right 
Fresh from the flesh. That'S me 
Here's. My number fax me 
 
Fax me in the morning 
Then just walk away: 
We will fax tomorrow 
Coz, we fax yesterday, yeah ..., hey 
Ah, ..., ah ... 
So, finax, ko siya 
Excited ang Andrew 
Finax, din niya ako, not one, not two 
Pero ten times. What else can I say: 
Finax niya ako shit all damn day: 
At habang fina-fax, ko siya 
Kinakausap, ko siya kinakausap niya ako, 
Tinatanong, niya, ako 
Have. You ever been faxed before 
Yeah, but not like this so fax me, more 
Good, 
Nagfa-fax, kami, nag-e-enjoy, kami, 
Nag-internet, kami, kahit, walang, kape 
Pero may sugar at mayroong, whipped cream, 
Nagfa-fax, kami kahit sa dilim, 
So, fax, fax, ng, fax, baby yeah. That'S it 
Sumisigaw! Every time na makaka-transmit, 
We, fax all day and we fax all night, 
We, fax and it's alright 
 
Fax me in the m
