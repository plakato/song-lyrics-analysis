Cinematic Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


Cinematic how a nigga living.
Moon roof in the ceiling just to hurt their feelings.
Trying to run my money up like a was a sprinter.
I ain't never had enough it's only the beginning.
Cinematic how a nigga living.
Moon roof in the ceiling just to hurt their feelings.
Ya, like a was a sprinter.
This only the beginning.

I used to dream about being famous I'd rather be rich.
Rather when I leave the planet my daughter having some shit.
Rather be in control like Janet her dad and some shit.
Rather leave a mark in the game before the casket get dipped.
Dead for them old ways, these ain't the old days.
You can't control me.
I'm the latest version Quentin, I'm not the old me.
See I remain me, you sold your soul and it got you nowhere.
Oh ya that's right I'mma go there.
Back to that real you ain't heard in so long.
Let my new one get her Marilyn Monroe on, Covergirl glow on.
Baby show them who you are.
Me and you go together so high, so high, so high.

Interlude.
HTAL2 told you it was coming.
Merry Christmas.

Cinematic how a nigga living.
Moon roof in the ceiling just to hurt their feelings.
Trying to run my money up like a was a sprinter.
I ain't never had enough it's only the beginning.
Cinematic how a nigga living.
Moon roof in the ceiling just to hurt their feelings.
Ya, like a was a sprinter.
This only the beginning.

All up in your city like I always been there.
New pretty looking gorgeous in it.
I tried to work a nine to five it just wasn't getting it.
I started working when I quit that bitch.
Now pal I can get that tip.
Maybe someone who what that is.
Y'all selling for the weak shit selling for the hits right back in.
I'm offin' y'all acting.
If we inside your function we brought Jack in.
Half a million glo 1317 glo ya.

Moon roof in the ceiling just to hurt their feelings.
Trying to run my money up like a was a sprinter.
This only the beginning.
I intentionally didn't use auto tune on this shit.
This shit would wave if I did though, we'll just let y'all do the watching.
Hey Thanks A Lot 2.
Yea, Yea, next level you fucks.
