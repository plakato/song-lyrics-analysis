Don't Let Me Sober Up Lyrics
by Yung Simmie.


Fuck that I'm doing me.
Young MC from the CC.
I'm switchin' cars, rockin' jewelry.
Imma pull up you won't know it's me.
The rap game is full of snakes, so I cut the grass, I grab my rake.
Touchin' fade and fell.
I spit fire you in rap hell.
I cuffed the side chick cause she like to kiss and tell.
I heard you very frail.
I keep the hammer, no nails.
I'm counting all this guap that will never stop.
You steam head niggas, we'll get your caddle popped.
Now your time is up.
I'm picking up my watch, pickin' up the Glock.
Bust it til it's hot, see his body drop.
Flee the parking lot, nothing to talk about.
We just walk it out, you get the work and I'm clockin' out.
Semi came to get it poppin' out.
I'm poppin' out like what we talkin' bout.
Is it guap or what? Ain't no stoppin' us.
Pull up in the drop top, let the top drop.
You can see the Bronx with us.
Smoking stanky, you lookin' so disgust.
But you can't smoke with us, so watch me roll that up.
Now you lookin' mad with your shoulders up.
Get your own smoke, get your doja up.
Now you all alone, get your soldier up.
Who got the drank? Somebody pour me up.

Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.

Don't let me sober up.
I'm sippin', I'm rollin' my doja up.
Mary Jane, I'm so in love with her.
Got me two buds and I got me two double cups.
If I'm doin' nothing I'm pourin' up.
Tourin' in your city guess I'm a foreigner.
Bad bitches hittin' my line and I be ignorin' her.
These niggas taking they time and I ain't slowin' up.
Money on my mind, gotta count it when I pick it up.
Comin' for your head, I got goons in the pick up track.
This is not what you lookin' for.
I heard you pourin' 3's, you ain't sippin' 4.
I don't even touch the knob when I hit the door.
Because I roll blunts like a young lord.
My main bitch know I got a million whores.
And she helped me roll my blunts when I stepped in the door.
Don't let me sober up.
Lean with the sprite that's the turn up cup.
Yung Simmie be turnin' up.
I'm takin' your girl cause you borin' her.
I'm blowin' that OG pack.
Sober I never heard of that.
And nah I ain't going back.
Don't let me sober up, pass me the OG pack.

Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
Somebody pour me up.
Don't let me sober up.
