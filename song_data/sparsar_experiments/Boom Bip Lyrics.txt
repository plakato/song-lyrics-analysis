Boom Bip Lyrics
by Zion I.

I taste the bitter.
And the sweet.
Sweet and the bitter.
Number one draft pick.
Metaphysic flow spitter.
Sip my elixir strong like pop liquor.
Drink from my flask, kick back till it hits ya.
Hiccup, excused we sipping Jah brew.
Got me so high, hardly know what to do.
Been waiting y'all, glad you finally came through.
Celebration of yaself, family and friends too.
Crew - who - said it's taboo, for me to show my feelings.
Don't you know I'm loving you?
Capiche, release stress at the doormat.
Fresh with the raw rap collapsin' your format.
Backspin again, Jah wait for waste line.
Why hate and waste time, bounce with the bass line.
Follow, to sunsets and tomorrow, why rappers don't never.
Understand they role models, sit with the bottle.
Let it get hollow, bet it get sweaty bout to spit my motto.
Holler back, if y'all call then you got the 'nac.
I'm asking all of my people, where ya loving at?

So don't fight the feeling.
When we got it right here.
We ain't going nowhere.
Open your mind.
When we got it right here.
We ain't going nowhere.

I shot the tribe: death, Judah.
Twelve when I delve.
Deep into your mind.
Praise Jah know yaself.
Wealth is a state in.
The mental debate.
It's all in the fate.
Plant seeds then you wait.
Be patient, banquets of glorious abound.
When the ancient art of living's laid down.
Kings sport ya crown, queens sport ya crown.
Jah brings light, now the cipher goes round.
We build, chill, party, act ill.
Then we back to the lab for some more battle drills.
Skills that's for real, failness is kill, houseless is lost.
In the blizzards of their mills, still I will rise higher.
My ancestors let my soul catch fire.
And serve as a beacon, for lost souls seeking.
A candle per say like in a dark day.
We reaching sky high, help me get by.
Sometimes I need a boost, so I touch the lye.
Don't fight the feeling, when I write.
Revealing I'm a light the mic, with hype.
Mics your fiending for.

Po-Po copper.
Skinny, rap tinted proper.
Drop funk like a sock in ya gym locker.
Pop collars, I rocks impalas.
Meet me at the beach, money rain dollars.
Rhyme scholars, the green and the MP.
I plan to be out like Marcus Garvey.
See we don't, trip on ya sizzle, cocaine and pistols.
Boy that's a issue or two, you can 't see thru the lies.
Control the mind, lord knows I'm trying.
Resign, flip manuscripts It's amp live with the beat.
And boom tick.
