Coming of Age Lyrics
by Xavier Simmons.

I'm always searching for something.
I'm never satisfied.
Maybe it's because I'm never satisfied with myself.
I always need to feel like I'm chasing something.
A goal that I'll never reach.
Yeah, that's it.
I'm chasing happiness.
But deep down I know having a comfortable and stable life.
Is my worst nightmare.
So is that really what I want.
When is it gonna stop feeling.
Like my life is in cruise control.
I'm always asking questions.
But that doesn't exactly mean there's gonna be answers.
The older I get.
I realize that everything isn't yes, no.
Black, white.
Right or wrong.
I never wanna make mistakes.
I never wanna hurt the people I care about.
I want back the lovers I've lost.
And the friends I used to know.
See, in my eyes.
I'm never wrong.
Saying sorry's one of the hardest things for me to do.
You know.
I think out of all the things I've learned in life.
Self control and letting things go.
Will always be the hardest.
But I've got a lot more living to do.
And a lot more mistakes to make.
But I think I'll be okay.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be okay.
