10 Million $ Mortgage Lyrics
by Tyga.


How's it feel to watch your bank account go from a zero.
To a million, I can tell you.
'bout the feeling, I can tell you not.
Build for this shit, my nigga you should leave the building.
Cause when we in the building you gotta be built for real shit.
Real life death threats cause of my icy necklace, what.
You want my chain, will that take away your pain, fuck it.
Take my watch, my rings and my Range.
My 10 million dollar mortgage, you still the same lame.
Motherfucker that ain't want it bad as I did, you ain't rap like I did.
You just say it how you would, but when we talking platinum nigga wood is no.
good.
Born and raised in L.A, we was 'Boyz N tha Hood'.
Yeah, I been turnt up, I been the noise in the hood.
Boys with the boys, jumping out on boys from the bush.
Yeah, now the hardest choice I make is which one should I push.
The Bentley or the Roll Royce, I grew up and got more toys.

Break.

I'm forever 'bout whatever yeah we ready for war.
I ain't dancing on the dope, what I'm selling is pure.
You fascinated with the flow I'm masturbating.
I'm stroking my ego, we know you mad I made it.
Being broke'll make you evil, the love of money will do the same.
Who to blame, either way I need a new Bugatti.
You been hating for a minute you need a new hobby.
You ain't getting paid off that shit, you better lay off that shit, bruh.
I fell in love making it rain on that bitch bruh.
Fell outta love I can't complain about that shit tho.
You see my son yeah he the best of me, give him all the good of me.
Give y'all what's left in me, uh.
Appetite for destruction, I got the recipe.
Everybody eats, but we'll get to that later, let's get to this.
paper.
Cause you ain't doing shit 'til you get to these haters.
Am I getting to you niggas, you getting rich off hating?
Shit, then tell me how's it feel to watch your bank account go from a zero.
To a million, I can tell you 'bout the feeling, I can tell you not.
Build for this shit, my nigga you should leave the building.
Cause when we in the building you gotta be built for real shit.
Real life death threats I'm the overnight success what.
You want my fame, will that take away your pain, fuck it.
Take my watch, my ring and my Range.
My 10 million dollar mortgage, you still the same lame.
Motherfucker that ain't want it bad as I did, you ain't rap like I did.
Ain't have to scrap like I did, ask them niggas from the set you ain't get.
back like I did.
When they lying on you sit back and laugh like I did.
Was my whole career you idea, why they hate me nigga I have no idea.
Back when I had no I.D they knew my name, all I ever knew how to do was do my.
thing.
Hate me now, motherfucker.
