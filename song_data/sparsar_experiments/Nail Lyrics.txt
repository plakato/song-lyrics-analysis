Nail Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.


How am I supposed to survive?
If I don't know what's wrong and what's right.
How am I supposed to know freedom?
If I don't know, I'm living inside.
Cause you've got the nail to my all.
My only chance to know what is what.
Cause you've got the nail to my all.
An object i can't even control.

Set me free.
Pull the nail out with your teeth.
Set me free.
Don't leave me wasted.

The slave hits the cog.
And every neck is turned to grey.
The silence turns to thaw.
And the words make sense in their own way.
But tradition is a slave to it's owner.
And i won't let nobody take it over.
No i won't let nobody take it over.
And on my own life i won't turn a shoulder.
To the fissures that keep us divided.
Can't hold on the quiet.
Can't keep me away.

Set me free.
Pull the nail out with your teeth.
Set me free.
Don't leave me wasted.
