Kissing the wind air in face Lyrics
by Zoomboom.

Kissing the wind air in face climbing trees with 2 fingers things get more.
difficult everday nothing ever changes who knows what can happen next till u.
find out the next day mami dimelo que la que hay if im poor i become rich.
quick verbs become easy off thoughts super markets gets sweeped with money.
night and day look bright lights flashing every direction i go cameras take.
pictures when i got out cameras be shineing like lights in the sky with the.
stars we enable the switchs to the fresh cars we drive around the block never.

to my phone stay high to the ceiling never fall off not to easy to say.
