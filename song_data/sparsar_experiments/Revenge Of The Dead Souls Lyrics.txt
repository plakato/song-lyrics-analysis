Revenge Of The Dead Souls Lyrics
by 666.

The smell of blood magnetizes dark spirits.
A valley where dead ones are howling.
Mutilated, rotting bodies around me.
Are so beautiful in their death.
The divine light died out from their eyes.
Death won this war.
Those few ones still alive.
Are looking up the sky with their eyes crushed by pain.
But in vain. God is shitting on humanity.
Night is slowly descending.
It is coming to take them.
Damned beings.
Assemble here.
Reviling their souls.
Consuming their flesh.
What we can see is only a little bit of the end.
But darkness wins the final battle.
Our sword is made of hatred.
Darkness wins the final battle.
