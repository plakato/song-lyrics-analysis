Fright Night (feat. Busta Rhymes & Swizz Beatz) Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.


Attention please, attention please.
Can I have everybody's attention please.
So humorous, we laugh at all ay'all.
The alliance has now been officially formed.
Ruff Ryder, Flipmode, 2000, it's now official baby.
It's another headbanger.

Swizz Beatz, who hits on your streets every six weeks.
I be on the MP so much that my wrist's weak.
Ain't shit sweet, pile 'em in here.
All my thugs in the clubs start wildin' in here.
Now put your bottles in the air, then light your dutches.
Me and Busta keep it tight like liposucion.
Niggas that don't like me get the knife for frontin'.
Cause one night in the club gets your life on crutches.
You got that whodie, I'll cock that forty.
Flyin' in the 5 with the top back on it.
Stop that shorty, I know you love me.
Probably sample one of my beats then owe me money.
Plus you don't know me money, so stop the rumors.
Before you need the janitors to come mop the room up.
Ryde or Die Volume two, smash the charts.
Now put your hands in the air for the black Mozart, OH!

, Now come on.
, Jump baby come on.
Get your hands up, , now all my ladies do it.
Get your hands up,.
Now let me walk you through it.
, Now come on.
, Jump baby come on.
Get your hands up, , now all my ladies do it.
Get your hands up,.
Now let me walk you through it.

Y'all niggas try to front, I'll send my crew on a hunt.
Bunch of scheming ass niggas smoking gats and blunts.
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode represent.
For the Ruff Ryder, and my nigga Swizz.
And we gonna be here to present.
Y'all niggas with some other shit to bang in the street.
And block the f**k out, bang the f**kin' floor with your feet.
Before we bang y'all niggas all with the heat.
Feed y'all niggas more gutters like a mutherf**kin' all you can eat.
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo.
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo.
From New York to Colorado, so just follow.
I'm living for today and livin' tomorrow.
Open up your mouth, I got somethin' big for you to swallow.
Blow you through the chest with a hollow.
Like the foul shit you waste and transpired right infront the impalo.
Yo, the general Busta Busta shock and memorable.
You know we precious like minerals, and deadly like burials.

Listen, Flipmode and Ruff Ryders bang out hits.
S-W-I two Z's bang out clips.
Bang out chicks, for fun we bang out whips.
Y'all go to war with revolvers that bang out flicks.
Now find me on two-fifth in the summer when it starts.
And iced up, nice cut, new pair of Jordans.
Thinkin' of extortin, nigga your life ain't important.
Your camp hotter than ours?, the f**k y'all snortin'.
My thugs bang out bricks, swing, mix, throw dem grams.
Hash smokers, hopin' more and out of soda cans.
, Whoa! listen man.
Mindin' my business will make you a missin' man.
See the wrist and hand?, got plaques on the wall.
And a fifth in hand, I'll put your back on the wall.
Nigga don't ask me no more about nuttin' you hear.
Just scream and shout and just wild in here.

New York, they ain't ready for it.
A-T-L, they ain't ready for it.
Oh, Oh, Oh, they ain't ready for it.
Whoa, Oh, Oh, they ain't ready for it.
My ladies.
Millenium.
Guns bustin' plenty of them, y'all hear that.
