Another Reason Lyrics
by Akala.


Water cuts rock, so which has more force?
As water shapes the land, it's still willing to change it's course.
So can't even change your own minds? Usually change nothing.
Can't ever blame your own mind? Always blame something.
But in failure, hides opportunity.
In divided communities still residing is unity.
Waiting to show itself soon as we're ready to see it.
Truth is always there, soon as we are ready to be it.
So we can keep pretending what's real is just the senses.
But it is all the same when you're looking with stronger lenses.
So concerned with images, but it's there in the words.
Images are just imagination, thats whats so absurd.
Have you heard the Pig now knows it's fat?
And the Zebra is confused because it's white and it's black?
So what's fact, right and exact when everything changes.
Change the way you look at the world, the world changes.

Instead of reasons to die, find a reason to live.
Instead of reasons to fight, find a reason to give.
Instead of reasons to talk, find a reason to sing.
Instead of reasons to take, find a reason to bring.

Instead of reasons for I, find a reason for we.
Instead of reasons to try, find a reason to be.
Instead of reasons to look, find a reason to see.
People, I am pleading, find another reason.

We are so busy noticing money don't grow on trees.
We forgot that food does and that it's the food that we need.
You see, I done traveled all over the Isles.
And seen the poorest people with the wealthiest smiles.
So what is Rich or Poor, Less or More?
What's victory? What's defeat? And who keeps the score?
Who sleeps more soundly, the Prince or the Pauper?
Who speaks more profoundly, the Professor or just the talker?
The walker or the driver, who travels the furthest?
The explorer or the pirate, who is providing a service?
Who decides what is worthless, versus what has a purpose?
Did the so-called civilized world not think the earth a flat surface.
yesterday?
So, who knows what tomorrow brings?
It often is the oddest of songs that tomorrow sings.
Look back through the ages, everything changes.
Change the way you look at the world, the world changes.

Breakdown:.
We find all these reasons.
To never be the person we want to be.
Because I'm still healing.
All these wounds that are burned.
So deep inside of me.

We think that we're smart and that makes us dumb.
Think that we feel the most and that makes us numb.
Weak because we're convinced that we have the power.
Because we can make buildings and guns, but not a single flower.
We're just waves but think we're the ocean.
Because it's easier then admitting.
We don't know where the current is going.
We're just flowing.
Why do we feel it needs controlling?
Waves just rolls with the ocean until they reach the sand.
So let's roll with our part, until we reach our land.
Acknowledge that the fear in our hearts, totally in our hands.
It's not a thing, we just think.
Imagine the Earth decided that it was afraid to spin?
So don't be afraid, to sing with your voice.
That's what it is for.
The more we run from truth, the closer it gets to your door.
Look back through the ages, everything changes.
Change the way you look at yourself, the self changes.
