Back To Life Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Back To Life.

When I thought it was over.
I decided to leave a part of me aside.
To find now I'm older.
I wanted to keep my love alive.
I walked my share of dirty streets.
I held my head I kept my feet.
Now I'm alive.

When I thought it was over.
I decided to raise a fire high.
At night and I screamed out.
I started to feel my love had died.
And when that shadow smothered me.
You found me lost I could not breathe.
But I survived.

I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no.
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no.

And when I thought it was over.
You alighted to reach a part of me inside.
The night that I screamed out.
You started to bring me back to life.
A stream that led me to the sea.
A light I chased in front of me.
Now I'm alive.

I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no.
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no.
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no.
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no.

Ooh, and when the days felt long.
Ooh, I'd never felt so wrong.

I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no.
I wouldn't be the man I am without your love, no.

Ooh, and when the days felt long.
Ooh, I'd never felt so wrong.
