Bang Bang Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

This is where the highway ends.
don't know.
From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air.
Oh, here I go again, singing.
Said I know a place called the Broken Wheel where we can try our luck.
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sherriff claims that he.
I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear.
BANG BANG.

BANG BANG.
That cell door's closing in.
Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear.
DRIVE FOOL DRIVE.
Here I go again.
Here I go again.

Oh, I picked her up.
Somewhere south of Winslow the road went right and I went left.
Five miles north of 66, behind old man Lester's barn.
Oh, I must've been outta my mind.
Sure enough that girl was real, sitting in my truck.
Those chains around my legs.


Oh, blue lights in my eyes.
BANG BANG.
BANG BANG.
When the door flew open - she came out screaming.

BANG BANG.
Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes.
4 AM I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear.

Nothing out my window but desert, dirt, and death.
