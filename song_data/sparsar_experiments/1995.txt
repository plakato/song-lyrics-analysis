Ever since i was seven 
It's evident, i need medicine 
Professors on a pedestal. 
Tellin me im a rebel and 
When. The kid turned eleven 
They heckled me for my mellanin 
So. I jus started swellin em 
Brief as a pelican 
Bars tough, like chewin pemican 
Brighter than thomas edisons 
Light bulb. He invented 
Attention come to the center stage. 
You dont need to reserva 
Tions on the mezzanine 
Get drunk go after the fifth, like the second string, 
I rep, the team WB 
Whatever the day 
You find my niggas runnin with me. 
Whatever the cause 
Spit dragon breath 100 degree 
For better for worse 
Myniggas. I got you 
Bless you niggas acchoooo, 
Be, careful, the watchers'll watch, you 
Bitches'll top. You then rock. You then come back. Just like i got you 
So watch em. They watch you 
Send em way. Like apostles apostles. You got to 
Stay original, because imposters will watch you 
They copy. They got to 
Bitches gettin vicious like raptors vellossal 
Bitches on my dick, because my tracks is collossal, 
Call, em, stop and shops with a cash ear and they stock. You 
 
Fuck your feed back 
I. Can'T front like i need that 
Take, your l-o- double s! If you niggas dont believe that 
Im cre-epin up onto the-map 
Im too good, i mean that 
 
New, chick jus, wan na roll, a dutch and smoke and fuck and toke it up and toke it
up 
Im loafered up. I broke it up, lets overdose from bud and such 
Good thing thats impossible. You still can't smoke in pub- 
Lic, but everybody doesss-itt 
Mind as well. Keep ya bluuunnntt lit 
I. Wake up to head you, wake up to stress, 
I, wake up and work t get my cake up. Instead, 
I plan and i plot without plannin to stop 
These kicks drop. Jean Claude Van damnit im hot 
The canibus got its advantages. 
The worst thing. That happened is my stamina dropped 
But damnit, I'm hot
