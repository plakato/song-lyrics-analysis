Ever since i was seven.
It's evident i need medicine.
Professors on a pedestal.
Tellin me im a rebel and.
When the kid turned eleven.
They heckled me for my mellanin.
So i jus started swellin em.
Brief as a pelican.
Bars tough like chewin pemican.
Brighter than thomas edisons.
Light bulb he invented.
Attention come to the center stage.
You dont need to reserva.
Tions on the mezzanine.
Get drunk go after the fifth like the second string.
I rep the team WB.
Whatever the day.
You find my niggas runnin with me.
Whatever the cause.
Spit dragon breath 100 degree.
For better for worse.
Myniggas i got you.
Bless you niggas acchoooo.
Be careful the watchers'll watch you.
Bitches'll top you then rock you then come back just like i got you.
So watch em, they watch you.
Send em way like apostles, apostles, you got to.
Stay original because imposters will watch you.
They copy, they got to.
Bitches gettin vicious like raptors, vellossal.
Bitches on my dick because my tracks is collossal.
Call em stop and shops with a cash ear and they stock you.

Fuck your, feed back.
I can't front like i need that.
Take your l-o- double s if you niggas dont believe that.
Im cre-epin up onto the-map.
Im too good i mean that.

New chick jus wanna roll a dutch and smoke and fuck and toke it up and toke it.
up.
Im loafered up, i broke it up, lets overdose from bud and such.
Good thing thats impossible you still can't smoke in pub-.
Lic, but everybody doesss-itt.
Mind as well keep ya bluuunnntt lit.
I wake up to head, you wake up to stress.
I wake up and work, t get my cake up instead.
I plan and i plot without plannin to stop.
These kicks drop Jean Claude Van damnit im hot.
The canibus got its advantages.
The worst thing that happened is my stamina dropped.
But damnit I'm hot.
