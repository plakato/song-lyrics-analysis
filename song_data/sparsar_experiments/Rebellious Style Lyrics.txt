Rebellious Style Lyrics
by Zippy Kid.

Do you feel the harmony? What up toe! Push the panic button!
I'm blasting through the galaxy.
I wanna involve ya in this happy affair.
Are you glaming? Are you dancing? Are you revolving?
Why don't ya copy me and my showy individuality.
I'm too racy personage on this dreary stage?
I will bring the satisfaction; my rhymes are the pink of perfection.
Rise up and walk in the light!
You seemed prepared to be pleased and surprised.
This is the extreme competition in the cosmic squeeze.
Are you ready to refine your mind?
Wake up! Are you ready to refine your mind? Step Outside!
I realized we must change the world with this rebellious style.
My name is Zippy Kid; you can also call me Zippy Raptile.
We have no choice: rebellious style is out trade.
These simple words I dedicate for all freaks, for all young cheeks.
Clap your hands, twist your hips, I decided to scratch this mix.
We have no choice: the world is burning under her tender wings.
That hit the mark. I begin the leap in the dark.
I'm catching the spark of your sunshine.
She can't hide. She's mine. Now I'm showing my emotional spate.
Do you feel the harmony? When I got the trouble I wade it through.
Rebellious style is out trade.
These simple words I dedicate for all freaks, for all young cheeks.
Clap your hands, twist your hips. Hey, I decided to scratch this mix.
I don't like to see the empty space, after the short space of break.
All who like my modern craze, ya'll must dance, I set the pace, you take it.
all.
Let it rip I said. shake'n'roll,c'mon....
