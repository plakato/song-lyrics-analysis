Family Reunion Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


Soul of the continent, rebirth of common sense.
Redirect energy, we reflect God within.
Mostly of yall forgotten them, trust me this is not the end.
I was promised victory, before it's done I got to win.
Mama, I'mma take it back, reconcile the sky and earth.
Hate and disrespected you so long, brought down a course.
Drought, famine, earthquakes, disease.
Tsunamis and they still callin you make believe.
Oh they gonna see if it's the last thing they do.
But they still thinkin shuffling and blastin at you.
Time for intervention, we're severely addicted.
Need a family reunion each year til we fix it.

Mother, father, son, daughter.
Earth, wind, fire, water.
I am part of the all, chaos and divine order.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.

All my goddesses, bitches, gentlemen, thugs.
To all my people round the world sharing my love.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.
Monsters, doctors, defenders of life.
To all my people represent the army of life.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.
Yea.

Free form confidence, floating through consciousness.
Pickin up a tray, went to hell, got prominence.
She broke the populis and we built the metropolis.
Til the city sleeps, bad dreams and broken promises.
Zippin through these documents, I find the consequences heavy.
Let me exchange thoughts for a penny.
Offer 99 to them, we the 99 percent.
We divine kind our minds, we'll conquer all of them, yea.
Let the black goddess slaughter all of them, yea.
Remove ego, remain regal.
Lose the hierarchy, my kings and queens are all equal.
Reachin heaven on earth, you turn the people to my…

Mother, father, son, daughter.
Earth, wind, fire, water.
I am part of the all, chaos and divine order.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.

All my goddesses, bitches, gentlemen, thugs.
To all my people round the world sharing my love.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.
Monsters, doctors, defenders of life.
To all my people represent the army of life.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.
Yea.

Let the sun light burn the gray, black and white turn to beige.
Backbone vertebrae, spinal tap the nerve away.
Far from afraid if they raise taxes on the murder rates.
It may hurt the working class but we are here eternally.
Free – how we prefer to live, each day in search of it.
Needed like dreams from the pineal they nourishment.
Previous on the GMO's, cheeseburger preserving that fucking greedy CFO's.
And socialist conservatives.
We care not who's word it is, they care not who world is this.
While we getting high just to fly through the turbulence.
Feels good to be alive and deserving it.
So ride until we die or it's time to return to…

Earth, wind, fire, water.
Mother, father, son, daughter.
We are all but one.
Nothing but love conquers.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.

All my goddesses, bitches, gentlemen, thugs.
To all my people round the world sharing my love.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.
Monsters, doctors, defenders of life.
To all my people represent the army of life.
Never been real or bring your own if you ask us.
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard.
Yea.
