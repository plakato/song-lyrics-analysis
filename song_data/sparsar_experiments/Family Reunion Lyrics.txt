Family Reunion Lyrics
by Sweatshop Union.


Soul of the continent, rebirth of common sense, 
Redirect energy - we reflect God within 
Mostly of yall forgotten them. Trust me. This is not the end. 
I was promised victory before it's done. I got to win 
Mama I'mma, take it back, reconcile the sky and earth 
Hate, and disrespected you so long brought down a course. 
Drought famine, earthquakes, disease, 
Tsunamis and they still callin. You make believe 
Oh they gon na see. If it's the last thing they do 
But. They still thinkin, shuffling and blastin at you, 
Time for intervention, we're severely addicted 
Need a family reunion. Each year til we fix it. 
 
Mother, father, son, daughter, 
Earth, wind fire, water 
I, am part of the all chaos and divine order. 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
 
All, my goddesses bitches, gentlemen, thugs 
To. All my people round the world sharing my love 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
Monsters doctors, defenders of life 
To, all my people represent the army of life. 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
Yea, 
 
Free form confidence floating through consciousness. 
Pickin up a tray went to hell, got prominence, 
She broke the populis and we built the metropolis 
Til the city, sleeps bad dreams and broken promises. 
Zippin through these documents, I find the consequences. Heavy 
Let me exchange thoughts for a penny, 
Offer 99 to them. We, the 99 percent 
We divine kind, our minds, we'll conquer, all of them, yea 
Let, the black goddess slaughter, all of them yea 
Remove ego, remain regal 
Lose. The hierarchy, my kings and queens are all equal, 
Reachin, heaven on earth. You turn the people to my… 
 
Mother, father son, daughter, 
Earth, wind fire, water 
I am part of the all chaos and divine order. 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
 
All, my goddesses bitches, gentlemen, thugs 
To. All my people round the world sharing my love 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
Monsters doctors, defenders of life 
To, all my people represent the army of life. 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
Yea, 
 
Let, the sun light burn the gray black and white turn to beige 
Backbone, vertebrae spinal tap the nerve away, 
Far from afraid. If they raise taxes on the murder rates, 
It may hurt the working class, but we are here eternally 
Free – how we prefer to live each day in search of it. 
Needed like dreams from the pineal. They nourishment 
Previous on the GMO's cheeseburger, preserving that fucking greedy CFO's 
And socialist conservatives 
We care, not who's word it is they care not who world is this 
While we getting high just to fly through the turbulence, 
Feels good to be alive and deserving it 
So ride Until we die or it's time to return, to… 
, 
Earth, wind fire, water, 
Mother, father son, daughter, 
We, are all but one 
Nothing but love conquers 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
 
All, my goddesses bitches, gentlemen, thugs 
To. All my people round the world sharing my love 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
Monsters doctors, defenders of life 
To, all my people represent the army of life. 
Never been real or bring your own. If you ask us 
Get your hands up, we living long in this bastard 
Yea
