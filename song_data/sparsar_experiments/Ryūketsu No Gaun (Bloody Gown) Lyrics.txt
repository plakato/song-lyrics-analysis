RyÅ«ketsu No Gaun (Bloody Gown) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


I'm out here sittin', uh.
I'm out here sittin', uh.
I'm out here sittin' down on the ground.
I see spirits coming down now.
I think they really want me now, now.
Cause I got the sharpest sword in town.
I see this girl but she won't turn around.
And I think I know the reason now.
She got blood all over her gown.
I feel like a nigga dead now.
What's that saying they be saying now?
What don't kill you will come back around.
They better stay up out the way now.
Or I will slam everyday now.
I'm smoking weed, tryna' keep count.
But the blood spills around my house.
Round one, till the time's out.
Round two, I'm gonna kill you now.
Don't get mad, nigga don't be sad.
You hating on me cause I'm smoking sacks.
I got something just for all of that.
Then kill him and bring that body back.

Feeling something like Aaron Carter.
Beat Shaq then I fuck your daughter.
Lean back and turn up the squadda.
Pick a fucking rapper, bet I'm going harder.
Kitchen knife in my right pocket, black bandanna wrapped 'round that bitch.
I pour a cup, I roll a blunt.
I flick ash then I down that bitch.
I ain't tryna' be your favorite, I'd rather let you hate me.
Young X-Pac, I'm throwing suck it, your girlfriend wanna date me.
Your first love wanna rape me, your new girl wanna take me.
Into her room, cut off the lights, turn on the Sesh and get naked.
You faking, I'm rapping, see when you're sad I'm happy.
You still at home in your mama's basement.
My style clean, you nappy.
Your whole shit just tacky, my whole team boombastic.
Your bitch and angel I fucking got, so like Shao Kahn I'm laughing.
It wasn't me when you ask her, peaches and cream when she gasping.
She take it all, she got no shame.
She sees Bones, it's that master.
No matter what I say my skin is white, so they always gon' hate me.
They think I'm trying, my fucking rhyming got females going crazy.
