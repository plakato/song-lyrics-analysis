RyÅ«ketsu No Gaun (Bloody Gown) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


I'M out here, sittin' uh 
I'm out here, sittin' uh 
I'm out here, sittin' down on the ground, 
I see spirits coming down now, 
I think they really want me now now 
Cause, I got the sharpest sword in town. 
I see this girl, but she won't turn around 
And. I think I know the reason now. 
She got blood all over her gown 
I feel like a nigga dead. Now, 
What's that saying they be saying now, 
What don't kill, you will come back around 
They, better stay up out the way now 
Or. I will slam everyday now. 
I'M smoking weed tryna', keep count 
But the blood spills around my house 
Round one till the time's out. 
Round two I'm gon na kill you now 
Don't get mad nigga, don't be sad. 
You hating on me cause I'm smoking. Sacks 
I got something just for all of that: 
Then kill him and bring that body back 
 
Feeling something like Aaron Carter, 
Beat Shaq. Then I fuck your daughter, 
Lean back and turn up the squadda 
Pick, a fucking rapper bet, I'm going harder, 
Kitchen knife in my right pocket black bandanna wrapped'round that bitch 
I pour a cup. I roll a blunt 
I flick ash. Then I down that bitch 
I ain't tryna', be your favorite I'd. Rather let you hate me 
Young X-Pac, I'm throwing suck it your girlfriend wan na date me 
Your. First love wan na rape me, your new girl, wan na take me 
Into her room cut off the lights, turn on the Sesh and get naked 
You faking. I'M rapping see when you're sad, I'm happy 
You still at home in your mama's basement, 
My style clean. You nappy 
Your whole shit, just tacky my whole team, boombastic, 
Your, bitch and angel. I fucking got so like Shao Kahn, I'm laughing 
It. Wasn'T me when you ask her peaches and cream when she gasping 
She. Take it all. She got no shame. 
She sees Bones. It'S that master 
No matter what I say my skin is white, so they always gon' hate me 
They. Think I'm trying my fucking rhyming got females going crazy
