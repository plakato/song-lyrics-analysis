All God's people Lyrics
by Queen.


So, all you people give freely 
Make welcome inside your homes, 
Thank God you people, give freely 
Don't turn your back on the lesson of the Lord 
All prime ministers and majesty around the world. 
Open your eyes look touch and feel 
Rule with your heart 
Live with your conscience, 
And love, love, 
Love, love and be 
Love love and be free. 
We'Re. All God's people, 
 
Got, to face up 
Better, grow up 
Got to stand tall and be strong 
Got to face up 
Better grow up 
 
Got to face up 
Better, grow up 
Got to stand tall and be strong 
Got to face up 
Better grow up 
We're. All God's people 
 
Yeah, 
 
Yeah yeah. Yes, there was this magic light. 
I said to myself: 
I'd better, go to bed and have an early night 
Then. I then I then I then I went into a dream 
Rule with your heart and live with your conscience. 
We'Re, all God's people give freely 
Make welcome inside your homes. 
Let us be thankful, He's so incredible: 
 
We're, all God'sx3 
We're, all God's people, 
We're all God's 
We're, all God's peoplex2
