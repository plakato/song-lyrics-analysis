My Calliope Lyrics
by Rune.


I must save you from my confession.
I must hide this subtle separation.
Can I say this lie is a lesson?
40 lashes for selfish intentions.

Watching dust in the bathwater collect itself.
Like galaxies at the end of time.
Surrounded by moss and trees I'd feel only the dampness.
You storm and rage and feel.
I remain only placid.

I must save you from my confession.
I must hide this subtle separation.
Can my guilt be my redemption?
Carrying the weight of my conscience as a sentence.

This is a sombre ode to the molecule of smoke.
She has no choice but to follow where the air flows.
A serene existence calmly out of control.
I'm pleading ignorance of where this current will go.

Did I forget to feel something?
Somewhere along the way.
But I will try to feel for you.
Make me fall.
Am I even a human at all?

How can I let go of this seemingly impossible.
Obstacle an affront to my well being.
I want all the love in the world.

Watching dust in the bathwater collect itself.
Like galaxies at the end of time.
Surrounded by moss and trees I'd feel only the dampness.
You storm and rage and feel.
I remain only placid.
