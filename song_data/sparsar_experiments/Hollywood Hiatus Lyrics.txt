Hollywood Hiatus Lyrics
by U-N-I.


Cool it now.
Slow it Down.

They better cool it now.
Got more reason to act foolish now.
Your broad is like we goin' do this now.
Says she just wanna taste my style.

She knows Im sicker than, crew.
More thicker than you.
Tryin' to bicker and fight.
And compare to us in real life like.
NO!
U-N-I crew, we fly like bullets on strays.
Which yo main you better get low.
It's hard to enjoy life like I do.
With more drank in my cup, mix it up.
With the brown skin chick with good hur.
Tell her she can park that ass right hur.
So fuck beef dog what you mad fo'.
About good music and the cash flow.
Flow 51-50 and a 59-50 fitted like 50.

Look to the sky.
Get the dough up.
Need the whip with the doors that raise up.
Hollywood Hiatus... Thumbs up to the haters.

We want the models that pop bottles.
So trace the steps, now you can follow.
Hollywood Hiatus.
Thumbs up to the haters.

They better cool it now.
Got more reason to act foolish now.
Your broad is like we goin' do this now.
Says she just wanna taste my style.

Wow!
It go Yonas, Yannick, Roblvd hur.
With fly girls on my hip like the phone that chirp.
We that popular....
Fake posers tryina copy us....
Say Hi to the guy.
I don't need a wife.
So I rotate em with the big hand goin clockwise.
And it's a quarter past 2.
Im 15 minutes over while Im hangin with you.
Used to be a fan of heels.
Now with sneaker play kicks with chicks that are ill.
So don't cry, here go a couple of change.
Buy a Coke maybe that'll bring a smile.

Look to the sky.
Get the dough up.
Need the whip with the doors that raise up.
Hollywood Hiatus... Thumbs up to the haters.

We want the models that pop bottles.
So trace the steps, now you can follow.
Hollywood Hiatus.
Thumbs up to the haters.

Y-O &amp; Thurzday alternate lines.
No time for hate.
I'll BRB for that LOL.
SMH at the fake.
Send smiley face to the girl named Suzy.
And her BFF with ass like a movie.
Watch it!
Tryina get a number in my pocket.
Or maybe an address to get in your dress.
See the aim is the please.

Look to the sky.
Get the dough up.
Need the whip with the doors that raise up.
Hollywood Hiatus... Thumbs up to the haters.

We want the models that pop bottles.
So trace the steps, now you can follow.
Hollywood Hiatus.
Thumbs up to the haters.
