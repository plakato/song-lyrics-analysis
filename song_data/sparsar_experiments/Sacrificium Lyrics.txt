Sacrificium Lyrics
by Xandria.

In this dark cell.
In this moment of life and death.
On bloody fields of war.
In a forsaken desert.
Or an empty street.
In a family´s home.
Every place where love, hate, greed, belief.
Let men look into the barrel of a gun.

You can take my life.
But my vision lives on eternally.

This is my legacy, now I will be forever.
I am one with my fate, now I will see destiny.
I give all of myself for all I love in this world.
It will be my last wish, my ultimate Sacrifice.

I give all for you.

I see the white light so close.
Today, there I´ll be going.
There are no questions no more.
There´s only knowing.

My last hour, I have nothing to regret.
Nothing left that I could give to you.
I have gone, taken everything with me.
Everything that I could hide from the pain.
That takes away my body.

Hold my hand wherever you are.
My end now is just a new life for you all.
This is my promise, my sacrifice.

My life was once just like yours.
But then it happened.
All has changed in a minute, like a shot.
All the world, it was nothing like before.
I have run through the chaos in mind.
All my life, but I never knew.
What´s lying deep inside of us all.

How hard they ever will hit my face.
Or even break every bone.
No matter how long it takes for me.
I will not fail.

How far I have to go for my hope.
Or have to step into fire.
No one can anymore hold me from.
Falling down now.

My heart is beating on and on.
It feels like falling down now.

Hold my hand wherever you are now.
Please hold my hand, keep me from falling down.

My old life seems like centuries ago.
I remember scenes from my childhood.
Playing Robin Hood and Braveheart.
But how do we know what we do.
When the story is about us.
Now I know.

I will live on, my will lives on.
Here I stand finally.
With my life in my Hands.
Let the sword fall down.

Farewell to you all stars above.
Goodbye to all the ones that I have loved.
I miss you so much, but it´s ok.
I´ll sleep well cause somewhere you are save.
This I know when I take my last breath.
