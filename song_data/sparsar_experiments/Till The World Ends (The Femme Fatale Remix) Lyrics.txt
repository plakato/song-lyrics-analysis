Till The World Ends (The Femme Fatale Remix) Lyrics
by Twister.

Britney.
Till the world ends... Remix.

Nicki Minaj.
Hi.
Chimpanzee's is hatin' but I take it all in stride.
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side.
Told you they'd revive you, sorry but somebody lied.
I ain't talking poultry when I say this chicken's fried.
Anyway Britney, why they so jealous that you teamed up with me.
Tell 'em they my son, yup, yella I'mma pick me.
Anyway, burned , whats that, I don't know, femme fatale.
Sniff, sniff, cries, I done slayed your whole entire f**kin' life.
Oh oh, you got them ? out.
I done balled all day you ain't touch the court.
What, what you tired, you need a break.
You was hot when? Ricki Lake!

Britney.
I notice that you got it.
You notice that I want it.
Know that I can take it to the next level baby.
If you understood this, this is the remix.
Baby let me blow your mind tonight.

Nicki.
It's Britney bitch.
I'm Nicki Minaj and that's Ke$ha.

Ke$ha.
I can't take it, take it.
Take no more.
Never felt like, felt like this before.
C'mon get me, get me on the floor.
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?

WOAH OH OH OH OH OH WOAH OH OH OH....
WOAH OH OH OH OH OH WOAH OH OH OH....

Watch me move when I loose when I lose it hard.
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark.
You notice what I'm wearin'.
I notice you starin.
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby.
Hotter than the A-List.
Next one on my hitlist.
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight.

Ke$ha.
I can't take it, take it.
Take no more.
Never felt like, felt like this before.
C'mon get me, get me on the floor.
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?

Britney.
See the sunlight.
We ain't stoppin'.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
If you feel it let it happen.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.

Ke$ha.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.

Remix.
Woah oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh…

Britney.
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh oh oh oh…
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh oh oh oh…
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh oh oh oh…
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh oh oh oh…

Britney.
See the sunlight.
We ain't stoppin'.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
If you feel it let it happen.
Keep on dancing till the world ends.
