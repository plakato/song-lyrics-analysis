Ripping Through Time Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

Now a blinding flash before me.
All at once I can not see.
There a spatial gap is looming, anomaly.
Something draws me through the curtain.
A force only I can feel.
Is this the end of my siege?

Eons and light-years away.
Far beyond the fires of our sun.
Legend will carry this day on and on!

There's no forsaking what little time we have.
It's for the taking, a new momentum.

Caught within a spinning vortex.
No direction, time or place.
Falling toward a destination, uncharted space.
Will this rid me of the demons.
Lashed upon my soul's disgrace.
Or will they simply give chase?

There's no forsaking what little time we have.
It's for the taking, a new momentum.

Wandering the hallways of my life.
The visions frozen just for me.
Every mistake I've ever made, displayed.

The chance to liberate me from my crimes.
My soul's rebirth; recovery.
I'll tear away and purge my past at last.
Anew.

Defy the laws of quantum gravity.
Break through the dimension.
Hide in a world of super-symmetry.
A space-time horizon.
