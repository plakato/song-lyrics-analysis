Beneath The Stars Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


Walk Beneath the sun, Lie beneath the stars.
We grow upon the earth, And this is what we are.

On the bathroom floor with a blade in my hand in a puddle of piss.
Over coming darkness thinking where did shit go wrong if its coming to this.
Take a bottle of the Advil, hoping it'll kill me if I only go to sleep.
It's to late to go back now, shit, so I slit my wrists now I'm in this shit.
deep.
Looking at the blood run, a couple drips then shit now it's on like a puddle.
Now I'm in trouble, nothing I can do right now, only run for my shuttle.
Blood started gushing I could feel my soul was rushing, I fucked up and now my.
former self is leaving.
Everybody get they reasons and, this shit is all exterior, no more internal.
bleeding.
I remember when I was a little kid, hide in trash can lids always suffering.
abrasions.
I would always talk to my friends like, Time and time again another day.
another beatin'.
They say time heals all wounds but I've been fucked up ever since I was a.
child.
So troubled and wild, why you think in every school picture I never did smile.
Ain't been happy in a while.
But I remain humble, they tell me I'm an animal, what the fuck else you.
expect? I grew up in a jungle.
And now I'm all fucked up on the bathroom floor just sittin' here bleedin'.
Thinkin' 'bout leavin' before my son come in and see me not breathin.
'.

And now I'm all fucked up with a bullet in my chest and I'm prayin' to Jesus.
Never did before but fuck it if I go right now they'll be all ? believers.

It's funny how niggas all get to praying when they get up in a situation.
If you go right now in the end, do you think God is the one you'll be facin'.
Maybe it could be satan, shit maybe nobody could be waitin'.
Maybe we all end up in a fuckin' box with a lid on top, shit is up for.
debating.
But the fact of the matter is if I don't know then you don't know either.
Brain washed as a kid to believe in your parents' beliefs, just ask the.
preacher.
I was in the corner by myself looking at the other kids, knowin' I was.
different.
I was gifted, and it's been that way ever since I was an infant.
Brain off in the distance, Never thought my shit could be rattled.
Lost in a den, cause I'm knowin' I be off in the pen if a nigga do tattle.
One bite of an apple, niggas sufferin' the root of all evil.
People that get shot and stabbed but nobody laugh at the murderin' of all.
people.
And now I'm all fucked up on the bathroom floor just sittin' here bleedin'.
Thinkin' 'bout leavin', before my son come in and see me not breathin'.

In the bathroom with a glass half full but a pool half empty.
Stumbling back, barely can walk, Do you wanna take another shot?
Don't tempt me.
I will have enemized my own life from my own actions.
Learn from mistakes and every move that a nigga make will cause a reaction.
I blacked out last night all that I can recall was I was faded.
Standin' on top of a rock at a bonfire screamin' I fuckin' made it!
My life I fuckin' hate it, I'm a full blown alchy.
My life's in danger, they tell me I'm a perfect stranger, just like Balki.
Feelin' so independent, feelin' like I was killin' 'em, walkin' up on a.
station, I'mma hit 'em with venom like it was ten of 'em.
Fill 'em with ?? and.
then murder 'em with the verbal and people'll call it venomous.
But shit, that's only life for the moment, how can I win when time's my.
opponent?
I don't care so I'mma keep winnin' and push to the wind like I've been.
annointed.
I've been avoided by the whole world cause a nigga only had one pair of.
clothes.
Sleepin on the sidewalk, right there on the sidewalk, you people don't know.

And now I'm all fucked up on the bathroom floor just sittin' here bleeding.
Thinkin' 'bout leavin', before my son come in and catch me not breathin'.
