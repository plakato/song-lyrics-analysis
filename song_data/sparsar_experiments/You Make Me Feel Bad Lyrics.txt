You Make Me Feel Bad Lyrics
by Wood.

I could say the things that make it happen.
I'd use all the words that lovers use.
I could give the looks that time has given.
But this time I'll look away from you.
Maybe it ain't right and maybe I'll miss you.
Maybe it ain't the easiest thing that I'm gonna do.
You have made me feel Incomprehensible sometimes pretty bad.
I thought I was crazy but you're the one that's mad.
Stand up and take a bow for all that you have done.
And if you touch yourself.
You'll have to find someone else to blame.
Maybe in the light of day you'll forgive me.
See it now for what it really was.
In another time it could all be different.
Honey, I was strong but you were not.
Maybe it ain't right and maybe I'll miss you.
Maybe it ain't the easiest thing that I'm gonna do.
You have made me feel sometimes pretty bad.
I thought I was crazy but you're the one that's mad.
Stand up and take a bow for all that you have done.
Cause if you touch yourself.
You'll have to find someone else to blame.
Maybe it ain't right, maybe I'll miss you.
Maybe it ain't the easiest thing that I'm gonna do.
You have made me feel sometimes pretty bad.
I thought I was crazy but you're the one that's mad.
Stand up and take a bow for all that you have done.
Cause if you touch yourself.
You'll have to blame someone.
