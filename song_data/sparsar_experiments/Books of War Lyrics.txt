Books of War Lyrics
by Wonder.


Dropping 16's, with a heart full of evil. 
Rather have my teeth: full of gold 
Than be a weasel, its all about
decieval 
Once, i'm coming with this evil power called my thoughts 
I be causing mass murder like the fucking holocaust. 
You talk about your money, but how much that dollar cost 
Im in the streets with nothing but a pen and a molotov 
Wondering. How much my bottle cost 
my book of war taught people to live or die trying 
But, even the people, with 20/20 vision can be blinded with the lying 
Have animosity building inside'em 
Im blowing haze connecting to my asylum 
Hearing, the painful scream of society dying, 
Im surviving In a manner people say is too violent, 
Cuz for the rest of the new school. I plan a columbining 
With, my new school style, with my old school flow 
My, barely aged body with my ancient soul, 
Yeah uh, my name is wonder: 
A kid with no morals taught to rob and plunder 
But rhyming while taking cover a shooter, not a lover. 
That was born in the summer lord
forgive me, for. I have sinned 
For, pushing the manner of free thoughts all up on these kids 
And y'all. Looking at me funny like I split they fucking wigs, wussup
, 
, 
Beat, fades
