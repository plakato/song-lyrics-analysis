Nefarious Verses Lyrics
by X-Raided.


These are the thug songs.
It was my destiny.
To carry the curse.
It was written so let it be.

This is my legacy.
Consider it food for thought.
This is my recipe.
These are the thug songs.
Hellish and heavenly.
I can see the light ahead of me.
Maybe I'll rest in peace.

This is my legacy.
Consider it food for thought.
This is my legacy.

Close the eyes as I describe the picture and visualize the scene in your.
mind's eye.
As I scribe the scripture.
And come with me.
Absorb the words.
Its a metaphorical decapitation and its sword to words.
Leave behind your politics, opinions, and commentary.
Just listen.
Doesn't require any religion.
Let go of your beliefs until you spiritually bare.
So your preconception won't render your hearing in here.
Now that you're prepared.
I got a story to share.
And it's from a unique perspective - this story is rare.
I've seen the light.
I witnessed the glorious glare.
Of the truth and it was almost too much for me to bear.
One day I asked myself.
'Is this the way I was meant to be'?
I had an epiphany I was living in misery.
An evil man more destructive and crazy.
I tried to fight the truculent thoughts but my mind depraved me.
Is this the way God designed me, made me?
Or is that just an excuse in all truths they say God's a maybe.
So many questions.
Don't know who to seek for answers.
Should I speak a preacher or a necromancer.
I was standing on the brink of insanity.

Wasn't half the man I planned to be.
I wanted to know who taught me misanthropy - was it life or my family.
I wanted to know.
Why couldn't my parents unite.
They should raised me together taught me to be fair and do right.
And I wanted to know.
Why my soul was prone to drama.
I was floating in darkness and I'm so far from over.
When I was young.
A figure stood at the foot of my bed.

Was it a dream or a sign of all things to come?
I'll find out on the day that God's kingdom comes.
But right now....

I was forced to contemplate.
It was involuntary.
I couldn't stop thinking I was locked in solitary.
Surrounded by white walls.
Sensually deprivated.
It was like light pauls.
Mentally devestating.
Like Cast Away.
I was stranded in my own brain.
Stashed away.
Couldn't remember my own name.
It lasted for days in the zone causing my own pain.
Up until that point in my life I hadn't known pain.
But my identity.
I started to recollect.
Recalling my memory.
I started to retrospect.
A theme played in my mind - started to reminisce.
Review the instance when I discarded my innocence.
A delusional image was it a vision or fantasy?
Was I losing my mind, losing my sanity?
I called out to my creator.
Forgive me for all the lies.
And I asked but got no reply.
How passionate was my cry.
It flashed before my eyes.
I saw my creator.
It was me.
I'm responsible for all my behavior.
My thoughts clear.
By walking through the flames I was purified.
In the fire I've been doing for life.
I tried to kill the renaissance.
So my soul was banged and bruised.
Through the experience I gained the truth.
And in response I'm hoping I can change the views.
My generation needs a voice of thugs bangs to you.
Who can explain the views.
In all pain.
I've written this in plain English.
Like Sam Clements.
So call me Dark Twain.
Written to see.
For all the young in the ghetto.
Thug songs continue to be sung in the ghetto.
Let these preach in all the slums in the ghetto.
Cause in the Bible.
Jesus comes from the ghetto.
And I come from the ghetto.
So I speak for the ghetto.
These words and these tears.
My soul beats for the ghetto.
