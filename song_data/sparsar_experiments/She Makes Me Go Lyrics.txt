She Makes Me Go Lyrics
by Arash.

She makes me go oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh Ra ba ba dam dam dam diggy diggy.
Arash!
Sean paul!
She makes me go!
She makes me go!
Bring that body, come give me girl.
I got to think I can rock your world.
Bring that body, come give me girl.
A long time I'ma lock you girl!
Drop it girl, then pop it girl.
Don't push my button, suck it girl.
Give me the sexy one.
Make me go cocky girl.

She makes me go oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Show me? make me feel high.
Then go boom like daddy yankee.
Touch upon the sky.
Tell so right, make me feel high?
Come on girl turn me on!
Ra ba ba dam dam dam diggy diggy.
She makes me go!
She makes me go!
I know just how to keep it.
On and on, bounce it girl.
Til I'm on, move that body.
You got to groove that body.
Lemme see that you can perform.
Tell me to you I'm the champion, Darling, to you I'm the number one.
Spinnin it, then turn it.
Seems that you've earned it.
Knowin' you where to begun.
Bring that body, come give me girl.
I got to think I can rock your world.
Bring that body, come give me girl.
A long time I'ma lock you girl!
Drop it girl, then pop it girl.
Don't push my button, suck it girl.
Give me the sexy one.
Make me go cocky girl.

She makes me go oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh.
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh.
