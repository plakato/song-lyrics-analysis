Divine Disaster Lyrics
by XO (Producer).


Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh.
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh.
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh.
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh.
Oh-oh-ooo-oooh.

Forgive my sins I had become weaker with each day.
Temptation caught me good, she won't let go.
My innocence taken from me with each word she say.
Walkin' back through the fire for my soul.

This love won't last us.
Divine disaster, oh-oh.
Caught out and captured by the.
Puppet master, oo-oh.
This love won't last us.
Divine disaster, oh.
Came back to the fire for my soul.

For my soul.
Eh-eh-eeeh.

Oh lord I beg, running circles in the warzone.
As she whispers all those sweet, sweet lies.
On my last legs, almost helpless in battle alone.
Manipulated, she controls my mind.

This love won't last us.
Divine disaster, oh-oh.
Caught up and captured by the.
Puppet master, oo-oh.
This love won't last us.
Divine disaster, oh.
Walkin' back to the fire for my soul.

For my soul.
Eh-eh-eeeh.
Eh-eh-eeeh.

Think all she said was truthful friend.
And all the things above this world she did pretend.
In all of this she was a fake.
Afraid the first drink that you bought her was a mistake.

This love won't last us.
Divine disaster, oh-oh.
Caught out and captured by the.
Puppet master, oo-oh.
This love won't last us.
Divine disaster, oh.
Walkin' back to the fire for my soul.
