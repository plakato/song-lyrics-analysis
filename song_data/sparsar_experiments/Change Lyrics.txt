Change Lyrics
by Quarta Quarta.


Grandfather passed away today. Look my mother in the eyes, she don't seem the.
same.
It's 17 degrees outside.
But i don't turn the heater on, cause I'm trying to freeze the pain away.
Does Shenron exist?
If so, I wish for 7k.
Cause that's what I need right now to pay, this health insurance co-pay.
Next month.
My dad has an operation. I pray there's no miscalculations.
Keeping faith, and I'm spreading love.
Cause cancer can't overcome who i serve above.
I deal with things in a different way.
I turn struggle into wordplay.
And there's people out there who hate me, and everything i say.
But you don't know my story, you don't know where I've been.
You don't know my dreams, but you judge me by the way I sin?
Well.
Examine my flaws, but remember one thing.

You're not God.

Or perfect. Or worth it.
So I don't even waste time.
At 17, I'm plotting to change the world.
I need every second for the grind.
Embrace what i am, a Super Saiyan in Vans.
Toss me sweatpants, and this is the plan.
Drop gems, for the world.
And I ain't worried 'bout a girl.
I wonder why do I breathe, But Gem Gang brings unity.
And no matter the range.
I'm grinding for change.

Sample: Neku.

I don't get people.
Never have.
Never will.
