Choose Me Lyrics
by Yung Joc.

I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
You chose me.
You chose me.
And I chose ya.
And I chose ya.
You chose me.
You chose me.
And I chose ya.
Yeah yeaah....
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
I'm single and horny, won't you get up on me.
C'mon baby, give it to me girl.
You should get to know me, but first you gotta show me.
How you gonna rock my world.
And how you gone ride for me, you got your eyes on me.
I'm a pull your cart, after this I win your heart.
Baby you gotta be, the baddest thing in this club.
But first you gotta know....
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
You chose me.
You chose me.
And I chose ya.
And I chose ya.
You chose me.
You chose me.
And I chose ya.
Yeah yeaah....
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
I'm such a leader not a follower.
I know how to do my own thing.
Fall off in the spot dirty d woth the home ting.
Rip the qwip though say your own thing.
MJs wak to criminal with the chrome thing.
I'm on a grown man I'm never outta place.
Ask about my swagg oh yeah, it's outer space.
You'll go by the bar, joc by the whole place.
You buy it buy the bottle I'll pop the whole case.
Posted on the sofa blowing fat spilfs.
Linix small tags I shop at sex spil.
Hard em up the k christian artisha.
Your bitch keep watchin me she thinkin.
What she ought to say.
I'll leave her speechless had your girl.
I can tell she freaky and just don't know how to tell joc.
I gotta leak and vicky secrets on flash floods.
I just need some good lovin I ain't lookin for love.
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-lookin for love.
You chose me.
You chose me.
And I chose ya.
And I chose ya.
You chose me.
You chose me.
And I chose ya.
Yeah yeaah....
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love.
