The Fallen Lyrics
by Unearth.

Broken, the seams burst in a rush.
A cataclysmic horror story 'pens it's lust.
Collision makes a call to change a certain path.
Full disbelief takes it's hold, delay the wrath, delay wrath.

This is for the lost.
This is for the fallen.
You will remain in my world until I rest.

This unrelenting test.
The sting of memories has chased the shadow dark.
To chase them long enough would end in certain death.

No longer solid ground, now grayed the autumn leaf.
A barren road.

Upon the pages of our path.
Bringing great calamity.
Contagious this loss will surely ruin.
There's great calamity ahead.

This is for the lost.
This is for the fallen.
For you'll remain in my world until I rest.
Until I rest you will remain.
