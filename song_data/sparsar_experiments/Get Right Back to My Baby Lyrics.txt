Get Right Back to My Baby Lyrics
by Vivian Green.

What you did to me this morning.
Had me late for work.
I'm stressing.
Missed my meeting.
All I'm thinking 'bout is you, you, you, you.

And now I'm looking at the clock.
Counting the hours till I'm back in your arms.
Wish I never had to let you go.
Oh, oh, oh ooh, oh.

Time can't move fast enough.
Until I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to, ooh.

Stuck in transit.
Off daydreaming.
Missed you there so many reasons.
Most of all.
I really wanna lay with you.
And just feel your touch, babe.

And now I'm looking at the clock.
Counting the hours till I'm back in your arms.
Wish I never had to let you go, oh, oh, oh.
I shoulda never let you go.

Time can't move fast enough.
Until I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to, ooh.

Time can't move fast enough.
Until I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to, ooh.

Baby, I'm addicted to every single part of you.
But I swear this addiction is healthy.
Serve me up another dose.
Be ready, babe.
I'm getting close.

Ooh.
Ooh.
I wish I never had to let you go.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
I.

Time can't move fast enough.
Until I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to, ooh.

Time can't move fast enough.
Until I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to my baby.
I get right back to, ooh.
