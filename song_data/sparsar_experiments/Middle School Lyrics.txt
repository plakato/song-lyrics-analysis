Middle School Lyrics
by Quiet Desperado.

Wake up every morning wishing I wasn't me.
Riding my bike, forgot the lock now my bike is free.
Moved here because my mom wanted a better life for me.
Head butted in the face now I'm icing dying teeth.
And the parents asking “When did kids become so violent?”.
That's what happens when you're put in a hostile environment.

I remember making lists in my head.
Of all the kids that I truly wanted dead.
It's these types of thoughts that scare people the most.
Because a normal kid shouldn't think so demented and gross.
You can't help it when you're pushed too much.
You eat in the bathroom stall everyday for lunch.
Wanting to have one friend who won't make fun.
But they continue and you question turning a gun.
Onto yourself, suicide really was contemplated.
How could it not? They called you fag and you felt truly hated.
Stop showing up to school because of the reasons stated.
Instead I laid in my bed so I wouldn't be berated.
But now I'm Jaded like Will Smith when he got married.
Forced to read books like “The Things That They Carried”.

The things I carried, I'd call them burdens.
Had a nightmare before Christmas, Tim Burton.
My best friend and his family died on their way to Mexico.
And just like that our memories were the first to go.
I still regret what I said before he went.
We had our disagreements and I needed to vent.
I told you off, now I wish that we could circumvent.
Now I'm at your funeral and all I feel is the need to repent.

I'm sorry, I'll say it a thousand times over.
Lookin in the cracks for a four leaf clover.
But there's no luck, just this chip on my shoulder.
Sorry, again I sound so angsty.
I'm just a clown with some darkness like Gacy.
No one's gonna read this, but that doesn't phase me.
I'm waiting for a magnolia to come and save me.
But I'm lonely on this island, So I'm ghost like Swayze.
