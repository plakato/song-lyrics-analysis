6-3-8 (That's The Number To Play) Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

I woke up early this morning, 
Hand in hand Incomprehensible, 
The woman. I love was at the head of my bed. Stand 
The landlord wanted his rent, 
 
I went out on the corner, 
To see what I could do. 
I guess I get to play the races, 
I'm passin' it on to you. 
 
6-3-8 is the number today 
6-3-8. Is the number you better play? 
 
I, don't believe in Gypsy's 
Readin' out the palm of my hand, 
Don't believe in lady luck. 
She just wouldn't understand. 
 
I believe in Joe 
Down by the Candy store 
You. Would too good people 
If? You know just what I know. 
 
6-3-8 is the number today 
6-3-8. Is the number you better play? 
Yeah, you know, 
 
Rusty is pretty fast 
I, just wan na prove you could 
I do hope. You heard what I said: 
Cause there ain't, no okay, do 
 
There ain't no way for you to catch him. 
That is plain to see 
But if you want to get your Rusty 
You, better, listen to me, 
 
6-3-8 is the number to play. 
6-3-8. Is the number that's comin' today 
 
Come on come on now 
Come on come on now 
Come on now, 
 
6-3-8. Is the number that's comin' today, 
6-3-8? Is the number you better play, 
 
Come on all y'all 
Come on don't walk me y'all 
I said come on. Y'All 
I said come on y'all 
 
6-3-8 is the number you better play. 
6-3-8? Is the number that's comin' today? 
 
I ain't, lyin', 
I ain't lyin', 
 
6-3-8 - is the number that's comin' today. 
6-3-8. Is the number you better play? 
 
6-3-8. Is the number you better play 
6-3-8? Is the number that's comin' today, 
 
6-3-8? Is the number that's comin' today. 
6-3-8? Is the number you better play
