by TwoineyLo.

Usual Suspects.

Usual Suspect.
Uhh. Uhh.

Nigga I'mma teen so tell me what new drugs you IMPORTING.
Some niggas EXTORING.
For the wrong REASONS.
On the block INSTAGRAMING.
SAYING their block JAMING.
Man these niggas BLUFFING.
Bum chicks they CUFFING.
Watch they start SNITICHING.
When cops start CUFFING.
HANDS.
I thought you was the MAN.
You a usual suspect.
You ain't no MAN.
Catch me in the Soviet UNION.
Just STALIN.
Wit me KEN aka my blood.
They gave me bread call it COMMUNION.
You thought I was gang REPPING.
Stop IT.
Ya flow.
I Swat IT.
When I'm all dressed I'm on my Fly SHIT.
16 Spitting serious TOPICS.
Hold UP.
Fake niggas fold UP.
When niggas poker.
You not a smoker.
But weed love to play with you.
To muck playing JOKER means out the deck for YOU.
And your CREW.
Smoking that moist grass in the morning.
I know . . that's what you DEW.
But When they stop YOU.
Please don't ask what I DO?
Cause these cops will give you the blues.
My Dogg . ..
For not having a CLUE nigga.

Usual Suspect.
Usual Suspect.
Your skin color makes you a suspect.
Usual Suspect.
Usual Suspect.
Let me know why am I . . . a suspect.
Because I'm Black.
That's not right.
If I was white.
I would be fighting for what's right.
Uhh.
Usual Suspect.
Usual Suspect.
Your skin color makes you a suspect.
Nigga . .,.

Diging for gold thoughts on my mine.
Bus flow.
Wishing I had car though.
If I did.
Speeding through life.
Would be fine.
With me.
And to the G O.
V T.
Instead of helping a brother they rather see M E.
Dead or stuck in poverty.
So they tax me.
For every rhyme I spit.
For every dime a get.
But they wonder why we so fucking violent.
They don't understand.
The pain we withstand as humans.
Believing in god but the church full of nothing but corruption.
Everyday you hear about Somebody dying.
A kid crying.
Because they not eating.
So their brothers slanging.
School is what they skipping.
Corners where they hanging.
They became usual suspects.
10 years later they in jail.
Or buried in the projects.

Usual Suspect.
Usual Suspect.
Your skin color makes you a suspect.
Usual Suspect.
Usual Suspect.
Let me know why am I . . . a suspect.
Because I'm Black.
That's not right.
If I was white.
I would be fighting for what's right.
Uhh.
Usual Suspect.
Usual Suspect.
Your skin color makes you a suspect.
Nigga . .,.

I'm a great thinker like CONFUCIUS.
Never trading on my homies unlike BRUTUS . . . DID.
It's funny how he traded now he DEAD.
I understand the man above.
But to be REALISTIC.
His foe understood me since I was a KID!
But ignorance is BLISS.
So I am.
Wise as Martin but Violent like Maclom.
Thinking &amp; Taking action using nothing but my FIST!
Cause ignorance is BLISS.
Like Jada please Ma tuck me in &amp; give me KISS.
Ignorance is BLISS.
BUT . ..
Its the rebirth.
Of TRAVON.
Chilling &amp; Eating skittles with my hood ON.
I ain't harming nobody.
Mr. ZIMMERMAN.
I ain't harming nobody.
Mr. ZIMMERMAN!
Cause Its the rebirth.
Of TRAVON.
Chilling &amp; Eating skittles with my hood ON.
I ain't harming nobody.
Mr. ZIMMERMAN.
Cause I ain't harming nobody.

So Please Please don't shoot,,.
Please please don't shoot.
George ZIMMERMAN!
