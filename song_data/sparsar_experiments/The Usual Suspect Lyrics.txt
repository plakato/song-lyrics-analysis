The Usual Suspect Lyrics
by TwoineyLo.

Usual Suspects, 
 
Bring that shit back 
Yo. Yo 
Mic Check, 
Yo. Yo, 
Mic, Check., Mic Check; 
For the 
Usual Suspect, 
Uhh. Uhh, 
, 
Nigga, I'mma teen. So tell me what new drugs you IMPORTING? 
Some niggas EXTORING 
For, the wrong REASONS: 
On the block INSTAGRAMING 
SAYING, their block. Jaming 
Man these niggas BLUFFING 
Bum, chicks, they CUFFING 
Watch, they start SNITICHING, 
When cops, start CUFFING, 
HANDS 
I thought you was the MAN 
You a usual suspect, 
You ain't. No MAN, 
Catch me in the Soviet UNION, 
Just STALIN. 
Wit me KEN aka. My blood 
They gave me bread call it COMMUNION 
You thought I was gang, REPPING 
Stop, IT 
Ya flow 
I, Swat IT 
When, I'm all dressed. I'M on my Fly. Shit 
16 Spitting serious TOPICS, 
Hold UP 
Fake, niggas fold, UP 
When, niggas poker 
You, not a smoker 
But weed love to play with you, 
To muck, playing JOKER means out the deck for YOU, 
And your CREW, 
Smoking that moist grass in the morning 
I know that's what You DEW 
But When they stop YOU 
Please, don't ask what I DO 
Cause. These cops will give you the blues, 
My Dogg 
For, not having a CLUE, nigga, 
, 
Usual, Suspect, 
Usual, Suspect 
Your. Skin color makes you a suspect, 
Usual Suspect, 
Usual, Suspect. 
Let. Me know why am I a suspect, 
Because, I'm Black 
That's, not right 
If, I was white. 
I would be fighting for. What'S right, 
Uhh 
Usual, Suspect, 
Usual, Suspect, 
Your. Skin color makes you a suspect, 
Nigga 
 
Diging for gold thoughts on my mine, 
Bus flow 
Wishing. I had car, though 
If I did 
Speeding through life, 
Would be fine. 
With me 
And to the G, O 
V T 
Instead of helping a brother. They rather see M E 
Dead or stuck in poverty 
So. They tax me 
For. Every rhyme I spit 
For every dime a get 
But. They wonder why we so fucking violent 
They, don't understand 
The pain, we withstand as humans 
Believing in god, but the church full of nothing but corruption. 
Everyday you hear about Somebody dying, 
A kid crying 
Because. They not eating 
So their brothers. Slanging 
School is what they skipping 
Corners, where they hanging 
They became usual suspects. 
10 years later they in jail, 
Or, buried in the projects, 
 
Usual, Suspect, 
Usual, Suspect, 
Your. Skin color makes you a suspect, 
Usual Suspect, 
Usual, Suspect. 
Let. Me know why am I a suspect, 
Because, I'm Black 
That's, not right 
If, I was white. 
I would be fighting for. What'S right, 
Uhh 
Usual, Suspect, 
Usual, Suspect, 
Your. Skin color makes you a suspect, 
Nigga 
 
I'm, a great thinker like CONFUCIUS, 
Never trading on my homies. Unlike BRUTUS DID 
It's funny how he traded now he DEAD, 
I understand the man above 
But to be REALISTIC. 
His foe, understood me since I was a KID 
But. Ignorance is BLISS 
So. I am 
Wise as Martin, but Violent like Maclom 
Thinking
