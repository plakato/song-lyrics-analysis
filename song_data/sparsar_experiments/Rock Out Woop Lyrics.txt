Rock Out Woop Lyrics
by Woop.


Smoke a zip, roll another spliff.
Stack a chip, turn up on a nigga piffed up.
I'm the shit, diamonds on my wrist.
?
Want him dead, I don't know the man.
Get him out my face, I'm to fuckin piffed up.

What you mean, I'm Ameri-fiend.
I'm kill the scene man.
Hol' up, hol' up, hol'up.
Rock Out Woop.

Rock Out Woop.

Rock Out Woop.

I got a chopper that'll rock you out them motherfucking bands like a guitar.

Puerto Rican plug, Rican white flow.
Trap house keep a juug at the door.
Jack house got straight robbers in it.
Bit a skittle with a monkey in the middle.
I'm geeked up, what the fuck a nigga mean.
Rock out broad day, behind the team Billie Jean.
Crackers play it dirty, but I'm trying to keep it clean.
On the corner swangin' dope ?
I don't know what the fuck niggas is thinkin'.
I don't know nothing, Only thing that I'm saying.
Woopie ain't next?, you gotta be playin.

Selling swag packs of the Lingo.
Blow up, him C4, Moving with his bitch like a vevo.
I walk round' like I'm Deebo, I'm pluggd in with a chico.
Big dog status, that's me though.
Woopie got one feeling, my only feeling is fuck how you feeling.

Like em' classic, not that bullshit.
If she rock out, make me fall out, way she do it.
Rock out with my bitch say, Rock out with my niggas say.
I rock out in broad day, I bang out on Broadway.
And the gas growing like its doing push-ups.
I'm a hood nigga, doing hood shit.
If you a hood nigga, nigga throw your hood up.
Fuck where he from, we gon' rock out on him.
I take these bitches do mollies on em.
?
I got that lean in the styraphoam.
With my lil' nigga, he right or wrong.
Can't tell him nothing he keep that stone.
?, But you die alone.
So now, i-i just ride around with my full clip.
In case I have to rock out on some bullshit.
