A Shade Shady (Now Prance) Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Spoken.
Do you think you are fierce? How fierce are you? Come here. Show me.

Spoken - LaWanda Page.
Tell the man with the money to come here and pay me.

Shade.
Shady.
You are shady.
Shade.
Shady.
You are shady.

Now prance.
Prance, girl.
Now prance.
Prance I said!
Now prance.
Prance, girl.
Now prance.
Prance I said!

Spoken - LaWanda Page.
Just do it.

Don't be thrown' no shade.
I just want to get paid.

I just wanna get.
I just wanna get.
I just wanna get.
Paid.

Spoken - LaWanda Page.
Just do it.

You were lookin' at me.
I was lookin' at you.
You were lookin' at me.
I was looking at you too.
Shade.
Shade shade.

Tell the man with the money to come here and pay me.

Spoken - LaWanda Page.
Just do it.

Spoken - RuPaul.
Click, dial tone, goodbye, yes, on your merry way.
