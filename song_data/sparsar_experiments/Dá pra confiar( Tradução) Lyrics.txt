Dá pra confiar( Tradução) Lyrics
by Alkappa.

Artist: Alkappa.
Letter: Andrew lando kixindo.
Music: Does the trust to.
I am no longer understand nor see, but the fault is.
When I see children who blame the criminals to pay.
And corruption, but you stand to be the motto of educators.
Some patients die from lack of attention from doctors and others because it.
does not reside Doctor.
But guilt and from whom? My emperor himself says that the country is changing.
for the better, hey I respect the opinion of the Emperor.
But this country only this change for the worse.
Because here's the detector can see the fault of a poor sufferer.
Here the word love is only useful to win the consumer.
You do not feel and do not have the notion that the pain is not letting.
zungueiro kill the animal because his younger brother will take the tax money.
that is the fruit of their sweat.
I have no grudge but I have pain in my Emperor has no respect for people who.
are suffering.
The Angolan youth have time to drink but Duke gets the knowledge that the.
library offers.
More to blame is the emperor who said that youth and parents are growing.
And I wonder is it that only he can see the growth that we can not see.
Corruption in schools is increasing but that banks are creating.
The mentality of reppers here can only have quality when matter is consider.
crap.
50 Percent of rappers who are known as real mc under the supposed quality is.
less than a prostitute.
The future with this wrinkle buéd.
And the school has fewer kids because they are in the maternity ward to give.
birth to other kids and other.

But as the stranger can get what is ours in your pocket you our leaders are.
eyeing.
The Angolan police but the foreign Duke defends his people.
I do not know what the roads are new to rain napkin.
I do not know you but corn is the fault of the emperor himself who said that.
the country is changing for the better the agent said that the Angolan your.
best at your job for the boss does not do with little value.
And people have the pain of labor that he's your best.
Here you have the money when it tells you the love provides the tension you.
feel naked and care with which you feel.
But now I wonder who is to blame themselves oo your partner loves you but says.
that everything in this life.
Try to notice the ink from the pen of the artist's life without a poor life.
without hope.
The best youth no opinion.
The sungueiros but are afraid of the cops Duke of thieves.
The only result of the promises that were received in the beer and the highway.
poorly made but who is to blame.
I realize I'm not well.
The Angolan youth Duke is theoretical but practical.
True love is rare as the young scholars.
Here until the child asks you for the trust and believe in a man who says that.
Angola will change.
