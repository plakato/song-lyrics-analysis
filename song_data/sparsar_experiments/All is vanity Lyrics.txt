All is vanity Lyrics
by Twisted Artistics.


My man Deckdaddy's dropping them drums 
To hurt your abdominal ones, 
Word to your mums. 
Get your hands, out'your pockets or some' 
It'a, double the fun 
Twisted rhyme-pattern, properly done, 
Now get up and jump 
To. This blend-vibe
opposite from 
Cats talking as one 
Who recently stopped sucking his thumb. 
I'M talking to young 
Cats, all across the third rock from the sun, 
From scarlets to nuns 
To, you saints to you, prodigal sons, 
Pump it up in the trunk, 
Wether you're, wealthy or stuck in the slums 
Think, not that I'm one 
Of, those punks who's pockets'a run Out 
When profit is gone: 
From, black-jack and bottles of rum 
Due to my pops and my mums. 
I live life like the modest of monks, 
Bigging up all the ones 
Holding me down. When obstacles come 
Not up for no compromises, these knockers don't want 
Your free markets. Your cunning deceits, we oughta, cut out your tongues 
At. The top of your lungs 
Ruffnecks, set the riot off at these punks 
'till apocalypse and beyond 
There just ain't. No stopping this one 
 
Rocking it so opposite of all talk about automobils, 
And, other profitable topics that the market will 
Keep flashing'till apocalypse kills. 

All is vanity 
refuse to be falling in line 
It's sickening to see how kids be spit-licking to get a bit of shine. 
In stead of sticking to practicing hard and saying a better rhyme 
They got chicks up in their vids rubbing tits 
But. We stay on some other-ish 
Twisted Artistics and Deckdaddy-selecta 
Spinning that renegade-vibe to interact with the mainstream 
X-ray-beam to the game type to wake you up out of your daydream, 
What. I bargain my stardom to take part in 
Retarded guardian of the mic burn emcees to carbon 
All Clark Kent'till, I'm on that stage. 
Or I be chilling all night up in that Combat-cave 
With a stomach-ache from too much chocolate 
It's that paranoid gathering on hide out from the apocalypse
