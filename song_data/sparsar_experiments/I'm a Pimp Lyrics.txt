I'm a Pimp Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


I'm a pimp, I walk with a limp.
I step inside Papa Deauxxx, eating on shrimp.
I'm a baller, lane to lane crawler.
Clarion faller, candy roll hogger.
I'm a pimp, I walk with a limp.
I step inside Papa Deauxxx, eating on shrimp.
I'm a grinder, that's why I'm a shiner.
I left behind whiners, to be a big timer.

Lil Keke.
Here comes the Houston hustler man, it's time to get your game on.
Hit the block rolling hard, and get my swang on.
Pop the trunk marvalade, I don't play.
I ride 24's, later on that day.
I'm at Maxi, vale'd parked on Saturday night.
Sipping on muddy Sprite, looking for something tight.
On chrome, blowing the smoke off in my dome.
Banging and looking good, I'm jamming on Mike Jones.
Floss mode, I'm leaning and feeling thoed.
Choking and getting blowed, while I hold.
Man it's fa sho come on, and we killing the scene.
I'm a throwback gangsta, a underground king, yeah.

Mike Jones.
I'm growing like Rogain, took over your hoe mayn.
In seven months, Mike Jones took over the whole game.
See while you niggas at home trying to hate.
Y'all need to step up to the plate.
Cause I ain't about to feed y'all, I'm about lead y'all.
I bleed the block and stack a knot, when laws get hot I shake the spot.
I show the rocks and hoes bop, and they ain't even seen my drop yet.
Princess cuts, channel sets and baguettes on wrist and neck.
The mic I wreck, so now a lot of people show respect.
All plexers, my Lexus is done.
Keke, now the whole world wanna see me.
You see I grind to stay paid, no time for minimum wage.
A Escalade got it sprayed, cause we young made and paid.
I lay on white butter, my ice'll make you stutter.
I'm young local and gutter, but thoed as a motherfucker.
My album, Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon.
My album, Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon.

Paul Wall.
Look here, you can tell from the way that I dress.
BVS cover my chest, nothing less than the best.
Don't compare me to the rest, cause I'm one of a kind.
You can tell that I'm a baller, by the way I shine.
I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind.
So I hustle and grind, 99 percent of the time.
If you looking for a playa, I'm the best you'll find.
My conversation and punch lines, are one of a kind.
All drinks on me, when I'm at Cabo's.
It's playas get chose, so I'm surrounded by hoes.
When I'm in the parking lot, you know how that goes.
I got my trunk is out, to them my speakers exposed.
Lord knows that I'm a hustler, I was born to ball.
It's Paul Wall big swangas, when you see me crawl.
Nine inch frame, 24 inches tall.
Nan one of my diamonds got no flaw, holla at me baby.
