F.U.T.W. FREESTYLE Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.


Food, air, water.
Muse, heir, daughter.
No car for me/no pearl for my ol' girl.
I just told you what I need to start my own world.
So, I'mma fuck this one up; I'm tight, dude.
Four jobs just to live like a white dude?
Shit... Fuck out of here. Are you kidding?
Is working 4 jobs even living?
Don't even get me started on the government.
Keeping slavery alive and slaves loving it.
Eating organic pies and feeding us other shit.
Leaving my niggas hyped off Twinkies and fudgy shit.
Sweet porn to cook-up.
Read them labels; you're just eating wheat, corn, and sugar.
And that ain't even real. You ain't even worth that.
Them burgers fit for a king ain't even worth Jack.
So we run back to the water supply.
Cause we're sick of being mind-fucked scavengers.
But they made a back-up plan for my brothers to die.
If they ain't fucking us, they're fracking us.
Frustrated, you ask, can a brother breathe?!?
Just look to the sky, and tell me what you see.
Tell me what the story of the sky entails.
Is it a bird? No, it's a plane with chem-trails.
So, you see no one in your circle helping each other.
You even look up to the sky, to see no hope.
And once you learn, even your air is chemical, brother.
There's nothing left to do but dig your own hole.
