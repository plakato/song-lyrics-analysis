Guns For Life Lyrics
by Wu Block.

It's a little tale about my gun.
The Glock forty.
Trouble maker same time keep you alive.

Back then when the coke price was rock bottom.

I raised him up from 380's.
You call him your guns.
Ghostface killah.
You know it stay hot.
I can't live without him.
I call him my friends.
Cause my man had to murder something.

He said it's better when you're getting jumped.
Yo.
He hurt em like angela jolie with them babies.

Guess it all will depend yeah.
I still pour liquor after I pop bottles.
And this the only way I get back.
Now he twenty two thinking he's forty five.
Kiss him night night muah read him bedtime stories.
Styles P.
I told him chill.
Navy blue Glock in the blue safe right upstairs.
Now he with me.
And it ain't to often that he's not with me.

That's still my nigga though son.
Yall know what it is.
Times I just stared at him.
Pop it off or keep it tucked.
You feel me right ?
Got a friend named deuce nickel the cops got him.
Then I got knocked with him and the cops kept him.
He hung with puff he was with shine in club new york.
They're full of shit.
His belly stay full and he on a strict diet.
Got niggas deficating in shit bags.
Like to come with me everywhere when I drive.
Got a friend named nine.
I raised him up from 380's.
I robbed a lot of spots with him and im not lying.
I raised him up from 380's.
I made sure that little nigga stayed warm.
His ego too big he be getting pumped.

That's my homie.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I love my heat.
That nigga is live.
Homie named 38 he popped with me.

Since the day that I was born I ain't have safety.

I ain't seen him since.
A yo I kept the same gun for nine years.

You feel me ghost ?
Special relationship with that mother fucker.
I knew him ever since he was nine.
No matter how you face me.
UH.
Besides changing your diaper meaning your clip.
Go to sleep mr gat.
I reminisce and get high over a lot of weapons.
In case the robbers come I gotta perform.
He went from Y O to staten that's real talk.
WU BLOCK.
Sheik louch.
Yeah.
I had to do a double for two days.
That WU BLOCK shit nigga.
Feel the neck on that nigga.
Tucked him under my pillow.
Caught up in the murder one.
I feed him lead he good he at ease when fired.
No matter where you place me.
