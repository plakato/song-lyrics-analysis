Ain't On Nuttin' (K-Koke Remix) Lyrics
by Yungen.


Bam bam bam bam.
Fuck it, man will bus' if you test me, let's see.
Ever since a Yungen I've been gunnin' playing dirty.
No referee, you.
nerds ain't next, G.
It's a Koke wave and you can't take turns on my Jetski.
I check kings and take queens like a chess piece.
My erection is your girlfriend's bestie.
She said she wanna get messy like Chelsea.
I said she fucking with the best they can't sell me.
Healthy, living like a free man.
I beat every case and bounce back like a rebound.
I'm preeing this cake tryna desert and leave out.
These little snakes tryna do me like Eve now.
Apple crumble me and custardy, for like a week now.
Tryna fuck with me but luckily I got P's now.
Man ain't touching me, discussing me is like treason.
I come from underneath and turned a leaf like a tree does.
Disgusting little pricks, man are shitting on you, anal.
I'm Sky News, you got freeviews, cable.
Before I lose I will kill you, fatal.
I'm cocaine, let these brothers play Abel.
Cuh man have been through more shit than a toilet.
I was on the roads like A BT phone box.
Man walking machines like robots.
These man are talking the tings like Oprah.
I am like the feds' most wanted, I put ten toes on it.
If this skeng blows, promise man will end those comments.
No ifs, no bothers, no risk, no profit.
No show, can't stop it, you man ain't on it.

Yeah, you say you're all this, and all that.
But you ain't all that.
Said she take it from the back, man, that was all chat.
Yeah, she ain't on that.
My nigga, how you mean?
Nah, they ain't on nuttin', nah, they ain't on nuttin'.
My nigga, how you mean?
Nah, they ain't on nuttin', nah, they ain't on nuttin'.
