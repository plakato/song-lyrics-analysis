Shit's Gone Strange Lyrics
by Woodie.

Woodie.
As I'm 'bout to blow up.
Your knot and barrel fuck your brains.
I kinda take in a back.
And think about how things changed.
We used to be homies.
You flipped the script and now we rivals.
I hear you gettin' punked fuckin' with them outsidaz.
A ridah you?
Hell naw more like a bitch.
You's a non loyall backstabbing cowardly snitch.
My homies ? fighting 25 to life for doin' dirt.
So dont try to deny it sucka.
He's got you paper worked.
Should of kept you homies tight.
And played your cards right.
Instead you try to be that baller.
End up owin' your life.
And ain't no thang for me to rearange.
Your friends of L.A.
The Yoc ?? pretains.
So I maintain on the names.
And everything has gone strange.
But I'm still up in this shit.
Even though my gang's diminished.
To a five member click.
And Blackbird is gone.
But you never know how long.
That muthafucka might just creep up.
Leavin' two in your dome.
And it's on.

Blackbird is gone.
But the funk don't stop.
As I'm 'bout to blow up.
Your knot and barrel fuck your brains.
Blackbird is gone.
But the funk don't stop.
As I'm 'bout to blow up.
Your knot and barrel fuck your brains.
We used to be homies.
But you a rat infested rodent.
As I'm 'bout to blow up.
Your knot and barrel fuck your brains.
We used to be homies.
You flipped the script and now we rivals.

Lil' Los.
As my mind falls blind.
To a cloud of smoke.
Stroke chambers with my fingers and hope.
Dirty blood spills tonight.
Nine mills spit tight, hit right.
Make your fade.
When I set the flight.
Good night, I reen.
I mean not dreams.
When I let loose.
Induce 16 in your spleen.
And produce another murder scene.
My bullets fiend the teams of scream.
From an auto machine.
And put your ass to sleep, tweak.
When I creep, peep.
These sticky situations.
Conceration's what I'm facin'.
But there's no hesitations.
When I relieve frustrations.
The case is huh.
You bruised my pride.
But I refuse to loose.
So I'll choose to ride my side.
My folks no joke.
Leave you smoked, toked no doubt.
And I ? move that you choose.
???? single doubt.
Man there's lessons to be learned learned.
Tables to be turned turned.
Treason is the reason.

Scraps earn when our hollow tips drip.
From the clip bitch.
No shit, when my twist spits.
And wipe you off my hitlist.
And witness a bigness.
And homies that will witness.
At one time, but fuck why.
He'll switch up with quickness.
Your rediculous.
And giving Northern Cal a bad name.
Homies gonna get some grain.
Damn shit's gone strange.

Woodie.
Blackbird is gone.
But the funk don't stop.

Lil' Los.
Homies gonna get some grain.
Damn shit's gone strange.
