18 Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.

Luke &amp; Calum.
And I wish that I was eighteen to do all the things you read in a.
magazine.
I'm, I'm not saying I wanna be Charlie Sheen.
_She's just a little bit older but I want to get to know her.
She said it's already over_.

So tell me what else can I do?
I bought my fake ID for you.

She told me to meet her there.
I can't afford the bus fare.
I'm not old enough for her.
I'm just waiting ‘til I'm eighteen.

Calum &amp; _Michael_.
I think she wants to get with me, but she's got a job in the city.
Says that she's always too busy.
_She's got a naughty tattoo in a place that I want to get to.
But my mom still drives me to school_.

So tell me what else can I do?
I bought my fake ID for you.

She told me to meet her there.
I can't afford the bus fare.
I'm not old enough for her.
I'm just waiting ‘til I'm eighteen.
You got me waiting in a queue.
For a bar I can't get into.
I'm not old enough for you.
I'm just waiting ‘til I'm eighteen.

In my bedroom thinking of her.
Your pictures in my private folder.
I know one day that I will hold her.
I'll make my move when I get older, make my move when I get older.

She told me to meet her there.
I can't afford the bus fare.
I'm not old enough for her.
I'm just waiting ‘til I'm eighteen.
You got me waiting in a queue.
For a bar I can't get into.
I'm not old enough for you.
I'm just waiting ‘til I'm eighteen.

I'm so sick of waiting ‘til I'm eighteen.
