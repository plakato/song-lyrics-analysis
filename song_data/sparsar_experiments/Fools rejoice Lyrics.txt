Fools rejoice Lyrics
by Woodrowgerber.

Fools Rejoice: 
 
A king is angry. The fools rejoice 
I'm cast beneath by my greedy choice. 
Time will harden what heart remains: 
While armies, fight on open flames, 
 
I, had nothing to say: 
Then I'de fallen, oh so far, 
And I have lost my way. 
 
I see redemption but find none 
Beasts devour what men have done. 
My place revoked. I drift through time 
Waiting for two who bring the sign 
 
A thousand years. I wait outside 
Am I living or have I died, 
The king on thrown. I wait to hear 
A final judgement draw my fear
