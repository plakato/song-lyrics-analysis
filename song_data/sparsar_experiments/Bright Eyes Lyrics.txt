Bright Eyes Lyrics
by Vonnegutt.

She had the brightest eyes I'd ever seen.
She was all about herself, at least that's what it seemed.
I took it upon myself to go and intervene.
I think I've seen you before, no wait that was just in my dreams.
She laughed and said I bet you think you're really smooth.
And not to mention that you're pretty cute.
I took that as my cue and then i went and made my moves.
Next thing you know she's throwin' all her clothes up out the sunroof.
.
I think I'm in love.
.
At the hotel, it was all from there.
I must admit that we make quite the pair.
Between the scratches and the pulled hair.
See people busy playin' games and making truth a dare.
She handcuffed to the bed with chains.
She took out whips and all them freaky things.
Of course she left before morning came.
And come to think about it, i didn't even catch her name.
.
I think I'm in love.
.
Been down this road before, and I've been back again.
All this time before and now I've lost my track again.
What i should ignore has kept me back from when.
What it takes to get you here is what i'm askin' then.
.
I think I'm in love.
.
