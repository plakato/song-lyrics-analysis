You can call me A 
Some niggas call me Zig Zag 
These dude talk too much 
Im deadin. All the chit chat, 
Shorty like to smoke 
Well. I got that potion. 
Im tryna catch a wave 
And. I ain't near an ocean 
On to better thangs. 
I got a good feeling 
RIP to Etta James 
I'm, higher than this ceiling. 
Shorty sloppy, drunk 
Oh, so unappealing 
Sellin dope lines, 
Guess im drug dealin, 
They wan na see me fall 
Chill with the pipe dreams. 
Im a franchise boy 
Oh. I think they like me, 
Back in 06 
When we was rockin white tees, 
I, envisioned this 
The future. So frightening 
I fuck with bars heavy 
Screamin out fuck yall 
Like, an alcoholic 
Bitch im on a pub crawl, 
All them hoes staring 
Like, I'm In the class late 
Horribly driven 
Like a car with a MASS plate. 
Mothafuck, a hater 
Tell me how my ass taste 
In front of the peloton 
Yall up in last place. 
Rip Joe Paterno 
He passed from depression. 
I got one life to live, 
Never live it stressin, 
, 
CUTS TO 12-YEAR-OLD AZIZ, 
 
I know you zealous and eager 
Well. You are a lot 
Could shove you into an oven and you still wouldn't be hot 
I. Listen to some beats just to get in a groove 
I could sand you down dog. You still wouldn't be smooth. 
I thought your game really was nice for a minute. 
I. Could force feed you a foot and you still couldn't kick it 
Honestly? Look at you. You really think you can go past me 
Could, take a shit on your face and you still wouldn't be nasty.
