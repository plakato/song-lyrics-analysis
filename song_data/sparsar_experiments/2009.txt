You can call me A.
Some niggas call me Zig Zag.
These dude talk too much.
Im deadin all the chit chat.
Shorty like to smoke.
Well I got that potion.
Im tryna catch a wave.
And I ain't near an ocean.
On to better thangs.
I got a good feeling.
RIP to Etta James.
I'm higher than this ceiling.
Shorty sloppy drunk.
Oh so unappealing.
Sellin dope lines.
Guess im drug dealin.
They wanna see me fall.
Chill with the pipe dreams.
Im a franchise boy.
Oh I think they like me.
Back in 06.
When we was rockin white tees.
I envisioned this.
The future so frightening.
I fuck with bars heavy.
Screamin out fuck yall.
Like an alcoholic.
Bitch im on a pub crawl.
All them hoes staring.
Like I'm In the class late.
Horribly driven.
Like a car with a MASS plate.
Mothafuck a hater.
Tell me how my ass taste.
In front of the peloton.
Yall up in last place.
RIP Joe Paterno.
He passed from depression.
I got one life to live.
Never live it stressin.

CUTS TO 12-YEAR-OLD AZIZ.

I know you zealous and eager.
Well, you are a lot.
Could shove you into an oven and you still wouldn't be hot.
I listen to some beats, just to get in a groove.
I could sand you down dog you still wouldn't be smooth.
I thought your game really was nice for a minute.
I could force feed you a foot and you still couldn't kick it.
Honestly look at you, you really think you can go past me.
Could take a shit on your face and you still wouldn't be nasty.
