An Armstrong Ballard Lyrics
by 'Swich.

Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
I hate you.
The cat on the mat was flat.
He jumped off a roof and went splat.
Now Mason is dead he acted like a sped.
And we rejoiced forever after.

Roses are red.
Grass is green.
I like your legs.
And what's in between.

I like your style.
I like your class.
But most of all.
I like your ass.

Roses are red.
Grass is green.
You must weigh more.
Than a washing machine.

Roses are funny.
Violets are silly.
Watch out baby.
Here comes my Willy.

Violets are silly and.
Roses are funny.
You get no sex.
'Til I get some money.

Corpses are red.

And both are delightful.
When boiled for glue.

Roses are red, violets are blue.
I'm schizophrenic, and so am I.

Roses are red violets are blue.
If your parents said that you are beautiful they're lying you.

Roses are red. Violets are Blue.

That's the colour of your face, when I'm done with you.
