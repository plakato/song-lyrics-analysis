Headline Lyrics
by Two on the Road.


Uh-huh, KB's, yeah.

Armel.
Think you faster than a bullet, if you can, let him live.
If you can't, tell his kids, daddy need to exercise.
Couldn't let him slide, though, patience is a virtue.
Leave it up to Christ to hurt you, nah, I'd rather do it.
And I'll talk to him later, creation to creature.
You don't deserve your physical, death is one syllable.
Devil I consider you a waste of space.
So smart that you stupid final resting place.
I'm small, dark hole where your body turn cold.
And your spirit, start to wonder, and your family, start to ponder.
Where the hell is my son, I'm home cleaning a gun.
They ain't seen him in 80 days, until he reached front page.

12 O'Clock.
Sick time to shut it on 'em.
I bought 'em for my police officer granddaughter.
We feed 'em gun powder, put dust in they water.
I'm out in Florida, sniffing cocaine by the quarter.
I'm in the strip club in Mexico, next to the border.
Getting head from this pretty chick, sitting in the corner.
Where we looking real rich, so they pushing up on her.
Me and P burning kush, got them burners on us.
And it's cold outside, got them snorkels on us.
And it's Wu, muthafuckas, how the fuck do you want it?

The Reverend William Burk.
They say we no damn good, they say we too damn hood.
I say I'm misunderstood, come follow me if you would.
And step into the mind of a madman, with cash plans.
To stack grands, dirty dollars to pass hands.

Prodigal Sunn.
Yeah, I know you feeling us, the return of the Killa Beez.
Another trilogy, twisting up vanilla leaves.
I peel a hundred D's, we leaving with metal reefs.
Settle like some cheese, mellow off some green tea.
Deep as biology, ladies wanna follow me, swallow me.
Addicted to my lively psychology, P.
The ace in the pocket, I'm always on target.
You want it, I got it, fire like the fuel from a rocket, uncock it.
The lock and the key, many rocks in the sea.
But G-O-D be the Clan of the century.
A hundred grand for every man, we living it up.
Yo, cash in the cup, let the fans know what's up.
