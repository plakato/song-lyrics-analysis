Better Living Through Chemistry Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


The blue pill opens your eyes.
Is there a better way.
A new religion prescribed.
To those without the faith.
The hero holding a knife.
And blood is not enough.
Is it too late to go back?
Is it too late to go?

There's no one here.
And people everywhere, you're on your own.

Let's see if I'm hearing this right.
You suggest I should take.
A never-ending supply.
To carry out the day.
Your idols burn in the fire.
The mob comes crawling out.
I'm reclaiming my mind.
Destroying everyone.

There's no one here.
And people everywhere, you're all alone.
