Coming Out Of Hiding Lyrics
by RuPaul.

Writers: RuPaul/ Tom Trujillo.

I've been living in the shadows.
A dark and lonely place.
An empty room without a window.
No sun upon my face.

But I'm coming out.
Into the light of day.
Don't stand in my way.
I've made up my mind.
It's time for me to shine.
This moment is all mine.

I'm coming out of hiding.
I'm coming out of hiding -I'm coming out.

My time is now no time for tomorrow.
No more livin' in shame.
And if I have to beg, steal or borrow.
You will remember my name.

Yes, I'm movin on.
I've found respect for me.
I see my destiny there.
Yes, I will be strong.
Got someone lovin me.
And that someone is me!

No more hiding - light of day.
Not givin' up - can't keep me down.
Not givin in - I'm comin' out.
