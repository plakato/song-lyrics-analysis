Sorry Stanger Lyrics
by Sydney.

If I scream loud and up to the hills.
Will you come down in hopes that somehow I'll save the day.
You're wishing summer skies would fadeout.
You live your life like a black cloud.
You're wishing someone could see the rain.
Cause they could never really feel your pain.

We're just here to have a good time, let it all out.
But you're tripping on a bad line and does that make it right?

Oh you miss the fall and it's a matter of fact.
How I gave you pins and needles down the back of your neck.
And the nights we'd talk for hours are a thing of the past.
It's not the end of the world, it's not my fault that it turns.
Around and around again, so why don't you just give in.

Reconstruct all the pieces you left on the ground.
I'll still wait for the day and its coming now.
