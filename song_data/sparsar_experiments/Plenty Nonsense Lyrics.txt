Plenty Nonsense Lyrics
by YUNG ROC.

Yungroc - Plenty Nonsense.

Interlude.

E get plenty plenty things wey no suppose to happen for this life.
Plenty plenty things.
Plenty plenty nonsense.

After the rains come the sunshine.
But we don't even feel'em again not even the sunrise.
Awake to meet new black days everyday , amidst pain and anguish blood stains.
everyday.
From bombings to mourning.
The scores still running.
We no longer live like we used to.
Cuz we chose to kill our fellow brothers.
We are meant to protect too , not loving each other.
Like ah , we are living in the modern day slavery.
Humans are baked like a burning bread bakery.
Selfish interest scales more than the real gains.
How can we now settle for freedom while in these strong chains.
Would u blame it on me.
Or blame it on u.
Or blame it on the people outside u never knew.
Or blame it on the leaders who don't wanna show examples ?
Come out and say the truth and you will end up in dem bangles ...

Insecurity in this nation is like a broomstick.
Locked behind bars.
And water scooped with a chopstick.
Our voices are mellowed.
Talk and get killed , by some leaders in a hunting game well-skilled.
Lack of unity made our boundaries so porous so everything wey dey happen here.
dey make my heart bother me.
I represent the truth.
No murder me.
Oluwa's handmade impunity cover me.
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS , THEY WANNA GO HOME.
Let's get together , look for them.
I'm calling all zone.
God bless all those who are in for this fight.
Rest in peace to y'all who lost their lives on the bomb blasts ....

This Song is Written &amp; Dedicated to the victims of Book Haram Attacks ...
