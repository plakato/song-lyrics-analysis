Tic Tac (Nic Nac) Lyrics
by 415.

D-Loc 
Rich: what's up with these bitches coppin, these attitudes, man, 
 Richie, Rich 
Man? I don't know I had one of these stupid hoes, the other night man, 
 D-Loc 
Shoulda, slapped that bitch 
 Richie, Rich 
Talkin shit, 
I'ma talkin about real shit 
Cause. I got up out the cock and went to handle some business 
 D-Loc 
That's, what you'posed to do 
 Richie, Rich 
Well. I didn't really handle no business, though 
I went and fucked with another bitch 
 D-Loc 
Fuck that bitch you ain't got to be suckin up to no stupid-ass hoe, 
 Richie, Rich 
The hoe breath was stankin and everything 
I offered the hoe, a Tic Tac 
Matter. Of fact, the hoe name was Nic: Nac, ..., 
, 
, Richie, Rich 
You're, just mad cause. I left the room 
And since I didn't come back. You'Re actin, a fool 
Bitch. I had a knot, so I rushed up out the cock. 
What you thought was a knock. Was a hoe on jock 
So? I skipped and you don't know why 
Silly muthafucka, the cock was dry, 
I, kept pumpin and poundin, and all I saw 
Was 10 more minutes of this and my dick would be straight raw 
Nic Nac. Your breath needs a Tic Tac 
Fuckin with the Dubble-R. You needs to kick back, 
I made the 415 and Sniches
