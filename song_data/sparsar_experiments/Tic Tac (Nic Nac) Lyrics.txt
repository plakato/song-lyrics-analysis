Tic Tac (Nic Nac) Lyrics
by 415.

D-Loc.
Rich, what's up with these bitches coppin these attitudes, man?
Richie Rich.
Man, I don't know, I had one of these stupid hoes the other night, man.
D-Loc.
Shoulda slapped that bitch.
Richie Rich.
Talkin shit.
I'ma talkin about real shit.
Cause I got up out the cock and went to handle some business.
D-Loc.
That's what you 'posed to do.
Richie Rich.
Well, I didn't really handle no business though.
I went and fucked with another bitch.
D-Loc.
Fuck that bitch, you ain't got to be suckin up to no stupid-ass hoe.
Richie Rich.
The hoe breath was stankin and everything.
I offered the hoe a Tic Tac.
Matter of fact, the hoe name was Nic Nac....

Richie Rich.
You're just mad cause I left the room.
And since I didn't come back you're actin a fool.
Bitch, I had a knot, so I rushed up out the cock.
What you thought was a knock was a hoe on jock.
So I skipped and you don't know why.
Silly muthafucka, the cock was dry.
I kept pumpin and poundin, and all I saw.
Was 10 more minutes of this and my dick would be straight raw.
Nic Nac, your breath needs a Tic Tac.
Fuckin with the Dubble-R you needs to kick back.
I made the 415 and Sniches &amp; Biches.
And I be damned if a hoe will milk me for riches.
Just straight up dick is your option to lick.
Fuck ridin on the gold ones and material shit.
It's like this, baby girl, you better survive.
And quit talkin shit about the 415.
So take that, Miss Nic Nac.
You ain't held 415 back.
