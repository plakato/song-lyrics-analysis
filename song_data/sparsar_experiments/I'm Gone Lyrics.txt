I'm Gone Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.


Now I can't live without it.
You don't know how much I dream.
Now I can't about it.

Searching this matrix.
Sometimes it hurts to love it.
At times I love to hate it.
I know that you think I'm buggin'.

I'm not sure how it feels to have.
The whole world running up on your heels.
It's gets so lonely up at the top.
But I'm not complaining.
Even if I wanted to, I can never stop cause.

I'm gone.
I'm higher than you ever seen.
I'm gone.
Further than you could ever dream.

When it's said and done.
I finish second to none.
There's only room for one.
Wish I could catch myself.

Cause I'm.
I'm gone.
It's like I've left the stratosphere.
I'm gone.

No point of looking for me here.
When it's said and done.
I finish second to none.

There's only room for one.
Wish I could catch myself.
Cause I'm gone.

Cause luxury is my everyday reality.
But it's not all that it seems.
That's just not what's drivin me.

See, it's this music I bleed.
These lyrics I breath.
And the melody is such a part of me.
