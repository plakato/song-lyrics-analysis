Boom Get Chopped Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..

{Talking}.
I'm sick of it.
Me to.
Stop playin'.
This here is for the.
Tan shade man with the braid's.
Stop playin' with me.
I'm sick of it.
Fake punk wanna be.
Flip on this nine millmeter clip.

We come to stop him in his tracks, show him.
That I'm ruthless, Boom, Get Chopped!
We come to stop him in his track's.
Got to get my motherfuckin' name.
Boom Get Chopped!

Now you know this not some sunburst drink's.
I'm so deaf then the Def. Comedy Jam.
Open that clip, now clip up like I'm firm.
I'm a super duper rap rapper.
Steady makin' snappers.
Hand's clapper, nigga my chopper got'cha.
I'm on the first floor emergency.
Bury me, mister I'm sick, I'm jump for joy.
But quickly, in my disguise to finish the j-o-b.
Ya see, I'm back on track, can ya get with that?
No, you's a ho, you's a ho Mystikal!
I pack ya up like there's nothin' to be.
Down like a street, steady re-loadin' my weapon.
Like a brass knuckle, and my soldiers I mean shoes.
I mentally Retaliate, ya think ya slick.
You not gonna bounce, you not gonna bow.
Ho you on my dick, but umm.
I like the way you scream Yelllla!
Cuz, you be sweatin' so hard you need three or four towels.
I tried to shoot you in yo head, I wanted to see some.
Bloody bread, somebody in the crowd said.
Girl, that boy dead Fuck Him!
He was a cheerleader anyway.
You could never play it off ho, you was really gay.
Cuz you could break yo self but you can't break me.
Cuz I'm a real fuckin' lyricst with U.N.L.V.
With the flow umm, Flower, you know what.
From the floor up, with the dirt rapper.
I'm the dirty rap master, I'm comin' to Chop Ya!
With my knock you out style, that I practice.
Like gymnastics', I'm a fantastic static phonetic.
I'm out the attic, with the all black jacket.
Bringin' much racket, snatch ya faggot.
Worse then that standin' there I say.
Ho stop playin' with me!
Cuz.

We here stop him in his track's.
Show him that I'm ruthless.
Boom, Get Chopped!
We here to stop him in his track's.
Got to get my motherfuckin' name.
Boom Get Chopped!
{2x}.

{ Lil' Ya}.

How could bitches fuck with.
Million dollar nigga's how ya figure?
It's all good for you to stroll through my hood.
V.L. throw suspicious rock's at yo shit and.
If they had k's they spray and leave you.
Dead as a bitch! what type of nigga want's.
To walk around here in braid's.
What happened to the Chuck's, Levi's and the fad's.
Swish blade in my pocket, when I see ya I'm a cut yo hair.
No matter where, It's ugly you don't want to see.
The capital Y-A get into yo shit nigga dick sucker!
Whoa flippin' motherfucker Michael Jackson pretendin'.
You read for vision go suck a dick nigga.
Reach around the whole Third hit that ass.
Picture me and you in a two man cell.
You washin' nigga's draw's takin' my.
Dick leanin' on the wall now Mystikal you bitch you.
Remember when you said you wasn't gonna bow.
You disrespected the U.

Criminal minded you been defined.
As the fakest motherfucker in the Down South area.
I think your goin' through a phaze.
What made ya, turn around and talk shit.
Your rhymes and you personally doesn't fit.
Now wait a minute, remember that time.
You got on Soul Train.
You got the chance, and didn't even represent man.
You faked the funk, actin' like a straight punk.
Check it out, they thought you was like us.
The motherfucker siked up.
Turned around, had a fuckin' glitter glove.
Now, can you tell me what the nigga here.
Was thinkin' of?
I'm here to stop you in yo track's.
The shit you do, be wack I'm fat.
Shit's spittin' I done all ready stacked.
Tellin' me that the nation wide.
But you know, that I know.
You don't want the whole nation to know.
You's a Ho! fuck the piece treaty.
You started this, where's my all black clothes and.
My all black beanie, I play it Pinnately style.
Leavin' ya gutless, leavin' ya buttless.
We put together the bomb alarm.
Half this shit you can't touch this.
You best's to stick to jumpin' around.
Have the area first down, cuz I'm the hound and.
You the clown, now wipe the sweet from my neck.
Cuz you ain't nothin' but a bitch.
