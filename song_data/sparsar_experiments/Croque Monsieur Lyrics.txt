Croque Monsieur Lyrics
by Wordburglar.


Start the jam.
I'm bringing words together like an ampersand.
Wordburg!
'Bout to make your goddamn Pampers damp.
Slamming amps off the ramp.
Hitting the Tamtam.
Classier than your tramp-stamp aunt in a trans-am.
Call Bran Van.
This shit is 3000.
A habitat for humanity.
Free housing.
Help people move.
Thanks for giving a listening.
To everywhere you go.
Like pigeons in Islington.
Different.
Never tried or play it shock rappers.
Like seeing Vinnie Paz in a pride parade.
My time a day is every time a rhyme is sprayed.
And I'm good without the shine.
Like a diamond in the shade.
Whether your favorite Slaughterhouse.
Is ace or Ace or Kurt Vonnegut.
If you make a mix-tape.
Make sure you got a Burg song on it.
A hominid.
Who likes his PlayStation moddedded.
Style self taught.
And I let myself audit it.

Oh shit!
This ain't a ham-and-cheese.
Its Croque Monsieur.
Promoting dope, coast-to-coast.
Like a pot-sticker.
How could I not give her?
What am I, chopped liver?
Don't think it's hot?
I don't buy it, like a shoplifter.
Lyrical Croque Monsieur.
Making you plot thicker.
Promoting dope, coast-to-coast.
Like a pot-sticker.
How could I not give her?
What am I, chopped liver?
Don't think it's hot?
I don't buy it, like a shoplifter.

And I keep warming up.
Like someone had just bought me a sweater.
Cause good things take time.
Like a watch repossessor.
Never leave you hanging.
Count on your Burgy.
For more lines.
Than a sale at Burberry.
Subverting.
Can I get a five like Laurier.
Cause being boring is so cliche.
Oh, behave.
I stay on the mound like Halladay.
When I see an alien I say, “Salame!”.
From salad days.
To all you can eat luncheons.
Get attention like F-Bombs at family functions.
Curmudgeons.
Wondering:.
What the hell is he doing?
Who's your target demographic?
Humans.
Whether your consuming Macaroons.
Out in Saskatoon.
Or back in Hali.
Cracking brews in the afternoon.
If someone says.
That they're better than you.
They're just a fraud.
Like a vegan wearing leather at a zoo.
