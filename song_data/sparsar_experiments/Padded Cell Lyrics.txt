Padded Cell Lyrics
by Xander the Great.


You ddnt have to cut me deep x2.

I just need someone to open to x2.

How long did it take you.
To c the bright side of me.
I dont need your lungs.
I dont need your breath.
Im fighting this without u.
But....

You ddnt have to cut me deep x2.

I just need someone to open to x2.

You say i dnt even wana go.
Away.
From you.. I tried.
Cuz even if i stayed youd let me fall.
I know u more than u.

You ddnt have to cut me deep x2.

I just need someone to open to x2.

Now u want me yea?
Now u want me yea!

I can't believe this.
I was there like...
Wats the difference.
I do think of killing myself.
Its watever doctor....
