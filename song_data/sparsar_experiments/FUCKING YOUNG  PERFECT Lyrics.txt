FUCKING YOUNG  PERFECT Lyrics
by Tyler.

**Part**** 1 - FUCKING YOUNG**.

Day that I met you girl.
I knew that it was something special.
But I couldn't put my finger on it.
We met through mutual friends.
And this is where the story and confusion begin.
Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't.

There go the police man.
Do I leave out the back and.
Or do I answer real confused like.
Now me and she held hands.
She kissed my hand a couple times,.
There's nobody at the door, fuck, cause.

Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young.
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up.
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young.
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love.

A six year  is a ten year.
And with the  on my skin.
I don't want to be another.
You bring me.
And you fill a void that was once missing.
And.

There go the police man.
Do I leave out the back and.
Or do I answer real confused like.
Now me and she held hands.
She kissed my hand a couple times,.
There's nobody at the door,.
Fuck, cause.

Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young.
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up.
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young.
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love.

When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21.
Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8.
I'll probably run, cause I'm fucking terrified.
Yo this is dumb,you should find someone else.
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself.
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help.
Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help.
So when you mention hang, I'm thinking about a tree and a belt.
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation.
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-.
Span, it's gonna suck your shit, it's that kitchen fan.
It splattered on me like my dick in my hand.
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off.
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off.
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught.
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds.
But I found my wings, fuck,.
I really like you,.
Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this.
It won't even matter, I'll be in the clear,it's T and Uncle Charlie.

**Part 2 - PERFECT**.

Boy I know, that we could be more.
Than just friends, but you're scared.
Boy I know, that we could be more.
Than just friends, but you're scared.

I know that there could be.
Somethin' for you and me.
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared.
And I exit and wait a while.

See the answers are all there.

You and I are cut from different fabric.

Don't be too material to see.

This world is such a struggle just to be.
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me.

But you're too fuckin' young.
And girl I know that you're the one for me.
Fuck, cause you're too fuckin' young.
And girl I know that you're the one for me.
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts.
Cause you're too fuckin' young.
And girl I know that you're the one.
That you're the one, for me.
Cause you're too fuckin' young.
And girl I know that you're the one for me, yeah.

I rock.
I rock.
I rock.
