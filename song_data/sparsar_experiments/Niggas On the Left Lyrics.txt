Niggas On the Left Lyrics
by Zin-Zeta.

Lyrics: Clan in da front, let your feet stomp.
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death.
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night.
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to....

Ayo, hustlas, gangstas, bustas, wankstas.
Cornballs, warhols, all y'all, I thank ya.
For bumpin' Zetaphore Productions and Gravity.
The Cut-Man and Graphic, B, back when were practically beggin' whores to hump.
him.
We came a long way and now the metaphors are buzzin'.
I remember when my mutha-f*ckin' credit score was nothin'.
Now, we make enough dough to break bread with all our cousins... they never.
saw this comin'.
Who expected all this clubbin'. T.
He hunnies been lovin' me since they saw me on Baby Girl and heard me on.
Half A Dozen..
My lyrics got'em jumpin', so their jugs are jugglin'.
They huddle around me with their bubbles and let me touch'em.
Once they get a hold of me, I might bend them over -.
Have'em titties lookin' over-easy, and smash ovaries.

Ayo, snake-skin snap-back, cocked by the dome-piece.
Dime-piece givin' dome-piece till I fall 'sleep.
Wake up half-baked... breath-stench... Hennessy.
The brain was so good that the b*tch took my memory.
Everyday's a new day/new brain.
That means, my memory's gone temporarily.
B*tch I'm a dog - a brand-new pedigree. The type to hold it down... tits....
Gravity.
My dick's by her cavities.
I'm sick, like a room full of mutha-f*ckin' allergies - the illest nigga.
rappin', B.

Yeah... CUTTA!
Music make'em jam, but the gun don't, cause I keep the clip clean.
Bust a nigga's dome; turn his dream into a split-screen.
Young nigga, but I got big dreams.
I was better than niggas when I was sixteen.
Real rap, nigga. Check my f*ckin' resum√©.
I'm in the booth, cookin' up the soup; I got the recipe.
You can't box with the nigga; you're a featherweight.
Nigga's mad, cause I'm after Jay like the letter 'K'.
