Do That S*** Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.

Sick when she rock shit, stop when block shit.
Never try to run when she pull back the cock shit.
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop shit.
Got 'em goin' crazy, wonderin' when they could cop shit.
First lady, Ruff Ryder, honey got the hot shit.
Star-bound, money now, for jet-black drop shit.
Eve guarantee, betcha' niggas wanna pop this.
Little kids be behind me screamin' out, Can you stop Miss?
I know they daddy's fiendin', daydreamin' bout me topless.
Real bitches listen while they ride around and knock my shit.
Try not to move ya head, come on now, stop it.
Hustle nigga betty take yours quicker than coke profit.
'Cuz I can double it, and put.
Bitch on bitch, brick on brick, stich on stich, who you fuckin' wit?
Not me, can't a nigga or bitch stop me.
You hatin' mothafuckas line up for your first copy.
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, uhh.
Role it up and just lite some, uhh.
Where my niggas with the big guns?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, whoa, whoa.
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, uhh.
Role it up and just lite some, uhh.
Where my bitches that take ones?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, whoa, whoa.
Uh, yo start the beef, hold up, ran when we rolled up.
Tough guy, wanna try ya luck? Betcha' fold up.
Ask around partner, got this whole shit sewed up.
Gotcha' cryin' like, Man I wanna blow up.
Cowards make me sick, swear to god I wanna throw-up.
Answer in a session with me? You better flow tough.
Offended? Don't agree with what I'm sayin' nigga? So what?
Now I gotta teach you respect, you better slow up.
Question, 'Can she really hold it down?' Sure enough.
Philly's where she from, but when she smoke, she like to go Dutch.
You know what? Quick to take the next man Shyne.
Quick to make him start bitchin' make the next man whine.
Fuckin babies!! Go ahead and lay down, it's nap-time.
Same shit you spittin', heard it in your last rhyme.
Ain't to much thatchu' could do, so that'chure skills could pass mine.
Career fineto, here's some dough, go watch a peep show.
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, uhh.
Role it up and just lite some, uhh.
Where my niggas with the big guns?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, whoa, whoa.
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, uhh.
Role it up and just lite some, uhh.
Where my bitches that take ones?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, whoa, whoa.
What me to talk crazy, shit, my mom's made me.
And all ya'll niggas can do is spend a paybie.
Ain't gonna never change, do anything for bricks.
Call my celly to come get you while I pass you in your Range.
Nigga ride ya shotgun in the car wit' your friends.
And what the fuck you wanna do? But wanna blow out your brains?
Clown, I spot 'em from the time you buy me a drink.
Instantly I get a vision of diamond studded links.
And full ink minks, and little doggies dyed pink.
'Cuz I know ya wanna spend your last, before you even think.
If you know somethin', speak the shit, I can keep a secret.
To me, the niggas with the most money, is the cheapest.
Wanna give me money off the book? Daddy you can keep it.
That's why they got the most sites, and in the most fights.
And walk with big brolic niggas thats protectin' they life.
If you know you pussy nigga, take off the ice.
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, uhh.
Role it up and just lite some, uhh.
Where my niggas with the big guns?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, whoa, whoa.
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, uhh.
Role it up and just lite some, uhh.
Where my bitches that take ones?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, whoa, whoa.
