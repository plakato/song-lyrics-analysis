Flow Lyrics
by Quillz.

This would be one of my deepest flows ever/.
Questioning God why me cause never/.
Thought my life would turn out for the better/.
Dudes I use to look up to that was on higher levels/.
I stepped over &amp; kept it moving like bike paddles/.
Now rats stay chasing me cause I got cheddar/.
With diamonds that bright up different colors like fruity pebbles/.
Damn..I sit back &amp; I jus wonder/.
Swear that I never seen this here coming/.
Born partially unwanted &amp; given nothing/.
Blinded by my childhood.. Stevey Wonder/.
Is if I did something wrong..felt I was punished/.
Facing consequences before my repercussions/.
Fuck it..is how I felt mann swear I did/.
Witnessing adult shit just as a kid/.
Now I say it is what it is/.
Looking back I wish a nigga would tried saying that shit/.
Word on everything a nigga came from nothing/.
I'd never take a plea cause I'm not settling/.
Part of the reason I won't do relationships/.
Trust issues make it hard to go thru w//.
Falsely accusing my other half of cheating/.
Allowing gd ones to go because of my conscious/.
Females telling me I'm the best they every had/.
&amp; its sad cause I'm rolling stone like my dad/.
Same person I can't stand I'm just like/.
I hate it when family members say we look just alike/.
Taking his ugly treats plus he wasn't in my life/.
Things he should a taught me but I came out alright/.
Being abandoned took a toll me tho/.
Use to not having so I'm afraid of letting go/.
Like I'm holding for dare life but my feet on the floor/.
Life is a unsure question that we'll never know/.
But know I'm starting to live life to get my best answer/.
Yolo too bad we ain't giving multiple chances/.
Living to the fullest I don't take shit for granted/.
When its over its over ain't no use of ranting/.
I'm not afraid of dying but afraid of not trying/.
Hate not finishing what I haven't yet accomplished/.
Stuck on being a winner don't like the thought quitting/.
My own worst critic ion need ppl sayn what I isn't/.
Seeing where I'm at now a nigga turned out great/.
It took time but I'm okay w/ being late/.
Never late is better but better late than never/.
Life's courses made me out to be quite clever/.
Now I smile just to smile w/o a giving reason/.
Knowing God got me covered is pretty damn relieving/.
Ima keeping going till the day I stop breathing/.
Thats the only way I'll stop believing best believe it..Alive &amp; Living/.
