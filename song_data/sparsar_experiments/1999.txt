It's TwentyOne.
And umm, I'm bout to be 21.
If that counts.
Only Classics, forever.
Uh.
What you need? Bet I got it, or could get it.
I'm a pilot, navigating through this game to get up in it.
Who you tricking with that nonsense?
That, oh I'm the bomb shit.
That, oh, I'm the one, I just the LeBron of rap..
Nigga, I doubt it.
With those basic ass lines that you talking?
Them repetitive flows like your mind has no content.
Almost every one of y'all is ass like Eeyore in the first place.
Speak as if you grinding but you tweet more than you work.
Face facts.
I just call it like I see it.
I see it as a wonder other people never seen it.
You have no type of vision.
Better luck to see at night.
Niggas spitting like they just learned how to read and write.
Nigga, you nice, you nice.
You not, you not.
Regardless of your hype, who the fuck gave you the mic.
Who the fuck told you to rhyme?
Who the fuck told you to write?
Whoever told you to spit, whole opinion wasn't right.
You say Aziz ain't nice, well you prolly be correct.
Only got one shot like the ref called a tech.
So you can't live life being Mr. Nice Guy.
Tryna take my spot?
I could tell em nice try.
TwentyOne is on my mind.
Yeah.
TwentyOne is on my mind.

CUTS TO 12-YEAR-OLD AZIZ.

My name is Flow and I know how to rhyme.
You out of line if your rhymes try to compare to mine.
