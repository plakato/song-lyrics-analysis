What Do You Need Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


Hangin out the window on some other shit.
Tripping, looking like im on some gutta shit.
Momma, getting money from the government.
Habits, die hard got my brother pissed.
Youngin, everyday is like im growin up.
Stupid, if you thinking that you know enough.
Never, been a killa but ill throw somethin.
Little, so I always had to prove somethin.

I ain't trippin it ain't nothin.
Thought I told you we don't trust em.
I ain't trippin it ain't nothin.
Thought I told you we don't trust em.
What do you need.
What do you need.

Movin, Time to push it to the limit now.
Eating, Dinner towel on my button down.
Laughin, Talkin shit about some throw backs.
Plottin, Tryna make a nigga go back.
Simple, Lookin like a easy market now.
And my boys produce like a market now.
Seein, Everything start to come to surface.

Petty, I don't need you round my team nigga.
Greed, That the number one disease nigga.
Crazy, Well at least that's what my momma say.
Careful, Can't shit where I gotta lay.

I ain't trippin it ain't nothin.
Thought I told you we don't trust em.
I ain't trippin it ain't nothin.
Thought I told you we don't trust em.
What do you need.
What do you need.

Pay attention.
My shit been so official.
I make it so you get it gotta keep it hella simple.
So.
Play the role.
I know I'm faded tho.
My nigga designated so I know I'll make it home.
Gave a fuck.
I'm always shaded up.
You always actin hard and we know you made it up.
I'm bout my shit, I gotta bottom bitch.
And she done been my plug every time I'm tryna slip.
What the fuck.
I did some growin up.
I'm putting in the work it's time to do some blowin up.
Super slick, I lowkey swoop a bitch.
My city too small so I gotta plea the fifth.

I ain't trippin it ain't nothin.
Thought I told you we don't trust em.
I ain't trippin it ain't nothin.
Thought I told you we don't trust em.
What do you need.
What do you need.
