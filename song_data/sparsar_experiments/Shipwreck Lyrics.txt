Shipwreck Lyrics

All that fear in my heart.
And he said he wouldn't leave then he trapped me in a box.
Everywhere he went and he took me very far.
Maybe he forgot, Maybe he forgot.
But I gave him my heart.
And he said he wouldn't lose so he trapped it in a box.
Everywhere he went, he took very far.
Maybe he forgot, Maybe he forgot.

They say that love's a ship.
Only built for two.
Our hope can be the water.
Such depth when we were new.
These days it seems our ocean.
Is running dry and dry.
Even through ironic tears.
Our shipwreck showed we tried.

As time flies, does love die?
Or does it wait for the right time?
To reappear and make life clear.
These feelings adhere, fueling my tears for fears.
Present hallucinations of past love intoxications.
I'm addicted to your BlackMagic.
Your Love.

BlackMagic Feat. Aaliyah Allah.

That Voodoo.
BlackMagic Yeah.
That Voodoo that you do.
Fucked with my point of view.
And you know.
Your love is black magic.
Every outcome is tragic.
Even though we're nostalgic.
Your Lovecrimes are graphic.
And your love is so plastic, girl.

That Voodoo that you do.
Your voodoo is, that voodoo that you do.
Your voodoo is crucial, That voodoo is crucial.
Your voodoo is, that voodoo that you do.
Your voodoo is crucial, That voodoo is crucial.
That Voodoo.
