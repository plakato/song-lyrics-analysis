Black Bird Lyrics
by Swindle.


Don't be upset.
I love you.
My little black bird she thinks she's plain.
But have you heard the way she sings.
My little black bird.
Don't be a unnerved.
I want you.
My little black bird.
We want the same and I'm calling my name.
My little black bird.
Something like.
I think I'm cured from you.
My little black bird.
Not placing blame.
But I got to be free.
My little black bird.
Something like.
