Reactions Lyrics
by 3X Krazy.

Uh 
Mobb shit, 
Uh, uh, 
 
Hop in the Broham 
Cousin man we rollin, stolen 
Stay focused, go get the calico quick, we fearin, no man, 
The program, 
You juss, a dead man, walkin 
You all done witnessed The Sickness. It'S only of the chosen 
He said often 
That money would change. A fake nigga 
You can replace me an mace me 
But, can't erase me off the rictor 
Like hundred-percenter right through ya, set 
To settin standards like Tony 
Montana. Look at the picture: 
Go figure 
Mutha fuckas'll go juss like the Lotto 
Gustafos, an noreados 
I oops along an follow 
The not-knows 
When. The Glock goes through ya. Polo'S 

My Reactions like tuff actin', Tenactin wit, the Mac-10 
Makin sure my money stack in fractions. 
Juss follow my lead. An watch me mack. It 
Only way out of the situation is the savage 
 
When? Will they let'em G thee 
I feel the fresh air, but I dont feel free 
An. What I wouldn't give to live the way I thought life would be 
Mobb muzik. My only key 
Mass artilery prayers from mama 
Combined to grant the serpents soul to brace for drama 
They experienced the hardtimes, it all made sense. 
Then came the secrets of a gracious bitch 
My crooked ways won't straighten 
I'll chop. These dogs 
Wit a hand full of hustlas, but I'm on my own 
Reachin for prime real-estate on the banks of Rome 
One day ..., all my worries, they'll all be gone. 

Real niggas out to prevail, 
My guarantee 
Smokin bomb from dusk, til dawn. My simple wishes: 
Shreadin through the darkness of seekin, my fuckin riches, 
The wild west cuz it'll, make it wit out a vest 
Hard blows an hoes the test. Your last request, 
Decendents of vengance 
The out-done, can't run from repentance. 
My story won't: go untold 
The rocky roads, 
Hurt peers to the dirt to uncover gold 
Set up shop. You can't be stopped. Nigga start livin, 
You ain't gon soar wit the eagles, if you run wit, the pigeons 
Uh 
 
I'm, disconnected 
Theres no execeptions. I shoulda stayed in school 
Playin baseball up on the tube 
Instead of bein on the news. 
I see it all out. My Donna Karans 
Constantly drinkin thinkin FUCK MARRIGE 
I love this life I live 
Who gives a fuck if I die or live 
My only thing in this world is my kid: 
My baby mama full a pressure. 
I see our love, growin, lesser 
That's. Why I'm crumblin' herb up on my dresser 
Naked wit out my vest protecter 
Two in the morn kickin ya, doe down 
Its goin to the floor. Next to your four-pound 
Prepare, the Greyhound 
I'm in the hood wit, the homies 
All black wit, no mask Fuck. They saw me 
We throwin up that EASTSIDE worldwide 
An stay high, 
It's Murder,
