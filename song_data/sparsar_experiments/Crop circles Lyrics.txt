Crop circles Lyrics
by Visionaries.

Shaggy 2 Dope.
The sun rises and sets on time every day of the year.
But sporadically the circles appear.
Baffling all through the history of known man.
Since fuckin with the mystery of stone hedge.
Aliens, cults, witches with lawn mowers, mind blowers.
Nobody knows what for sure.
Bloody nose when I walk in the vicinity.
But I can read them and I believe that I need them.
I runnin through a wheat field, chasin a ghost that loves circles.
Use it for portals and time holes.
And dance backwards, and chant with the crow people.
At the crop circle, Ie come to know people.
Under moon rays lighten up my new ways.
They mow them in two days, 100 years from now wel pay for that mishap.
With another motherfucking hurricane bitch slapped.

The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.
The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.
Something solely meant just for me.
Circle something, circle something.
The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.

This ball of mud that we live on is alive.
You try to wipe its mouth, it gonna wipe us out.
I lay in a field alone in the middle of the night.
Try to get my life right, pray for bright lights.
Set flames to the wheat rows during an eclipse.
And the spirits will come out, dance, catch you a glimpse.
Intricately placed with secrets of white magic.
I running through the moon lit fields.
Following a little orb light hoping it might reveal any secret.
Its dancing, and I can catch up.
And I almost ran head first into a truck.
No compass will work, and I lookin for answers.
Why the sands of my hour glass fall off backwards.
Have I lost you, cause Ie lost me too.
But if youe hiding in the crops I will come find you.

The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.
The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.
Something solely meant just for me.
Circle something, circle something.
The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.

40,000 years ago, the stoning of a young man.
His story written in the crops near Spokane.
In England the face of a dead woman shown.
Etched out a wheat field uniquely woven.

Shaggy 2 Dope.
Hieroglyphics, mathematical genius, predicting the orbital patterns of Venus.
In the grass behind your grandpas wood barn.
Complex designs drops seconds before dawn.

Violent J.
Dead birds, scattered throughout the patterns of art.
No explanation left by the shadows of dark.
Batteries drained of they power in seconds.
I layin in the crop circle countin my blessings.

Shaggy 2 Dope.
And my heart, tho, headaches, and nausea were creeping.
And your nose will bleed while youe sleepin.

Violent J.
Don go near there, don dare, be ware.
Unless your like us, and don care.

The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.
The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.
Something solely meant just for me.
Circle something, circle something.
The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.

The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.
The crop circles are talking to me.
Circle something, circle something.
Something solely meant just for me.
Circle something, circle something.
The crop circles are talking to me.
