WBS (WaterBottleSippin') Lyrics
by Yung Dori.

Man i'm water bottle sippin'.
Blinded wandering no vision.
If you wanna come at me, boy i'll just think that you're kidding.
Find me cruising, stalking women.
My Aloe Vera stay hidden.
Speak 6 different languages.
Filling scripts is just my mission.

Sippin' on the syrup like a maniac.
So why don't you stay a while let's smoke this blunt.
And see how I react.

Kush in my new Pontiac.
No weed then i'm insomniac.
Addicted to getting high.
Thirty bitches they hit my line.
Popping pills and they asking why.
Asking her for her slice of pie.
Say I have to fucking earn it aye?
I eat her pussy she deserve it.
Colorado in the building.
If you see me then i'm killin'.
Know i'm straight up out the east boy, I eat boy.
