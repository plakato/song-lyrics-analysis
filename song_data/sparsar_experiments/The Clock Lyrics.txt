The Clock Lyrics
by 6th Sense.


Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Yeah, Yeah, Uh.
Time's a wastin'.
I tried to design the patience.
Instead I could define the places.
Way up on another level.
I coulda tried the basics.
I never could refine the faceless, about face.
I vanish without a trace.
I'm roamin' without a place.
To lay my head, and call my own.
So I'mma call the phone and get the case blown.
Tick tock, I don't stop the second hand.
This shit rocks, hip hop I recommend.
And then again, acetamin but what am I?
Another guy, that couldn't go wit' a butterfly.
Another why, the who what, the where now.
Prepare now, or give em another stare down.
One time that you get to lose.
When the alarm rings and you set to snooze.
I could be in the whip and forget to cruise.
Give you another tip, you forget the clues.
And I bet its true, that I'm stressin you.
I'mma let you through, and it's best to do.
So catch the view, then stretch a few.
A collectible, for the professional.
And the rest is cool, but I figured it out.
They could use the tool, but I'm diggin it out.
Of the holder ??, and the time times runnin' out.
And the time times runnin' out.

Thom Yorke.
Time is runnin' out, for us.
But you just move the hands upon the clock.

6th Sense.
So I'm on the prowl, lookin' for somethin to gain.
And I'm stuffin' the lane, thinkin of crushin the lames.
But I'm on the clock, am I crushin the top.
I got me a quarter, I got me a dime.
And I got me a time.

Thom Yorke.
You throw coins in a wishing well.
Wake up.
You just move your hands upon the clock.

It's sorta like we de-evolvin, we ain't the species.
With no time, but I paint the theses.
Front to end, even side to side.
I can provide the rhyme, and never tried the lime.
That I put on the edge of the glass.
Never lettin it past.
Forgettin to ask, am I regrettin the past?
It's only one future, only one sun.
Only one shooter, only one gun.
Just one target, hit one shot.
We just done started, we ain't gon' stop.
And I got the fellas, no we ain't rockafellas.
But they got to sell us, cuz we'll make em money.
This is my life that I'm livin right.
You can never take it from me.
You stress the dough, I'mma stress the soul.
With each and every breath I hold.
Is the breath control.
That is finna get you open.
Copin' with the facts, that'll get you strokin'.
And tokin', and get the plaques.
From ocean to ocean, to get the tracks.
The quotient of potions to get them back.
And never am I comin' down.
It's 6th Sense, CEO and Notherground.
That was another round, you get another round.

Thom Yorke.
It comes to you begging you to stop.
Wake up.
But you just move your hands upon the clock.
Throw coins in a wishing well for us.
You make believe that you are still in charge.

6th Sense.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I say.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I say.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
I said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
And I've said.
Time and time again.
I try to rewind and design a end.
