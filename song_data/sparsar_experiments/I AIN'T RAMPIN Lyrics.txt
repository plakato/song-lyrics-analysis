I AIN'T RAMPIN Lyrics
by Wonder.


It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.
It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.

It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.
It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.

I don't wanna party, I came just for cake.
Never watch face cos their smiles are all fake'n.
Fuck all them pussies from back in the day.
I've seen niggas get wetted from a champagne spray.

I'm in my zone, I'm on my wave.
Darq E brought the loud feel like a satellite in space.
I just spent a bill I hope I make it back today.
And flip it 10 more ways or we'll be running up in your house Where you lay.

It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.
It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.

It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.
It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.

You know how it is, you know how it goes.
Never paid the full price always got it for the low'n.
If you got bumped for a benz or a O.
I was immature then so you gotta let it go.

She was with me from the ford so I never cuffed hoe.
We're just tryna blow without moving any snow.
Tryna lick a milli so we make it off the roads.
Or die trying put it on my soul.

It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.
It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.

It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.
It's Game Over, It's Game Over.
It's Game Over, Game Over, Game Over.
