New Jack Swing Lyrics
by Wreckx-N-Effect.

Yo Wreckx-N-Effect.
In full effect!

It's the New Jack Swing.
Was it something wrong that she can clean?
All you gotta do is c'mon and sing.
Word for word, all the lyrics that I bring.
And if you feel the swing in your body.
When you step in cool inside a party.
Watching all the girls just bumping like hotties.
They have humps that's better than Ferrari's.
So I gotta try these.
Dancing with a girl on my lap.
I was chancing, hoping she was the type for romancing.
But my rap needed a little enhancing.
Because this girl needed some answering.
Nothing I said, I started to complain and turning red.
Then I told her just to be about Ted.
She gave a wink.
But can't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing.

Can't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing.

1-2-3 I named it New Jack Swing.
Yes, T.R., is my name.
Making you girls, do my thing.
It's the way, I entertain, baby.
I'm on the beat you like.
Yes, that's right, it's outta sight.
All the bumps are very high.
Yes, T.R. is grooving it right.
I got Keith Sweat, Heavy D.
To-day, Mo Dee.
B. Sure, and my man Bobby Brown.
I got Cinnamon, Redhead.
Boy George, James.
Deejay, and my hooome-booooys Guy.

Can't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing.

Back to the matter, The New Jack Swing.
It's the sound that can flatter.
Even if the sound around town doesn't give a.
Same type of feeling that this one delivers.
So your body shivers.
So bad, so dope big metal thing you wish you had.
Bumping your feeling from glad to sad.
But your not getting offensive.
Just chill and get whipped by the New Jack Swing.

Can't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing.
