Use Your Heart Lyrics
by SWV.


Alone.
You and I intertwine.
Refreshing conversation for the mind.

As we stare.
We both seek and hope to find.
Real love purified.

Use your heart.
And not your eyes.
Baby, just relax and ride.

If you got time.
Then I got time, yeah, yeah.
Free your thoughts and watch them fly.
Use your heart.
And not your eyes.

I sigh as I watch you sleeping there.
So easily I did things.
I'd never dare.

I say to myself.
I'm glad that we share.
Real love purified, oh.

My goodness.
How it seems like yesterday.
She crossed you hurt you in the strongest way.

You hurt so long.
Reward come to those who cry.
Real love purified.

Just a second.
I look at my watch's dial.
And you love me helping me like a child.

As we lay.
I close my eyes.
And I smile.
At your real love purified.

Use your heart and not your eyes.

If you got time.
Then I got time.
Free your thoughts and watch them fly.
Use your heart.
And not your eyes.

Use your heart.
And not your eyes.

If you got time.
Then I got time.
Free your thoughts.
And watch them fly.
