Corsicana Clip Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

Riding you down.
Up the backstairs.
Skip alive, walking wounded man.
As big as your fist.
Who gave you such a heart.
Such a heart as this.
Spread out on the ground.
Corsicana clip.
'course it never slips.
All around yours lips.
The spool has spun, unwound.
In the hollow of His hand.
Delicate listener.
My tendered giver.
My bodied lampstand.
Oh I must be off, off your rock.
I set my teeth in a spite of hand.
I've got a chalk-man's chance.
To bet him down.
To stop his clock.
Be a problem to me.
Quiet, like a feather.
Seven hundred pound horn.
And buck rein tight.
Just as dangerous.
With my free hand tonight.
From a clang of iron.
All drawn out, all such animals do sound.
The ballroom belle found.
Stove him and cut him down.
From the hollow of His hand.
Delicate listener.
My tendered giver.
Mercy's in the Man.
In the hollow of Your hand.
Untethered giver.
My bodied lamp-light stand.
I give up.
The looking through.
I leave up.
The . . . window.
. . ..
It is already near.
He has . . ..
Hey, cold shoulder.
Hey . ..
Whisper in my ear.
. . ..
Hey cold shoulder.
High above the praises of the people.
High above the praises of the people.
Unapproachable light!
Unapproachable light!
Come here!
Come here!
