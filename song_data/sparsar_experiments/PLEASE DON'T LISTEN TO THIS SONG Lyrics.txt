PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THIS SONG Lyrics
by Wonda.


Thought I Told You Not To Play This....

Rah Rah.
Rah Rah.

You Don't Listen Do Ya?

OooYeah.

Worked up.
Pretty girls getting on my nerves I'm nervous.
She talkin' bout diamonds in the cross that's the type of shit she worship.
OooYeah.
Hey can I give it to ya.
She saw diamonds in my Jesus.
Then she screamed out Hallelujah.

Amen.

Woke up feeling like the man, Awesome.
Riding through my city like I'm taking on Gotham.
But where are all the bad guys, man I think I lost ‘em.
All I see is bad girls....
What's wrong wit that?  Nothing.
But I don't want love.
Cuz I can't afford it.
Threw up the roc.
Jus' because I'm nauseous.
You seen that body?
That shit is Gorgeous.
They said please be cautious.
I said FUCK THAT CALL MY LAWYERS.

I'm the man.

Naw you don't understand.

Oh yea we in the house.

So I need you right now.

Cuz Baby I'm the man.
Suicide Doors You Can Fly or Drive.
All I'm Looking For Is A Ride or Die.
Hey Baby Over There Yo Am I Your Type?
Cuz All The Girls Say I'm Pretty Fly For A Black Guy.

When the liquor hits the system.
Ain't no for seein'.
Who I'ma be in.
Who feeling freaky.
She maybe Black, White, or half European.
If ya don't like that, did I ask your opinion?
I'm stupid stupid, I'm swerving crazy.
Jus' give it up, I deserve it baby.
I got Vitamin D, yea ya heard me baby.
Oh you say you been a bit malnourished lately.

Well-Well.
Well I'm the man.
Naw you don't understand.
Ay all my Players in the house.
So I need you right now.
Cuz Baby I'm the man.

Suicide Doors You Can Fly or Drive.
All I'm Looking For Is A Ride or Die.
Hey Baby Over There Yo Am I Your Type?
Cuz All The Girls Say I'm Pretty Fly For A Black Guy.

As soon as this came on the girls started going off.
But if you ain't show it all then you ain't showing off.
I need you real bad like my dick going soft.
PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THIS SONG.
Cuz this ain't what you want.

I'm the man.

Naw you don't understand.

Ay didn't I say we in the house.

Okay then I need you right now.

Break it.
Break it.
DOWN.
