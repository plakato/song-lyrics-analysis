All in Together Lyrics
by Wu Block.

Me I got killers, no blinking, just coke on their nostrils.
You used to play gun defence, now you're fly.

Scary niggas shoot with their eyes closed.

I shoot it up till the property value drop.
Stress me, you ain't convincing.
And little be the same blood, you can't....
When it's on nigga, I don't care how you rock.
Six feet deep where my gun's at.
Make it where this mother fucker, they don't come back!
Chasing at the club, throwing cheers at ‘em.

…I ain't talking about cascos.
Bitches just throwing benz at ‘em.
All you're giving now.
snitching.
Keep that thing making now bouncing about the club.
Enough... Better send the word to the monkeys.
Soon as you catch a couple hoes, use a man of faith.

Every day you never gave a fuck about a fuck boy anyway.
Come from the spot, with them niggas to get you…
Make it where this mother fucker, they don't come back!

Who want ladies is living now.
Keep that thing making now bouncing about the club.
If you ain't with us, you consider this hostile.
Snitching, you know how many mother fuckers got the head blown down for.
Keep that thing making now bouncing about the club.
Yeah, life's a bitch, so I'm fucking up.
Make it where this mother fucker, they don't come back!
Make it where this mother fucker wear a big hat!
Make it where this mother fucker, they don't come back!
Make it where this mother fucker wear a big hat!
As soon as he sitting the passenger seat, strangulate them!
Morals, principles, should I ball you out?
Who want ladies is living now.
All you're giving now.
Doctor bills don't play, they spend it.

Head guns, govern the issue, we still banging them.
Shout in, jump off the stairs at ‘em.
Make it where this mother fucker wear a big hat!
I've been riding dirty way before… and said it.
This is… little dudes… cop.
Who want ladies is living now.
Make it where this mother fucker wear a big hat!
Keep that thing making now bouncing about the club.
My gun heavy way, you was banned away.

All you're giving now.
…like me in a third world country.

Make it where this mother fucker don't come back.
And this to be the same club, you can't…
Who want ladies is living now.
Whatever you can bet it, where your gun is on, let it.
All you're giving now.
