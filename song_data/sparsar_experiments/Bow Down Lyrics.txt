Bow Down Lyrics
by Swoope.


How can I escape?
How can I escape you?
I feel like the prey, but who should I pray to?
Trapped inside my mind with really no where to escape to.
But my thoughts are being made in his image everyday.
I tell that voice to....

It's so much weighing on my brain.
Trying to keep these thoughts on track I almost lost the train.
My thoughts are low down dirty shame.
It's so much Wayans on my brain.
Major pain can't explain how I'm.
chilling one minute in my state of mind.
Later chained to a heinous cage.
Feeling like a prisoner can't escape, nah nah.
Swoope starts feeling like two shots, rah rah.
Or the two cops 2Pac shot, rah rah.
All on my mind like non stop and I'm like....

Tragic Hero &amp; Swoope.
How can I escape? How can I escape you?
I feel like the prey, but who should I pray to?
Trapped inside my mind with really no where to escape to.
But my thoughts are being made in his image everyday so.
I tell that voice to bow down.
Uh, it told me and I tell it right back, bow down.
Uh, control me I ain't having none of that, bow down.
Uh, how you gon rule in the mind of a king?
Bow down.
I almost lost my mind my G, bow down.
Till I put on the mind of Jesus, bow down.
I almost lost my mind my G, bow down.
Till I put on the mind of Jesus.
'Till I put on the mind of Jesus, bow down.

I can't lie sometimes I want the money.
A hunnid, hunnid thousand people screaming for me.
But hold up, hold up, hold up dog I need a minute.
Clear my thoughts bring to my memory, Jesus is sufficient!
Watch my thoughts, they become my actions.
Then my actions, they become my habits.
Then my habits, they become my nature.
And I'm looking in the mirror at a total stranger.
Danger, Danger.
I gotta capture the crap under my cap and take them captive.
Make a casket, they about to obey the captain, make them things slaves to my.
faithful master.
