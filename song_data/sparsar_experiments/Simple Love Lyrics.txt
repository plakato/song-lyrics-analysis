Simple Love Lyrics
by X.E.X.


You're a ghost now.
Heating up her bed.
She's been eating more pain.
Than she's been eating you.

And her heart don't beat for you.
It only beats for life.
And now your superpowers gone.
And all your love is gone.

All She need is that.
Simple love.
The simple way.
Just a simple touch.
Just the simple way.
Don't do so much.
Just be her drug.
With that simple Love , The simple way.

You're a mess now.
You can't clean up the pain.
Shes by your side.
But you're still alone.
And you fuck her right.
But that's just in your mind.
Cuz shes not really there.
Even though she's there.

You used to be her one drug.
Just feed her trust, don't give up.
Just wear that love like a glove, like a glove.
