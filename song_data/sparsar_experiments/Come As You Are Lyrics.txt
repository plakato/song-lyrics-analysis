Come As You Are Lyrics
by Yuna.

Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be.
As a friend, as a friend, as an old Enemy.
Take your time, hurry up, choice is yours, don't be late.
Take a rest, as a friend, as an old memory.

Memory ah, Memory ah, Memory ah.

Come doused in Mud, soaked in Bleach, as I want you to be.
As a trend, as a friend, as an old Memory ahhh.

Memory ahh, Memory ahh, Memory ahh.

And I swear that I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.

\--Instrumental--.

Memory ahh, Memory ahh, Memory ahh, Memory ahh..

And I swear that I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
