Day By Day Lyrics
by The Virus.

Looking back to the time that has passed.
I remember when punk was a blast.
When friends stuck together and things felt new.
But now I just don't know what to do.
So afraid of growing old.
I don't want to become part of the mold.
I don't want the times to change or me.

Year by year - day by day.
Time just seems to pass away.

Bring the war back to the streets.
Keep the spirit of punk in you.
And in your heart remain the same.
Keep the faith alive in you.

Year by year - day by day.
Time just seems to pass away.

So afraid I've got to be strong.
I just hope we can get along.
Maybe tomorrow we'll have a change.
Then maybe tomorrow won't be the same.
Friends are the only thing you got.
So keep then true and screw the lot.
I don't want the times to change for me.

Year by year - day by day.
Time just seems to pass away.
