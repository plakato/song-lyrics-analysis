Purely By Coincidence Lyrics
by Sweet Sensation.

Hey you, purely by coincidence.
Happen to be the one that I love.
And you, purely by coincidence.
Happen to be the hand to my glove.

Just a kid in rags when I first met you.
Everything and nothing to me.
So I set my heart to get you.
Closer than the arms I wrapped around you.
Safer than the sun.
Open up your heart for me.
It's time our love begun.

Hey you, purely by coincidence.
Happen to be the one that I love.
And you, purely by coincidence.
Happen to be the hand to my glove.

Would I wait for you forever, try me.
Only once I wanna hear you sayin' fly me.
Higher than the clouds that you see.
Faster than the wind.
Take my hand, take my heart.
An' let the lovin' in.

Hey you, purely by coincidence.
Happen to be the one that I love.
And you, purely by coincidence.
Happen to be the hand to my glove.

I was such an all-time loser.
Never tried to make it all come true, yeh, yeh, yeh.
But I won't stay an all-time loser.
If I find my winning streak with you.
You're the princess in my story.
I'm your king.
Like they say in all the love songs.
You're my everything.

Hey you, purely by coincidence.
Happen to be the one that I love.
And you, purely by coincidence.
Happen to be the hand to my glove.
