Intro - year 3000 style Lyrics
by Rusko.

I think when it comes to music and everything the man has to experiment 
Music to me, ... you see, most music is creative music 
You understand. That means its original. It comes from the heart 
So. What ever is in your heart, and you feel that you want to create a
different sound, you create that different, sound 
So. Who is anybody to say, there's any boundaries, You understand, 
Cause. If you check it out, you check out all the man them like King and
them and them what were they doing? They were pushing boundaries. 
You see at the time when that kinda music was out, it was kinda on a
different vibe 
They pushed the boundaries And made different, sounds and experimented with
sounds and echo reverb and all them kinda somethings.. So what we're doing is
the same thing, 
We're, taking it from that school and biggin' it up even to a different
dimension. That is why Year 3000 Style. Because you're creating something
different 
You're coming from the foundation thats, where you grew up in that school 
And, then from there thats. The foundation you start biggin' on top of that 
That's, what its about thats, what music is about
