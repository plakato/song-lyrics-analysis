Deadlines Lyrics
by Sydney.

We drive due south with bloodshot eyes, we live a broken lines.
Rest stops and the perfect scenes, long drives where I never get to sleep.
Sometimes I think I'm falling apart but I, I'm leaving tomorrow, I'm leaving.
tomorrow.
Rest stops and the perfect scenes.
The strain of my eyes just caught on to the weight of this evening.

Do you wanna make this harder?
Do you wanna share it by the fire?
I know you won't do it again, we've got to face the end.
Do you wanna make this harder?
Do you wanna share it by the fire?
I know you won't do it again, we've got to face the end.

I've been from coast to coast and I live for the next hundred miles.
Breath in the world in changing.
Let go, oh what they're saying.
They don't love you , They'll push you until you just fade.
So I'll send it express cause I know that you want it.
Use a ten dollar bill at the bottom of my pocket.
Thought the world would make us miss.
Instead it ended our whole relationship oh sweetie.

The strain of my eyes just caught onto the weight of this evening.
These nights left me with the simple satisfaction.
But the dreams I had were the ones that were bound to happen.

Do you wanna make this harder?
Do you wanna share it by the fire?
I know I won't do it again, we've got to face the end.
Do you wanna make this harder?
Do you wanna share it by the fire?
I know I won't do it again, we've got to face the end.

Oh no, don't you let it go to your head.
These simple words I thought you said.
Lets start this over, I wanna try for one more time tonight x2.

Do you wanna make this harder?
Do you wanna share it by the fire?
I know I won't do it again, we've got to face the end.
Do you wanna make this harder?
Do you wanna share it by the fire?
I know I won't do it again, we've got to face the end.

We've got to face the end x4.
