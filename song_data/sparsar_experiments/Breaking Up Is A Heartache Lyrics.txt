Breaking Up Is A Heartache Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Summer days ya play to find a home.
It's no use to trying to be clever.
No no never.
We all have dreams of never being apart.
We thought that we could stay together.
Forever.

Breaking up is a heartache.
Keeping up is a fool's game.
Breaking up is a heart ache.
Can't you see?

Confusing me.
Will you go or will you stay.
A voice inside tells me.
You're on your way.

Breaking up can be hard.
Don't you know?
I thought that love would keep us together.
Forever.

Breaking up is a heartache.
Keeping up is a fool's game.
Breaking up is a heartache.
Can't you see?

Breaking up is a heartache.
Keeping up is a fool's game.
Breaking up is a heartache for me.

Breaking up is a heartache.
Keeping up is a fool's game.
Breaking up is a heartache for me.
