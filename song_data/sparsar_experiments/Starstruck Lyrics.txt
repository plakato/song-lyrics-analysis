Starstruck Lyrics
by Volumes.

I got used to you.
I get star-struck when you re in the room.
I got used to you Gwen.
Well I got used to this.
Feeling that you always gave me.
I keep pushing forward.
Never looking back.
We start to realize.
The challenges of life.
I keep pushing forward.
I'll never live this down.
You won t see me tomorrow.
On your mouth is.
Where I d imagine my name.
We've got this fresh start.
You re leaving bound tomorrow.
Last weekend at the lake.
You're all I thought about.
No I can't get away.
Because you re so addicting.
I can't get away.
Cause baby you re addicting.
Well look who runs this town now.
You try and push me further.
Welcome to this two way street.
You know you are not welcome here.
Spit n shine my badge clean.
I got used to you.
And now this feelings gone away.
You make me want to destroy everything beautiful that comes my way.
But I got used to you.
I get star-struck when you re in the room.
I got used to Gwen.
Well I got used to this.
Feeling that you always gave me.
We re living our lives.
Swear we know who we are.
If it's growing up.
I guess we'll hold on, hold on.
Just watch me run.
Through the crosshairs of your gun.
Widen that lens.
Your hand is steady.
Are you trigger-happy now?
Watch me run.
Through the crosshairs of your gun.
I'm so sick of this shit.
Walking up my pathway.
That's when I knew.
I got used to you.
You re starting a war within.
I feel you crawling.
Underneath my skin.
