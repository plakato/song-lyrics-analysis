Now I Can Feel It Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Now I Can Feel It.

Two years I held my breath under that water's edge.
Under reflection, and pain.
Two years I never slept too tired to lie or rest.
Too tired to forget your name.

I felt the morning for the first time since you closed your eyes.
I never thought I could again.

Two years have caused too much.
This fog is not enough.
I need to flush out the blame.

Now I can feel it.
Like the first day of the summer.
Now I can feel it.
Like the water in the desert.

I saw your shadow lost.
I heard it whispering.
Calling and falling in shame.
In your return of life, are you as lost as I?
Is your deception the same?

To keep myself from falling.
I dreamt that you were running while.
Walking through a pattern.
Whispering a holy light.

Drifting through the water.
I began to feel the light.
Slowly into water.

Now I can feel it.
Like the first day of the summer.
Now I can feel it.
Like the water in the desert.
Now I can feel it.

I gave a part of me unto the water.
But, no one's there.
I gave a promise to try to follow you.
No one's there.
Oh, no one's there.

Oh.
Now I can feel it.
Now I can feel it.
Like the first day of the summer.
Now I can feel it.
Like the water in the desert.
Now I can feel it.
