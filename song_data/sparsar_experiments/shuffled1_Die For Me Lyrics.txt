Die For Me Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

I know I'd die for you  .
  .
I know I'll die for you  .
  .
Wish you would be like me - a fool  .
  .
But will you die for me?  .
Bleed for tomorrow  .
Makes no difference if you're never gonna fuckin' try  .
I want you....
I know I'd die for you  .
Feed off my sorrow  .
  .
  .
But will you die for me?  .
.
  .
I know I'll die for you  .
I know I'll die for you  .
Have I lost myself to someone else?  .
Truth, lie, to live or die  .
  .
Twenty-one years of my life to go  .
I know I'll die for you  .
Feed off my sorrow  .
  .
I want you to...  .
I want you to...  .
Makes no difference, you're never gonna fuckin' try  .
Can you feel it, can you see it, do you want me to  .
  .
See me standing, so fucking cool  .
Truth, lie, to live or die  .
Bleed for tomorrow  .
I want you to...  .
Will you die for me?  .
Feed off my sorrow  .
Will you die for me?  .
  .
