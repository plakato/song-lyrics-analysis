J.Life Lyrics
by ViZion.


ViZion.

I can see.
See into the future.
And I see.
So many people suffer.
I can see.
See into the future.
And I believe.
That this world is ours, yea.

Everyday and I'm working around.
And they waan' bring me down, but they can't stop my sound no.
Cause I'm on this road that I've found.
So they can't tie me down, when the king wears the crown yaay.
And I've got this fire in me so I glow.
And I'm aiming higher, burning kaya so I'm never know.
Up into the sky, I see my ViZion's hope.
Painted in the rainbow colors of kaleidoscopes.

I can see.
See into the future.
And I see.
So many people suffer.
I can see.
See into the future.
And I believe.
That this world is ours, yea.

I'm made of these diamonds, made up of this shine so.
I wake up in this hard time, and fade not, when the lights low.
I stay far from shadows, darkness and shallows.
My way home, to halos and estate homes, straight arrows.
Through the pain, I made the change.
And broke the chain of frustration.
Over hate, I elevate.
Illuminate, what I need to grow.
This is just beginnings of beginnings in a circle with no ending.
I'm going with my blessings till I get it.

I can see.
See into the future.
And I see.
So many people suffer.
I can see.
See into the future.
And I believe.
That this world is ours, yea.

Under this tree, I sit, and reminisce about my life.
Past times, friends and family would pass by.
Equal rights and justice for every man like I.
Keep aiming to the sky cause nothing ever beat a try.
The journey long, I'm standing firm and holding on.
Rolling on in these streets, never, not going down.
And still I see, 'nuff hatred and bad mind.
But them can't stop my shine, tell them that it's my time.
I'm moving on, far away from negative.
I'm stirring up and mixing up in only positive.
The life we live, belongs to the Most High.
So let's reply and gives praises everyday and night.

I can see.
See into the future.
And I see.
So many people suffer.
I can see.
See into the future.
And I believe.
That this world is ours, yea.

Suffer.
I can see, yeaaa agh.
Yeea.
