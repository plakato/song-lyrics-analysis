Braveheart Lyrics
by United Kingdom.


Beware the beast man for he is the devil's pawn.
Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust greed.
Today he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land.
Let him not breed in great numbers.
For he will make a desert of his home and yours.
Shun him for he is the avenger of death.

Yo, Braveheart, verbal courage, battle the seminar.
Royal Fam Legacy, watch us travel far.
Positive energy, always corrects errors, Royal Fam rulin this.
Now and forever, what.
Play your part braveheart, play your part braveheart.
Play your part braveheart, play your part braveheart.

Timbo King - Royal Fam.
Orotorical, niggas is metaphorical.
My editorial breaks down your monuments historical.
Geologists studying land, using the earth's crust.
Measurements, eight elements, atomic weight plus density.
Hi-Techs, science, thrustal gravity.
Revolve around my oro, I'm the soul that keeps spinning, what.
Supernova, black quasar, my mental radar picks up.
Frequencies way beyond the earth's equator.
Forver glow, electro, magnetic force field.
Thoughts build, we bomb for real, 36 still exists.
Golden fist, your caught up in the devil's mist.
Fire war, royal sire laws, revealing this.
Protons, electrons, atoms cause explosions.
My center of atraction, I'm the nucleus, you're frozen.
My square be complete, architectual, visual.
The sound spectrum strikes the mental then the physical.
My perimeter damns your diameter.
Bar codes are scanned from America to Canada.
What, from America to Canada.
