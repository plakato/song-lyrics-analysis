Jellybones Lyrics
by The Unicorns.

Patient.
For so long, I trailed you, now here I am.
But I can't stand with these jellybones.

Checked myself into emergency, urgently.
Drove up in my bone-camarrow,.
thinking only about you.
The doctor walked her crew of surgeons to the table where I lay.
I came to, and my kneecaps were off.
They were soft, I had jellybones.

Doctor.
I woke him up and broke the news.
After everything was sewn.
I said, Son, you've got a full-blown case.
Of what is known as Jellybones.

Refrain.
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly.
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly.
Jelly, jellybones.

But this is love, so we'll survive.
This is love, so we'll survive.
But this is love, so we'll survive.
This is love, so we'll survive.
This is love, so we'll survive.
This is love, so we'll survive.
This is love, so we'll survive.
