Gorgeous Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


I might be better off without you.
There's too many people all around you.
All these vultures that surround you.
They don't know a thing about you.

You're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.
Ooh, you're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.

Nobody understands you.
You ain't nothing they can handle.
Every man you put your hands on.
You make him feel so god damn handsome.

Feel, ooh, so pretty whenever you're around.
Ooh, so pretty.
Feel ten feet off the ground.

You're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.
Ooh, you're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.

We are young, we are free.
Like renegades, like James Dean.
Beat the drum, sing off-key.
You set me free, you set me free.

Cause you're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.
Ooh, you're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.
You're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.
You're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.
You're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.
Ooh, you're so gorgeous.
Cause you make me feel gorgeous.
