100th Blunt of The Day (Freestyles) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


Who can say where the road goes.
Where the day flows, only time.
Who can say where the road goes.
Where the day flows, only time.

:.

Anything but human, anything but normal.
George Washington in my blunt that's a quarter.
Niggas want my bitch they can't afford her.
Niggas want me dead, all these bitches want my ora.

:.

You see Wulf and Yung God through with that hood poetry.
This crazy bitch say she hate me but come over please.
I said hell nah Ima smoke while you get over me.

When she see me she see glattis glitter covering me.
When I blink my eyes she collapse due to the flattery.
She said boy lets fuck I ain't understand cause she said it in Japanese.
Bitch switched to chinese, cantonese, vietnamese, taiwanese.
English please, damn bitch.

Who can say where the road goes.
Where the day flows, only time.
Who can say where the road goes.
Where the day flows, only time.
X2.
