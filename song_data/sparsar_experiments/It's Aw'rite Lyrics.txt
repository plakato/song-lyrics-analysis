It's Aw'rite Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.


Baby baby tell me what you're gon na do
Baby tell me what you're gon na do
You do me wrong. --, you won't come home
Make me feel so blue

Baby baby, you are the one for me
Baby you're, the one for me
You. Take my money --! That ain't funny
Leave me in misery

Come on baby and a-listen
Every time. I see you, you a-twistin'
Never, never, never, never! Lonely
You'Re, always always doin'. The pony
Don't see why you wan na mess around
Can't find you when the sun goes down

It's aw'rite

Come on baby, bring me my money
Don't. You lie why you act so funny: 

It's aw'rite

Early in the mornin' can't get it right
Had a date with my baby last night

It's aw'rite
