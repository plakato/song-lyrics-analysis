It's Aw'rite Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.


Baby, baby, tell me what you're gonna do.
Baby, tell me what you're gonna do.
You do me wrong -- you won't come home.
Make me feel so blue.

Baby, baby, you are the one for me.
Baby, you're the one for me.
You take my money -- that ain't funny.
Leave me in misery.

Come on, baby and a-listen.
Every time I see you you a-twistin'.
Never never never never lonely.
You're always, always doin' the pony.
Don't see why you wanna mess around.
Can't find you when the sun goes down.

It's aw'rite.

Come on baby, bring me my money.
Don't you lie, why you act so funny?

It's aw'rite.

Early in the mornin', can't get it right.
Had a date with my baby last night.

It's aw'rite.
