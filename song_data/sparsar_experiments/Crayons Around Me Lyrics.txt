Crayons Around Me Lyrics
by Unique B..


Everybody do the crayon, crayon.
X4.

I'm aware of my surroundings. Everyone is a color.
For once, we'll do it for a greater cause: Each other.
Let's act like some Brothers and sisters.
So well can make this beautiful picture.

Red, Black, Yellow, Green, Purple, and turquoise.
A splash of heavy duty paint, will definitely hurt boy.
We've been using these colors the wrong way.
Martin said one day these white and black children will play together.

And now they do and it's no big thang.
But dont forget everyone had to march and sang.
Black folk, blue person, red people.
We all equal in God's eyes, that's the way he sees us.

Diversity makes a great painting.
My 2nd impressionistic movement is in the making.
Yeah the world is full of many colors.
6.4 billion in this box and many others.
