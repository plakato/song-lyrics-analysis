Under The Big Black Sun Lyrics
by X.

What I did on my vacation.
For the last ten years.
I took pictures of your town.
Plaid perfume on my breath.
I mean I've been drinking scotch.
While touring through your town.
Adultery makes you give things away it gets you confused.
Adultery takes a one room vacation.
Then it gets you alone.
Turns into a hoonymoon scream.
Then you have to change the sheets.
Smoke in one hand looking for a light.
Martini in the other hand.
Pointing out midnight.
Now that you pulled the school underwater.
And drowned the prom.
Which man will you save for this friday.
You can put him in a fish pond.
And watch him swim around.
Then have a catholic dinner.
If it isn't men it's death.
It's the same old testament.
At the cross her station keeping.
Stood the mournful mother weeping.
Where my man extended hung.
Driven with nails to wood.
Smoke in one hand looking for a drink.
Drink in the other hand.
Pointing out midnight.
At my desk as you're sleeping.
As the big deal of death.
Kills me and starts leaving.
Everybody asks me how i'm doing.
I'm doing everything alone.
Rave on children and try to sleep.
Larks must sing grave, deep melodies.
Happy that they die.
The sly brown fox pulled up a glass.
Pulled up a chair and yanked out my hair.
When i tried to sit i fell down.
When i woke up he was gone.
So one has a smoke one has a drink.
The man is gone.
Mary's dead, good morning midnight!
