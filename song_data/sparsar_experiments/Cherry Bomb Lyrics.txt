Cherry Bomb Lyrics
by The Runaways.

Can'T stay at home can't stay at school, 
Old folks, say'You, poor little fool' 
Down the streets, I'm the girl next door, 
I'm, the fox you've been waiting for 
 
Hello daddy., Hello, mom, 
I'm, your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb 
Hello world. I'M your wild girl, 
I'm, your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb, 
, 
Stone, age, love and strange sounds too 
Come on baby. Let me get to you 
Bad nights, causing teenage blues 
Get down. Ladies you've got nothin' to lose 
 
Hello daddy., Hello, mom 
I'm, your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb 
Hello world. I'M your wild girl, 
I'm, your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb, 
 
Hey street boy want some style, 
Your dead, end dreams, don't make you smile 
I'll, give you something to live for, 
Have you and grab you until you're sore 
, 
Hello, daddy., Hello, mom, 
I'm, your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb 
Hello world. I'M your wild girl, 
I'm your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb 
 
Cherry bomb 
Cherry bomb 
Cherry bomb 
Cherry, bomb
