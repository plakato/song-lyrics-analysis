Barnes' Yard Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Oh let's lie down for another night.
I'll hold you close under these skies.
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives.
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives.
We struggle to tear ourselves apart in the night.
We struggle to tear ourselves apart in the light.
Your father's on his way back home from site.
Your mother's in the kitchen batting her eyelash.
She would never want to be the one to despise.
And our heartbeats stop as we plunge through the ice.

We're broken down lovers at the side of the road.
We're broken down lovers in the city of oil.
There's nothing going wrong in your empty home.
There's nothing going wrong and we'll leave it alone.
Let's slip under the covers just to save our lives.
And our heartbeats stop as we plunge through the ice.

Triple up your socks to dodge the frostbite.
Cutting through Barnes' Yard hip deep in the night.
Rough and tumble lovers underneath the covers tonight.
I was holding onto you and you were holding me tight.
Nothing's going wrong and nothing's ever going.

Oh let's lie down for another night.
I'll hold you close under these skies.
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives.
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives.
We struggle to tear ourselves apart in the night.
And there's nothing going wrong in the city tonight.

Nothing's going wrong and nothing's ever holding us down.
Nothing's going wrong and no one's ever holding us down.
Your parents, they say There's beautiful things in this old place.
Your parents, they say There's beautiful things in this cold place.
Now your parents say There's nothing for us in this old place.
Don't leave me to stay and dream of how you're growing old.

Let's lie down for another night.
I'll hold you close under these skies.
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives.
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives.
We struggle to tear ourselves apart in the night.
And there's nothing going wrong in the city tonight.
