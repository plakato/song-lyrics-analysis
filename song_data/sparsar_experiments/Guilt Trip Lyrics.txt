Guilt Trip Lyrics
by PUP (band).

How many times have you lied to my face? 
I can't confront you, it's better that way
How many bulbs must I break
'Til all my filaments rust and decay 
And. I can't explain anything anymore anyway

Now that you're gone I'll, be back on my own
Giving. It all up to leave. You alone
And. If I had my choice, I would come back. Soon
I never wanted to

How many times have. I lied to you 
If I was drunk when I said it. It might've been true

I know now that you're gone, I'm back on my own
Giving it all up to leave. You alone
And, if I had my choice, I would die by your love
I know it wasn't enough

Why. Would you speak if you don't know 
Got a little bit of my self-righteous attitude

Now that you're gone I'll, be back on my own
Felt, her up fucked her up left her alone
If. I had it all in the palm of my hand
Don't. Even ask cause you won't understand.
