Song: Beautiful Mind.
Typed by: Johnny Warbux.

Single male seeking female with a beautiful mind.
And a physic to keep me peeping like, Damn she's fine..
Let's take a date with destiny.
Shoot across the galaxy.
Just me and she.
She and I acting out fantasies.
Hobbies me?
Swimming in the Milky Way.
Playing marbles with the stars.
My noggins spaced out like that.
No sense.
Why even charge me of malarkey?
Grounded my heart beat.
But my mind sky larks.
See?
Hold the phrase, What if? like a car key.
Roll with me.
The brain race like road rage.
Strap in before you start me up.
Where the side walk ends is where I dare to jump.
Parachute while shooting out paragraphs.
Let's rap.
Love conversations that tickle your funny bone, make you laugh.
Yeah, I'm comedy.
But not funny like ha ha.
The type of funny that you chuckle at when out of ya mind.
Birth sign Aquarius.
People think they see me like, Where he go? There he is..
Thoughts don't drift in one line.
Movements various.
I'm a daydream catcher.
For your love and laughter I fish.
Sailing on the winds blown after making a wish.
You're number one on my to do list.

Scarub If so beautiful your mind is.
Scarub &amp; Eligh Your money or you mind which is timeless.
Scarub Most seek fortune but it's rare that you'll find.
Scarub One millionaire of ten with a beautiful mind.
MURS You can't buy youth when you're old or food for your soul.
MURS Friends when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold.
MURS The wealthiest person is the poorest at times.
MURS When compared to the one with a beautiful mind.

Its the muscle I use to hustle my voice.
A tussle to choose management of thought in my shoes.
Not easy at times.
Voices chatter at night, meeting of mind.
Inside of my tank.
The scent of a woman passes your nose.
Left an impression for life.
A possession in time.
Lesson in strife.
Decompression of love.
Lives from the past.
Embodied in me.
Regrettably free.
Free to wander the planes.

My body lies over the ocean but my mind will fly.
Beautiful thing shelter from the rain.
Forgetting the pain, letting it stream down the drain.
In the form of denial.
The trial and error.
To stare at your problems with heroism and win.
Beginning of sin.
End of the beginning and then.
Some numb it with narcotic to fend from the demons within.
Blurring the vision.
Wisdom occurring through prism.
Colors of hope.
Shining bright like a beacon is my eye when I'm speaking.
3rd is the level I'm freakin' flows.
For the people who listen, know.
That it's all a tradition, grow.
With a plant of my purpose.
Land on my feet in the circus ring.
I'm the master who work the crowd.
With a beautiful mind to tide the times.

Scarub If so beautiful your mind is.
Scarub &amp; Eligh Your money or you mind which is timeless.
Scarub Most seek fortune but it's rare that you'll find.
Scarub One millionaire of ten with a beautiful mind.
MURS You can't buy youth when you're old or food for your soul.
MURS Friends when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold.
MURS The wealthiest person is the poorest at times.
MURS When compared to the one with a beautiful mind.

I know I'm only using 10% of what you offer.
But I feed you what I'm reading.
Trying to brighten up my chakras.
Imposters.
Hide behind degrees and certificates.
Some seek to expand you by using barbiturates.
I'm sitting with this book.
Tryin' to get a better look.
Through these words as mirror I should hope to see you clearer.
I'm a figment of your imagination it appears.
So mold me.
Shape me.
Hold me.
Take me.
Existence is a window and our dreams are the draperies.
Lately, I'm lonely cause you're still the only.
One who understands my plans and consoles me.
I'm hoping we can find.
That match for our soul.
And through that union we become a new whole.
But for now it's you and I and the life we create.
Destiny we control and the fate that we shape.
That's enough to keep us busy till we find the right mate.
But if we never do.
At least I had this time with you.
One body one mind, we combined the two.
A pair like us you'll only find a few.
Until my last day I pray I stay this way with you.

Your money or you mind which is timeless......

Beautiful mind......
