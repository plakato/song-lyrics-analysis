New Warz.

Lyrics:.

Yes! yes!
G Sound , Viva Fidel - we.
organizing!
Uh.

Everything you see in the world ,.
you gone see at your door.
America under martial law starting 'New Warz'.
I ain't gone waste no time I ain't got the energy.
I use every line to undermine the enemy.

My, My music is a weapon against.
white supremacy and I ain't scared.
to say it.....
Yall just scared to play it.
And my white fans lovin it they don't give a fuck about the government.

But that ain't all it is.....
We converting all these kids.
Take a mental pilgrimage and.
reminisce.
To your traditional heritage, now.
tell me this.
Would you go back in time, or travel to the future.
If you had the chance, to rewind or advance.....
Would you take a glance at ya.
life.
Realize ya own legacy?
This is 360 mutal heavenly for all.
my Ebony queens.
Who definitely need the love and the therapy.
I had a dream....

Everything you see in the world,.
you gone see at your door.
America under martial law starting.
New Warz.
I ain't gone waste no time that ain't the solution.
I use every line to spark a revolution.

They ask me what happened to hip hop?
And I say he shot a cop, and now he on the run and they ain't gone never.
find the gun \- but now they.
profiling everyone.....
And its constant danger.
Economic anger.
I make it hard on a traitor.
And make it my movie trailer.
Blame it on mamma nature for the.
trees that made the paper.
My notebook full of razors, my pen.
is like a laser.
You see inferred beams, my team is.
the Taste Emcees\- 5 star Gs.

Remove all the doubters with pure poetry.
My 'Listening Project'.
Live &amp; direct prescription medicine, my plot is evident.
Locate the leaders , warriors &amp; teachers.
The real elevation, coming through ya speakers.

Everything you see in the world you gone see at ya door.
America under martial law starting.
'New Warz'.
I ain't gone waste no time that ain't the strategy.
I use every line to uplift the family.
