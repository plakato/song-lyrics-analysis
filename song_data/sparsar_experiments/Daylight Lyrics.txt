Daylight Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


I can't look at you in the same light 
Knowing. What you did in my heart doesn't feel right. 
Yeah, my head's been tripping all night 
I need another point of view. 
I got a friend who's committed to sci-fi 
He's read every comic he's addicted to Twilight. 
He'Ll, give you the Goosebumps 
But he's. Never lead me wrong. 
He said: she's got a method of kidding 
Pulling you in like you're gon na start kissing 
Fooling around until you lost all feeling 
Sucking your blood. Until your heart stops beating 
 
Before, we started, it was over 
I feel our bodies getting colder. 
She gives me 
A feeling that I can't fight 
And, it's the road that leads to nowhere. 
But. All I want to do is go there. 
She'S got me 
Running from the daylight daylight. 
 
I got a taste for it and I'm obsessed 
Lying here, no fear of the darkness 
Now, I'm not happy. Unless 
I'm close enough to you 
And all these dreams, I'm dreaming 
Freaking me out. I wish I knew the meaning 
Doesn't make sense, because I'm just not seeing 
How I'm alive. It feels like I'm, not breathing 
 
Before, we started it was over 
I feel our bodies getting colder. 
She gives me 
A feeling that I can't fight 
And. It'S the road that leads to nowhere 
But. All I want to do is go there. 
She'S got me 
Running from the daylight daylight 
 
I'm, not ready to start again, 
And you're not willing to make amends 
Now the daylight's, dangerous 
It will turn us both to dust. 
_I'M not ready to start again 
And you're, not willing to make amends 
Now the daylight's dangerous 
And. It is much too late for us_ 
 
Before we started it was over 
I feel our bodies getting colder. 
She gives me 
A feeling that I can't fight 
And. It'S the road that leads to nowhere 
But. All I want to do is go there. 
She'S got me 
Running from the daylight daylight 
 
Before we started, it was over 
I feel our bodies getting colder. 
She gives me 
A feeling that I can't fight 
And. It'S the road that leads to nowhere 
But. All I want to do is go there. 
She'S got me 
Running from the daylight daylight
