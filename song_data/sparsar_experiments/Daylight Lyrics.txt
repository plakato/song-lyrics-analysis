Daylight Lyrics
by 5 Seconds of Summer.


I can't look at you in the same light.
Knowing what you did in my heart doesn't feel right.
Yeah, my head's been tripping all night.
I need another point of view.
I got a friend who's committed to sci-fi.
He's read every comic, he's addicted to Twilight.
He'll give you the Goosebumps.
But he's never lead me wrong.
He said, she's got a method of kidding.
Pulling you in like you're gonna start kissing.
Fooling around until you lost all feeling.
Sucking your blood until your heart stops beating.

Before we started, it was over.
I feel our bodies getting colder.
She gives me.
A feeling that I can't fight.
And it's the road that leads to nowhere.
But all I want to do is go there.
She's got me.
Running from the daylight, daylight.

I got a taste for it and I'm obsessed.
Lying here, no fear of the darkness.
Now I'm not happy unless.
I'm close enough to you.
And all these dreams I'm dreaming.
Freaking me out, I wish I knew the meaning.
Doesn't make sense because I'm just not seeing.
How I'm alive, it feels like I'm not breathing.

Before we started it was over.
I feel our bodies getting colder.
She gives me.
A feeling that I can't fight.
And it's the road that leads to nowhere.
But all I want to do is go there.
She's got me.
Running from the daylight, daylight.

I'm not ready to start again.
And you're not willing to make amends.
Now the daylight's dangerous.
It will turn us both to dust.
_I'm not ready to start again.
And you're not willing to make amends.
Now the daylight's dangerous.
And it is much too late for us_.

Before we started, it was over.
I feel our bodies getting colder.
She gives me.
A feeling that I can't fight.
And it's the road that leads to nowhere.
But all I want to do is go there.
She's got me.
Running from the daylight, daylight.

Before we started, it was over.
I feel our bodies getting colder.
She gives me.
A feeling that I can't fight.
And it's the road that leads to nowhere.
But all I want to do is go there.
She's got me.
Running from the daylight, daylight.
