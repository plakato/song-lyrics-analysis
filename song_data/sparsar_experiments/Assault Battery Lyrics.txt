Assault Battery Lyrics
by Swollen Members.

Mad Child.
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery.
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery.
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery.
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery.

Blood rushing excitement, eternity of darkness.
Trust me, you don't want to start this, I'm heartless.
Colder than this, this is some rip your face apart shit.
Department for the clinicly insane, my apartment.
Transmit total derangement, an engaging engagement.
Crystal prism, abstract expressionism.
I'm back, from vision, empressionist on a mission.
Battling psychopaths, slightly sick and twisted.
Social butterfly in a glove, double fisted.
Silver streak, mean rays of purple haze.
White widow, the flames, ponder in his veins.
Now, wandering in days, no signs of weakness.
How can you critique this, can't even compete with.
The ultra electric, startling when battling.
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery.
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery.

Prevail.
Words are staggering, daggering like a tragedy.
Words are staggering, daggering like a tragedy.
Words are staggering, daggering like a tragedy.
Words are staggering, daggering like a tragedy.

You can be all in my face without toxic fool.
You can be all in my face, but I could lose my cool.
My attempt to hold back could backfire on you.
My new identity is an entity to the tone of two.
My totally true tongue ties titanium in two.
To the places that we roam, tombstones are overgrown.
Projects are overblown, reflections are never shown.
Connections are never cloned, sucessions are over the phone.
Like my vocal catacomb, that knows to abandon homes.
Since those, from nine to five to collide with my form.
My forum's held Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
Maybe one day, you'll learn how to do it the Prev One way.
Until then, I kill them until they get it straight.
When they move for the bigger fish, focused on the bait.
In this audio bizarre, noone knows who you are.
No descendents of Ham, no babies are taught.
Leave the black in the cold and the cold in the bar.
Like a shifted momentum, who would've thought.
Anyone could contend them, I'll bend them.
And send them to the lions in the kingdom.

Mad Child.
Death by invitation, torturing teens in bondage.
Approaching a scene, mentally unharnessing carnage.
Hell hath no fury, pathological liar.
Tails, halos and horns, kings of sinful desire.
The ultimate degenerate, iron chain lashing.
Knife weilding, eye gouging and scalpel flashing.
The cult classic, with intense scenes of gore.
Imploding my load as I melt into the floor.
A sexual awakaning, sadistic hypnotist.
Poisinous tantrest, switch to dominatrix.
Distorted form of forbid of flesh for sensation.
Mind of a serial killer, locked concentration.
Sweet taste of bliss, in from the Holy Grail.
Now hold the hand of pleasure as we hitch hike to hell.
