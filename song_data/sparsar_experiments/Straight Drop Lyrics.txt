Straight Drop Lyrics
by UNK.

DFB.
I keep that drop for the low-low, weigh it ship it out the do'.
Stuff 'em into {?} stashed around the 24.
Hit the road, hit the flows, bend that in a minivan.
TV cameras in the dash, money wrapped in rubber bands.
Flipped a couple grand, straight dropped it on a watch.
Diamond bezel, 30 karats, just a kid from the block.
Oh my God, there he go, calm me down I need a fan.
Big Oomp rappers see my chain, and DJ Mike say he ain't playin.
Straight drop lookin breezy, got you hoes lookin cheesy.
DJ Oomp, {?}, straight drop I'm off the heezy.
Eyes shifty, try to creep me, got that heat, right beneath me.
Straight drop, Oomp Camp, black tint, you can't see me.

Whassup Big Allen, we got your back.
Straight from the A-Town, Big Oomp Records.
DJ Jelly, DJ Montae, straight drop.

Yeahhhh, we just drop nigga.
Yeahhhh, straight drop nigga.
Straight drop nigga - yeah, straight drop nigga - yeah.
Straight drop nigga - what? Straight drop nigga - what?

{*Oomp Camp nuts scratched*}.
