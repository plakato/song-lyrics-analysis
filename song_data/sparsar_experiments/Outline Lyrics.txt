Outline Lyrics
by Worm Is Green.


So cold inside.
You talked about yourself.
Through the night.

You make me happy.
Make me sad.

After all the things.
We didn't say.

So cold inside.
You talked about yourself.
Through the night.

You make me high.
You make me sad.

For all the things.
That I regret.
