Comin Thru Lyrics
by Russ.


Yeah, see the difference between me.
And whoever fuck is tryna do this shit too.
I don't need to speak for you to hear me.

Yeah, the rewards of self belief have turned me into an addict.
Girls cheating, being hoes has turned me into a savage.
Before I knew I was a prodigy, I was still bringing havoc.
And my musics full of movies, all my shit's cinematic.
Sometimes I feel insane, sometimes my mind should be padded.
I'm just fucking up my walls, but I still build a palace.
Cause there's more gold in my mind than you can mine in the Earth.
Imagination flying free, my potential's my worth.
Searching, saying for the longest I'm gonna be rich any minute.
Rich is just a state of mind, believe me, I'm in it.
Vanilla range, peanut butter seats with the windows tinted.
That's the car, I get my sister off these iTunes digits.
That watch says its coming, that car says I did it.
I'mma drop a classic debut called I'm not finished.
And I'm not fishing, but the money's swimming closer.
So these hoes are getting thirstier, tryna grab my super soaker.

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now.
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now.
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now.
Saying the same shit like I do this for you now.
Yeah, I do this for you now.

Let me tell y'all something.

Yeah, now when you have everything, you don't need anything.
But when you have everything, they're down for anything.
See there's a lot of people who just look at you as a come up.
So they mistreat you, they see the ornaments.
They wanna take yours to hang they own on they Christmas tree.
I just believed you cause I was raised with love.
You thought I was the lick, but you ain't slick.
See people change with love, try to take advantage.
Cause they view it as a weakness like I'mma do whatever I want.
And he won't see shit coming, but I peep bitch running.
Keep it moving with your basic ass.
Y'all small town hoes are all the same, I gotta plane to catch.
Might sign a motherfucking deal.
Might buy some motherfucking wheels.
But just know, if I offer you the lifeline it's motherfucking real.
Unless you DIEMON, my family or my fans, heres the plan, fuck 'em.

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now.
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now.
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now.
Saying the same shit like I do this for you now.
Yeah, I do this for you now.

I'mma just talk shit one more time.

Yeah, money right around the corner.
I'm just waiting for the pick up.
You call that shit a sixteen? I call that shit a pick up.
Listen to your songs, sounding like you give up.
Rappers sounding weak, I guess it's time for us to lift up.
This whole game, cause Drakes the only one who's fucking shit up.
The rest of y'all, hiding in the shadows like a ninja.
But fuck your stealth, Russ is making noise.
Turning up on myself like what.

Yeah, move to the back, Russ is coming through now.
Truth coming out, what you gonna do now?
Looking at the mirror like I do this for you now.
Looking at my family and my fans and my crew now.
Saying the same shit like I do this for you now.
Yeah, I do this for you now.

And I'm still fucking here like.
