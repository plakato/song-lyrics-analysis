We're Not Gonna Take It Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Oh We're Not Gonna Take It.
No, We Ain't Gonna Take It.
Oh We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore.

We've Got The Right To Choose And.
There Ain't No Way We'll Lose It.
This Is Our Life, This Is Our Song.
We'll Fight The Powers That Be Just.
Don't Pick Our Destiny cause.
You Don't Know Us, You Don't Belong.

Oh We're Not Gonna Take It.
No, We Ain't Gonna Take It.
Oh We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore.

Oh You're So Condescending.
Your Gall Is Never Ending.
We Don't Want Nothin', Not A Thing From You.
Your Life Is Trite And Jaded.
Boring And Confiscated.
If That's Your Best, Your Best Won't Do.

Oh................
Oh................
We're Right/yeah.
We're Free/yeah.
We'll Fight/yeah.
You'll See/yeah.

Oh We're Not Gonna Take It.
No, We Ain't Gonna Take It.
Oh We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore.

Oh We're Not Gonna Take It.
No, We Ain't Gonna Take It.
Oh We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore.
No Way!

Oh...............
Oh...............
We're Right/yeah.
We're Free/yeah.

You'll See/yeah.

We're Not Gonna Take It.
No, We Ain't Gonna Take It.
We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore.

We're Not Gonna Take It, No!
No, We Ain't Gonna Take It.
We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore.

Just You Try And Make Us.
We're Not Gonna Take It.
Come On.
No, We Ain't Gonna Take It.
You're All Worthless And Weak.
We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore.
Now Drop And Give Me Twenty.
We're Not Gonna Take It.
Oh Crinch Pin.
No, We Ain't Gonna Take It.
Oh You And Your Uniform.
We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore.
