Ejection Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


“We don't smoke, or drink, or swear, we're pure to the core.” /.
“Oh shit we forgot our smokes at the liquor store” /.
Yo, all I see are gluttons/ puffing/ till it hurts their stomach/.
Thinking that this life is worth nothing/.
They're ignoring the ancient prophetic words of rage spoken/.
Now all Hell has been let loose, and Satan's cage opened/.
But he's got nothing to chase cause all of them run to him/.
And he'll lead them by apathy to places that are dim/.
To where you can shop/ till you drop/ and listen to your Christian Pop/.
Where you can be a Blackman and still be a W.A.S.P./.
You can tell me to stop/ but truth is the consumer creed from.
The Cindys to the Sams/ is “I shop therefore I am” /.
The tight rope you walk will snap back like a rubber band/.
And the right hope you mock will rap back like a mother mad/.
Hating the west/ maybe a global trend/.
But you don't have to stress/ their already dead/.

There's a difference between running the block and running on the block/.
I know, I've done'em both, I've done'em a lot so/.
I'm gonna tell ya what you oughta hear, not what you wanna hear/.
If we continue how we're living, I gotta get outta here/.

You arrange yourself around a TV in high Def./.
And because of it your mind has a short depth/.
But it keeps us safe, and secure, and idle/.
In the ancient days we would have called you an idol/.
You desensitize us to the vile/ if I ripped up.
The floor tile by tile/ I'd find dead rotting bodies/.
Of those who missed the sign posts and lived in denial/.
Killing themselves so they could buy an Audi/ all the while/.
Reality is a blood trench slaughterhouse/ it's tripping me out/.
But in your fantasy it's a nice Mickey Mouse/.
Then when your people's/ kids plan/ with illegal/ contraband/.
Your tiny world wasn't just rocked; your world was avalanched/.
Yo you go to war, and your kids act like you but.
You're keeping it musical/ with the Seussical/.
Cause Horton hears a who/ to kill them all/.
Because a victim is a victim no matter how small/.

Yo, truth, runs my mind, like God runs the Earth/ it gives.
And takes away then I ask what I'm worth/ and he.
Humbles me in the sight of all this/ cause he.
Can turn a city into a necropolis/ but the.
Meaning of this next line you'll learn is encrypted/ you can't.

Cause mostof my old friends say ‘Fuck the world' but make love to it/.
And in their stupidity, they all choose to succumb to it/.
In my critique of suburbia/ I know that the Hood is in a hurry ta/.
Be just as bad and it worries our/.
Consumer society that buys magazines/.
With celebrities who smile but like you die in agony/.
Pleasure- not pain- is the death knell of meaning/.
A measure of how you live your life is your pace of breathing/.
Cause if you breath quickly, so anxiously/.
You're too close to Death's kiss, when it just aches to be/.
