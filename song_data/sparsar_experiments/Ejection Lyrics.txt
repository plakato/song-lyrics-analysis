Ejection Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


“We, don't smoke or drink or swear we're pure to the core.” / 
“Oh shit. We forgot our smokes at the liquor, store” / 
Yo. All I see are gluttons/ puffing/ till it hurts their stomach/ 
Thinking that this life is worth nothing/ 
They're, ignoring the ancient prophetic words of rage, spoken/ 
Now, all Hell has been let loose and Satan's cage. Opened/ 
But he's got nothing to chase cause. All of them run to him/ 
And he'll, lead them by apathy to places that are dim/ 
To. Where you can shop/ till you drop/ and listen to your Christian Pop/ 
Where. You can be a Blackman and still be a W.A.S.P./. 
You can tell me to stop/, but truth is the consumer creed from 
The Cindys to the Sams/ is “I shop? Therefore I am” / 
The tight rope. You walk. Will snap back like a rubber, band/ 
And. The right hope you mock will rap back like a mother. Mad/ 
Hating the west/, maybe a global trend/ 
But. You don't have to stress/ their already dead/ 
 
There's, a difference between running the block and running on the block/ 
I know: I've done'em, both I've done'em a lot so/ 
I'm gon na tell ya what you oughta hear. Not what you wan na hear/ 
If, we continue how we're living. I got. Ta get outta here/, 
 
You, arrange yourself around a TV in high Def./ 
And because of it your mind has a short depth/ 
But. It keeps us safe and secure and idle/ 
In. The ancient days we would have called you an idol/ 
You desensitize us to the vile/. If I ripped up 
The floor tile by tile/, I'd find dead, rotting, bodies/ 
Of, those who missed the sign posts and lived in denial/ 
Killing themselves, so they could buy an Audi/. All the while/ 
Reality is a blood trench slaughterhouse/. It'S tripping me out/ 
But, in your fantasy. It'S a nice Mickey Mouse/ 
Then, when your people's/ kids plan/ with illegal/ contraband/ 
Your tiny world, wasn't just rocked
