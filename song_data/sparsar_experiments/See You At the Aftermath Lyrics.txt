See You At the Aftermath Lyrics
by Two o'clock courage.

Cause there's nothing we have that popularity can't cure and we're almost.
there.
Cause there's nothing we have that popularity can't cure and we're almost.
there.

I know where this can't go.

Are just the guilt winning.

Your lips get on the map.

Just make sure we leave a trail.

It's all under control.

Right into a ghost town.

Burning everything worth saving.

Cause there's nothing we have that popularity can't cure and we're almost.
there.

There's nothing we have that popularity can't cure and we're almost there.

These lips are for gossip.

But I'll keep faking it.

Cause nothing can stop us.

Just make sure we leave a trail.

How I remember this.

Right into a ghost town.

Burning everything worth saving.

Cause there's nothing we have that popularity can't cure and we're almost.
there.

There's nothing we have that popularity can't cure and we're almost there.

There!!! ohh, get the fuck up.

We'll burn us straight to hell.

We'll burn us straight to hell.

Cause there's nothing we have that popularity can't cure and we're almost.
there.
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

We'll spend a night burning everything worth saving.

We'll spend a night burning everything worth saving.

Don't look back just make sure you leave a trail.

Don't look back just make sure you leave a trail.
