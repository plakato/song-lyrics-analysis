No Coke Lyrics
by Quiero Club.


Go tiger!

When everything's gone.
When everything's done.
Give me some more.
How does it feel like?
What are you talking about?

I DON'T LIKE DRINKING COKE.
I DON'T LIKE DRINKING COKE.
I DON'T LIKE DRINKING COKE.
I DON'T LIKE DRINKING COKE.

When you're feelin' dizzy.
Uptight 'n easy.
Light me a joint.
Give me a blow.
How does it feel like?
What are you talking about?

NO ME GUSTA LA COKE.
NO ME GUSTA LA COKE.
NO ME GUSTA LA COKE.
NO ME GUSTA LA COKE.
Oh, stop!

When everything's gone.
When everything's done.
Give me some more.
How does it feel like?
What are you talking about?

When you're feelin' dizzy.
Uptight 'n easy.
Light me a joint.
Give me a blow.
How does it feel like?
What are you talking about?

I DON'T LIKE DRINKING COKE.
I DON'T LIKE DRINKING COKE.
I DON'T LIKE DRINKING COKE.
I DON'T LIKE DRINKING COKE.

We don't like, don't use, don't buy, don't do, don't do coke.
We don't like, don't use, don't buy, don't do, don't do coke.
We don't like, don't use, don't buy, don't do, don't do coke.
We don't like, don't use, don't buy, don't do, don't do coke.

Give me the music!
Oh, oh, oh , oh!
Oh, oh, oh , oh!
Oh, oh, oh , oh!......
