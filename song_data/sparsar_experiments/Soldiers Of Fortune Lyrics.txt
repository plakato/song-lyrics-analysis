Soldiers Of Fortune Lyrics
by Running Wild.

We're taking the gain of the fair winds.
Fortuna right on our side.
We take the waves of our destiny.
To escape just every plight.

Howling winds are calling right from eternity.
A promise to be hold - the longing to be free.

Soldiers of fortune daring the seven seas of fate.
Any risky venture's daily in our trade.
Soldiers of fortune travel the winds of space and time.
And the timing should be right when we're about to die.

We're sliding into the fogbank.
Hiding there waiting our terms.
The routine of pure piracy.
Make big eyes - see and learn.

Howling winds are calling right from eternity.
A promise to be hold - the longing to be free.

Soldiers of fortune daring the seven seas of fate.
Any risky venture's daily in our trade.
Soldiers of fortune travel the winds of space and time.
And the timing should be right when we're about to die.

Howling winds are calling right from eternity.
A promise to be hold - the longing to be free.

Soldiers of fortune daring the seven seas of fate.
Any risky venture's daily in our trade.
Soldiers of fortune travel the winds of space and time.
And the timing should be right when we're about to die.

Soldiers of fortune independence is our law.
We're drifting with the wind to unknown shores.
Soldiers of fortune just entangled with the sea.
The daring riffs and waves determine our destiny.
