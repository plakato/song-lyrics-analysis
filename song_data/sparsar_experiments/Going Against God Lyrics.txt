Going Against God Lyrics
by The Underachievers.


Niggas talk a lot of shit bout the shit they ain't got.
Keep on talking, then we pull on his block.
Trinidad Don't believe me just watch.
Told my nigga Powers “Raise it a notch”.
Speakers booming, nigga break up the box.
Fuck a bitch, really only want top.
Yeah I got my chopper, keep it for cops.
Nigga rising I know.
Hit the finest hydro.
Nigga ride for that coast.
Multiplying my hoes.
Make her hit the high notes.
Woah woah.
Hitting gas and I flow.
Give me wings and I coast.
Getting wings and I boast.
Fuck your bitch off my post.
Instagram got them hoes.
Go god, and my partner young Gohan ..
Pump your breaks, you better slow down.
And your bitch 0 to 60 just like the cortarc.
2Pac enter my heart my niggas won't stop.
Till they pull up at me like 50 I bet I won't drop.
Nigga moving the city the city spitting like cobra.
Niggas chasing millions like Diddy but never sold.
Niggas look stupid its silly going against god.

Going against God.
Going against God.
Going against God.

Leave it to me and I gladly deliver.
She Snapchat that pussy same night I was in her.
Sinners insane double S, Super Saiyan.
Till mills on my.
bank I go hard like the pavement.
Hibernate like.
caveman.
Hyperbolic training.
Hop out off the booth, its burning, Usher Raymond.
With the Kunta Kinte, your bitch call me sensei.
If its not Blue faces I do not comprendé.
I'm a comma chaser, no pause in my statement.
As-salamu alaykum, no beef for your ?
The throne looking vacant so AK reclaim it.
Hella weed and hail ain't get me through the fakeness.
I don't even practice, AI with the talents.
When I grip the mic I'm Jackie with the talents.
Man truth never told unless I was the narrator.
Average ass rappers we treat you like scavengers.
Don't get Meek Millied invincible.
Troy, we pop at your Achilles.
Can't fuck with the normal popping in your city.
You sold 50 albums tryna be like 50.
My nigga like really.
On a bigger better things that be the coast.
Summer 16 belonging to the coast.
Flatbush raised me baby, teeth be full with gold.
Flag be on the.
left Im repping for the low.
Yeah we fresh to death you niggas can't indulge.
The Mary gang I pay your rent with my clothes.
Just be shining gold it's a magnet for hoes.
AK might erupt I spit nightmares with flows.
Kobe call me clutch I dig into her guts.
Tell me I'm a genius g the bat at up.
Pick her out.
like Gina she don't get no cloth.
Thinking how.
I leave them.
going against the Gods.

Going against God.
Going against God.
Going against God.
