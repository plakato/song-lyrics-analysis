Gangsta Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


I started small time, choke game cocaine, 
Pushing rocks on the block, I'm never broke. Mayn 3x 
I started small time, choke game, cocaine 
Damn. It feels good to be a gangsta 
, 
Lil', Keke, 
Purple drank wet paint, fired up, let it stank 
65. In the tank. Half a mill in the bank 
Drop dog butter, guts scratching on them, 84's 
Cadillac ass down, I'ma slam it on the note, 
All star heavy buck, I'ma cop twenty trucks, 
Call twenty homies tell em, go to lot and pick em up 
I'ma slide in the ride. Do'S popped suicide, 
Chop cut fresh buck trunk popped, real wide, 
Representing, Southside, swanging and banging 
84's twisting TV's raining 
I'ma. Let em see the hood floating by holding wood 
Haters on the sideline know a playa looking good 
Ever since I came out two heaters in the spot. 
Cheaters know they bet not try to set a road block. 
 Got ta stay true in the street 
I hustle real hard. The whole team got ta eat, 
, 
Scarface 
I got a bag in my pocket, weighing least a grand 
Eight balls quarter, ounces, half-a-ki's and slabs 
Want a cook I can cook for ya soft, come with it 
4-50 on a ounce. If you want it, come get it 
You a smoker. By flip it you can smoke for free, 
Let. The whole hood know that they can sco' it from me. 
I'M the dope man dope, man, blue jeans, sagging 
T-shirt Chuck's on blue rag. Wearing 
I don't give a fuck homes, laws keep staring 
But, they can get the fuck on cause. I'M not sharing 
Block bleeding till my heart: stop mama at home, 
She ain't working! So my neighborhood keeping me on 
I'm a young nigga old one. I worship the grind! 
And, if I ever got jammed fuck it give me my time. 
Cause I'ma be a big time: cocaine, slanger, 
, 
Coota, Bang 
Yes. Indeed I confess I'm blessed with G's 
Bloodline from my grandpa Jerney Lee 
On D-block with Eye G, see Bulldog 
Not, just the rapper dude. Really hood dog 
Compact nine millimeter in my pocket, 
So watch it. If you talking sideways, are watching 
Or an object, go upside, your noggin 
17-0-3 military clocking 
I'm out that Manner. We mobbing 
My relatives sleep. We robbing 
I'm low key kitchen in the process. 
If you's a hustler you picked up and caught that 
Swishahouse down South, where the Nawf at 
What's really hood homeboy, where you mouth at 
Held down like a ankle on my ankle, 
 gangsta,
