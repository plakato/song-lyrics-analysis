Gangsta Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


I started small time, choke game cocaine.
Pushing rocks on the block, I'm never broke mayn - 3x.
I started small time, choke game cocaine.
Damn it feels good, to be a gangsta.

Lil' Keke.
Purple drank wet paint, fired up let it stank.
65 in the tank, half a mill in the bank.
Drop dog butter guts, scratching on them 84's.
Cadillac ass down, I'ma slam it on the note.
All star heavy buck, I'ma cop twenty trucks.
Call twenty homies, tell em go to lot and pick em up.
I'ma slide in the ride, do's popped suicide.
Chop cut fresh buck, trunk popped real wide.
Representing Southside, swanging and banging.
84's twisting, TV's raining.
I'ma let em see the hood, floating by holding wood.
Haters on the sideline, know a playa looking good.
Ever since I came out, two heaters in the spot.
Cheaters know they bet not, try to set a road block.
Gotta stay true, in the street.
I hustle real hard, the whole team gotta eat.

Scarface.
I got a bag in my pocket, weighing least a grand.
Eight balls quarter ounces, half-a-ki's and slabs.
Want a cook I can cook for ya, soft come with it.
4-50 on a ounce, if you want it come get it.
You a smoker by flip it, you can smoke for free.
Let the whole hood know, that they can sco' it from me.
I'm the dope man dope man, blue jeans sagging.
T-shirt Chuck's on, blue rag wearing.
I don't give a fuck homes, laws keep staring.
But they can get the fuck on, cause I'm not sharing.
Block bleeding till my heart stop, mama at home.
She ain't working, so my neighborhood keeping me on.
I'm a young nigga old one, I worship the grind.
And if I ever got jammed, fuck it give me my time.
Cause I'ma be a big time, cocaine slanger.

Coota Bang.
Yes indeed, I confess I'm blessed with G's.
Bloodline from my grandpa, Jerney Lee.
On D-block, with Eye G see Bulldog.
Not just the rapper, dude really hood dog.
Compact nine millimeter, in my pocket.
So watch it if you talking, sideways are watching.
Or an object, go upside your noggin.
17-0-3, military clocking.
I'm out that Manner, we mobbing.
My relatives sleep, we robbing.
I'm low key, kitchen in the process.
If you's a hustler, you picked up and caught that.
Swishahouse down South, where the Nawf at.
What's really hood homeboy, where you mouth at.
Held down, like a ankle on my ankle.
, gangsta.
