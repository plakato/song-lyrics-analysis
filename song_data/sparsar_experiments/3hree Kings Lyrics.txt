3hree Kings Lyrics
by The Underachievers.


I got 7 mac 11's, it's a 147 on any peasant.
With a stone cold vengance will get ya brethren.
This the daily routine chase dreams and scoop cream.
But of course this broke niggas wanna get in between.
So i keep my eye wide on the New York crime side.
It's 33 reasons why i'm just too fly.
My aura stay beaming indigo blue feeding off ya soul.
Fool beating off the pro tools ahh.
Do what i gotta till my crew hold a lotta ones.
Momma see what i become shining on the world her son.
Told me i would be the one way before neyo.
You niggas ain't believe though now i'm bombing like my weed smoke bitch!

Smoking on this loosie still elegant like a 2 piece.
Mister writing on my iPhone i stuffed my pockets with lose leafs.
Like loose leaves fall in autumn i turn the clock never stalled em.
Spit fire like we some sawyers they look they never saw us.
I'm painting let me do my thang yo type always bend a name or 2 that i'm 7.
chains.
Bumping they music will leave stupid like heroin rather medicine.
That's to eat that proper sediment for better man.
Like a black hearse we lead and we stay ahead of them.
Edison the way the light bulbs on my head they shimmering.
If yo shit ain't lit you ain't using yo head severit.
Shoutout for the battle but none of these niggas helmets fit ughh!
You unprepared homie you need my messages.
My flow like walking on stilts giving niggas that leverage dropping gems and.
shit.
Filled up inside of my penmanship peep the redder it.
We make new rules like we presidents.
I'm tryna win but in the process of a better man.
Who you better than? never me nigga i got synonym.
Stay anonymous only few niggas conspire with.
Spitting higher shit that boom bap lyrical scientist.
People trying it tell em conquer their whole environment.
Yo tv lying man flip egg brain and they frying it.
Devine, illuminated fire spinning 3 eyes.
Creating my reality since a nigga was knee high.

See i, come through and always handle my B.I.
Rock split life after death shouts to B.I.
G.I Puppies up in heavens with the angels.
Leave them niggas on ankles sting them niggas like a bee hive.
We are street kings similar to T.I.
We are 3 kings gifted on the M.I.
C.I see why niggas hate cuz we up.
Mad as shit cuz they down.
I would hate to be y'all.
My gun would make you revolve.
I got 8, 38's increase the murder rates.
I send niggas to pearly gates.
I Know magic my gun would make you levitate.
Hit you with the shotty catch a body then we celebrate.
