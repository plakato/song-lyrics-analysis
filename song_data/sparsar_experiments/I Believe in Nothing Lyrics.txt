I Believe in Nothing Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

Drove down the road 1000 times.
But once more wouldn't make you mine.
So what do I care if you ever leave?

Cause I believe and I believe in nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing, nothing, nothing.

I have important things to say.
You wouldn't listen anyway.
Cause you only wanna girl who wants to leave.

So I believe and I believe in nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing, nothing, nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing, nothing, nothing.

Drove down the road 1000 times.
But once more wouldn't make you mine.
So what do I care if you ever leave?

Cause I believe and I believe in nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing.
I believe and I believe in nothing.
