Behind The Mirror Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Visions - I'm not awake - nor do I sleep.
Dreamin' dawn turns to dusk.
Dwarves and fairies dance on my grave.
There's a door to - wonderland.

Fires, see fires darken the night.
Brightness, dark brightness.
Trapped in a hot air balloon.

I can't believe it.
But I believe it's true.

There's a shark.
Climbing thru' my heart.

Stars shine when the moon heat.
Cools my thoughts.
The still of the night is so noisy.

All faked or true.
Tell me - what I will see.
Is there a new world.
To be found - behind the mirror.

Wake up - open me eyes.
Light a cigarette and smoke.
Smell the taste of coffee.
Am I back to wonderland?
