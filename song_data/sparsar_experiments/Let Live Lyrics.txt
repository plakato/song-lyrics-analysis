Let Live Lyrics

“Let Live” by Unified Giants.

You are now listening.
To KEI-SHON-SON… Broadcasting …Worldwide.

I spend a lot time chasing girls.
While steady having fun.
And yet and still I'm missing out…
Yeah, like what is this about.
When I take a look.
I'm proud to close the book…
Knowing knowledge been took.
And now I spend a lot of time chasing better worlds…
Them better worlds…
They come with them better girls.
And no lie… I keep them squirreled up in a tree.
That soft fur keep them squirrelling for me.
With no money… never thinking GOD is mad at me.
You say its blaspheme, I say reality…
I get it magically.
Girl I get it magically…
Ok I lied it was that increase in salary.
And then them haters know…
That's why they mad at me.
But I'm humbled by it…
Knowing that it had to be.
Cause giving up now…
Will probably be… the world's greatest tragedy.

Cause life around is getting bad…
Been bad enough.
And yet I'm good…
Knowing good ain't good enough.
I hustle hard on the hunt for another buck.
I'm trynna eat …
I really ain't ate enough.

And so I…
Just live and let live.
No matter what…
No matter what I.
Just live and let live.
And it was all good just a week ago.

I spend a lot of time chasing better jobs…
So many interviews.
Right on top… of so many calls…
I've seen so many stall.
While I steady kept it pushing…
Up in a newer car thinking that I like the cushion.
Bout as much as a dime and the steady smushing.

I get to booking for the border when the bell rings.
That's how I'm feeling now…
That's how I'm gonna eat.
Now even tricks thinking I'm gone treat…
I'm in the streets like I'm Gandhi number 3.
Up on top trynna understand what's over me.
I show consistency…
Year round Cali heat.
I barely speak if it ain't on beats.
Still in the streets sowing seeds of peace…
Now come' on … come' on.

Cause life around is getting bad…
Been bad enough.
And yet I'm good…
Knowing good ain't good enough.
I hustle hard on the hunt for another buck.
I'm trynna eat …
I really ain't ate enough.

And so I…
Just live and let live.
No matter what…
No matter what I.
Just live and let live.
And it was all good just a week ago.

Cause life around is getting bad…
Been bad enough.
And yet I'm good…
Knowing good ain't good enough.
I hustle hard on the hunt for another buck.
I'm trynna eat …
I really ain't ate enough.

And so I…
Just live and let live.
No matter what…
No matter what I.
Just live and let live.
And it was all good just a week ago.
