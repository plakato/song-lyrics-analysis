Stun Gun Lyrics
by Quarashi.

Tiny.
Ayo this shit doesn't come easy.
Hey don't misjudge me.
Whatever might displease you.
Still couldn't touch me.
I don't care what I write is what I'm gonna bust.
Fights on round one, if you fuck with anyone of us.
What? Please, you better run 'til your knees concede.
Shit hits the fan next time you see me.
And I don't stall about what's up with ya'll.
Now freeze, on the spot when it's time to let it all out.
And I don't know, I just don't know.
Why things always get little bit out of control.
Why people get rowdy when I come into the place.
Whoops, there goes my glass in your face.

One time for my posse.
Two time for my homes.
We'll be chilling in the backseat.
Where we bury the bone.

Tiny.
Here's a birdie who plays dirty in this game.
It's a shame that my ex wants to act this way.
What a hag, man, what a bunch of crap to say.
When I've been nothing but fair with you up 'til this day.
But hey, you got what you wanted so choke on this shit, too.
You got issues.
Why you think I broke up with you?
Dammit, can't you see I don't need this crap?
I can't believe this, bitch, give me my CD's back!
Infact how's that for a turn on.
For your ugly ass and a face I wouldn't even shoot  on.
I'll tell you this much, you really got me pissed off.
You flat-chested bitch.
You really thought I went this soft?
I tried to be nice.
But if all you want is beef, then.
A word of advice so you can sink your teeth in.
I can be your bearer.
Of ill rotten blues.
When you disregard me this way.
I bring bad news.

One time for my posse.
Two time for my homes.
We'll be chilling in the backseat.
Where we bury the bone.

One time for my posse.
Two time for my homes.
We'll be chilling in the backseat.
Where we bury the bone.

Tiny.
My experience is limited.
Reputation is discredited.
The locals read it man.
I have to live here.
Please edit it.
You can type that I'm quite nice if they buy it.
I like my weekends private.
Real peaceful and quiet.
I don't condone violence.
Read books for recreation.
I interfere with politics and.
Public relations.
So put that in your piece.
And a lid on it please.
Doesn't matter if you bend the truth a little bit, see?
Next time I'm in the studio.
I'll take my grudges out.
And you can get the clean version sent to your house.
This is my scene now, and I'm a crate for more.
'Til the world breaks.
What the fuck you take me for?

One time for my posse.
Two time for my homes.
We'll be chilling in the backseat.
Where we bury the bone.
