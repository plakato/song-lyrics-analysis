Make It Snow Lyrics
by Tyler Carter.

New York City at this time of year never felt so hard to breathe.
Got my eggnog and Henny and a little Christmas cheer.
Baby ima start the fire wait right here.

You can call me jack frost when I send shivers up your spine.
I'm sorry for being naughty let me make up for lost time.
Those dimples in ya back both need a kiss kiss.
I wanna give you everything on ya wishlist.
Hold ya body, post up, making snow angels in a blanket of love.

Make it snow cause we've been so cold make it snow.
Baby we got all of the lights down low, Let it snow.

Set the mood red green blue lights is blinking on the tree while I'm getting.
close to you burning candles meanwhile every time I hit that spot that you.
can't handle I'm making it snow.
I see the mistletoe is hanging and the Christmas bells is clanging.
St. Nick on the roof, TC in the booth, and we got these cookies baking, just.
like the songs I'm making, I deliver, that's why your shaking shake shaking.
shiver.

The weather outside is frightful and this snow is so delightful so let it snow.
