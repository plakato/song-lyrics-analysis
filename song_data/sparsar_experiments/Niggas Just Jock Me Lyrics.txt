Niggas Just Jock Me Lyrics
by 415.


Niggas just jock me, they try to clock me.
I ain't havin that cause I'm the L to the o, the c.
I'm not weak or soft like a geek.
I'm a mack to the world as if I was Goldie.
Brothers need to know exactly where I'm comin from.
I knock a nigga out the box like a champion.
Won't give a fuck if you duck and try to miss one.
I come again with the pump shotgun.
A bitch tried to diss, excuse me, miss.
I'm D muthafuckin Loc, I don't give a shit.
About yo nigga, I pull the trigger on his ass.
Spit on the punk, then laugh.
Yo, another day, another nigga, what the fuck.
One mo' sucker to bite the dust.
Now I'm on a gangster tip, straight ruthless.
Wanted by the police for killin up a trooper.
You gotta catch me to arrest me.
Cause yo, I hold a grudge on a nigga with a billy club.
I'ma die hard, that's my job.
To straighten out niggas that try to get what I got.
They don't understand what I'm sayin, man.
Mister police, niggas just jock me.

Deion's the name that was given to me.
But I'm D-Loc when I chill with the posse.
Show respect to a brother that's a mack.
And if you don't, me and the homies'll just rat pack.
Muthafuckas know Loc is on a rampage.
You better duck when I bust my 12-guage.
I might move on a fool with a small gat.
Lounge in the cut, catch him slippin, then jack.
Now I just came up like a genius.
Fat Benzo with vogues and zeniths.
Hit the strip, slammin 'Groupie Ass Bitch'.
See all the hoes lookin, it's time to get pussy.
Hey cutie, you right there.
Tell your friend behind you to come over here.
And get with a real man, stop playin with a punk.
Only chumps drive mini trucks.
You got a feelin, boy? Don't sleep.
You feel like a frog? Then leap.
Hah, step to me if you want to.
But be sure that you got a attitude.
And a Uzi to back you.
Niggas don't trip when I shoot gift.
Mister police, niggas just jock me.

I'm from the Oakland streets, there's no peace.
The 415 don't jive, we take lives, see?
You might think you can get with me.
But Daryl's in the back with a sub-machine.
Niggas get offended when I play this.
But you gotta give me credit cause I'm so dedicated.
I don't front, this is from the heart, punk.
He that disagrees, D-Loc will just stomp.
That's the routine, I don't give a fuck.
Niggas jock, cause that's the name of this cut.
So I expect that from young comrades.
They get mad but they can't do shit about it.
Goin out like suckers, stupid muthafuckas got dicks.
But they cry like bitches or snitches.
Or 'Snitches &amp; Bitches', yo.

But they don't really get what we're sayin, Rich.
Mister police, niggas just jock me.

Duck, you pigeon, peckin like a chicken.
Snakin on a brother cause I'm doggin yo bitches.
I'm not as big as you, so you think that you.
Can fuck over me, but you're wack cause I'm strapped.
I always pack a nine, you know.
5'7, a one-man Rambo.
If I can't handle, in other words a double team.
I step off, then step back with a posse.
What comes next, a one-round beatdown.
To the street ???? in the Oaktown.
Who called the police? Must be punks.
The same young bucks that was fuckin with us.
Cowards don't live long, you gotta be strong.
If you wanna be in the game and wrong.
Now I'm on a mission, sippin Olde English.
Feelin tipsy cause my head is kinda spinnin.
But I ain't towed down yet, just wait.
I'm finna act a fool when I hit the dank.
So you better step off when I'm comin through, boss.
And watch your back before you take a loss.
But niggas don't trip when I shoot gift.
Mister police, niggas just jock me.
