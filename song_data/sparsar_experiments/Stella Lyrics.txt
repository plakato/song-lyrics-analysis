Stella Lyrics
by Wu Block.

.
Stay dip, cute bitch out in Delaware, moving our bricks.
So hard, stupid big stones from Miss.
Stella ear.
She just turn 35, we in the spot on Martin Luther King Drive.
Whole team getting high, on phones.
We learned different codes of pig Latin.
So the jakes don't follow our trail with sick patterns.
And the crib is jig, Jennifer convertible love seat.
That's worth forty G's from Madrid.
In Spain, sipping cherry Cosmo's and things.
Stella, finish the glass, showing niggas her rings.
I said bitch, I ain't impressed with that.
Why the fuck is every briefcase short by at least ten stacks.
We had a mil' in each bag, there's eighty grand missing.
You pop up with a new Jag', with a bad system.
I done sent your ass to Hawaii and Waikiki.
When your man needed bail, you'll come see me.
Rob me? That's how we do? You pretty slick muthafucka.
You must think I'm a sucker.
Matter fact, you gon' suck this dick, how bout that for a change.
Let me see what's really on your brain.
She said â€˜Starkey, you violating me, stop it'.
I saved up for this shit, you playing me like a hostage.
Out of all people, I wheeled you around, when you got shot.
Be the closest one too you, and may I rot.
In hell, yo Starks, chill, I don't think she that stupid.
Since '90, '95, she came through, kid.
Two million in six weeks, cover six space.
Just to think of those towns alone, we brought a big steak.
.
But it still don't change the job.
Aiyo, Tone, who this silly bitch trynna rob.
Niggas been getting money, since pushing a Saeb.
In the spot writing rhymes, never heard of a blog.
Is it that coincidental? That the same rental.
Be out in Virginia and DC, before she come see me.
I'm ready, put this hammer in her face in 3D.
I know that's your home girl, but fuck it, on GP.
And I don't like her brother, either, he probably put her up to it.
Give me the word and I go empty his fluid.
Shady? I been bagging up since 1980.
Me and Ghost been tight, since Fred met Grady, lady.
So what you telling me? My account is off?.
Oh you must really motherfucking think we that damn soft.
.
Hold on, yo, Sheek, what you gon' do? Cut her whole hand off?.
Put a pillow over her face, and let the four bang off?.
Or we can get the gat taping so the ho can't talk.
Before we get the whole story cut this whole thing short.
I don't think that's wise at all, whatever honey do with her money, dog.
That's not my problem, why is it yours?.
Wu-Block, you riding for mine, I'm riding for yours.
That's the motto if you talking bout homicide, my lord.
It's survival, homey, you ain't never lied, my lord.
But the Pretty Toney baby ain't never lied before.
That's a hundred lucci, word to Bully, I smoke too many loosies.
I know her history, if something fishy, must be the coochie.
It ain't no mystery, your finger itchy, if she a groupie.
Once you go up, once you go down, let's keep it Gucci.
You take her head, I take all the jewelry from all these moolies.
Get all your goonies, and we can meet up for Call of Duty.
Ain't nothing funny like Paul Mooney, this fatal beauty.
Got some explaining to do, hold up, I thought you knew me.
Better than that, we know the cheddar was tapped.
You getting bread in the trap, why get in bed with them rats.
My son is missing some racks, and Louch is fitting to snap.
She need to come up with answers, instead of fixing her mack.
Makeup, just give the facts, straight up, and just the facts.
If you did it, we gon' bury you with it, and that's that.
