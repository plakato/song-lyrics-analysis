Celebrate Lyrics
by Unity Klan.

Big J.
My Chirst was slain, so I'll never forget.
Never quit never forfeit my benefit.
Makin it a permit desicion for my flesh to submit.
When you got 5 I got the whole kingdom on it.
You can bet on it Im gonna celebrate.
Worship him right through pearly gates.
No matter what you or they have to say.
You can't stop the UK for praisin all through the day.
What yall think we was just gonna sit on Christ.
Keep him hush hush and live our life.
A personal encounter changed my life.
So I have to give praise to the Prince of Life.
Yo hands up put em up yo never give up.
We came wit the anointin to get my stuff.
We kings of the house we celebrate out.
Gideon through the nation yall a victory shout.

Jaz.
Hear the celebration roar throughout the kingdom.
My shackles broken so we got the freedom.
Its that time from jubilee 50 sabactically.
All hail Isreal lion on Zion reigns.
Generates the light from my eye.
Call down the fire like Elijah from the sky.
And celebrate let the praise penetrate the gate.
We came to rejoice halleluiah, one voice.
Praise the one that rides above the clouds and the sun.
March around the wall seven times Jerusalem.
When its all said and done, tell me who's I.
So I hoped you learned your lesson.
And confession with the Son.

Big J and Jaz.
I see Joseph in jail with adoration on his lips.
Sold as a slave to the nation of Egypt.
Equipt with celebration in the bottom of his soul.
Holdin on to patience his dreams soon unfold.
And when it unfolds behold promotion comes.
Even when you grow up in the bottom of the slump.
God gives and takes but through it all we celebrate.
It brings you back to an old story of faith.

Jaz.
Like Abraham he still God's friend.
Adam and Eve before time began.
David was his next of kin.

His grace and mercy we can't comprehend.
My praises they will never bend.

Big J.
Like Daniel and the lion's den.
Im going to keep on pressin in.
No matter where a brothers been.
Yo through his his blood I have been cleansed.
Im a soldier ready to fight.
Keep my spirit in Christ real tight.
One day, soon we take fight.
Celebrate in worship all through the night.
