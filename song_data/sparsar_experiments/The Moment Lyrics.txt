The Moment Lyrics
by Xc.


I'm on it, god damn it I'm on it Dee.
Yeah we in that presidential but hommie ain't nothing sweet.
Niggas got alot to say but I hearing nothing b.
I ain't worried bout the rest I don't even fucking sleep.
We only take fast breaks till everyone that run with me.
Balling, its only right thats the shit they wanna see.
And I just met her last night she think she in love with me.
Its crazy how shorty came and now she dont wanna leave.
Plus she such a freak she came back with one a piece.
Thats what I call 4 play and I promise I'm sucker free.
Heard they getting tired of us and I don't know bout much fatigue.
But we gon ball till we fall its like we in the summer league.

I'm on it, God damn it I'm on it.
They say its my time I tell em I know it.
First I fuck the world then I put my niggas on it.
Life's a bitch and now we run it and they know it.
This is the Life.
I'm on it, She tell me she want it.
I tell her I got it she tell me she know it.
They know that its are time and they wanna live in the moment.
Yeah we gone and she wanna know where we going.
I tell her slow down.

I'm on it, and you they gon hate.
When they chick trash and yours ain't got no waist.
Usually I don't chase I just sip that rose straight.
But if I'mma stab this white girl I'mma need some OJ.
Shorty 21 I told her don't play.
I said I was gon hit she thought I was gon stay.
I play the game right you tryna get on base.
And I already took em home ain't none of then hoes safe.
See thats old news niggas you can gon chase.
I already killed it tho now she just a cold case.
Asked em if they like girls you know what they gon say.
Cause when you on the road to riches them bitches go both ways.

I'm On It God Damn it I'm on it x3.
Lifes a bitch and now we run it and they know it.
This Is The Life.

I swear I live a fast life, Just pray that I don't crash right.
And we did it last night, Just like it was our last night.
I must got bad sight Haters I don't see them.
Man she ain't even got no kids and he say that's his BM.
And she hit me on twitter talking bout I'm boutta leave him.
Man I don't even follow her how she send me a DM.
From AM to the PM I feel like muthafucka break.
I been riding so long I should switch my fucking plates.
But I'm eating good I just got a couple steaks.
Just for me and whats her face, Its hard to keep up with names.
When you with a different woman every other day.
Just heard my brother say, Pump ya breaks.
But I can't stop now.
