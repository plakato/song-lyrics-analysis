Dream The Dare Lyrics
by Pure Bathing Culture.

Tell me golden ocean love
Hopeless, but adored
Sea-slick symboled wants for more
He draws. The Raven's card

Give me forward. Motion love
Seas of white unfold
Sky's black servant, divinate
Show us what you hold

Window watcher. I want ya, come on
Oh love. Are you mine
Those feathered lashes, you're, hiding behind
Does it catch in your chest? 
Do you like what you find 
Don't. You know, I think about it. All of the time

Diamond islands in your eyes
Blackest in the sun
Ancient watcher divinate
You're, the only one

Window watcher. I want ya, come on
Oh love. Are you mine
Those feathered lashes, you're, hiding behind
Does it catch in your chest? 
Do you like what you find 
Don't. You know I think about it. All of the time

Window watcher. I want ya, come on
Oh love. Are you kind
Those withered words that ring in your mind
Does it catch in your chest
Do? You like what you find
Window watcher. I want ya

To feel water
To feel fire
To feel water

Window watcher. I want ya. Come on a
Oh love. Are you mine
Those feathered lashes, you're, hiding behind
Does it catch in your chest? 
Do you like what you find 
Window watcher. I want ya, come down and be mine

Little watcher come closer. I need ya
Oh love. Are you kind
Those withered words that ring in your mind
Does it catch in your chest
Do? You like what you see
Is it all. What you want it want it to be

Come down storm crow from your window
Come down storm crow, find your way. Home!
