Giles Lyrics
by Unearth.

Smother his life-the words cut right to the heart.
Disease and threaten my family name.
An epic stand is made.
Condemned I will not plead.

Damned to the beast of torment.
Damned by the beast within us all.

Crushed by the fear.
More stone, more stone.
More weigh for corey.

Not one step forth could capture amission of guilt.
By law, avoids death on gallows hill.
Through time his fight will martyr my name.
My soul free of a heretic.

Court of ayer and terminer.
Leave me my rightful land.
Court of ayer and terminer.
Leave me my rightful land.

To stow in my heart-to leave to my sons.
Peine forte et dure is called-.
An effort to collapse belief.
Has failed, and surely will die with me.

Rectify my name.
