Lyrics to You Know What It Is feat. KD Aubert.

Fought it like a killer bee.
Watch me how I kill this shit.
Can tell with what I'm working with.
... is my nourishment.
You know what it is.
Money my curse.
... embarrass me.
Like they wanna honor me.
They ain't got to honor me.
I ain't got to honor bitch.
... you know what it is.
Now I'm getting all of it.

... the way she shakes that ass.
You know what it is.
It's my swag.
My....
My car.
The money.
It's the way I'm....
Make these beautiful bitches love me.
You know what it is.
It's the Burberry cologne spray.
... 15 miles... we ain't stopping until....

It's the black Gucci belt.
With the black Gucci....
You know what it is.
... murder it's all I got....
MÃ©nage a trois....

It's my diamonds....
I know they... on me like....
You know what it is.
... I'm innocent.
And my mouth still talks this shit.
... you know what it is.
