Bound 4 Da Reload Lyrics
by 67.


My gun's bound for the reload 
No money in the world can make me switch sides like Figo 
M, on my block. No recoil 
I'll bring down greens of kilo 
On a Friday night pack getting locked out on the strip like D-BO 
My gun's bound for the bound. The 
My gun's bound for the reload 
 
My gun's bound for the reload 
No money in the world can make me switch sides like Figo 
M on my block. No recoil 
I'll bring down greens of kilo 
On a Friday night pack getting locked out on the strip. Like D-BO 
My gun's bound for the bound the 
My gun's bound for the reload 
 
My gun's bound for the reload 
No money in the world can make me switch sides like Figo 
M on my block. No recoil 
I'll bring down greens of kilo 
On a Friday night pack getting locked out on the strip like D-BO 
My gun's bound for the bound the 
My gun's bound for the reload 
 
Oxide and Neutrino 
My gun bound for the reload 
Bro got brown like Nee-no 
Just did a plug for a kilo. 
Now got green, no see mo 
Young rich niggers like Migos 
Free legs, free Derollz, Free up my people, 
Six in the spin two in the brah man can't come to the six zone. 
We ring Trap. We trap mannadem move bricks on the brick phone 
Feds got my bro locks, them
