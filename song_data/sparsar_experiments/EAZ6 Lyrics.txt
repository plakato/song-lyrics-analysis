EAZ6 Lyrics
by 6lack.


Yea, yea, yea.

Re-re-remix killa for the niggas who don't know it I be posted on the east.
side east side.
Six on the way and I'm about to change the game, show them niggas how we ride.
we ride.
Know it's all love, but where the boy come from they put a gun between your.
peace sign. Fuh Fiya.
Zone six nigga you'll get killed for the buzz don't get caught up in the bee.
hive.
Oh no....
Forever....
I ain't seen nutin' better.
I took a break from atlanta, pretty weather came back around like a merry-go.
Simple fella but I want this shit forever.
We in here.
These rappers seasonal like a county fair.
I'm the original you're lookin' like a spare.
Boy you drop a hot song and be gone in a year.
Aw no....
What they wan' do.
Memory loss, well let me remind you.
That flow water like a fucking monsoon.
If I see her and I want her I might get your mom soon.
Now I'm your daddy forever.
Wordplay really clever.
That real shit 'imma slip her.
Now she my cinderella.
I want her 'imma cop her.
Yea 'imma buy her hella.
If she was down to earth.
Now her attitude pr-pr-pr-pr-propella.
Swing my way.
Girl I make every day feel like a friday.
It's the appetizer wait until the entre.
And I'll be god damned if I let you take some fucking food off of my plate.
Cause when I'm on a plane I be on the way.
And when I'm on the way she say Ã¡ndale.
Rollin' with my niggas tryna get a change.
Now we ran our bands up, I'm the one to blame....
