Black and Silver Lyrics
by Xandria.

I am amused.
You seem to love me.
But be reserved.
Before you huff me.
I'm used to winners.
I need the fame.
And if you touched me.
You'd be my shame.
Your childish dreams are all in vain.
To me your kind is all the same.
A starlit sky.
Of black and silver is my core.
My last goodbye.
Makes you want me even more.
For silver is my fame.
Black is my name.
I am a queen.
And if you creep.
I'll push my blade.
Still-water-deep.
I am a dream.
A fairy-tale.
Your endless quest.
Your holy grail.
Thanks so much for your confusion.
I will be your lost illusion.
Deep inside.
The silver shines as black as can be.
My disguise.
The wolf among the sheep, you want me.
To me your kind is all the same.
To me your kind is all the same.
