Braindead Lyrics
by Zomboy.

How to produce a club track today.
Just follow the instructions.
And you'll be an electronic music producer.
In no time.
Step number 1.
Open you crap software.
And import a Random loop.
Like this.
Now you need a phat ass drop.

Here comes the clap.

Phaat ass drop.
Military drums.
Don't forget some levels.
Now and then use the clash.
Snare drums can't get enough.
Okay now we need some phat distortion.
More distortion.
I said more distortion.
Time for another phat ass drop.
Make some noise with stadium hornes.
Take out the base drum.
Break down.
Hi hats.
Now it's the time for a brake.
Stop the beats.
Get some keys.
And call it melody.

Now add some vocal cuts.
Like this.
And one more phat ass drop.

Military drums.

Now create a facebook page.
And post this crap.
