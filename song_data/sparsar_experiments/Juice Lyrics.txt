Juice Lyrics
by Swish.


Nigga watch and get used to me.
These bitches they watching.
They know that I got it.
They love it, man.
I got 'em glued to me.
These parties.
These women.
These bottles.
These clothes.
This money.
Man that's nothing new to me.
Got your chick on my lap and she all in my ear going on about what she gon' do.
to me.
Shout out to Nasty.
That nigga be killing the game.
But then I got the.
Juice.

I got the juice.
My niggas they killas.
I run with them troops.
Put the drop on your head.
And they ready to shoot.
Ey nigga, we winning.
Who care about you?

I have an obsession with counting this money.
My goal is to have someone counting it for me.
A whip and a chain.
With a bitch that look foreign.
A chef that's gon' cook me a meal every morning.

Whoa.

Let a nigga breath.
The flow that I'm spittin'.
I do it with ease.
Check out the style.
Bitches loving my steeze.
I'm young and I'm handsome.
Plus I got the cheese.
I pray everyday.
I don't drop like the fees.
King of the game.
Bitches drop at my feet.
I'm the dude with the bars.
So shut up when I speak.
I'm flowing like lava.
That's infinite heat.
Now rock to the beat.

I come off as crazy.
I blame it on herbs.
I make it look easy.
I'm sick with the words.
I kill all these rappers.
I ride in a hearse.
Collecting their bodies.
To stuff 'em in dirt.
Fuck all ya'll feelings.
Hit right where it hurts.
Spit hot like the devil.
Run back to the church.
I only get better.

I'm a gift to the game.
But to them I'm a curse.

I'm not giving a fuck.
Roll up the reefer.
And pass me the blunt.
You know what it is.
When I'm up in the cut.
I thinks its my turn.
Shit this game is a slut.

Nigga watch and get used to me.
These bitches they watching.
They know that I got it.
They love it, man.
I got 'em glued to me.
These parties.
These women.
These bottles.
These clothes.
This money.
Man that's nothing new to me.
Got your chick on my lap and she all in my ear going on about what she gon' do.
to me.
