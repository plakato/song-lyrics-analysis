[[pbas 51.000; rate 150; volm +1.5]]in the bloody moon . 
Whistling for the road . 
The honest seen view . 
The longing . 
for home . 
were only alone . 
were good . 
the riders [[slnc 100; pbas 48.000; rate 150; volm +1.5]]not to lose . 
The farmer to the two . 
were [[slnc 100]][[pbas 50.000; rate 120; volm +2.5]]going past is [[pbas 38.000; rate 130; volm +1.5]]you[[slnc 200]] . 
stinging through the years . 
Oh day way seen . 
One buddy .

I see you next to me . 
Takes so alone . 
Its falling to a .

Its scent in existance .
