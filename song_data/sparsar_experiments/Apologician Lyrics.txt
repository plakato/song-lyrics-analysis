Apologician Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

Did you think you'd find what's left of me in another life, in another life?
You've had your chance, but you're going to hell.
Did you ever listen to the lies that you told me, that you told me?
It was meant for you, not me.

All this time you've stolen from me, now your blood will be washed away.
Now your end is my escape, my life was yours to take.
I can't feel anything but hate.
I wish you could be erased.
I can't feel anything but hate.
I wish you could be erased.

There won't be peace for those who betray.
Forever, eternal, you will all pay.
There won't be peace for those who betray.
I am the reaper, today is my day.

You've ruined my life, you've ruined my mind.
Close your mouth, your sins are spilling out.
Close your, your sins are spilling out.

Wipe off your grin, you make me fuckÂ´ing sick.
Wipe off your grin, you make me fucking sick.

There won't be peace for those who betray.
Forever, eternal, you will all pay.
There won't be peace for those who betray.
I am the reaper, today is my day.
There won't be peace for those who betray.
Forever, eternal, you will all pay.
There won't be peace for those who betray.
I am the reaper, today is my.

You're going to hell.
Did you ever listen to the lies that you told me, that you told me?
It was meant for you, not me.
