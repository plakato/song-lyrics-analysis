Auntie & Grandma Lyrics
by Z-Ro.


Special shouts out goes to.
My Aunt Sandra, and my Grandma Dorothy.
My two favorite girls, you dig these blues.

Z-Ro.
Coming up as a juvenile, 1983.
Had no idea, the Lord would take my mom away from me.
Cold part about it, I was only six when she died.
Aunt Sandra and Grandma Dorothy, wipe the tears from my eye.
Ever since I could remember, they've been guardian angels.
Whenever life started choking me, they would loosen up the strangle.
Wish I had a million dollas, I would hand it over.
So I could see my Auntie in a Bentley, and my Gram's in a Range Rover.
Who say, two women couldn't raise a man.
They did everything, except put a pistol inside my hand.
Taught me when to fight, and taught me when to walk away.
The main reason, why I'm not outlined in chalk today.
So many problems in my life, I'm glad they never left me lonely.
Much more than my Auntie and Grandmama, y'all my homies.
And can't nobody, ever take the place of my mama.
But raising me was hard, so I thank God for my.

Auntie and Grandmama.
When I thought I wouldn't make it they.
Brought me, through the drama.
I don't know, what I do without.
Auntie and Grandmama.
When I thought I wouldn't make it they.
Brought me through the drama.

Daddy was around, but he stayed gone.
Even when he was at home, he never stayed long.
He was in the street, so I raised myself.
Without his guidance he fell off, and almost played myself.
I got put out the house, and started living like a hobo.
Contemplating suicide, but Grandma said that was a no-no.
Then Auntie came and picked me up, and gave me some bread.
They gave me life, when everybody else done left me for dead.
I was in jail sometime, but they know I'm not a crook.
So they kept letters coming daily, and kept money on my books.
I thank the Lord for em, can't nobody take they places.
I just wanna make em happy, keep a smile on they faces.

For staying by my side, through all my hard times and tragedies.
Can't nobody, ever take the place of my mama.
But raising me was hard, so I thank God for my.

Z-Ro.
Even though I got love, for all my family members.
Only my two favorite girls, showed me love from December to December.
So I'm showing love back, it's the least I can do.
For being my parents, and seeing me through.
We always had a lot of love, in that household.
Didn't have a lot of food, but I never had to keep my mouth closed.
Always had something hot, on my plate.
A lot of times I was full, before my people even ate.
Aunt Sandra and Grandma Dorothy, y'all my blood for life.
Appreciate the way ya made sho' the word of God, touched me right.
Cause I'm a God-fearing man, till I'm in my grave.
Trying to make it to Heaven which y'all, no more sinning days.
If I had wishes to make, I would give em to y'all.
Because without your love, I would not be living at all.
Can't nobody, take the place of my mama.
But raising me was hard, so I thank God for my.
