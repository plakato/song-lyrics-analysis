Did It On Em Lyrics
by Quan Millz.

Listen, all you haters are my slaves.
I count fifthy thousand in the bank.
Soon as I get it in.
It ain't nothing changing. I always make em pray to god.
I turn em to a friend of mine.
All you trash talkers in the background laid off.
I might sign a couple digits in your celly.
When I'm paid off.
I ain't wasting time with these lames.
On the book I'm finna sign off.

I be on the notepad. It's almost like an iPad.
Writting lyrics in my notes, and I use it like a iPad.

I'm ahead of my game, Never faded, Never trippin.
Easy to make a million off a mixtape.
I'ma real hustla, I'm never slippin nigga.
I make it better while they busy making sextapes.

I ain't on a record deal.
Tell me how you niggas feel.
That straight on wordplay, is how these niggas kill.
I'm dropping 16-20 when they sign me on.
My first song should be a fucking hit, if they sign me on.

I'm on a mission to kill rappers, I'm not a murderer.
I will never stoop down to a hoe's level.
Carry aids, Bacteria.
I rather cuff a main chick like a cop arresting.
Drug addicts, Resisting to take a drug test.

You know what time it is, I guess I'm losing track of time.
These niggas say they cuffin but they never even seen the V.
Low Profile, Haters speaking in a back door.
I make enough money in a check, more than what you bargained for.
Tying Ratchet hoes in the bed, like a retarded whore.

It's time to say a prayer, Make a come up nigga.
I ate the beat It's said and done, I don't wanna say no more.
