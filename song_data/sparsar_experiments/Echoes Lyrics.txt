Echoes Lyrics
by Wolverine.

Without her precense my eyes tell lies to me.
And all those memories resound in my deranged and battered mind.
This suffocating illusion tears my mind.
And the remains of the truth.
Pictures of her wrapped in lust and craving arms of men.
The echoes of their pleasure run through my head.
She's led astray and fooled some way.
Again and again....
By specious smiles of those I wish were dead.
The warmth of laughter fills the night.
Then turn to echoes of eagerness, oh, it can't go on.
A fictive scenery unfolded in my eyes.
Are all these laughter and cries.
Created out of lies.
Oh, come take my hand.
I am lost without your guiding light.
And I need you to save me from darkness.
I will always be there for you.
I promise I'll stay.
Pictures of her wrapped in lust and craving arms of men.
The echoes of their pleasure run through my head.
I'm led astray and fooled some way.
Again and again....
By specious thoughts of mine I wish were dead.
