I Ride Lyrics
by 4th25.


I ride for these niggas.
I die for these niggas.
6,000 miles away.
Im takin fire with these niggas so.
Y'all wanna fuck around.
We can fuck around to.
Don't get 'em round 1.
Fuck 'em get 'em round 2.
Everybody's targets now.
Don't make us have to target you.
Fallen soldiers live forever.
We'll never remember you.

Look here.

This is for them soldiers.
That's not gon make it home.
So we go red in y'all memory.
Shoot 'em dead in y'all memory.

Engage em point blank in they face.
In y'all memory.
Cause for we leave best believe.
These iraq's will remember me.

Cause we are not fucking around here.
We don't get much sleep.
When we on the block all night.
Exchanging bullets for peace.

And once we start pullin' these triggers.
We don't stop.
Till the whole block leaks.
Till its not a live body in the streets.

Somebody should a toldem.
Soldiers don't know how to die easy.
And we are fittin' to get you back.
For them families that's now grieving.

So it el be a whole lot a fuckers.
In return that stop breathin'.
They should a laid down.
We wouldn't a had to kill 'em when we see 'em.

But they don't learn so quick.
So we keep havin' to teach 'em.
That the hungrier they get.
The more death we gonn feedom.

Until its over we ain't got no problem.
With more bodies.
That's just how we get down.
For them soldiers that served proudly.

They trying to see my body in the streets partner.
But that's not happenin'.
So for every bullet in my direction.
Im throwing 30 back at em.

And when the crew serves start poppin off.
Its no more questions.
These fuckers is meetin allah.
In a matter of seconds fuck 'em.

Losing my patience.
Maybe I've been here too long.
But y'all is fittin to pay me back.
For those soldiers not goin home.

Seen too many of us wounded.
I won't be the next one.
So the only Arabic im speakings.
Getting spoke thru this gun.

Y'all don't understand nothing else.
And y'all ain't tryng to talk neither.
You trying to win.
And you only score when a soldier stops breathing.

Only rules out this mo'fucker.
Don't get caught sleepin.
And when somethings poppin of.
Them triggers you got squeez 'em.

Cause they wanna see me gone.
But I am not leaving.
And at times.
I exercise this finger for no reason.

Keep these other mo'fuckers bleeding.
Rather them than me.
And god willing you fuckers.
Gon meet 'em before me.
