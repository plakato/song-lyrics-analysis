New Music Coming Soon Lyrics
by Tyler Tracey.


I, don't know if it's fate that chooses our path or if we do 
Either way, I'm up the river on a broken Sea. Doo 
You can jump and scream, but it's like they don't see. You 
Everyone got opinions, but none of them could be you 
Or. Be me I been in the shit. 
I'Ve sold drugs ran from cops. I been in the shit. 
I'Ve slept with loose women. I been in the bitch 
I cracked, my life early. Now it seems impossible to fix 
But. Give me that fix. I said give me that feeling 
Like I'm standing on top of the world standing on the ceiling, 
Feeling so good, but I'm suppose to be healing 
I said I was gon na sober up, but now I'm back to stealing 
I can't control myself any longer. 
Suicidal thoughts. Won'T stop now, I'm really starting to ponder 
I'll chop, another line and I'll pack, another bowl 
I'm losing my soul, but don't know ‘cause my mind's, a wander 
I been working so hard, but it ain't. Never enough. 
‘Cause. These bills aren't paid off off of art.
