IHustle Lyrics
by X.


Years past and still the younging at it.
Sky falling, catch it all, open handed.
Life's a bitch and I told her she need to play her part.
The games rigged so it's back to basics like restart.
Underground where the bars are forged in steel, where fiends be stealing,.
kids be doin the killings, where.
Dope, drank, dro, and pills be stored in the kitchen cabinet.
Right behind famo gripping that magnum.
Since rap erbody want in.
Wonder what it be like if I chose to never jumped in.
The world want a piece but won't give up an inch.
That's why I'm bout my green, like the fuckin grinch.
Thizzin' off the stench, my shooters off the bench.
Hanging with the team, call me willie Lynch.
All I know is grind til' I'm filthy rich.
All I know is grind til' I'm fucking rich.

I want money, cars, clothes, thots.
Drugs, planes, yachts.
I want money, cars, clothes, thots.
Drugs, planes, yachts.
So I hustle.
So I hustle.

Naw, I can't sit and chill.
Times so endangered, not much to kill.
Styrafoam dreams, can't afford to spill.
Money money money mo money for real.
Grinding all my life, what else is new.
Say I'm in it for the wrong reasons, but where was you.
Want me on your path, that path don't lead to mills.
Want me on your side, a side I don't feel.
It takes years for some to show they colors.
And I ain't speaking on flags, that's word to my mother.
Kain slew Abel I can't trust you bro'.
One deep til' I'm 6ft makin grass grow.
Shawty in my ear, she stay stroking my ego.
I know she'd up and ghost on me quickly for them c notes.
So all I know is grind until I'm filthy rich.
All I know is grind until I'm fucking rich!
