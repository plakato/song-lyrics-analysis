Call Everyone Lyrics
by Yuna.


Call everyone, call everyone.
And let them know.
I can't stand no more.

Call everyone, call everyone.
And let them know.
That I'm letting go.

People always thought we were strong.
But I knew it all along.
But I knew it all along.

You said you feel the pain.
Nothing's been the same.

And I look in your eyes.
I can see you're tired.

And I felt so lonely.
Give it all I've got.
