Close the Door Lyrics
by Rufus.

I'll ask you once.
Look in my eyes.
Is it gonna work.
Is my advice.

Have a little trust in me.
I love you.
Baby, can't you see'.
It's a lie and I don't care.

Have a little faith.
It's only fair.
That you trust in me.
I love you.

And you'll always be here.
A piece of my heart.
My peace of mind.
That's for sure.

'Til you close the door to giving.
To giving.
Don't call it quits.
It would be a shame.

Our little fits.
Would be to blame.
I'd give all of me.
And my precious time.

I'm not afraid to give.
And what's mine is mine.
I'll ask you once.
Look in my eyes.

Is it gonna work.
Is my advice.
Have a little trust in me.
I love you.

And you'll always be.
A piece of my heart.
My peace of mind.
That's for sure.

'Til you close the door to giving.
To giving.
'Til you close the door to giving.
