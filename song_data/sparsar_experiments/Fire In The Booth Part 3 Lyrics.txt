Fire In The Booth Part 3 Lyrics
by Akala.

Whoever's more human must have the right to do the abusing.
I imagine that means you then.
Or are you men just as clueless.
Foolish fools, thoughts of a tortured soul.
Bought for a quarter of gold.
One little sand nigger slaughter it whole.
Why not? They don't have souls.
They love their children less than we do so they are less than equal.
They abuse women so we kill them cos they are bloody villains.
That's right, we are the feminists.
For the women of the world, kill terrorists.
Liberate them from their burqas.
They feel more free with their children murdered.
I know that it sounds absurd but lemme explain it a little bit further.
We're so superior our missiles whistle until they tickle.
Little itty bitty grandchildren and make them giggle.
But their laughter sounds like screaming I told you that they were demons.

They pretend to be dead to make us feel sad.
Put bullets in their head to make us feel bad.
But we're never anything other than glad.
When those that look funny end up in a body bag.
But if a hair is harmed on Sally or Brad or.
Even a dog we cry like mad.
A dog is a man's best friend, not a girl.
Women are abused all over the world and children are raped.
Every place, every religion or creed or race.
Even fathers with daughters, uncles with nieces sweep it under the carpet.
Rape is a weapon used by power, and we don't wanna look like bastards.
So manufacture hero complex, a reaction to nuttin' more complex.
To organise mass rape in a state, don't wanna hear about mass graves.
Cos I hate to relate to a shade that's darker than you.
One that prays under a different roof.
Has less dollars or pounds, crowns or gowns or crowns.
Fill 'em up with rounds.
If they mess with the way that things are constructed.
Obstructing lines of production.
You can buy anything, liposuction, seduction, just buy it from us, men.

Buy lies, can't buy truth.
No-one's selling it there is no use.
There is no customer base for the product.
We'd rather buy some celebrity trollop.
Cos our life is about getting one-up.
On everybody else that we pass on a come up.
We don't care what force bring the sun up.
But lie in the sun every day gettin' bun up.
Lie to the point that it's part of the culture.
Tell the truth it's only the result of.
A double lie.
Cancelling itself, their.
pride cancer in itself.
Cos virus is normality living in a world that is built on vanity.
More salaries, more calories, more thieving, more charities.
Picture a Moor on a horse with a chariot speaking some kind of African Arabic.
Teaching mathematics with Spaniard when maths had not got to Britannia.

Can you picture mind scripture.
Thats designed for the mind to enrich you.
Are you blind can't you find the riddim pratt?
Cause your timing alignment is on crack.
It's hard to be as far off the rhythm as you are, it's like art.
Hard to have so little charisma, I swear that you try to be shit.
To make me look even better than.
Everybody knows that I am already.
I'm a pedigree that can't be touched like leprosy.
Have a rapper like The Beatles begging me to let it be.
And I don't need no referee.
I play the game on my own, it's my own sport.
And you can't take a king to his own court.
You can't take a king to his own court.
You ain't the throne sort.
You're the type to rap for five minutes.
And complain your throat's sore.
While I'm so sure that my stone jaw.
Is the coldest on road since '04.
But these silly little boys think their so raw.
Make a bigger bit a noise but we know you're.

You ain't up the game, you ain't match fit.
You ain't even got the brain for the tactics.
You ain't even on the bench you're a ballboy.
One lickle send out yout so just sit down.
I am the Big Mic man with the crown.
Super cat de pon sting with the sound.
Who are these silly little.
Wollies?
Think they erupt with enough of the guts to be on it.
Their the version of me that I didn't wanna be.
I'm the coldest I wrote since Admiral Zheng He.
I'm the fire in the booth, you a wet rag.
You ain't the real ting like a step-dad.
I'm the best so rest where the rest have.
Don't big up your chest, let your breasts sag.
I'm the best dad look, I don't even beat my sons.
I let them shine.
Even when they got no talent to rhyme.
Insist on doing it all of the time.
All of my spine is re-enforced with a kind.
Of carbon that hardens.
the thoughts in my mind.
Of course you will find that I torture a line.
I'm born with bars, no-one ever taught me to rhyme.
The portion that's mine, don't touch it.
Furthermore, don't even discuss it.
I know that you heard.

Britain's biggest export is weapons of death.
That ain't a theory or a guess.
Take another breath and your country is next.
Unless you remind 'em whenever you're rhyming.
You're a beast on the mic with impeccable timing.
They will think you're in the league that I'm in.
But that is most absurd.

I Turn a Stanza to a cancer with banter.
For those between the gangster and a panther.
I know you seen me these man dem with their tantrums.
Like kids when I'm off on a tandem.
Cos they don't know what a tandem means.
So rather than use a dictionary they talk shit and badmouth me.
When I'm only tryina elevate your mind, G.
But I don't watch that the love is more than a grands worth.
You should see when I roll through Handsworth.
Elders see me, cross the road, talk to me and it usually goes.
We love how you bus up da ting, spread knowledge.
Bunfire pon them Babylon college.
We salute you, you're the future.
All the bigger man have time for them yout deh.
What I'm saying it that the respect's worth.
More than the chain on your neck.
When it's not that it's somebody's mum.
Saying that she feed me to her son.
Cos she wanna come get his mind out of the slums.
Akala is smarter than Arthur your dumb.
Regardless the bars are retiredly dumb.
What the raises and the raated a part of my lung.

Take out a whole clique.
that chat's do do.
Pic up a mic, we can see who's who.
I'm fire in the booth, you dry wood.
Your flesh best taste quite good.
So smart but he still move quite hood.
See him on the road but don't think that I try should.
That's a wise assessment, kind of like land is a wise investment.
Especially land that's recently blessed with.
In excess of one million deaths in.
And the castle you rest in, that's a next ting.
Built on the bones and the flesh of the wretched.
Throne that you pose in, only protected.
Cos we regret that only deceptive.
Things that we like, and only reject it.
When it feels like it's truth were digesting.
So.
Get in with a blessed king.
Whose crown is the rounds that he fought.
Therefore you ain't gotta deal with the fraud.
Of all these picanees of whom I'm bored.

My worst, stronger than their best.
Aura alone stronger than their flesh.
All that they known can't compare to his guess.
Usually don't ever dare to spit next.
It's clear the reason is fear.
Even the worst MC has ears.
But we can't hear where the beat is.
The time is his flow with the kick and the snare.
When they hear me they know life ain't fair.
God bless some and some get air.
Like these conscious heads that cry.
That I get big headed and I don't know why.
Cos I, I have always been this guy.
Ever since mum sent for the sky.
I decided that that was too low.
So I'm astral travelling to another zone.
You won't ever get on the dog and the bone.
Cos I don't ever really wanna answer my phone.
Zone that I'm in is high vibration.
See the future with mind meditation.
Your peeps, poor libation.
For all the peeps that get above their station.
I place them in the right placement.
That is to say I erase them.

Ain't no-one above nor adjacent.
Still these mugs they want to get feisty.
But face it they don't really wanna face me.
I don't run so you can't ever chase me.
And I been through tings on the pavement.
But don't beg road fame cos I never made it.
My uncles, cousins and friends have done everything that yours have mate.
But I don't tell their story I tell mine.
That means I'm real and you're fake.
That said, I don't mind a bit of fiction.
If you did tell your story well.
But your raps are dryer than a dead man's top lip.
After six years of living in hell.
You meet a nice girl, you just might gel.
Might be wifey, you can't quite tell.
You know why? Cos the only bitch in the world.
Is a man and his ego he.
hides in a shell.
Mine is harder than my uncles foot back.
Who don't even need to wear shoes.

Who only eats pounded yam and stew.
With hands like a can on a man, I refuse.
Who said mum never raised no fools, your mum raised you.
You're a plonker, a plank, a donut, a tool.
You make me think that mother nature's cruel.
Then I get back and remember.
Life is a gift even when it don't look like it is.
And everybody thinks that they're cold in a booth.
Got no friends to show them the truth.
Put the pen down, become a spectator.
Go get a day job, there is no shame in it.
We need doctors and architects.
Not more crap rappers that are passed their best.
And if the cap fits you wear it.
If it fits your friend too share it.
I know it ain't the role of a parent.
To take my child's confidence and tear it.
But it is my role as a father.
To show my son about life and it's harder.

When you got a dad named Akala.
Those are big shoes to fill, be your own man.
Have you own plan, your own destiny.
Just don't ever mess with me.
Preferably bun these fools for their treachery.
Definitely those that put us in jeopardy.
Especially foes that wanna pose next to me.
Nobody ain't testing me.
It's the versatility that is killing them.
So road but I teach kids William.
Listen to my albums I actually write songs.
And of course the bars are brilliant.
We can do politics, spirituality.
Or real life road reality.
Or do this ting here with straight up vanity.
Either way, nobody can't battle me.
Much less shackle me, the maroon.
One man army, an entire platoon.
They're like won't he run out of breath soon?
How does he do that? Is he human?

Look man, it's the spirit of boukman.
Back in the flesh in a terrible crook man.
The law won't like me, ain't it obvious.
I ain't a paedophile, now a colonist.
I'm the MC that you don't wanna bother with.
To gauntlet is thrown down, who's crossing it.
Hmm, that's what I thought.
You can have your whole life to retort.
Still won't think up the things that I thought.
When I was age four.
Strach that before I was born.
In the womb when I was yet to be formed.
Before that in a past incarnation.
When I set fire to a thieves plantation.
Me and Sam Sharpe hid in the cane fields.
Two weeks straight totally stayed still.

With nothing but a blade of great steel.
Jumped on our enemies what a great kill.
Self defence is not violence it's common sense.
The first rule of nature, self preservation.
To let people kill and abuse you is just self hatred.
Turn the other cheek, why?
No-one ever got their freedom that way, lies.
When the oppressed say an eye for an eye.
They talk this crap about the world goes blind.
Just don't attack us in the first place.
And everything will be just fine.
In the mean time train hard.
Read nuff, stay sharp.
And don't diss the sisters, are you barmy?
You are putting down half your army.

Any evolution without the women in the middle is no revolution at all.

Trust me you could be back through them all.
Women were there ready to pop tools.
But we have become so cowardly that.
Rather than fight back we attack.
The only ones that ever had our back.
And that is a actual fact.
And I ain't saying that I ain't ever done that.
I'm just saying that it's time that we bun that.
So don't put my name in the same sentence.
As real revolutionaries, I'm offended.
Real revolutionaries spend their life engaged in revolutionary acts.
And as cold as I am on the mic.
Thus far, I just rap.

That said there is no comparison.
To cold for the way that I carry on.
These vultures feed off carrion.
Come along now, carry on, carry on.
Roll up roll up, two for a pound.
Bun down MC's bun whole sound.
Bun your whole clique I bun the whole town.
Take a stroll at the speed of sound.
Who said the speed of light was the fastest thing.
Never knew the speed of darkness.
A black hole absorbs all light that there is.
So how could light ever get past it?
I studied the masters and sages.
Secret teachings of all of the ages.
I don't know, I can't explain it.
The knowledge ain't mine yet I radiate it.
It's why they write sixteen lines.
And I write an essay that rhymes.
And I never went uni neither.
But my mind works just fine.

In fact no need to be modest.
My mind's a fine instrument If I'm honest.
And I promise that I'll show you where the bodies at.
Burying MC's my lickle hobby that.
And MC's don't bite me.
They ain't got the technique to even copy that.
I think I made my point.
In a manner that is more than adequate.
Let's put all the boasting aside.
I do know that I'm just channeling.
This thing, what is it?
Inspiration, the source of the spirit?
Not a man in the sky.
But a force that animates all things that are living.
Dali's brush, Akala's.
lyrics all things.
Ain't explained by the laws of physics.
Cos you've been down on your life.
Don't mean you'll ever be on top of it.
Cos for this force right here.
There ain't one that is equal and opposite.
