Athletic Lyrics
by ZOOpfish.


Baby said she love it when I'm in it.
We can get as crazy as you let it, pathetic as it sound I'm just happy that.
she said it.
Then she told me lean back and I watched her get athletic.
Watched her get Athletic, early morning yeah forget it.
She gon do her thing, and she ain't apologetic.
I just wanna know what drug got her riding energetic.
She said shhh lean back and I watched her get athletic.

Waking in like a man hunt at SAMs club.
The deals here put your motherfucking hands up.
Your dream girl and the world in my hands bruh.
I think her name Miranda right? Where your handcuffs?
Or you wouldn't let her near the immaculate.
Walk up hey you wanna see a magic trick.
Freeze, at this point I would grab ya chick.
Now you see her now you don't look at what pat just did.
We turn up, you just staying on your radish shit.
Way she dancing I can tell that she been practicing.
And her nails done hair done.
You don't need me but we'd make a great pair Hun.
And I'm liking how you bending it ova.
Seen a king do his thing no here let me show you.
If Jesus paying Lebron, I'm paying Dellavedova.
D come up from down under like hey thought I told you.
I'm the man in here, I'm the man in here.
I'm the man i here, look baby I'm the man in here.

Baby said she love it when I'm in it.
We can get as crazy as you let it, pathetic as it sound I'm just happy that.
she said it.
Then she told me lean back and I watched her get athletic.
Watched her get Athletic, early morning yeah forget it.
She gon do her thing, and she ain't apologetic.
I just wanna know what drug got her riding energetic.
She said shhh lean back and I watched her get athletic.

That's your girl take the y out.
Got her showing off, acting like its try outs.
Drop it down so low need a buy out.
Got a party whole zoo gon fly out.
And I ain't talking plane shit.
We just dressed to impress you in plane shit.
I could probably speedo there.
Ya Chick still coming with shit, she don't care.
Ehhhhh.
She like hey what's up hello.
She a frat queen meaning she a damn hoe.
Couldn't get me, fucked the whole damn zoo.
Will, Baby Kev, Even tried Ham too.
Just don't lie to me baby.
You already fucked every guy in here baby.
Yeahhh.
Just don't lie to baby.
You a frat queen so don't try with me baby.
Go, go girl get nasty.
3rd floor Gang Gang, game get at me.
Bed like track meets she might lap me.
Damn, she a bedroom athlete.

Baby said she love it when I'm in it.
We can get as crazy as you let it, pathetic as it sound I'm just happy that.
she said it.
Then she told me lean back and I watched her get athletic.
Watched her get Athletic, early morning yeah forget it.
She gon do her thing, and she ain't apologetic.
I just wanna know what drug got her riding energetic.
She said shhh lean back and I watched her get athletic.
