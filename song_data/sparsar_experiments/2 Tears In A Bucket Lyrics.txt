2 Tears In A Bucket Lyrics
by Ruff Ryders.

Ruff Ryders niggas, blood in, blood out.
Sheek, Methical.
Yo yo, hey yo.
Soon as I cop the nine, I pop the nine.
But when I take it out the box, I represent Lox.
Now when I flow, you hit the rewind button.
So I charge out more, want it all at the door.
Fuck heat, Sheek, walk around with an oven.
Who you gonna kill with that little Foreman grill?
How's it gonna look when I come through your block?
Sheek, Funk Doc, Meth on top.
Porsche, 300 horse fly by.
Back open, pumpin' How High.
Yeah, can y'all see that, bitch.
You can call me whatcha want 'cuz I'll Be Dat.
Get off my dick, I don't care about no jewels.
As long as the condo's paid and the truck I choose.
I'm telling y'all niggas, if it's not double R.
You can spell my name out on the side of the car.
Come and Ruff Ryde with us.
If you wanna get high with us.
If you wanna get down with us.
Come on now, yeah, come on.
Come and Ruff Ryde with us.
If you wanna get high with us.
If you wanna get down with us.
Come on now.
Yo, yo, I got a twin cam exhaust connected to the jaw.
A five speed clutch on my paw when I write.
I glow like the pegs in Lite-Brite.
3000 volts of lightnin' when ya fly the right kite.
Me and Meth be Hennesey, two ice cubes.
We can draw or do I choose?
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip.
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick.
My avalanche, it came with 10 feet of snow.
I'm cold blooded, my fam half Eskimo.
My flows move like endo.
Turn ten nickels to ten loads out of ten stones.
Ride the crash course, do the math on it.
Swizz Beatz, you can ride Amtrak on it.
But I'm on it, grillin' with George Foreman.
Ya peeps is at the Grammy Awards cornin'.
The ice, the fat wallet son, I won it.
In the helicopter warnin' before mornin'.
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga, Doc.
Fuck ya momma on my sweat band, nigga.
You tough guys will get smacked in the club.
With the gun that I bought from Mack in the club.
It's P P P from Bricks to Brook-nam.
Bring me some more ass to whoop on.
Come and Ruff Ryde with us.
If you wanna get high with us.
If you wanna get down with us.
Come on now, yeah, come on.
Come and Ruff Ryde with us.
If you wanna get high with us.
If you wanna get down with us.
Come on now, yeah, come on.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror.
Scooper high yellow Cinderella, Meth forever.

But if I have to, I have to.
It's all in the mind, I stay ahead of time.
While you're falling behind, trying to relight ya lime.
It's a crime when I drop online's design.
That tick, tick boom, blow your mind.
Yeah me, M E T H the O the D.
Can't be done like tryin' to find a penny in the sea.
Nigga, run for cover son, go and get them guns.
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around and gettin' ones.
Swizz Beatz, the track in the head, but I instead.
Pull my dart gun and bust sixteen until it's dead.
I'm The Game, all of my dogs be off the chain.
Yelling Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang.
Come and Ruff Ryde with us.
If you wanna get high with us.
If you wanna get down with us.
Come on now, yeah, yeah, come on.
Come and Ruff Ryde with us.
If you wanna get high with us.
If you wanna get down with us.
Come on now, yeah, come on.
Come and Ruff Ryde with us.
If you wanna get high with us.
If you wanna get down with us.
Come on now, yeah, yeah, come on.
