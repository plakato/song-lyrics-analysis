Still Speedin' (Kano Remix) Lyrics
by Sway UK.

Walk right, walk right in.
Walk right, walk right in.
Walk right in.

I was telling everybody up your speed.
That was a couple of years ago.
And now I'm revving up for deliverance.
Switching up gears, got a couple of years to go.
Super slow!
Here we go! As soon as you hear that, go!
Liverpool to Portsmouth, yeah.

Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
I got the people screaming.
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!

Click, click, here strap.
Seat belt Derek's back!
Time to blow like I'm Dynamo.
No more disappearing act.
I know you miss me, I miss you too!
Sometimes that's what a mist will do.
Like Taio I was cruising.
Now it's time to take my steering back.
One of the best to ever do, they say.
A testament to this game.
And even in the wind I never blew it.
I swayed but kept in my lane.
They call me Fleetwood Mac.
I'm a mac with a mac with a fleet.
Still getting royalties.
No spoiler but I spoil me!

I got the crowd screaming.
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
I got the people screaming.
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Make some noise!
Still speeding!

I got the world screaming K.A.'s back! Yeah, it's official.
Trumpets, please! No kicks, but brother this is the rizzle.
Slick rick bitch, the.
ruler's here for shizzle.
K.A. and Sway, game over! Blow the whistle!
Music you got as shoe's fit too, paint these pictures so visual.
MC's wanna come spit too and girls wanna go and shake hips too!
I'm still speeding, you don't wanna meet me at the light.
Rear view mirror, ain't a thing in sight.

They try to give me a ticket.
But I ripped it like a raffle.
Tell them people I am Mr. Derek Safo.
I'm still speeding!
Pedal to the metal on a level I ain't gonna settle.
For anything less than gold I ain't gonna meddle around about.
And up down and trying to build since I was like a kid but never had the Lego.
Running through the fields and the medals of Ally Pally.
And now I'm on a hill,.
if Geppetto was able to make a fake boy real.
I can definitely make a real hard boy as steel!
I ain't gonna stop until I do a couple of millions.
I gave them my demo, now it's time to do a deal again!
I'm back up on the bill again, I'm fresh from the bank, Bob's your uncle.
!
Mine's uncle Phil again.
Because I've got the willpower and the potential.
And I got the credentials, all of the essentials.
When it gets stressful my BP rises.
But I'm never gonna stop unless I need to get petrol.
Still speedin'!
