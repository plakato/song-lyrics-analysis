Anything (Old Skool Radio Version) Lyrics
by SWV.


I like that, y'all, I like that ya like.

I like that, y'all, I like that like that.

I like that, y'all, I like that ya like.
I like that, y'all, I like that like that.

I like that, y'all, I like that check it out.

I like that, y'all, check it out check it out.

Anticipation of what's to come.
I'm so happy that I'm the lucky one.
So long I've waited but it's never too late for love.
It feels so right, baby that it can't be wrong.
Where I am weak baby you make me strong.
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do.
It's all up to you because.

Anything for you I am gonna try to.
I'm bonafide, body's just for you.
Pleasure every way you can ride.
Just to get with you.
If you choose to.

Whatever method used is alright with me.
As long as you get to where you need to be.
This is the vision made for both of our eyes to see.
It feels so right, it can't be wrong.
Where I am weak baby you make me strong.
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do.
It's all up to you because.

Ol Dirty Bastard.
Dirty Bas, style.
cuts like glass.
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass.
Yo Taj, another-.
like platinum hit.
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit.

Method Man.
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room.
Tical, hailing.
from the Shaolin Isle.
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C.
With the S-S-double-double-U to the V-V.
Me me going downtown, let me see.
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now.
Listen I ain't sweating no competition.
Flow, going mad low like I'm dissing.

U-God.
Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group.
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep.
Nonstop put you on the chopping block.
Unorthodox, attitude to melting pot.

Method Man.
I'll do anything, I'm so into you.
Right here, I'm Weak, downtown with the Wu.
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room.
The S-S-double-double-U to the V-V.
