Behind the Mask Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.

Laying down sitting on the couch all ?

Twisted Insane.
As I travel the globe.
People come to my shows.
And they want to know.
What's behind the mask.

Fans.
Is that twisted insane?
Oh my god it is.
I think he's the best, and he raps so fast.
I don't know how he do it.
Man I heard he ain't human.
I heard he's a ghost.
I heard he's a demon.
I heard he's a monster.
Ain't from this world.

What's behind the mask?

Brain.
The mask, the mask, the mask.
My war paint designed to strike fear and reveal the monster inside.
A representation of the demon within.
A visual to my soul.
A symbol of my presence.
When I enter this mask, I enter my realm.
I see the world as is and as is the world sees me.
something backwards, will check later.
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

I can already hear you talking twisted is the wicked so we talking about the.
heat or he be rapping too fast.
I be reading every comment on my facebook and youtube and even on my twitter.
when they wolfing that trash.
? Behind the mask.
always talking in subliminals.
But tell me why the fuck they want to label me a criminal.
Under estimate me I'm a motherfucking general.
I'll pull a razor blade and get to chopping off your genitals.
And I could be drunk driving up outta crash man.
Full up on the pedal ? I put ya with the gas tank.
?
? for the people.
dying I am living life up in the fast lane.
I'm Jason and Freddy mixed with a little Eddie -.
Scissorhands chopping.
people up into confetti.
Left them laying in the street chest looking like spaghetti.
I be standing on the corner if you want me come and get me.
It's like Amityville but on the real sometimes I feel like I'm a demon.
Doesn't matter who I believe in.
I used to be afraid when it was dark.
Now I sit ?without the can? in front of folks with my forty and my weed in.
I bet you feeling real safe when you talk shit from your keyboard in your.
home, quiet as a mouse.
Don't know who you was fucking with.
I could be the one to get a fully loaded gun and get to breaking in your house.
Told your people I'm the wrong.
? bring the.
? or two.
Do you think it's music but I really bring the heat.
Do it to your face, murder was the case.
See the demons all around me every time a nigga try to speak.
Thought about chopping off the feet there will be no running.
When I cut you up I'll put you in a room full of pain.
I'm getting sick and tired of all the people on the internet.
That's wolfing up but they don't really want to see insane.

They ain't phasing my sick.

Real pain, redrum.

They tell me I'm a devil because the way I spit it.
Tell me gets em reminiscing about some kind of wicked demons.
You find out what's behind the mask you're running from.
Why don't you erase the dark and tell me what you ?
Open this enough to win a ? feeling me.
The fact that you continue with this crap it all be killing me.
I never dream.
? please you stupid bitch cuz that would ? as ill as me.
You'll never get the realer me.
Niggas run up and then get knocked out then I put the shit on Instagram.
Nigga better back up he can act tough.
He was fruity as a motherfucking Toucan Sam.
Nigga that ?
They don't want to see behind the mask because they be look into the eyes of.
horror death.
So mythological and diabolical I'll rearrange an itty-bitty brand and put my.
symbol on your chest.
Turn your room into a mess.
? on your dress ? not to mention all the bloody walls.
Fuck your negativity if you ain't got no Righteous shit to say about a niggas.
shit don't say that shit at all.
I be looking at the feed.
Smoking on my weed.
Take a hit and get to trippin on you motherfuckers wolf.
If I hear somebody say I'm ? fuck this bitch at a show where she ?
When it come to pimpin' I'mma play it by the book.
Walk behind a nigga use the shadow of a pimp.
And everything you hoes ever done to me we ? number one ? bitch.
Skip to my lou and kick rocks when you dip.
Fuck 'em and I cut 'em bitch you already know.
Pick your poison and bring your boys in this motherfucker so they can come and.
carry the body out the door.
