Rwhisky Champ- Wan na Give You That Love 
 
I wan na give you 
That special love. Oh oh x2, 
 
I'm up in the club, 
I can't even sleep 
It 3AM. I don't know what happenin' 
I'mma drink till I sleep, I'mma drink till I'm faded, 
I ain't lookin' for love, 
But, I'm lookin' for you, I'm tryinna, have fun, Have no worries. All I know I'mma
party till my haters show up and say god damn this n*ggah knows how to party
till it morning. 
 
I wan na give you 
That special love. Oh oh x2
