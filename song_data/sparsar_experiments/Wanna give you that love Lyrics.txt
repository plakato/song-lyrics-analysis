Rwhisky Champ-Wanna Give You That Love.

I wanna give you.
That special love oh oh x2.

I'm up in the club.
I can't even sleep.
It 3AM,I don't know what happenin'.
I'mma drink till I sleep,I'mma drink till I'm faded.
I ain't lookin' for love.
But I'm lookin' for you,I'm tryinna have fun,Have no worries,all I know I'mma.
party till my haters show up and say god damn this n*ggah knows how to party.
till it morning.

I wanna give you.
That special love oh oh x2.
