Back To Prom Lyrics
by Volbeat.

Forever and ever, even today and after.
I kept our picture forever.
Back in the late fifties, we went to the prom and kissing.
But you went home with Tom Ripley.

Throw the guy a meat bone, put him on a train.
That's the way it should end.
Living on the outskirts, forty miles away.
Where the lonely road ends.

Forever and ever, even today and after.
I still believe you can hear me.
Believer, deceiver, the question lies beneath the letter.
I wrote you in late May.

Throw the guy a meat bone, put him on a train.
That's the way it should end.
Living on the outskirts, forty miles away.
Where the lonely road ends.
Where the lonely road ends.
Where the guitar gangsters sing.
