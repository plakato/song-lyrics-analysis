How To Love (Remix) Lyrics
by Quan.


Figure out how to love.
Figure out how to love.
Figure out how to love.

See you had a lot of crooks try and steal your heart.
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out.
How to love, how to love.
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever.
Now you in this corner just trynin' to put it together.
How to love, how to love.

I knew a boy who knew a boy who knew each other well.
And to these ? there was nothing you could tell.
They ? the burner up ? all the time.
And never did the thought of sex run 'cross they playful minds.
Until one day that boy I knew, he brought that subject up.
He asked that boy I used to know, When you gon' let me touch?
He smiled and shrugged his shoulders, smile, laughin' all the while.
He learned to be ?, but God knows he's just a child.
They didn't use a condom, magnum, trojan, or no such.
He told that boy I used to know ?
They did it raw and afterwards there wasn't much to say.
He left that boy I used to know exactly where he lay.

They didn't speak, avoidin' eyes and went they separate ways.
They didn't see each other again for quite a lot of days.
They didn't speak, avoidin' eyes and went they separate ways.
They didn't see each other again for quite a lot of days.
Until that boy I used to know showed up to his surprise.
With some papers in his hands sayin' positive STI.
And the moral to my story is be careful what you do.
Cause the actions that you make affect more people than just you.
? we on our own in this race.
? cause the color of our face.
Beat the odds, be an individual for a change.
Cause the actions that you take ain't always worth the ?

See I just want you to know.
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful.
Beautiful, you're beautiful.
And I want you to know.
You're far from the usual.
Far from the usual.
