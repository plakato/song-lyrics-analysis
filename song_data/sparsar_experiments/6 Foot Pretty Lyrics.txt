6 Foot Pretty Lyrics
by Rufus Blaq.


Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch.

Rufus Blaq, I'm back on my shit.
And that shit pretty.

Yo, Cadillac, wood-grained.
Candy-apple red paint.
White walls on these.
I do everything you cain't.
I'm a king everywhere I walk you hear the horns blow.
Nigga, even as a kid, I was paranormal.
Started from a park bench, check my discography.
My first investment was Hennessy and pornography.
Stowed a couple Ford Tauruses and did some robberies.
Now I got my mind right, I own a couple colonies.
Spell my name, B-L-A Q for the quality.
Women want a skip kissing because they'd rather swallow me.
Yeah baby my training is so vigorous.
I worked on my biceps, instead I got a bigger dick.
Fat chicks can get it, but, I prefer a slender chick.
Edgar Allen Poe shit, this is accurate penmanship.
As a baby I felt pain my first year.
Alcoholic, been an addict ever since my first beer.
No retreat, still kept my swagger through my worst years.
Here's my testimony little homie, this is church, yeah.

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch.

Cover up the signs and the omens.
I catch everything haters throw at me, I'm Terrell Owens.
I'm a polarized figure, let me put it Ebonics, I'm that nigga.
My hustle flow is like Russell Crowe's.
With an unmatched poise that no cuffs can hold.
I hear your display and bravado.
Pretty ? rappers alive, they avocados.
This is the only way to get through to you Earthlings.
I'm spitting it triple X, fuck a PG-13.
That nigga's so fly, haters get air sick.
They're rhinestones, I'm twenty-five carats.
Yeah, my ? chulo.
I piss diamonds and got money out the ?
I love women with big booties and tattoos.
A bad bitch that can run in heels like the track shoes.
I mop floors with rappers until the towel glisten.
I used to slap 'em up, but now I let the style kiss 'em.
I'm the spirit of Frank Wright, heard your vagina tight.
I gotta lust for life.
At the same time I'm eating asparagus with skirt steak.

Even back when I was fat and in my worst shape.
Asthmatic and all, I shitted on your mix tape!
After this I need a toothpick cuz I just ate.
This track ? fuck us, now I got to lick the plate.
Yeah, my ? Chulo.
Copy.

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch.
