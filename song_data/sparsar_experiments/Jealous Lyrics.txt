Jealous Lyrics
by X-Raided  (a.k.a. Nefarious).


Nigga 
While, you do this shit for fun. 
I! Do this shit on wax 
Getting paid for my raps on my income tax, 
Stack G'z, shippin, CD's nationwide 
California to Alaska 
New York to Nebraska 
Ride when it's necessary 
Otherwise, I'm at the record company flirtin with the secretary 
That shit you speakin on is obsolete, 
Irrelevant issues. 
You, a wannabe 
And, your crew is softer than some Kleenex tissues. 
Me. Next to you is like Mike Jordan. Next to Mugsy Bogues 
You mug me rollin in Buggy cuz we rollin, Vogues 
Jealous fellas must be hatin. It cuz, I'm havin mine, 
Yo animosity got me knowin. I have to have a nine 
And half the time I paccs mac with two Gloccs 
I sport, a vest fucc that shit they did to 2pac 
Don't. Take it off for shit when I'm in a foreign land 
And can't no white Lac creep up on my Caravan 
When you, the man, you got ta roll with major ussalama 
You, never know who's, plottin 
Be ready for the drama. 
And recognize when you slip. You slide till you die 
By homicide when they got the element of surprise 
Open. Your eyes and it'll infect you like so poison ivy 
Have you in an ICU connected to an IV 
Lungs collapse. Perhaps it was premeditated 
Then niggas hated cuz, I'm Raided nigga 
 
X-Raided. They say fellas is hella, jealous 
In, Sac-Town 
So, I don't fucc with'em 
They, Say 
Dott Dog Fellas is hella. Jealous

Fellas is hella jealous 
Dott Dog In Sac-Town 
So. I don't fucc with'em 
 
Now, you gots to be cautious 
One-times' in the hood tryin to hawk us 
You can't slip cuz. If you slip, they aim for the heart 
So after dark. I'M on the under in a Skylark 
Them dogs, bark, 
And, sellin, wolf ticcets, but I ain't buyin 
Tryin to have me in a casket 
My nigga. I ain't lyin 
Get, that ass kicced. If you come to close to the head, colas 
Tryin to have you gone takin, your head, smooth off yo shoulders, 
Somebody, shoulda, told ya. 
Soldiers march till the bass kicc 
It's like NASA, you got ta, give me space, bitch, 
Enemy, cliccs orbit. The hood like satellites 
Knights stay cuz. They on the saddle through wars, battles and fights 
They try to get you 
Especially. If you havin cash 
Hatin to see you with hoes and shit, they never had 
You mad cuz you broke, but whose fault is that 
Them jealous fellas is the reason that I brought a strap 
 
X-Raided, They say fellas is hella jealous

Niggas, always on the dicc everytime. I see ya 
Bitch ass nigga, ..., yeah, 
, 
Ths, ain't, no game, 
Studio gangsterism promoted sayin, they ridin 
But residin to Southern Dakota. 
You get checced 
Cuz you neglectin yo duties as a warrior. 
You get no respect. 
I only got love for the neighborhood destroyers. 
That put it down with a passion: 
If, you got funk. You got action, 
No hesitation when we smashin 
And the destination's, your barrio 
You better, be ready. 
Make, your brain look like spaghetti 
Then. We run faster than Mario Andretti 
It's on ... in a major way. 
Playa hatas watch yo bacc it's yo day to pay 
We ain't gon play nigga 
We serious as a heart attacc 
Bustin through offensive line bringin the Quarter, bacc 
Concusion sustained 
Bringin the pain like Reggie White 
And. Every night we strapped ready for a deadly fight, 
Like Daniel Boone paccin, the big gun that goes boom, 
Premeditated niggas hated cuz. I'M Raided 
It's yo day of doom
