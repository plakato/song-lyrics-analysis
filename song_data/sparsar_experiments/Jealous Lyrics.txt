Jealous Lyrics
by X-Raided  (a.k.a. Nefarious).


Nigga.
While you do this shit for fun.
I do this shit on wax.
Getting paid for my raps on my income tax.
Stack G'z, shippin CD's nationwide.
California to Alaska.
New York to Nebraska.
Ride, when it's necessary.
Otherwise I'm at the record company flirtin with the secretary.
That shit you speakin on is obsolete.
Irrelevant issues.
You a wannabe.
And your crew is softer than some Kleenex tissues.
Me next to you is like Mike Jordan next to Mugsy Bogues.
You mug me rollin in Buggy cuz we rollin Vogues.
Jealous fellas must be hatin it cuz I'm havin mine.
Yo animosity got me knowin I have to have a nine.
And half the time I paccs mac with two Gloccs.
I sport a vest, fucc that shit they did to 2pac.
Don't take it off for shit when I'm in a foreign land.
And can't no white Lac creep up on my Caravan.
When you the man you gotta roll with major ussalama.
You never know who's plottin.
Be ready for the drama.
And recognize when you slip you slide till you die.
By homicide, when they got the element of surprise.
Open your eyes and it'll infect you like so poison ivy.
Have you in an ICU connected to an IV.
Lungs collapse perhaps it was premeditated.
Then niggas hated cuz I'm Raided nigga.

X-Raided: They say fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
So I don't fucc with 'em.
They Say.
Dott Dog: Fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
I know what's up with 'em.
X-Raided: Yeah, they say.
Fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
I know what's up with 'em.
Fellas is hella jealous.
Dott Dog: In Sac-Town.
So I don't fucc with 'em.

Now you gots to be cautious.
One-times' in the hood tryin to hawk us.
You can't slip cuz if you slip they aim for the heart.
So after dark I'm on the under in a Skylark.
Them dogs bark.
And sellin wolf ticcets but I ain't buyin.
Tryin to have me in a casket.
My nigga I ain't lyin.
Get that ass kicced if you come to close to the head colas.
Tryin to have you gone takin your head smooth off yo shoulders.
Somebody shoulda told ya.
Soldiers march till the bass kicc.
It's like NASA, you gotta give me space bitch.
Enemy cliccs, orbit the hood like satellites.
Knights stay cuz they on the saddle through wars, battles, and fights.
They try to get you.
Especially if you havin cash.
Hatin to see you with hoes and shit they never had.
You mad cuz you broke but whose fault is that.
Them jealous fellas is the reason that I brought a strap.

X-Raided: They say fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
So I don't fucc with.
They Say fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
I know what's up with 'em.
Nigga fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
So I don't fucc with 'em.
Nigga fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
Dott Dog: I know what's up with 'em.

Yeah...Nigga...Hatin ass mutha fuccas.
Niggas always on the dicc, everytime I see ya.
Bitch ass nigga...yeah.

Ths ain't no game.
Studio gangsterism promoted sayin they ridin.
But residin to Southern Dakota.
You get checced.
Cuz you neglectin yo duties as a warrior.
You get no respect.
I only got love for the neighborhood destroyers.
That put it down with a passion.
If you got funk, you got action.
No hesitation when we smashin.
And the destination's your barrio.
You better be ready.
Make your brain look like spaghetti.
Then we run faster than Mario Andretti.
It's on...in a major way.
Playa hatas watch yo bacc, it's yo day to pay.
We ain't gon play nigga.
We serious as a heart attacc.
Bustin through offensive line bringin the Quarter bacc.
Concusion sustained.
Bringin the pain like Reggie White.
And every night we strapped ready for a deadly fight.
Like Daniel Boone, paccin the big gun that goes boom.
Premeditated niggas hated cuz I'm Raided.
It's yo day of doom.

X-Raided: Nigga fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
So I don't fucc with 'em.
Nigga.
Dott dog: Fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
X-Raided: I know what's up with 'em.
Nigga fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
So I don't fucc with 'em.
Nigga fellas is hella jealous.
In Sac-Town.
I know what's up with 'em.

Nigga what, what.

From Sac-Town to Stock-Town nigga.
From the south side to the north side nigga.
Murder ya'll bitch ass niggas.
