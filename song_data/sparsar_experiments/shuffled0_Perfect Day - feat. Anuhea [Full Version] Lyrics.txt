Perfect Day - feat. Anuhea [Full Version] Lyrics
by Awa.

While drifting deeper into your eyes.
You're my symphony and I wanna listen.
Anuhea.
Com/en/awa-perfect-day-lyrics.
Show love to me, my honey.
Me tātari tonu māua'.
Tell me is this love that I'm feeling?
And tell me, and tell me you'll forever be mine.
Komo 'oe i loko o ko'u moe 'uhane.
Anuhea.
You're my perfect day.
Html#ixzz398fbq.
Hearing sweet melodies.

Aia au ma na lani.
He la hemolele kēia'.
My perfect day would be you in my arms.
S.
I te āio o te aroha.
Vibin' through the sky.
You have my heart.
Sharing our dreams.
Kia kotahi ai te wairua.
I thank the Lord for all His blessings.
You are my only.
Watching the sunrise.
Aia au ma na lani.
Awa.
Anuhea.
Singing a love song for you and me.
Today is ours and no one else's.
Me tātari tonu māua'.
Mo āke tonu.
Awa.
And I don't even wanna try.
So to you, this song I sing.
To be with another guy.
Toku whaiāipo, haere mai.
Feel mellow sun rays slipping through the palms.
My perfect day would be in your arms.
Letting time slip away.
Watching the birds fly by.
Free and naive.
If there's one thing I know.
He aloha wela  ko'u mai ke Akua mai la.
Solely my purpose for living.
My love will never roam.
Echoing your design.
I te āio o te aroha.
Sharing our dreams.
Make love to me, my baby.
And tell me you'll forever be mine.
Dc.
It will never fade away.
He la hemolele kēia'.
Anuhea.
Mahalo ke Akua no kēia la.
My baby, you're perfect to me.
