A Raindance In Traffic Lyrics
by The Wonder Years.

I'm fantasizing about doing a raindance in traffic.
I'm fantasizing about a storm to wash me away.
If you'd study the laugh-lines, you'd see that I'm cracking.
I spent six months now feeling like dead weight.

The fighter in me must have died a long time ago.
I must have been watching his ghost;.
Just going through the motions, just putting on a face.
It feels like 1929 and I'm on the verge of a great collapse today.

Every window in this house faces a brick wall.
I'm panicked and absent like a bird in a cage.
The word from the front lines says that we're out-gunned.
But I can't walk away, no, I can't walk away, no, I can't.

I was just happy to be a contender.
I was just aching for anything.
And I used to have such steady hands but.
Now I can't keep 'em from shaking.
x2.

I can't keep 'em from shaking.
x6.
