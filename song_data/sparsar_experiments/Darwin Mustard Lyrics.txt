Darwin Mustard Lyrics
by Quiero Club.

We are after you Mr. mustard.
I'll show you how its done.
We are after you Mr. mustard.
Let me tell you how its done.
We are after you.
They are after you.
We are after you.
They are after you.

And if I choose to remind you.
Your life is pretty short.
Just come and ask Mr. Mustard.
He will tell you how its done.

She came from the water.
He came from the sun.
They show afterhours when you are alone.

When you are alone.

All right.
