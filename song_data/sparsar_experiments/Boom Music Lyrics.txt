Boom Music Lyrics
by Quasimoto.


Hit the stereo in an instant.
And then I twist up a bud light an incense X5.
Bump the Boom Music 'cuz I found a fat L nine times out of ten I use it to.
start this way.

Quasimoto.
Hey yo Madlib ya why don't you hit em up with that high speaking.


I gets high and start taking out wack selections.
First by electin' EricB for president.
Zulu Nation for protection.
Tribe Called Quest, KRS One secret Hip Hop Intelligence.
Diamond D and the whole DITC.
Ultramagnetic MC's.
Gang Starr doing a show for free and you can smoke sensi.
Lord Finesse teaching rhyme telepathy.
Biz Markie did a cover for The P Is Still Free.
Back when style was the name belt buckles and Lee's.
Boomers, Sticky green trees.

Hit the stereo in an instant.
And then I twist up a bud light an incense X5.
Bump the Boom Music 'cuz I found a fat L nine times out of ten I use it to.
start this way.

Madlib.
Hey yo Quas hit em with that green talk.

Oh I gets high and starts taking out wack niggas.
Then fly up into the sky and use my lyrics as a trigger.
Always Pull It , let the bullet slide through to the left.
Went so far undergroud with out diggin ended up in west China.
Yo Style sounds like youve been eating some bad vagina.
The Unseen you Unclean Niggas mad cause you can't find us.
We step, we rep, we comin' out of the gates.
We can do it for papes; cause madlib got the beat tapes.
Lord Quas in the end; always win the sweepstakes.

Grip the stereo in an instant.
And then I twist up a bud light an incense X5.
Bump the Boom Music 'cuz I found a fat L nine times out of ten I use it to.
start this way.
