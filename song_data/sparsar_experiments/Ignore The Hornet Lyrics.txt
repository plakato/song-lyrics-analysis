Ignore The Hornet Lyrics
by Xazz.


It's ringing in your ear when you try to formulate your own opinion.
You try to rub it off, but you cannot escape the single story vision.

Do you really need for me to tell you.
Do you really need for me to warn you.

Destroys your sense of real, and it takes you to a place of pure distraction.
You better run and hide before the lies they say will force you into action.

Do you really need for me to tell you.
Do you really need for me to warn you.

Instrumental.

No matter where you look, it's always lurking there, waiting to sting you.
So, be careful where you tread my friend, hold tight so all your morals will.
stay with you.

Do you really need for me to tell you.
I said, I said.
Do you really need for me to warn you.

Instrumental.
