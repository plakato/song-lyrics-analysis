Real Life Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


Made nigga – I do what the fuck I feel like.
That shit you rap about – I do that shit in real life.
That ho you feenin' about – I fucked that bitch in real life.
That car you dreaming about – I bought that shit in real life.
Real life, real life, nigga this my real life.
I ain't just talking boy I got that white in real life.
You just be talking you ain't got no stripes in real life.
Watch where you walking you ain't ‘bout that life in real life.

Might as well throw away your plate, bitch I'm trying to get all the cake.
Got a whole bunch of quarters like I'm trying to get all the states.
Give a fuck about all the hate nigga long as I get fucking paid.
Bitches call me Arnold Schwarzenegger ‘cause I'm fucking made.
See me in Gabanna shades then you know that Thugga blazed.
Long ass extensions like Poetic Justice braids.
Watch custom made, Audemar Piguet gleaming.
You niggas penny pinching like Hardaway dreaming.
Got killers on my payroll, them bitches say I'm an A-hole.
I tell her hasta luego, you saving hoes like Django.
Watch who you talking to like Tango, that 3-8-0 in my corduroys.
And my heat got a cooler like Miami's waterboy.

Wake up 7:30, cup extra muddy.
Blunt filled up with that yellow teletubby.
Bitch extra slutty, she gon' be my lunch.
Had my balls on her tongue like some Reebok Pumps.
And you know I'm Uncle Ruckus when it comes down to that white.
Check your temp in Celsius, nigga we ain't fair in height.
Man these rappers just be rapping, me, I'm really ‘bout that life.
Just bought a silencer to make the k silent like knife.
I had fun with your wife, yes I fucking did.
Got my children in her mouth like Honey I Shrunk The Kids.
Young nigga do it big, and get some change out her.
She either gives me brain or I fuck the brains out her.
