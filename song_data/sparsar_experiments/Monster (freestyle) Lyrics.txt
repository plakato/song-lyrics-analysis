Monster (freestyle) Lyrics
by Quilly.

5am why is these smokers still Callin.
Niggas tried to take me out the game Im still Ballin.

Next month its gonn be a dime no Bargin I been.
Dickin down ya bitch from the rear.
I been plottin on ya bitch all year.
Circle small cuz you niggas all squares.
12 for the sweatsuit nigga this my ball gear.
I put my Bitches on Uber.
I put my niggas on pussy.
Im tryna build a empire my bitch badder than Cookie.
I mean hot as Taraji that pussy wet as Dasani.
Sellin percs in the lobby I been exchanging Armani.
I send the money to Jails my nigga buy you some suits.
My nigga just came home Im bouta buy him some boots.
Im bouta do it real big nigga gimme the loot.
E and Reds Wit Truck Im bouta get me a coupe.
On the Road to Riches goin to Jail was my worst route.
Tell ya bitch we still got the sour and them percs out.
Pocket full of blue faces make me pull the smurfs out.
Just hit the gym on you bitches and that workout.
Rappers washed up bubble bath get a tub for em.
Niggas wanna live my lifestyle Young Thug on Em.
Killin these niggas Life support pull the plug on em.
I ain't really where i wanna be but I buzzed on Em.
17 I was on the Greyhound.
My oldhead really flew them birds in from A-Town.
I came up Cuz I stayed down.
I made 20 thousand dollars in a playground.
Pill flippa, cake gaina.
I serve niggas, curve bitches like waist trainas.
I put my Lawyer on his Feet.
Marshawn Lynch Im a Beast.
