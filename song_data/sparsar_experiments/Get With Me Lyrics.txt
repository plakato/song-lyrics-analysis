Get With Me Lyrics
by 3rd Storee.


You should get with me.
If you get with me.
You should get with me.
If you get with me.

Lady, think I just wanna hug and squeeze?
Think I just wanna touch and tease?
Mami I ain't tryin' to cut and leave.
I'd rather cruise the crib let you touch the Keys.
Said your ex made it hot, I'm a up the degrees.
But lady, it's not a game.
I ain't lookin' to kill you with corny lines.
Like you lookin' familiar never ever, ever ever.
You the one I see in my eyes.
And I'm just wantin' you to be at my side.
Holler at her.

Do I look like I'm fakin' with you?
Am out to hurt you.
Do care about you.
Just wouldn't love you.
Won't get me to you.
Just want it from you.
Is not out to please you.
Could show you I'm true.
Gave the world to you.
Showed you how I do.
Make your words untrue.
Tell you I need you.
Said my heart's for you.
Can't live without you.
Can't sleep without you.
Would you know I'm feelin' you? baby, yeah.

3rd Storee {* over chorus}.
What do I do? You should get with me.
To show you that I'm really feelin' you If you get with me.
You would feel me You should get with me.
If you just let me get next to you If you get with me.
I know I'll do You should get with me.
Whatever it takes to please you If you get with me.
Baby you'll see You should get with me.
If you just let me get next to you If you get with me.

If you would just hear what I say.
Would just look my way.
Would not turn away.
Would see I don't play.
Just listen to me.
Knew what I can be.
Weren't playin' to me.
Were open to me.
Would see what I'm 'bout.
Know how I get down.
Would see I can please.
Would really want me.
Would know that I'm true.
Would see that I'm into you.
You might decide.
To make it me and you, baby!

You a Glamour Miss.
You don't know if I could handle or miss?
C'mon now, I got stamina Miss.
And don't think cause I'm into ballin' that I'm a control freak.
I won't stop them male friends from callin'.
And I ain't talkin' kids and marriage.
You been hurt in the past.
Not a thing, I get rid of that baggage.
If we - get together, cop mansion, whip together.
And if I slack up I get it together.
I picture your skin covered in the softest fabrics.
Daytimes, Central Park we in the horse and carriage.
Or let you push forces and karats.
Don't take it as a gift, baby girl.
If you my all you could have it.
and could be that dude that you want in your life.
and could put the future right in front of your eyes.
and couldn't live after all that I say.
Do you think that I'd go out of my way?
Answer that mami.
