Shame on You Lyrics
by Quebe Sisters.


Shame, shame on you.
Shame, shame on you.
Gave my heart as a token.
In return it was broken.
Hide your face, shame on you.

Shame, shame on you.
Shame, shame on you.
Took my car and my money.
Done me wrong and that ain't funny.
Woe is me, shame on you.

Shame, shame on you.
Shame, shame on you.
You can play your little game.
You'll find out who is to blame.
Hide your face, shame on you.

Shame, shame on you.
Shame, shame on you.
Can you hold your head up high.
Look your friends right in the eye.
No you can't, shame on you.
No you can't, shame on you.
