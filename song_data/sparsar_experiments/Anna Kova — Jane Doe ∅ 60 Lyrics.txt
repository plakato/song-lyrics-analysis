Anna Kova — Jane Doe ∅ 60 Lyrics
by 75ème Session.

Couplet.
I'm anonymous in this crowd.
Try to reflect on my own self, but it's too loud.
It's too loud.
And at the end of the day, you try to walk away.
From who you are with a couple drinks at the bar.
So, I'd rather be the great unknown for now.
Seems easier to live that way somehow, somehow.
Got the fear of the unknown, well that's a lie.
You give yourself everyday like you're not afraid to die.
Just to live a little bit, and run a little bit.
Excite those veins just by hitting it and hitting it again.
You always want to get in my brain, leave a couple of stains.
Keep the dust, put some dirt but.
That ain't gonna work, no.
No that ain't gonna work no more.
Well what if I say my name?
Will it change a thing?
You're always gonna find a reason to blame me.
Not even trying to know the real me.
Ooh I gotta say, I'm tired of this game.
Tight up in egotistical chains.
I know who I am and what I wannna be.
Should I even care if you agree?
I mean don't get me wrong, I'll listen, listen and.
Try to go along, given given.
The time you took to put your words on your looks.
And visions, all pleasing to your mind envisions.
Let me just finish this lines, speak all my rhymes.
I'mma get back to my direction, thanks for your attention.
