CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT MATTERS, AND ACCORDING TO WHO?
I GOTTA SHORT LIFE TO LIVE IM NOT REPORTING TO YOU.

PLUS WE ALL SMALL STANDING NEXT TO EARTH.
AND OUR SUN IS 93 MILLION TIMES THE SIZE OF OUR EARTH.

SO ITS HARD FOR ME TO FIND WORTH.
AND THAT SUN IS JUS A STAR SON, ONE OF BILL-I-ONS.
MARRIED TO MY DREAMS LIKE MY CHRISTINA MILLIAN.
AS I LOOK UP IN THE STARS IN THE DIRECTION OF MARS.
YALL JUS WASTIN TIME WITH THOSE CONVENTIONAL BARS.
WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE NIGGA IT COULD PICK YOU APART.
YOU RAPPIN AND A BLOG GOT YOU THINKIN ITS ART.
WOULD YOU MIND TELLIN ME WHAT DID YOU THINK FROM THE START.
IM SHININ GOT YOU BLINKIN YOU CAN SQUINT FROM AFAR.
WHEN YOU SEE ME, I SEEN YA WHOLEJEALOUSY WHEN YOU SEEN ME.
I SEEN YOU, ACTIN LIKE YOU DIDNT EVEN SEE ME.
HATIN ASS NIGGAS THEY ALL WANNA BE ME.
FUCK IT, IM HEADED TO THE CAR TO GET WEEDED.
I JUS NEED THE GREEN OVERALL LIKE LUIGI.
Fuck it them shits was blue.
