Gangland Lyrics
by The Underachievers.


Stuff a 2'2 in my shoe.
My niggas out here never lack.
Watching hulu with your bitch with me she kick back and relax.
I smoke weed she do the smack.
Ronny J produced the track.
Nigga all about my karma.
You do action we react.
I bet these niggas pussy tell them watch they mouth.
I send them niggas to your crib like fuck your couch.
These bitches fucking for the fame and for the clout.
That's why we steady stacking like we in the drought.
I-N-D-I-G-O set, We to jungle fuck the feds.
Take your shot and try your best we aim at headsya fuck yo vests.
Texas hold'em by the neck, we don't lose, now place your bets.
Fuck you fools, and fuck yourselves.
We break rules, don't follow steps.
I get my niggas, they gone let them know.
Don't test the bros.
Niggas paper looking minimal, we getting more.
Niggas talk like they gone see me though , they layin low.
Bet that nigga let that semi go, now hit the flow.
GODAMN.
These niggas shooting in my city.
Gotta keep that thang up in me.
Even cops is fucking with it GODAMN.
I keep a couple bitches wit me.
I don't hang around wit niggas.
Unless they getting money wit me.
Yeah we started from the back.
Now we tour around the map.
Pull up on a nigga,Bet he gone get left right where he at.
Now it's 350 a sack.
I blow weed til I collapse.
Every night I say I quit.
But every morning I relapse.

Blue handkerchief nigga Gangland.
All my niggas know its gang bang.
AK he be on the same thing.
Took some psychedelics know my brain changed.
Young Rebellin money on my melon, shit we never managed now they see it.
Panties when we see them,.
in designer every season.
Smoking on the finest, bad bitches ride them all year.
Feel like perfect timing, homie get enlightened cause the truth inside you aww.
yeah.
No new friends just investors.
Had to lose lose the stress bring the pressure.
But im the fucking best, my confession.
When the nine sprays, hold it sideways.
Showing no face, can't arrest us.
So theres no case, had to change ways.
Find the lightwaves like tesla.
Throw the pen down like a wrestler.
I collect the cheese mozzarella.
The scripture says I'm illa.
Your frequencies fucked nigga.

I hit she screaming falcetto.
AK she love in the middle.
Only way you niggas trap.
is the Mental.
Boy you local and my game.
continental.
Told you once we don't play that my nigga.
Pay you twice we put a grave on that nigga.
Crypt reserver got your name on it.
Swerving and took her brain up off her.
