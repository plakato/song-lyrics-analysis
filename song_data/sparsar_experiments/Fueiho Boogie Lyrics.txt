Fueiho Boogie Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Oh, Club Flower, don't hold me down.
No, Romeo, no more romance.
They call the police, play all the hits.
It's four to the floor here, how could they resist?

Ooh, we're in the house of fun.
Ooh, we're gonna run and run.

Oh I don't know why you can't dance in Japan.
I hope that I can next time.

Oh! Tokyo! Don't stop the trance!
Ohh do the Fueiho boogie.
We'll dance for miles and miles.
Hear the 303 and break free, we won't stop at 12.
You can't divorce us from our style!

Ooh, we're in the house of fun.
Ooh, we're gonna run and run.
Ooh, we'll stay out tonight.
2x.
Ooh, we're gonna run and run.
3x.
3x.

Oh I don't know why you can't dance in Japan.
I hope that I can next time.
Oh I don't know why you can't dance in Japan.
I hope that I can next time.

We're in the house of fun.
We're in the house of fun.
We're gonna run and run.
We're gonna run and run.
We're gonna run and run.
We're gonna run and run.
We're gonna run and run.
We're gonna run and run.
And stay out tonight.
We're in the house of fun.
We're in the house of fun.
