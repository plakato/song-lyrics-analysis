Designated Driver Lyrics
by The Swellers.

Woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
Cause I'm the only one who sleeps in it.
Last night I tested my investment.
What the fire in my chest meant.
The blizzard helped me understand.
That you let me down again.
That you let me down again.
I know you want me to forget.
I know you want me to forget.
Twenty miles and thirty-two degrees.
I hoped the warmth would bring you to your knees.
Last night proved to be an adjustment.
Against my better judgement.
Cleaning up for drunken friends.
I must have slipped your mind again.
I must have slipped your mind again.
I know you want me to forget.
I know you want me to forget.
Where you want to be is right in front of me, and that's okay.
I know you want me to forget.
Forget.
Last night I tested my investment.
What the fire in my chest meant.
No flame lasts when you're this cold.
I'll keep my shoulder to the road.
Would you even know?
I know you want me to forget.
I know you want me to forget.
Where you want to be.
Is right in front of me.
And that's okay.
I know you want me to forget.
Forget. Forget.
