Drop It Lyrics
by Wonder Broz.


She gon' drop it on me.
Drop it on me, girl.
Do it like that.
Girl you wanna leave.
You finna win me.
Keep moving like that.
Drop it for a real nigga.
Drop it for a real.
Drop it for a real nigga.
Huh.

They all know, know me.
Two braids, east side, long beach.
Everybody in the town my homies.
But the way you get it you my only.
Got the kid horn add a Y.
Treat her like my child.
Keep her and my side.
I rock that thang like a lullaby.
She my loan, no cosigner.
Get it, if not it's all good.
I like 'em ghetto, straight from the hood.
I'll save that thing she misunderstood.
No question bout it, I know I would.
Mommy hips made for a hula hoop.
She on tonight them hips don't lie they tell the truth.
When she dip look what the booty do.
Her and her friend they ?

Hold on, grab tight.
Hips like handle bars on motorbikes.
She alright, she cool.
I seen better, nigga who?
Sike I play that roll.
It's my joy stick so I'm in control.
Hit her with that D make her offense fold.
Best offense is your D, know she know.
Right?
That stank don't it.
She act like she don't but that cat want it.
Got her man yelling, I be dog on it.
He mad 'cuz he see the dog on it.
It is what it is, got her wanting the jizz.
Mami got a taste for the kids.
I ain't judging her bizz, now he know it ain't his.
Scratch him off the list.
