Why We Live Here Lyrics
by Tyler Farr.

Got an alright house and a pretty nice yard.
A screen door dog that stays on guard.
Got a buddy up the road that's got my back.
â€˜Round here it ain't hard to find folks like that.

Got a gun and a Bible by my bed.
Try to live by the words in red.
I ain't got a lot but I got enough.
By God I believe in God we trust.

That's why, why we live here.
Damn right we ain't going anywhere.
Home of the brave, baseball, and cold beer.
It's pretty clear.
That's why we live here.

Seeing things he wished he didn't see.
Picture of his wife tucked in his vest.
Fighting a fight we ain't finished yet.

That's why, why we live here.
Damn right we ain't going anywhere.
Home of the brave, baseball, and cold beer.
It's pretty clear.
That's why we live here, yeah.

Whether your road is dirt or paved.
Red, white, and blue, we're all the same.

That's why, why we live here.
You damn right we ain't going anywhere.
Home of the brave, baseball, and ice cold beer.
It's pretty clear.
That's why we live here.
