Do The Funky Chicken Lyrics
by Rufus Thomas.

Y'all come on in now, come right on down front.
I got something I want to show you.
Now y'all heard of the Popcorn, y'all heard of the Dog.
You heard about all your other dances.

But now there's a brand new dance.
That's going around.
I want to show you exactly what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about the funky chicken, y'all ready?
I say y'all ready, okay, here we go.

You raise the left arm up and your right arm too.
Let me tell you just what to do, start both of 'em to flapping.
Start your feet to kicking, that's when you know.
You doin' the funky chicken.

Slick and spasm, you got both arms up, across your face.
You knees start wiggling, all over the place.
You flap your arms and your feet start kicking.
Then you know you doin' the funky chicken.

Oh, I'm feeling it now, I feel so unnecessary.
This is the kind, this is the kind of stuff.
To make you feel like you want to do something nasty.
Like waste some chicken gravy on your white shirt.
Right down front, here we go y'all.

You work both arms and you work both feet.
Use a dab of gravy, you right on the beat.
You flap your arms and your feet start kicking.
The you know you doin' the funky chicken.

Doin' the funky chicken, y'all.
Doin' the funky chicken, y'all.
Doin' the funky chicken, y'all.
