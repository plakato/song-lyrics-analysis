Lost in NY Lyrics
by Ry.


It's been a long year wonder where you've been/.
But all of this time you were there with me/.
There with me now, you were there with me/.

So when you make the table can you save a place/.
And if the food gets cold, can you save a plate/.
Save a plate for me, you were there with me/.

And she said/.

The front door stays open, and i know it ain't snowing/.
But i'm kinda in the mood to see a christmas movie tonight/.
… with you by my side/.

And what do we feel like watching? Let it be Malculy Culkin/.
And we're both home alone so i'm feeling like i'm lost in NY/.
… with you by my side, you by my side now/.

December 24, just me and the stars/.
Reminiscing on the year, barely noticed it passed/.
Not bad for the kid, who was the clown of the class/.
Don't mean to toot my own horn, so I wrote you a card/.

I'm standing at the door, see my cousin's arrivin'/.
I'm visiting the home, where they still call me ryan/.
Don't think this visits quick, they bout to be here all night man/.
Mums on the phone, other hand on frying pan/.

Standing with my old man, preparing the playlist/.
Springsteen on, maybe some miles davis/.
We spent the entire year working for payslips/.
Me and my tunnel vision yeah just like them reindeers/.

I told you one day I'll play festival hall/.
I'll be on the same stage they saw Lennon perform/.

Let me thank my fans now just for all their support/.
When I make the radio, I'm bout give you a call/.

Yeah, a miracle on 34th street/.
My parents put the presents out when we'd fall asleep/.
I was 8, roller blades and a frisby/.
Leave the game boy at home, I ain't taking it with me/.

I remember as a kid watching carols on nine/.
We can decorate the tree maybe give it some lights/.
Ry be careful where you're stepping just don't walk on the vine/.
It looks awesome from the window, still it took you all night/.

Damn, I hoped my sister wouldn't get better presents?!/ But.
On the real, I couldn't get better parents/.
Despite the discussions, despite all the fussing and fighting,.
I ain't talking I'm just keeping it private/.

One day I'm going make it I'mma buy you the world/.
Picket fences and a house you'll have diamonds and pearls/.
'Cos it still trips me out people give me applause/.
I do this for my fans, my fan base are like my based gods/.

Ain't nothing like December Night's/ Hell Yeah/.
I ain't religious, but Jesus Christ/ Amen/.
I worked so hard and we're eating tonight/.
And I can do anything if you're there by my Side/ I Said/.
