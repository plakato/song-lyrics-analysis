Oh My Darling Don't Cry Lyrics
by Run the Jewels.


Oh my.
Oh my.

Fuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp.
Hol up.

Fuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp.
I don't fuck with or talk like all these fuckin' imps.
Style violent, give a fuck if you deny it, kids.
You can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks.
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit, that's word to B.I.G.
I dreamt we owned the world, but I've woken up and it don't exist.
Soak it in, I.
need no assist,you can't slap my wrist, I don't owe you shit.
Trust me, I'm a Doctor DOOM, oper-rate of my pulse, won't raise a bit.

Tip-toe on the track like a ballerina, ski mask, in a Pontiac Catalina.
It's obese, female opera singer,you can run the jewels or lose your fingers.
Me and El-P got time to kill, got folks to kill, on overkill.
He hangin' out the window, I hold the wheel, one black, one white, we shoot.
to kill.
That fuckboy life about to be repealed, that fuckboy shit about to be.
repelled.
Fuckboy Jihad, kill infidels, Allah Akbar, BOOM, from Mike and El.

Life is hell, death's a bitch, and these fubar rulers getting rich.
I cop a zip, it opens up, I smoke it up, go home and fuck.
C'est la vie girl, when in Rome, I gave the face, please pay with dome.
My business card says, You're in luck, I do two things, I rap and fuck.


I fuck and rap, I tote the strap, I smoke the kush, I beat the puss.
I read the books, did the math,don't need a preacher preachin' on my behalf.
No teacher can teach my arrogant ass,I'm blowin' on crippy while readin' inscriptions.
That's written by Egyptians, and sippin' on whiskey, aye baby, you with me.
?

Oh my.
Don't cry.

Whip Crack!We.
run this spot like a Chinese sweatshop.
Don't stop, work it, work it 'til chest pop - Cardiac arrested.
I'm so invested,I'm self-invented, that's no illusion, there's no.
confusion.
You see the future, you fear the future, I've seen the truth and I'm so.
deluded.
I've! Been a better bad guy than I been, better than bad.
Been a bit a bully talk, beating on my chest, in fact.
I'm a half stack from a rack,I been around the block, babe, I know a few facts.
Maniac, brainiac, run, go tell them that, ATLien, NY felon rap.

Handle me wrong I'm snappin', show up at your class, what's happenin'?
Schoolyard bully with a fully automatic, heart full of pain and a head full.
of havoc.
Everybody stepped on the kid and I'm letting them have it.
Havoc, leaving.
they momma to say, What happened!?
Who gon' buy my baby a casket? Fuck that bitch, I'm a bastard.

Megablast, I'm mega lit, on Highway 6 and I'm not strapped in.
I don't crash, bitch, I just skid,you got the cash? I'll make the trip.
I make the trip, you better pay, done worse for less, don't make my day.
I'm not from Earth, from far away, I bust through chests like baby greys.

Runnin' the jewels of the game, whippin' the mix is like chickens of 'caine.

Spittin' the sentence again, parents is livid again, kids is just fuckin'.
insane.
Pointin' that pistol and fist for the chain, reppin' the symbol like they in a.
gang.
Delivery dope like a dosage of dope or a noseful of coke for a junkie or.
fiend.

Oh my.
Don't cry.
