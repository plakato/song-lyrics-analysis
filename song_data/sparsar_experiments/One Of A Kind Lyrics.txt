One Of A Kind Lyrics
by VonMar.


I just like my dope smoke.
She roll one, I roll four.
Slow driving down Lakeshore.
She one of a kind.
Swear this shit blowing my mind.
And she get me every time.

Mary Jane, I put a ring on her.
Put me in a coffin when I pull out them racks on 'em.
I just want the money, cuh, the fame, no off and on.
Pop a few shots, drunk lean.
Ain't no stopping us.
Thotboyz, TNT, everybody wanna.
copy us.
From the east, to the west.
Everybody straight matching something.
Face the blunt, now I'm back where I lay.
Bitches wanna smoke, can't tell 'em where I stay.
Cause everybody down, I know I ain't safe.
I gotta keep that strap.
Young nigga with that bag.
Smoking and popping them tabs.
Everybody wanna live fast.
Ho, fast ain't safe.
Everybody say they loud man, no way.
Money on my mind all day, big safe.
Everybody said I couldn't do it shitfaced.
Put 'em in a coffin, roll up,.
straight fakes.
Surrounded by the baddest, but they love me for the cake.
My whole team me, can't trust no fakes.
She rolling up with me, we face, she face.
