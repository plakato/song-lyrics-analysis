Circles of love (d&s radio mix) Lyrics
by Xperience.

From the album:.
Magic fields.
Circles of love turn my head.
I deserve and I'll get.
All your lovin' tonight.
And my fire will burn.
Innocence won't return.
Innocence won't return.
We dance in the desert.
I feel a glance of your eye.
The sun is burning on the sand.
Yearning bodies hand in hand.
Circles of love turn my head.
I deserve and I'll get.
All your lovin' tonight.
And my fire will burn.
Innocence won't return.
Innocence won't return.
Your face across the far sky.
I loose myself in your eyes.
I'm counting nights and days.
Waiting for the next embrace.
Circles of love turn my head.
I deserve and I'll get.
All your lovin' tonight.
And my fire will burn.
Innocence won't return.
Innocence won't return.
Circles of love turn my head.
I deserve and I'll get.
All your lovin' tonight.
And my fire will burn.
Innocence won't return.
Innocence won't return.
I realize you drive.
Me crazy in my mind.
Love came face to face with life.
All emotions in my mind.
I try to cover try to hide.
I try to cover try to hide.
Circles of love turn my head.
I deserve and I'll get.
All your lovin' tonight.
And my fire will burn.
Innocence won't return.
Innocence won't return.
Circles of love turn my head.
I deserve and I'll get.
All your lovin' tonight.
And my fire will burn.
Innocence won't return.
Innocence won't return.
