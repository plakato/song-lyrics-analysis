I Ain't Shit Lyrics
by SwaVay.

Stay focused.
That's P-H.
O-C.
Yeah, yeah.
U-Z.
Yeah.
E-D.
Yeah.
That's for my brother, free my brother ya'll.
Nah I Ain't Shit.
Yeah, No I Ain't Shit.
Yeah, look.

And these days.
I'm always on pursuit.
Of happiness.
My locks lueked.
SwaVay Badu.
And my daddy is.
In the same state now.
But still never call.
I stopped taking halls.
Now voice is going through withdraws.
This is Nas after writing Illmatic.
If it didn't blow.
Learned it ain't about talent.
It's just bout who you know.
Tired of these stupid shows.
Cause I been giving stupid flows.
I'm tired of every song being bout some stupid groupie hoes.
Like what's a flex zone?
Ain't heard of dat.
Thought we was saying hip hop.
Where the conserves at?
Seen a white kid online.
With some jays and a bucket hat.
Say he trap god.
You ever heard of that?
Not me.
Used to think no one could stop me.
But they buy into these wack raps.
No one cop me.
Produce for Hadi.
Boy I hope he got me.
But now a days.
I just hope somebody pop me.
So I get can get away from earth;.
Been cursed since birthed.
They ripping out my heart.
You just can't see it on my shirt.
I'm just a little shit in the egg ready to burst.
And if I come out alive.
I stick my middle finger first.
To show much pain that with time i gain.
Half of these rappers really don't even deserve the fame.
But I talking out of spite.
I ain't tryna complain.
But let me wrinkle your brain.
While I go cobain.
You see my girl is a cheater.
And my passion is a dreamer.
And if the devil is a bitch.
I hope I never meet her.
I wish I could sue the world for my life.
Where my subpoena?
They gon' have to kill me stop speaking.
Selena.
But R.I.P.
To my rap career and my R&amp;B.
Just saying.
If I die today.
I'd be the best.
Arguably.
Though they never charted me.
The team never started me.
I still spoke my mind.
I was like a star to me.
I heard cole say he hate rich niggas.
What?
Rich niggas dissing rich niggas.
Nigga what?
You rich nigga!
Oh my God this nigga.
What?
You RICH NIGGA , Dissin' YO NIGGAS.
What the fuck?
Nah I don't feel that.
But that's my favorite rapper.
So respect.
But its too many rappers.
So I'm coming for they neck.
One by one.
Set by set, and.
Life it happens my nigga.
Bruh, you get what you get.
But don't listen to me.
Cause I ain't shit.
Nah I ain't shit.
I Ain't Shit.
I ain't shit.

Yeah.
This for my brother bruh.
Real though.
You can sleep that time though.
Keep your head up my nigga.
When you get out, we gon' be on.

I Ain't Shit.

You can tell my mother, I ain't shit.
You can tell my brother, I ain't shit.
You can tell my daddy, I ain't shit.
