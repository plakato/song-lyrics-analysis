Spanish Sahara Lyrics
by Queen of Hearts.

So walked into the haze.
In a million dirty waves.
Now I see you laying back.
Like a loosing air, air.

Black clouds in the sand.
Still there someone I cannot bear.
And I wipe the sun from my eye.
Spanish sahara the place that you wanna.

Leave the horror here.
Forget the horror here.
Forget the horror here.
Leave it all down here.
It's future rust and it's future dust.

Now the waves they track you down.
Carry you to broken grounds.
Though I find you the sun.
Wipe the clean with dirty hands.
So got down this spoiling space.
Cause spanish sahara the place that you wanna.

Leave the horror here.
Forget the horror here.
Forget the horror here.
Leave it all down here.
It's future rust and it's future dust.

I'm the fury in your head.
I'm the fury in your back.
I'm the ghost in the back of your head.
Cause I am.
