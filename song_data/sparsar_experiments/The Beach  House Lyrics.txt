The Beach  House Lyrics
by ViZion.


Tight jeans and white tees, she rock those.
Hot heels on her feet, like she's on a stove.
Just hit my dealer for some trees, so I gotta smoke.
Yea I'm ready for this week, picture me and see me roll.
Waking and baking, I meditate.
Herbs for the nerves so you know I gotta medicate.
Call them hors d'oeuvres, I'm cooking up a hell a' plate.
Shes say she love it, Michelin should give me star ratings.
Cause I'm doing great things.
When I'm top of her no stopping her legs shaking.
No it's not a race, cause she can win, again and again.
I'm living life in the moment, never knowing when it ends.

Laugh, we smoke, we fly.
Joke, we kiss, we cry.
It's just her and I.
At the beach house on the weekend.
Fight, we're breaking up.
At night we're making love.
I just can't get enough.
At the beach house on the weekend.

Surf's up, big waves all day.
Morning session, all blue around me like I'm on a plane.
She's on the beach in Victoria Secret, rocking shades.
Top down, like a Lamborghini, hot as flames.
East coast, all alone.
Hold her close, keep her warm.
Never let go, wanna overdose.
When I'm all up in her, it's just us and then the stars below.
Memories I'm taking with me, through my music.
I'm photographing the moment so I don't lose it.
If I could take her on the jet, then I'd do it.
But I gotta go, gotta go my life's a movement.

Laugh, we smoke, we fly.
Joke, we kiss, we cry.
It's just her and I.
At the beach house on the weekend.
Fight, we're breaking up.
At night we're making love.
I just can't get enough.
At the beach house on the weekend.

Holding her, loving the moment.
Sun setting over the coast and.
Even if I wasn't high.
I'd still be zoning and floating.
Chilling and kicking it, jonesing.
Legitimitely, my girl is rolling.
And she'll be coming around.
Even when I'm over the oceans.

Laugh, we smoke, we fly.
Joke, we kiss, we cry.
It's just her and I.
At the beach house on the weekend.
Fight, we're breaking up.
At night we're making love.
I just can't get enough.
At the beach house on the weekend.
