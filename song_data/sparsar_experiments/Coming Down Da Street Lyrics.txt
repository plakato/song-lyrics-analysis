Coming Down Da Street Lyrics
by UNK.


I'M comin down the street beatin on these hoes 
Switchin lane to lane Chevy sittin on 24's 
Got TV's everywhurr. That purp' is in the urr 
Plus, I'm ridin dirty. So you know that I don't curr 
 
Unk 
Ay, I'm comin down the street rollin and smokin'dro 
St.. Louis and Mosley Park, big bodies and bike shows 
But dey can't fuck with mine, candy coated apple red 
Touch, a button screens spill, there's Paris, Hilton givin, head 
Hey. While I was gettin some head, I like to swerve to the curb 
At my back boys in the blue, say they protect and they serve 
Watchin me swerve on this purp'. I put two shots in the air: 
Big ol' spray, fresh fruit, no kush, nowhere, 
I got them big boy, rims on the big boy, whip, 
I rock them big boy chains; stackin, big boy chips, 
Fo'-fifty rocket unlock it. My bass, stay punchin like Rocky 
Hit, hit hit. It then I'm gone beat'n down yo block. You can't stop me. 
 
Loko 
I'm beat'n down yo' block comin with tremendous knock 
See me. I'M fly on 26's systems, bitches keep spinnin. When I stop 
Yup, I got that drop, but jackers got that Glock 
Come through when you see Big Oomp cause. You know I got ta, get that guac' 
I'm Simpson Road in a Simpson Road, Chevy, 
Sprayed, Simpson, Road green, just like the street sign. Do you feel me 
Fo'-fifty-fo' motor under the hood, so you know I'm runnin 
Got the traction when I'm mashin wheels smokin rubber, burnin 
You, don't wan na race, my nigga, don't you try 
Blowin pipes, oh so loud, but my engine? Oh so quiet 
You know I'm in a big boy kit, with that flip-flop chameleon 
Diamonds and the sun shinin got my Caddy back glistenin 
 
Unk 
Nope~
