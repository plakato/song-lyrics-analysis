Wulf Takahashi Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


I pull up screamin' nigga, we no equal to you 
And. Just because you see us smokin', don't think we slippin' for you 
I caught yo bitch in my DM's tryna link for a few 
Code phrase. She tryna fuck. She had emojis included 
I on't fuck with niggas. That'S why I stay so reclusive 
If. He ever pull up on me. I'Mma get so abusive. 
I buy a box of backwoods rip, em up and abuse em 
She say. Can I roll one? I said Bitch, you don't know what you doin
' 
Boy. It'S only me with no emotions included 
It'ont. Take that much for me to fade to black and go prove it 
I, don't give no fuck bout. What whoever and them doin' 
I got fifty shades of grey. They fade to black. If I lose it. 
I'M smokin' seven blunts, while I cut up intruders, 
Ryosuke Takahashi, don't even know how I do it. 
See me smokin' special zips and that's just how I'mma do it 
If? He think he high as me. I just look down and say: prove it 
I pull up S13. Then pull off on a loser 
Now! She in S14 tryna find a link to my music 
Then. I said That's too easy hop online and just Google it. 
Then. She say Yeah you right now she get wet when she do it 
Why these niggas think I'm lyin'. I say pull up and prove it 
Excuse my taste, but I think I'm more honest than you is 
These rappers still a joke. Let me be honest: like Goodfriend 
See haters gettin' mad cause, they ain't got no accomplishments. 
Wulf Takahashi leave your posse in piss 
And. When I get to Europe, they treat your boy like a prince 
See me leavin', jealous niggas in a shit-lit trench. 
Call me Jim Wulf Lahey
while. I sit here and sip 
You bitch
