Wulf Takahashi Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


I pull up screamin' nigga we no equal to you.
And just because you see us smokin' don't think we slippin' for you.
I caught yo bitch in my DM's tryna link for a few.
Code phrase she tryna fuck she had emojis included.
I on't fuck with niggas that's why I stay so reclusive.
If he ever pull up on me I'mma get so abusive.
I buy a box of backwoods, rip em up and abuse em.
She say Can I roll one? I said Bitch, you don't know what you doin.
'!
Boy it's only me with no emotions included.
It'ont take that much for me to fade to black and go prove it.
I don't give no fuck bout what whoever and them doin'.
I got fifty shades of grey, they fade to black if I lose it.
I'm smokin' seven blunts while I cut up intruders.
Ryosuke Takahashi don't even know how I do it.
See me smokin' special zips and that's just how I'mma do it.
If he think he high as me I just look down and say prove it.
I pull up S13 then pull off on a loser.
Now she in S14 tryna find a link to my music.
Then I said That's too easy, hop online and just Google it..
Then she say Yeah you right, now she get wet when she do it.
Why these niggas think I'm lyin'? I say pull up and prove it.
Excuse my taste but I think I'm more honest than you is.
These rappers still a joke let me be honest like Goodfriend.
See haters gettin' mad cause they ain't got no accomplishments.
Wulf Takahashi leave your posse in piss.
And when I get to Europe they treat your boy like a prince.
See me leavin' jealous niggas in a shit-lit trench.
Call me Jim Wulf Lahey.
while I sit here and sip.
You bitch.
