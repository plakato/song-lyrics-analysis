Bad Influence Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


I was always told I'm a bad influence.
Your daughter's life I will ruin.
Brewing up a plan.
Just to get inside her pants.
What I'm doin.
Then I zip them things up and find a new one.
Stealing what ain't mine.
Before this younging start suing.
Get the crew involved, Menthols.
Until she blue in the face it's amazing.
I know she wish she brought her mace, said her grace, started praying.
Told I'm a bad influence.
Cuz it's hell in a handbag.
When I interact, it's like cinemac.
In hindsight she'll know if the times right.
Before she had a chance to say sike.
Her hair pulled back, getting smacked.
Can't be tamed, hotboxin in the stang.
Banging on the rag top, til she gag stop.
Cherry in her vag popped, bop, she was on top.
Dampened, call me Manson.
We in an abandoned Mansion.
My move, I made her skip school.
Cancelled Hampton, running.
rampant.
Off on a tangent.
Sneaked out, on our way to Quis house, she freaked out.
We landed, she asking where my manz is.
In the party dancing.
I took her to a room with the Uth, had to split.
Passed the spliff then I dipped.
She stayin with group.
Assortment of blends.
Spent a day with me, now a master at the chem.
Far from timid.
Don't let her meet that nigga Chuck Nimbus.
Doesn't know her limit.
Got a call when they finished.
Explaining what the deal is.
Ain't know what to think.
All I heard was blood, bathroom, and sink.
Instinct was T.O.M. paid a visit.
But the outcome, it was more than sunshine and kisses.
Poster child for our dopest, loud, album.
How come the title's what it is...

We turned a cute girl bad that's a Beautiful Sin.

Pop it, Pop it, Sniff it, Smoke it.
Smoke it, Pop it.

Pop it, Sniff it, Smoke it.
Smoke it, Smoke it.
Smoke it.
Pop it, Sniff it, Smoke it.
Smoke it.

And if we pop a couple Xannies then you know we good.
