I Only Came For You Lyrics
by Wood.

Have I been fooled by wishes.
The room turned misty blue.
I'm fast asleep in Kansas.
From a dream come true.
And I, I, I only came for you.
I don't want anything that happens.
And we just hold it here.
Somebody go and fetch your father.
I see it all so clear.
Have I been taken over.
I dream I'd have a clue.
I'm feeling less than sober.
Are you there way to.
And I, I, I only came for you.
Have I been fooled by wishes.
I dream I'd have a clue.
I'm fast asleep in Kansas.
I only came for you.
