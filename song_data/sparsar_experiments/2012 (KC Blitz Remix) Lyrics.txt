2012 (KC Blitz Remix) Lyrics
by The Word Alive.

You get what you deserve for fucking with me.
You get what you deserve for fucking with me.

You're not the first, you won't be the last.
Your days are numbered so make them last.

No one will recognize me.
A new face, a cold heart to stand in your way.

I know I said you'd be okay.
Forgiveness won't come your way.
Well I lied, it's time you fucking die.
You've dug your grave, it's time that you pay.

No one will recognize me.
A new face, a cold heart to stand in your way.
No one will recognize me.
A new face, a cold heart to make you break.

I'll finish you!
I'll finish you!
I'll finish you!

You thought you could get away.
And you thought you could escape.
Your time is up.
You can't hide from me.

No one will recognize me.
A new face, a cold heart to stand in your way.
Now this is what you get for taking my life away.
You can't run away.
