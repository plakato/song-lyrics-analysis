Hyaku No Tabu (One Hundred Tabs) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


Now you already know I ain't gon' tell a lie.
Cause I ain't never been that kind of type of guy.
I'm smokin' weed trynna get some more.
Lil bro you shoulda know that your bitch a hoe.
She on my Instagram likin' shit.
And i don't even fuckin follow the bitch.
She textin you but she here with me.
Trynna fuck on me, hoe get off of me.
I do not give the dick for free.
Now this bitch getting married me.
I told her chill n smoke some fuckin tree.
But she looked at me and said I'm too horny.

DMT up in my glass, LSD a hundred tabs.
Hundred bitches on my dick, cause I'm lookin like the man.
DMT up in my glass, LSD a hundred tabs.
Hundred hoes on me, cause I'm lookin like the man.
