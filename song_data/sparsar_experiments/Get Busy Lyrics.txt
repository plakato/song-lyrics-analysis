Get Busy Lyrics
by The Wow.

KO THE LEGEND.

I get busy, I do work.
Icon bitch I'm feelin' like I'm Kool Herc.
Brand new pants, brand new shirt.
I blew purp, so I'm lookin for a few skirts.
That all wanna get busy.
And take shots 'til they all feel dizzy.
Ballin' dog, no Spuds Mckenzie.
The new benzie, got them bitches all in a frenzy.

Get busy y'all.
Get busy y'all.

KO THE LEGEND.

I'm gettin' busy like I'm runnin' errands.
Cuz I'm flyer than a pair of his and her Mclarens.
I got steez, see the creez, check out my appearance.
She callin' me daddy and I ain't gotta meet the parents.
Six blunts, I'm dyin' to get to seven.
She said preach, and I ain't even a reverend.
You want the throne I'm tryin' to be a legend.
And I ain't even waitin' in line to get to heaven.
So what I look like waitin' outside of Greystone.
You cats is behind the times like a pay phone.
I'm all V-I-P everything.
Married to the game I don't need a wedding ring.
Smokin' loud packs, puffin' on them green acres.
Gettin' busy like a couple horny teenagers.
Been in the game, but I'm new to y'all.
Six million ways to die and you can use 'em all.
