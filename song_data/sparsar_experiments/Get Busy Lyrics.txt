Get Busy Lyrics
by The Wow.

Ko THE LEGEND 
 
I get busy. I do work 
Icon bitch, I'm feelin', like I'm Kool Herc 
Brand new pants brand new shirt. 
I blew purp, so I'm lookin for a few skirts. 
That all wan na get busy 
And take shots'til. They all feel dizzy. 
Ballin' dog! No Spuds Mckenzie 
The new benzie got them bitches all in a frenzy 
 
Get busy, y'all 
Get busy, y'all 
 
 KO THE LEGEND 
 
I'm gettin' busy, like I'm runnin' errands 
Cuz, I'm flyer than a pair of his and her Mclarens 
I got steez, see the Creez check out my appearance, 
She callin' me daddy and I ain't got ta meet the parents, 
Six blunts, I'm dyin' to get to seven 
She said preach and I ain't. Even a reverend 
You want the throne, I'm tryin' to be a legend 
And. I ain't even waitin'. In line to get to heaven 
So what I look like waitin' outside of Greystone 
You cats, is behind the times like a pay phone, 
I'm, all V-I-P everything 
Married to the game. I don't need a wedding ring, 
Smokin' loud packs, puffin' on them. Green acres, 
Gettin' busy like a couple horny teenagers 
Been in the game, but I'm new to y'all, 
Six million ways to die and you can use'em all
