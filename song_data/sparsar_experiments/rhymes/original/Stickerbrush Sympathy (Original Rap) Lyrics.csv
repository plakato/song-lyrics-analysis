a;0;im reminded of the somber years;ay_m r_iy_m_ay_n_d_ah_d ah_v dh_ah s_aa_m_b_er y_ih_r_z
a;1;especially last summer where a knot appeared;ah_s_p_eh_sh_l_iy l_ae_s_t s_ah_m_er w_eh_r ah n_aa_t ah_p_ih_r_d
b;2;in every rope of all I was involved with yeah;ih_n eh_v_er_iy r_ow_p ah_v ao_l ay w_ah_z ih_n_v_aa_l_v_d w_ih_dh y_ae
c;3;desires were demolished and my thoughts were never positive;d_ah_z_ay_r_z w_er d_ih_m_aa_l_ih_sh_t ah_n_d m_ay th_ao_t_s w_er n_eh_v_er p_aa_z_ah_t_ih_v
d;4;while problems were resolved without involving any common sense;w_ay_l p_r_aa_b_l_ah_m_z w_er r_iy_z_aa_l_v_d w_ih_th_aw_t ih_n_v_aa_l_v_ih_ng eh_n_iy k_aa_m_ah_n s_eh_n_s
e;6;pandemonium grew bitterness ensued;p_ae_n_d_ah_m_ow_n_iy_ah_m g_r_uw b_ih_t_er_n_ah_s eh_n_s_uw_d
e;7;while living with the want of getting out of town when I knew;w_ay_l l_ih_v_ih_ng w_ih_dh dh_ah w_aa_n_t ah_v g_eh_t_ih_ng aw_t ah_v t_aw_n hh_w_ih_n ay n_y_uw
e;8;it wasn-t the smartest direction I could choose;ah_t w_oh_z_n_t dh_ah s_m_aa_r_t_ah_s_t d_ih_r_eh_k_sh_n ay k_uh_d ch_uw_z
e;9;it just didn-t seem practical but then soon;ih_t jh_ah_s_t d_ih_d_n_t s_iy_m p_r_ae_k_t_ah_k_ah_l b_ah_t dh_eh_n s_uw_n
f;11;breakdown;b_r_ey_k_d_aw_n
d;12;i felt forgotten and depressed;ay f_eh_l_t f_ao_r_g_aa_t_ah_n ah_n_d d_ah_p_r_eh_s_t
d;13;and couldn-t conquer all this stress;ah_n_d k_uh_d_n_t k_aa_ng_k_er ao_l dh_ih_s s_t_r_eh_s
n;14;that resulted from remembering;dh_ae_t r_ih_z_ah_l_t_ih_d f_r_ah_m r_ah_m_eh_m_b_er_ih_ng
d;15;why I was there;w_ay ay w_ah_z dh_eh_r
d;17;my purpose seemed so pathetic;m_ay p_er_p_ah_s s_iy_m_d s_ow p_ah_th_eh_t_ih_k
d;18;i was searching everywhere;ay w_ah_z s_er_ch_ih_ng eh_v_r_iy_w_eh_r
o;19;to feel like I belonged;t_uw f_iy_l l_ay_k ay b_ah_l_ao_ng_d
d;20;when I thought nobody cared;w_eh_n ay th_ao_t n_ow_b_aa_d_iy k_eh_r_d
p;22;but hold on hold up wait a minute;b_ah_t hh_ow_l_d aa_n hh_ow_l_d ah_p w_ey_t ah m_ih_n_ih_t
c;23;can I conquer these negative thoughts when my reality hasn-t improved a lot;k_ah_n ay k_aa_ng_k_er dh_iy_z n_eh_g_ah_t_ih_v th_ao_t_s w_eh_n m_ay r_iy_ae_l_ah_t_iy hh_ae_z_ah_n_t ih_m_p_r_uw_v_d ah l_aa_t
g;24;i guess when I think about it I seem to surround;ay g_eh_s w_eh_n ay th_ih_ng_k ah_b_aw_t ih_t ay s_iy_m t_uw s_er_aw_n_d
q;25;my doubts around excuses when I should be moving on and;m_ay d_aw_t_s er_aw_n_d ih_k_s_k_y_uw_s_ih_z w_eh_n ay sh_uh_d b_iy m_uw_v_ih_ng aa_n ah_n_d
b;27;today Im changing this pattern;t_ah_d_ey ay_m ch_ey_n_jh_ih_ng dh_ih_s p_ae_t_er_n
f;28;i know Im capable of greatness;ay n_ow ay_m k_ey_p_ah_b_ah_l ah_v g_r_ey_t_n_ah_s
p;29;even if you doubt that Ill make it;iy_v_ah_n ah_f y_uw d_aw_t dh_ae_t ay_l m_ey_k ih_t
r;30;out of my current situation;aw_t ah_v m_ay k_ah_r_ax_n_t s_ih_ch_uw_ey_sh_ah_n
h;32;i won-t let go of all the dreams;ay w_ow_n_t l_eh_t g_ow ah_v ao_l dh_ah d_r_iy_m_z
c;33;i have because of a few problems;ay hh_ae_v b_ih_k_ao_z ah_v ah f_y_uw p_r_aa_b_l_ah_m_z
g;34;its frustrating how;ih_t_s f_r_ah_s_t_r_ey_t_ih_ng hh_aw
g;35;these doubts seem to weigh me down;dh_iy_z d_aw_t_s s_iy_m t_uw w_ey m_iy d_aw_n
g;37;so Im standing up to them now;s_ow ay_m s_t_ae_n_d_ih_ng ah_p t_uw dh_eh_m n_aw
s;39;ill muster up the strength;ay_l m_ah_s_t_er ah_p dh_ah s_t_r_eh_ng_k_th
f;40;somehow Ill let go of my mistakes;s_ah_m_hh_aw ay_l l_eh_t g_ow ah_v m_ay m_ih_s_t_ey_k_s
t;42;i used to chase True Love but it once never occurred to me;ay y_uw_z_d t_uw ch_ey_s t_r_uw l_ah_v b_ah_t ih_t w_ah_n_s n_eh_v_er ah_k_er_d t_uw m_iy
t;43;that it wasn-t the key to fulfill any insecurity;dh_ae_t ih_t w_oh_z_n_t dh_ah k_iy t_uw f_uh_l_f_ih_l eh_n_iy ih_n_s_ih_k_y_uh_r_ah_t_iy
u;44;a person can-t fully supply love because we are imperfect;ah p_er_s_ah_n k_ae_n_t f_uh_l_iy s_ah_p_l_ay l_ah_v b_ih_k_ao_z w_iy aa_r ih_m_p_er_f_ih_k_t
t;45;and wired to need each other sometimes that idea worries me;ah_n_d w_ay_er_d t_uw n_iy_d iy_ch ah_dh_er s_ah_m_t_ay_m_z dh_ae_t ay_d_iy_ah w_er_iy_z m_iy
a;47;cause all I seem to chase (is) someone else-s recognition;k_aa_z ao_l ay s_iy_m t_uw ch_ey_s ih_z s_ah_m_w_ah_n eh_l_s_ah_z r_eh_k_ah_g_n_ih_sh_ah_n
a;48;(as) if that certain somebody would affirm my existence;ae_z ah_f dh_ae_t s_er_t_ah_n s_ah_m_b_aa_d_iy w_uh_d ah_f_er_m m_ay eh_g_z_ih_s_t_ah_n_s
f;49;then I could finally be happy but what does this entail;dh_eh_n ay k_uh_d f_ay_n_ah_l_iy b_iy hh_ae_p_iy b_ah_t w_ah_t d_ah_z dh_ih_s eh_n_t_ey_l
f;50;relying on words when they inevitably will fail;r_iy_l_ay_ih_ng aa_n w_er_d_z w_eh_n dh_ey ih_n_eh_v_ah_t_ah_b_l_iy w_ah_l f_ey_l
w;52;and I cannot remember;ah_n_d ay k_ae_n_aa_t r_ih_m_eh_m_b_ax
i;53;what confidence once looked like;w_ah_t k_aa_n_f_ah_d_ah_n_s w_ah_n_s l_uh_k_t l_ay_k
a;54;my dreams are in the distance;m_ay d_r_iy_m_z aa_r ih_n dh_ah d_ih_s_t_ah_n_s
i;55;when they used to be by my side;w_eh_n dh_ey y_uw_z_d t_uw b_iy b_ay m_ay s_ay_d
l;57;what society deems reality;w_ah_t s_ah_s_ay_ah_t_iy d_iy_m_z r_iy_ae_l_ah_t_iy
l;58;never feels satisfactory;n_eh_v_er f_iy_l_z s_ae_t_ah_s_f_ae_k_t_er_iy
a;59;i think were meant for more than this;ay th_ih_ng_k w_iy_r m_eh_n_t f_ao_r m_ao_r dh_ae_n dh_ih_s
i;60;that desire (is) in our design;dh_ae_t d_ah_z_ay_r ih_z ih_n aw_r d_ah_z_ay_n
h;62;i won-t let go of all the dreams;ay w_ow_n_t l_eh_t g_ow ah_v ao_l dh_ah d_r_iy_m_z

f;70;somehow Ill let go of my mistakes;s_ah_m_hh_aw ay_l l_eh_t g_ow ah_v m_ay m_ih_s_t_ey_k_s
e;72;im tired of feeling abused;ay_m t_ay_r_d ah_v f_iy_l_ih_ng ah_b_y_uw_z_d
