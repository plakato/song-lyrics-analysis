f;30;i can taste the stale air on my tongue;ay k_ah_n t_ey_s_t dh_ah s_t_ey_l eh_r aa_n m_ay t_ah_ng
c;31;and death lights up the sky;ah_n_d d_eh_th l_ay_t_s ah_p dh_iy s_k_ay

a;36;how much longer will I embrace sorrow;hh_aw m_ah_ch l_ao_ng_g_er w_ah_l ay ih_m_b_r_ey_s s_aa_r_ow
c;38;from the moment that you entered my life;f_r_ah_m dh_ah m_ow_m_ah_n_t dh_ae_t y_uw eh_n_t_ax_d m_ay l_ay_f
