a;3;but now Im leaving to find me something new;b_ah_t n_aw ay_m l_iy_v_ih_ng t_uw f_ay_n_d m_iy s_ah_m_th_ih_ng n_y_uw
p;5;where was my common sense at;w_eh_r w_ah_z m_ay k_aa_m_ah_n s_eh_n_s ae_t
b;6;i always sensed that you were an angel God sent back;ay ao_l_w_ey_z s_eh_n_s_t dh_ae_t y_uw w_er ae_n ey_n_jh_ah_l g_aa_d s_eh_n_t b_ae_k

o;8;that likes to deceive and charm you;dh_ae_t l_ay_k_s t_uw d_ah_s_iy_v ah_n_d ch_aa_r_m y_uw
c;9;i should-ve went with my instincts;ay sh_uh_d_ah_v w_eh_n_t w_ih_dh m_ay ih_n_s_t_ih_ng_k_t_s
c;10;and knew that the ship wouldn-t stay afloat and that wed sink;ah_n_d n_uw dh_ae_t dh_ah sh_ih_p w_uh_d_ah_n_t s_t_ey ah_f_l_ow_t ah_n_d dh_ae_t w_iy_d s_ih_ng_k

e;12;especially when you struck with boredom;ah_s_p_eh_sh_l_iy w_eh_n y_uw s_t_r_ah_k w_ih_dh b_ao_r_d_ah_m
f;13;and you were far from a plain Jane you were amazing;ah_n_d y_uw w_er f_aa_r f_r_ah_m ah p_l_ey_n jh_ey_n y_uw w_er ah_m_ey_z_ih_ng
f;14;but your attitude was too far from saving;b_ah_t y_ao_r ae_t_ah_t_uw_d w_ah_z t_uw f_aa_r f_r_ah_m s_ey_v_ih_ng
f;15;and nothing was changing excuses and blaming;ah_n_d n_ah_th_ih_ng w_ah_z ch_ey_n_jh_ih_ng ih_k_s_k_y_uw_s_ih_z ah_n_d b_l_ey_m_ih_ng
c;16;you always promised me the same things;y_uw ao_l_w_ey_z p_r_aa_m_ah_s_t m_iy dh_ah s_ey_m th_ih_ng_z

g;19;how could you look so harmless;hh_aw k_uh_d y_uw l_uh_k s_ow hh_aa_r_m_l_ah_s

f;23;but no more frustrations ain-t no more waiting;b_ah_t n_ow m_ao_r f_r_ah_s_t_r_ey_sh_ah_n_z ey_n_t n_ow m_ao_r w_ey_t_ih_ng
f;24;im taking all my shit and vacating;ay_m t_ey_k_ih_ng ao_l m_ay sh_iy_t ah_n_d v_ey_k_ey_t_ih_ng

l;35;we used to kick it like homies I wish that I only;w_iy y_uw_z_d t_uw k_ih_k ih_t l_ay_k hh_aa_m_ah_er_s ay w_ih_sh dh_ae_t ay ow_n_l_iy
l;36;had known that youd turn out to be phony;hh_ae_d n_ow_n dh_ae_t y_uw_d t_er_n aw_t t_uw b_iy f_ow_n_iy
q;37;i can-t believe that you fooled me;ay k_ae_n_t b_ah_l_iy_v dh_ae_t y_uw f_uw_l_d m_iy
a;38;you truly did me like one of those chicks from those Godfather movies;y_uw t_r_uw_l_iy d_ih_d m_iy l_ay_k w_ah_n ah_v dh_ow_z ch_ih_k_s f_r_ah_m dh_ow_z g_aa_d_f_aa2_dh_er m_uw_v_iy_z
g;39;i didn-t think it was possible;ay d_ih_d_n_t th_ih_ng_k ih_t w_ah_z p_aa_s_ah_b_ah_l
g;40;but now looking back at how you acted it was nothing but comical;b_ah_t n_aw l_uh_k_ih_ng b_ae_k ae_t hh_aw y_uw ae_k_t_ah_d ih_t w_ah_z n_ah_th_ih_ng b_ah_t k_aa_m_ih_k_ah_l
c;41;i wish I would-ve saw it coming but I was caught up in;ay w_ih_sh ay w_uh_d_ah_v s_ao ah_t k_ah_m_ih_ng b_ah_t ay w_ah_z k_aa_t ah_p ih_n
m;42;thinking we had a bond or something;th_ih_ng_k_ah_ng w_iy hh_ae_d ah b_aa_n_d ao_r s_ah_m_th_ih_ng
b;43;i can-t believe that you did me like that;ay k_ae_n_t b_ah_l_iy_v dh_ae_t y_uw d_ih_d m_iy l_ay_k dh_ae_t
b;44;you sliced me in the kidney and knifed me in the back;y_uw s_l_ay_s_t m_iy ih_n dh_ah k_ih_d_n_iy ah_n_d n_ay_f_t m_iy ih_n dh_ah b_ae_k
g;45;i wished Id known from the start that if I gave you my heart;ay w_ih_sh_t ay_d n_ow_n f_r_ah_m dh_ah s_t_aa_r_t dh_ae_t ah_f ay g_ey_v y_uw m_ay hh_aa_r_t

m;49;i thought wed be together forever thanks for proving me wrong;ay th_ao_t w_iy_d b_iy t_ah_g_eh_dh_er f_er_eh_v_er th_ae_ng_k_s f_ao_r p_r_uw_v_ih_ng m_iy r_ao_ng
e;50;and to you I dedicate this song;ah_n_d t_uw y_uw ay d_eh_d_ah_k_ey_t dh_ih_s s_ao_ng
o;52;i hate that I wasted all of my time with you;ay hh_ey_t dh_ae_t ay w_ey_s_t_ah_d ao_l ah_v m_ay t_ay_m w_ih_dh y_uw

n;57;i swear to God I had it all planned out;ay s_w_eh_r t_uw g_aa_d ay hh_ae_d ih_t ao_l p_l_ae_n_d aw_t
n;58;young love had me standing on the corner with my dumb hands out;y_ah_ng l_ah_v hh_ae_d m_iy s_t_ae_n_d_ih_ng aa_n dh_ah k_ao_r_n_er w_ih_dh m_ay d_ah_m hh_ae_n_d_z aw_t
i;59;and Ill admit that I was blind and kind of anxious for the meaning;ah_n_d ay_l ah_d_m_ih_t dh_ae_t ay w_ah_z b_l_ay_n_d ah_n_d k_ay_n_d ah_v ae_ng_k_sh_ah_s f_ao_r dh_ah m_iy_n_ih_ng
i;60;and it broke my little heart when I discovered you were cheating;ah_n_d ih_t b_r_ow_k m_ay l_ih_t_ah_l hh_aa_r_t w_eh_n ay d_ih_s_k_ah_v_er_d y_uw w_er ch_iy_t_ih_ng
c;61;and you smiled the type of smile that cuts into the skin;ah_n_d y_uw s_m_ay_l_d dh_ah t_ay_p ah_v s_m_ay_l dh_ae_t k_ah_t_s ih_n_t_uw dh_ah s_k_ih_n
c;62;with those razorbladed lips blowing kisses to the wind;w_ih_dh dh_ow_z r_ey_z_er_ha_b_l_ey_d_ah_d l_ih_p_s b_l_ow_ih_ng k_ih_s_ah_z t_uw dh_ah w_ih_n_d
m;63;and I should-ve seen it then you were in it for the blood;ah_n_d ay sh_uh_d_ah_v s_iy_n ih_t dh_eh_n y_uw w_er ih_n ih_t f_ao_r dh_ah b_l_ah_d
m;64;and you never gave a minute into visualizing us;ah_n_d y_uw n_eh_v_er g_ey_v ah m_ih_n_ih_t ih_n_t_uw v_ih_zh_w_ah_l_ay2_z_ih_ng ah_s

c;67;with the whole world dead at my toes I grew bitter;w_ah_dh dh_ah hh_ow_l w_er_l_d d_eh_d ae_t m_ay t_ow_z ay g_r_uw b_ih_t_er
c;68;and if thats what you want I declare you the winner;ah_n_d ah_f dh_ae_t_s w_ah_t y_uw w_aa_n_t ay d_ih_k_l_eh_r y_uw dh_ah w_ih_n_er
f;69;move on and find a new host to claim;m_uw_v aa_n ah_n_d f_ay_n_d ah n_y_uw hh_ow_s_t t_uw k_l_ey_m
