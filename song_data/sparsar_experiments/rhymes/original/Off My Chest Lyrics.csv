h;43;because you built up this wall;b_ih_k_ao_z y_uw b_ih_l_t ah_p dh_ih_s w_ao_l
h;44;now you don-t have anyone you can ever call;n_aw y_uw d_ow_n_t hh_ae_v eh_n_iy_w_ah_n y_uw k_ah_n eh_v_er k_ao_l
u;45;because the refuse to let you take them down on your fall;b_ih_k_ao_z dh_ah r_ih_f_y_uw_z t_uw l_eh_t y_uw t_ey_k dh_eh_m d_aw_n aa_n y_ao_r f_aa_l
h;47;the fact that my sister doesn-t talk to me anymore;dh_ah f_ae_k_t dh_ae_t m_ay s_ih_s_t_er d_ah_z_n_t t_ao_k t_uw m_iy eh_n_iy_m_ao_r

w;49;she would rather talk to that bitch who hates me;sh_iy w_uh_d r_ae_dh_er t_ao_k t_uw dh_ae_t b_ih_ch hh_uw hh_ey_t_s m_iy
w;50;she had to make a choice and the choice wasn-t me;sh_iy hh_ae_d t_uw m_ey_k ah ch_oy_s ah_n_d dh_ah ch_oy_s w_oh_z_n_t m_iy
l;51;but the fact (is) (is) Id take a bullet to save that friend of her-s;b_ah_t dh_ah f_ae_k_t ih_z ih_z ay_d t_ey_k ah b_uh_l_ah_t t_uw s_ey_v dh_ae_t f_r_eh_n_d ah_v hh_er_z
l;52;because knowing that my sister was sad would be much worse;b_ih_k_ao_z n_ow_ih_ng dh_ae_t m_ay s_ih_s_t_er w_ah_z s_ae_d w_uh_d b_iy m_ah_ch w_er_s
l;53;than me taking the big one and laying in a hearse;dh_ae_n m_iy t_ey_k_ih_ng dh_ah b_ih_g w_ah_n ah_n_d l_ey_ih_ng ih_n ah hh_er_s
p;54;and Id die for anyone of my family members blood or not;ah_n_d ay_d d_ay f_ao_r eh_n_iy_w_ah_n ah_v m_ay f_ae_m_ax_l_ih m_eh_m_b_er_z b_l_ah_d ao_r n_ax_t
h;55;because I owe it to them through the wars that they fought;b_ih_k_ao_z ay ow ih_t t_uw dh_eh_m th_r_uw dh_ah w_ao_r_z dh_ae_t dh_ey f_ao_t
e;56;with me and by my side and I know I could-ve done better;w_ih_dh m_iy ah_n_d b_ay m_ay s_ay_d ah_n_d ay n_ow ay k_uh_d_ah_v d_ah_n b_eh_t_er
e;57;so thats why I had to sit down and write this letter;s_ow dh_ae_t_s w_ay ay hh_ae_d t_uw s_ih_t d_aw_n ah_n_d r_ay_t dh_ih_s l_eh_t_er

m;59;yell at myself and get it all out;y_eh_l ae_t m_ay_s_eh_l_f ah_n_d g_eh_t ih_t ao_l aw_t
m;60;these voices in my head have been getting too loud;dh_iy_z v_oy_s_ah_z ih_n m_ay hh_eh_d hh_ae_v b_ih_n g_eh_t_ih_ng t_uw l_aw_d
m;61;and I have to fix the problems with the people I can-t live without;ah_n_d ay hh_ae_v t_uw f_ih_k_s dh_ah p_r_aa_b_l_ah_m_z w_ih_dh dh_ah p_iy_p_ah_l ay k_ae_n_t l_ay_v w_ih_th_aw_t
