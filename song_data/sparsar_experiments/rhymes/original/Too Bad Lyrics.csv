a;0;i basically cheated life;ay b_ey_s_ih_k_l_iy ch_iy_t_ah_d l_ay_f
a;1;waited to see the light;w_ey_t_ah_d t_ah s_iy dh_iy l_ay_t
a;2;but decided to skip death cause I hated what he was like;b_ah_t d_ah_s_ay_d_ah_d t_ah s_k_ih_p d_eh_th k_aa_z ay hh_ey_t_ah_d hh_w_ah_t hh_iy w_ah_z l_ay_k
a;3;saw the cost of living and paid it the full price;s_ao dh_iy k_aa_s_t ah_v l_ih_v_ih_ng ah_n_d p_ey_d ah_t dh_iy f_uh_l p_r_ay_s
a;4;then I flew back round to earth and made it without a fight;dh_eh_n ay f_l_uw b_ae_k r_aw_n_d t_ah er_th ah_n_d m_ey_d ah_t w_ih_dh_aw_t ey f_ay_t
a;5;i remember when people thought I was crazy well they were right;ay r_ih_m_eh_m_b_ax w_eh_n p_iy_p_ah_l th_ao_t ay w_ah_z k_r_ey_z_iy w_eh_l dh_ey w_er r_ay_t
a;6;started gettin mad cause I hate when the bullies bite;s_t_aa_r_t_ah_d s_eh_t_iy_n m_ae_d k_aa_z ay hh_ey_t w_eh_n dh_ah b_uh_l_iy_z b_ay_t
a;7;in ISS for a day over blinking lights;ih_n  f_ao_r ah d_ey ow_v_er b_l_ih_ng_k_ih_ng l_ay_t_s
a;8;yelled at an administrator and I was like;y_eh_l_d ae_t ae_n ah_d_m_ih_n_ah_s_t_r_ey2_t_er ah_n_d ay w_ah_z l_ay_k
a;9;i hate it when people lie;ay hh_ey_t ah_t hh_w_ih_n p_iy_p_ah_l l_ay
a;10;almost went insane in a way and I caused a fright;ao_l_m_ow_s_t w_eh_n_t ih_n_s_ey_n ih_n ah w_ey ah_n_d ay k_aa_z_d ah f_r_ay_t
a;11;then in 7th grade I tried to be lazy with all my might;dh_eh_n ih_n  g_r_ey_d ay t_r_ay_d t_uw b_iy l_ey_z_iy w_ih_dh ao_l m_ay m_ay_t
a;12;but my grades were just getting nice;b_ah_t m_ay g_r_ey_d_z w_er jh_ah_s_t g_eh_t_ih_ng n_ay_s
a;13;and then my teachers though hey maybe this kid (is) bright;ah_n_d dh_eh_n m_ay t_iy_ch_er_z dh_ow hh_ey m_ey_b_iy dh_ih_s k_ih_d ih_z b_r_ay_t
a;14;maybe his mom was right;m_ey_b_iy hh_ih_z m_aa_m w_ah_z r_ay_t
a;15;maybe hes Woodlands type;m_ey_b_iy hh_iy_s w_uh_d_l_ae_n_d_z t_ay_p
a;16;and theres just nothing else to say that I wouldn-t mind;ah_n_d dh_eh_r_s jh_ah_s_t n_ah_th_ih_ng eh_l_s t_uw s_ey dh_ae_t ay w_uh_d_ah_n_t m_ay_n_d
a;17;cause thats just how its been to the day that I wrote this rhyme;k_aa_z dh_ae_t_s jh_ah_s_t hh_aw ih_t_s b_ih_n t_uw dh_ah d_ey dh_ae_t ay r_ow_t dh_ih_s r_ay_m
b;19;im tired of the world theres not enough air;ay_m t_ay_r_d ah_v dh_ah w_er_l_d dh_eh_r_s n_ax_t ah_n_ah_f eh_r
b;20;im tired of school I hate having to share;ay_m t_ay_r_d ah_v s_k_uw_l ay hh_ey_t hh_ae_v_ih_ng t_uw sh_eh_r
c;21;im tired of all these people talking bout swag;ay_m t_ay_r_d ah_v ao_l dh_iy_z p_iy_p_ah_l t_ao_k_ih_ng b_aw_t s_w_ae_g
c;22;so if youre tired of me thats just too bad;s_ow ah_f y_uw_r t_ay_r_d ah_v m_iy dh_ae_t_s jh_ah_s_t t_uw b_ae_d
d;24;im a little fool;ay_m ah l_ih_t_ah_l f_uw_l
d;25;only in middle school;ow_n_l_iy ih_n m_ih_d_ah_l s_k_uw_l
e;26;somehow Ive been deemed (as) a talented and gifted individual;s_ah_m_hh_aw ay_v b_ih_n d_iy_m_d ae_z ah t_ae_l_ah_n_t_ah_d ah_n_d g_ih_f_t_ah_d ih_n_d_ah_v_ih_jh_ah_w_ah_l
e;27;man I swear its a miracle;m_ae_n ay s_w_eh_r ih_t_s ey m_ih_r_ah_k_ah_l
f;28;how I handled the hate and the ridicule;hh_aw ay hh_ae_n_d_ah_l_d dh_ah hh_ey_t ah_n_d dh_ah r_ih_d_ah_k_y_uw_l
m;29;i couldn-t care less and I mean that literally;ay k_uh_d_n_t k_eh_r l_eh_s ah_n_d ay m_iy_n dh_ae_t l_ih_t_er_ah_l_iy
e;30;i hate to say this but its just pitiful;ay hh_ey_t t_uw s_ey dh_ih_s b_ah_t ih_t_s jh_ah_s_t p_ih_t_ah_f_ah_l
n;31;what our generation-s forced to listen to;w_ah_t aw_r jh_eh_n_er_ey_sh_ah_n_z f_ao_r_s_t t_uw l_ih_s_ah_n t_uw
e;32;if you can rhyme two words that means youre lyrical;ah_f y_uw k_ah_n r_ay_m t_uw w_er_d_z dh_ae_t m_iy_n_z y_uw_r l_ih_r_ih_k_ah_l
o;33;its hard to show y-all how I feel but here we go;ih_t_s hh_aa_r_d t_uw sh_ow y_ao_l hh_aw ay f_iy_l b_ah_t hh_ih_r w_iy g_ow
g;34;i don-t care how swag you got;ay d_ow_n_t k_eh_r hh_aw s_w_ae_g y_uw g_aa_t
g;35;how many money bags you rock;hh_aw m_eh_n_iy m_ah_n_iy b_ae_g_z y_uw r_aa_k
g;36;how many hags youve shot;hh_aw m_eh_n_iy hh_ae_g_z y_uw_v sh_aa_t
g;37;or how much crack or pot;ao_r hh_aw m_ah_ch k_r_ae_k ao_r p_aa_t
h;38;youve sold on the street;y_uw_v s_ow_l_d aa_n dh_ah s_t_r_iy_t
h;39;or whether your lungs bleed and I won-t speak;er w_eh_dh_er y_ao_r l_ah_ng_z b_l_iy_d ah_n_d ay w_ow_n_t s_p_iy_k
f;40;anymore on this before this whole song turns into a full on diss;eh_n_iy_m_ao_r aa_n dh_ih_s b_ah_f_ao_r dh_ih_s hh_ow_l s_ao_ng t_er_n_z ih_n_t_uw ah f_uh_l aa_n d_ih_s
i;41;so Ill just clench my fist and bite my tongue;s_ow ay_l jh_ah_s_t k_l_eh_n_ch m_ay f_ih_s_t ah_n_d b_ay_t m_ay t_ah_ng
l;42;whether Im right or wrong;w_eh_dh_er ay_m r_ay_t ao_r r_ao_ng
p;43;i know right where Im going;ay n_ow r_ay_t w_eh_r ay_m g_ow_ih_ng
l;44;i-mma keep writing this song;iy_ax_ k_iy_p r_ay_t_ih_ng dh_ih_s s_ao_ng
b;46;im here to murder rap with my futuristic weaponry;ay_m hh_ih_r t_uw m_er_d_er r_ae_p w_ih_dh m_ay f_y_uw_ch_er_ih_s_t_ih_k w_eh_p_ah_n_r_iy
m;47;and if I run out of ammo Ill take it out alphabetically;ah_n_d ah_f ay r_ah_n aw_t ah_v ae_m_ow ay_l t_ey_k ih_t aw_t ae_l_f_ah_b_eh_t_ih_k_l_iy
h;48;cause I want y-all to understand every sound every letter see;k_aa_z ay w_aa_n_t y_ao_l t_uw ah_n_d_er_s_t_ae_n_d eh_v_er_iy s_aw_n_d eh_v_er_iy l_eh_t_er s_iy
b;49;so I guess theres no wonder I spell my name phonetically;s_ow ay g_eh_s dh_eh_r_s n_ow w_ah_n_d_er ay s_p_eh_l m_ay n_ey_m f_ah_n_eh_t_ih_k_l_iy
m;50;and yeah there just so happens to be a small devil that rests in me;ah_n_d y_ae dh_eh_r jh_ah_s_t s_ow hh_ae_p_ah_n_z t_uw b_iy ah s_m_ao_l d_eh_v_ah_l dh_ae_t r_eh_s_t_s ih_n m_iy
h;51;and lately Ive been thinking that I might just let it free;ah_n_d l_ey_t_l_iy ay_v b_ih_n th_ih_ng_k_ah_ng dh_ae_t ay m_ay_t jh_ah_s_t l_eh_t ih_t f_r_iy
h;52;it tells me life-ll be better I say it better be;ih_t t_eh_l_z m_iy l_l_iy b_iy b_eh_t_er ay s_ey ih_t b_eh_t_er b_iy
m;53;people tell me Im smart I say no Im just clever me;p_iy_p_ah_l t_eh_l m_iy ay_m s_m_aa_r_t ay s_ey n_ow ay_m jh_ah_s_t k_l_eh_v_er m_iy
c;54;and I might wright a letter to the angles of rap;ah_n_d ay m_ay_t r_ay_t ah l_eh_t_er t_uw dh_ah ae_ng_g_ah_l_z ah_v r_ae_p
c;55;cause Im not afraid to admit that Im hating this crap;k_aa_z ay_m n_ax_t ah_f_r_ey_d t_uw ah_d_m_ih_t dh_ae_t ay_m hh_ey_t_ih_ng dh_ih_s k_r_ae_p
f;56;so many things I want to change I even got a list;s_ow m_eh_n_iy th_ih_ng_z ay w_aa_n_t t_uw ch_ey_n_jh ay iy_v_ah_n g_aa_t ah l_ih_s_t
f;57;so my letter would probably go something like this;s_ow m_ay l_eh_t_er w_uh_d p_r_aa_b_ah_b_l_iy g_ow s_ah_m_th_ih_ng l_ay_k dh_ih_s
b;58;dear angles up there;d_ih_r ae_ng_g_ah_l_z ah_p dh_eh_r
f;59;all I ask now (is) that you please come here;ao_l ay ae_s_k n_aw ih_z dh_ae_t y_uw p_l_iy_z k_ah_m hh_ih_r
b;60;because rap (is) headed straight down stairs;b_ih_k_ao_z r_ae_p ih_z hh_eh_d_ah_d s_t_r_ey_t d_aw_n s_t_eh_r_z
b;61;its turned to a bad show this generations in the front chair;ih_t_s t_er_n_d t_uw ah b_ae_d sh_ow dh_ih_s jh_eh_n_er_ey_sh_ah_n_z ih_n dh_ah f_r_ah_n_t ch_eh_r
q;62;so I just hope something good (is) calling the;s_ow ay jh_ah_s_t hh_ow_p s_ah_m_th_ih_ng g_uh_d ah_z k_ao_l_ih_ng dh_ah
i;63;game cause right now its coming apart like fallin dust;g_ey_m k_aa_z r_ay_t n_aw ih_t_s k_ah_m_ih_ng ah_p_aa_r_t l_ay_k f_ae_l_ih_n d_ah_s_t
i;64;so I just ask that you please help all of us;s_ow ay jh_ah_s_t ae_s_k dh_ae_t y_uw p_l_iy_z hh_eh_l_p ao_l ah_v ah_s
m;65;thank you sincerely Unonimus;th_ae_ng_k y_uw s_ih_n_s_ih_r_l_iy U_n_ao_n_iy_m_ax_s
