h;0;im from a place where doubt and hate were emotions;ay_m f_r_ah_m ah p_l_ey_s w_eh_r d_aw_t ah_n_d hh_ey_t w_er ih_m_ow_sh_n_z
h;1;and real rap was buried and wack music got promotions;ah_n_d r_iy_l r_ae_p w_ah_z b_eh_r_iy_d ah_n_d w_ae_k m_y_uw_z_ih_k g_aa_t p_r_ax_m_ow_sh_n_z
a;2;but I hustled hard and I stayed on the grind in hopes that one day I would;b_ah_t ay hh_ah_s_ah_l_d hh_aa_r_d ah_n_d ay s_t_ey_d aa_n dh_ah g_r_ay_n_d ih_n hh_ow_p_s dh_ae_t w_ah_n d_ey ay w_uh_d

b;6;i spat the truth into every cleverly worded line;ay s_p_ae_t dh_ah t_r_uw_th ih_n_t_uw eh_v_er_iy k_l_eh_v_er_l_iy w_er_d_ah_d l_ay_n

f;19;beautiful mixtapes;b_y_uw_t_ah_f_ah_l m_ih_k_s_t_ey_p_s
o;20;they are the foundation of my legacy to remain even after Im gone;dh_ey aa_r dh_ah f_aw_n_d_ey_sh_ah_n ah_v m_ay l_eh_g_ah_s_iy t_uw r_ih_m_ey_n iy_v_ah_n ae_f_t_er ay_m g_ao_n

l;23;im just trying to feed my family because for so long they provided for me;ay_m jh_ah_s_t t_r_ay_ih_ng t_uw f_iy_d m_ay f_ae_m_ax_l_ih b_ih_k_ao_z f_ao_r s_ow l_ao_ng dh_ey p_r_ah_v_ay_d_ah_d f_ao_r m_iy

b;25;because even if my style isn-t your favourite you can-t ignore the grind;b_ih_k_ao_z iy_v_ah_n ah_f m_ay s_t_ay_l ih_z_n_t y_ao_r f_ey_v_ax_r_ih_t y_uw k_ae_n_t ih_g_n_ao_r dh_ah g_r_ay_n_d

a;27;when people told me that I would never graduate when people told me I would;w_eh_n p_iy_p_ah_l t_ow_l_d m_iy dh_ae_t ay w_uh_d n_eh_v_er g_r_ae_jh_ua_t w_eh_n p_iy_p_ah_l t_ow_l_d m_iy ay w_uh_d
f;28;never rise above the hate;n_eh_v_er r_ay_z ah_b_ah_v dh_ah hh_ey_t
l;29;i told them that they need to wait for that one date where they look up at me;ay t_ow_l_d dh_eh_m dh_ae_t dh_ey n_iy_d t_uw w_ey_t f_ao_r dh_ae_t w_ah_n d_ey_t w_eh_r dh_ey l_uh_k ah_p ae_t m_iy
f;30;and see that I became great;ah_n_d s_iy dh_ae_t ay b_ih_k_ey_m g_r_ey_t

f;39;back when we freestyled to instrumentals we found on the internet;b_ae_k w_eh_n w_iy f_r_iy_s_t_ay_l_d t_uw ih_n_s_t_r_ah_m_eh_n_t_ah_l_z w_iy f_aw_n_d aa_n dh_ah ih_n_t_er_n_eh_t
