a;0;a few months back I went through a breakup;ey f_y_uw m_ah_n_th_s b_ae_k ay w_eh_n_t th_r_uw ey b_r_ey_k_ah_p
p;1;started dating this girl who gave it all up;s_t_aa_r_t_ah_d d_ey_t_ih_ng dh_ah_s g_er_l hh_uw g_ey_v ah_t ao_l ah_p
a;2;blonde haired dancer getting freaky on the first date;b_l_aa_n_d hh_eh_r_d d_ae_n_s_er g_ih_t_ih_ng f_r_iy_k_iy aa_n dh_iy f_er_s_t d_ey_t
a;3;but stole my heart straight out the gate;b_ah_t s_t_ow_l m_ay hh_aa_r_t s_t_r_ey_t aw_t dh_iy g_ey_t
b;4;this girl had it going for her;dh_ah_s g_er_l hh_ae_d ah_t g_ow_ah_n f_r_er hh_er
b;5;killer body and men begging for her;k_ih_l_er b_aa_d_iy ah_n_d m_eh_n b_eh_g_ih_ng f_r_er hh_er
q;6;and even when they offered more than me;ah_n_d iy_v_ah_n hh_w_ih_n dh_ey ao_f_er_d m_ao_r dh_ae_n m_iy
r;7;she said there was no other man for her;sh_iy s_eh_d dh_eh_r w_ah_z n_ow ah_dh_er m_ae_n f_ao_r hh_er
c;8;i had her down on both knees;ay hh_ae_d hh_er d_aw_n aa_n b_ow_th n_iy_z
c;9;i had her begging Baby please;ay hh_ae_d hh_er b_eh_g_ih_ng b_ey_b_iy p_l_iy_z
s;10;i gave her all my body had and in return;ay g_ey_v hh_er ao_l m_ay b_aa_d_iy hh_ae_d ah_n_d ih_n r_ih_t_er_n
c;11;she fulfilled my needs;sh_iy f_uh_l_f_ih_l_d m_ay n_iy_d_z
d;12;it was my fault she fell so hard;ih_t w_ah_z m_ay f_ao_l_t sh_iy f_eh_l s_ow hh_aa_r_d
d;13;i told her things to fill her heart;ay t_ow_l_d hh_er th_ih_ng_z t_uw f_ih_l hh_er hh_aa_r_t
e;14;but when it came down to it I wanted that ass;b_ah_t w_eh_n ih_t k_ey_m d_aw_n t_uw ih_t ay w_oh_n_t_ih_d dh_ae_t ae_s
e;15;so Id do anything to make it last;s_ow ay_d d_uw eh_n_iy_th_ih_ng t_ah m_ey_k ah_t l_ae_s
f;16;i held on by doing all the romantic things;ay hh_eh_l_d aa_n b_ay d_uw_ih_ng ao_l dh_iy r_ow_m_ae_n_t_ih_k th_ih_ng_z
g;17;she wanted something I bought her everything;sh_iy w_ao_n_ah_d s_ah_m_th_ih_ng ay b_aa_t hh_er eh_v_r_iy_th_ih_ng
h;18;but at the end of the night one thing on my mind;b_ah_t ae_t dh_iy eh_n_d ah_v dh_iy n_ay_t hh_w_ah_n th_ih_ng aa_n m_ay m_ay_n_d
h;19;and I know it was wrong but I did it every time;ah_n_d ay n_ow ah_t w_ah_z r_ao_ng b_ah_t ay d_ah_d ah_t eh_v_r_iy t_ay_m
f;20;she became suspicious when her mother walked in;sh_iy b_iy_k_ey_m s_ah_s_p_ih_sh_ah_s hh_w_ih_n hh_er m_ah_dh_er w_ao_k_t ih_n_ch
t;21;mad at all the places Id been;m_ae_d ae_t ao_l dh_ah p_l_ey_s_ah_z ay_d b_ah_n
e;22;i can still remember that beautiful smile she had;ay k_ae_n s_t_ih_l r_iy_m_eh_m_b_er dh_ah_t b_y_uw_t_ah_f_ah_l s_m_ay_l sh_iy hh_ae_d
f;23;when she saw my reassuring grin;hh_w_ih_n sh_iy s_ao m_ay r_iy_ah_sh_uh_r_ih_ng g_r_ih_n
i;24;but after a few months she cut me loose;b_ah_t ae_f_t_er ey f_y_uw m_ah_n_th_s sh_iy k_ah_t m_iy l_uw_s
i;25;used some words I probably shouldn-t have used;y_uw_z_d s_ah_m w_er_d_z ay p_r_aa_b_l_iy sh_uh_d_ah_n_t hh_ae_v y_uw_z_d
r;26;but after a while I began to miss her;b_ah_t ae_f_t_er ah w_ay_l ay b_ih_g_ae_n t_uw m_ih_s hh_er
i;27;thought I could win her back with the truth;th_ao_t ay k_uh_d w_ih_n hh_er b_ae_k w_ih_dh dh_ah t_r_uw_th
l;28;but it was too late and she was gone;b_ah_t ih_t w_ah_z t_uw l_ey_t ah_n_d sh_iy w_ah_z g_ao_n
t;29;its been too long she-s already moved on;ih_t_s b_ih_n t_uw l_ao_ng s_hh_iy_z ao_l_r_eh_d_iy m_uw_v_d aa_n
