d;63;elaine wasn-t interested in the same things;ah_l_ey_n w_oh_z_n_t ih_n_t_r_ax_s_t_ih_d ih_n dh_ah s_ey_m th_ih_ng_z
a;64;she felt she was living too plain;sh_iy f_eh_l_t sh_iy w_ah_z l_ih_v_ih_ng t_uw p_l_ey_n
b;65;and that she didn-t fit in so she started running with a gang;ah_n_d dh_ae_t sh_iy d_ih_d_n_t f_ih_t ih_n s_ow sh_iy s_t_aa_r_t_ah_d r_ah_n_ih_ng w_ih_dh ah g_ae_ng

d;70;soon she slowly lost her grip;s_uw_n sh_iy s_l_ow_l_iy l_ao_s_t hh_er g_r_ih_p
d;71;elaine started skipping classes and her grades started to slip;ah_l_ey_n s_t_aa_r_t_ah_d s_k_ih_p_ih_ng k_l_ae_s_ah_z ah_n_d hh_er g_r_ey_d_z s_t_aa_r_t_ah_d t_uw s_l_ih_p
