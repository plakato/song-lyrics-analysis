d;16;we were gone but what was on the top of the mountain;w_iy w_er g_ao_n b_ah_t w_ah_t w_ah_z aa_n dh_ah t_aa_p ah_v dh_ah m_aw_n_t_ah_n
g;6;from the fire;f_er_m dh_iy f_ay_er
a;1;but the moment we had I felt bad;b_ah_t dh_iy m_ow_m_ah_n_t w_iy hh_ae_d ay f_eh_l_t b_ae_d
i;14;undid our footprints even furled our flag and;ah_n_d_ih_d aw_r f_uh_t_p_r_ih_n_t_s iy_v_ah_n f_er_l_er_d aw_r f_l_ae_g ah_n_d
f;5;there was heat;dh_eh_r w_ah_z hh_iy_t
b;12;and it lunged for our throats;ah_n_d ih_t l_ah_n_jh_d f_ao_r aw_r th_r_ow_t_s
d;20;so we would make it down with no claim on Ghost Mountain;s_ow w_iy w_uh_d m_ey_k ih_t d_aw_n w_ih_dh n_ow k_l_ey_m aa_n g_ow_s_t m_aw_n_t_ah_n
b;7;but I still froze when I saw the ghost;b_ah_t ay s_t_ih_l f_r_ow_z hh_w_ih_n ay s_ao dh_iy g_ow_s_t
e;3;and then someone told a story about something dead and gory;ah_n_d dh_eh_n s_ah_m_w_ah_n t_ow_l_d ey s_t_ao_r_iy ah_b_aw_t s_ah_m_th_ih_ng d_eh_d ah_n_d g_ao_r_iy
c;9;i told the gang we weren-t welcome;ay t_ow_l_d dh_iy g_ae_ng w_iy w_er_n_t w_eh_l_k_ah_m
l;17;the mountain top;dh_ah m_aw_n_t_ah_n t_aa_p
c;11;so we stepped back but it was drawing near;s_ow w_iy s_t_eh_p_t b_ae_k b_ah_t ih_t w_ah_z d_r_ao_ih_ng n_ih_r
a;13;so we packed our things made tracks;s_ow w_iy p_ae_k_t aw_r th_ih_ng_z m_ey_d t_r_ae_k_s
a;0;when we climbed to the peak we planted a flag;hh_w_ih_n w_iy k_l_ay_m_d t_ah dh_iy p_iy_k w_iy p_l_ae_n_ah_d ey f_l_ae_g
h;10;the ghost made that clear;dh_ah g_ow_s_t m_ey_d dh_ae_t k_l_ih_r
a;2;and then night came so we got into our sleeping bags;ah_n_d dh_eh_n n_ay_t k_ey_m s_ow w_iy g_aa_t ih_n_t_ah aa_r s_l_iy_p_ih_ng b_ae_g_z
e;19;sweet nothing I made it up;s_w_iy_t n_ah_th_ih_ng ay m_ey_d ih_t ah_p
