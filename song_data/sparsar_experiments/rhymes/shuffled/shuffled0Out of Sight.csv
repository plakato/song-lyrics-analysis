a;0;i thought I heard your voice amid the noise on the street;ay th_ao_t ay hh_er_d y_ao_r v_oy_s ah_m_ih_d dh_ah n_oy_z aa_n dh_ah s_t_r_iy_t

a;1;i imagined it at best but the knot in my chest still skipped a beat;ay ih_m_ae_jh_ah_n_d ih_t ae_t b_eh_s_t b_ah_t dh_ah n_aa_t ih_n m_ay ch_eh_s_t s_t_ih_l s_k_ih_p_t ah b_iy_t
