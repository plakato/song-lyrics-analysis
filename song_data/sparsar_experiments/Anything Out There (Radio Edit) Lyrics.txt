Anything Out There (Radio Edit) Lyrics
by Vivian Green.

Yeah baby.
You know you got it.
Oh baby baby.
You know I like it.
Just how you do it.

You got some kind of nerve.
Ooh you're putting in all that work.
How you gon' do me like that?
Who told you to use me like that?
Where did you come from, out the blue?
I wasn't even expecting you.
But you got me coming right back.
Cause baby I need it like that.
I can't see nobody else.
Just you and me all by ourselves.
And now that it's all said and done.
I know that I got number one.

And baby it's your love.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.
And baby it's your touch.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.
Anything out there,.
Anything out there,.
Anything out there,.
And baby it's your love.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.

Ooh baby you go hard.
You sure know how raise the bar.
You're showing me all I deserve.
You're bringing me heaven on earth.
I'm giving you five stars for just being who you are.
So there ain't no need to rehearse.
Let's get straight to work.
I don't want nobody else.
Just you and me all by ourselves.
And now that it's all said and done.
I found number one.

And baby it's your love.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.
And baby it's your touch.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.
Anything out there,.
Anything out there,.
Anything out there,.
And baby it's your love.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.

Every time baby we make love.
You pull me in deeper.
I'll never get enough.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer, it's greater.
Can't nobody compare to you.
You make me a believer.
Keep doing what you do.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer, it's greater.

And baby it's your love.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.
And baby it's your touch.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.
Anything out there,.
Anything out there,.
Anything out there,.
And baby it's your love.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.

Anything out there,.
Anything out there,.
Anything out there,.

And baby it's your love.
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer.
It's greater than anything out.
