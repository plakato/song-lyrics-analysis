I Rather Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


You rather chase them bitches, I rather chase that money.
You niggas ain't a hundred.
See I rather knock her down, you trying to lock her down.
You niggas is some clowns.
See you niggas buying friends, I rather buy a Benz.
M.O.E. 'til the end.
And I'm never going broke, I rather sell dope.
You niggas is a joke.

You rather chase them hoes, I rather chase that fetti.
I think I'm Trey Songz, tell them niggas that we ready.
Fogging up the chevy, got a pack and a 4 liter.
Smoking loud, your Ls silent like tortilla.
Massina – I got a singer on my wrist.
Diamonds dancing straight retarded, bitch my ice jj fish.
‘member I was on my dick now I'm on my dick.
Like a fat person who can't leave the bed, I'm on my shit – shit!
Shawty mesmerized off my neck and wrist.
She feeling the kicks like a pregnant bitch.
Man this shit so effortless, I ain't even trying.
Shawty say she celibate, I ain't even buying.
I ain't even lying when I say I'm never stressing.
Ain't no thang but a chicken wing – get me some ranch dressing.
Count this money, count my blessings, but I can't count on you niggas.
These hoes gon' think I'm Gina if my head get any bigger.

These other rappers fake, I rather bump that Pac.
I rather bump that Pac.
See you never touched a block, you rather punch a clock.
I rather bust a Glock – gunshots.
Bitch this ain't no boy meets girl.
We just living by the principle like Boy Meets World.
What's a nut to a squirrel? Even less to an elephant.
Heard Lewinsky your girl, she be blowing your presidents.

Been fucking her ever since, that pussy get wet as shit.
And Pardon my manners, bitch I ride with that hammer.
Like a scene out of Belly, give a snitch a banana – bananas!
Yeah I know she fine but do that bitch swallow?
She asked me what's my sign, I told that bitch dollar.
Bitch holla when you talking bout some guap.
She got a nice bottom but I rather get the top - thot.
