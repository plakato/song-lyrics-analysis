Last Goodbye Lyrics
by Union J.

You never wanted to believe.
That we'd ever disagree beneath the dream.
Now it's cold as ever.
I always wanted to deny.
But the ocean makes the sky like you and I.
It's been that way forever.
Yeah, we always hurt the ones we love.
We hurt the ones we love, we love, we love.
But it doesn't mean that you and I should be alone tonight.
Should be alone tonight, tonight, tonight.
Save the last goodbye for me.
One more shiny memory.
Always remember.
I'll leave the light on for you, for you, for you.
Save the last goodbye for me.
Wake me up before you leave.
Always remember.
I'll leave the light on for you, for you, for you, for you.
We burn so bright before the fall.
Engines slowing to a crawl.
We had it all.
So why are we waiting?
Cause even though it's hard to hold.
No, we just can't let it go.
Away, so stay.
Keep this light from fading.
Yeah, we always hurt the ones we love.
We hurt the ones we love, we love, we love.
But it doesn't mean that you and I should be alone tonight.
Should be alone tonight, tonight, tonight.
Save the last goodbye for me.
One more shiny memory.
Always remember.
I'll leave the light on for you, for you.
Save the last goodbye for me.
Wake me up before you leave.
Always remember.
I'll leave the light on for you, for you.
Save the last goodbye.
Save the last goodbye.
Save the last goodbye.
The last goodbye, the last goodbye.
You and I can make it through tonight.
Make it through tonight, tonight, tonight.
Save the last goodbye for me.
Wake me up before you leave.
Always remember.
I'll leave the light on for you, for you, for you.
You and I can make it through tonight.
Make it through tonight, tonight, tonight.
