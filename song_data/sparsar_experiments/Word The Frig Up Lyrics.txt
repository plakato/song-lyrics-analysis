Word The Frig Up Lyrics
by Wordburglar.

Word the frig up!

Q-Bert?
I do work, no suit or tie â€“ you're not from New York, you work a New York.
Fries.
Shoo horseflies, I couldn't give two sharts like a food cart in a nude bar.
boudoir.
Or divorcing Sue Storm cause you're nothing to me, I'm putting balls in your.
stomach like some bubbly tea.
WB with the heat, stay in short sleeves, bring a lot to the plate like I'm.
David Ortiz.
Taking morphine since the age of fourteen been saying raps that make you say.
keep saying more please!
Sure thing! Just stick this in your boombox and get what you want, let grandma.
buy the tube socks.
You dudes rock! Yeah cause me and the Beatmason be the ************* ****.
like ******* bleeped sayings.

Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
When you're chugging from a chalice or a mug or a teacup.
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
Pissing in the wind or in your house with the seat up.
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
Playing this in your car like you got the CD stuck.
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!

Yeah we're having fun and if you're not well I'm sad to say - make like a leaf.
and leave like Kaberla.
Or pass the Cabernet, and you'll be glad to stay - opposite of working retail.
on a Saturday.
Something I've done but don't care to do, like sleeping in a bus stop in.
Riviere Du Loup.
But once you choose this as your stereo's selection it's a win-win like the.
Ontario election.
Yes my friend he's a special specimen, separate from the sediment reppin' a.
fresh regimen.
Lyrical dope yo - the best medicine - making heads spin more than breakers on.
ephederine.
Where the heck ya been? from the dot to Purcell's Cove let 'em know who.
makes it hotter than a burgled stove.
Flipping bars like the Hulk on a pub crawl It's Wordburglar! that's what the.
Frig's up y'all!

Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
When you're chugging from a chalice or a mug or a teacup.
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
Pissing in the wind or in your house with the seat up.
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
Blasting from your phone or some kind of delivery truck.
Word the frig up!
Word the frig up!
