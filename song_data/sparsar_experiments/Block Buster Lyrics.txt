Block Buster Lyrics
by Sweet.

Chinn/Chapman.

Aah, aah.
You better beware, you better take care.
You better watch out if you've got long black hair.
He'll come from behind, you go out of your mind.
You'd better not go, you'd never know what you'll find.

Aah, aah.
You look in his eyes, don't be surprised.
If you don't know what's going on behind his disguise.
Nobody knows where Buster goes.
He'll steal your woman out from under your nose.

Does anyone know the way, did we hear someone say.
We just haven't got a clue what to do.
Does anyone know the way, there's got to be a way.
To Block Buster!

The cops are out, they're running about.
Don't know if they'll ever be able to Block Buster out.
He's gotta be cought, he's gotta be taught.
Cause he's more evil than anyone here ever thought.

Does anyone know the way did we hear someone say.
We just haven't got a clue - ow!
Does anyone know the way, there's got to be a way.
To Block Buster!

Does anyone know the way did we hear someone say.
We just haven't got a clue what to do.
Does anyone know the way, there's got to be a way.
To Block Buster!

Aah, aah, aah, aah.
Buster, Buster, to Block Buster!
Buster, Buster, to Block Buster!
Buster, Buster, to Block Buster!....
