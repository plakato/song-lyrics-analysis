Cinnamon Lyrics
by ZOOpfish.


Maybe it's just in my mind yeah.
Maybe it's just in my mind.
Or maybe it's mine.

pfish.
Carry Underwood? I Drop over metal.
Hit a slow song, no cheating, just settle.

I knows, nose, nose you let go.
Proceed to give you what you paid for.
Shit's free so no less but way more.
Stay sore, and play more the day yours.
Pick you up around late, 8 let's say 4.
Table for 2, and please stay for dinner.
Origami napkin folded in the center.
She wakes up cold like the end of September.
Warm her up get high, she rehearsing for a tenner.
Tra la, la la la, la la la, la la.
Made her say ah, maybe just because.
Singing started from the bottom now she riding on top.

Drake Excerpt.
Started from the bottom now we here.

pfish.
Yeah she riding on top.
Know I'm on a roll so she stop then drop.
Things getting so hot.
Cause I hit it in the C like Sammy Sosa.
Kinda funny I just turned twenty.
And a teeny bit of me don't need no money.
Rather learn bout mummies, eat worms that gummy.
Slurps of honey for my nervous tummy.
Still getting richer no dummy.
When I get it I don't wanna share like Sonny.
Sunny, honey listen to your mommy.
Be a good chap but to don't get to chummy.
Chim chimney.
Pop in like like Mary Poppins with my grin glistening.
Damn I'm so fly.
You love me and I know why.
I'm Bueller, bit less cooler.
Reaching in the cooler while I'm skipping school uhh.
Looking for a chick with some hips that can hoolah.

And we can dispute over Rasputin.
Maybe rush you to Russia to ask Putin.
While you still got boots on.
Baby lets trip, you can go and get your shrooms on.
Don't talk about work lets talk about earth.
No walk around words, baby use verbs.
First, how bout a synonym.
I like you cause your sweet like cinnamon.
Like cinnamon.
Like cinnamon.
Like sin im in.
Likes and im in.

Maybe it's just in my minddd.
Or maybe it's mine.
