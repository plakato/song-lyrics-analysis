Moldy Flows Lyrics
by Rus.

Once again, it's the same shit, just a different day.
This paper and pen, nice grip, never slippin' away.

I'm awaiting the day where rap can boomerang back.
Cus if real recognize real, then few can say that.

Back to to the track, so I'm asking myself questions.
Trying to find the answers it's feelin' like I'm questin'.

My sound traveling large from Azeroth to Kalimdor.
I'll be waiting for every Friday on the calender.

Why? I guess it's just the day I'm most free.
Kick back with some finess and a couple of oldies.

Chill with homies, dirty flows like it's moldy.
So please, I only want people listenin' closely.

Better hold me back, I'm sinking inside the track.
Immersed within snares and claps, damn I love boom bap.

If I said that I don't, then your catching me lying.
If im not doing work, then what the fuck is grinding.

Sheesh, understand I'm just one man.
I got one plan, I got no crew no clan.

Every thing I do, everything that I see.
It's just the foundation of everything I want to be.

But that's stuck in my sleep, but I'm going for releasing it.
Life gets better when you add a little kief in it.

Hope that works for sounds too, not like I would mind.
When I write, I feel like I'm up high, 'cus of fast time.

I got bars like I was just macking inside of finland.
Shining over here like my teeth with silver fillins'.

And I'm stealing your ears, you feelin' it ya hear.
'Cus I'm making noise like my grinding's near.

It the end of the day, so when night comes up.
The beat gets pressed play, and you already know whats up.
