X-Man Lyrics
by Xeezy.

I am what I am &amp; nothing else.
I'm always in the center,that's why they call me X.
I'm like a treasure chest,I'm on a treasure quest.
I'll never take a break,I ain't affected by reccess_sion.
I won't be finished until I think I'm done.
I said I'll never quit,it's as if I was the bosses' son.
Pirate of the Caribbean,but I'm no Jack Sparrow.
I'm not Johnny Depp,I Won't thief yuh head like sleepy hollow.
&amp; After joy come sorrow,then what's before sadness.
You think your life's a living hell,well mines a dying madness.
My days are hella tragic.
I used to have the Magic.
But somehow I lost it,am I related to Alice....
In wonderland,I'm wondering what happens when I'm pondering.
Damn,it seems I lost my Jones like Sunderland.
Now I'm stoked,my life's become a joke.
Except I'm the only one that's laughing.
From this dream that I've awoke.
If I'm an X-man I can't be touched I guess I'm Rouge.
Life's a Mortal Kombat,now watch as mine goes up in smoke.
See I'm becoming know,I've also been forgotten.
But it don't bother me nun,you ni99a's softer than the cotton....
Picked by your ancestors.
I said I can't be touched kid,are you a child molester?
I bald like Uncle Fester....
I'm tryna be a real nigga &amp; sadly if I'm the realest then.
Nun from the truth can be further.
I look just like my further,which is odd cause I never met him.
I guess he made an Aquarius who's only life leasson....
He taught was to sink or swim.
Left me and mom's out on a limb.
But when times got hot,we were Miami,all we do is win.
I was a Tiny Tim,I used to be a scrooge.
Now in my money I swim,yeah you can me Scrooge.
Mc duck....
With me I wouldn't push yuh luck. ..
I'll having u shitting yourself like pampers,when you see my team pull up.
Pampers.....
Pull Up.....
You ni99as slow O what?
With me it's best you keep yuh thighs open.
&amp; keep yuh eyes shut.
I'm Trini Swaggerz no matter what....
I ride for Killa product.
Tions I'm on one . . .cah forget Mr Mission.
Can't forget about Yung Resse.
Can't forget my sister Ricee'.
Can't forget about Theo, Miller 9,nor Delly D.
Shout out to the Swagg unit,yeah them ni99as #doit.
Can't forget Kareem barca or Kareem Garcia.
Shout out to Dos Krizzy,Chantel,Kammy and Marina.
They never fell asleep on this dreamer.
Shout out my Trini Swaggerz team,pretty much run by the leader.
&amp; Clive don't think I don't see yuh,Lucas or Kern either.
&amp; Smartyguy even doh you light-skin,I'd still call you ma ni99a.
Go figure,this nigger,could figure.
How to get good figures.
Without being a gym member.
Remember my ni99a Joshua....
'Bake and cheese' no pasta....
I'm tryna keep back my laughter.
Ah fuck it my ni99a yeah HA! HA!
It's hard to crack a smile.
When you're a crocodile.
I'm LacOSTe in the world,&amp; might end up a purse,if I showed my soft side.
My soft hide,you soft hide.
These ni99as want for naught,so I guess they talking out they south.
side.
I don't keep my head up,I keep it looking down,like the lord do.
I swear to god I couldn't be anyone but me even if I want to.
I've lost a couple fiends,wish that I could make amends.
Tree's flirt with you then branch off &amp; leaves when the breeze make em.
bend.
Comprehend....
