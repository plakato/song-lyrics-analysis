Above and Below - The Bravery Unknown Remix Lyrics
by Unknown.

I bring you that food for the soul, 
No machine flow 
Vibrating with the best tones going through your headphones 
Mind opener out the known preachers, 
Lyrical teachings that is fucking. The genius 
Consciousness expanding like cancer 
Spreading everywhere truth over propaganda 
I'll. Let you know that you are the choice: 
And everything I spit. I start provoking 
 
Truth in the spit, 
Anything opposite 
Wouldn't be legit or worth shit, 
You be holding secrets of the cosmos when I flow 
Not that bullshit balto 
When half the party's at a condo 
I, don't sell dreams to the children for some millions. 
Promotin' killings, like the benefits to be a villain, 
Show, a social rebuildin', 
Teach them how to unify 
Focus on the real enemy 
While, seeing through the lies, 
 
I beautify the struggle with neurological signals 

It's like it's a part of me 
DNA and chromie 
Genetically in working Through the smoke in the pulley 
Going north, with the cause in the mentally distraught, 
Lessons taught always satisfy into the hungry thought. 
And I provide infinite sustenance. 
Knowledge is the key to any lock that you might have trouble with 
 
I bring you that food for the soul, 
No machine flow 
Vibrating with the best tones going through your headphones 
Mind opener out the known preachers, 
Lyrical teachings that is fucking. The genius 
Consciousness expanding like cancer 
Spreading everywhere truth over propaganda 
I'll. Let you know that you are the choice, 
And everything I spit. I start provoking 
 
When. I dream. I swim in another realm 
Livin', a life parallel to my real self 
Conversatin', with the stars through June to fall holograms 
Buildin' with the interstella' beings that are not of man 
Then, I wake up to reality. Roadside of the galaxy 
Where everything you thought was real is actually a fallacy. 
Very deceptive, but I'm now perceptive 
This smoke screen rented time a warm glow, effective 
Strengthened in the mind, 
A beat battle. 
Prob. ‘cause. He spooky like the catacombs at the bottom of the batter whore 
5 percent somethin', that disturbed your groove 
At any point in time. 
It'S ‘cause. I felt that you had to know. 
It was never disrespect 
No despite 
I, just like the bring you to the light when the time is right, 
Enlighten in the mind, but tighten in the rhymes 
Many suns feel upon dawn. If you ever find the time, 
 
I bring you that food for the soul, 
No machine flow 
Vibrating with the best tones going through your headphones 
Mind opener out the known preachers, 
Lyrical teachings that is fucking. The genius 
Consciousness expanding like cancer 
Spreading everywhere truth over propaganda. 
I'Ll, let you know that you are the choice, 
And everything I spit. I start provoking 
 
Morals of the stories. 
You will never get em' 
If. You didn't understand when I first said em' 
Maybe only my comprehension can understand 
The, true content of a multichoice sentence. 
Ying yang mental 
Duality imbalance, 
That type of thought, patent overcomes any challenge: 
And we'll never die 
And. A G transforms 
So, expect the next life to be way out of the norm. 
 
We're connected with eternal 
Never; second guessin'. It 
I'm always protectin' this with defined messages. 
Nevertheless contest the stress 
With, the best frustrations I get off my chest. 
Pressure damn sure makes diamonds 
In this case, replace it with impeccable rhymin', 
But still shinin' 
‘Cause, I drop jewels. 
I refuse to let the people be fuel, 
These, ignorant fools 
 
I bring you that food for the soul, 
No machine flow 
Vibrating with the best tones going through your headphones 
Mind opener out the known preachers, 
Lyrical teachings that is fucking. The genius 
Consciousness expanding like cancer 
Spreading everywhere truth over propaganda 
I'll. Let you know that you are the choice, 
And everything I spit. I start provoking
