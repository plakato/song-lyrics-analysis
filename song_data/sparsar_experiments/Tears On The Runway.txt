Tears On The Runway
by Tyler Carter.


Humble as she was I know she'd seen some better days.
And I bet in a way she probably feels so afraid.
Wouldn't hesitate to tell me that I'm fake.
But I guess I couldn't blame her.
She said I'm just another beauty queen.
And I know that it seems.
Like I'mma put out for every fucking dude in town.
I want to apologize for every man.
And I wanna kiss your scars, pretend they never happened.

You will escape the tears on the runway.
I won't let you down.

He won't let me down.
He said to have faith.
Could've read it off the page.
You're a gentleman cause that's what all the gentlemen say.
I bet you talked to me cause you saw my personality.
From across the hall, yeah.
Does it look like I believe that it must've been.
My heart of gold you saw.
Could've spared me all the lines.
Could've just said hi.

You know I want you but I, I wanna trust you but I.
You won't take no for an answer.
It's been weighing on my mind.
Just wanna do this right.
