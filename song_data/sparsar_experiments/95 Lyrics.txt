95 Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Tan legs sticking to the seat, the AC's broken broken 
Dash too hot for your feet and girl. It'S smoking, smoking, 
Heat wave's, here to stay here, baby, it's heavy heavy, 
, Gon na melt us both away. If we let it let it 
 
Ooh, it's ninety-five 
Ooh that mercury's rising 
, 
Black top so hot you can fry an egg 
Got. Your two piece underneath, let's head 
Out to the lake, cause we're jumping in yeah, we're jumping in 
You and me we're gon na beat this weather 
Get a little cooler, get a little wetter 
A little chill kick it back. Unwind 
Let's put this day on ice. It'S ninety-five, 
 
Got, a rope tied off to a limb that needs a little swinging swinging. 
Got, a cooler filled up to the brim that needs a little drinking drinking 
 
Ooh, it's ninety-five 
Ooh, it's summertime, 
, 
Black top. So hot you can fry an egg 
Got. Your two piece underneath, let's head 
Out to the lake, cause we're jumping in yeah, we're jumping in 
You and me we're gon na beat this weather 
Get a little cooler, get a little wetter 
A little chill kick it back. Unwind 
Let's put this day on ice. It'S ninety-five 
 
Ooh, it's ninety-five 
Ooh that mercury's rising 
Ooh, it's ninety-five, 
Ooh, it's summertime, 
, 
Black top! So hot you can fry an egg 
Got. Your two piece underneath, let's head 
Out to the lake, cause we're jumping in yeah, we're jumping in 
You and me we're gon na beat this weather 
Get a little cooler, get a little wetter 
A little chill kick it back. Unwind 
Let's put this day on ice. It'S ninety-five
