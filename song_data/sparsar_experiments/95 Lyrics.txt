95 Lyrics
by Swon Brothers.

Tan legs sticking to the seat, the AC's broken, broken.
Dash too hot for your feet and girl it's smoking, smoking.
Heat wave's here to stay here baby, it's heavy, heavy.
Gonna melt us both away if we let it, let it.

Ooh, it's ninety-five.
Ooh, that mercury's rising.

Black top so hot you can fry an egg.
Got your two piece underneath, let's head.
Out to the lake cause we're jumping in, yeah we're jumping in.
You and me, we're gonna beat this weather.
Get a little cooler, get a little wetter.
A little chill, kick it back, unwind.
Let's put this day on ice, it's ninety-five.

Got a rope tied off to a limb that needs a little swinging, swinging.
Got a cooler filled up to the brim that needs a little drinking, drinking.

Ooh, it's ninety-five.
Ooh, it's summertime.

Black top so hot you can fry an egg.
Got your two piece underneath, let's head.
Out to the lake cause we're jumping in, yeah we're jumping in.
You and me, we're gonna beat this weather.
Get a little cooler, get a little wetter.
A little chill, kick it back, unwind.
Let's put this day on ice, it's ninety-five.

Ooh, it's ninety-five.
Ooh, that mercury's rising.
Ooh, it's ninety-five.
Ooh, it's summertime.

Black top so hot you can fry an egg.
Got your two piece underneath, let's head.
Out to the lake cause we're jumping in, yeah we're jumping in.
You and me, we're gonna beat this weather.
Get a little cooler, get a little wetter.
A little chill, kick it back, unwind.
Let's put this day on ice, it's ninety-five.
