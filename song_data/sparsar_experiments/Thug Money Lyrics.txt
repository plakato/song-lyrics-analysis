Thug Money Lyrics

**.

Mobb life mutha fucka!

Eh man is this that Blunt Funk?

Yeah.

I hits the block walk wit a Tech.
A zip in my pocket.
350 rocket to get up out of the cases.
Move, get away cleanest if the po-po's try to beat us.
For the funk won't leave you breathin'.
I've been married since a fetus.
3 Tia fo Lia!
The 100 blocks got it sewed.
Put your lips in my business and get them mutha fuckas mowed.
My game is to be sold.
No suckas when I roll.
You comin' at me crazy juss to get yo lips swole like pop gum.
Givin' up lumps and bumps so I'm non-stop.
When I dumpin' hot ones out the drop.
Pull around and get you mopped.
Put the Mobb against a series of haters.
Tied up in a knot wit instigators.
Start speakin' fo playas.
I got my front porch sewed up.
The feds chasin'.
Through the back roots, cuts an stretch.
I got no time for no patience.
Keek hittin' fences.
A-G bailin' through the trees.
I was keyed.
So it's basic that you make it on your tee's nigga!
Uh.

The Thug Money.
The drug money.
The mud money, bet yo blood, and it's stuff under the rug money.

Smokin' some of that green dope smashin' through the East.
5-0 couldn't even catch where I was in the Chevy wit hella speed.
Hopped up out my vehic.
Seen cops hidin' in the trees.
Slapped my mutha fuckin' Mac-10 cuz them P.D.'s they will bleed.
In my back pocket is a Radio Shack C.B.
Watchin' my back be lil Steve, signal me when they leave.
Cuz niggas ain't goin' down no mo'.
For the 9-6 fuck the 4.
Fuck off fully both of they doe.
Wit nitro gas for the murda show.
Get to they shop, and hit the back door.
Some of you niggas don't really know.
Real killas don't need a, 4-4 to make that niggas, head blow.
Put bombs in his pick up.
I bet ya'll niggas won't see him no mo'.
Cuz when that mutha fucka blow.
No come back, everybody gonna go.

For the Thug Money.
They jack a nigga for nothin'.
I be leavin' you dead in the alley.
This kill a 5-0 Cali.
For the 9-6.
These woody-wood all in my mix.
Bust a nigga upside his head for arguin' wit a bitch.
I think I'm tired of these woodies.
So I gathered up a million niggas.
And burned them Big Willies.
Straps! I need to find some fullys.
And a gang that is sure to clean your crowd.

Immediatey.
Black and white drop ridin' through the spot.
And tryin' to stop my flow, cash.
So I gotta get that ass.
They radioed a rigg up.
So I'm on feet like ???
Plus I'm a getaway.
Tell the crew, put my shit away.
Change my description.
And fired up a C.F.A.
Crooked cop came.
I-LL-A.
Everythang went on thugs in the O-A fuckin' K.
They, know the A.
They ended D.
The enemy.
And these house niggas, and peckerwoods harrassin' me.
So I'm harrassin' back.
Hot on the roof top wit my gat.
Fuckin' blast it!
Splat!
Suspect he dressed in black.
I.
Left 'em layin' flat.
Ghetto bird don't know where I'm at.
Tucked under.
And sneakin' on another fuckin' task money.

** 4x.

From the cradle to the gravin'.
Misbehavin'.
Like a fuckin' stowaway.
Trunk full of throw-aways.
Glocks.
Tech's.
AP's.
Mac's.
Fuck wit 'ol skool Richie Rich you get you ass taxed.
Nigga Hitler was a killer.
Frank War was a mack.
For all my years in the game I got so many gats.
Nigga.
It's for the race war.
Don't wanna face more.
Niggas than I can handle.
Blowin' 'em out like candles.
Have you ever seen a nigga work a thirty-eight.
For the, drug money.
To stuff under the rug money.
Rich and 3 Times.
Niggas thought it wrong.
It's Blunt Funk for the scratch.
Once again it's on.
I hate to kill, but I will for the skrill.
Into my section, for the leathal injection.
AK-47, hundred round gas-aholic.
Smokin' these clips and can't call it.
Nigga!

** 4x.

Nigga!
