Chitown's Finest Lyrics
by The Union.

Twista.
Yo check it out.
It's the Twista in the house.
Representin K-Town, Westside of Chi.
No lie.
You know how we do it, Mobstability style.
Adrenaline rushin, suckers facin the repercussion.
I'ma set it off like this though, check it out.

You just a bitch in disguise.
I hear cries, cause you can't whistle for your guys.
Surprised when you saw these pistols in yo' eyes.
Show no fear like mere mortals.
Cause I shoot bloody portals, through motherfuckers orals.
Niggas dyin, causin horrifyin pictorals.
My passion for blastin made me an assassin.
On all other meat shift workers.
Who's purpose is to serve ?? til they clientele hurtin.
Murders got em nervous, I pull my weed and gun out.
Blast until they run in the house while I got the blunt in my mouth.
Yo Mob blast, I'ma defeat you, run 3-2-1 Contact.
Cognac, get me shot with a black gat itchin to bomb back.
Hoes can't get no sleep when I sent yo' chief.
For the greenbacks you bring us.
Shots hit his vest as he grabbed his chest.
As I watch him bleed through his fingers, now come one come all.
But if all come, all fall, fuck y'all, we raw dogs.
That'll come gunnin, niggas runnin like they soldiers.
In the heat of the night if you lookin for static to start up.
Guards up, or bring them straps and come ready to mob up.

?
My motto is I'ma live my life fuck the slow and puffin herb.
Gettin boss ?, while my money's doublin on the curb.
So fuck a job, I'm bustin stains and my idol's Kane.
In school I maintained, but at night I was shakin brown brains.
Alluminum foil, servin before it's spoils.
I got yay on the boil and my inner circle is loyal.
And critically acclaimed in the category of gangbang.
Constantly showered in black rain, as we bring the pain.

Twista.
You done crossed our inner circle - now I'm fin' to hurt you.
Cause the Mob peeped all of your loopholes.
Let the trigger work you.
Bust all of you bitches, and all of you hoes.
When the blunt come, stunts better run shit.
Look what a thug sprung.
See what drugs done?
When I hug the gun it make murder for my loved ones.
Thought you was down to die but you been found a lie, so fuck you.
Can't trust you, gotta bust you.
Plus you nigga can't get licks in hustle.
Try to flex your muscle but my criteria overcomes your strategies.
Try to make a Mob patter please.
I can rat on you and ? an amount of G's.
Musta had a lot of bud in him.
I can barely bludgeon him, whip out all the stud in him.
But I ain't even stunnin him.
Then again he's gone, so I just put a slug in him.
Dug in him dead and I'm headin then hoes off at the pass.
Open up a can of kick ass.
Toi aren't we loyal, G's out quick fast.

Ms. Toi.
Yo, it's that, West Coast diva from the Chi.
That keepin that P, in the pimpin, so let's fly.
To, ??, over here today, to lay down the.
Funk me and Twista display.
Can you even comprehend this ghetto feel.
I got my own type of slang and I keep my shit so real.
So hold your sack, nigga so you can get back.
It ain't a damn thing I lack, I kicks all of the facts.
So artifacts, and you artifical game players.
It's Ms. Toi with The Union and we straight slay ya.
You haters can't even, try to trip with this, respect the Ms.
It's all about that swiftest, Ms. represents.
And me, in Cali, I hit that Richter scale.
Focus to be mobbin with the tightest females.
But oh well, oh well, if that shit don't go down.
From Inglewood to Chi-Town.
Momma Militia and Twista straight clip ya.
It's me, slicin the necks of MC's.
With my homey Twista in the Windy City.
It's me, slicin the necks of MC's.
With my homey Twista in the Windy City.
Yeah.
