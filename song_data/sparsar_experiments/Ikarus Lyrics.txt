Ikarus Lyrics
by Quanche.


Runnin'? Who talkin' ‘bout runnin? We hide in plain sight, right in plain view.
You analyze me, so I guess that means I can analyze you.
Or analyze darkness, I think I might become recluse.
Take in the scenery let it seduce.
Call up the other me beg for a truce.
I'm to the plane from the porch id be lost without my torch.
But they ignored, I said “hey I'll illuminate the way”.
But no nobody wanted to listen.
All falling a victim of wishing.
I think I'm falling a victim of tripping; I dunno what is the same from what.
is the difference.
Help!

I think I'm dying young.
But the light from the Moon is just reflection from light that was given to it.
by the Sun.
Either you give or receive “I Told You So”'s.
We ringin around the rosey now this life is just one big Dosey Doe.
Oh, Oh.
X2.

When we fly what is it that make our wings flap?
And when we look up in the sky, what are we looking at?
And if it all were to come toppling down around you.
You try walkin' but there's nothing to ground you.
Where would you lay your head down?
Where did your wings go?

Laugh and we cry.
Hurt and we smile but all'a the while happiness hides.
Somewhere way deep waiting for someone to seek.
Rather to sink.
Waiting for someone to feel rather than think.
Open your hands open your hearts.
Know that when all of this finishes marks the beginning of when it all starts.
And if time seems to just be ticking by.
Do the things that we see still exist when we choose to close our eyes?
I dunno what they told me, so I dunno what to tell you.
They say it's not good to be lonely but that might just be something that they.
sell you.
I need help.

I think I'm dying young.
But the light from the moon is just reflection from light that was given to it.
by the Sun.
Either you give or receive “I Told You So”'s.
We ringin around the rosey now this life is just one big Dosey Doe.
Oh, Oh.
X2.

When we fly what is it that make our wings flap?
And when we look up in the sky, what are we looking at?
And if it all were to come toppling down around you.
You try walkin' but there's nothing to ground you.
Where would you lay your head down?
Where did your wings go?

Interlude.
“They don't know nothing brethren.
Only thing they know is how to kill and destroy and wreck and break down.
That's not liberty, that's not life that's death and destruction.
So obviously that can't be what I'm about.
Because I'm about life, I'm about liberty.
