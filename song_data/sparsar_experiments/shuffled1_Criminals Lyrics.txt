Criminals Lyrics
by Annie Mell Monroe.

And now I got steeze and they're all aplauding  .
So yeah I got purp haze and I got cream  .
Wishing for a day I'm finding bigger checks  .
Perez said Get them so I got them  .
With Luanne by my side sitting in the first class  .
And I am never going to hold my tongue for shit  .
.
  .
Hip hop is dead but I'm real motherfucker.
Chill motherfucker  .
  .
Nigga, words really do have a meaning  .
Goddamn  .
Dressing the haze in a french cigar  .
So please shut the fuck up, get off my dick  .
last name  .
Color the canvas in my mind with beautiful pictures  .
  .
We get shot on the block just for spitting some rhymes  .
And it's no problem how I rock that stage  .
Can not handle half of me  .
And I'm doing me while you sit on your ass  .
Got a blunt and a label and I'm taking lead  .
Set a record better flip the yellow page  .
Right from Manhattan, dressed in Supreme  .
The ladies on the streets know I'm trill motherfucker  .
  .
And drugs have a way to evoke a new feeling  .
And I blow dank  .
I'm the biggest motherfucker since Pharrell to hit the page  .
Everybody on the street who knows me wants to fuck me so they can all have my.
And I work for the money, get bills motherfucker  .
So come between me and my future and you're absurd  .
Liberating every single note been ever caged  .
Phisycs is phisycs but fuck gravity  .
And I spit fresh  .
  .
  .
Who dropped a new beat nigga that's mine  .
So judge me for being who I want to be  .
Call my dudes up, but I'm moving kind of slow  .
Criminals; they say that's who we are  .
Cause I don't talk shit  .
Land in New York, drink syrup get throwed  .
Don't want to stay here so I'm flying off  .
  .
  .
Put me on a stage I re position all my rage  .
  .
