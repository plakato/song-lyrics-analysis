Death In 3s Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.

I'Ma come in on the fifth just tell me when you start 
 
Uh 
Kill em, where he stands then stand over him shake his hand, 
Then jump back in that minivan double back to the block and blam 
I ain't backing down for nothing, 
, 
Y'all, niggas rock 16S fuck wit, 32s 
U, think you hard, but Reggie got off 20 and hes 32 
Kliq deep out the south, but D niggas run grimes 
Plus. My niggas from the Chi is dirty too 
Treach from the 3rd. Just sent me pic of his chevy sittin on 32s 
I respect the hustle, but I'm tryna get the lick off 32s
