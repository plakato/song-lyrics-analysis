Don't Trust Me Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Black dress with the tights underneath.
I've got the breath of a last cigarette on my teeth.
And she's an actress but she ain't got no need.
She's got money from her parents in a trust fund back east.
T-t-t-tongues always pressed to your cheeks.
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth.
You tell your boyfriend, if he says he's got beef.
That I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him.

She wants to touch me, woo ooh, she wants to love me, woo ooh.
She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh.
Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho cause the ho won't trust me.
She wants to touch me, woo ooh, she wants to love me, woo ooh.
She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh.
Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho cause the ho won't trust me.

X's on the back of your hands.
Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands.
And the set list, you stole off the stage.
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page.
Br-br-br-bruises cover your arms.
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm.
And the best is, no one knows who you are.
Just another girl alone at the bar.

Shush girl, shut your lips.
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.
I said shush girl, shut your lips.
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.
I said shush girl, shut your lips.
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.
