Don't Trust Me Lyrics
by 3OH!3.


Black dress with the tights underneath 
I've got the breath of a last cigarette on my teeth. 
And she's an actress, but she ain't got no need. 
She'S got money from her parents in a trust fund. Back east 
T-t-t-tongues, always pressed to your cheeks 
While. My tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth. 
You tell your boyfriend. If he says he's got beef 
That, I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him. 
 
She wants to touch me. Woo ooh. She wants to love me woo, ooh, 
She'll! Never! Leave me woo ooh, woo, ooh, ooh, ooh, 
Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho 
Won't trust a ho cause. The ho won't trust me 
She wants to touch me. Woo ooh. She wants to love me woo, ooh, 
She'll, never, leave me woo, ooh, woo, ooh, ooh, ooh, 
Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho 
Won't trust a ho cause. The ho won't trust me 
 
X's, on the back of your hands, 
Washed them in the bathroom to drink. Like the bands 
And, the set list, you stole off the stage, 
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page. 
Br-Br-Br-Bruises cover your arms 
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm 
And. The best is no one knows who you are 
Just another girl alone at the bar 
 
Shush girl shut your lips 
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips 
I said: shush girl shut your lips 
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips 
I, said: Shush girl shut your lips 
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
