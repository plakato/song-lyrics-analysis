To the Top Lyrics
by WordPlay T.JAY.

Info about the beat.

Lord forgive them for they do not know.

I'm never the same, so watch what you're saying.
I'm done with the plain nigga I came in like Blaine.
I been had the fame, been on my deck like a stain.
Bout doubting and pouting and making you thousands was taking me damn near.
insane.
I know my position tell Kendrick and Drizzy I come for the top.
So yo come and get me I told you don't tempt me I come from the rock.
Where drug dealers get on the back of this nerdy young nigga.
Notorious small and I'm itching for making it bigger.

You never know where the peak of my talent.
Greenery seen and I'm eating a salad.
Make it appear with a couple of ballads.
Get your head down, duck like a mallard.
Sipping JD from the mouth of a chalice.
Bored for a minute I'm seeking a challenge.
Taking this home so get out of my palace.
I lay the beat down, take out the pallet. Rest.

I been willing, never chilling, hot as grilling when I kill it.
They can feel it, Lord I'm spilling, my communion with my feelings.
Paint the ceiling, styles a million, think I'm kidding, grew up illing.
See my growth elevators in the building and I take it to the top.
I take it to the top, yeah I take it to the top x2.

I'm never the same, so watch what you're saying.
Keep picking my brain I'll never be stuck in one lane.
I been through the pain, I seen all the change.
But doubting my talent and giving you power was taking me damn near insane,.
aiight.
I know that I'm gifted too slim for the picking I see that you're shocked.
They mention my name envision my reign I come here to pop.
Can't figure me out you'll never be stopping these riddles.
Like laying her down I'm taking it up through the middle.
