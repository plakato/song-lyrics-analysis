Bust Shots Lyrics
by Wu Block.

Produced by Frank Dukes.

Pretty Tone, I got you, fingers.
Morphine flow, lean on the brass.
gold.
I can see your snake eyes without the crap roll.
Bust the mack stroll, laughing at you assholes.
Sticking thorns in my pride like the Black Crowes.
Cracking your dome for breakfast,.
Deck spit.
Lava, fresh like the produce.
section.
Repping, there's no use testing, you know who stepped in.
It's Deck bitch, for those who question.
Like Serena on the serve, I swing hard.
Main event, bad broads with ring card.
This shit here, niggas get the fiend nod.
On the wreck, though, these cowards never seen yard.
Head boss, you scavenge off what Deck toss.
I don't fall for petty talk I check the source.
Flex force with army arms, I lets off.
Bomb threat, blow both your stanky legs off.

IDAnd make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah.
SLOr, try and learned it from the mental shit, son.
IDAnd make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah.
Method ManBlaow, bang, cuz.
GKCuz I write, and blast and slash your whole level.
SLOr, try and learned it from the mental shit, son.
IDAnd make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah.
GKYeah, kid.

Pay attention, gun shots, fuck what you benching.
Big chains on my neck, my wrist is Clinton.
Presidential Rolex, coming out the.
projects.
Seat back looking mean in a foreign object.
Three for twenty in Japan, with American money.
Get back home, get head from American bunnies.
My Iron Fists, my platinum wrists.
My cook up game is chemists, fuck my nemesis.
Fly birds like Tyson do, had to switch.
From the car to the cargo on board Jet Blue.
Bodies drop from the Liquid Swords, been making hits for years.
But I'm mad I ain't got no awards.
I'm a real OG tho', swag like James Bond and 'em.
My white tee is my tuxedo.
Belts on the track, Sheek and Ghostface.
Got the hood on smash, RZA leave it like that.

We be jammin', I grill on the track just like salmon.
I don't play no games, baccarat or backgammon.
I'm Supreme Cliente', rawer than sushi.
And if your girl got my number, means I beat that pussy.
Sword slayer, dick slinger, I got the stroll.
Of an R&amp;B singer, Wu-Tang ruckus bringer.
36 different dialects, we call.
spot checks.
My homeland security, is up in the projects.
Shaolin, Stapleton, Bricks on Broad Street.
That's where niggas get chopped up like raw meat.
Fuck that, started off rocking a stocking.
Over my face, now my face is what gets it popping.
Donnie had the wave voice, beeing blowed through the mic.
The definition of TRU TV, fuck SPIKE.
I'm the realest Akeed that ever wet these blocks.
Too black for BET, too wild for.
Cops.
