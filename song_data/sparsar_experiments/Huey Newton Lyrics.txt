Huey Newton Lyrics
by Xali.

They told me, be less vicious.
My nigga what?
Diggin' ditches with deep diction.
Two motherfucks, metal fork or MILF stickin'.
One mother stuck my sex game so flow gifted.
That's different strokes no strokes jokes, Gary Coleman.
I terry the numb, the torment from this cold land.
Chase the dough man, see a poor man.
Never hold the whole hand.
*Steal from a dome, feel assault at your whole hand?*.
More demented than predicted.
The bad seas sprung among a field of born Christians.
I'm Moses as a baby, distract by a casket.
Downside of the basket, chasing after this bad shit.
Pass this, reminisce it, when you pass piff.
Blue dreams, seeing sad scenes from my last hit.
Coupe niggas told me get they ass and they cash quick.
Make profit for pussy and profit pussy and packaging.
That might be some STD's passed with it.
Nigga, keep it moving. Don't trust her pass for shit.
Still, we stay real. No silicone in the syllables.
Steady sucking simple balls, sealed down by silly hoes.
Navy seal in your phonebook, get your hoe took.

Call it no look.

I'm from the motherland, killing slave masters by my brothers hand.
Let the slave beat ride nigga.
The house servants whose purpose is just to hide triggers.
All through the masters house when they ram shack.
Feeling in the air, like a lick behind a gram sack.
Broke dealers stuck up on the corner smoking half they owe.
That addiction to deep hits taking half they soul.
Xali, aggressive action.
Soul flows so tactical.
Chaotic invasion, we lack control.
Mentally we pick cotton.
This rebellion is an option.
Cotton.
Higher knowledge.
Cotton kush for your conscious.
Bart Simpson explicit with a nappy motherfucking fade.
Choked out from tucking J.
Farmed out my fucking brain.
What a shame homies.
My brain turns insane in the contained lonely.
Couple niggas told me they gon' put it on me like Janoby.
Niggas reside where hoes be.
One of you bitches show me.
Still waitin' my nigga.
