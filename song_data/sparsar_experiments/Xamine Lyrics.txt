Xamine Lyrics
by Xeezy.

I was born alone.
I'm ma die alone.
I'm an I-phone.
You? You just a dial tone.
Some say life's a bitch,well I hope she gives this dog a bone.
Some say life's for cup...well I'm Styrofoam.
Honey I am home,mi casa es su casa.
It's well known you a lying king,&amp; I'm Simba,so move faster.
They looking up to me,&amp; I ain't even that tall....
They looking down on me,ma ni99a I ain't that small.
See I'm just tryna ball.
I'm just tryna have it all.
I ball in any weather.
They ball until they Fall.
&amp; that's a weather reference,I don't care whether they get it at all.

I'm black enough already,I ain't tryna be nobodies shadow.
Life is short my nigga,you here today &amp; you gone tomorrow....
After joy comes sorrow....
What a stupid race....
Cause if you think about it,happiness was in the 1st place....
Guess it was saving face....
Like a plastic surgeon....
Am I my own worst enemy,what an easy burden.
I'm so ahead of my time,my parents ain't met yet,my head is hurting.
Constant fights internally like I was 'Fight Clubs' Tyler Durden.
The more you know you ain't normal....
The world ask you to fake it....
You were born as God's creation,&amp; the world asks you to make it.
It's as if you standing naked....
See there are people out here who are for yuh....
&amp; others,well they out here forsaken.
So I've chosen to keep to myself &amp; I'm ma let this world go....
I've chosen to accumulate this wealth &amp; I'm ma let these girl's go.

But I dunno?!?.....
NO HOMO....
But You.Only.Cute,Online shawty....
YOCO....
Why ni99as acting like donkeys over camel toe?
Pussies chasing pussy,as if they don't know....
As a dick cums so a dick goes....
I'm a Trini SwaggerZ president,to you Marilyn Monroe's.
You Marilyn Mon-hoes.
You marrying these hoes.
You taking her out,&amp; then you propose.
You've fallen in love? Then look out below....
Cause even a dick stands for what it wants bro...
Ughh.

All you can see is me....
&amp; all I can see is you....
You're an obstacle,an obstacle.
Get out my way,get out my way...
Cause if you stay,then I'm ma go.
&amp; I'm ma grow...for sure.
Cause it's all I know,it's all I know.
You mad? Why you mad bro?
Is it cause how I be,getting this dough?
Yuh done know.
Yuh fuck with me.....
It's not so.
It's hard for me to say that I'm ma let you beat me.
It's hard for me to say....
But I gotta do what I must do.
I gotta do what I must do....

I was a miserable child....
Born young,free &amp; wild....
Mama's African Prince,I guess that means I was born in the Nile.
Born in denial.
Yeah that last line made me smile....
Cause I was a pharaoh's step son,so I was bound to be exiled.
&amp; that's when X formed...X Malcolm.
A couple years after Djalo' was born.
Yuh see I couldn't play soccer so I named my son a soccer star.
He'd be the reason I'd watch re-runs all season,on the television bruh.
....
See girls call me weird,&amp; I'm just glad they call at all.
We balling all season,these ni99as only ball until they fall....
A weather reference, whether you get it at all.
&amp; I don't care who's there....
Is you scared....
Whether we weathered the storm....
I'm gone....
