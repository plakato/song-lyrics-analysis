Best You Never Heard Of Lyrics
by Sycosis.

Best You Never Heard Of 
 
Best you never heard of. If I'm on it, then its murder/Got, a lot of niggas sleepin like a Sealy
or, a Serta/Bet this
bomb, wake em up/Three dice shake em up/Call, it Ceelo. We know we no equal/Imma break em up
/Best of the no
names/You one too. I run through your whole crew/Spit tuberculosis, sick, since
â€˜02/A, lot of bad music
bad, rappers bad actors, bad trappers/All, saying the same shit like dad
backwards/I'm sittin
stuck in it never made a buck from this/But chastity belt flow. No, I'm not who you're fuckin with
/Yeah. You can try it
maybe him. Maybe them/But battle me. I guarantee you lose something. Maybe a limb
/Arms legs. Oh, my hail
mary go wide/I'm almost to that goal line a gold mine, no I/Won't quit for shit cuz, I'm the pride of
this city/And, the city don't know me, but gon na pay me what it owe me
/ 

Nice to meet you best. You never heard of/ 
 
Everybody rap, but I go harder. Go further/, 
, 
No ego. I see no equal/ 
 
Know, it's been done before, but I'm different, no sequel, 
 
Feel, like the struggle, is needed to be completed/Could, be how I perceive it 
real shit. They don't receive it/Bullshit, somehow believe it/So, I switch it up
like seasons/On this mic, I'm like a heathin/Beat a beat up. Til, it's bleedin
/And fuck, a band-aid
I'm hand-made fan blades/Swingin at your chest, protect your neck Inspector
Deck/You too young to
get that I'm 12 gage on kick back/Steady talkin. That you're shit, crack/Your shit, wack, my
shit, back/Excuse, the
cursing/I'm, confused end discussion/You, like him cuz he's rich when it's
obvious that he bluffin/Naw it's nothin, really fam. I understand/Been making
hits back to back like pitching underhand/And. You respect it and ain't got ta. 
Like it/Call me Sycosis in your head. Like a psychic/At, your throat winter ice pick/On, this beat like a night stick/When
you. See me bow down like you've, been knighted/Nigga. Try it 
 
What. Do you do when you're better than your idols/Bust? Still, a lightweight 
can't compete for the title/A bunch of crabs in a bucket/Tryin to fake it, til
we make it/They, don't give it got ta take it/If. It'S a record. Watch me break it
/A bunch of bitches 
y'all gon na Rickie Lake it/Show, my ass, on a track. I swear, I'm really naked/My
notebook is sacred/Pen got me spiritual/Lames cured when they touch me/Still
performin, miracles/Hard
beats and lyrical/This. What you been prayin for/Watch. It come back
around/That's. What we been waitin for/But I'mma do it/Go against me: must be
stupid/Butter duck and
cover your head/Like, you Muslim or you Jewish/Realest, and the truest/Freshest and the newest/I don't
believe in being topped/See me I'm like a nudist/And me. I'M like I do this/And
you you shoulda knew this/Best. You never heard of your fault foolish
