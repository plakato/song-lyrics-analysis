Best You Never Heard Of Lyrics

Best You Never Heard Of.

Best you never heard of if I'm on it then its murder/Got a lot of niggas sleepin like a Sealy.
or a Serta/Bet this.
bomb wake em up/Three dice shake em up/Call it Ceelo we know we no equal/Imma break em up.
/Best of the no.
names/You one too I run through your whole crew/Spit tuberculosis sick since.
â€˜02/A lot of bad music.
bad rappers bad actors bad trappers/All saying the same shit like dad.
backwards/I'm sittin.
stuck in it never made a buck from this/But chastity belt flow no I'm not who you're fuckin with.
/Yeah you can try it.
maybe him maybe them/But battle me I guarantee you lose something maybe a limb.
/Arms legs oh my hail.
mary go wide/I'm almost to that goal line a gold mine no I/Won't quit for shit cuz I'm the pride of.
this city/And the city don't know me but gonna pay me what it owe me.
/.

Nice to meet you best you never heard of/.

Everybody rap but I go harder, go further/.

No ego, I see no equal/.

Know it's been done before but I'm different, no sequel.

Feel like the struggle is needed to be completed/Could be how I perceive it,.
real shit they don't receive it/Bullshit somehow believe it/So I switch it up.
like seasons/On this mic I'm like a heathin/Beat a beat up til it's bleedin.
/And fuck a band-aid.
I'm hand-made, fan blades/Swingin at your chest protect your neck, Inspector.
Deck/You too young to.
get that, I'm 12 gage, on kick back/Steady talkin that you're shit crack/Your shit wack my.
shit back/Excuse the.
cursing/I'm confused end discussion/You like him cuz he's rich when it's.
obvious that he bluffin/Naw it's nothin, really fam I understand/Been making.
hits back to back like pitching underhand/And you respect it, and ain't gotta.
like it/Call me Sycosis in your head like a psychic/At your throat winter ice pick/On this beat like a night stick/When.
you see me bow down like you've been knighted/Nigga try it.

What do you do when you're better than your idols/Bust still a lightweight,.
can't compete for the title/A bunch of crabs in a bucket/Tryin to fake it til.
we make it/They don't give it gotta take it/If it's a record watch me break it.
/A bunch of bitches,.
y'all gonna Rickie Lake it/Show my ass on a track I swear I'm really naked/My.
notebook is sacred/Pen got me spiritual/Lames cured when they touch me/Still.
performin miracles/Hard.
beats and lyrical/This what you been prayin for/Watch it come back.
around/That's what we been waitin for/But I'mma do it/Go against me must be.
stupid/Butter duck and.
cover your head/Like you Muslim or you Jewish/Realest and the truest/Freshest and the newest/I don't.
believe in being topped/See me I'm like a nudist/And me I'm like I do this/And.
you, you shoulda knew this/Best you never heard of your fault, foolish.
