Celice Lyrics
by A-ha.

You open up my eyes, made me want you, made me want to  .
Celice, it's in the way you hurt me  .
 Celice, I know that I'm alive   .
Wrap yourself around me, hold me tighter, hold me tight as only you can  .
Celice, it's in the way you hurt me  .
  .
.
Celice, you sharpened all my senses, I know you're on my side.
You know it feels so nice, hold me tight now, hold me tight as can be  .
Celice, you sharpened all my senses, I know you're on my side  .
Celice, it's in the way you hurt me, Celice, I know that I'm alive  .
Open up inside, make me want you, make me want to  .
Celice, it's in the way you hurt me  .
  .
  .
Celice, it's in the way you teach me, Celice, to chase the thoughts away  .
