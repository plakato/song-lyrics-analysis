Put the Bestsellas in a Bag Lyrics
by Yung Peen & The Sacc.


One time for your motherfuckin mind.
I give sight to the homeless, bread to the blind.
I said that backwards motherfucker can't you tell?
Fuck so many bitches and I'm bout to tell your mom.
About my dick in her ass.
I better wake her up first, maybe after class.
They call me Yung Peen, or the genital.
Smokin crack and meth but mostly the medical, marijuana.
For the Jonny Drama I'm Bananas.
Bandanas, period blood, 13 year olds.
Yeah you lookin good bitch, I see you shine.
You lookin good in my furnace, yeah you a dime.
Uh, Peen.

The way we be spittin, you ain't ever seen.
It's that kid the Sacc, with J-Math and Peen.
On my clutch flow, like Reggie Miller.
Yeah this beat is a jew, so consider me Hitler.
I'm not a fuckin rapist, that was only once.
But she gave me consent when I showed her my gun.
If you were watchin the throne, I guess you wouldn't see.
Ya nigga the Sacc burstin on the scene.
Quicker that Big Sean, FFOE.
Finally Famous Over Everything except for, me.
Haha, Sacc.

First name Swag, Last name Fuck it.
Got 3 bitches on they knees, all about to suck it.
I get high.
Do anything to get by.
Catch a bullett get a dot like Terminators eye.
Got that wet flow, in the pussy fist deep.
Wiz's skinny ass for a lyric once a week.
I'm the bullet in your gun, the feelin thats still to come.
I'mma keep on fightin till this war is won.
Don't fuck with me.
Cause I'm a P.I.M.P.
Got the pussy lined up, my cock's about to fill it.
We out now boys, J-Math just killed it.
Cocks.
