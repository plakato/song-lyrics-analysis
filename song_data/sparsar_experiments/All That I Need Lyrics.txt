All That I Need Lyrics
by Wretch 32.

Talking:.
It's crazy, cah I remember when I never felt like this.
It was only the other day I was lying next to you.
I remember I done ish, you forgave me.
Even though I can't say.
But we both know that nothing lasts forever.
listen.

Cah I am not with you no more.
You're no good for me, you're just bringing me down.
My sun shines in the rain while you're giving me clouds.
I once cried and complained now I'm kicking out.
Cah I refuse to live in doubt, I don't trust you.
It's weird 'cos I love you, but fear cannot love.
Who it chooses to scare.
Now I'm stressed out losing my hair.
What's next I ain't losing the year.
You're supposed to be my crutch.
As of lately you provoked me enough.
Especially when I'm closed to being up.
I'm finishing my album, you're tryna kick when I'm down and.
Focusing on other tings, a real woman's supposed to be mothering.
Not like holding a grudge and ting, when I'm in the studio late.
And when I don't come home for a few of the days.
Out the week, that just means that I'm doing it babe.
Allowed to speak, of course you are.
But don't force it cah.
I never liked that you crossed the line.
You said something that shouldn't even crossed your mind.
And that's a criminal sentence so do the time.
Without me. I'm just doing I.
Allow me I am through that wire.
I'm now free, I am moving higher.
I'm proud to see that you're cruising higher.
but I am not beside ya.

All that I need.
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days, I say.
All that I need.
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days, I say.
All that I need.
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days, I say.
All that I need.
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days.

We got one, another one's on the way.
And right now we don't know if that one's gonna stay.
Plus I can't look my son in the face, cah I remember the day.
That I told his mum to chuck him away.
But she never listened.
She gave birth I was there to vision.
It's a boy was the words I whispered.
and I remember that look on your face.
When the nurse said Push it again.
You're like I can't mommy; I was like You're pushing it babe.
You're like It's hard bubby, the tears would fall on your face.
I'm like Go on honey.
Then I gave you a kiss on your lips.
it's weird that I'm picturing this.
Cah fast-forward as I listen to this  - pissed.
listen we learnt a lesson that we'll never dismiss.
Cah I never thought we'll end up like this.
cah perfect films always end with a kiss.
And I swear we're at the end of the script.
Cah every time I try read you, I just remember the b*tch.
I try leave you, and then I end up in bits.
I don't think this could ever be fixed.

All that I need.
Is my own space, cah I've been chilling on my own for days, I say.
All that I need.
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days, I say.
All that I need.
Is my own space, cah I've been chilling on my own for days, I say.
All that I need.
Is my own space, cah I've been chilling on my own for days.
All that I need.
All that I need.
All that I need.
All that I need.
All that I need.
All that I need.
All that I need.
