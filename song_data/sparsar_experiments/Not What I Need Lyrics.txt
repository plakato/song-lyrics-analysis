Not What I Need Lyrics
by Xazz.


You left me with that taste in my mouth.
You walked out through the bedroom door.
How many times you knocked me around.
'Til I'm not who I was before.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.

When you come here again.
I won't be lying around like that old time friend.
My time here has come to an end.
But it's you, you're not what I need.
When you come here again.
I won't be lying around like that old time friend.
My time here has come to an end.
But it's you, you're not what I need.

Bet it's hard shrugging off all the blows.
When you're the one who's creating hope.
Put down your plowshares and exchange them for swords.
And all you've got is a lonely soul.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.

When you come here again.
I won't be lying around like that old time friend.
My time here has come to an end.
But it's you, you're not what I need.
When you come here again.
I won't be lying around like that old time friend.
My time here has come to an end.
But it's you, you're not what I need.

Oh, oh, oh oh.
Woah, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh.
Oh, oh, oh ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah, ah.

When you come here again.
I won't be lying around like that old time friend.
My time here has come to an end.
But it's you, you're not what I need.
When you come here again.
I won't be lying around like that old time friend.
My time here has come to an end.
But it's you, you're not what I need.
