Grounds for Divorce Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.


You said you hate the sound.
Of the buses on the ground.
You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town.
Said, Pretend it's whales.
A-keeping their voices down.
Such were the grounds for divorce, I know.

On the radio.
And the bouncing body drone.
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone.
Said, Look at the clouds.
It's a show all on its own.
Such were the grounds for divorce, I know.

But the dialing is dead.
We hit it on the head.
It looked like a wedding cake.
But the dialing is dead.
We hit it on the head.
It looked like a newlywed.
But I look at the lovers.
And the way they stand.
And the way they move, and the way move their hands.
And look at their babies.
And their tiny little hands.
And the way they get loved, and the way they get loved, oh.
Oh, look at the lovers.
And the way they stand.
And the way they move, and the way they move.
And the way move their hands.

Looked like a newlywed.
On the radio.
And the bouncing body drone.
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone.
Said look at the clouds.
It's a show all on its own.
Such were the grounds, such were the grounds for divorce, I know.
