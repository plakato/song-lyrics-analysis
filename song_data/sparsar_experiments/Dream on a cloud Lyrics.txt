Dream on a cloud Lyrics
by Twitchy.


Chill shit, trill shit I be on my ill shit.
Rappin' out the cloud thundershockin' to the ground.
I'mma keep goin' till my breath stop flowin and my talent stop growin'.
You already know it's goin' down.

Wake up get out bed.
Still thanking based god that I'm not dead.
Look out the window and I see a gray sky.
Today would be the perfect day to skate or get high.
Get dressed in somthin' fresh.
Diamond supply or supreme would be the best.
I'm an ignorant kid.
Doin' the type shit that you wish you would've did.
I still got ambition.
Aimin' for hopes, dreams and every single vision.
But it takes work and a lot of dedication.
Gettin' stressed out like I need some medication.
I'll kill the game one day, premeditated murder.
Swear i'll do it, don't really care how bad I hurt her.

Goals to fuckin' conquer.
Twitchy started in the game just as a little monster now im tearin' up the.
scene.
Was livin' in the clouds, but now I'm soaring in my dreams.
Killing all these rappers with my words and laser beams.
A narcissist, so target this.
Rap I'm fucking hard at this.
Got no other life apart from this.
Other rap is marketless, go head and light a spark to this.
I'm fightin' this, I'm thinking while im writin' this.
Enlighten this, dark goes into lightness.
Bow down to your highness.
I see the fuckin' sight in this.
Your flesh i'll put a knife in this.
Yes you can fuckin' fight to this.
Leave em numb like Vicodin.
Oh god twitchy is high again.
I don't support drugs, but you can light a pipe to this!
