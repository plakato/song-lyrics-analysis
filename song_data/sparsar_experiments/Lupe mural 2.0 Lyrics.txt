Lupe mural 2.0 Lyrics
by TygaStan212.

We all are programmed by the government 
In a partnership 
To ski in the mothership 
Of. Our electorate, 
The republicans want to disintegrate the freedom we have so righteously en-
governed with our current state of government. 
The Public wants to redesign congress, but we can't, with this oil war and
killing of suburbanites living in Iraq, 
Worried to have their next meal and scared of impoverishment and its
evident.
