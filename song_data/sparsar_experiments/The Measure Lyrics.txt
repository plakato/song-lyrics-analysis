The Measure Lyrics
by SycAmour.

Fuck, Again.
I want to be a man.
But I love all the sin and the cigarette ash.
Black lips, Amen.
I want to be a saint.
But I love all the darkness, lights just burn my skin.

Let me in. Let me in.
I can make em understand, I can be your favorite.
Lover. Under all the blood and cement.
I know can be the sun, I can see the lights.
Flickering above your sanctuary.
Guide children of the night into the vultures den.
Fluorescent white light beams through window frames to lie to mankind.
Deaf, dumb and blind, all fall in line, in time to worship the sun.
But it's cold outside.
Won't you come in?

What is the measure of a man who.
Used to believe in something, used to believe I'd change everything but.
I can't remember why.
Now I can't find the time to light this fire behind my eyes.

Oh, what's to show.
A million-and-one love-lost souls?
You wanted control.
But we both know:.
We'll thrive where you can't see the lights.

Drug obsessed. 6 o'clock, stimulants.
I need my medication. Pump it in my veins doctor.
Am I an actor? My stage falling apart.
But I can't see the sun. I can feel my heart.

Oh, what's to show.
A million-and-one love-lost souls?
You wanted control.
But we both know:.
We'll thrive where you can't see the lights.

Never been alive a day in my life.
Tried to find god but we're running out of time.
Never really thought that I could trust you.
Come to find out that's all that I can do.

I want to die.
Spill my life-force, watch it drain out of my veins.
I'm to blame.
Pain derived from my self-righteous poetry.

I want to die.
Spill my life-force, watch it drain out of my veins.
I'm to blame.
Pain derived from my self-righteous poetry.

What is the measure of a man who.
Used to believe in something, used to believe I'd change everything but.
I can't remember why.
Now I can't find the time to light this fire behind my eyes.
