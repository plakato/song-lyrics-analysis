My Russia (Standing On Hands) Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

The morning comes.
Cold and bright as I need it.
The morning comes.

No one asked any questions.
For fear that I might answer.

Cold and bright as I need it.
The morning comes.

Hide me in your hand.
With the mother of my children.
The morning comes.
Where the land sinks deep in it's color.
Bless the ground where we kneel.
Safe in your woven creel.
Cold and bright as I need it.
The morning comes.
You speak as no other.

The morning comes.
I've not yet closed my eyes.
Cold and bright as I need it.
The sun does rise.

These were my thoughts as I.
Passed neath your window.
I saw you through stained glass.
With only one eye.

For I am everything.
I am everything.
I am everything that he is not.
