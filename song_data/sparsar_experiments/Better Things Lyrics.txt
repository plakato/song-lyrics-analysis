Better Things Lyrics
by The Swellers.

I'm on my way to better things.
Your definition states that they're not here.
I'm on my way to bigger things.
I guess you wouldn't know since you're not here.
It's not the friends you thought you had.
Or your location on a map.
It's what you feel in here.
I'm on my way to better things.
It's not the first time, not the last time.
I'm on my way to better things.
I wish you well.
I'll be just fine.
If I stay around I can feel alright.
But I know there's something else out there for me.
It's not the friends you thought you had.
Or your location on a map.
It's what you feel in here.
I'm on my way to better things.
It's not the first time, not the last time.
I'm on my way to better things.
I wish you well.
I'll be just fine.
Home is where you make it.
And I'm not afraid to say it.
I'm on my way to better things.
It's not the first time, not the last time.
I'm on my way to better things.
I wish you well.
I'll be just fine.
I'm on my way to better things.
It's not the first time, not the last time.
I'm on my way to better things.
