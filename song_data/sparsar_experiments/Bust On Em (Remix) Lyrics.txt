Bust On Em (Remix) Lyrics
by Z-Mane.

Opening: King Henry.
Yup!
Now see what we got here.....
Is the remix.....

We got Z-Mane....Tone....
And ya boy King Henry.
Leggo!
You know we stay bustin on these niggas.
Reppin' Royalty Gang until I go, bruh.
King shit, nigga!
Haha!
You already know what it is, mane.

We bout to bust on em, we bout to bust on em.
We bout to, we bout to, we bout to bust on em.

Y'all don't know who you dealin' with.
Mess with me and hurt is what your feelings get.
I ain't worried bout it, I don't want no problems.
Me and my crew, man, you know we steady ballin'.
{Man, we bout to bust on em, we bout to bust on em.

We bout to, we bout to, we bout to bust on em.
}.

King Henry, I hope all these niggas hear me.
My flow eerie, yeah, it make these niggas fear me.
I bust on em, have 'em lookin' like an accident.
Fuck your opinion cause I'm all about the facts and shit.
Yeah, I rep that RGOD so you know I'm blessed.
My team runnin' it, you have to stop and take a rest.
I killed Dial Tone, then I killed Goldie.
Now , everybody know me!
Got so many chicks, you would think this was a hen house.
Started from the bottom, now we chillin' in a penthouse.
Naw, I'm just playin', but I'm still livin' life.
And when I get to bustin', it's gon' be a hell of a night.
Yeah, that's the right cause I'm the king, ho.
It's Royalty, I got a crown on my ego.
It's too big, too strong.
Me and Z, we bout to bust on 'em.
Leggo!

Z-Mane Talking.
Ok... We stay bustin' on em, mane.
Henry, my nigga, I see you.
Alright, look.

Now, I'm a killer, my nigga, you just soft as a chinchilla.
And when my crew get to bustin', you gon' be in for a thriller.
Man, we on top of the pillar, you should call a grave digger.
Cause when we step on the scene, all we gon' do is kill ya.
Man, we bustin', niggas can't be trusted, it's pitiful.
I'll bring him down to size, have him lookin' like a mineral.
It's simple, though, simple hoes swaggin' in their simple clothes.
Askin' can she get a ride, hit her with a simple no.
So cold, man, a blanket won't help me.
You messin' with my temperature, nigga, gon' get dealt with.
Trust me, ain't no rushin' when my niggas get to bustin'.
Best believe we'll leave you dusted and disgusted, you bustas.
You know the rules, my niggas, we keep them tools.
But we ain't Handy Manny, hope you understand it.
Yeah, man, it's Royalty Gang.
We always reppin' for the crown, it's a loyalty thing.

Z-Mane Talking.
What?
Y'all thought that Z-Mane and King Henry.
Were the only ones that be bustin' on niggas?
Let me call my nigga from the V.A.
Ayo, Tone, holla at 'em, mane!

Uh!
Leave your girl with me, she's mine, I ain't speculating.
Her long hair I will pull, there ain't no hesitating.
Anger I see in your eyes, I'm down for instigating.
Type of nigga to take your bitch, leave you masturbating.
Jergens recommended, my nigga, I'm just saying.
These long nights will catch up with you and I ain't playing.
Too many smuts out here so I ain't ever paying.
Too many sins in my life, I'm like God dammit, Satan.
Hold up, now you ain't seeing me go dummy, nigga.
Hold up, not settling here, I'm not that comfy.
In the position I'm in is kind of rugged, I'm not that lucky.
Seven deadly sins so my mind is always flooded.
Lean my seat back two feet up and I say fuck it.
You making buckets, tuck it in, I ain't tryin' to hear it.
On the rise, my reign is spreading quick.
If you were smart, you would learn to fear it.
Fear it.

Now, bust on 'em, bust on 'em, bust on 'em.
Naw, I can't trust 'em, so I keep a close eye.
I got wings on the paper, so I let the dough fly.
Don't cry, my nigga, everybody fails.
On that kiddie stuff, call that nigga Dragon Tails.
Yeah, I'm addicted to the game like my boy Nor...

Come on!

We bout to bust on em, we bout to bust on em.
We bout to, we bout to, we bout to bust on em.

Closing: King Henry.
King shit, nigga!
