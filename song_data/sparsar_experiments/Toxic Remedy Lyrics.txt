Toxic Remedy Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.


What symbol would you choose.
To decorate your final breath?
You contemplate then choose.
The misery that serves you best.

It's too late to realize.
You can't dismiss your past.

So look around.
The time is now.
It's time to beware.
Your liquid toxic remedy.
It's time to beware.

Time to beware.

Every breath you take.
Might be the last you get.
Looking back, do you see sad eyes.
Like who you are.

Melting faces upside down.
Confinement is your friend.
Solitude that's never found.
Forgive me father, I live in sin.
