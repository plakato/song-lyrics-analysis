Xan By The Pound Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


Nigga you ever notice how like a local rapper'll, get on a song and be like 
Nigga. You know who the fuck it is. 
And, I just be like Nah nigga, we don't. Fuck it 
 
Might, have bad bitch. Send me nudes! Might skateboard wit' a few white dudes 
Might, throw a party wit', my sister Might roll a blunt or just sip my liquor. 
Might stay local or I might go outta town I been in field and I'm never
outta bounds. 
If I get in the game, then I'm goin for the crown 
Know a couple: niggas move xan by the pound, 
They might merk a nigga. If I ever give the word 
I might call my ex. If ever get the nerve. 
And tell her I'm on I'm on. I'M on tell her I'm on I'm on I'm on 
Bitch we eat'in eat'in eat'in I'mma, breath of fresh air
