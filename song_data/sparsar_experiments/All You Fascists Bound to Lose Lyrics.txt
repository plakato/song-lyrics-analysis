All You Fascists Bound to Lose Lyrics
by Billy Bragg.

Gonna tell all you fascists, you may be surprised.
People all over this world are getting organized.
You're bound to lose, you fascists are bound to lose.

People of every color marching side by side.
Marching 'cross the fields where the million fascists died.
You're bound to lose, you fascists are bound to lose.

All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.
All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.

All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.
All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.

I'm goin' into this battle, take my union gun.
We'll end this world of slavery before this war won.
You're bound to lose, you fascists are bound to lose.

Race, hatred, cannot stop us, this one thing we know.
Your poll tax and Jim Crow and greed have got to go.
You're bound to lose, you fascists are bound to lose.

All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.
All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.

All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.
All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.

All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.
All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.

All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.
All you fascists bound to lose.
You fascists bound to lose.
