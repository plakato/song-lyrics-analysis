Conjuration of Terror Lyrics
by Xasthur.


dominate the crimson sky, demonic shadows shroud the heavens, the codes they.
dreamt  engravings on their skin. Faith.
led to their own end, nothing remains to resurrect, judgment day took a morbid.
turn, Christ set the fire, for all to burn . Running.
out of tomorrows and tomorrow is now. The weight of ignorance cursed all their.
beliefs, yet curse the children who have nothing to pray to. Vomited blood,.
human waste blessed the centuries . A.
torturous reflection remains of a spherical demise.
