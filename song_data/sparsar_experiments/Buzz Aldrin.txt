Wouldn'T it be cool if we were astronauts, 
Zero gravity, two-one-blast off 
Take, my hand, it's time to leave this place. 
Wouldn'T, if be cool. If it were both of us 
Circumnavigate map the stars out 
See the world from here in outer space, 
 
We're not trying to get away 
Just wan na see if the sun stays 
When, we go to sleep 
And I'll, hold your hand. Past Mars, 
If Orion looks at you wrong. 
I just may need to beat those pussy-ass stars: 
 
5-4-3-2-1. Let'S take off 
5-4-3-2-1 
5-4-3-2-1. Let'S take off 
We're clear to go: 
 
Everyday, we'll eat, toothpaste and pretend we like the taste 
 
WE CA, N'T, LOOK BACK 
If! We were astronauts, 
Zero gravity, two-one-blast off 
Take, my hand, it's time to leave this place, 
Wouldn't, if be cool. If it were both of us 
Circumnavigate map, the stars out 
See the world from here in outer space, 
 
Wouldn't, it be cool. If we were astronauts,
