Let Me Take You Home Tonight Lyrics
by Boston.


Now I'm not like this, I'm really kind of shy.
But I get this feeling whenever you walk by.
I don't want to down you, I want to make you high.
If you you could see your way to me, come on and let me try.

Let me take you home tonight.
Mamma now it's alright.
Let me take you home tonight.
I'll show you sweet delight.

You must understand this, I've watched you for so long.
That I feel I've known you, I know it can't be wrong.
If we just get together, I want to make you see.
I'm dreaming of your sweet love tonight, so mamma let it be.

I don't want to make excuses, I don't want to lie.
I just got to get loose.
With you tonight.

I don't want to make excuses, I don't want to lie.
I just got to get loose.
With you tonight.

I don't want to down you, I want to make you high.
And I get this feeling whenever you walk by.
If we just get together, I want to make you see.
I'm dreamin' of your sweet love tonight, so mamma let it be.

I wanna show you sweet delight, show you sweet delight.
Pretty mamma want to show you sweet delight.

Let me take you home tonight.
You know I want to take you home.
Let me take you home tonight.
I don't want be alone.
Let me take you home tonight.
Let me take you home tonight.
Let me take you home tonight.
