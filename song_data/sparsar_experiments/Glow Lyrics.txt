Glow Lyrics
by Ruse.

This broken step.
This low lit room.
This tired clock.
Shines red light through.
And I'm alright.
Then down the hall.
I hear you breath.
I know you're there.
Though I can't see.
And I'm alright.
I'll let you go.
I'll let you go.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
You start to glow.
From head to toe.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
The sails are down.
The rip tide sea.
Tears apart.
The hull and Beam.
And I'm alright.
Then through the dark.
It's all I see.
A lighthouse.
Like sun to me.
And I'm alright.
I'll let you go.
I'll let you go.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
You start to glow.
From head to toe.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
You know I can't stay.
So give me away.
And you know if you cannot handle it.
You can keep that light house fire lit.
I'll let you go.
I'll let you go.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
You start to glow.
From head to toe.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
