1 Thing Lyrics
by UNIFIED GIANTS.

“1 Thing” by Unified Giants Featuring III Generation.

Aye.
Ok… Lets get it.
The life… The life.

The life that I live a steady struggle trying to make it.
Positive thoughts yet the negatives erasing.
The richer get rich and the poor is just facing.
Obama politicking like he gone really change this.
But you ain't getting respect unless your ass famous.
And still I thank God for the skin that I came with.
I'm taking over the world.
No pinky and the brain shit.
Money be my language.
Red carpet flow …
Shaking hands with the A-list.
My song across the world rocking playlist.
Turned to the max blowing speaker with the bass kit.
Mind on cloud nine.
Bars pull up in a space ship.
Repping Compton I was born and NWA kid.
I'm way past tired of the hatred.
Face it… life's to short to be basic.
Face it… life's to short to be basic.
Face it… life's to short to be basic… nigga.

1 Thing about me…
I'm all about money.
Wake up…
And go and get money.
For the kids…
We go and get money.
All of us right here.
We go and get money.
Get money.

I never ever wanted more than my fair share.
Amongst the wolves and the bears.
Chasing hares while chilling there.
Feeling kind of hungry… and yet I'm hungry for a hippo.
All black limo… windows on a fish tank.
I'm going hard in the paint we toast with fine drank.
For days may god bless it.
Laughing all the time through the grind.
So why stress it.
Hopping that your lessons are learned.
Your style is burned.
Just for hating on a rhyme…
To tell the truth that never crossed my mind.
See signs I'm out for mine.
To combine with real legends.
Talking mill to one odds my dude so why bet.
Then right when I said it…
It got her wetter than a mermaid.
She paid and tried to play me close.
Them check stubs on stack I'm working the most.

1 Thing about me…
I'm all about money.
Wake up…
And go and get money.
For the kids…
We go and get money.
All of us right here.
We go and get money.
Get money.

1 Thing about me…
I'm all about money.
Wake up…
And go and get money.
For the kids…
We go and get money.
All of us right here.
We go and get money.
Get money.
