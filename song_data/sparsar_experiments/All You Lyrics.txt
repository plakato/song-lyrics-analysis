All You Lyrics
by YungKing.


Tonight we gonna make a movie.
So let me get a preview.
I'm coming through to see you.
So wear that thing see through.
Cause' I'm tryna see it all.
I don't want a piece I want the whole thing.
Girl I want it all.
Exploring every inch of you.

She telling me to come through.
Finna hit the liquor store before two.
Bring over a bottle we gon' rendezvous.
And she gon' bring her friends too.
I love what that sound like.
Yung King and the ladies, baby all night.
And we all feeling alright.
Gotta have two bad ones by my side.
We sipping the night away.
And I ain't tryna to run game.
I just want to have fun.
And stay away from these lames.
These girls bad and wild.
And they digging my style.
Open the magnums no lifestyle.
Cause' we gon' be here for a while.

Tonight we gonna make a movie.
So let me get a preview.
I'm coming through to see you.
So wear that thing see through.
Cause' I'm tryna see it all.
I don't want a piece I want the whole thing.
Girl I want it all.
Exploring every inch of you.

At the kickback and there's hella bad ones.

Go ahead girl, shake that thing.

Around four A.M running off no sleep.
Bottles poured up and these girls want to freak.
They got their titties out and showing cheeks.
I got a sweet tooth girl I need a treat.
They all top notch, they a class act.
With a fat ass, they well stacked.
I'm trying to go and hear that thing clap.
Drop it low then bring that ass back.
Already had the preview.
Now I want to give the review.
Baby girl you know I see you.
And these girls want to be you.

Tonight we gonna make a movie.
So let me get a preview.
I'm coming through to see you.
So wear that thing see through.
Cause' I'm tryna see it all.
I don't want a piece I want the whole thing.
Girl I want it all.
Exploring every inch of you.

Already had the preview.
Now I want the review.
It's time to try something new.
So girl this your debut.
Already had the preview.
Now I want the review.
It's time to try something new.
So girl this your debut.

Tonight we gonna make a movie.
So let me get a preview.
I'm coming through to see you.
So wear that thing see through.
Cause' I'm tryna see it all.
I don't want a piece I want the whole thing.
Girl I want it all.
Exploring every inch of you.
