Don't Go Breaking My Heart Lyrics
by 702.

So many nites.
I felt your beating heart.
As we were deep in the dark.
I'd watch you sleepin' tight.
Protect you from the light.
As if you were a child.
&amp; put a kiss on your lips.

Don't you go breakin' my heart.
Stay for awhile.
I'll make it alright.
Cause if you go breakin' my heart.
I won't survive.
So stay for tonite.

This can't be right.
Cause each &amp; every time.
I look deep in your eyes.
I see the shinin' stars.
Beatiful work of art.
Still we just never part.
Let's talk it through.
You &amp; I.

Don't you go breakin' my heart.
Stay for awhile.
I'll make it alright.
Cause if you go breakin' my heart.
I won't survive.
So stay for tonite.

Is it somethin' that I should have done.
Tell me where did I go wrong.
Is it somethin' that I could've said.
To make you stay around the way.

Don't you go breakin' my heart.
Stay for awhile.
I'll make it alright.
Cause if you go breakin' my heart.
I won't survive.
So stay for tonite.
