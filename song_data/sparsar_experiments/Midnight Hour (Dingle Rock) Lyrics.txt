Midnight Hour (Dingle Rock) Lyrics
by Viza.


He said she said, “Lay out the deathbed” to which i smiled wide and bright.
Upside, downside, along the hillside a dingle rocks each fortnight.

Live fast we burn our money.
Live fast we churn our minds.
Live fast we fill our bellies.
At last we dance tonight.

Take this hand and don't let go.
Rocking through the midnight hour.
Lose yourself and lose your soul.
Rocking through the midnight hour.

Rocking through the midnight hour.

He said she said, “Lay off the redhead”, to which i howled high and wide.
Moonrise, sunrise, and counter clockwise a dingle rocks round and round.

Live fast we burn our money.
Live fast we churn our minds.
Live fast we fill our bellies.
At last we dance tonight.

Take this hand and don't let go.
Rocking through the midnight hour.
Lose yourself and lose your soul.
Rocking through the midnight hour.

Rocking through the midnight hour.

Make a wish and soon you'll know that those that wish are those that crow.
Dance across the seven seas and face the crow so gallantly.

Rockin through the midnight hour..

Take this hand and don't let go.
Rocking through the midnight hour.
Lose yourself and lose your soul.
Rocking through the midnight hour.

Rocking through the midnight hour.
