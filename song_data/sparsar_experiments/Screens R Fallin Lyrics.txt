Screens R Fallin Lyrics
by Yungstar.


Crawlin' through the city Benz lit with Five screens.....
Europeans sticky greens.
Promethizine that make me lean, it seems like a dream.
Dressed clean with a pinky ring.
Hit the button, wave the trunk, my camcorder peepin' schemes.
Blades chooppin' like karate, i done streched a mazarati.
Sippin drank and join my hottie, screenz stalling wide body.
Swang through the subdivision, screens fall Flex vision.
As I ball for postion, makin a throwed decision.
On a mission expedition makin'em have a collision.
With lyrical ammunition wreckin all competition.
Screens fallin' when im crawlin' through the Tre down Dalton.
Lane stallin', shot callin', while the trunk be haulin'.
Ballin' out of control at 19 years old.
Give me the remote control i seen this episode.
Game's throwed, minds blowed, when its time to hit the road.
Lil' James is the name, I put the T in throwed......

Come out to play ridin' on 4's.
Turbo graphics 16 with split screens in da door.
Come out to play ridin' on 4's.
Stoppin' at a sto doors open and close.
Screens r fallin' down.
To da ground.
Like da rain like da rain.

Watch out now da screens ganna fall.
Watch them kay isolated 20 inches ganna crawl.
Screens fallin' down on a hot summer day.
All da kids screamin, FLEX CAN YOU COME OUT TO PLAY?
Everything is everything watchin' color TV's.
We roll blades, e600's, 64 chevy's on knee's.
Televisions on da panel screens lit up like candels.
Satellites, DVD's, T Y P on each channel.
Fifth hangin' off da bumper blades slicin' like shredder.
8 screens in the van watchin 2 double headers.
Burnin' rubber, grippin' grain, shake da block, switchin lanes.
We beatin' down da block makin' resident's complain!!!!
Swangin' wide bubble eye screens fallin' like rain.
Cars bouncin up and down as I slide down Main.

Come out to play come out come out to play come out come out to.
Play come out come out to play.
Come out to play ridin on 4's.
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da door.
Come out to play ridin on 4's.
Stoppin at a sto do's open and close.
Screens r fallin down to da ground.
Like da rain like da rain.

Marble red watch ur head, da screes ganna fall.
20 inches ganna crawl known for vibratin' walls.
Trunk shake, scrape da plate, down da 288.
TV sets, Ricky Lake, Moesha my date.
2 Story with a Pond German Rott Home Alarm.
AK's dat harm we ready to rip out arms and.
Tough chests with bullet proof vests.
Armed and dangerous ready to kill.
One arm holdin' wheel other hand grippin' steel.
Screens fall 2 X 2, watchin' winnie the pooh.
Change da channel scooby doo trunk beatin' da screw.
Lil' Pooh nation wide I got infinite pride.
My do's be suicide, blades swirl and slide.
Wreck da scene, hoes fiend, ima throwed young teen.
Creased up Dressed Clean in a marble machine.
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da do.
Steady pourin 4's do's open and close.

Come put to play ridin on 4's.
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da do's.
Come put to play ridin on 4's.
Stoppin at a sto do's open and close.
Screens r fallin down.
To da ground.
Like da rain like da rain.

Like Warren G I want it all screens fall when i crawl.
We Young We hard Knockin Pictures Off Da Wall.
BOOM BOOM goes da trunk caues its a hard knock life for us.
20 inches leaving cars in da dust.
Its a must screens drop as I skate real fast.
I be watchin' Tom &amp; Jerry proped up on glass.
Lexus Cope switchin' gears when I hit St. Claire.
People see me drippin' candy screens fall form da air.
Or da sky ridin high look im fly Oh My!
Screens fall from everywhere make you hoes wanna cry.
Me and my cousin' Lil' Jermaral in a Benz or Camero.
Flippin' all through out da land lookin for Dexter and Pharoh.

Come out to play ridin on 4's.
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da do.
Come put to play ridin on 4's.
Stoppin at a sto do's open and close.
Screens r fallin.
Down to da ground.
Like da rain like da rain.
Come out come out to play.
Riddin on 4's turbo.
Come out to come out come out to play.
Ridin on 4's.
Come out to play come out come out come out come out to play.
Come out come out come out to play ridin on 4's.
Come out come out come out to play ridin on 4's.
Come out come out come out to play ridin on 4's turbo.
Come out come out come out to play ridin on 4's.
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da do.
