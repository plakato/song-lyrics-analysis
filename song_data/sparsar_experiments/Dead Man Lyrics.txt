Dead Man Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

And I was once a dead man.
A stranger with no home.
I stood opposed to God himself.
And yet He pardoned me.

With all my heart.
And the fiercest will.
Desired not but to.
Thieve and kill.

I hadn't a thought of peace, but war.
Surrender was not what I'd endure.

I was a murderer.
Filled with lies and deceit.
Faced with my list of crimes.

Deliver me!
Wake me up from this damning sleep.
I'm surrendering.
Pull me out from this wickedness.
In this thieving heart of stone.
I realized all these sins.
I could not atone.

I was a murderer.
Filled with lies and deceit.
Faced with my list of crimes.

And I was once a dead man.
A stranger with no home.
I stood opposed to God himself.
And yet He pardoned me.

So just at the right time.
When we were dead in our sins.
You took this heart of mine.
And gave me life again.
And gave me life again.
This is where I begin.

So far apart.
And a debt to fulfill.
This purchase bought on redemption's hill.
An ailing disease I couldn't cure.
Oh this grace!
How rich and pure!

Abide in me.
My God!
I am found in You.
Pardon me.
My God!
You know my deepest thoughts.
Deliver me from sin.
I am made anew.
I'm surrendering.
This heart.
For which Your blood it bought.
For which Your blood it bought.
For which Your blood it bought.

The mob, they yelled and screamed for justice.
That wrath was ours, we are to blame.
You made a spectacle of rulers.
Denying You of a king's fame.

Having crushed the written cannon.
That wrote of all our guilt and shame.
Displayed upon the tree it was nailed.
The saving power of Your name.

And I was once a dead man.
A stranger with no home.
You saw this wretch and You gave my life.
Forever I'll praise You!

I will praise You!
