A Game Named Life Lyrics
by Akala.


Um, In a game named life.
In a game named life.
In a game named life.
In a game named....

A game named life where fools make the rules.
And poets paint pictures with words that change nothing.
Survival of the fittest they say, are they sure?
Or just the survival of those with the will to kill more?
The heart that thinks itself purely, surely is not hungry?
Hungry hearts know too well, the world is fuckery.
And nature is indifferent to the suffering of infants.
That think ourselves growing human beings and something special.
But as fate would have it, I ain't buying the idea of fate.
It seems we shape every place that we grace with hate.
Depending which side of the fence or which epoch.
You die a slow death or be singing from the treetops.
Praise for the status quo, cus you're comfortable.
Those who lost out in this lottery, ha, fuck 'em all.
Nice with this roll of the dice, I'm quite proud and.
I don't know if we will ever roll another time round.

It's a game named life.
In a game named life.
In a game named life.
In a game named life.
In a game named life.
Where the dice decide where I go.
There I go, in a game named life.
I dream to be let go.

A game named life, where fools make the rules.
And poets paint pictures with words that change nothing.
Young child soldier, revolver not bluffing.
In a game that teaches children to kill but can't love them.
What is the journey of a bullet from the ground until we pull it?
A piece of earth made to blow holes in souls.
I'd like to know does a child choose in its mother's core or before as just a.
sperm to be born in war?
Does another sperm choose greatness floating in his father's pleasure?
Or does the game only begin when the umbilical's severed?
Is that the reason babies born screaming?
Because they know they left the spirit world.
To live here with no meaning among demons.
That see them as nothing more than chess pieces.
In a game named life where even the winners stop breathing.
And the whole thing is as tedious as a tale that is told twice.
We clone life but don't even own our own life.

Sacrifice, pain and strife.
This game named life is over.
Before we even know.

Life is a mirror always looking at you.
It's not what we say or think, we are just what we do.
With the time that is given it comes with no ribbon.
Because life is not a gift to everyone that's living.
Most of the moves are made before you took your first go.
Some got a huge head start before their first role.
So you could play with more skill than the other players.
They will still be head because the past generations.
Accumulated spaces so they could practice with acres.
Illuminated arrangements so they could manage retainers.
Are you foolish? They ain't racing we're chasing the pay slip.
So they have won before even the game starts unless we change it.
To another set of rules different from the fools.
But to do that we are going to have to use their tools.
And therein lies our greatest dilemma.
In this game named life, who's playing it better?
