Across The Universe Lyrics
by Rufus Wainwright.

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper. Cup

Pools of sorrow. Waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai Guru, Deva Om

Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world

Images of broken light, which dance before me like a million eyes

Thoughts meander like a Restless wind inside a letter, box

Jai Guru, Deva Om

Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open mind inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me. Like a million suns

Jai Guru, Deva Om

Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world
Nothing's gon na change, my world

Jai Guru, Deva
Jai Guru, Deva
Jai Guru, Deva
Jai Guru, Deva
