Comrade Lyrics
by Volcano Choir.

Like I didn't know it.
Choking on the pulp of it.
Semper Fi.
You kept me on your long line.
Tugging in the whole time.
Keep shining on.

And that silent head grip ....
Can't do it no more.

The honey bin.
The bunny's in.
Is telling you there's a countdown.
Oh, damn your eyes.

Had that one a long time.

Sorting out the long pipe.
Hoping that the copper fits.
Make sure you stay oblivious.

Said that we could go back.
Said that we could go find.
Terra forming!
Said that you were coke blind.
Drinking in dramnesic.
Tore out at the comrade.

That's a comrade, making a comrade offer.

That Ticonderoga's shit.
Made my mind and my heart all split up over.
The floor of the jackpot.
There's a floor to the jackpot.
Where'do you rise???

You don't even lie to me no more.

They say you ain't a comrade.
Still, I'd know you'd come back.
For a folly-ridden Romeo, you break down a fortress NOW.
Standing out in public.
Stained with your conscience.
I know that you love me.
You are just lawless, son.

Give it another fortnight.
Eye to eye the culprit.
Just rid the fucking pulpit.
I ain't giving you another full ride.
Underneath the combine.
Said it didn't bump you right.
Habitual falling right?
