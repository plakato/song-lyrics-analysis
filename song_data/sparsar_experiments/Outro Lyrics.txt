Outro Lyrics
by UNIFIED GIANTS.


Yeah… Yeah.
You are now listening.
Worldwide.
Yeah… yeah.
Uh-huh… uh-huh.

You trying to get brand new… yeah.
At times can be cool.
When you don't handle biz.
There's new things to do.
And plus I'm better to… yeah.
What brain don't like change.
Who want to stay the same?
It's almost like, they love the struggle main.
I shred a shirt getting mad at the thought.
With green skin blacking out on a song.
I'm feeling wrong for wanting more.
But laying talents to waste I know the word.
Then greed birds so early never went to bed.
Just to be first on a silly worm.
We'll never win if we don't learn.
Yet want you grooving when the song comes on.

My style programmed.
Like a robot.
And I keep going.
Till the show stop.
And you probably need it if you know or you know not.
And all I know is that I won't stop.

So we grind.
Like it's all-subconscious.
Subconscious.
Like it's all-subconscious.

Hustling.
Like it's all subconscious.
Subconscious.
Like it's all subconscious.

My style programmed.
Like a robot.
And I keep going.
Till the show stop.
And you probably need it if you know or you know not.
And all I know is that I won't stop.

So we grind.
Like it's all subconscious.
Subconscious.
Like it's all subconscious.

Hustling.
Like it's all subconscious.
Subconscious.
Like it's all subconscious.

It is in your subconscious.
To keep going…
To keep striving to be the better person that you can be.
Don't let that negativity bother you.
Remember.
That only you can do for you.
You set the tone.
Yeah.
Broadcasting… worldwide.
