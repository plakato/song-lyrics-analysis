Fantasy Man Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

This diamond's growing in the mountains.
Beneath the pressure of all time.
That glow in hope and expectation.
Waiting for your hands to find.
Cause only you could reach inside me.
And figure out the worth.
Of a life i live providing.
What it was you needed most.

And if everything is measured.
By the hole it leaves behind.
Then this mountain has been leveled.
And there's no more diamonds in the mine.
Go on now just leave it.
The timing wasn't right.
And the forces that swept us both away.
Was too strong for us to fight.

Fantasy man you are always.
One step ahead of me.
Well i never heard a warning.
I haven't got things right.
The sun came out this morning.
And filled my room with light.
So go now you are forgiven.
Let's put it down to light.
The story of two lovers.
Would dance both edges of the knife.

In the station you were standing.
Not knowing what you want.
And the secrets that we're defending.
Have become our only bond.
Just be patient while i wait here.
Journeys out of sync.
While you're out there running in the chaos.
I need some time to think.

Fantasy man you are always.
One step ahead of me.
Well i never heard a warning.
I haven't got things right.
The sun came out this morning.
And filled my room with light.
So go now you are forgiven.
Let's put it down to light.
The story of two lovers.
Would dance both edges of the knife.
