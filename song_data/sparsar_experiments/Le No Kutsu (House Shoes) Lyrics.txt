Le No Kutsu (House Shoes) Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Bones.


It's a good day, it's a good day.
Sure is, smoke.

I be out here smokin' weed with my motherfuckin' fiends.
And that's just what we do every motherfuckin' week.
Bitch, I'm out here smokin' weed with my motherfuckin' fiends.
And that's just what we do every motherfuckin' week.
I be smokin' weed with my motherfuckin' fiends.
And that's just what we do every day of the week.
Bitch, I'm out here smokin' weed with my motherfuckin' fiends.
And that's just what we do every motherfuckin' week.
Bitch.

Blade on my waist, blunts to the face.
Young Destiny's Child, bitches say my fuckin' name.
Young creep Bones, Motorola phones.

All gold cane, walkin' with a dame.
No fuckin' shame but these bitches know my name.
Old skate shoes, torn-up jeans.
Long hair swingin' like a young David Spade.
My bitch look just like me, fine to the teeth.
Power on my level, smokin' dope, drinkin' tea.
My bitch look just like me, fine to the teeth.
Power on my level, smokin' dope, drinkin' tea.

All I need is weed on me.
All day of the week, I'm smokin' weed.
I'm in a tree, I'm smokin' trees.
I got a lot of pretty women on me.
It's a fee to fuck with me.
I ain't free, that's on me.
You hate on me, you so silly.
Your girl with me, she say she lonely.
I say, Girl, what you doin'?
You over here, you over there.
You wanna come here from over there.
You don't like your nigga cause he a lame.
Everywhere that I be, I be smokin', bitch.
