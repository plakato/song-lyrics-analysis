Greek Tragedy Lyrics
by The Wombats.


We're smashing mics in karaoke bars.
You're running late with half your make-up on.
This method acting might pay our bills.
But soon enough there'll be a different role to fill.

I love this feeling.
But I hate this part.
I wanted this to work so much.
I drew up our plans on a chart.
Cars are flipping, I'm in hot pursuit.
My character's strong but my head is loose.

She hits like ecstasy.
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me.

The tarot cards say its not so bad.
And the blades rotate there's just no landing pad.
And better have said it but darling you're the best.
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps.

I hate this feeling.
But I love this part.
She really wants to make it work.
And I clearly want to let it start.
We'll build a water slide.
As soon as I get home.

Oh and she hits like ecstasy.
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me.
It's wrong but surely worse to leave.
Now she hits like ecstasy.
So free up the cheaper seats.
Here comes a Greek Tragedy.
