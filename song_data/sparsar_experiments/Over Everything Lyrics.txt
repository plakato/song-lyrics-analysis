Over Everything Lyrics
by Sycosis.

Over Everything.

In my hood they trying to ball.
Over Everything, Over Everything.
Ball Ball Over Everything.
These little niggas trying to ball.
Over Everything, Over Everything.
Ball Ball Over Everything.
All they think about is.

Money, Cash, Hoes.
Run the streets is all they know.
Reapeat 3x's.

These little niggas try to ball over everything.
In the streets with wedding rings/.
Married to the game.
They want that money want a name/.
For these hoes to holla out.
Fuck a school they all about/.
Getting cash and buying clothes.
Pelle leathers and Girbauds/.
And they strapped like them jeans.
They be teens serving fiends/.
They be 12 popping pills.
They be shell shocked for real/.
From they momma shooting heroin.
Fuck the world from here on/.
Daddy never getting out.
So we on that quick route/.
Is it worth it is it worth it.
All them problems that might surface/.
Just to stunt on these hoes.
Just to flex like Mr. Perfect/.
See that money just the surface.
You a pawn when you're a worker/.
You're a target by the D.A.
Same shit on replay/.
Possession of narcotics.
Intent to distribute happy b-day/.
Class X-Felony.
So what the hell you telling me/.
That 6-30 years.
Is it worth it all them tears/.
All them cell blocks and them tiers.
They know this but all I hear/.
Is they gonna ball Over Everything.

So whose to blame whose to blame.
For how these kids get crack cocaine/.
Mix it up with baking soda.
Cook it up over that flame/.
17 with a baby momma.
But his gang is all he claim/.
Tatted up with dread locks.
He think he Wocka think he Wayne/.
He be popping call em Yoppers.
He was awkward now he changed/.
He's a mobsta grab that choppa.
Pop Pop Pop ya out ya brain/.
Out that lane is hard to be.
Out this game is hard to see/.
Whats a college when your knowledge.
Of how to eat come from the streets/.
All you seen is a bunch of fiends.
All your hope comes from some dope/.
All you heard was flipping birds.
And all you fear is not making more/.
This ain't a movie ain't a movie.
But you Johnny Depp in Blow/.
Trying to make it 1 more run.
Until ATF kicks in that door/.
What you facing what you facing.
Best case probably probation/.
Get that band on your ankle.
Then the good Lord you'll be thanking/.
But you can't win you ain't in.
No different state of mind/.
You'll be back in 90 days.
Just a sign of the times/.
Trying to ball Over Everything.
