Reservoir Lyrics
by PUP (band).

Took a path to the top of the mountain
You walk forever just to meet me at the reservoir
Outta luck: outta money
Take, your clothes off meet me at the reservoir
Meet me at the reservoir 
Meet me at the reservoir 

I. Guess you live and you learn
I guess you'll get what you deserve

You're on your own
I'm, letting go at the reservoir
You're sinking like a stone
We. Had it all and it fell, apart

You only want it when you're bored with the quarry
I only want it. When I'm wasted at the reservoir
Outta touch, outta loving
The engines running and I'm wasted at the reservoir

My lungs are killing me. I didn't even get high
Forget longevity. We'Re just tryna. Get by
It isn't apathy, I just don't care. If I die
My lungs are killing me, I didn't even get high

You're on your own
I'm, letting go at the reservoir
You're sinking like a stone
We. Had it all and it fell, apart
What did you expect 
At the reservoir
You're sinking like a stone
I'm, letting go 

It's, never pleasure. It'S always work

Meet me at the reservoir 
Meet me at the reservoir 

I. Guess you lived and you learned
I guess you'll get what you deserve. 

You'Re on your own
I'm letting go at the reservoir
You're sinking like a stone
We, had it all and it fell apart
What did you expect 
At the reservoir
You're sinking like a stone
I'm letting go? I will stay afloat.
