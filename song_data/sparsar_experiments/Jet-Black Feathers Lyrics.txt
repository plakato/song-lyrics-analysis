Jet-Black Feathers Lyrics
by XamVolo.


Oh wait hold on a sec, 
I thought a brother wouldn't last and- 
Fortune was found in a casket 
Bright lights, fame, unsurpassed and- 
Oh, wait hold on a sec 
What about Bluegrass and Brass and-. 
Jazz gon' save the middle class with- 
Flat caps and dark sunglasses. 
 
Hold on 
So: this is the indoor cloud. Is it 
I promised that I wouldn't go loud with it 
Not quite the same as a vow? Is it 
Hold on 
To, the indoor cloud 
I promised that I wouldn't go loud 
Before the dark come-a. Take me away. 
 
And I get paid 
Like my guys say: 
Stick to the plan boy and nothing's changed 
When. This wind falls: we by Lambos 
Hit the main roads race'em, all together, 
Drifting weather trade, in peace for these jet-black feathers, 
 
Kings of the street to these middle class beggars. Clever, 
And. We ask how we got here. 
And we say: do your best, sir. Do your best, sir 
Do, your best to- 
 
Hold on 
To, the indoor cloud? Is it 
I promised that I wouldn't go loud with it 
Not quite the same as a vow? Is it now 
Hold on 
I promised that I wouldn't get proud 
Before the dark come-a? Take me away: 
 
Oh wait hold on a sec, it's about 2:59 
You done, missed your flight 
If. You could turn back time. And- 
Oh wait hold on a sec. You realised you can't 
Because. Your blood runs red 
Better, get your ass to Japan, somehow 
 
Hold on 
So. This is the indoor cloud 
You promised that you wouldn't get proud, 
Not quite the same as a vow. Is it now 
Hold on 
To the indoor cloud 
You promised that you wouldn't get proud 
Before the dark come-a? Take you away. 
 
And you get paid 
Like your guys say: 
Stick to the plan boy and nothing's changed 
When. This wind falls: we by Lambos 
Hit the main roads race'em, all together, 
Drifting weather trade, in peace for these jet-black feathers, 
 
Kings of the street to these middle class beggars. Clever 
And. We ask how 
And we say do And we say: do 
And. We do your best, sir 
And. We ask how we got here. 
And we say: do your best, sir. Do your best, sir 
Do, your best to- 
 
Hold on 
Do, your best sir.. 
Hold on 
To, the indoor cloud 
I promised that I wouldn't get proud 
Before. The dark come-a take me away..
