Jet-Black Feathers Lyrics
by XamVolo.


Oh wait hold on a sec.
I thought a brother wouldn't last, and-.
Fortune was found in a casket.
Bright lights fame unsurpassed, and-.
Oh wait hold on a sec.
What about Bluegrass and Brass, and-.
Jazz gon' save the middle class with-.
Flat caps and dark sunglasses.

Hold on.
So this is the indoor cloud, is it?
I promised that I wouldn't go loud with it.
Not quite the same as a vow is it?
Hold on.
To the indoor cloud.
I promised that I wouldn't go loud.
Before the dark come-a take me away.

And I get paid.
Like my guys say:.
Stick to the plan boy and nothing's changed.
When this wind falls, we by Lambos.
Hit the main roads, race 'em all, together.
Drifting weather, trade in peace for these jet-black feathers.

Kings of the street to these middle class beggars, clever.
And we ask how we got here.
And we say do your best sir, do your best sir.
Do your best to-.

Hold on.
To the indoor cloud, is it?
I promised that I wouldn't go loud with it.
Not quite the same as a vow is it, now?
Hold on.
I promised that I wouldn't get proud.
Before the dark come-a take me away.

Oh wait hold on a sec, it's about 2:59.
You done missed your flight.
If you could turn back time, and-.
Oh wait hold on a sec, you realised you can't.
Because your blood runs red.
Better get your ass to Japan somehow.

Hold on.
So this is the indoor cloud.
You promised that you wouldn't get proud.
Not quite the same as a vow is it, now?
Hold on.
To the indoor cloud.
You promised that you wouldn't get proud.
Before the dark come-a take you away.

And you get paid.
Like your guys say:.
Stick to the plan boy and nothing's changed.
When this wind falls, we by Lambos.
Hit the main roads, race 'em all, together.
Drifting weather, trade in peace for these jet-black feathers.

Kings of the street to these middle class beggars, clever.
And we ask how.
And we say do, And we say do.
And we do your best sir.
And we ask how we got here.
And we say do your best sir, do your best sir.
Do your best to-.

Hold on.
Do your best sir...
Hold on.
To the indoor cloud.
I promised that I wouldn't get proud.
Before the dark come-a take me away...
