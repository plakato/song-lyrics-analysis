On This Real Shit Lyrics
by Twistid Rob.


I'm about to kill the instrumental better check his pulse.
When I show up with my pencil and the murder case closed.
When I'm settin down my chopper and the syllables flow.
I like to play with the rhythm and I let it all go.
But it's cliche well these days with beats played like heat rays.
I eat grapes like kings wait for pete sake I beast rage.
On 3 page of 3 days a week and I see great.
Believe me it's D day I'll replay the relay is decayed.
The reverb has got words I be brave I concave.
Melody pop and kickflip to a catapult.
To a manual, patterns of an animal.
Eatin through these MC's like a bloodthirsty cannibal.
I am flammable, liquid nitrogen I shatter badifolds.
I glue bladderul, attackin you with dadderall.
I hack a saw I pack it raw I'm feelin like I just injected some Ritalin with a.
little bit of adderall.

But on this real shit I'm out for a mill tick.
It's still twisted as fuck and y'all gotta deal with it.
I'm ill fitted leaving chills when the pills kick in.
My wheels spinnin my grill grittin, I been sittin.
In a tiny shore room a hobby hole, if you have a problem with my place you.
gotta go.
I don't need you motherfuckers shoving down the throat, you comin with the.
Niko shit and never brought it no.

And I'm tired of these wannabes just chokin up the game.
They need a choke chain back to the yard where they slang.
Where they gang bang throwin up them gang signs, all these mother fuckers.
talkin about a gang life.
Seen it on the same side and it ain't right, they actin like they family but.
they ain't tight.
But when it comes to my division in the kitchen we be runnin up these recipes.
like motherfuckers wanna listen.
We give them boom watts and make those windows bend, a session in the studio.
is music for a friend.
Right before the casket I'll be slapping beats until the end, reincarnated I.
will do it all over again.
I don't like how these people look at me, they shake their head in misbelief I.
know they're hatin me, woah.

But on this real shit I'm out for a mill tick.
It's still twisted as fuck and y'all gotta deal with it.
I'm ill fitted leaving chills when the pills kick in.
My wheels spinnin my grill grittin, I been sittin.
In a tiny shore room a hobby hole, if you have a problem with my place you.
gotta go.
I don't need you motherfuckers shoving down the throat, you comin with the.
Niko shit and never brought it no.

And some of you motherfuckers can't even acknowledge the fact that you ain't.
got shit, but a turd polished.
Go ahead and roast it with some peppers and your olives, but you claim to be a.
killer and you know you're not honest.
Abe, your legs, they shake.
When it comes to confrontation, you break, you're fake.
Its time for you to wake...up, and smell the black silk.
Cause some of you are rotten like some motherfuckin bad milk.
You make me wanna puke, y'all be rappin firecrackers I'm about to drop a nuke.
Then I get to jukin, hadukin I move them, with one hell of an upper cut on.
your trail just like a spook.
I am crafted, Armageddon at its worst, you want me on your instrumental well.
I'm spittin first.

paid like I deserve.

But on this real shit I'm out for a mill tick.
It's still twisted as fuck and y'all gotta deal with it.
I'm ill fitted leaving chills when the pills kick in.
My wheels spinnin my grill grittin, I been sittin.
In a tiny shore room a hobby hole, if you have a problem with my place you.
gotta go.
I don't need you motherfuckers shoving down the throat, you comin with the.
Niko shit and never brought it no.
