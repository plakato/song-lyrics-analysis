Fearless Leader Lyrics
by Rustlah.

Be a part of the big fam, white picket fence.
Camera coated courtyard, wide angle lens.
All the perfect people form fair weather friends.
In the city of tents, they rise against the one percent.
Pound sign the revolution will not be televised.
Only youtube'd and tweeted, either love it or leave it.
They band around a man, a plan to bring back the land.
Turning cities into sand, something they don't understand.

You need a cause, you want to make a stand.
They see you coming, something you don't understand.
You see the flaws, they try to form a plan.
They need your fight, something you don't understand.

You port the leader, baby kisser, grandma greeter.
Born a teacher, eager to take the place of preacher.
True believer, embrace the face of fever, great deceiver.
With a taste for red states and placates the bluest bleeder.
Swoon a seeker, take the reigns of change by the heart strings.
Leaves its stain on the art scene, screen print hard scenes.
Of armies embarking on a dark king who bathes in golden buildings.
Speaks to millions like, Let's do this for the children!

You need a cause, you want to make a stand.
They see you coming, something you don't understand.
You see the flaws, they try to form a plan.
They need your fight, something you don't understand.

You're the man they churning in Manchurcian circuits.
Don't understand your purpose but its working, street's a circus.
The G man pulls your strings, immersed in Combine curses.
The masses thirst is bursting.
At first they seem like zombies, at worst they purely persons.
But you know that this is certain;.
You've done your job, the cops sic dogs upon the mobs.
The gods pass laws, they keep us cagey, safely confined within our jobs.
They give us streams to watch, and songs to sing along.
You thought you were the leader but in truth you played the pawn.
We port the past and smile and laugh and hope that nothings wrong.

You need a cause, you want to make a stand.
They see you coming, something you don't understand.
You see the flaws, they try to form a plan.
They need your fight, something you don't understand.
You need a cause, you want to make a stand.
They see you coming, something you don't understand.
You see the flaws, they try to form a plan.
They need your fight, something you don't understand.
