24 Bars Part 2 Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


I'm still in the cut with the mop.
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can get your ass sparked.
Since a nigga rap now, they think I got a change of heart.
Tryna drive on me and get your whole team parked nigga.
24 bars, bitch I'm back around.
We shoot up niggas blocks then come back around.
We really smoking shit, nah we ain't jacking clown.
Tecs with the cooler kit, glizzy, we keep them Macs around.
Bitch we love that clapping sound, we teed up, so we clapped them down.
We still got poles so don't tweak.
Team 600 on these blocks yeah my niggas play these streets.
Something like Udonis Haslem I'll never leave my heat.
We want war fuck the peace.
600 bucking heats.
Without guns pussy niggas get defeat.
Prepare for the defeat.
Cause I shit hot, hit a rap nigga and his body make his hip hop.
Walk up clapping like ratchet bitch flip flops.
I'm on some other shit.
Bars straight from the fire, yeah that's that oven shit.
Bitch I'm too hot to handle go get your oven mitt.
600 more than a gang, yeah them my brothers bitch.
They say I talk this shit.
But we a get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons.
Steve Drive, L'A Gang I'm a part of this.
I gave y'all 24 bars, lil nigga that's it.
