Tiderays Lyrics
by Volcano Choir.

You wake up.
Soft denim on the floor.
Spent nights last sleeping like two fours.

We're tall neither.
And the full fever.
And the dawn quakes.
Haste back the seething den.

Baby.
This is not sin.
Its nineteen ink-ings.
Or one fresh inkling.
On the hard nights.
You're the ace right.
And you would break down so gentle in my livery.

Now you're levying.
Past the sediments.
Now you're leveling.
Build up that benevolence.

Tiderays.

Yeah, whatcha didn't film matters.
Yeah, whatcha didn't feel flatters.
Whatcha didn't find tonight.
Won't honor them.
Cross the fast black platter.
Walk the plain, what's this matter?
Don't calm the evidence.
Build up this benevolence.

Sway for the tiderays.

Brace for the tiderays.
