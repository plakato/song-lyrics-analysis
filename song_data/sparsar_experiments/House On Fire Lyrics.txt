House On Fire Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

We got â€˜em buzzing / The engines are humming.
Everybody's screaming and running.
To get a taste of the madness.
Nothing to lose / Ain't waiting to move.
Shaking the blues / Breaking the rules.
It goes like this.
Come on, Come on / Give trouble just a little kiss.
Come on, Come on / Put your money where your mouth is.
We're gonna set the house on fire tonight.
We're gonna set the house on fire tonight.
Once in a while / There comes a new kind of style.
A freaky natural child / Who was born to be wild.
We do whatever we want / Whenever we want.
With whoever we want / Go ahead and try to tell us we won't.
Come on, Come on / Give trouble just a little kiss.
Come on, Come on / Put your money where your mouth is.
We're gonna set the house on fire tonight.
We're gonna set the house on fire tonight.
Burning bright, burning bright.
Till morning light, till the sky goes white.
Come on, Come on / Give trouble just a little kiss.
Come on, Come on / Put my money where your mouth is.
We're gonna set the house on fire tonight.
We're gonna set the house on fire tonight.
I'll be shooting like a pistol in a knife fight.
We're gonna set the house on fire tonight.
