Yesterday' Gone Lyrics
by Swerve.


One two, they don't see my pain, used to have a decent job till they stole my.
pay.

Tried to run a little oxy I was making cash then, but then the pan flipped man.
All my homies started fiending hollow lint tin foil.
And to top it off I think my girls leaving and she been loyal.
Guess its just a hard days work in the midst of all these evil people.
Tried to tone it down become a pot dealer.
Got robbed guess thats not the way that I topped either.
Quit slanging but about a week later got caught smoking on reefer.
Then they found this old text, put me up in holding up in GP.
But I swore to God I'd quit if they just release me.
Next week I was back up on them streets geez.
What you think I wasn't gonna eat? Please.

Fuck these police these crooked motherfuckers wanna see us all deceased.
Talk about us like we are the scum of these streets.
But I don't even see what they mean, I'm just trying to get some food for my.
seed.
Shit maybe just a shoes for they feet it ain't cheep these days.
Cost a grip just for groceries these days, and not to mention rent.
If I wanna read these days, gotta pay PG and E so I can see each page.
What the fuck you gon' tell me these days, can I live?
Nobody's out buying cd's these days, so if you wonder why ya'll ain't see me.
these days.
Shit thats just the way it be these days, Swerve.

Yesterday's gone, tomorrow is too.
And it's a hard road but we gon' fight our way through.
Said we gon' fight our way through, said we gon fight our way through.

? Searching for, I found that we all lost.
The little homie rolled up on me with that sawed off.
Anything not made of steel was getting sawed off.
UPS-ing fedexingme u-hauled off.
In that ghetto trance dance with the devils dance.
Fully automatic loaded metal in the metal lands.
I would never meddle with.
Taught to mind my own biz killed my body but my soul lived.
I was probably off 39 street with the dirty 9.
Couples of bodies on it tried to sell it don't nobody want it.
Word to Jay-O, Mama said a nigga need a J.O.B.,.
Mommy they owe me for poetic contribution.
Nah I never read the constitution, I skimmed through it.
Too much pain to manage, find a blankas canvas, and put the pen to it.
You relate because you been through it.
The blackest nights was my brighest afternoons.
And maybe after school we can meet up at the park some of my friends hooping.
My other niggas pulling triggers for they figures.
Fingers on the brink of death.
Think how you figure that a nigga got a through process.
He never blink drink blood from the cup of the thug.
Forever breathe through some gangsta lungs.
Don't let the ghetto be your guide.
You's a fool if you thinking that someones something you can't become.
Yo, I came up out the same slum, still in the same slum, been there since day.
1.
Yo, my curfew was at 7, the sun setting signifies that the days done.
Yo, when the pressure breaks bones, the now is forever and the yesterday's.
gone.
Yo, when the pressure breaks bones, the now is forever and the yesterday's.
cloned.
It's Co$$.

Yesterday's gone, tomorrow is too.
And it's a hard road but we gon' fight our way through.
Said we gon' fight our way through, said we gon fight our way through.
Said we gon' fight our way through....
