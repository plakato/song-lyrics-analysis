The Session Cypher Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf & Chris Travis.


Call me Captain Hitsugaya.
While i'm smoking frozen fire.
Don't you swear that you get higher.
Cause that might make you a liar, bitch.
The sky just passes by, as the smoke floats higher.
I stay high, bitch don't ask me why.
Bitch this is my life.
I'm alright, I be smoking right.
All day and night.
I'm on flights, higher than the flight.
Do you hear me right.
S.O.S, swing on sight you bitch.
Bitch you just a bitch.
Talk your shit.
Boy I put the whole fleet to your neck.
Boy respect, when you see right here.
Bitch I am the king.
Ice bling, ice gleam, I froze everything.
I'm too clean.
Hot water turns cold on me.
While you hatin' your girl putting hearts on me.
I don't like to really argue, cause that's not me.
I'll kill you with some facts, then smoke my weed.
Everyday i'm only working for what I need.
Some of you niggas claim ya'll flexin' but you lyin' through your teeth.

I stay high.
Bitch I stay so high.
Bitch I stay so high.

We stay high x4.
Bitch we stay so high.
Bitch we stay so high.

I sleep in polo clothes.
I wake up with 4 hoes.
My lungs is filled with smoke.
It like i'm on a boat.
And I be damned if I live rich then die broke.
And I be damned if I give these groupie bitches hope.
I fuck her so good that bitch don't moan like a frog she croak.
And bitch i'm counting green, you sitting at home doing 5 reports.
Let me know 1 thing can you answer this.
If you can't relate don't handle it.
Bitch my money growing big like an elephant.
I'm low key, but I stay in my element.
I can't lie everybody know it's evident.
Like a chick man you niggas is feminine.
Like a witch i'm aboard my enemies.
Hold up pause cause you girl keep sending me.
Most niggas try pussy.
And I ain't even tryin' to waste my energy.
Most niggas tried pussy.
And I ain't even tryin' to waste my energy.
Man I been the damn name.
And all my niggas ballin'.
But we in the same game.
All your hoes kick me back.
On some Liu Kang shit.
And all my old hoes tell me i'm getting too famous.
