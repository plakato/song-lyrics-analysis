VVe Crazy Lyrics
by Wonderstarz.

Yeah... West Side fans for life!
2Pac....

Been in the penitentiary, ain't even close to hell.
Ask me motherfucker I know it right.
Wonderstar- li'l piece of shine.
Ridin' right into the light of the night.
Make a persona, build up some rep and drop into this world.
It took years to make mine sound better than sandal and sword.
Leadin' the herd?
I'm leadin' heavy artillery right from the Judgement Day, nerds!
Tryin' to do this a better way.
But plagued by OCD - all I wanna have is breasts - bazonga.
I'm 'bout to do it with Jane Fonda.
But she's a whore.
Charlie Harper's mom.
All she wants is a piece of wood to slip between her thongs.
You think I'll let this offer pass by?
I ain't an idiot I'm crazy.
And that's the work of a Real Slim Shady.

Booyah! Outta nowhere.

Punks this ain't no freestyle battle.
Nigga please, can't stop us cause lost our brakes the last lap.
Welcome to the DC - rest as much - hope you had a nice flight.
Dawgs like us don't bite.
We love our homies and shoot the enemies as many times we like.
So you can run straight back home, bring a chainsaw.
\- all I have is a pocket knife.
Too much? You know what's in store right?
Set an example of enmity by fuckin' yo' whores all night.
No pay! It's yours, remember?
14 nights - 7 yours, 7 mine.
And we back to friends again, bye!

Runnin' from the 5-O like we comit a crime?
But we did nothin'.
People say vulgarity is offensive, they call it barbin'.
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me -.
No other way to diss our 'nemies.
Oh Bee.
This a disease.
A barbiturate could've given me more sleep -.
A smelly heap o' shit.
The ghetto stars been revolvin' around my head all the time.
It's time to pull the plug Mr. It'll All Be Fine.
Now I'm worried.
I can't see the future in Rap for me.
Can't give slangs? My gang's ready to kill me.
So put a barrier on 'em.
Urgh! I'm waiting for a MIRACLE.
Now I come forth to God.
It is Thee who can me.
Finished the prayer, confessed.
The cops came blastin'.
I's usin' the crucifix to scratch my tushie!
