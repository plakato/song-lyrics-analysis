_Dead__ Brain..._.
Fuck Peace! I'm brain-dead and I'm losin' control.
In my head am I brain dead.
Look at me now man brain dead.
Remember something's wrong with my brain, insane.
Retro Horror Music plus the brain dead; it causes tension.
Ten to the head, and now you're motherfuckin' brain dead.
Some say my brains dead Mockin' what I'm rockin' then your sayin' what insane.

Or I can blow your eardrums with my brain dead rap.
In a mind that's so sick they label him brain dead.
Mainly off gat, I'm goin' brain dead inside.
As I BUCK BUCK that nigga is straight brain dead.
