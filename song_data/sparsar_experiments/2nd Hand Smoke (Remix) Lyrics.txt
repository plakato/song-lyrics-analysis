2nd Hand Smoke (Remix) Lyrics
by Twiztid.

Jamie Madrox.
I represent the Eastside, no peace, fuck the police.
We tell you to increase the deceased at least.
A grown man tellin' you something that he believe.
Practice to deceive, no more tricks up my sleeve.
What the fuck bitch, chuck bitch, why you talkin' shit.
Better duck bitch before your dome get hit.
This shit is twisted, deeper than that old French braid.
Stickier than jam and jelly phased, kick it.

Monoxide.
Everybody else real talkin' bout somethin'.
What you thought you heard bitch, can it cause you're frontin'.
Dead wrong, dinner table conversations.
Leavin' you pistol whipped in the corner with abrasions.
Call it a contamination of mind state.
Sleep in a dream, hopin' it's gone when I awake.
Mama think I'm a play on play serial killer.
Fruit looped outta my mind like Godzilla.
We survive like caterpillars in cocoons and caskets.
Stretch the industry like elastic, so fantastic.
Like the Newport cigarette that I smoke.
Hit the motherfucker till I choke, I brag and boast.
About nothin', death, dyin' and ho's fuckin'.
So understand that he's sayin' somethin'.
Never be heard, I'm underground with the dirt and grime.
Smashin' heads be my reason for rhyme, I'm on time.
Like a motherfucker leavin' you hangin' in the forest.
Standin' in some comfortable shifts like Chuck Norris.

Remember what I told you, always believe.
You relieve on the Monoxide Child and wild.
Travel the world on nine cloud, screaming loud.

Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.
Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.

You phoney bitches wanna shut me down, pullin' plugs on the microphones.
Hatin' on the individual handle Mr. Bones.
Hope your speaker's eight ohms or they dead blown.
If they aren't, turn this motherfucker up and mash on.
As we blast off bitch ass niggas at fast rate.
Growin' at a fast pace, made my heart race.
Lookin' death in the face and I don't even shudder.
If my woman starts cheatin', motherfuck her.
Bitch I'm out for self, green weed, fame and wealth.
So take your hopes and dreams and put that shit back on the shelf.
Cause we rollin' in a ride far from stolen.
Cigarette lighters, power windows, wood grade motors.
And takin' curbs with ease, blowin' trees.
Lookin' Chinese, hopin' that the cops ain't tailin' me.
Tryin' to violate that glass house.
Nigga pass the blunt before you pass out.
Cause now it's on, pushin' hubcaps, patrollin' the hood so fuck that.
Heard the shit and this shit is all wack, plannin' the attack.
Cause we move when it's dark at night.
Believe the rumors cause they probably all right.
Outta sight like concealed weapons and drug trades.
Barricading your door for the raid, and in the shade.
Is a sawed off, double-barrelled pump.
Lookin' for motherfuckers who wanna jump.
Cause I got thirteen bullets in my pocket, I'm a mad man.
My trigger finger turnin' suckers to sand.

Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.
Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.

All distraught from head trauma, you can't even see the drama.
I get the persona from marijuana.
At night I lay stressed with no place to go.
All by my lonely, screamin' out fuck that show.
Cigarettes, blunt smoke, I love the smell.
Player hate me cause I smoke, burn in hell.
This shit ain't for everybody, I love to sever bodies.
So melancholy, suicide is just a folly and I'm out.

Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.
Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.

Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.
Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.

Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.
Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.

Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.
Free your mind.
Breathe it in, second hand smoke.
