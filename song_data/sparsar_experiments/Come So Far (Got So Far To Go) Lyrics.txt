Come So Far (Got So Far To Go) Lyrics
by Queen Latifah.

Hey old friend let's look back on the crazy clothes we wore.
Ain't it fun to look back and to see it's all been done before?
All those nights together are a special memory.
And I can't wait for tomorrow, just as long as you're dancing next to me.

Cause it's so clear, every year, we get stronger.
What's gone is gone, the past is the past.
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas cause.

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go.
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go.
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow.
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go.

Hey old friend together, side-by-side and year-by-year.
The road was filled with twists and turns, oh, but that's the road that got us.
here.
Let's move past the bad times, but before those memories fade.
Let's forgive but not forget and learn from the mistakes we made.

Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger.
So don't give up and don't say when.
And just get back on the road again cause.

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go.
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go.
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow.
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go.

Hey old friend come along for the ride.
There's plenty of room, so jump inside.
The highway's rocky every now and then.
But it's so much better than where I've been.

Just keep movin' at your own speed.
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need.
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on.
Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone.
We got so far to go!

Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger.
So shine that light, take my hand.
Let's dance into the promise land cause.

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go.
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go.
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow.
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go.
But baby, baby we've got so far to go.

Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go.
Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go.
Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go.
Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go.
Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go.
Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby we've got so far to go....
