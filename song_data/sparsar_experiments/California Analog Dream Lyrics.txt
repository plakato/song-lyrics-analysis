California Analog Dream Lyrics
by Vondelpark.

As I am blind you know that I fit.
And watch as you burn.
And watch when you play.
Out of this town, then I'm gone.
But I fade.

Now my minds out.
My minds out of touch.

I passed her on my way out.

And I saw her on my way out.
And I passed her hair as I climb out.
