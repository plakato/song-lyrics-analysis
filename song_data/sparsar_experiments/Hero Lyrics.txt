Hero Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

I got everything a girl could ever want.
And baby boy, I found it in you.
If I hand my heart to you.
I know that it won't come back to me.
Battered and bruised.
And I gotta tell the truth.

Cause every day and night.
I'm a be right by your side.
? You this was forever.

From everything in you.
Baby, it's true.
It's only you that makes me better.
I got my hero.

I wanna thank you in advance for a beautiful life.
And tell you how happy I am.
Just to be your wife.
You're my rock.
You know you're my confidence.

Got that S on your chest.
Because you're my superman.
My hero.
You're my hero.
My hero.
You're my hero.

From the beginning.
I gave my heart to you.
And you've given your heart to me.
And without a doubt.
We locked them up together.
And we threw away the key.

Cause every day and night.
I'm a be right by your side.
? You this was forever.

From everything in you.
Baby, it's true.
It's only you that makes me better.
I got my hero.

I wanna thank you in advance for a beautiful life.
And tell you how happy I am.
Just to be your wife.
You're my rock.
You know you're my confidence.

Got that S on your chest.
Because you're my superman.
My hero.
You're my hero.
My hero.
You're my hero.

You thought our love would be your kryptonite.
And now you realize.
It's the only thing that makes you fly.
It's happily ever after.
Like a fairytale's end chapter.
This is how I show my gratitude to my superman.

Cause every day and night.
I'm a be right by your side.
? You this was forever.

From everything in you.
Baby, it's true.
It's only you that makes me better.
I got my hero.

I wanna thank you in advance for a beautiful life.
And tell you how happy I am.
Just to be your wife.
You're my rock.
You know you're my confidence.

Got that S on your chest.
Because you're my superman.
My hero.
You're my hero.
My hero.
You're my hero.
