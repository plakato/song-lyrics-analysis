Numb Lyrics
by Yung Chibi.


I'm so cold.
My lungs are so cold.
I'm tired of being good, always do what I'm told.
I'll kill you and you can kill me.
Maybe if we're dead we can be happy.
Our love is like a rose in a bush full of thorns.
It makes me feel new and it makes me feel warm.
But sometimes I cry and I know how to feel.
So I cut off all the petals to watch them all wilt.

Get me while I'm feeling numb.
I see you, I feel you.
Kill me while I'm feeling numb.
I see you, I'll miss you.
