Break Ya Neck (Freestyle Lyrics
by Wrekonize.


Ring the bell ring the bell better get alarmed.
Need a second to get better with a leather palm.
Showing up to your job with a letter bomb.
Anthrax in the center of the pentagon.
In it with a bit of the bang bang.
Get 'em up and get 'em all a critical mainframe.
Limited to litigate a cynical lame brain.
Ignorant vein vein, typical shame shame.
This here's a warning shot, to all those acting funny.
I'm loading up to get respect and Apple Patent money.
This here's the final five.
But I need to get a liver vibe.
Meet me in the middle with the iodine.
I think it's 'bout to time that I die for mine.
How 'bout your needs? I thirst for more heat.
Dropping shit that'll make 'em all really wanna.
Stop -- drop, and roll.
I got them tour needs, bring the liquor please.
I live a life that is really quite nice full of.
Rock -- and, roll.
This game is pure greed, big racks and more sleaze.
But it's all in the good name of.
Hip-hop -- and, soul.
So let them whores breed, who needs the sword cleaned?
Ben has got a better bit of bangers that'll put your Betty.
Back down on her hands and knees.
Please emcees, if you need to breathe free.
Then do not challenge me, we agree? Please leave.

My next album is set to make Mitt Romney pro-abortion.
Cause kids can't compete, when the Brit spits on the beats.
With the verbs and with the speech, I been bred to rep the Heat.

And them last bars were weak, that's just how they sound to me.
Get a trip down to Miami come and get a humid reply.
The drinks are doubles and if troubled well then you just might die.
Get your hustle put 'em in a muzzle we been loving the sky.
Wanna give another public supply, of what you been fucking denied.

I'm an 8-3 king with a HD thing.
Enemies who hate me you know I don't stop....
But I keep and I keep on going in.
Get it banging all up in the bigger lower end.
Get another from the brother with the solar pen.
That good 'ol bottom rock....
