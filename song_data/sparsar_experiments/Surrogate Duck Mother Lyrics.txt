Surrogate Duck Mother Lyrics
by Rushad Eggleston.

Surrogate duck mother.
You'll be keeping me warm every night.

Surrogate wildebeast mother.
You'll be keeping me warm every night.

Sadly false brontosaurus.
You'll always exist in my heart.

Soon I'll be living on Neptune.
Cuz this world's just too crowded for me.

I heard what they said about pluto.
But it'll always be my number nine.
