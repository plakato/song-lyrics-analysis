Not love or death Lyrics
by The Rural Alberta Advantage.

Nothing's gonna tear you away from me.
Not love or death.
No, Nothing's gonna hold you back to me.
No - not I.
She want a candle.
Fire's gonna burn you back to me.
In envy and I.
We've been running hard.
The body's been stopped.
Going out awhile - not I.
Why'd she want a candle - not I.
Got you in the end.
Oh we're on fire - love.
There's nothing bringing you problems.
We're just lying here - love.
There's nothing saving this house.
Fire's gonna burn you back to me.
In envy and I.
We've been fighting hard.
The embers been gone.
Going out a while - fought I.
Love is with them - oh, not I.
Let's burn it to the end.
Oh we're on fire.
There's nothing bringing you harm.
We're just lying here.
Oh, there's nothing saving this house.
