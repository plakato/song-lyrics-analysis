Fuck Your Face Lyrics
by V-Nasty.

I'm sittin' on a cloud that don't move.
Fuck yo face.
I'm too high.
Fuck yo face.
Your weed not on, no thanks.

Purple O.G.?
I love that taste.
Where the backwood at?
Go roll that eighth.

Wait!
Can't stand up.
How I'mma roll up?
Matter fact, give me that back.
I'mma roll that up.
Light it up, and get high as fuck.

This personal, boy, roll your own.
I grow my own shit.
Got a hundred clones.
Oh, you mad?
Better watch your tone.

Ran outta backwoods, so I grabbed a bone.
THC, trippy stick.
When I blow my weed.
There's an extra lift.
Gas mask.
Well that's the shit.
That eighth gone, so we get a zip.

In this club.
Give it to a bad bitch.

Rub a, rub a dub dub.

Inhale, exhale.
Police say probable cause for that weed smell.
I roll the best shit, upscale.
I blew a whole zip.
Light another L.

Only time could tell.
How high I'm gonna get.
Who will ever know?
If a blunt stay lit.
Its burnin' too slow.
Activist dip.

Smoke leaving the room.
Let's hot box the whip!
I'm out of my mind.
I'm seein' thangs.
I be so high.
I hallucinate.

I had to go to sleep.
To re-cooperate.
Wake up and eat.
To re-instate.

Fuck, I'm high, cuz.
Put the weed out.
Can't hit that shit anymore.
Let me out of this room.
The fuck is wrong with me?
Please no more weed.

Can't take it.

In this club.
Give it to a bad bitch.

Rub a, rub a dub dub.
