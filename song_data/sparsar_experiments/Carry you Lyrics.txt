Carry you Lyrics
by Union J.

Don't ever say your lonely.
Just lay your problems on me.
And i'll be waiting there for you.
The stars can be so blinding.
When you get tired of fighting.
You know the one you can look to.

When the vision you have gets blurry.
You don't have to worry, i'll be you eyes.
It's the least i can cause when i fell.
You pulled me through.
So you know that.

I'll carry you, i'll carry you, i'll carry you.
So you know that.
I'll carry you, i'll carry you, i'll carry you.

I know its been a long night but now I'm here it's alright.
I don't mind walking in your shoes.
We'll take each step together, til you come back to center.
You know that i know the real you.

And when the vision you have gets blurry.
You don't have to worry i'll be your eyes.
That's the least i can cause when i fell.
You pulled me through.
So you know that.

I'll carry you, i'll carry you, i'll carry you.
Sod you know that.
I'll carry you, i'll carry you, i'll carry you.

Like you've been running for hours and can't catch your breath.
The demons are screaming so loud in your head.
Your tired you're broken you're cut and you're bruised.
But nothings to heavy just hold on, i'll carry you.

I'll carry you.

Instrumental.

So you know that.

I'll carry you, i'll carry you, i'll carry you.
So you know that.
I'll carry you, i'll carry you, i'll carry you.
So you know that.
I'll carry you, i'll carry you, i'll carry you.
