Wah Gwan Lyrics
by Wordsplayed.


Gawvi blew the speaker, yeah.
Gawvi blew the speaker.

Westside with Carlos ain't never seen East Carlow.
He hit the switch in that Carlo.
Then filled the swisher with narco.
Eyes up on that crucifix, Woodgrain I'm gon' grip.
Jim Jones, 78.
Purple drink they gon' sip.
That's H-town if you ain't know.
My Uptown, they still low.
It's all praise to the most High.
Please give a hand for the new guy.
That trap house with sold D's, Let's burn that like Left Eye.
Wack rappers got no steez, cookie cutter still gon' try.
Mobbin with the squadron, boards was all out on Lebrayo.
With that outdoor smell like indo, and I got my eyes on Taylor.
Thought we did this for the money?
Ya'll was way off.
I spent my winnings Uptown, we was way North.
I think all they hope gone.

She said that she let her get two on.
Cocaina in the hall, papi said they gonna ball.
Alcohol, adderall.
Pass out in the dirty stall, Lord.

Wah gwan? Call the selector.
They beez in the trap, they want.
the nectar.
You can get it for the low, shouts to Hector.
She try and drop it to the floor, I ain't let her.
Wah gwan? Call the selector.
They beez in the trap, they want.
the nectar.
You can get it for the low, shouts to Hector.
She try and drop it to the floor, I ain't let her.

Ridin' around with that beater.
With that beater.
With that beater.
We know who it is man, who can defeat it?
Ridin' around with that beater.
With that beater.
With that beater.
We know who with us, man who could defeat us?

I smoke that THC, they lookin'.
DOA.
In Californ-I-A, no love for CHP.
Man, I was like Wah Gwan? and they was like Wassup?
You know we out here dun, it's time to wake ya'll up.

Wah gwan?
Call the selector.
They beez in the trap, they want.
the nectar.
You can get it for the low, shouts to Hector.
She try and drop it to the floor, I ain't let her.
Wah Gwan? Call the selector.
They beez in the trap, they want.
the nectar.
You can get it for the low, shouts to Hector.
She try and drop it to the floor, I ain't let her.
