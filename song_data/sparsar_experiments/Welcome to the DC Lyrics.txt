Welcome to the DC Lyrics
by Wonderstarz.


Crazy ... Wonderstarz ..., Hah, 
 
I'm, a crazy anti-racist, feminist, narcissist, 
Deliver, tough lyrics to me, 
Imma be # bitchplease 
Takin' orders from no one, I'm Edward Teach, 
These motherfuckers, don't know. What'S cookin' in my lab, 
The experimental rappers grab. 
You can grab my crotch and suck it haters 
Yeah, it's fab 
Call me daisies, but I'm blessin' this world 
By stayin' in it 
It's nothin', definitive 
By the time I end this rhyme. This whole world'll be finished, 
, 
Annihilation o' mah enemies, 
True nigga-, buyin', dope, shit with real Gs, 
Others agree, 
I'll burn ya, ass to 666 degrees, 
I got expertise- the motherfuckin' rap Hercules, 
Too, sick and tired of my foes idiosyncrasies 
I'm takin' steps. So this problems don't persist. 
This is a permanent diss-. The Devil's Lube applied 
On your ma before processes with the delivery tube 
 
Okay ... Wait for it, 
Ah Fuck, it miracles, don't happen easily 
That measly greasily bitch
