Blood From the Roots of the Forest
by Xasthur.

Elizabeth christened, no paler a rose.
Grew so dark as this sylph.
None more cold in repose.
Yet Her beauty spun webs.
Round hearts a glance would betroth.

She feared the light.
So when She fell like a sinner to vice.
Under austere, puritanical rule.
She sacrificed....
Mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall.
But after whipangels licked prisoners, thralled.
Never were Her dreams so maniacally cruel.

For ravens winged Her nightly flights.
Of erotica.
Half spurned from the pulpit.
Torments to occur.
Half learnt from the cabal of demons.
In Her.
Her walk went to voodoo.
To see Her own shadow adored.
At mass without flaw.
Though inwards She abhored.
Not Her coven of suitors.
But the stare of their Lord!
