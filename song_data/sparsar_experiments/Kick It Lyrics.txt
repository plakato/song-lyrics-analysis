Kick It Lyrics
by Yung Massina.


Kick it with a young boss, baby we can get lost.
Let that top back on my ride, baby when you ready let's vibe.
And we gon kick it.
Girl let's go kick it.
Like how I kick it.
You wanna kick it?

Bitch come kick the shit with a fat boss bitch and hop inside of this drop top.
We can smoke some weed and we can pop some pills and we can pig out at IHOP.
I took your bitch to Saks Fifth, I bought the bitch all kinds of gifts.
I mean Versace this, bitch and Gucci that, nigga Prada and Fendi bags.
Used to fucking them have nots, now you fuck with me and I have a lot.
I got so many motherfucking whips 'til the shit look like a car lot.
She say she love the way that I handle business.
I got 12 years in this shit, that's 12 years worth of pimping bitch.
Your last nigga he kick rocks.
And I rock and roll bitch call me the black version of Kid Rock, minus the.
guitar.
If I see a bitch and I want her ass, you best believe I'ma go get her.
Nigga 5 minutes worth of spit game.

I meant to say I dick her down.
That pussy so damn wet, feel like my dick got on a clear coat.
That pussy was so hairy 'til it looked like a Billy Goat.
That ass like two cantaloupes and I eat that pussy like a crocodile.
And now all she wanna do is -.

If you ask me for a dollar, baby you can have two.
If you want some red bottoms, I'll make you a baboon.
I don't wanna stall but let's take it to the bathroom.
Give you brain and all, shawty welcome to my classroom.

Niggas want cocaine, I bring them cookies over like new neighbors.
Fucking with my game, you need two controllers, I'm too player.
No plain hoes, I'm too major, I need some bitches that's gorgeous.
You are one and you are too so get on top of this joystick.
They say boy quit, I say smoke this then I hand them hoes a blunt.
And now they got them legs separated like Avant.
In my bed doing stunts, eating pussy, tooting ass up.
Let â€˜em know they can split the pole without bad luck.
Girl this ain't no alley oop so you shouldn't pass up.
Cutting, fucking up her head, man I got her gashed up.
Homie got her gassed up, taking her to Shell.
I just keep it short and sweet like Miguel.
If you with it, come and kick it.

Kick it with a boss, see the way I floss.
Girl you wanna ball? We can kick it.
Like the way I walk? Like the way I talk?
Like a soccer ball we can kick it.
Yeah, Girl, Girl, Yeah, Yeah.
