Drown Out Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

Drown out.
The voice that breaks the silence.
And talks the joy out of everything.
You were found out and had to walk.
In darkness without the only thing you care about.

And we drive away and head for south.
We found our way and blocked it out.

Cry alone, and die alone.
Pray alone, and stay alone.

You were burned out.
And had to stop before all hell broke.
And finally took its toll.

And save our souls were playing dead.
And mine for gold in a heart of lead.
And turn around and save yourself.
We found our way and blocked it out.

Cry alone, and die alone.
Pray alone, and stay alone.

Drown out.
