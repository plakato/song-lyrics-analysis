Carpe Diem (feat. A Glorious Anthem) Lyrics
by Wonder Bred.

:.

Yeah I'm Alive.
Oh I'm Alive.
I'm High off life.
And I'm Alive.
X3.

I sit to eat and rap.
Truthfully I need a nap.
You will see my speech is green as grass.
Here's a key so you can read the map.

Messing around, a mess has been found, It's my room!
Just Joking don't mess with this clown.
I've met an amount of decadent nouns.
I don't invent in the sound to get an account.
With 0's like Tic Tac Toe so I'm X'ing it out.

I'm boiling tortellini.
For a meal that's sorta meaty.
Cheddar is orange and cheesy.
I usually use more than one seasoning.
I'd rather my room and board be cheap than be bored in a meeting.
With a four piece suit for dry cleaning.
I wear tie dye, expressing my freedom.
People are more than appearance and speaking.
We are unique which equals equivalent.
I stick in this quest for higher meaning.

Hopefully my vocals can open some folks to see.
Metaphors I metamorphosize and it's so Lowkey.
This goes to those who don't eat:.
Anorexic or starving is hectic.
Those from privilege simply don't get it.

It's offensive to suggest that homosexuals.
Choose like a vegetarian eats only vegetables.

Let go of your fears, let go of your pain.
Let go of your ego let go of your vain.
Let go of your evil let go of your blame.
Embrace all these people shake off all your shame.
Each of you're pieces in making a change.
Let go of your defense quit playing the game.
Unclothe your uniqueness they say be the same.
Sew seeds with your speaking see we Seize the Day.

Yeah, I'm alive.
And I can fly.

You can't touch me cause I can Fly. x2.

Reminiscing I'm thinking of those days.
This intimate friendship is both ways.
If it's simply to witness that's okay.
Sprint into experience, don't wait.

The King of all Asanas, watch me just stand.
Upside down on my head with my neck in my hands.
It's you will or you won't, don't say that you can't.
Props to the Pope opposing popular plans.
He's in the streets with the beggars and speaks to the damned.
What can the pretentious just not understand?

Republicans, Democrats:.
Blue or red flaggin it.
Let go competitiveness and all that attachment.
As you mess around and fuss, down, you're dragging us.
Speaking of being equal with freedom, how do you back it up?
Vagabonds actually just want to SuperPac a fund.

Here's how nowadays: USA- Unconstitutionally Screws All who founded us.
Will we repeat? Bush Drops Bunches of Bombs versus a Clinton Who's Down.
To Fuck.
