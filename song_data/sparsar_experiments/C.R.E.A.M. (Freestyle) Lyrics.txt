C.R.E.A.M. (Freestyle) Lyrics
by Akala.

Who wanna be broke? Nobody, that's a joke.
That's why coats get blood soaked for pound notes.
That's most of the reason niggas bleeding from gun smoke.
It's all of the reason that a twelve year old sell coke.
That's why mum's stressed out, that's why niggas stretched out.
If you stackin' cake, we'll break in your house, tape up your mouth.
Take the spouse, where's the cash?
Give me the work or the cash, or you gettin' clapped.
You can be the king of the track, or rap, niggas is rash.
Long as you black you can get jacked, that is a fact.
I never really been rich but I know one thing that won't change.
Never let a man that bleed the same take my chain.
I feel raped, I buss it, fuck it.
I couldn't rest knowing the man took what's mine and I did nothing.
How I run it, I done stuck a few in my days.
But I'm still here so fuck it, party away.
Get paid, get laid, get a house with a maid.
Give back to those that was raised how you was raised.
Whoever said life ain't about stackin' paper?
They a fuckin' idiot, and they need to wake up.
