Shakespeare Lyrics
by Akala.

Nigga, listen 
When, I spit on the riddem. I kill em 
Raw like the Ball of Brazilians 
You. Don'T want war cor, the kids, brilliant 
Blood im, the heir to the throne 
Not, William Akala smart as King
Arthur 
Darker, harder, faster 
Rasclaat. I kick the Illa shit 
It's like Shakespeare, with a nigga twist 
Lyricist im the best on the road 
Nitro flow oh-so-cold I'mma blow yo 
Keep, the hoes. I only want dough homes, 
Nobody close, I'm alone in my own zone. 
No. No love for the po-po 

I hope that you know where you don't go. Thoe 
Want it with Bolo Must be coco 
Its, William back from the dead 
But. I rap bout, gats and I'm black. Instead 
It's Shakespeare, reincarnated 
Except. I spit flows and strip hoes naked 
No. Fakin'-Test my blood bruv 
Its, William back as a tug cuz 
So real the shit. I kick now 
Plus. I don't write. I recite my shit now 
Straight from the top expert timin' 
On top of that now the whole things rhymin' 
No, more tights, now jeans, saggin' 
If. I say so myself, I'm much more handsome 
Don't ever compare me to rappers 
I'm, so quick-witted that I split em like fractions 
My shit. I tell em like this 
It's like Shakespeare, with a nigga twist 
 
I get you pumped up 
Feelin' like you drunk drunk 
When. My beats bump bump 
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now 
All the shit. I kick so crazy, 
There ain't, no ifs and maybe's 
Spit poetry, so shady 
For lords on road and my hood. Ladies 
Pumped up feelin', like you drunk drunk 
When, my beats bump bump 
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now 
All the shit. I kick so crazy, 
There ain't, no ifs and maybe's 
Spit poetry, so shady 
For lords on road and my hood ladies 
 
I'm, similar to William but a little different 
I. Do it for kids. That'S illiterate, not Elizabeth 
Stuck on the road faces, screwed up 
Feel like the world, spat em out and they 
Chewed up 
It's a matrix. I try and explain it 
But on a real thoe, still ready blaze. Em 
No contradiction just face it 
They, so enslaved they are worse than a agent 
I. Grace stages sharp as razors 
Don't get cut, cuz keep ya distance, 
No artillery tryna' be militant 
Ya'll. Dudes killin' me think that ya killin' it 
Its, embarrassing watchin you babblin, 
Keep, spittin ya, darts mine is javelins 
The hood Tiger Woods too milly 
Number 1 for so long. Its just getting' silly 
Shit kinda, like Bruce wit da knuckles 
Like. The first time ya ever saw Ali shuffle 
You, don't trouble left layin in a puddle 
Bruv. You are havin a bubble. 
Ima whole different kettle of fish 
Thou shall not fuck with dis 
My shit. I tell em, like this 
Its like Shakespeare, with a nigga tiwst 
 
I get you pumped up 
Feelin' like you drunk drunk 
When, my beats bump bump 
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now 
All the shit. I kick so crazy, 
There ain't, no ifs and maybe's 
Spit poetry, so shady 
For lords on road and my hood. Ladies 
Pumped up feelin' like you drunk drunk 
When, my beats bump bump 
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now 
All the shit. I kick so crazy. 
There ain't, no ifs and maybe's 
Spit poetry, so shady 
For lords on road and my hood. Ladies 
 
To be fair. No MC close to the man 
Little just come: yout's jumpin out of they pram 
Everybody badman behind a mic stand: 
Its, not creative one bag of hype and 
If. You buss a ting where's, the mash 
Move, so much food Where's, the cats 
These dudes ain't real. They just rap 
I, don't spit what I don't know: 
Just the facts. 
No talks of rocks, I ain't sold 
Shots. I ain't blown 
My business, ridiculous 
Sick with it quick, witted 
Companies head to head an liquidate. It 
Welcome to illa state, meet ya, fate
mate 
Talk truth, but we don't play games, 
Move, sick, look sample, techno 
Never, pull a ting if it ain't gon na. Let go 
That's that rap track. 
Clap ya, like a black gat 
Back chat, crack back 
I'm the nigga. That'S that 
The rest of these kids is irrelevant. 
Don'T. Compare me to him. 
That'S, just beggin'. It 
Im on my own shit, 
Dicks ain't spit 
Its, no democracy, dictatorship, 
So, dicks hate, my shit, 
Im sick, raise ya, spliff, 
Im, swift, blaze, em, quick, 
My hits major shit. 
I flip phrases, quick, 
My, sick razor shit, 
Give, thick grazes, quick, 
And, chicks, say he's cris 
It's, not a rumour, 
That kid Akala 
No, not Ack-a-la, beg ya. Pardon 
Don't get it twisted 
Your on the sideline, like a mistress, 
I'm, the whizzkid with the sick shit 
My shit. I tell em like this 
It's like Shakespeare, with a nigga twist
