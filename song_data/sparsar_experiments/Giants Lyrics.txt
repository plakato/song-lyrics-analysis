Giants Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


When you're lost in the world.
And you're wondering what you want.
Say oh, a little bit of everything.

Find a house, find a girl.
Settle down, but it ain't enough.
Cause oh, you want a little bit of everything.
Said oh, a little bit of everything.

Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.

We could be giants.
The last of the hometown heroes.
The last of the hometown heroes.
Bigger than giants.
Tonight we are moving mountains.
Bigger than giants.

When you're hanging by a thread.
And your hopes and dreams unravel.
Think I know, I'm giving upon everything.

Take a look, take a look at your life.
And maybe then you'll see.
Baby, ohhh, they can't take away anything.
Should've known they can't take away everything.

Ohhhhhhh.
Ohhhhhhh, whoa oh, whoa oh.

We could be giants.
The last of the hometown heroes.
The last of the hometown heroes.
Yeah, bigger than giants.
Tonight we're moving mountains.
Bigger than giants.

Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.

Bigger than giants.
We're bigger than giants.
