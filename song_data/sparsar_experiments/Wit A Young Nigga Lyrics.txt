Wit A Young Nigga Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


What it is right now, What it is right now.
What it is right now, What it is right now.

Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.

Bounce, Rock, Roll a J,.
All the problems of my days gettin' blown away.
I was tryin' to call the homie but my phone delay.
And when that nigga finally answers tell him andale.
Tell him hurry cuz I'm outside,.
He be trippin', He ain't tryin' to take his own ride.
Tryin' to make to the beach for the low tide.
And we was calling' up some freaks when his phone died.
I mobbing through the city when the sun's out.
I be screaming' westside til' my lungs out.
Got plans so I had to pull the funds out.
Eyes peeled when I'm lookin' for the one's out.
Only day one's niggas in my little Civic.
Remember rollin' in the bucket with blinker missin'.
Had to open the door on the other side.
I ain't no gentlemen, thats how a nigga get inside.

What it is right now, What it is right now.
What it is right now, What it is right now.

Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.

Yo, you a slave to the bullshit.
On my grind put in work like a full shift.
Catch me mackin' on a bunny with a full lip.
I'm in ya kitchen cooking pizza with a full stiff.
I know, i know, I know, I'm stupid, that some old shit.
Make my city bump my music, that's some goal shit.
And I ain't clickin' wit these niggas, that's some hoe shit.
Every nigga for they self, on some grown shit.
I tell her gone bitch, drop, drop, Hold that moment like a Kodak.
Every time she thinks of me she wishes she could go back.
I don't do no hoe rap, She got you on low-jack.
You claimin' you the shit but how come we ain't ever know that.
I'm the captain of my vessel and the crew of my boat.
And we 'bout to be the wave, you just stayin' afloat.
And the bitches be on gram with these Marilyn quotes.
And all my niggas thinkin 'bout is if you sparing the throat.
Man, Fuck your side, we building' our own land.
With a million dollar deal and a master plan.
And I ain't fuckin' with nobody if they don't understand.
That when you talk money gotta have the cash in hand.

What it is right now, What it is right now.
What it is right now, What it is right now.

Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.

Watch a young nigga spaz when I spit it.
It's a lot of niggas that will never get a chance.
They would kill for my position.
That's why Im pushin harder and appreciate my peers.
Cuz I know that me and them got the same old fears.
Not bein' remembered.
That's the shit that keep me up.
I'd be dead the next day saw the sun come up.
And I know my body needin' a rest.
But its another nigga still goin' in, how can I do less?
I'm a monster with this rap shit bruh.
On my toes and I'm ready for that action bruh.
And if a nigga start trippin, got mean 16.
To show a nigga what its like to actually taste his dream.
I be 'bout my cream, So don't play, Theres a lot on my plate.
Niggas cuttin' red meat we gotta a lot up at stake.
Bunch of niggas thrown' dirt, I gotta swallow the hate.
And let it rumble til' I get to throw it all in your face.
Boy.

What it is right now, What it is right now.
What it is right now, What it is right now.

Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
Is you fuckin' wit a young nigga.
