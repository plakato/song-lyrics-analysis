Criminals Lyrics
by Annie Mell Monroe.

So come between me and my future and you're absurd.
Set a record better flip the yellow page.
And I am never going to hold my tongue for shit.
So please shut the fuck up, get off my dick.
So yeah I got purp haze and I got cream.
Wishing for a day I'm finding bigger checks.
Liberating every single note been ever caged.
Chill motherfucker.

The ladies on the streets know I'm trill motherfucker.
Color the canvas in my mind with beautiful pictures.
Got a blunt and a label and I'm taking lead.
last name.
Perez said Get them so I got them.
Everybody on the street who knows me wants to fuck me so they can all have my.
Don't want to stay here so I'm flying off.
With Luanne by my side sitting in the first class.
Criminals; they say that's who we are.
Can not handle half of me.

Who dropped a new beat nigga that's mine.

We get shot on the block just for spitting some rhymes.
So judge me for being who I want to be.
And I'm doing me while you sit on your ass.
And I blow dank.
Goddamn.
Land in New York, drink syrup get throwed.
And I work for the money, get bills motherfucker.
Cause I don't talk shit.

And drugs have a way to evoke a new feeling.

I'm the biggest motherfucker since Pharrell to hit the page.
Dressing the haze in a french cigar.
Put me on a stage I re position all my rage.

Right from Manhattan, dressed in Supreme.

Call my dudes up, but I'm moving kind of slow.

Phisycs is phisycs but fuck gravity.


Nigga, words really do have a meaning.
Hip hop is dead but I'm real motherfucker.
And I spit fresh.
And now I got steeze and they're all aplauding.
And it's no problem how I rock that stage.
