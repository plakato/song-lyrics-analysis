Communication Lost Lyrics
by Wolverine.

How many times do we have to end up here?
It's all but a secret, we're slowly tearing ourselves apart.
I'm so tired of everything that's going on.
Wish I could turn back time and return to our innocence.
Constantly raping the boundaries we have set.
It's each to his own in a battle of egos we've fought for so long.
Seems there is no way out of this.
We'll die to stand our ground.
I do remember that there was a dream.
Innocence united us, we grew stronger.
I've cried a thousand times in despair of what we are.
Reduced to slaves in the world of the silent no.
I've tried a thousand times to believe in what we were.
All I find is a communication lost.
All I want for us is to get along, return that innocence again.
All that we were to be what we are.
We have wasted too much time, that fight ain't worth the price.
By now we've lost enough, lets' bring this to an end…
How do we end this, escape the battlegrounds?
We've fought in this war for so long, did we forget how to forgive?
All of the answers linger in shadows unknown.
But with our last ounce of strength we need to ask…
I do remember that there was a dream.
Innocence united us, we grew stronger.
I've cried a thousand times in despair of what we are.
Reduced to slaves in the world of the silent no.
I've tried a thousand times to believe in what we were.
I lost my faith, told myself you could never know.
I've cried a thousand times in despair of what we are.
Immersed in tears, I drown in its silent flow.
I've tried a thousand times to believe in what we were.
All I find is a communication lost.
