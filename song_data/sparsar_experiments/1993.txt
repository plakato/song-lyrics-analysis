Peace God.
I did shows for ten people now theres many more.
I felt like lebron on an empty court.
Did you see that last dunk? Could you bend the boards?
Now I shock whole crowds like extension cords.
Hip hop hooorayyy.
Ohhhhh ayyyyee.
Something light.
Did you see that last dunk? Could you bend the boards?
Now I shock whole crowds like extension cords.
A lot of dudes ball hog but they never score.
I break beats like a criminal with any law.
I need a rap bitch like pap did with Remy Ma.
I need plaques so my alias is dental floss.
All my beats take a violence prevention course.
I kill microphones I just grab they neck and choke.
I'm very broke walking like I'm winning any war.
With pennies on pinching pennies I could get awards.
I'm on the road and I'm driven like I'm henry ford.
You can be very rich while you semi poor.
Just appreciate the years and hope for many more.
Cause some people that you love won't be anymore.

CUTS TO 12 YEAR OLD AZIZ.
Ya game is soft.
You make rappin soft.
I'm so persuasive, I can make cats like dogs.
Get out my face, I don't care how you do it.
You as soft as wearin socks and steppin on cow maneur.
How you gon front when you know I got some radical text.
I make Chinese speak English.
I Make Spanish speak French.
I'm dangerous, put you in peril so stay chill.
Make rappers look bad.
Kids with ADHD stay still.
