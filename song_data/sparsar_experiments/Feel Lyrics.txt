Feel Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

I gave you everything all I could give.
It might not have been the life you thought you'd live.
I know it feels good to have you by my side.
Even though I know you could just break my heart wide.

I just have to ask you, one more time....

Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I help you see like stars and the sun?
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you feel like life's just begun?

Its like a puzzle, a piece that just fit.
You never really needed to look for it.
In your eyes I see my future and my past.
I never really thought that we would last.

I just have to ask you, one more time....

Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I help you see like stars and the sun?
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you feel like life's just begun?

We have seen all the good times and the bad.
Waitin' for the next part we never had.
To the highest mountain, yeah, I would climb.
I just have to ask you, one more time.

Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you see like stars and the sun?
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you feel like life's just begun?
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I help you see like stars and the sun?
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you feel like life's just begun?
