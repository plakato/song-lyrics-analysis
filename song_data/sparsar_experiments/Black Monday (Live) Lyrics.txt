Black Monday (Live) Lyrics
by The Union.

Sing it loud, sing it sweet.
With hellfire fury, stomping your feet.
If fortune leaves you in a bar downtown.
Take your self-pity and drink it down.
Cuervo's revenge on a sunny day.
My eyes are red, skin is grey.
There was a time when it wasn't this way.
Just the glass, the bottle and me.
She was a dancer with expensive taste.
I played the markets 'til Black Monday.
She took the rest and ever since that day.
It's the glass, the bottle and me.
So sing it loud, sing it sweet.
With hellfire fury, stomping your feet.
If fortune leaves you in a bar downtown.
Take your self-pity and drink it down.
Tired of do-gooders trying to make me change.
Saying mend your ways before you lose your friends.
I tell them over and over again.
It's the glass, the bottle and me.
Sing it loud, sing it sweet.
With hellfire fury, stomping your feet.
If fortune leaves you in a bar downtown.
Take your self-pity and drink it down.
Standing here on the edge of self-destruction.
Biding my time.
Waiting for Lady Luck to call my name.
And drag me away.

Cuervo's revenge on a sunny day.
My eyes are red, skin is grey.
There was a time when it wasn't this way.
Just the glass, the bottle and me.
Sing it loud, sing it sweet.
With hellfire fury, stomping your feet.
If fortune leaves you in a bar downtown.
Take your self-pity and drink it down.
Drink it all down.
Take your self-pity.
And drink it down.
