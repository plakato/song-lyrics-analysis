Across the Alley From the Alamo Lyrics
by Quebe Sisters.


Across the alley from the Alamo.
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo.
Who sang a sort of indian.
Hi-de-ho to the people passing by.
The pinto spent his time a swishin' flies.
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies.
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes.
On the people passing by.
One day they went awalkin'.
Along the railroad track.
They were swishin', not lookin'.
Toot, toot, they never came back.
Across the alley from the Alamo.
When the summer sun decides to settle low.
A fly sings an Indian hi-de-ho.
To the people passing by.

Across the alley from the Alamo.
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo.
Who used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough.
For the people passing by.
They thought that they would make some easy bucks.
If they're washin' their frijoles in Duz and Lux.
A pair of very conscientious clucks.
To the people passing by.
Then they took this cheap vacation.
Their shoes were polished bright.
No they never heard the whistle.
Toot, toot, they're clear out of sight.
Across the alley from the Alamo.
When the starlight beams it's tender tender glow.
The beans go to sleep and there ain't no dough.
For the people passing by.

One day they went awalkin'.
Along the railroad track.
They were swishin', not lookin'.
Toot, toot, they never came back.
Oh, across the alley from the Alamo.
When the summer sun decides to settle low.
A fly sings an Indian hi-de-ho.
To the people passing by.
Across the alley from the Alamo.
