Feel It In My Bones Lyrics
by 4th Pyramid.


I'm so hip hop my hip popped.
Shattered into pieces when I hit it on the block.
Bum with a broken arm holding out his hand.
Froze in the middle lane hoping I could Stand.
Eyes poking out the van.
Sprawled on the road like beans pouring out a can.
Steel on my hip &amp; not the gun type.
It's like life done changed in a sneeze Gezunteit.
Bless you..IVs and the test tube.
Shitty magazines waiting rooms is stressed too.
Miss Farag what happened listen.
Your son Adam crashed Now at the fracture clinic.
Imagine this shit Now im sitting here a bastard tripping.
Wishing I ain't have to ask to piss and.
Life's fast I'm missing lights cash &amp; women.

I can feel it in my bones people all around me.
But Im really on my own.
I can feel it my bones.
On my last breath but I'm reaching for the gold.
I can feel it in my bones people all around me.
But Im really on my own.
I can feel it my bones.
On my last breath but I'm reaching for the gold.

City slicker running where the stakes is high.
Trying to earn 7 figures for the day I die.
But I'm laying in a bed whose trying break my stride.
Doc said you can't walk still I aim to fly.
Soâ€¦people asking me what's happening.
I hit the stage 2 days after my accident.
Up in a wheelchair how the Fuck you think it feel here.
But at the end of the day still got the rent to pay.
I'm hurting broke hip now that's a burden.
Low chips no Crys so its bourbon.
Hope drifts but know this yo I'm certain.
Behind stress tides &amp; currents success mine is lurking.
Feeling like Richard Pryor dripped on fire.
Like my maker went ahead &amp; just clipped a wire.
Sit aspire recollect &amp; live inspired.
Like I thought I had it bad but this shit is tired.
