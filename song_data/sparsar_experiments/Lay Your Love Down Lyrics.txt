Lay Your Love Down Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Lay Your Love Down.

There was change in the blacks of your eyes.
From the gold to the grays of our skies.
I beat myself up with these thoughts.
These regrets, these question marks.
If I stay... would we fall? Would we rise?

So lay your love down.
Lay your love down for me.
Lay it all down.
Lay it all for me now.
Lay your love down.
Lay your love down for me.
Do you... hear me call?
Do you... need me at all?

Then it changed, in the blink of an eye.
Saw the sun be replaced by the night.
I learned your value when I paid the cost.
I'm gonna win back the things I've lost.
If I stay... would we fall? Would we rise?

So, lay your love down.
Lay your love down for me.
Lay it all down.
Lay it all for me now.
Lay your love down.
Lay your love down for me.
Do you... hear me call?
Do you... need me at all?

From the night and distance space.
To the light of your embrace.
From the night and distance space.
We could rise.
If I stay, would we fall? Would we rise?

So, lay your love down.
Lay your love down for me.
Lay it all down.
Lay it all for me now.
Lay your love down.
Lay you love down for me.
Do you... hear me call?
Do you... need me at all?
So, lay your love down for me, yeah.
So lay your love down for me.
