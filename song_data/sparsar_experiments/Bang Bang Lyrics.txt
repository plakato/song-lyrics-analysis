Bang Bang Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.


Somewhere south of Winslow the road went right and I went left.
Nothing out my window but desert, dirt, and death.
From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air.
Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear.
Oh, I picked her up.
Sure enough that girl was real, sitting in my truck.
Said I know a place called the Broken Wheel where we can try our luck.
Five miles north of 66, behind old man Lester's barn.
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sherriff claims that he.
don't know.

Oh, here I go again, singing.
BANG BANG.
That cell door's closing in.
BANG BANG.
Here I go again.
BANG BANG.
Those chains around my legs.
BANG BANG.
This is where the highway ends.

4 AM I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear.
I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear.
Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes.
When the door flew open - she came out screaming.
DRIVE FOOL DRIVE.

Oh, blue lights in my eyes.
Oh, I must've been outta my mind.

Here I go again.
BANG BANG.
