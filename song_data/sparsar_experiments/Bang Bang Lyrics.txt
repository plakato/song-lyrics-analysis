Bang Bang Lyrics
by Swollen Members.


I crept up from above and took you out.
Look, it's a new sheriff in town.
Hope you know that you're going down.
Bang Bang, Bang Bang, I shot ya down.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.
Look at ya now.

My top drop back in the new SL55.
'09, girl, I live real well.
Got the Michelin S rims. What up Sprewell?
Swaggerlicious baby, something like a pimp.
Ha, you know I get it, Gucci new fitteds.
Deputy Dick 'Em Dan, give.
her the business.
Ha, don't fake the funk. You know we get it girl.
KC they know the camp all across the world.
Don't make me have to light shit up.
Got the real canaries, boy, I brighten shit up.
Got a sloppy jewel game? Better tighten that up.
My cash game up. My gas gauge full.
Young fly crook. Push ki's and go to school.
Never met a nigger like me. I do what I do.

We don't need no badges. We.
don't need your address.
We know where you live. You know what this is.
The kids? You should put em in the truck with wifey.
Before I let me niner start singing like the Isleys.
Brother, discover the pleasure, the pain.
Whether you survive is the name of the game.
Put 'em on a stretcher. Blood pressure to the brain.
Its an ethical medical let-it-go mayne.
You's a buster. Yo, trust us, it's a west coast thang.
Don't fuck up or fuck with us. Got the best scope aim.
You choke up, I break out the A grade smoking.
And this beat was produced by Rob the Viking.

I've been on my grind since a kid on my big wheel.
Don't know how to put this but I'm kind of a big deal.
Little giant, stop trying to assume my position.
I'll be firing my iron at ya dudes.
Bang Bang my crew gang bang the slang gang.
Doper than a kilo of Colombian Bam-Bam.
Rocking with a king ping doing my thing thing.
Listen to ya album and then I drain my main vein.
On it. Dog-gon-it! Look, Boss Hogg and wanted.
I'm a Duke of Hazzard. Your group's a has-been.
Popping pills and gambling, I got stupid habits.
I'm a ruthless addict. Gucci fabrics.
My group is magic and my troops are savage.
I'm a little dude with a very big ego.
So I roll with very big people.
Bad motherfuckers. Not saying we evil.
But feels like everything we do is illegal.
I'm fly like an eagle, eagle.
Listen to you rapping and I whip it like Devo.
I ain't a clown, dawg. Cash invested.
Friends ride bikes. Black vests and Death's Heads.
Fucked up times. Can't trust your best friend.
I got friends doing ten from what I just suggested.
I'm Yosemite Sam. My two cannons go BAM!

I'm in my hoody when I lay in the sheets.
Bitch bit my baby mouse to try and fuck with my sleep.
We them comeback kids like Eli and Peyton.
Brothers from another like 50 and Shady.
Fuck you, pay me. She fucked you, pay me!
Pimping ain't easy but the money amazing.
Now we the best, and now I think it's time I remind you.
We can drop a body off were no one can find dude.
I'm in a crime mood so I'm a get cash.
Vision is point, dawg, Criss Cross, Steve Nash.
Catlike reflex, Baltimore defense.
I can't guard niggers so I stay on defense.
I don't pretend to speak false pretense.
I spring right into action, make you fall like C says.
Baby monster shot town, stay on the bull shit.
I'm like, oh shit! Who you think you fucking with?
