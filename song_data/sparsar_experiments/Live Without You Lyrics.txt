Live Without You Lyrics
by Tynisha Keli.

No, No.
No, No.
No, No.

It's been a while since.
Since I saw your face.
Just thought I'd let you know.
You're love can't be replaced.
Knew it would take some time.
But now I realized I'm still not over you.
So many memories of us together.
They never fade away.
No matter whether.
Or not you got somebody in your life now.
That's why I'm telling you right now.

I can't help but think.
Think about you.
Everytime I see your picture in a frame.
And now I realize.

I don't want to live without you.
Can't make it by myself.
I don't want to live without you.
I don't want nobody else.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't want nobody else.

And all my friends say.
They say I'm crazy.
But they don't understand.
Just what you do to me.
You take control of me.
Like you're my destiny, you bring out the best in me.
And there will never be another.
Who can love me like you love me when you toucha.
Ooh I can feel it right now babe.
Ooh you know you put it down babe.

I can't help but think.
Think about you.
Everytime I see your picture in a frame.
And now I realize.

I don't want to live without you.
Can't make it by myself.
I don't want to live without you.

I don't want nobody else.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't want nobody else.

I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
Nobody else can touch me.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
And love me the way you love me.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
Nobody else can touch me.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
All my ladies say.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
Nobody else can touch me.
No, No.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
And love me the way you love me.
No, No.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't want nobody else.

I don't want to live without you.
Can't make it by myself.
I don't want to live without you.
I don't want nobody else.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
No, No.
I don't want nobody else.
