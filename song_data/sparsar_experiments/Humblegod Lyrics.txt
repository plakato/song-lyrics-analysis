Humblegod Lyrics
by Yung Huf.


I want a bitch with a Gucci belly.
Pistol in her purse.
I want you to twerk.
I-I-I want you to twerk.

Yu Gi Oh champion.
Bitches love that.
I Crimson Chin the pussy.
Keeping coke under my hubcaps.
Reading your mind.
But I skipped a couple chapters.
Giving Jesus Gucci sandals.
In the middle of some rapture.
But catch me on the jetski.
I leave 'em all perplexed, Crowley.
Doing drivebys on pterodactyl's.
Eat out Ms. Finster's pussy.
Hard-on's like Exodia.
Android 18 bitches in the bathtub.
Milk bottles fulla codeine and vodka.
That's trill cuh.
But I stay drinking Capri-Sun.
Dealing crack with Tarzan.
To Starsky and Hutch.
In a Batmobile.
Time travelling to Hitler.
Drank him underneath the table.
Free'd the Jews from all the chambers.
When I got him into selling bangles.
You're welcome.

Was a Luchadore.
Hiding in some wedding cakes and churches.
Eat that pussy like Pronutro.
Dick is hung like Ian Curtis.
Poppin' pills like Joplin.
Trading AK's for green cards.
Tagging up a precinct.
And getting blowjobs from Charizard.
Doing the cooking dance.
Repping a get-money-gut.
Meditating in the jungle.
My Gucci belly just stunts.
In Raybans with Pygmie ho's hittin' blunts.
Getting head from Muriel while Courage just watched.
Head decked out with a macaroni du-rag.
Smoked out like a firefighter.
I don't mean to brag.
But her pussy soft like Yamcha.
Her pussy soft like Michael Cera.
I spit timeless like a watch ain't on my wrist.
I don't spit for the money.
I spit so I can fuck your bitch.
