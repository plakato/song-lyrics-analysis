All That I Need Is You Lyrics
by Amy Grant.

Lord, you know it's been a busy day.
And I'm just weary to my bones.
I hope you'll understand if I don't pray.
But I need my rest to carry on.

Why do I kid myself? You see my heart --.
The me I try so to ignore.
And Lord, you see how very weak I am.
I just can't hide it anymore.

But all of a sudden I knew.
That I'd never be wanting as long as I'm leaning on you.
Oh, Lord. All that I need is you.

Everytime when the doubting comes.
And I seem to lose my way;.
When I cry within.
Cause I need a friend.
But I just don't say --.
You know that I need you --.
All at once it's clear.
Even though you're here.
I've tried to make it on my own.
I'm not trusting you.

Oh, Lord, you know.
That I really need our time together?
Only your strength can see me through.
So talk with me now.
As you walk with me now.
In this quiet time.
I'm waiting on you.

Cause all of a sudden I knew.
That I'd never be wanting as long as I'm leaning on you.
Oh, Lord. All that I need is you.

Cause all of a sudden I knew.
That I'd never be wanting as long as I'm leaning on you.
Oh, Lord. All that I need is you.
All that I need.
All that I need is you!
Is you!
Is you!

Is you.
