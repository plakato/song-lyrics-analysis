E.m-bed.ded Lyrics
by Yung Jake.

I made this video put it on youtube.
I put it up I got 500 views.
It blowing up. hit counts getting bigger.
I see it on a blog. now its all over twitter.

Damn. I think justin retweeted it.
It's a torrent now, mad bitches seeding it.
I'm on on Facebook, bitches commented.
The song ain't even been on for one minute.

Haters thumbing down just to spite me.
It don't matter though, these bitches like me.
I got mad swag. Pound sign. Mad swag.
I'm rolling blunts puffing on this #hashtag.

Your #1 bookmark. I'm on your feed, bruh.
I rep websites. Ginlane Media.
They say the buzz is dying but I won't let it.
Shout it out, I'm tryna get embedded.

I'm tryna get embedded.
I'm tryna get laid out.
I'm tryna get embedded.
I'm tryna get played out.
I'm tryna get embedded.
I'm tryna get laid out.
I'm tryna get embedded.
I'm tryna get played out.

Im #trending now I'm an internet meme.
Getting loaded, sippin' dat lean.

Whatever dat means. I dont even know.
First they seeding Yung Jake now im seeding hoes.

I'm embedded on Tumblr getting hits, mane.
I'm embed with your girl she watching yung jake.
These banner bitches right there.
I'm a player. she all up in my player.

Flash photos girls on that richardson.
Im on the same posts all the real bitches in.
'e' from your flicker. gave it to.

Yung jake fi'na get geeked up with 'er.

Black and whites in your theme looking vintage, mane.
I'm on your iPhone bitches got Instagram.
Tryna get embedded. getting blogs.

Copy the that link on the bottom and send it.

Yung Jake hanging out. Yung Jake doing stuff.
Bitches in my circles. New shit. Google+.
Making stacks on stack on stacks on.
Making money as long as my Mac's on.

Internet raps. find me in my Rhymezone.
Making art. niggas find me on Rhizome.
That's me E dot M dash B.
E D dot D E forward slash D.
