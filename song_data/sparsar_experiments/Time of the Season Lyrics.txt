Time of the Season Lyrics
by The Zombies.


It's the Time Of the Season.
When love runs high.
In this time, give it to me easy.
And let me try with pleasured hands.

To take you in the sun to ..
To show you every one. It's the time of.
The season for loving.

What's your name? Who's.
your daddy?
Is he rich like me?
Has he taken any time.
To show you what you need to live.

Tell it to me slowly.
I really want to know. It's the time of.
The season for loving.

What's your name? Who's your daddy?
, is he rich like me.
Has he taken any time.
To show you what you need to live.

Tell it to me slowly.
I really want to know. It's the time of.
The season for loving.
