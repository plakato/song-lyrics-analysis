16th St. Dozens Lyrics
by Two Gallants.

Cops and junkies hurl their sophistries.
And hail cacophony.
Try not hard to shake this off of me.
Howl you fools, it's all for naught.

But on 16th street we wait for holiness.
Vaccinate ourselves from loneliness.
Masquerade through homes of homelessness.
And oh, I hope we'll not get over this.

Here the now is now upon us.
Everyone must share this on us.
Ancients have no more to loan us.
All our debts unpaid.

On 16th street we rise in numbers.
Once a name now just a number.
Scream for all the unsaid, unheard prisoners on parade.
Sweet Dolores, mi mamasita.
Seems each day I still re-meet you.
Disculpame mi pobrecita.
Guess I left things incomplete.

But all this noise will soon be over.
So let's drink until you're halfway sober.
Red rover's already over.
But the last thing that we need is closure.

Now it's time for us to swallow all this loss until tomorrow.
Pay back all the time we've borrowed.
Anger well displayed.

On 16th street we fall in numbers.
No one questions, no one wonders.
Scream for all the unsaid, unheard hoodlums on parade.
