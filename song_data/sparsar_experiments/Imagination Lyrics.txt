Imagination Lyrics
by Swim Deep.


Imagination can't know how to lie but I can.
I believe in anything that's great.
That's my lie, yes I can.
I went away for just a day.
Walked a million miles in the wildest way.
Can't leave this planet not today.
Messed it up and go do the same.

Yes I can, stop and it's over, lies.
Yes I ran, from getting older, so wise.
Cause everybody's holding back.
It's not what you wanted huh?
Everybody told you that.
Everybody's holding back.
It's not what you wanted huh?

I'm not a man, I'm a word, and I'm not stronger.
It's not fate, equality moulds into love.
Everybody told me that.
So what could be different?
But I'm not a soldier man.
Everybody's leaving Earth.
It's not what we wanted huh?

Swim deep, and keep your lovely eyes running free.
