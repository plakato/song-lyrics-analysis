Next Year Lyrics
by HV Gutter.

 HV Gutter yeah, I'm so sick and tired of these fake niggas, I say.
what I wanna when I want nigga, I'm just steady mobbin' niggas hate but I, I.
stay grinding get straight to the point you niggas wouldn't even know what to.
do if you took walk in my shoes, tell me who I am, tell me how'd I get here,.
everyday's a different day but you feel like you been here, tell me how feels.
when they say you gon get it next year  .
  .
 HV Gutter and you grinded all Summer long, feel like your closest.
friends are in it for the ride along, man thats the type of shit that make me.
wanna ride alone, can't no one tell me that I didn't do it on my own, gettin'.
stoned walking home writing on my phone on my lonely road and it's cold that's.
just how it goes, since like back in 2004 the only thing I know, is every.
.
fucking far I'd go, since Jokaz Trick I swear they want me for my pot of gold,.
I run the Rose if you didn't you should probably should know, I think it's.
time we took it back where we started before, before the hate just getting.
blazed when we thought it would go, and if you got something to say come and.
holla at big bro, cause ain't no time for turning back I done waited too long,.
but every step is for the Fam I just thought you should know, if you ain't.
with us then go.. yeah  .
  .
 HV Gutter I'm so sick and tired of these fake niggas, I say what I.
wanna when I want nigga, I'm just steady mobbin niggas hate but I, I stay.
grindin get straight to the point you niggas wouldn't even know what to do if.
you took walk in my shoes, tell me who I am, tell me how'd I get here,.
everydays a different day but you feel like you been here, tell me how feels.
when they say you gon get it next year.. yeah.
