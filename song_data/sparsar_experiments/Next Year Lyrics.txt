Next Year Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.


I don't know where I.
Am going to rest my head tonight.
So I won't promise that I'll speak.
To you today.
But if I ever find.
Another place, a better time.
For that moment.
I was never what I am.

Take to me to where you are.
What you've become.
And what you will do.
When I am gone.
I won't forget.
I won't forget.

Maybe someday.
You'll be somewhere.
Talking to me.
As if you knew me, saying.
I'll be home for next year, darling.
I'll be home for next year.

In between the lines.
Is the only place you'll find.
What you're missing.
That you didn't know was there.
So when I say goodbye.
You must do your best to try.
And forgive me this weakness.
This weakness.

Cause I don't know what to say.
Another day.
Another excuse to be sent your way.
Another day.
Another year.

Maybe someday.
You'll be somewhere.
Talking to me.
As if you knew me, saying.
I'll be home for next year, darling.
I'll be home for next year.

And maybe sometime.
In a long time.
You'll remember.
What I had said there, I said.
I'll be home for next year, darling.
I'll be home for next year.

If you think of me.
I will think of you.

Maybe someday.
You'll be somewhere.
Talking to me.
As if you knew me, saying.
I'll be home for next year, darling.
I'll be home for next year.

And maybe sometime.
In a long time.
You'll remember.
What I had said there, I said.
I'll be home for next year.

Maybe someday.
You'll be somewhere.
Talking to me.
As if you knew me, saying.
I'll be home for next year, darling.
I'll be home for next year.
