Redman Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Redman.
My style is...milk of magnesia.
Crush the five-speed and bust em'.
The more the merrier, secure the area.
My la familia is ultimate superior.
We don't jack cars, we jack aircraft carriers.
I bounce like trampolines when I be blowin' the fiends.
The pieces, hem em' like sewing machines and Jesus.
When the shadows of the barrel pointin' out my boy Camaro.
I get punished like pharoahe for splittin'.
You better off singin' Christmas carols for Christmas.
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment.
The president of chickenhead conventions.
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin'.
I got a headache from the stress, success.
Now wearin' a vest.
5-11's from bein' dirty, courts at nine thirty.
Pourin' the liquor down with my man Trace Lee.
We gettin' down, rock from sea to sea.
Back to Jersey with Sway and Tech.
I put a hole in ya chest just to see who's next.
Burn ya like able techs.
And when I'm on the mic I got to grease.
I'm nutty like professor.
I make ya say Hercules, Hercules.
Then jump with the 4-5 pump.
Who's the brother that wanna run off the mouth and dump.
I come through the West then I come through the East.
Every time I spit off the lip it's like a chrome piece.
45 lyrical degrees.
I'm like Denise Williams, I'm givin' mags.
Chill, chill...chill, chill.
