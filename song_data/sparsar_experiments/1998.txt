1998
by Aziz.

I'm tryna get a timeshare in every time zone.
Like a tickin time bomb.
Couple ticky tocks til I'm on.
The times here so catch me for I'm gone.
Make a stint with my entourage like Saigon.
Catch me while the shows are cheap.
Damn.
Or pray and kiss ya rosary.
That, nobody will notice me.
But the opposite is happening you find me where the hoes'll be.
I choose door one with the promise behind it.
Is Jimmy Bond was pondering in the quantum of solace.
Do bears shit in the woods?
Did you father your daughter?
Hear the awkwardest silence, I'm often reminded.
These niggas is shady like the eyes of a baby rockin a bonnet.
Gimme the beat and I'm hoppin up on it.
Its only time and it pass like Rubio.
Fuck it, I'm on it.
Look for your talent, you not gonna find it.
Hey.
Now here go some ebonics.
If you hip, then you familiar.
If he say that he dry then he just got nothin sell ya.
If she not fuckin wit you that mean she doesnt feel ya.
A L can mean a couple things.
Be a licence or a liquor store or cigar slash dutchie thing.
If you chips that mean you wack.
And if you really wack then you the big bag.
A slice is a eighth a dub is the G.
The good is the bud, Celts are the C's, who fuckin with me.
A handle is a gallon of liquor.
And if you chopped or wounded that mean the liqs had you sicker.
If you a herb then you a lame ass nigga, nigga.
You get the picture?
I need a Premo beat for 99, what's next boss?
