Contagious Freestyle Lyrics
by Sway.

Yo I conquer the earth, writin rhymes til my palm hurts.

The menace send this for the spinach the ghetto bastard.
Full metal jacket causin more racquet that tennis.
My rhyme will get in your mind just like an image.
Your ceaser like teeth I take em out like a dentist.
Now let's say, you battle me on your best day.
You still couldn't see me thru telescopes and x-ray.
Put you dead in your bread basket as of lead bastard.
I spit acid blowin out mc's like head gaskets.
I shred nigga move or lose his head backwards.
Swallowin mc's as if they were Sudafed tablets.
Living these Wonder Years like Fred Savage.
Walkin the planet wit verbal havoc to spread havoc.
I hit niggas in their shoulders.
Get in your mind like gingko bulova.
Call me the shrink niggas be looking gay wearin pink.
G-strings up they little asses.
Dump em out like bud ashes.
Call me classious clay I never delay instant replay...
