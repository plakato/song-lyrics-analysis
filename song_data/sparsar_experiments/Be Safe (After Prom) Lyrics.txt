Be Safe (After Prom) Lyrics
by Quarta Quarta.


I'm not saying don't have fun, just watch what you indulge.
Easier to make the right choice, than going to a funeral.
I learned that from my math teacher.
Wisdom is everywhere, you just have to be a wisdom seeker.
And accept the concepts, of love and respect.
We're living life, but do we live it correct?
Lord help us. To go the right way.
To make the wise choice, live to see another day.
It's sad to see what's become of this generation.
Honestly, it's a lack of fundamentals and basics.
Knowledge that is taught, can be knowledge that is gained.
One man receives knowledge, the other man stays the same.
And I plan to be the first choice.
If you're living wise, then I rejoice.
Because you understand the statement I'm trying to display.
I just want to see you all next Monday.

So be safe....
Be safe....
Be safe....
Be safe....

I'm so thankful for what God instilled in me.
Poetically talented, but I'm trapped in my soliloquies.
Only because...no one will listen to me.
Even though I speak wisdom, it's just hard to please.
A society drowning in alcoholic beverages.
Promoting a use of marijuana and abuse of medicine.
Well that substance of vice, you medicate with.
Will be the same substance located, in your cause-of-death statement.
I don't want that to happen to you.
I don't wish that situation on any of the youth.
After some drinks, they think they can drive the road ahead.
One second you swerve, the next second you're dead.
Stop letting irresponsibility lead your goals.
We're all flesh and blood. Nobody is invincible.
I'm praying we don't see a tragic demise.
I'm saying all of this in hopes that I save some lives.
