The Mixture Lyrics
by Volumes.

Take a picture of me.
I'm dying for more.
I really can't believe this.
We just all want to be on TV.
A minute of this FaceTime.
Tearing down your door.
Driven by one-hundred forms of fear.

I've been trying.
To deny this all.
For too long.

To keep my mouth shut.
And it's got me nowhere.
To expose you.
I cannot blame you.
I will not please you.
I do not need you.
To do the things.
That get you off.

When you tell me.
The things I have to.
When you call me.
I don't want to.
Out here with a backpack.
Traveling back tracked.
When I don't need to.
It never made sense to me.
But it always made sense to you.

And I will still be here.
In front of you.
In spite of you.

So smile.
As you look in the mirror.
Give me my receipt now though.
Fuck this industry.
Excuse me to death.
Can we say fuck it?
You can have metal back.
You can have it back!

3x.
I'll say it again.
I said I'm in it to win it.
Don't hold.
Can't you tell I'm already in the mix?
