Dream On Lyrics
by Rustie.

I don't ask I just go for it.
And I don't care who sees.
I don't like to brag about it.
But I am amazing.

And you can't wait to see me walking towards your fate.
And you won't move an inch to the day.

When you see me.
Tell me you'll see me while you're sleeping, sleeping.
This is magic, love.
Don't you let this go.

'Till you see me.
Tell me you'll see me while you're dreaming, dreaming.

So dream on.
My dreamer.
So dream on.
My dreamer.
So dream on.
My dreamer.
So dream on.
My dreamer.

You don't make me into something.
I could never be.
And you don't ask for anything.
But to stay with me.
And I could never think of anyone else to try.
?

You will see me.
Tell me you'll see me while you're sleeping, sleeping.
This is magic, love.
Don't you let this go.

'Till you see me.
Tell me you'll see me while you're dreaming, dreaming.

So dream on.
My dreamer.
So dream on.
My dreamer.
So dream on.
My dreamer.
So dream on.
My dreamer.

You will see me.
I come to visit while you're dreaming, dreaming.
