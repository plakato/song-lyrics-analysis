by Yung Neptune (AKA YUNG JZ7).

You not a real thug if you don't “wrap” when you queasy.
Easier than mackin ez mac hoes cuz they cheesy.
I'm so sleazy I dig jonnies out the trash rub em on yr sleevy.
Catch me and my steezy steezin hard with a hard on at bard.
Getting bop on top of parked car cuz I'm leanin.

Sippin purple on a steeple waving hard like skeezus.
I seize suss and shake it down to bake and reach us.
Reeses cups. Cop a feel, out the banana like I'm a fucking peel.
And if you don't see me it's cuz I'm off the reel.

Steal a base, free base, later gater krokodil.
I'm a funky ass vill just sippin on some pillz.
M357 bout to OD to heaven.
They say god's the real seven.
11 but listen I ain't even stopping for a slurpee.
I drop down and bang out ten burpees.
Like I was in boot camp. Pick up a loose tramp.
And skate down a wood ramp.

Magic lamps, niggas can call me Aladdin.
Yall are just has beens.
Catch me in the past tense.
Teamin with my genie.
And everything is easy.
Y'all is just mad cuz my wish was fucking creepy.

Barsss.
