AF1's (Air Force 1's) Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?

B-bitch named Lean,.
Emperor of the city.
Silver rings on, sitting on 50.
Blowing on Winter, icy.
like a stunner.
Looking like Winter, temperature like the summer.
Chain like a seahorse, Is that really Leandoer?
All white Dior, all I wear is Dior.
Catch me on my samsung,.
SBE anthem.
I be in the night creeping round' like the phantom.

Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?

Ecco2k &amp; _Yung Lean_.
Airbrushed, Air ice like I'm 19.
Light speed, colour, lime green look like ice cream.
Light beam, call it light stream or you'll white beam.
Five keys or my eyes bleed on the Nikes.
Headlock, scope red dot, It's a head shot.
Shell shock, do the air-drop, I got dead stock.
Flow like purple drugs sprite, that's my blood type.
I wish none of this was real life, but it's sunlight.
_You don't know what I'm up to_.
_We don't talk about it 'less you do_.
Got a fight crew, we sky team.
Shoot around town, got.
bad dreams.
It's weed and purple we up to.
Just got a bunch of em' Nike shoes.
For I make big money, my own crew too.
We the Sadboys and we'll fuck you.

Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
Six Air Force 1's, I got Air Force on.
Put the mask on shawty, shawty what you want?
