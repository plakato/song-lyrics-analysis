AF1's (Air Force 1's) Lyrics
by Yung Lean.


Six Air Force 1's. I got Air Force on 
Put the mask on shawty shawty. What you want 
Six Air Force 1's. I got Air Force on 
Put the mask on shawty shawty. What you want 
Six Air Force 1's. I got Air Force on 
Put the mask on shawty shawty. What you want 
Six Air Force 1's. I got Air Force on 
Put the mask on shawty shawty. What you want, 
 
B-bitch named Lean 
Emperor of the city 
Silver rings on sitting on 50 
Blowing on Winter. Icy
Like, a stunner 
Looking like Winter temperature like the summer 
Chain like a seahorse, Is that really Leandoer 
All white Dior? All I wear is Dior. 
Catch me on my samsung 
SBE anthem, 
I, be in the night creeping round' like the phantom 
 
Six Air Force 1's. I got Air Force on 
Put the mask on shawty shawty. What you want 
Six Air Force 1's. I got Air Force on 
Put the mask on shawty shawty. What you want 
Six Air Force 1's. I got Air Force on 
Put the mask on shawty shawty. What you want 
Six Air Force 1's. I got Air Force on 
Put the mask on shawty shawty. What you want:
