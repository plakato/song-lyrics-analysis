Snake Eyes Lyrics
by Sworn In.

Shoot me fucking dead.
Take me away from this place.
Cause all I see here is your god damn face.
Torturing me.
Infecting my life.
If this is all I see I'd rather go blind.
Play this game with me.
Walk to the end.
Roll your mother fucking dice and play again.
No hope for you or I.
We are all blind, we are all blind.
The start is the end and the end is the start.
No sight, no love, no friends, no heart.
I'm in the dark.
We're in the dark.
These bags under my eyes are getting darker.
And I've never heard of sleep.
The herder is a fucking illusion.
There's no hope for the sheep.
At the end of the day I could say I'm haunted.
Can't tell if I'm dead or just fucking unwanted.
At the end of the day I could say I'm haunted.
Shoot me fucking dead.
I'll let my eyes roll back into my head.
Wishing I was dead, wishing I was dead.
If I could take back every single word I've said.
Maybe I'd be less unwanted.
Maybe I'd be fucking dead.
Snake eyes rolling back into my head.
Wishing I was dead.
Wishing I was dead.
