Angry Lyrics
by Quiet Riot.

Not a lover not a fighter.
Always out of my league.
Sometimes maybe.
Life ain't what it seems.
There's a man in the back say's.
I gotta keep still.
Someone at the front door.
Says just do what you will.
Do what you will !
My ears are ringing.
With voices unclear.
The sun is setting.
Is it love or is it fear.

I'm angry.
I'm an angry young man.
When love ain't enough.
Angry-I'm an angry young man when.
My heart's gettin tough.
I'm an angry young man.
Yes I am !

Running down the alley.
On a hot summer's day.
Fellin kinda dangerous-trouble.
One step away.
Well I'm walkin the walk.
And I'm talkin the talk.
But when it comes to lovin.
I'm alone in the dark.
Yes I am !
Runnin on empty under the gun.
The pressure's building.
The storm has just begun....

Angry.
I'm an angry young man.
When love ain't enough.
Angry-I'm an angry young man when.
My heart's gettin tough.
Angry I'm an angry young man when.
I can't get enough.
I'm an angry young man.
When push comes to shove.
I'm an angry young man !

Give it to me !

I got emotional baggage.
That I drag around.
With all this dirty laundry.
I gotta get outa town.
Yes I do !
Say hello to my demons.
I count then as friends.
Ain't no denyin they'll be here til.
The end.

Cause I'm angry....

Angry, angry I feel hopeless.
Angry angry, I love my face.
