Black Eyes Lyrics
by VON.

Behind the Black Eyes the soulless tormentors.
Fears architects of relentless terror!
The dark ones they come for us invade our minds control our thoughts.
It has begun the darkest hour we shall be free the end has come.
Ritual of The Black Mass summoning the ancients.
The dark ones return to us unleashing a plague.
Extinction destroyers of deaths design they've come for their human slave.
experiments.
Cold Dark Black Eyes.
