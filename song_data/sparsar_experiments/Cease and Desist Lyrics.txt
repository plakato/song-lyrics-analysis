Cease and Desist Lyrics
by Quentin Miller.


Started off the ACA series off of Miami beach y'all know that shit.

Dropped from the label and still wasn't faded.
Gave these niggas some of the hottest songs of the year and I'm still.
underrated.
And I couldn't care less.
I'm put in this position to make y'all's clearer.
If money's not involved I'm not involved neither.
What you making off the door with my name on the bill.
From now on, oh no nigga.
Don't approach niggas until that parts cleared up.
Nike store all geared up, ah shit bruh.
Isn't that yup you guessed it.
Checked up 'til they pay their respects and I rest in peace.
Yes you are blessed if you met with me.
Niggas sleeping on me I'm like who them.
Think about 2015 without Q.M.
1317 ya that's the crew them.
What would hip-hop be if y'all ain't knew them.
Hop right back in that car that I own.
Took my daughter back home, life altering calls on the phone.
I'm really moving ya I'm really moving.
That Puerto Rican with me new habla Espa√±ol very fleuent.
And when she fuck me she know what she doing, that's important.
I'm good at finding talent young Barry Gordon.
You out of town with a young Paris Hilton.
Hit the stores and bought another pair of Jordans just for the sport of it.

Break.
Are you not enter? Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained? Isn't this what you wanted are you?

No more Mr. Niceguy Quentin Miller.
No more love from my side for you niggas.
Middle fingers all you niggas get.
Try to run off with my swag I send a cease and desist.

Young how he getting, so much potential I don't see the ceiling.
Before he sent me God briefed me on my mission.
Could've easily went in on niggas that ain't what I'm here for.
I've been heating up the stove tryna water whip a Grammy.
Million something plays million sold Miller platinum, wow.
