Hope Lyrics
by Wolfgun.


Hey, can you make the flowers bloom or sing?
Or paint the blades of grass the perfect shade of green?
Oh, you can't put the spin on Saturn's rings.
Don't you worry 'bout the summer in the spring.
Hey, can you put a fire inside the sun?
Or make it rise so it can shine on everyone?
Oh, let us write about the joy its light can bring.
Don't you worry 'bout the summer in the spring.

Don't you worry 'bout the summer.
It won't change to suit another.
Carry light on winds and wander.
Through the fields of sunlit trees.
Fair the hills, and fair the sunlight.
Let the clouds rain down on every life.
And when the sun returns we'll know it did for you and me.

Hey, can you count the stars up in the sky?
Or tell the moon to let us see tomorrow's light?
Oh, we can plant a seed for future dreams.
Don't you worry 'bout the summer in the spring.
Hey, can you make the flowers bloom or sing?
Or paint the blades of grass the perfect shade of green?
Oh, someday we will understand these things.
But for now, we'll look for happiness in spring.
