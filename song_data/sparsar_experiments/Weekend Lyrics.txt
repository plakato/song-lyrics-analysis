Weekend Lyrics
by QUARTERBACKS.

I feel best.
When I am.
Driving eighty.
Headed downstate to.
Your house david.

We'll wake up late.
We'll listen to tapes.
Maybe grab some bagels.
Go to a show and afterwards.
Record some demos.

Whenever I feel.
Kind of tired.
All I have to do.
Is call Elaiza.

Just hearing her voice.
Makes me feel better.
I just wish we could.
Always be together.

But we can't.
That's why I need.
These weekends away.
To see the people.
I should see every day.

I kind of hate the town.
Where I live.
But as soon as I leave.
I start to miss it.

That's why you gotta.
Come and visit.
Next time.
You need a weekend away.
You got a spot.
Where you can stay.
