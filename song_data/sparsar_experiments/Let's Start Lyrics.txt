Let's Start Lyrics
by Ty.


Let's start.
Let's start.
Le-le-let's start.
Le-le-le--let's start.
Le-le-le.
Le-le-let's start.
Le-le-le--let's start.
Le-le-let's.
Let's start.

They say the sun don't shine forever.
But I'm categorized as soft when my actions say I'm tougher than ever.
Al Green let's stay together.
Through a minefield of naysayers, see why I still endeavor.
Nestled between a rock and a hard place.
We cover more notes than a rock guitar case.
I don't take any inspiration from Scarface.
Never stood still, I even slip with a fast pace.
Nat King Cole, unforgettable soul.
That does not walk the path that Johnny Cash controls.
Ring the bell but don't move for whom the bell tolls.
Follow fashions need to run and sell clothes.
No popularity contest, I'm trying to make meaningful music.
My conquest designed to shake.
Whoever's on it feel the sonic far and wide.
Close the distance let's get real platonic..... and roll...

Let's start.
Le-le-le--let's start.
Le-le-le--let's start.
Le-le-le--let's start.
Let's start.
Le-le-le--let's start.

Pulling rabbits out of thin air is not my habit.
Please, give me room, let me work my magic.
No day off work straight through the Sabbath.
Shake the dice and stroll past snakes and ladders.
In a rush, give me the keys to the truck.
The road to victory is peas to the mush.
To fight the power becomes easy to us.
In the midnight hour, we turn leaves into dust.
Let's skip breakfast at Tiffany's.
I'm trying to skip by what you're slipping me.
Giving me false hopes of living vividly.
Through dusty telescopes you hold timidly.
Nahhh I refuse this weak imagery.
Eating stale food is not obligatory.
So let's start the dialogue.
'Cos we're one people reporting to some kinda God..... now.... let's go.

Let's start.
Let's start.
Le-le-let's start.
Le-le-le--let's start.

Rap now is a circus with clowns.
Rap circles around.
Rap now is a circus with clowns.
Rap circles around.
Rap now is a circus with clowns.
Rap circles around.
Rap now is a circus with clowns.
Rap circles around.
Rap now is a circus with clowns.
Rap circles around.
Rap now is a circus with clowns.
Rap circles around.
Rap now is a circus with clowns.
Rap circles around.
