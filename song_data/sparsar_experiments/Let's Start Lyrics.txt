Let's Start Lyrics
by Ty.


Let'S start 
Let's start 
Le-le-let's start 
Le-le-le --. Let'S start 
Le-le-le, 
Le-le-let's start 
Le-le-le --. Let'S start 
Le-le-let's, 
Let's start 
, 
They, say the sun. Don'T shine forever 
But, I'm categorized as soft. When my actions say I'm tougher than ever: 
Al Green. Let'S stay together, 
Through a minefield of naysayers, see why I still endeavor 
Nestled between a rock and a hard place. 
We cover more notes than a rock guitar case. 
I, don't take any inspiration from Scarface 
Never stood still, I even slip with a fast pace. 
Nat, King Cole, unforgettable soul, 
That does not walk the path that Johnny Cash controls 
Ring the bell, but don't move for whom the bell tolls, 
Follow fashions, need to run and sell clothes. 
No popularity contest I'm trying to make meaningful music 
My conquest designed to shake 
Whoever's on it, feel the sonic far and wide 
Close the distance. Let'S get real platonic, ... .. and roll.. 
 
Let's start 
Le-le-le --. Let'S start 
Le-le-le --, let's start 
Le-le-le --. Let'S start 
Let's start 
Le-le-le --. Let'S start 
, 
Pulling rabbits out of thin air is not my habit. 
Please give me room. Let me work my magic 
No day off work straight through the Sabbath 
Shake the dice and stroll past snakes and ladders. 
In. A rush give me the keys to the truck 
The road to victory is peas to the mush 
To fight. The power becomes easy to us 
In the midnight hour. We turn leaves into dust 
Let's skip breakfast at Tiffany's 
I'm, trying to skip by what you're slipping me. 
Giving me false hopes of living vividly 
Through dusty telescopes. You hold timidly 
Nahhh. I refuse this weak imagery. 
Eating stale food is not obligatory 
So. Let'S start the dialogue. 
'Cos we're one people reporting to some kinda God, ... .., now ..., let's go .
 
Let'S start 
Let's start 
Le-le-let's start 
Le-le-le --. Let'S start .
 
Rap now is a circus with clowns, 
Rap circles around 
Rap now is a circus with clowns, 
Rap circles around 
Rap now is a circus with clowns, 
Rap circles around 
Rap now is a circus with clowns, 
Rap circles around 
Rap now is a circus with clowns, 
Rap circles Around 
Rap now is a circus with clowns, 
Rap circles. Around 
Rap now is a circus with clowns, 
Rap circles, around
