Battery Acid Lyrics
by Queens of the Stone Age.


Make you into dark.
Straight into your heart.
Sorry all you are.
I don't really care.
Well, I know you are.
Robots, robots.
Brainwashed babies, blood from a leech.
Spoken rabies.
Spastic, plastic, battery acid.
Yank on the leash.
Dragging you backwards.
Oh, my closed eyes.
Never see it coming.

There's nothing you can say.
You can't wish me away.
Every masochist gets a turn.
The sadistic twist you'll never learn.
Battery acid, battery acid.

Battery acid in my veins.
Unidentified remains.
Yes button broke to automatic.
Irrational dosage of furious static erasing what you are.
You were.
To feel the way you do.
A lie, then call it true.
Nothing except for yourself and nobody else.
Hanging over the edge.

There's nothing you can say.
You can't wish me away.
Every masochist gets a turn.
The sadistic twist you'll never learn.
In battery acid, battery acid, hey.
