Every Weekend Lyrics
by Wordplay.


I be turning up every weekend.
Burn a few ounces every weekend.
Different bad hoes every weekend.
Never turning down every weekend.
Na na, oh na na, oh na na, oh na na.
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance, do your dance.

Get my rest cause imma party all night.
Call my weed man cause I wanna take flight.
'Bout to hang with Chris and you know he got the baddies.
So imma knock the pussy out like fight night.
Chiraq my fourth home prolly cause of the vagina.
And I'm driving down Paulina and I'm looking for some hynas.
Hispanic short bad bitch, so bad she's a lifer.
Took her back to the room, strip her down and get behind her.
Saint Louis nigga, mindset on California.
This that Young Nigga Movement from New York to California.
Word Play cold nigga prolly got pneumonia.
If you don't do drugs I ain't got nothing for ya.
'Bout to go downtown in my hometown.
Nigga fucked up so you know he 'bout to clown.
AE'd up, I ain't in to that designer.
Bad bitch like Rihanna, cut her ass Benihana.

Smoking that purple stuff, drinking that purple stuff.
High as a muhfucka, turnt as a muhfucka.
'Bout to hit the club flirting with all the annie's.
Your bitch ugly, she prolly a tranny.
Throw that ass around, Hurricane Sandy.
You gotta nice face and a nice ass fanny.
Word Play the Don drink lean and take Xannies.
If you got a problem, keep the 45 handy.
Listening to Veggies tryna get my flow right.
Studio session imma be there all night.
If you down to fuck, why you being uptight.
Bad yellow bitch, call her Sunny Delight.
It's the weekend so I don't give a fuck.
Power hour going nigga what's in my cup?
Everclear, Absolut, Moonshine, Rosé.
On my Kristii shit, drunk off the José.
