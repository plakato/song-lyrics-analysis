Bars Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


6-0.
Gang,gang,gang.

Am In the cut with the Mop tryna claim.
A Niggas block, pop out Glock out.
Everybody getting sparked.
These Nigga snitches man.
My city full of narks.
Bullets flying at these targets.
You go think am throwing darts.
Slamming rakes, hopping gates.
If you disrespect L.A i'll put this 40.
To your face and just spazz out.
BossMan my shooter on the block.
With the nines out.
And am going crazy until they free.
My little bro nine out.
Extended clip eyes out.
Head shot blow your mind out.
Niggas pulling up, and they hiding out.
Aim for his back blow his spine out.
Tell these fuck niggas turn up.
Am sliding with the torch.
Mother fuckers getting burned up.

Team 600, full of shooters.
Macs,Tecs,German-Rugers.
Leave him stinking like.
Manuwa.
All my shorties fucking shooting.
Car roll trip, like naa don't shoot him,.
Niggas know how am rocking.
Am one hundred times six.
So these Y's am dropping.
Rubber band shit lil nigga what's popping.
Call me Breezy from the bricks.
I ain't never been a hooper.
All I know is shooting bricks.
Am out here on six-hundred.
Tin toes in this shit.
You don't want to tweak with us.
We got poles in this bitch.
