Drifting Lyrics
by Quill.

From the Album Voodoo Caravan 
Drifting 
Flowers growing, all around me, 
Making colors fade to grey. I believe I'm going crazy 
If it's the day I'll die. Won'T. You spread my ashes over 
The exploding sky. I'M gon na break this rusty cage of mine 
Speeding fast. I'M rolling lost in a daze 
Begging for peace of my mind, 
It's so easy to slip into wicked ways: 
I'm drifting, color-blind 
Well. Does it matter where I go tomorrow, 
I, don't know what to find 
Cause when the day is done. 
I watch another sunset burning red 
Until. The morning comes 
I, hear the howling wolves inside my head, 
Drifting- drifting 
Follow. Nowhere what you seek 
Is way beyond forever 
You got ta give. If you will reach 
Any higher, do you dare 
To leave it all behind 
Cause? I can make it anywhere 
Yeah, I'm drifting in time. 
I expect no. Tomorrow 
Yeah, I am drifting in mind. 
I could still be alive. 
How come. I can see thou', I'm blind 
Am. I sleeping I don't know. 
No need to erase and rewind. 
I am drifting in mind
