Overloaded Lyrics
by 4th Avenue Jones.

I love You.
You numb my pain.
When I get overloaded.
Your voice is my Novocain.
When I feel overloaded.
I swim in my tears and scream Your name.
So stressed I'm overloaded.
I'll die without You.
You keep me sane.
I'm broke down.
Overloaded.

And I slave at work all day.
Money can't buy what I wanted.
Mama said boy you dream big.
She don't know my dreams are haunted.
Really don't think I'm gon' make it.
Can't do this by myself.
Feel like I'm dying.
I need Your help.

Life's got me overloaded.
I'm living way too overloaded.
My life's got me overloaded.
I'm trippin' way too overloaded.
I'm overloaded and I need you.

Can't stay here.
I won't survive.
My mind's too overloaded.
I know I could run.
But where would I.
I'm trapped here overloaded.
So free when You love me but alone I'm enchained.
So stressed out overloaded.
You're the only thing that's keeping me sane.
I'm broke down.
Overloaded.

I love you.
You numb my pain.
When I get overloaded.
Your voice is my Novocain.
When I feel overloaded.
