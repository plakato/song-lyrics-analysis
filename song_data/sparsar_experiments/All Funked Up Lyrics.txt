All Funked Up Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

.
Oooohhh.
Ahhhhhhhhh.
.
Tornados spinning, I sit here grinning.
I think we've all seen this movie before.
This is confusing, almost amusing.
It's hard to tell up and down anymore.
When did it get so crazy, how did we lose control.
Everybodies shouting, how bad it really sucks.
.
Situation normal.
All funked up, We're all funked up.
.
We had some leaders, and they were cheaters.
But they came out smelling like a rose.
We should reject them, but we respect them.
For what they do when the door is closed.
Nothing in this world a simple man can do.
Stand up and be counted, hadn't you had enough.
.
Situation normal.
All funked up, Yeah we're all funked up.
We're funtionally disfuntional.
We're funtionally yeah disfuntional.
We're all funked up.
.
Uuughh?.
.
Don't you know the meaning of the word snafu.
Better known as trouble for me and you.
Murphy's law will get you, he's on his way.
Same old same old shit a different day.
.
Uuughh?.
Oh?.
.
Situation normal.
All funked up, we're all funked up.
We're all funked up.
We're all funked up.
.
Ooooohhhhh.
.
All funked up.
.
