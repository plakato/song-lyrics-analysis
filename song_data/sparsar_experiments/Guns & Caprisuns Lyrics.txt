Guns & Caprisuns Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


Swear my mama call me Nino for a reason, cause she know what type of nigga she.
raised.
Way before a nigga flow was appraised, she know the avenue that he on.
Where you gotta be down for the shits nigga, or get punished for your treason.
Made me promise not to eat the beef up nigga, had me feeling like a vegan.
Summer time 'round the way boy, it's only guns and caprisuns.
And I'm praying that it never end, cause I swear to God I hated school.
I rather drop out and gangbang, cause my big homie made it cool.
With his trunk full of 808s, and his denim full of 1 oh ohs.
Backyard we would spit our flows, money, power, and pussy, that be the anthem.
Started trappin' now these bitches think I'm hansome.
Mama say I need The Holy Ghost, I think a phantom ghost the answer.

One time for them dreamers out there staying on their pivot.
On the road to riches, I'mma get a speeding ticket.
For all my dogs in Heaven, and my homies that's in prison.
Who put their faith in me, I promise I'll complete the mission.
Man it's guns and caprisuns, all scattered on my floor.
Man it's hipster chicks and weaponry all scattered on my floor.
Said it's juice pouches and magazines all scattered on my floor.
Boy it's guns and caprisuns, it's guns and caprisuns.

My mindset could've kidnapped me, and been holding me for ransom.
Lost boy since the playground, had no one tending to my chances.
Now a nigga might take drugs, and other times take chances.
Just a dope boy wit dreams, I would skateboard and bump CREAM.
Cash rules everything around me, dollar dollar bill ya'll.
One time put your hands up high, cause a nigga wanna feel ya'll.

One day we gonn all be famous.
One day we gonn all be famous.
One day we gonn all be famous.
One day we gonn all be famous.

Told my mama one day, I would have a million dollars.
Then put it on a credit card, and let her do the honors.
