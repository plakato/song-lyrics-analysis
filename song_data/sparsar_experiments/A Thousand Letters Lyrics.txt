A Thousand Letters Lyrics
by Xandria.

A last embrace, last words to say.
Before the war took their fate away.
Before to kill became his forced task.
And bleeding fields were covered with sins.
His wounded heart is crying out for home.
Away away my love to where all darkness will be gone.
Away away to our land.
Where you will be forever in my arms again.
Days of dust, of cruelty and death.
Broke his soul until there was nothing left.
Only her love that carried him through all.
Away away my love to where all darkness will be gone.
Away away to our land.
Where you will be forever in my arms again.
He passed high mountains and rough rivers.
He wrote a thousand letters to be near.
He walked a thousand miles.
Just to see her smile again.
Just for returning home.
Away away my love to where all darkness will be gone.
Away away to our land.
Where you will be forever in my arms again.
Tell the wind I'll survive just to feel you again.
I will fight 'till the end to lay my promised love.
Forever in your hands.
