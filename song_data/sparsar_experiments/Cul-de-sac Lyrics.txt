Cul-de-sac Lyrics
by Pup.

Cul-De-Sac
Tough luck
You don't need me anymore
No, you don't
And, when my eyes were closed
You left me miserable
In the morning

I'll wait out the winter
In. This cul-de-sac
I still remember that summertime
By, the oceanside
You wrote me to let me know
You won't come back

And you're, right
I'll wait
And, your heart
Won't change

You were right
I. Will wait
And now your heart
Won't change

My love, won't change no
My whole life
I will wait
Now your heart
Won't change

My whole life
I will wait
For your heart to change
