Beyond Her Garden Lyrics
by WoodenToaster.


You try your best but it's not quite there.
You kick a hoof and say it's just not fair.
A simple mare living simple dreams.
A rumor that's not quite as it seems.

*Music*.

You try your best but it's not quite there.
You kick a hoof and say it's just not fair.
A simple mare living simple dreams.
A rumor that's not quite as it seems.

Carrot top, go beyond us.
You're a late star, time to fool us.
Keep your friends close, they're what drive you.
To the cosmos that describes you.

Brighter than tonight's sunset.
Can't mistake your silhouette.
Not a sound nor voice nearby.
Your mane illuminates this gloomy sky.

Carrot top, go beyond us.
You're a late star, time to fool us.
Keep your friends close, they're what drive you.
To the cosmos that describes you.
