Our Time Has Come Lyrics
by Wood.

Oh, when I come back tonight.
After working all day long.
The things that make it right.
Are the things that make it wrong.
So when we're forced to part.
I'm only half a man.
It's been a life of maybe's.
Oh, but now I know I can.
Our time has come, girl.
So long I've waited.
Our time has come, girl.
We're gonna take it.
Only now I notice things.
That for years I just ain't seen.
Was I walking in my sleep.
Oh, that's how that seemed to me.
So don't ask me to explain.
All the strange things that I do.
And I'm lucky you're in God.
Cause He's got to wait for you.
Our time has come, girl.
So long I've waited.
Our time has come, girl.
We're gonna take it.
Our time has come, girl.
So long I've waited.
Our time has come, girl.
We're gonna take it.
Our time has come, girl.
So long I've waited.
Our time has come, girl.
We're gonna take it.
Oh yeah.
