Die For Me Lyrics
by Angel Dust.

Twenty-one years of my life to go.
Have I lost myself to someone else?.
Truth, lie, to live or die.
Makes no difference if you're never gonna fuckin' try.
.
I know I'd die for you.
Feed off my sorrow.
.
I know I'd die for you.
Bleed for tomorrow.
.
Will you die for me?.
But will you die for me?.
.
See me standing, so fucking cool.
Wish you would be like me - a fool.
Truth, lie, to live or die.
Makes no difference, you're never gonna fuckin' try.
.
I know I'll die for you.
Feed off my sorrow.
.
I know I'll die for you.
Bleed for tomorrow.
.
I know I'll die for you.
Feed off my sorrow.
.
I know I'll die for you.
Can you feel it, can you see it, do you want me to.
.
Will you die for me?.
But will you die for me?.
.
I want you to....
I want you to....
I want you to....
I want you....
.
