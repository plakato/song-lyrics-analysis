Thuggin Ass Intro (Black Boy Fly) Lyrics
by Yung Trae.


Play this record as frequently as possible, then as it becomes easier for you.
Play the record once a day, or as needed.

Walkin' 'round with three guns, sippin' on Caprisuns.
Wait on college refunds, Adventure Time reruns.
In the morning comes the sun, hanging over my projects.
Where niggas slang dope, and debate on which projects.
Of mine could've billboard topped, Yo' but it's still more drops.
And chains for me to grind for, them shoes you wait in line for.
Them hoes I could never get, lies white as Brad Pitt to all the hoes I do have.

They keep me on my toes, Lauren called and told me she was over it.
I'm kinda not, but she barely even noticed it.
But took note of my fame that came in recent months.
She told me she was on some other shit, and keep in touch.
I got 99 problems, nigga she is one.
The other 98 is stresses that the game bring.
Old fans that want me talk about the same thing.
Like Where them hard bars? Don't say you've unhardened.
Just to become a rose in Madison Square's garden..
I'm on a quest for love; No Roots drummer.
Trynna get the game to welcome in this new comer.
With every tape; your focus is to do numbers.
With every tape; my focus is to inspire.
Kennedy Center shows, nigga we gettin' higher.
A black boy from where the black boys die.
That grew black wings, now watch this black boy fly, for real.
