Opium For My Soul Lyrics
by Rune.

Last night in my dreams... echoing in what seems.
The chambers of the sacred-.
Whispers that put me to sleep.
Twilight harvesting. Priests of navigation.
Persistent themes in incessant change.
The future's despair entangled.
In ancient past's long reign.
Lost is what we'll never know....
Grasp intellect of lost worlds.
The inquires of their unwanted.
The theories of their most maddened.
The shadows of their darkest rooms-.
Exposed in this release from reality.
Behold the oldest gods... and basking the glow.
And lying in the wake the scenery unfolds.
A mind marked by abstraction.
Harmony in the chaotic breath.
All times wind carried away my tonal.
Pictures that thought paints-.
What I can't shut out.
That would go ill with sleep.
Steals silence from the night.
Dreaming becomes an art.
Opium for my soul.
