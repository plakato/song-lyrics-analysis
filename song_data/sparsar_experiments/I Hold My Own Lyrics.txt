I Hold My Own Lyrics
by 50/50 Twin.


I hold my own, I ain't worried bout you.
M-O-E is what it is, when I do what I do.
Money over everything, except family and God.
Heater on my lap, swanging down the boulevard.

Trae.
I never knew that it would be later, but I'm living proof.
Fo' clips and a click of gorillas, can show the world the Truth.
So they say my attitude, is the reason I won't make it out Houston Texas.
I'm a Asshole to the death, huh better leave me in Houston Texas.
I ride for the one and only, Mr. Robert Davis.
Who A.K.A. the King of the H, so you niggas know who the greatest.
Don't make me watch what happened, it ain't no more doing no songs.
Until they give that at me touched, and I still feel like you in the wrong.
They better get back cause I'm back in the zone, I pack chrome blown no better.
give me my space.
Unless you wanna see em I get deep when I'm about to click, giving hands to.
your face.
Ain't too much, niggas done got me back to the corner ready to for the mail.
I wanna get to heaven, but right now I'm still creeping through hell.
That's why it's finna be drama, till the day that I decide.
That I'm sick of giving em drama, niggas gon learn.
A arrogant Asshole, can really be a problem to motherfuckers.
Empty the clip, and get to squabbing you motherfuckers for real.

Trae.
Don't get beside yourself nigga, unless you wanna suffer the consequence.
I promise you bout to get beat the fuck up, for trying to push your confidence.
The pain is a given, but still I choose to play it even against the odds.
I'ma be one to take the chance, put these niggas off in they place like broads.
Half of the time, it be the hate to make these niggas think they can try ya.
Till they see you bout your gangsta, now they ass scared to get by ya.
Gorillas don't play, even amongst eachother we gon be.
Fuck around and I call the coach, just watch how fast you lose your teeth.
I'm heated and on the daily, I wake up on the wrong side of the bed.
From what they said, off of my actions I'll be headed for dead.
It is what it is, no excuse and no apologizing.
Just dedication from the fuck-you finger, I'm emphasizing.
I'm A.B.N., I make my own rules to live the streets.
Ford and Berry got a problem, cause he done all that ain't gon stop the heat.
It's gonna be a ride, so it's best to buckle your belt together.
Fuck Sonny bitch, you about to witness some crucial weather.

50/50 Twin.
Hot days under the sun, voice meter pack guns.
Refusing to tuck my tail, turned me into a Don.
Many missions are to come, I feel like they won.
Me losing a fight ever, I recall one.
Northside to the South, real recognize real.
My words touch your gut, then you feel like I feel.
This S.L.A.B. and Roc-4-Roc, why stop cause a hater hate.
Camera on the bumper, peeping robbers as I navigate.
Agitate or eritate 50, is a no-no.
Leave your ass laying on the street, like a hobo.
Tipping on five fo's, one on the trunk.
Six 15's bump, make my rearview jump.
License plate not crooked, looking good gripping wood.
It's the same in every hood, time to eat and get full.
Hustle till I fall asleep, then I dream about money.
Money talk bullshit walk, you fronting.
