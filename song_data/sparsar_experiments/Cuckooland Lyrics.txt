Cuckooland Lyrics
by World Wide Message Tribe.

With all the cracks of justice shown.
It's clear to me the world's insane.
Where there's a glimpse of colour seen.
It fades away and turns to dreams.

Without you, my life means nothing.

I can feel something's wrong inside of me.
And I can see nothing's how it's meant to be.
And I can feel something special coming down on me.

With all the strains of time removed.
It's clear to see my life goes on.
And though my days seem rather small.
I realise I'll stay with you.
