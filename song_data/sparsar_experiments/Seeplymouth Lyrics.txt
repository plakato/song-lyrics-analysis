Seeplymouth Lyrics
by Volcano Choir.

Reflections of your love have come to wither.
I thought I'd done my best to realize.
A picture fades of you and I together.
I haven't come to terms with how we said goodbye.
Did you really care.
Care at all for me?
Did you really care.
Did you care at all for me?
A displaced little girl wept years in silence.
And whispered wishes you'd materialize.
She pressed on night and day to keep on living.
And tried so many ways to keep her soul alive.
Did you really care.
Care enough for me?
Did you really care.
Did you care at all for me?
If I'm not quite good enough.
Or somehow undeserving of a mother's love.
You could have had the decency to give me up.
Before you gave me life.
Don't you even care.
Just the slightest little bit for me.
Cause I really need to feel you cared.
Even once upon a time for me.
I need to believe.
In my heart of heart of hearts, you care for me.
I need to understand.
Why you left me there so helplessly.
Don't you even care.
Care at all for me?
Reflections of your love have come to wither.
I thought I'd done my best to memorize.
