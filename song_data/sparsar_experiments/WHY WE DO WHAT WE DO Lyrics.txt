WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO Lyrics

GAT TURNER:.

Why We Do What We Do.

I rhyme cuz I hurt, Man I rhyme out of pain, ----- Got me Dancing in the Dirt.
&amp; Got me Singing in the rain.

Man I rhyme out of love, I rhyme out of hate, ---- Sometimes I take a look.
above ask the Father ‘bout my Fate.

But He just make a nigga wait.

So I do's it ‘til its' done, un-til the battle's won, Guess I'll do it ‘til He.
come back.

I do it cuz I can, I do it for my fans &amp; sometimes they catch me in the.
street &amp; tell me “Gat u the man!”.

God your lyrics made me pray &amp; they made a nigga day.
They Say they be bringing back the track and be like, “what that nigga say”.

Your lyrics made a nigga cry and made a nigga try.
That's why I do it for the people and I'll do it til I die.

I don't do it cuz I'm broke, I don't do it cuz I'm folks… I do's it, cuz it's.
the only way I know to cope.

&amp;I do it ‘cuz otherwise a nigga would be worthless.

When u makin history /it seriously should be documented / so when we spit it/.
its like verbal hieroglyphics / we do it for the lil bboys / bad likea buncha Bruce.
Leroys /.
ina cipher afterschool droppin freestyle jewels/ this for the.
intellectual few and the straight up fools/ we do it for the profile victims.

innocent stereotyped children of the matrix/ occupy tha vacant try to not say shit/ when.
other muthafuckas wanna judge you / don't let it budge you/ now we move smarter /.
cuz we fathers/ we do this for our legacy /for real we ridin dirty cuz we.
ain't scared of no felonies /what is u tellin me /if it ain't the truth/ its still.
each one teach one that's what we enforce to the youth. Its why we do what we do w/.
this miracle experience/ u might call it life /its the reason why we write.
/ that's.
why we do what we do 2x.
