Scorpions in My Pocket Lyrics
by XJ Jack.


I've got scorpions in my pocket.
The ones that i counted as friends.
The ones that hurt me back to back.
The ones that i cared about the most.

I've got scorpions in my pocket.
The ones that i counted as friends.

The ones that i counted as friends.
The ones that hurt me back to back.
The ones that stabbed me in my back.
Scorpions in My Pocket.

I've got scorpions in my pocket.
The ones that i counted as friends.
The ones that i'm about to smack.
The ones that love to hold me back.
I'm venomous like a scorpion.
I can sting you slowly.
Don't make me lose myself.
I'm only here for those who care about me.
I've got scorpions in my pocket.
The ones that i counted as friends.
The ones that hurt me back to back.
The ones that stabbed me in my back.

Scorpions in My Pocket.
Huh, Huh.
Scorpions in My Pocket.
Huh, Huh.
Scorpions in My Pocket.
Huh.
Scorpion.

I've got scorpions in my pocket.
The ones that i counted as friends.
The ones that i'm about to smack.
The ones that love to hold me back.
I'm venomous like a scorpion.
I can sting you slowly.
Don't make me lose myself.
I'm only here for those who care about me.
I've got scorpions in my pocket.
The ones that i counted as friends.
The ones that hurt me back to back.
The ones that stabbed me in my back.

Ah, ah.
Ah, Ah.

The ones that i counted as friends.
The ones that hurt me back to back.
The ones that stabbed me in my back.

Scorpion.

I've got scorpions in my pocket.
The ones that i counted as friends.
The ones that hurt me back to back.
The ones that i cared about the most.
I've got scorpions in my pocket.
The ones that i counted as friends.
