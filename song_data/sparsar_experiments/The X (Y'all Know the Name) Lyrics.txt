The X (Y'all Know the Name) Lyrics
by The X-Ecutioners.

Uh..uh..uh..baby!

{*scratched*}.
X-Ecutioners Ya..ya..y'all know the name.
Stabbin the track with both hands.
X-Ecutioners Ya..ya..y'all know the name.
Louder!!
X-Ecutioners Ya..ya..y'all know the name.
Stabbin the track with both hands.
X-Ecutioners Ya..ya..y'all know the name.
You out there? Louder!

Pharaohe Monch.
This is masterful, classical, material wax, imperial tactics.
Black shit I master, traps that collapse backwards.
All area access, passes without practice.
Hit em, then I'ma shit on em and spit on em, and send faxes.
Maximum amount  not the minimal.
The oratal rock chop like Florida Seminole.
Subliminal raps which make criminals act bitch.
Instrumental in creatin the most pinnacle rap shit.
Got Toni Braxton lookin women collapsin.
My beats get feet to steppin like Fast Actin Tinactin.
Dominant X-Men conference like Pac-10.
Backslap wack rap actors to get a reaction.
My venom rips tennaments up then I'ma wreck shit.
Then I'ma flip, administer hits on this next shit.
Deejays collect tips from them then hit the exit.
At they show the front row, usually gettin hectic.
The X shit....

{*scratched*}.
Ya..ya..y'all know the name X-Ecutioners.
Stabbin the track with both hands.. together.
The fall.. you out there? Louder!
X-Ecutioners Ya..ya..y'all know the name.
Stabbin the track with both hands.. together.
The fall forever gon' win.. you out there?

Xzibit.
Yeah yo, uh-huh, yeah, check it.
You wanna get to my level but you don't hustle enough.
Any attempts at touchin my stuff and I'm fuckin you up.
I'm sick of weak shit winnin, nigga yo' rhymes ain't rockin.
The good life is a bitch, seem like everybody cop blockin.
The shotclock is runnin out, gunnin out the police.
I crack the teeth of any nigga with beef.
Masterpiece, X-Ecutioners, naturally.
Any problems, come to Los Angeles and ask for me.

Inspectah Deck.
Yo castastrophe, none can match me, naturally nasty.
Manually smash ya faculty.
Veral assault and battery.
Sparatically blast at the capacity crowd and cause casualties.
Street savy, niggas blast me out the Navi'.
Groupie chick wish she could have me.
XE in back of me, hit like a daquiri.
Accurately, ya don't grab me, ya skills still latchkey.

{*scratched*}.
Ya..ya..y'all know the name X-Ecutioners.
Stabbin the track with both hands.. together.
The fall.. you out there? Louder!
X-Ecutioners Stabbin the track.....the track.
.....with both hands.

Skillz.
I got my man Roc Raida on the slash and cut.
Rob Swift where you at son, the What What.
Sinister make em - now we ready to go.
Last but not least, total eclipse.
I got a question, who can see him? I don't know.
But whatever I play, you know that Skillz gon' flow.
Shit we mastered the feat, you can't bring us.
Y'all could crap if y'all was doin that shit with eight fingers.
Come on black, we in the Hall of Fame.
Got ya picture in our crib on the Wall of Shame.
I expect emcees to wanna murder me.
Cuz when we open up and start cuttin, you wish you was in surgery.
You see the X? Hardly.
Here's some on-offs nigga take yo' ass back to doin parties.
You're better off if somebody shoot ya.
And change ya name to DJ I-Got-Beat-By-The-X-Ecutioners.

{*scratched*}.
Ya..ya..y'all know the name X-Ecutioners.
Stabbin the track with both hands.. together.
The fall.. you out there? Fifty thou in the stands.
X-Ecutioners Ya..ya..y'all know the name.
Stabbin the track with both hands.. together.
The fall.. forever gon' win You out there? Louder!
Y'all know the name.

*Redman's vocal dog barking*.
