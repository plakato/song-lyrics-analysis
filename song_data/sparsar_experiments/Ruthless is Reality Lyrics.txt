Ruthless is Reality Lyrics
by 415.

D-Loc.
Step aside, fly, D-Loc's got a posse.
I'm in the house with the young Brotha Broski.
Along with me is Icee B.
And my homie Dubble-R makes the shit complete.
Today we got a message that we wanna kick.
It's legit but on the ruthless tip.
So like this, in the place to be.

Brotha Broski.
Walkin through the streets.
The crime rate still stands to be, held in a cell with no release.
Seven counts of crime, the prime suspect.
Dialect identifies a brother, that's with lyrics.
But those that oppose to this, then immediately.
Pump a muthafucka just to prove I'm soon to be.
The leader, so follow the proceedures of thee.
Impossible, unstoppable, undefeatable Brotha Broski.
Is runnin and gunnin suckers down, well, let me catch my breath.
Because you ain't heard nothin yet.
You know I'ma blow because I ain't no joke.
Proceed with caution when approachin a criminal.
I'm strictly equipped, the vocab is kept stunnin.
Many words will impress, huh, so yo, I keep em comin.
As I step out with the bailor, move towards the door.
Slammin behind me, Yo man, what you in for?
A murder beef, see? And that oughta prove to any fool.
Don't step up - and that goes for you.
Be true to the game and the game will be true to you.
Man, I ain't playin, I'm with the ruthless school.
See, it's simple and plain, no need for me to deny, you see.
Face the facts that ruthless is reality.

-- Dr. Dre.
Ruthless is reality.

D-Loc.
Hey yo, my main man Dubble-R - step to em, man.

Richie Rich.
It's a late night, and everybody's asleep.
But me, because I'm tryin to creep.
I got a family to feed and a wife that's bitchin.
The house to the right, the window and the kitchen.
I'm in there, I'm movin quiet as fuck.
Hammer's back on my Magnum cause I'm pressin my luck.
It's just a burglary, man, you know, I'm doin this.
And willin to kill anyone who tries to ruin this.
I need cash, that's what I'm talkin about.
I hear the noise upstairs, so it's time to break out.
Plan 1 is out, Plan 2 in effect.
The big bank job to get the pockets correct.
A devilish scheme to get money and I mean it.
A cold-ass plan and boy, you shoulda seen it.
Ruthless shit from the gats to the outfits.
Somethin could go wrong, but nigga, I doubt this.
AK's ready, maps on the floor.
Loc's got the fuse, 'bout to blow the door.
As soon as we get inside we're shootin whatever moves.
We're gettin money, we've got no time to lose.
Blow the door - damn, the place is empty.
Right on time and the shit's startin to tempt me.
Safe hella fat but I brought the locksmith.
Alarm wires cut so like nothin could stop this.

Van doors open and hustlers stackin.
Way too much money for a couple of youths.
Put together tight by a villain on the loose.
415 is a code you must fess to.
And if you don't, I hope you brought your vest through.
Cause brothers get busy when it comes to technicalities.
It's like this: ruthless is reality.

-- Dr. Dre.
Ruthless is reality.

D-Loc.
Icee B, drop that dope shit.

Icee B.
Never backin down from a punk cause I'm a villain.
Not afraid to kill, I created the word 'killing'.
Bein ruthless is the way that I'm comin up.
Not goin to jail, and if I do, I don't give a fuck.
Sneakin up on ya like a thief in the night.
Never givin a fuck about a sucker, I ain't the soft type.
So run up or shut up, boy, see, that's what I'm sayin.
I put the clip in the Uzi and commence the sprayin.
Like a smooth operator that operates smoothly.
Don't try to hit me, boy, you can't bruise me.
I'm a leader, so start followin me.
Numero uno, the one they call Icee B.
Young gangster by the age of 15.
You wanna battle me? You must be a dopefiend.
Smokin and chokin on the rhymes that are dope and.
The ones I be fuckin up be wishin and hopin.
Prayin that Icee B will go legit, go legit.
And quit the ruthless style, yo, that's bullshit.
And to the punk police who try to stop me.
I'm killin and whoopin they ass cause ruthless is reality.

Ruthless is reality.
-- Dr. Dre.
Ruthless is reality.
Ruthless is reality.

Richie Rich.
Yo Icee B, that was tight.
But now it's time for my main man the L-o-c to step to the mic.
Yo Loc - step up in and show em what time it is.

Ruthless is reality.

D-Loc.
Comin from the one man Rambo.
Here's an example of the way that I'm livin in the big O.
Wanted by the punk police for at least 4.
Murders or more, simply because I takes no shorts.
I refuse to be caught loose and ridiculed.
Who's to choose to disturb the groove I use?
Delusions of madness, I psychologically get pissed.
When a sucker confronts me for goin ruthless.
That's the way that I know, so I go for mine.
First I lay low, and then yo, I commit the crime.
Wipe the finger prints, leavin no single hint or a clue.
To what the fuck I just pursued.
Some call it robbery, but shit, it takes care of me.
Life ain't easy, man, and this ain't the Cosby's.
I do what it takes to get paid in this day and age.
Nobody gives a damn or lends me a helping hand.
So don't sweat me, I'm doin exactly.
The same as the other  if he was in my position.
Never downgrade another brother, just love him, see.
Cause all the fuck that I'm sayin, man, is ruthless is reality.

-- Dr. Dre.
Ruthless is reality.
