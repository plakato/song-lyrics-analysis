Don't Take Your Joy Lyrics
by Virtue.


I was wrong, I'll be the first to admit.
I wasn't strong, at times I wanted to quit.
I let You down and I know that it ain't right.
But living without You I can see.
That life just can't be for me.

Walking around trying to play the part.
Down inside no one could see my broken heart.
Feeling like I'm bound, but I really wanna be free.
What I'm really trying to say is that.
You can't take Your joy from me.

Don't take your joy from me.
Without it where would I be?
Like a ship tossed and driven.
No reason for living;.
Don't take it away.
Don't take it away.

Your joy is my strength I know.
Without it I don't even know where would I go?
Now I understand what You really mean to me.
They can say what they want to say.
But I'm gona keep on loving You this way.

They say you don't miss your water.
'til your well runs dry.
Well I'm sure enough missing You.
I ain't gonna tell no more lie.
I wanna come home, would You please let me in;.
I'm really trying' to make You see.
I want to start over again.

Without You no joy, no.
No life, no reason to live;.
And I give all that I am.
So do what You want to.
What I'm really trying to say is.
Don't take Your joy away.

Vamp:.
Don't take it away.
Don't take it away.
Don't take it away.
Don't take it away.

Don't take it away.
Don't take it away.
Don't take it away.
Don't take it away.
