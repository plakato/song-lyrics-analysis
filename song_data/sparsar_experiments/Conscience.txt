Conscience
by The Swellers.

Hey, do you remember me?
Fuel from the will has never run so well.
When all the assholes follow suit.
This is my defense; it just makes more sense.
To do less than one is doing now.
Will do more for a goal.
Than anyone can stomach giving up.
Reiterate it one more time.
I'm nothing.

I feel responsibility to say whats on my mind.
This is more than a dream.
Get shit on to give a shit.
The least American.
The new minority.

Then theres you, the pointer boy for truths.
A spark can start it all.
Without your doubt, theres not much we can't do.
Reiterate it one more time.
I'm nothing, I'm nothing.

Find comfort in fiction.
Your story has been incomplete all along.
How safe do you feel with your mind closed?
