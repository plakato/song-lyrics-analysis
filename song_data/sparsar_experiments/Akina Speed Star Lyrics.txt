Akina Speed Star Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.


You can leave it up to me to never fail or cease to switch it up. 
I'M still smoking plenty, blunts, 
Some say it's too many blunts 
Don't catch me out here: eatin' lunchs, then after that gon' see me, hunt 
Pull up S13 and pop my hood and let my trunk thump 
Ridin' through the hood I bump. The thump from trunk will shake you up
 
Pull up to the party sparked 
Your girl, see me and save a spot. 
She know. I know what I want 
She wondering if she, the one 
But I ain't gon' start nothing. 
My energy is for the hustle 
She say she can deal with that 
But. She still want it from the back. 
I might slide that wacky pack, like Sonic, then be out of that 
Pull up smoking, jumpin' jacks 
The smell of that, would lay you back 
She drink. Just like Lahey, but I'm Ricky when I smoke a sack 
Pull off with them, handles man. 
2 40 slide up to the pack, 
K-A no SR you bitch 
Watch, how I make these niggas mad 
He pull off. He looking sad 
Switch back to me. I fill my glass 
Clowns can't get down with us. No rappers can come damage us 
He come with that tricky shit, 
We, quick and first to handle it. 
I can't give a fuck for shit 
It's Hollow Squad or nothing. You bitch
