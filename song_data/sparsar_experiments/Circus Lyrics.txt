Circus Lyrics
by 600Breezy.


Oh that's your bitch on me.
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her.
Oh that's your bitch, you can keep her.
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her.
Are you cuffing? Am I cursing?
Why you look like I make you nervous?
She for the gang, which one you working?
Baby, go buy you a car and join the circus.

Breezy what you doing? Smoking reefer.
That ratchet ass bitch, yeah you can keep her.
This pistol on my hip just like a beeper.
And I ride around with this sweeper.
Why you looking nervous?
The five on my hip, I'm tryna burn some.
You steady cuffing hoes, you ain't gon' learn none.
And plus we piped in this bitch, we might turn some.
Green vision, 600.
You ain't got no money, 100 in my tomma.
There gon' be no fucking don me, you niggas looking bombing.
Ain't got no job like Tommy, you niggas steal it with your mommy, that hoe you.
cuff ain't nothing.

Oh that's your bitch on me.
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her.
Oh that's your bitch, you can keep her.
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her.
Are you cuffing? Am I cursing?
Why you look like I make you nervous?
She for the gang, which one you working?
Baby, go buy you a car and join the circus.

Molly Murk, bet your bitch know me.
Ask me was I cuffing, I told her to call the police.
Bitch I'm 100 so I don't fuck with 5 O.
Bitch don't look like nothing, I wouldn't hit her with a tide hoe.
Bitch demonstration, 2 tries, that's a free throw.
? hol' up, bitch ass on with Breezo.
Riding up, them bullets hurt, just like casino.
Ran off on the plug twice, bitch give me burritos.
Ass feel like plastic, I got my raw bone.
Fire up the blunt, that smell up the ozone.
Get the bed rocking, your shit gon' get postponed.
600 green vision, that's all sold on.

Oh that's your bitch on me.
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her.
Oh that's your bitch, you can keep her.
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her.
Are you cuffing? Am I cursing?
Why you look like I make you nervous?
She for the gang, which one you working?
Baby, go buy you a car and join the circus.
