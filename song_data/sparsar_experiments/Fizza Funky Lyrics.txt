Fizza Funky Lyrics
by 60 Second Assassin.


Uhh, fizza fizza funky for you.
Fizza funky for you.
Fizza funky for you.

60 Second Assassin.
Make way, new year brand new day.
Ain't nothing but some more hell to raise.
With a whole lot to say, same ol' saying.
Medina Warriors coming out to play, 7 24 365 days.
Now I'mma make the song sing from East to West side.
Spread my wings, then ride from Attica to Sing Sing.
Like Freddy, I'm in your wildest dreams.
Nightmare on 60 Street,.
Seconds from the Assassin's reach.
Cast through your doors and see you as an I.E.
Tried the chief, warcloud's any cocked from the strong isle.
Architect at it's best, mathematician of heart that's soft.
Rap Meyer Lansky.

60 Second Assassin.
I'mma keep it fizza fizza funky for ya.
Fizza, fizza funky for ya, cuz I ain't playing.
I'mma keep it fizza fizza funky for ya.
Fizza, fizza funky for ya, cuz I ain't playing.

60 Second Assassin.
I pissed of the rent, I write with a garlic pen.
I carved the men, on the paper is that ink of a scholar man.
Versus the mighty dollar, damn.
Police gain another collared man.
That if told right, could win a damn oscar, man.
Win, lose or draw, I'mma break you off proper, man.
Like surgery, lyrics incision, like a doctor.
Study music deeply from acapella to opera.
Come get a kick out of this, like some soccer.
Action saga, ask your Shop of Horror.
60 Second Assassin through the microphone blasting.
Ain't trying to get to this, you know the half it.
Busting ass and taking notes, I know who crashed in.
Shopped on both sides of the graze cuz I'mma craftsman.

60 Second Assassin.
Hip hop's critically proclaimed, ordained.
I'mma take you through the hall of fame, it ain't hard to tell.
History, the makings, for fake MC's to smell.
Seek from oceans, history in my own time about to open.
Along with great chapters on forgotten potion.
Ya'll can't see me, how would you ever notice?
When only one has the key to open, the other side.
Just a notion, picked from the All Eye.
Looking for a being, a closed eye ain't made for seeing.
I get in where I fit in.
Nah, this ain't religion or like Marvin Gaye, this ain't living.
Thirty years, another mind lays in prison.
It's not a game, I'mma kill all the small talk.
Begin to open up New York, cuz I walk that walk.
With a double edged that's qualified to talk that talk.
In the streets of New York, a triple O.G.
So you know it's me, terrorizing the street.
Bring it back to them old hits, cold turkey off that new bullshit.
What ya'll thought, I would quit? I'm the ace.
You must be crazier than a barrel of cocky eyed rattlesnakes.
Here's for you, one back atcha, to your face.

All over the world, the grass grow green.
All over the world, blue skies are seen.
All over the world, are children too.
Who just want to laugh or be friends with you.
All over the world, will lead you soon....
