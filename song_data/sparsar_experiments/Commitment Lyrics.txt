Commitment Lyrics
by Sy Ari Da Kid.


Hello?
Hey..
What you wanna talk about?
I mean Ion think thats not a good idea, you already know my situation.

Aye, maybe im trippin, maybe im afraid of commitment.
Maybe im afraid of the tought.
of spending my whole life with the same one women.
And everyday something different I can't keep slayin' them bitches and some.
people say I'm addicted.
But If it ain't what it isn't  but anyway it been a minute.
So we hang and we kicked it, we maintain at a distance you done change on a niqqa.
Don't change on me  I feel like we playing games girl..

I feel like we playing games girl.
Talk to me.
Talk to me just talk to me  used to argue on this phone are you on?
But If I pull up on you the look in your eyes you can't tell me no.

Can't save you're ass, don't make a niqqa hate your ass.
Got me asking these questions like how you get bae so fast, can erase you're pass.
Aye ima let you meditate on that, now what's your take on that ima wait on.
that aye.
Nevermind that's time wasted im tired of taking these chances baby you violate.
that's a violation.

I feel like we playing games girl.
Talk to me.
Talk to me just talk to me.
Used to argue on this phone are you on?
But If I pull up on you the look in your eyes you can't tell me no.

I feel like you just in youre feelings I feel like I should handle feelings.
And baby ima make you feel it.
A real niqqas gone feel me.
You know my woman gon feel this.

Talk to me.
Talk to me just talk to me  used to argue on this phone are you on?
But If I pull up on you the look in your eyes you can't tell me no.
Talk to me, talk to me just talk to me  used to argue on this phone are.
you on?
But If I pull up on you the look in your eyes, you can't tell me no.

Just talk,  just talk to me.
you can't tell me no.
