Phenomenal Freestyle Lyrics
by Sycosis.

I told these niggas I'm phenomenal/.
Now they hoping that I come back like Obama do/.
I heard that shit that you talk about me Mitt Romeny/.
But 47 percent of it don't harm me/.
Why would it when you're amazing/.
Coupe black and yellow they calling it half Asian/.
Dodge every shot that they take like I'm half agent/.
You know Neo, blucka blucka reload/.
16 bars of bullets you swiss cheese ho/.
But I could use some Swizz Beatz though/.
Or maybe stop by Young Chop/.

2 Chainz on a feature I'd be famous on the spot/.
My shit would sell out the stores/.
Niggas sell half they soul just to sell out for sure/.
But naw I ain't with it I ain't with it/.
These niggas just rapping they ain't live it they ain't live it/.
My prime like a dime minus nine, I ain't hit/.
And all the dumb niggas like, I ain't get it/.
We know...

Stop playing with them like a kid on punishment/.
I run this shit actually, facutually/.
So naturally you gotta come after me/.
Defy the laws of gravity, fold both legs and fly to the sky rapidly.
/.
Punch a nigga through his chest, remove his breast cavity/.
Right through the center, pull out his heart for diner/.
Remember I run the underground like Master Splinter/.
Still trying to make it back like D. Rose/.
But these niggas still cheating the game like Pete Rose/.
Fully clothed feeling naked in this motherfucka/.
One day we gonna make it in this motherfucka/.
My little brother doing time/.
We all got a job nigga I'm just doing mine/.
My lil sister man bout to have a baby/.
And my moma ass about to go crazy/.
I'm just praying somehow we make it out/.
Chains on ya mind I'm just trying to break you out/.
If only you could think lil nigga/.
The State's Attorney got the kitchen sink lil nigga/.
And he will throw it at you/.
Cleats on these beats man I run the track faster/.
Bolt style, I fit the.
profile/.
S-Y the killer put your money on the dealer/.
Bets on the house man I'm streteched on the couch/.
Half a fith of rum for this stress and these doubts/.
Make it out...

We all been through a lot/.
That ain't no excuse for ya ass to stop/.
From the bottom to the top/.
Until the moon or sun drop/.
Fuck if your album flop/.
Be a man even if you didn't have a pops.
