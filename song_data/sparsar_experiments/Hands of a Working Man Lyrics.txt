Hands of a Working Man Lyrics
by Ty Herndon.


At the local diner just outside of town.
He comes in an hour early just to beat the morning crowd.
He stares out the window and stirs his coffee cup.
Another day, another dollar short of catchin up.

Same old job and same old dull routine.
But in his heart he knows what it brings.
A two bedroom house for his family of three.
He's givin' his all, making ends meet.
A secondhand car, a washing machine.
They may not have much, but he gets what they need.
With the hands of a working man.

Down at the factory, standing in line.
He waits to punch the time clock, a million worries on his mind.
Oh, Jimmy's needing braces and Betty's needing time.
And the problems that he's facing, they're all building up inside.
