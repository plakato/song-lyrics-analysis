Into The Mystic Lyrics
by The Swell Season.

We were born before the wind.
And we're so much younger than the sun.
Ere the bonnie boat was won.
As we sailed into the mystic.

Hark, now hear the sailors cry.
Feel the sea and touch the sky.
And let your soul and your spirit fly.
As we sailed into the mystic.

And when that fog horn blows.
You know I will be coming home.
And when that fog horn whistle blows.
I want to hear it.
I don't have to fear it.

I want to rock your gypsy soul.
Just like way back in those days of old.
Then together we will fall.
As we sail into the mystic.

Cause we were born before the wind.
And we're so much younger than the sun.
Ere the bonnie boat was won.
As we sailed into the mystic.

Hark, now hear the sailors cry.
Feel the sea and touch the sky.
And let your soul and your spirit fly.
As we sailed into the mystic.

And when that fog horn blows.
You know I will be coming home.
And when that fog horn whistle blows.
I want to hear it.
I don't have to fear it.

I want to rock your gypsy soul.
Just like way back in those days of old.
And magnificently we will fall.
As we sail into the mystic.
