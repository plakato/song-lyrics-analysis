It's Nothin' Lyrics
by 50/50 Twin.


The cars the jewelry, the clothes.
The Prada the platinum, the Rovers.
The mansions the jets, the dro.
Everything under the sun, is old.
Shootouts cooking soft, punching laws.
Kappa Beach Daytona, Source Awards.
High rise beach house, cuban cigars.
Everything under the sun, is old.

50/50 Twin.
One plus one, equals two.
Me plus her equals screw, 50 cop fur when it's cool.
Chinchillas women wear, for the pool.
And I drop the Ja, I rule.
I'm like 50 Pacs not two, boy cold from sick ha-choo.
Ask myself a question, why I do.
Punk pussy rappers, try you pip squeak.
Last one and not two, 50 a gorilla out the zoo.
Foul me like free throw shots, I shoot.
Plus I clap shots, at y'all crew.
Give a round of applause, at y'all dudes.
My brother on lock, that's why I do what I do, jeah.

50/50 Twin.
BMW jet skis, wearing no life jacket.
You better get your ring back, I'm with your wife faggot.
What if I had a disease, a chance you might have it.
She told me you never show her, a romantic night daddy.
That slanted white Caddy, on them swangas.
No smoking in that daddy, the seats are panda.
J-Lo get back at me, I'll make you famous.
At that flow and that rapping, you can't contain me.
Christian D.R. for her, but not for him.
You dudes wearing girl glasses, they're not for men.
All you women smoking cigarettes, you're not for Twin.
Hypnotic for me, you drinking Smirnoff again.
I burn off in the Benz, switch cars and come back.
I might buy a spaceship, hit Mars and come back.
A trip at all, so I bet y'all didn't know that.
I'm in a throw-ahead jersey, y'all still in throwbacks.

50/50 Twin.
My life ain't no sad song, hold the violence.
Big pimp smash, bad hoes on the island.
Big limp walk passed, toes covered Prada.
Big chips Frito Lays, Cheetoes can't top em.
My bank account's stuffed, 6 zeros it got em.
Me saying I'm broke, same as playing possom.
Done got you all the fight money, talk I ain't squabbling.
If I do HBO time, I ain't dropping.
Mama got a pink Lamborghini, and it's rocking.
Drop your c.d. same day as me, and it's flopping.
Drug deal in Toronto, watching nice hockey.
I turn heads walking, nigga the girls gon watch me.
50/50 big man, holla at papi.
If you wanna learn to be cocky, step back and watch me.

Like I said, all the above it's nothing.
