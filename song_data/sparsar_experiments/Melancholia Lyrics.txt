Melancholia Lyrics
by XJ Jack.


It feels like a hundred years.
When i know i lost you just now.
It seems like there was No Religion.
You were my only true ambition.

I'm losing sleep again.
It's now just an ordinary day.
I want to touch your reflection.
Breathe you in.
Why would you leave so soon?

There is no point for a search for a reason.
I am lost in this cold change of season.
You lost your faith, in just a day.
It's an ordinary day.
I am lost in this cold change of season.

Breathe me in.
