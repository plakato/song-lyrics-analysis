Vanessa Lyrics
by Univore.

You was a pretty little girl.
You was the girl I'm suppoesed to marry.
You know we met in Cincinatti.
You was a fascinating lady.

Oh, but what can I do about it?
There's just one thing that we've got to do.
We're meant to be together.
We were supposed to be united.

Vanessa, I think we're naturally ?
?
Vanessa, you really mean much to me.
?
Vanessa,  ?
? under the stars.
Under the stars. Vanessa.

I tried to find you on computer.
I want to see if you was married.
To see if you in Cincinatti.
To see if you had got some marriage.

Oh, but what can I do about it.
There's just one thing that we've got to do.
We're meant to be together.
We were supposed to be united.

I was hanging out with Tommy.
He said that you and Jake got married.
He said you'd moved to Kansas city.
But you ain't got no ?

Oh, but what can I do about it.
There's just one thing we've got to do.
We've got to be together.
We were supposed to be united.

Vanessa.
Vanessa.
Vanessa.
Vanessa.
