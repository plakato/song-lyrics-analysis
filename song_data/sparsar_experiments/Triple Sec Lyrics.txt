Triple Sec Lyrics
by 415 fossas.


Living in the womb splitting into two 
 
Oh shit: wait a sec theres, another Jew, 
 
Listen. Here bitch. This will be you tomb, 
, 
This, place ain't big enough. Betta make some room 
, 
Gettin fumed your life is doomed, 
, 
Your body mangled, never be exhumed. 
 
Now for your final plot, needa kill ya in one shot. 
 
No weapons are near. It became very clear. 
 
I'll kill you with an erect spear 
 
Like jake sweeny as Y.B.F 
 
Killed this bitch. Now he deaf 
 
Get it A dick through the ear bass, clef 
 
Now. What to say when I get out i'll, surely pay 
 
I got it! That boy was gay, 
 
Ain't even born yet, and my life already grey 
 
Atleast. I get to live another day: 
 
No room for triplets, only twins, 
 
Please. Forgive me for my sins 
 
Surrounded by demented grins, 
 
Guess. My punishment begins: 
 
, Diego Johnson aka Dave 
 
Here comes that faggot fetus Dave 
 
Coming back from the fucking grave 
 
Thought. You could kill me like in Murder. She Wrote 
 
I'll, kill you with an erect spear. Quote-Unquote 
 
Bitch. I'Ve fit much bigger things down. My fucking throat 
 
I spent my time. Hangin in hell. Hung out with that boy, with horns of a goat, 
 
That's Satan bitch he's my adopted father 
 
666 on my dick bitch. U tryna see don't fuckin bother 
 
Cuz. My cock is covered in crap and the remnants of fap 
 
I dress up as a Succubus, but its just a trap. 
 
Get those boys inside my gap, then its a wrap, 
 
Cuz. I make them gay. Welcome to Hell old, chap 
 
Now, I'm coming for you, you dirty Jew, 
 
Time to Green Day, you. Turn your cranium into Brain Stew, 
 
Welcome to Hell brother. I'M delighted that you're sighted 
 
Time for revenge. We've been reunited. My dick is ignited and your ass will
be delighted, 
 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, 
 
No room for tripletts, only twins, 
 
Please. Forgive me for my sins 
 
Surrounded by demented grins, 
 
Guess. My punishment begins: 
 
Skit,
