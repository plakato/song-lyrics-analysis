Triple Sec Lyrics
by 415 fossas.


Living in the womb, splitting into two.

Oh shit wait a sec, theres another Jew.

Listen here bitch, this will be you tomb.

This place ain't big enough, betta make some room.

Gettin fumed, your life is doomed.

Your body mangled, never be exhumed.

Now for your final plot, needa kill ya in one shot.

No weapons are near, it became very clear.

I'll kill you with an erect spear.

Like jake sweeny as Y.B.F.

Killed this bitch, now he deaf.

Get it? A dick through the ear, bass clef.

Now what to say? when I get out, i'll surely pay.

I got it!, that boy was gay.

Ain't even born yet, and my life already grey.

Atleast I get to live another day.

No room for triplets only twins.

Please forgive me for my sins.

Surrounded by demented grins.

Guess my punishment begins.

Diego Johnson aka Dave.

Here comes that faggot fetus Dave.

Coming back from the fucking grave.

Thought you could kill me like in Murder She Wrote.

I'll kill you with an erect spear. Quote-Unquote.

Bitch I've fit much bigger things down my fucking throat.

I spent my time hangin in hell. Hung out with that boy with horns of a goat.

That's Satan bitch he's my adopted father.

666 on my dick bitch u tryna see don't fuckin bother.

Cuz my cock is covered in crap and the remnants of fap.

I dress up as a Succubus but its just a trap.

Get those boys inside my gap then its a wrap.

Cuz I make them gay. Welcome to Hell old chap.

Now I'm coming for you you dirty Jew.

Time to Green Day you. Turn your cranium into Brain Stew!

Welcome to Hell brother! I'm delighted that you're sighted.

Time for revenge. We've been reunited, my dick is ignited, and your ass will.
be delighted!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

No room for tripletts only twins.

Please forgive me for my sins.

Surrounded by demented grins.

Guess my punishment begins.

Skit.
