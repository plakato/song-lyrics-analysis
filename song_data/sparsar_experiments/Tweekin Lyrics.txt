Tweekin Lyrics
by V-Nasty.


Everytime I go outside I'm tweakin'.
Oh.

I might pop a molly, I might pop a xan.
I might pop a nigga, then I'll pop his mans.
Got the .40 in my fuckin' hand.
Make that nigga do the runnin' man.

Everywhere I go, niggas say I'm tweakin.
I just be smokin , chiefin'.
Everywere I go, them niggas say I'm tweakin'.
I just be livin', you sleepin'.

I just caught a body like last night.
That boy was a cut, that was his last life.
Already got two this is my last strike.
They say that I be tweakin' off that glass pipe.

Kill a nigga for no reason - like a homicide.
Anytime I come through, them niggas know its drama time.
2-2-3's that's choppa time.
Fuck with me, you traumatized.
I'm paranoid like Dolla Sign.
I'm paranoid like Dolla Sign!

Who the fuck you think it was?
My name V-Nasty, I need the drugs.
I catch a body, I show no love.
I'm from the streets where times get tough.

Got enough so I share my plate.
Fuck them niggas that wanna hate, I'm grinding like I'm number 8.
I'm movin' bricks, like state to state.
Get them bitches up out the way.
?
Boy you know I'm tweekin', ho.
?
