Talk My Shit Lyrics
by The Wow.

KO THE LEGEND &amp; DJ Wonder.

Follow the movement.
Talk my shit.

KO THE LEGEND.

Look.
Straight from the abyss.
KO going apes.
Im in the midst.
Getty told me to score.
I waited for the assist.
Half-court shot my nigga.
Swish.
I see MC's jealous.
Ive been behind hard bars for years.
Committing felonies.
Never listen to what industry niggas tellin me.
Never buying dreams that labels be tryna sell to me.
Keep smoking because Im too fire.
I deserve the crown.
Call me the new sire.
In the fast lane homey I cruise by ya.
You Ducati, Im Bugatti.
You too tired.
Im four wheelin.
I came here to restore feelin.
I murk tracks.
And I plan on doing some more killin.
And lord willin.
Im straight to the top it.
You a lie.
And Im the mother fucking opposite.
Cause Im the truth.
Ask around if you need proof.
Spit fire when Im in the booth.
Im gonna continue to grind til Im rich.
As a Maloof.
Or even richer.
You ain't seeing the big picture.
If I ain't come up around ya.
Im never seen with ya.
We get money and divvy up the loot.
Messsin with us is a trivial pursuit.
And we don't play that.

Follow the movement.
Number one, I don't have to assume it.
Talk my shit.

KO THE LEGEND.
A hundred dollar conversation with a millionaire.
California kush, the aroma in the air.
They tell me Giacomorelli's.
I should get a pair.
But I ain't got that kinda paper this shit isn't fair.
But fuck it I deserve the opulence.
They know it too so they throwing a nigga compliments.
Foreign documents.
Concerts on other continents.
Got a nigga ego bigger than a fucking monument.
They hear him but they don't feel him.
Give me the keys to the game or Im gonna steal em.
When you tryin to make a name you gotta thrill em.
Fuck it show me my competition and Im gonna kill em.
Like a murderer.
Then i take the crown like a burglar.
Swear niggas never come around with the circular.
In the field Im the real deal.
You a perjurer.
Sex appeal and some high heels.
I can work with her.
She don't love me.
At least that i know my momma cares.
I love going home.
Cause there ain't no drama there.
And Obama care treats big pharma fair but.
They don't give a shit about me as far as Im aware.
But I ain't fittin to get all into that.
The way Im spitting bars its like I invented rap.
Got the key to the stars underneath my fitted cap.
Once the games ours mother fuckers never get it back.
Don't give props give me payment.
In the presence of a king hit the pavement.
I cool a hot nigga off.
Where the flame went?
Kill a top dog nigga just for entertainment, bow.

Follow the movement.
Talk my shit.
Number one, I don't have to assume it.
