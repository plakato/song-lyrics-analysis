Cast In Steel Lyrics
by A-ha.


Meet me at the turnaround.
Stop your car and look around.
There I will be waiting.
Forget for once how everything.

Fades.
It fades away.

I'll never get over what we said.
It lingers in my head.
I'll always remember what we knew.
One hundred percent to be true.

To be right.
To be real.
Set in stone.
And cast in steel.

We made a pact.
Eye to eye.
Cross your heart.
And hope to die.

Can you see the end of things?
Can you see it happening?
Feel the ashes on the wind.
Don't you hate how everything.

Falls.
Just falls away.

I'll never get over what we said.
It lingers in my head.
I'll always remember what we knew.
One hundred percent to be true.

To be right.
To be real.
Set in stone.
And cast in steel.

We made a pact.
Eye to eye.
Cross your heart.
And hope to die.

It lingers in my head.
I'll always remember what we knew.
One hundred percent to be true.

Set in stone.
And cast in steel.
To be right and.
To be real.
Set in stone.
And cast in steel.
