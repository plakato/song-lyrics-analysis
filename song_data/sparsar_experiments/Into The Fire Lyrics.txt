Into The Fire Lyrics
by Wolf Gang UK.

Into The Fire.

Sit back in the seats if you don't want to go.
Cause the lights are out tonight.
But you will see our style burning in the sky.
As we set the town on fire.

We want to shake up the people.
They've been sleeping for too long.
And the whispers from the spirits.
Of the men who drew that dawn.

Now is our chance.
Now is our chance.
And we can dance into the fire.

There are marks on the street of the way to go.
If you feel they did you wrong.

And so tonight is your chance.
For in the hour you may not live that ling.
We have a message to inspire.
The loneliest of souls.

When the town is on fire.
The world will hear our call.

Now is our chance.
Now is our chance.
And we can dance into the fire.

Now is our chance.
Now is our chance.
And we can dance into the fire.

Now is our chance.
Now is our chance.
And we can dance, and we can dance into the fire.

Now is our chance.
And we can dance into the fire.

Now is our chance.
And we can dance into the fire.
