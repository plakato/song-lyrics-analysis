These Girls Lyrics
by Swazi Jive Entertainment.


You, don't know these girls 
You, don't know these girls 
You, don't know these girls 
You, don't know these girls 
Truth be told. 
You should know, 
They be giving cudi on the low 
Kikwa best. Believe it 
Gave you all the love you needed, 
But, you don't! These 
It comes from these 
Been about these 
Still about these 
 
I fiend about these 
Still scheme about these 
Have wet dreams about these 
But. I can't trust. None of these 
The matter of fact is the love attachment 
My pull out game ain't, the pee on the mattress 
But. I can't have kids right now, because my beats and my rap still need more
practice 
Need more practice. My dog 
Need, less action. My dog, 
Club 8, is the fashion can't fuck with that dog 
I can't fuck with that dog 
I can't take it. No more 
Forget. All these girls, man, 
Let's head for the door. 
 
The reason that I leave them. 
 
I'm trynna put'em for the 
 
I'm, not saying that I hate y'all 
 
I'm, just saying I can't take y'all 
 
I ain't sayin'. We all just came for cool 
I'm, just sayin', I can't depend on you, 
Is it wrong to kinda bend the rules. 
We cut like blades, but never spoon, 
Can we chill for a bit and watch cartoons, 
Looney Tunes and I'm out the door 
I mean I like the show, but we might just over indulge 
Or, not guess we'll, never know. 
I bet, you can't believe it 
No other man's ever done. You like he did 
Now your state of mind's. All heated 
Just trust that you dealing with some genius' 
And. Just for your information. 
We ain't really trynna be hated 
Sometimes. I think I shoulda stayed there 
But. I wouldn't have recorded as if I gave in 
 
Kill you like 
And, I'm very seri- 
5 years later. This will be a funny story, 
You be 
Apologies. I don't even know I follow these 
Guess, I'm looking out for what I seize 
Like, how you fit that 36 ass in 34 jeans, 
Askies, Labantwana, askies 
Everything, you do is just a 100 degrees 
Out here taking selfies like they pay school fees. 
Yes, please 
I wan't! My girl, looking like Nomfundo's Bees, 
And my resolution for 2015 
Is that I'm treating all my women like queens, 
That's right, I'm rolling, deep, 
Cooking dinner 
And right after might do the dishes 
I'll call your bae 
Cut her with you 
Might. Even let you meet my mom and sister 
That's love and sex 
Trust and respect 
And I'll. Stop calling women bitches 
No, wait! I'M tripping 
And the world AK just kidding 
No. No, we see it all the time. 
Women fall in love. Men just fall in line 
Good girls are hard to find 
So. Nobody touching this heart of mine 
Keep, your underscores 
Cause. The bottom line is I'm working like overtime 
Only committed to dropping the hottest lines.
