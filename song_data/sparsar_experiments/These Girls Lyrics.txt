These Girls Lyrics
by Swazi Jive Entertainment.


You don't know these girls.
You don't know these girls.
You don't know these girls.
You don't know these girls.
Truth be told.
You should know.
They be giving cudi on the low.
Kikwa, best believe it.
Gave you all the love you needed.
But, you don't these.
It comes from these.
Been about these.
Still about these.

I fiend about these.
Still scheme about these.
Have wet dreams about these.
But I can't trust none of these.
The matter of fact is, the love attachment.
My pull out game ain't the pee on the mattress.
But I can't have kids right now because my beats and my rap still need more.
practice.
Need more practice my dog.
Need less action my dog.
Club 8 is the fashion can't fuck with that dog.
I can't fuck with that dog.
I can't take it no more.
Forget all these girls man.
Let's head for the door.

The reason that I leave them.

I'm trynna put 'em for the ?

I'm not saying that I hate y'all.

I'm just saying I can't take y'all.

I ain't sayin' we all just came for cool.
I'm just sayin' I can't depend on you.
Is it wrong to kinda bend the rules.
We cut like blades but never spoon.
Can we chill for a bit and watch cartoons.
Looney Tunes and I'm out the door.
I mean I like the show but we might just over indulge.
Or not guess we'll never know.
I bet you can't believe it.
No other man's ever done you like he did.
Now your state of mind's all heated.
Just trust that you dealing with some genius'.
And just for your information.
We ain't really trynna be hated.
Sometimes I think I shoulda stayed there.
But I wouldn't have recorded as if I gave in.

Kill you like ?
And I'm very seri-.
5 years later this will be a funny story.
You be.
Apologies, I don't even know I follow these.
Guess I'm looking out for what I seize.
Like how you fit that 36 ass in 34 jeans.
Askies! Labantwana askies!
Everything you do is just a 100 degrees.
Out here taking selfies like they pay school fees.
Yes please.
I wan't my girl looking like Nomfundo's Bees.
And my resolution for 2015.
Is that I'm treating all my women like queens.
That's right I'm rolling deep.
Cooking dinner.
And right after might do the dishes.
I'll call your bae.
Cut her with you.
Might even let you meet my mom and sister.
That's love and sex.
Trust and respect.
And I'll stop calling women bitches.
No wait I'm tripping.
And the world AK, just kidding.
No no we see it all the time.
Women fall in love, men just fall in line.
Good girls are hard to find.
So nobody touching this heart of mine.
Keep your underscores.
Cause the bottom line is I'm working like overtime.
Only committed to dropping the hottest lines.
For DMTA.
Swazi Jive.
