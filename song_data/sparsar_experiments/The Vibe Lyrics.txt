The Vibe Lyrics
by 3rdiiiUth.


We trying to have a good time.
We set the party off right.

Stand up. Up off your backside.
Then throw your hands high. We 'bout to set it off right.
And if you are objecting.
Then get to stepping. We trying to have a good time.
Listen. I don't be dissing.
So if I'm chilling, please don't be killing me vibe.
Please don't be killing my vibe. We just trying to have a good time.

Lume D's on the mic.
Pass the light, so I can ignite to write.
It's only right, ho.
Hard rhymes like lines of Blow yo, but.
When I blow, no nigga dare step toe to toe.
Trying to catch the beat slipping so I can make my move.
Flow meshes with the melodies to control the groove.
And no, not a single fear while on this road to prove.
That this nigga right here is that dude.
Round for round. Pound for pound, we're the best team doing it.
Ain't dropped an album, but we're who the girls wanna cool it with.
Yea, we're reaching new heights, but we're pulling up the ladder.
To prevent fluke niggas from flocking cause of the latter days.
Microphone blaze, as I spit this hot.
Fire and quench your desire to put you in a mental craze.
Demystifying the ideologies and false prophesies.
Hip Hop just met a Socrates.

Starry night and sunshine.
We double up on Jays. Dynamite. That's a good time.
Looking for trouble? Man yea. We fid it in no time.
Invade by invitation cause it's all on out timelines.
And if it's dope, then 3rdiii's marching in.
Bitches lined up. Siced as fuck cause we walking in.
Midnight Marauding. Bombarding all the pedestrians.
Breaking through these barriers. Niggas thinking we Mexican.
We deep as fuck. It's for a cause, and you can call us a cult.
Them fully packing motherfuckers like they bought us in bulk.
You can't stop us, or knock us down. Bitch it's our now.
Fucking with the Uth. Not entertained by y'all clowns.
Open up your mind. That's your 3rd eye.
Niggas swear I'm deaf. Word of mouth, they heard I.
Spit fires from the heavens that stay fluent in hell.
Cause you know that I'm Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well.
..
Amen.
