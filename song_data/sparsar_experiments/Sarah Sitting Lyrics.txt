Sarah Sitting Lyrics
by Swirlies.

Sarah sitting in her house.

Painting each nail like it's a watercolor.

All day i sit here waiting.

For my fastidious flower.

Look here at her table.

Her life is filled with perfect pictures.

Reds and blues.

In the upstairs room.

But i'm far too shy to try them too.

Tossed and turned all night long.

And in the morning my mind's as good as gone.

She is filling up my head with song.

But she won't tell the words.

So i can't sing along.
