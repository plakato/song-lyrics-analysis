Dead or Alive Lyrics
by Yung Dori.


In my eyes I just see Suicide, i'm blinded by the pesticides.
Embedded high on dreaded Skype.
I'm hitting lines and credit fines.
On Altenen i'm checking lives.
Like dead, dead, dead; it worked this time!
I'm working for the better life you work with me you better try.

Like?
Living in the lime light.
Trying to spend my time right.
Looking for the lime like.

Right!
Right?

Hoping I could die right.
My life up in the sky light.
Just wasted on a dime like.
This life is finite.

That sentimental shit leave my mind in a condecending penalty like we not fine.
I'm a skitzo, running on little magical tricks though, you noticed how I root.
into a tree not vine my nigga.
That ego in you gonna die my nigga.
I spit it on a couple eagles when I'm high my nigga.
I fly my nigga, I'm above the fucking sky my nigga.
So when you yelling for the water that's when I deliver.

When renegade run to get water you work free.
Milk and minute maid to get hard and you thirsty.
Little did you know you got it... tarnished.
You need a little bit of effort in your style when you working.

if you worth it nigga.
Smooth criminal; written up when they lurking with you.
And then they photo shoot that motherfucking birthday giggle and bang.
