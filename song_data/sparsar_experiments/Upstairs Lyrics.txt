Upstairs Lyrics
by Women.

Soon we'll go.
To a place where nobody.
Has been keeping track.
And we'll eat for free.
All while holding hands.

Stripping senses nightly.
Undecided.
All of your blues.
Are just passing through.

Standing there.
While all the men in their hats try to cry.
Sending and puking them down.
Can you want it back.
Would it be alright.

Stripping senses nightly.
Undecided.
All of your blues.
Are just passing through.
