Being Here Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

If you want problems, well I got em.
Everything around me seems to break.
Like a leaky faucet, I just can't stop it.
And I wonder how much more of me you'll take.
And you smile, you smile.
You lift me up like no one else, when it feels I'm a danger to myself.
When I've fallen captive to my fears.
Laying here in your arms of grace, looking in to an angel's face.
You rescue me from the place I disappear.
Just by being here.
When the coldest winds blow.
You shut the windows.
And you leave my demons fighting in the yard.
You rock me easy.
Gather up my pieces.
And you pull me from my fallen house of cards.
And you smile, you smile.
You lift me up like no one else, when it feels I'm a danger to myself.
When I've fallen captive to my fears.
Laying here in your arms of grace, looking in to an angel's face.
You rescue me from the place I disappear.
By being here.
Just by being here.
Well I've stood on the edge of a long way down.
A can't go back, a no way out.
I was on my way to nowhere.
A stranger in my skin, I couldn't find hope.
The places I've been, nothing felt like home.
You found me drifting in the somewhere.
Now you lift me up like no one else, when it feels I'm a danger to myself.
When I've fallen captive to my fears.
Oh, laying here in your arms of grace, looking in to an angel's face.
You rescue me from the place I disappear.
You always rescue me form the place I disappear.
By being here.
Just by being here.
