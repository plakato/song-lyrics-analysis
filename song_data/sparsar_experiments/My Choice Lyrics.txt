My Choice Lyrics
by R.U.I.N..


My classmates like “Finally exams done!”/.
My full plate I wish it was, “I am done!”/.
I wish I could say, “It is finished”/.
Life's a record I'm on every second I don't take minutes/.
K'naan respirator to let it breathe/.
Hate on you few haters pathetic please/.
I got an inferiority complex/.
But I come with superiority to the rest/.
Don't test eat your words son/ there's a sharp tongue /.
Fork in my road/ but I'll take the high road/.
Cause I only have two options/.
I can say what people feel or be so ill it'll make you nauseous/.
True consciousness like Shakur walked the streets/.
Or make you drop to the floor cock the heat/.
The talk could be so lovely dubbly beautiful/.
Or make you prepare for your puppy's funeral/.
Don't push me yo, I'm close to the edge still/.
If I fall, hit ground running like tread mills/.
Leave you dead still/ in your tracks; I know it's either.
‘That's real'/ or “That Man's gotta Chill”/ I could be like.
“I'm ripping/ immigrants/ ligaments/ leaving disfigurements/ clipping Limb.
from limb/ you little kids/ won't figure/ the Original tint/ Of the skin's.
pigment/.
But with that script/ I didn't spit/ shit/ so instead of being The illest.
lyricist MC with two lips/ the Planet's ever seen!/.
Now real talk you'll understand what it means/.
And if I get hate, I'll get a lot more meaner/.
If I don't get props, wait I go rob your theater/.
Like Nas, one mic, but a million pens/.
To spit the truth not these appealing trends/.
Love's victory fire will conquer everything/.
Even the desires to conquer everything/.
God is love, gotta agree Marvin Gaye/.
God is love, gotta be what my heart say/.
In the T-dot but I do it the Brooklyn way/.
Spread love! Spread Love! Hope my music be Cooking change/.
