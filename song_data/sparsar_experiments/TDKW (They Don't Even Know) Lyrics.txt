TDKW (They Don't Even Know) Lyrics
by Vizual.


It's been a while.
I don't see you smile.
Use your words to bring piles.
Look at these files.
Look at those contracts.
Now you're in denial.
Confessed.
But you ain't livin' through the wild.

All I hear.
Rumors and lies.
Guess they didn't like.
The reason why i'm so kind.
I'm a new creation.
Put away those sides.
Got a new mind to keep focus on the price.
Turn up.
Roll up.
Hang over.
Blind.
I don't see life.
I see bondage in disguise.
Don't see self-control.
I see riot in their eyes.
Lives torn apart.
They numb so they won't cry.

They got the message.
Saying I'm not messin'.
Time to open eyes.
Since we blind through oppression.
Push away our dreams.
But Yashua is present.
Society got us on hold while we fear the next step.
We wake up everyday.
Saying what is my purpose.

Don't just second guess it.
Chase the one who made you.
He'll give you direction.
Ones you're plugged in.
You'll get data in your essence.

They don't even know me.
They don't even know me.
They don't even know me.
They they they don't even know me.
They don't even know me.
They they they don't even know me.
They don't even know me.
They they they don't even know me.
