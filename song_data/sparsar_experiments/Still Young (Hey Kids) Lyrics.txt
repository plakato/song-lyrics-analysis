Still Young (Hey Kids) Lyrics
by Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown.

From the school bus to Wall Street, we're all in such a hurry.
Maybe we should slow it on down.
Back to money ain't nothing, good times and running.
That's all we couldn't live without.
Like seeing the sunrise for the first time.
Getting your first kiss, your first fast ride.
Taking the long way home just cause you can.
Baby let's do it all over again.
We're gonna fall just to feel like we're flying every night and day.
We're gonna fight just to get what we got just to give it away.
Oh we're still young.
We're young.
We're still young.
Yeah we're still young.
We're young, we're still young.
Don't you wanna feel that light on your skin.
Don't you wanna live just a little bit.
Don't cha, yeah don't cha, wanna do it all over again.
We're gonna fall just to feel like we're flying every night and day.
We're gonna fight just to get what we got just to give it away.
Oh we're still young.
We're young.
We're still young.
Yeah we're still young.
We're young, we're still young.
