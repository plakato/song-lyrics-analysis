Blackout Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


Yeah, and that's fo' real.
Y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Cause y'all don't know what I did in this game.
In this lifetime of turmoil.
Bein' hard, real hard.
But I'm still here, you feel me ?

3 years old.
In the alley with the Colt.
And my mom's in a trash can.
In southeast tryna get it with some sauce.
From my prego while I was suppose to get laughed at.
I didn't have no birthdays, I didn't have no christmas.
I didn't have no tables with food and shit.
I didn't have the new kicks.
My daddy didn't loan 'em, But.
we don't have the money to do this shit.
I really came from nothin', wasn't suppose to make it.
Wasn't supposed to be up on these stages.
Lookin' at all the pretty faces.
Gettin' sick and logical leavin' in my shit.
And tossin' out the basics.
Wasn't even supposed to be livin'.
Saw your people in a federal prison.
Never stopped me from goin' on missions.
Save my position.
'Till at least I got money all up on people.
Who got up on my business.

Watchin' any Niggas in my mind oughta try.
For the rhyme or when they.
Tryna be friends of me.
I remember when a couple years ago them.
Same motherfuckers we recall was an enemy.
And I'm the one who keep it real.

I remember 7 years up to my pops, to preach with a nigga with south.
Hide me in the trashbag, tossed me up in the closet.
Locked me up in that motherfucker for hours.
My love for the music came as a little snotty nosed kid.
With my whole life ahead of me.
They ain't seein' the best of me at 106 &amp; park.
At the dark with the sharks as my destiny.

From the diamond in the rust.
To a diamond who's shinin'.
Blind and then givin' it up.
Swirlin' and tippin' my cup.
Sippin' they cut.
Right beside motherfuckers.
Who don't be givin' a fuck.
Unless I really wanna blackout.

Sittin' by myself with the pistol in the middle on the devil.
When I put it to my dome.
Nobody can step inside shoes.
Tellin' 'em what I gotta do.
When I think about my crowd.
Doin' different shows.
Different city every night.
They be hidin' when runnin' up in the zone.
Somebody bringin' meetin' different people.
Everyday but they realize that I was all alone.
I just wanna blackout, blackout, blackout.

11 years old:.
-still lookin' bummy.
And dumb with no lunchmoney.
-Started take a knife to school.
Just incase one of these motherfuckers try to take somethin' from me.

Now it's on my lungs.
And my gun's on the front page.
This isn't fun what has begun.
I am so young.
I am the one.
I want to run away.
Chewin' at the world with a pure descent.
And they all wanna hear my shit.
All 'em Niggas that be spittin' wish me dead.
Cause they can hear my spit.
As I chewed on my spearment.
And I'm the one who keep it real.
Lucky if I was even to get a happy meal.
Livin' on crumbs for real.
My mom was ill.
When Motherfuckers was trippin' on unpaid bills.
SHIIT !!!
Here this the life we lead.
The right to breath.
But I was on a mission.
Don't do that stay on the right track.
But it's hard to say that to a who'll never listen.

Sure I was hot but I had no pot to piss in.
Makin' my circle around me so tight.
And if they yell I'd keep 'em off in a distance.
From the L.A. deep from resistance.
Down with the homies.

I'm legally carried.
And that's legally scary.
But until they bury me.
I'mma 'come visious.
