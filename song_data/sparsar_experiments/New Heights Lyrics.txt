New Heights Lyrics
by Tyler Gary.


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, New Heights.

This ones for the niggas that I never gave a fuck about.
I saved up all those fucks so I could plant them on your bitches mouth.
No, it wasn't food when she said she got some in-and-out.
We did a hundred things normal people only dream about.
I been about this life dog.
Why you think she texting me?
I never been a liar.
Unless, she lying right next to me.
And, now you wanna flex me.
Saying she was your destiny.
But, i`m a heartless nigga.
So half your words aren't affecting me.
Did I stutter motherfucker?
I been Robbin Williams.
For all the green like i just seen flubber.
Used to walk, &amp; now I hover.
I'ma master of my craft.
And I never come in last.
Unless we talking about a laugh.
Get more ass then assassins.
Assuming that they are astronauts.
Ask your mom, Ask your pops.
You asinine if you ask a lot.
I been on top, Helipad.
From California got hella swag.
Check the kicks, check the hats.
Been the Greatest check the stats.

Been the greatest  x8.

She tried to steal my dick.
So, I had to sue her.
And she sucked up all my sewage.
It was nothing like a sewer.
I got bigger fish to fry.
My business grouper.
If you truly think your fly.
Then I'm floating where the moons are.
New heights.
Whats it looking like.
Pluto's where I ride my bike.
Yes, its still a planet goddammit.
Understand that I'm blowing up.
Just how I planned it.
Tyler got a mastermind.
And trust me, you ain't running shit.
Tyler got a faster time.
LG, that's my gang.
Lost generation, praise that name.
Me and you.
Ain't the same.
You gotta bigger heart.
I gotta bigger brain.
You lame.
These lyrics to your face.
Critically acclaimed.
Clinically insane.
By jive turkeys.
Who need a little base.
No haste there's a lot.
So I walk to the bank.
And I do what I want.
Give a fuck what ya thank.

Shit, is classy as fuck.
New Heights.
