50's My Favourite Lyrics
by 50 Cent.


I took a sip of the potion.
Little SK, a little Goose, now I'm loose.

Quest for the cheddar I bought shiny Beretta.
I'm firing squad hard, you niggas should know better.
Than to bump with Ferrari, district calamari.
I kill like rebels in Warri, I'm sorry.
I ball like I think I'm the Prince of Abu Dhabi.
Black gold gush out the ground.
Gun powder fly out the pound.
I turn a clown smile upside down.
That's 3 time zones in my watch face.
Still hard to tell time with diamonds all over my watch face.
Twinkle like I'm outta space, I'm the big dipper.
You a little dipper, pipe down little nigga.
Nice wheels, but don't talk money, that's what I'm about.
I could fit your house inside my house.
And your neighbours and ya yard, oh my God.
This shit ain't about shit so I ain't gon' go hard.
Now kick push, kick push, get the fuck outta here, kick push.

You're now being hypnotised, close your eyes.
And say 50′s my favourite, 50, 50's my favourite.
I'm not the the one to play with, I mean what I say, bitch.
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite.
Still on that gutter shit, forever on that gutter shit.
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite.
I know you love that shit, real niggas be loving this.
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite.

Oh shit, now a nigga floating.
That Luger German, thats Kush burning.
I'm Einstein on the grind, my wheels turning.
I'm out in Cali.
Not in Hollywood, Silicon valley.
I'm bout to get rich, I mean real rich.
I'm talking Facebook and Spotify type shit.
I'm not a programmer, I use ghetto grammar.
Slang, pussy, I'm strong as David Banner.
The Hulk, my money come in bulk.
And if this shit go bad I go back to the dope.
Now pay attention to the murder I wrote.
This my light shit, my heavy shit on the album.
Lets get right, bitch.
