Better Days Lyrics
by Twitchy.


Better days than these boring summer rays, 
Layin' down cheifin' eatin couple stack of lays 
Rather be alone. I got the price thay, it pays, aye, 
X2, 
, 
They, say better days come 
Well. If thats true, then I might as run 
Cause im having no fun 
In. This summer, heated sun, 
My, best friends, gone 
And. My hearts just tellin me the whole worlds, wrong 
Crushed into pieces and its staying there for long 
So. I might as well just bottle up sing about in a song 
Time for to me to relax 
Smell of regret and some shitty ass axe, 
Couldn't care. How I look, but how I sound on a track. 
These motherfuckers say im from a city of a rack, 
Thats funny 
Right now getting bitched at by a hunny 
Really fucking hungry need some food in my tummy 
Really stressed out, could use puff of that sticky, 
Need alot 
But writing down lyrics is really all. I really got 
Til I'mma topic like hot 
One life to live, never blow that one shot 
And. If I do 
Then, I fucked up big and I say that true 
Right now im mellow with a lil, hence of blue 
Got, no swag swag swag on you 
Chillin by the bed in my dark ass room 
Waiting for the day that my career does bloom, 
No Stess, just happiness is what they assume 
But my minds in danger and my hearts in doom 
Baby I chill 
Try to live to life seem like no one else is real 
Just speaking. What is ill? 
I promise you this. I won't quit. Reamain still 
Uh
