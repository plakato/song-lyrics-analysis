If It's Good Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.

Ha, what...

Just because I got the loving, on the first night.
Man I know your girls, gon say it ain't right.
Why  should , we play games.
When we both know, we was feeling the same.
Baby if it's good, if it's good, if it's good.
If it's good, if it's good, if it's good.
Baby if it's good, if it's good, if it's good.
If it's good, if it's good, if it's good.

Dirty $.
Look mama, what's all this here bout it.
You offended by the words, that are coming out my mouth.
I bet you why you going through it, dried worrying what your friends say.
Knowing, you wanna shake that tail feather this way.
Baby, I can see that you're grown.
Let a playa take you home, and leave that child's play alone.
Let's get live in the zone, just you and me.
When the G-G hit the spot, he make it hard to pee.
On the pot without a doubt, we shocking and rocking.
Ain't no lip-locking, just headboard knocking.
And it ain't no stopping, if you working with the good.
I'm a fool with this wood, down to put that on the hood.
It's understood, those haters posing as your friends.
Poking they noses in, where they don't belong again.
Let me under your skin, I'll put that spice in your life.
But you can't be scared, to break bread on the first night.

D-Reck.
I'ma straight up catch you, with jabs and uppercuts.
Spit something fly, walk by and pass you up.
This a finesse game, a chemistry thang.
That make you wan' undress, before you even know my name.
So peep a bad actor, never attack her.
On sight, I'ma mack her I'm a dime piece factor.
And she know, she ain't no hoe.
But I'ma do my thing fast, never slow cause I'm a pro.
Forever mashing on the gas, never letting them on me pass.
Never questioning her class, it was passion when we smashed.
It was so so wet, it slicky-slicky tash.
It was gushy-gushy mushy-mushy, I jumped in splash.
Got me so so sprung, pierced navel pierced tongue.
Don't know where she from, but I know she got it done.
Like em juicy like a plum, never do em on the run.
Hide-and-stickies always fun, but I'll be back if you're the one.

D-Gotti.
Baby put it in they face, tell em you don't give a damn.
Girl Gotti had you smoking dro, from Afghanistan.
Sabs played again, make a dime understand.
Flicks on the whip, T.V.'s think I'm playing.
Honey wasn't tripping though, man arrested yo.
It's a show, dress cleavage and breasts yo.
Young Gotto dealing with a model, answering my do'.
Friday night feeling good, met baby up at Cabo's.
Say she stays on grind though, and girl me on purple stuff.
Saw me valet Dub quads, on that Tonka truck.
Smelling like a hunk of skunk, eyes blood shot red.
And they dealing one twelve, chopping game with something red.
And uh shots of Quevo, throwing pesos.
Got a lil' tipsy baby, got you looking like J.Lo.
Say no mo', done that did that.
I'll be back honey, I enjoyed that kit-cat.

A3.
Damn baby how can you find the key, to end of your world.
I'm subject to make your brain twirl, hit it till you hurl.
With your girls, acting like the satin secrets don't drop.
Walking round like you sealed, with a master padlock.
But it's cool, cause I ain't the one the boys try to get her a pen.
But I knew I had you open, once you seen them 20's spin.
To the room ooh wee, what you doing to 3.
Got a nigga feeling like, he fin to skid and see.
Oh, I kinda like the way you work that thang.
But I ain't even, fin to play no games.
On the real, I can't even front you got skills.
But if you can't flip the scrill', watch me burn these wheels.
On the other hand if you can, I might include you in my plans.
Cause I need somebody to knock the dust, off the Lex Land.
So if you feel like this, where you wanna be.
Then you won't have a problem, proving it to me.

I ain't going nowhere baby.
You got a nigga locked down, like you giving the third degree.
For real, holla at your boy.
Baby if it's good, I ain't going nowhere.
Baby if it's good, I ain't going nowhere.
