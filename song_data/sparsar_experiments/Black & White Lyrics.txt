Black & White Lyrics
by Ty Infinite.


Black and white, black and white.
Everything is so fucking black and white.
Yak I might, you say there's shades of gray but you faggots gag alike.
Ty Infinite will attack the mic.
Bite a little bit on the rag I might.
As I inject this adrenaline.
Menacing on these motherfucking plastics in my sight.
I'm fired up like that piff.
I'm wired up like rags is to blow up, explode on my last tick.
And I'm snapping backs like elastic.
Let any motherfucker have it, my havoc.
Get whacked bitch then after they six feet.
I dip quick, I'm past it.
Now hold up, hold up, light it.
Corolla, high end roller.
I am going overflowing.
Waterfall motion, unbottle all emotion.
On these punks and fuckers below me.
Hating always playing phony.
Cloning each other, homo-boning.
So if you think you know me, fuck off.
Rip you apart like tender meat I'm rendering in this oven.
I'm severing your limbs, who's Lector mixed with Dexter? Me.
See masters of deception deceiving receptionees.
See masses of reflections receiving directioning.
While the rest of us, the small of us.
But the best of us gonna call your bluffs.
Fall your luck cause your time is up.
When a Gizmo ducks and a Ty erupts.
It's so black and white, black and white.
This all is so damn black and white.
And simple minded lames is complicated with rhymes.
I spat em nice in this spit bucket I filled in time.
When I said, Fuck it, I'ma kill every line!
Fuck it 'till the day that I die!
This game replaced any space in my mind that was empty.
And then you get me with a tech, heat, it's my pen, see?
Want to bet me? You'll need a Penske for the debt b.
I am deadly, this no testing so don't test me.
Biologist dissecting any optimist.
Directing they views on the best things.
Fuck you! I'm projecting, now silence.
The blackness in conflict with the whiteness.
I promise to ripen the Black &amp; White bitch!
