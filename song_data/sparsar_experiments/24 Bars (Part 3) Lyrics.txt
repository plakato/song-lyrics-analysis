24 Bars Part 3 nigga.
Gang!

I'm so high off this thoink.

I switch my flow up every track bitch I'm real hot.
I'm known to gangbang and let steels pop.
And bitch I'm still in the cut with the fucking mop.
I'm sippin act, plus all my niggas strapped.
We can get into that.
No chitter chat.
My nigga Dutchie clap.
No, this is not a rap.

We on that, these niggas know that.
Aye where yo ho at?
This 4 fat, this chamber blow back, it push yo fro back.
Now hold that.
My homie took yo strap come get yo pole back.
Fuck this rap shit, I'll still slide with them poles jack.
Shootouts back and forth we can go tit for tat.
You niggas petty shooting 2's and playing Pitty Pat.

I don't fuck around bitch it's shots fired.
You a fucking snitch nigga where's the wire?
Rotating hoes like some fucking tires.
All my niggas with me they be bucking irons.
What's a pelican cause I'm fucking flying.
