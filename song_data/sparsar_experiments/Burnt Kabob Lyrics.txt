Burnt Kabob Lyrics
by Rumi.

Last year, I admired wines. This.
I'm wandering inside the red world.

Last year, I gazed at the fire.
This year I'm burnt kabob.

Thirst drove me down to the water.
Where I drunk the moon's reflection.

Now I'm a lion staring up totally.
Lost in love with the thing itself.

Don't ask question about longing.
Look in my face.

Soul drunk, body ruined, these two.
Sit helpless in a wrecked wagon.
Neither knows how to fix it.

And my heart, I'd say it was more.
Like a donkey sunk in the mudhole.
Struggling and miring deeper.

But listen to me: for one moment.
Quit being sad. Hear blessings.
Dropping their blossoms.
Around you. God.
