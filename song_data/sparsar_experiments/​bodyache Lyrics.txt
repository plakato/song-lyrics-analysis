â€‹bodyache Lyrics
by Purity Ring.


You said you said
Turn the lights down, I wan na be alone
I. Read your head. Away
I couldn't stand how it pleaded
I needed to take

Take a break. Take me down. Take me down there
I wan na stare at the tears how they watered your years
Take. A break. Take me down. Take me down there
I wan na stare at your tears how they

I I I lied. Now I'm lying awake
I. I I cried'til my body ache
I. I I lied now, I'm lying awake
I, I I cried'til my body, ache

You, sweat and you bled
I couldn't look cause your body. Your body. Would shake
And you feared a lonely death
Like a lake leaves you alone in her depths

I wan na know. What'S your
I wan na know, what's your quietest, feeling
I saw you break out. I saw you break out
Saw. You unreeling
I lied. Now, I'm lying awake
I cried until my body. Ache
I lie. Now I'm lying awake
Now, I'm lying awake! Now, I'm lying awake

Now, I'm lying awake! Now, I'm lying awake
Until, my body ache. Until my body ache
I, I I cried'til my body, ...
