Can't Hide Lyrics
by Unity Klan.


You can run but you can't hide.
Better get your life right.
4x.

Jaz.
When I take out my Bible and I wave it all around.
Bindin demons and the devils up and down the town.
On the grave sites of my friend that died a time ago.
Now you know, we got the flow and the mad laugh.
We be burnin up the tempature.
Now Im sure we sendin chills up your spine.
Of a different kind, are you blind.
Or the colors of your eyes, dont be scared of what ya see.
And we be creepin up on the back of you, can you smell the fuems.
Of the chemicals known of Babylon of His lap.
Ain't you glad you got God on your side.
Now you can't run, but you surely can't hide G.
You better watch out, cause I see you, can you see me.
If you dont, then you better start to prayin, no delayin.
Cause Im tellin you, the demons I be slayin.
You better watch out, you better watch your back.
Cause when it comes to Unity, we're cuttin us no slack.

DG.
Breakin spells, cages in your minds.
Its my God that make the blind see, and the lame talk.
Cripple walk, as we creepin, stalk, demons drop.
So I gotta bring it to ya raw somethin you never saw.
Or seen, but you comin like a fiend.
But stop here a scene, we you get dropped 6 feet deep.
And when your evil becomes your reality.
Stuck in the pit of hell, for eternity.
Cryin, everyday diein, pain multiplyin.
Tryin to escape, but your soul is like a tape.
Always playin, hurtin burnin twist and turnin.
To the point of no return and now you burn.
Burn in the fire up in stone.
Cause stone is the way of the walk.
You were thinkin while your were sippin.
And tweakin, trippin then you got to slippin.
Cause there's nobody flawless.

Big J.
I got them complex, perplexed skills.
That be reflectin outreach technique.
As I speak, is what I sow, is what I reap.
Demons creep, tryin to make you holla, hide your pride.
Gotcha locked up in them chains, so you can't recognize.
Eyes, on every sin and move you make.
Cause you dont wanna be ready to fool that man.
But God will know that you will faint take.
Correction, be ready for that last day inspection.
Leathal injection, heavenly incision whats your direction.
Yeah, Im not the one to play church on Sunnday.
Then Monday play them games, like I dont know Jesus' name.
Its a shame, to see my brothers play roles.
Tryin to entertain for fame, instead of reachin lost souls.
Now, take off that christain makes, lets hide no sin.
But still you try to hide that conviction wit in.
Why, dont you die to your flesh.
So you can live for the Best, cut the stress.
And let your soul be at rest, yes.
