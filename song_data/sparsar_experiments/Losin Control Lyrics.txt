Losin Control Lyrics

Produced by Russ.

She's fallin' in love now.
Losin' control now.
Fightin' the truth.
Tryin' to hide.
But I think it's alright girl.
Yeah, I think it's alright girl.

She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her.
Cause her last relationship was a disaster.
Accusations everyday she didn't know why.
All her calls would be ignored he's on his own time.
Shoulda' ended it before it started.
All she ever got was broken hearted.
He was cheating on her tryna' flip it.
Back on her like a victim.
Now she's all alone and starting over.
Now she's got baggage on her shoulder.
But the new guy really loves her.
She loves him but she doesn't trust herself anymore.

She's fallin' in love now.
Losin' control now.
Fightin' the truth.
Tryin' to hide.
But I think it's alright girl.
Yeah, I think it's alright girl.

Despite her past she can't help the attraction.
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one.
He redefines in every way what love is.
She fell for him and hasn't gotten' up since.
Every now and then she goes off though.
Beating on his chest like a bongo.
He understands she's coming from a hurt place.
Answers all the questions on her survey.
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust.
Doesn't call a hoe after hang ups.
Gives her everything she ever wanted.
And even though she still feels haunted.

She's fallin' in love now.
Losin' control now.
Fightin' the truth.
Tryin' to hide.
But I think it's alright girl.
Yeah, I think it's alright girl.
