Such A Joke Lyrics
by Vivian Girls.

Oh, what an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine.
The note he wrote was such a joke, your friends all laugh until they choke.
Oh, what an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine.
The note he wrote was such a joke, your friends all laugh until they choke.

Oh, what an awful looking time to meet a nice new valentine.
The note he wrote was such a joke, your friends all laugh until they choke.
