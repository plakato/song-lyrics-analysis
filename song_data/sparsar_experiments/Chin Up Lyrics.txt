Chin Up Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.

Bitch come here.
What the fuck's that what you sayin?
I'm finna show 'em I ain't playing.
Let me show 'em I ain't playing.

Boy look here!
I'm smoking all my own zips.
I don't let no one creep in here.
You come in here, you disappear.

I tell that bitch do not come over here!
I got a sign that says beware.
I could attack you from my chair.
And Xavier from X-Men don't compare.

I'm the only damn captain up in here!

If he don't listen I'mma end shit.
Let me finish killing that boy before his sentencing.
I'm sentencing these niggas to their punishment.
Who is next? We end that boy career.
If he ain't legit, extra quick.
Bitch I've been a boss since before I was on that Ethel shit.
Now I got my own squad swinging on whoever, bitch.
Tundra boy season on the way, I.
won't take nuthin' less.
Ion give no fuck about how you feel, I regret nothing man.

Bitch come here!
What the fuck's that what you said?
I'm finna show 'em I ain't playing.
Let me show 'em I ain't playing.

Bitch come here!
What the fuck's that what you said?
I'm finna show 'em I ain't playing.

Let me show 'em I ain't finna fucking play with you niggas, boy.
What the fuck!
