Chin Up Lyrics
by Xavier Wulf.

Bitch, come here 
What the fuck's that what you sayin 
I'm finna show'em, I ain't playing 
Let me show'em. I ain't playing 
 
Boy! Look here: 
I'm smoking, all my own zips 
I! Don'T let no one creep in here! 
You come in here! You disappear! 
 
I! Tell that bitch do not come over here. 
I got a sign that says: beware: 
I could attack you from my chair, 
And, Xavier from X-Men. Don'T compare 
 
I'm the only damn captain up in here, 
 
If, he don't listen! I'Mma end shit! 
Let me finish: killing that boy before his sentencing 
I'm sentencing these niggas to their punishment. 
Who is next. We end that boy career 
If. He ain't, legit, extra, quick, 
Bitch. I'Ve been a boss since before I was on that Ethel shit 
Now, I got my own squad swinging on whoever bitch 
Tundra boy season on the way I
won't take nuthin' less 
Ion, give no fuck about how you feel. I regret nothing. Man 
 
Bitch, come here, 
What the fuck's that what you said, 
I'm finna show'em, I ain't playing 
Let me show'em. I ain't playing 
 
Bitch come here, 
What the fuck's that what you said, 
I'm finna show'em, I ain't playing 
 
Let me show'em. I ain't finna fucking play with you: niggas boy 
What, the fuck
