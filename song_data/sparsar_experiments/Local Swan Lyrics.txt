Local Swan Lyrics
by The Zolas.

In Montreal's tiny pond.
She and I we smoulder.
The local swan, my amazon.
With coathanger shoulders.

My god, it's a mirage; she's booking to go.
I'll swim the St. Laurent cause I lost her and I succumb.

When all your nights are starry blurs.
Will you remember me?
When all your friends are photographers.
Will you remember me?

I refuse.
To reminisce.
Needle cracks and tape hiss.
Blue tattoos of the things I miss.
Are they bruise or cicatrice?
Oh no, fear the plateau.
There's no up or down.
Costars and Hollywood tsars they flood my mind and I drown.

Walking by your window, I called you for the first time.
“yeah, the one who spilled my drink on you last night.”.
And in my underlit apartment, you let me paint you by the flame.
I've painted you a hundred times and still can't sign my name.

When all your nights are starry blurs.
Will you remember me?
When all your friends are photographers.
Will you remember me?
The scene is set to see your face.
On every silver screen.
When all you need is a hiding place.
Will you remember me?
