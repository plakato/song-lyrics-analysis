Sleep Alone Lyrics
by Two Door Cinema Club.

Know my only goal is to see.
When I'm only fast asleep.
It takes more than strength to find.
This piece of mind.

So I'll hold, hold, hold.
Hold it close to my heart beating.
With every step.
Hold, hold, hold it close.

He sleeps alone.
He needs no army where he's headed cause he knows.
That they're just ghosts.
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, ohh.
And I may go.
To places I have never been to just to find.
The deepest desires in my mind.

We, we only know what we see.
Cause we're always fast asleep.
Is it so hard not to believe?
That we'll never know.

Oh, hold hold hold.
Hold me close.
I've never been this far from home.
Hold hold hold me close.

It's in my head and I have said.
That I must be like him now.
He sleeps alone, he sleeps alone.
And one last chance to make sense.
Of what is long escaped ours.
He sleeps alone, I sleep alone.

He sleeps alone.
He needs no army where he's headed cause he knows.
That they're just ghosts.
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, ohh.

And I don't know.
If in the morning I will be here and it's old.
But if he'd known.
That I was worthy, I was worthy.
I was worthy, I was.

Ohh ohh ohh.
Ohh ohh ohh.
