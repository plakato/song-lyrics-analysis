Da Darkside Lyrics
by Yung Ro.


Try to help em understand, Pain the underground.
What happens yeah, street shit nigga.
Where my street niggas at, you wondering why wait up.

Ain't no sunshine, when she's gone.
It's not warm, when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine, when she's gone.
And she's always, gone too long.
Anytime, she goes away.

Yung Ro.
And I've been searching, for your love.
In desperate need of your warmth, say heaven I need a hug.
Cause on the darkside, it's cold we sinning.
So cold it's a damn shame, I think it froze my feelings.
Now I'm a numb nigga, started off as mama's boy.
The baby boy but the game shady boy, I hate it boy.
Ain't seen love, since mama rocked me to sleep.
Standing on the block and the streets, with killers cocking they heat.
Yeah, and they plotting to creep.
Watching your feet, move wrong and they'll rock you to sleep.
But ain't no lulibys, when the pistol sing to ya.
Nothing but drama and plex, what these vilians bring to ya.
Can't say I'm innocent, and all this bullshit.
Cause since mama left me, I been riding with a full clip.
It's kill or be killed, get real or get drilled.
Or stay the fuck out of the streets, play your part and sit still nigga.

Yung Ro.

Cause way before the limelight, I been doing crimes right.
Just some background info, for those who curious.
Rose a period, nothing after me and I'm serious.
So don't make me, make you one of my victims.
Cause you can't find that motherfucker, if I say I'm gon get him.
Cause I'm gon get him and they gon get him, and put him on a stretcher.
Yes sir you can bet ya, dollar I'll catch ya.
And you won't see it coming, cause I'm a pro.
Times hard, and for the right price you gotta go so.
Be careful, when you strolling on my darkside.
Cause when you battling a best, you gotta have your heart right.
And it's the same for me, but peep what I keep baby.
My 3-80, shit the streets made me.
So you can judge a nigga, but you can't budge a nigga.
And it's nobody nigga, cause nobody love a nigga like that.
