The Chop Shop Lyrics
by Twisted Insane.


Hey, what's up man?
You wanna race?
Yeah just a friendly race.
Lets say from here to the end of the beat.
On your marks, get set, go.

Finna beat the instrumental like it was a denim.
I'll be in your mental, fill 'em on the middle.
Every time I sit and think about the Voodoo.
They be happy and I'm on 'em, wake up and.
I knew the mommy was a goner.
Papa never run away, now put the gun away.
Before a bullet's put up in your fruit loop.
With a deuce deuce I'mma put a bullet hole up.
In your brain the size of Bruce Bruce.
I'ma dominate it with abomination.
What you think it really doesn't matter?
Put a body part up on a platter.
Someone better listen, 'fore you come up missing.
Put 'em in a kitchen bitchin' never get you nothing.
But a kitchen knife up in your bladder.
When I run up on 'em, put the gun up on 'em.
Nigga, feel the pressure when I meet him.
Beastin' with a demon knockin' at my do'.
Is anybody home, I'm outta my mind, I'm psycho.
Makin' it? wicked and sick, I might go and I.
Finish ya, throwin' your head in a pit.
A murderer servin' up, put 'em in oven, I'm.
Loving to eat a bitch spine tonight.
I'm choppin' 'em up, are they ready for Jason and.
Freddy and turning your brain to spaghetti-.
Confetti to celebrate,.
nobody up on the level.
Not even the devil nigga.
Funny as I make a wish,.
you make a diss and.
See if anybody listen to you when I'm pissin.
On you and your face, put.
you in a grave.
Better get a shovel nigga.
Ain't no competition I don't really care.
Who it is, what his name is, how famous.
His anus is, I am just better!
They don't want it with the dangerous.
Uncaged and untamed individual.
In your brain and put two through your sweater.
I be on a different level.
They don't wanna meddle with me in the ghetto.
Foot up on the pedal if you wanna settle.
With me, I will pull up on you in the drop top.
Blastin' 'em in that ass, put 'em in a bag.
Drug 'em though the grass, matter fact.
When I leave a motherfucker leakin'.
I'ma bring him up in the Chop Shop, yeah!

Choppin' everybody, ain't no competition.

Welcome to the Chop Shop.
Nobody on it whenever they want it.
I hit 'em with double up.
triple quadruple.
And nigga nobody can fuck with me.

I keep on bussin', I hit you with choppas.
And chop you to bits.
Bust with the blammer,.
hit you with the rammer.
My hammer will spit.
Try we will light him up, somebody tie him up.
Fry him to grits.
Come if they want to, them run up on me, they will.
Die with this shit.

Everybody wanna be a chopper, nigga, pop off.
I be animated, but I really wanna run and.
Spit the venom in they.
face.
I will barbecue a nigga, fuck around and try'na.
Step up to the plate.
Hope you got your runnin' shoe.
When I be gunnin', fool, won't be no close race.
I burn rubber, ain't no other mothafuckin' Sickopatomous.
Simple and plain, I'm really-really bad and can't nobody stand me.
Fuck around and get your noodle in a bowl!
I challenge anybody, bring it to me if you want that shit.
I bring it to you in a minute and I will not finish.
Until I rip through your skull!
It's obvious I make you nervous every time I come around you.
Ain't it funny because I been patient,.
Ain't no better ?sensation?, nigga.
Won't you take a lesson from the monster!
Puttin' everybody and they mama to the Matrix.
Don't say shit, just turn around and run the.
Fuck away before I hunt ya!
I be on a different level.
They don't wanna meddle with me in the ghetto.
Foot up on the pedal if you wanna settle.
With me, I will pull up on you in the drop top.
Blastin' 'em in that ass, put 'em in a bag.
Drug 'em though the grass, matter fact.
When I leave a motherfucker leakin'.
I'ma bring him up in the Chop Shop, yeah!

Choppin' everybody, ain't no competition.

Welcome to the Chop Shop.
Nobody on it whenever they want it.
I hit 'em with double up,.
triple, quadruple.
And nigga nobody can fuck with me.

Somebody wake me up outta my sleep.
Tell me I'm dreamin' they see me, they want me to be taken off of my feet.

They crazy, you peepin' so much I be wonderin' how in the fuck I'mma gonna be.
up in the club with the heat try'na catch a nigga that wanna leap.
Put 'em all up in that Chop Shop.
Get cropped off in a drop top.
Nigga, this Insane runnin' 'fore they.
Comin' at you with the knock off.
-Knock-knock!
-Who is it?
-Orange!
-Orange who?
-Orange you glad a mothafucka like me's not.
Runnin' down your block with the pop-pop?
They be lookin' at me like a mothafucka.
Second rate and I don't need you niggas.
All up on me and all by my lonely.
You was only homies when I feed you niggas.
Choppin' people since, you know.
The fuckers was in middle school.
I be in it, front of class, I be on that ass.
Don't nobody laugh when I teach you niggas.
Blood stains on the floor board with a gore whore.
Kill a bitch up in the kitchen, nigga, quit your bitchin'.
Drag you to the four-door.
Poor whore, I hammer the pussy.
I bet you was feelin like Thor tore.
Gimme more-more of the horrorcore.
Nigga lookin' like he's straight from Mordor.
Drag a nigga through the shadows.
I'mma really take you.
Man off, even Gandalf can't save you.
Little bit of brain might tame but won't save you.
Get my nigga Lynch to come up in this.
Mothafucka right now and bake you.
Take you into a different level, nigga, where the devil lurkin'.
Which bitch I wanna fuck, man, I don't know for certain.
Depends on which one of them got the best ass for twerkin'.
And I come back to the room, let me hit the womb through beef curtains.
!
The Chop Shop!
