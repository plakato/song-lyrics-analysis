Spotlightz Lyrics
by XO-IQ.


Waited some time for the hand of fate.
Dreamin'a dream I can hardly wait.
We are gonna be a part of it.
No stopping us now the fire is lit.

Blast off now hear the sonic boom.
Everybody's gotta get down in the room.
Shoot for the stars we'll wave to the moon.
When the Lightning strike go zoom zoom zoom.
We're taking over better step aside.
We'll hit the road but we'll still need a ride.
We're gonna get some work on a grand design.
Tag you on a post when we get online.
If we have the time.

Turn up the Spotlights.
We're on our way.
Turn up the Spotlights.
We wanna play.
We'll get it.
I bet it.
We're gonna be stars one day.

All we gotta do is right a song.
Then we'll got our own emoticon.
Everywhere we go they scream our name.
I guess that comes with the price of fame.

Blast off now hear the sonic boom.
Everybody's gotta get down in the room.
Shoot for the stars we'll wave to the moon.
When the Lightning strike go zoom zoom zoom.
We're taking over better step aside.
We'll hit the road but we'll still need a ride.
We're gonna get some work on a grand design.
Tag you on a post when we get online.
If we have the time.

Turn up the Spotlights.
We're on our way.
Turn up the Spotlights.
We wanna play.
We'll get it.
Ibet it.
We're gonna be stars one day.

We'll be in the sky they'll see us glow.
Over the air waves on the radio.
Just give us the lights we'll steal the show.
Throw your hands up then lose control.
Work everyday and all through the night.
Only get one shot better do it right.
Won't stop 'till everybody knows the name.
They better be ready cause we'll bring the fame.

Turn up the Spotlights.
We're on our way.
Turn up the Spotlights.
We wanna play.
We'll get it.
I bet it.
We're gonna be stars one day.
