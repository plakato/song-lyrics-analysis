Come Lyrics
by Zodiac.

So why don't you ever come to my house.
So why don't you come over.
Get high, we can get high you know.
Or something like that.
Maybe not.

I dream the states of my paddle.
Her taste is on my tongue.
Always had a loss for words.
Wanting you to come.
You were right here in front of me.
Third dimension's where we often greet.

Goose bumbs set my fingertips.
Elevation in your eye.
Floating was so effortless.
There's feelings no goodbyes.
Here right here, we setting sail.
Holding on to a siren steer.
She's diving down to where my serpent dwell.

My dream queen, how could you run of me.
My dream queen, how could you run of me.
How could you run of me.
My dream queen, how could you run of me.
My dream queen, how could you run of me.
Feeling's slowly in the deep sea.

Our heart beats are autenthic.
Scaling all my will.
The power of attraction lifts to never feel.
The balance by the extra.
The need not,the want.
Won't let me go.
You catch by own it's whispers.
Same place you unfold.
I'm telling you we rain away.
It's natural to be best friends, misbehave.
So dream.

My dream queen, how could you run of me.
My dream queen, how could you run of me.
How could you run of me.
My dream queen, how could you run of me.
My dream queen, how could you run of me.
Feeling's slowly in the deep sea.
