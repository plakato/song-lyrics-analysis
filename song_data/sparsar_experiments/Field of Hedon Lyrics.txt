Field of Hedon Lyrics
by Wovenhand.

Master say on.
Good teacher, yes.
We have heard it said.
A certain man, a certain ruler.
If there is no law there is no threat.
New gods we have chosen.
War is so the gate.
In it's turning it â€¦tremble.
Woe to Earth.
Heaven has dropped its gates.
Who is this who comes from yon.
Dressed in this red robe?
In my stepping out.
Out the field of Hedon.
My beloved is clear and crimson.
He wears the eagle feather.
Chief among ten thousand.
The angel of the Lord stood by.
Master say on.
Master say on.
Master say on.
Master say on.
Who is this who comes from yon.
Dressed in this red robe?
In my stepping out.
Out the field of Hedon.
In splendor.
Master say on.
Master say on.
Master say on.
Master say on.
