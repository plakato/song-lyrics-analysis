Watercolors Lyrics
by Swimming With Dolphins.

Praying that the pain stops.
Counting all the tear drops falling on your pillow.
Guess he hit a weak spot.
Heard it was a cheap shot, hate to say, I told you so.
Yeah, it's a joke.
How many hits till your sweet bones finally break?
And how many nights all alone is it going to take?
He's got a hold of your heart now, baby.
And you don't even know.
He's got a hold of your heart now, baby.
That's why I have to let you go.
That's why I have to let you go, oh.
Told me that you're alright.
I can see you're not quite the girl you were before.
Will it take a landslide.
To help you decide there's nothing left anymore?
Yeah, it's a joke.
How many hits till your sweet bones finally break?
And how many nights all alone is it going to take?
Well, I guess I oughta back down.
I thought you would come around.
Guess I oughta back down.
Cause you are nowhere to be found.
This is what you wanted now.
So is this how you pictured it?
And this is what you wanted now.
The two can be so different.
He's got a hold of your heart now, baby.
And you don't even know.
He's got a hold of your heart now, baby.
And you don't even know.
He's got a hold of your heart now, baby.
That's why I have to let you go.
That's why I have to let you go, oh, oh.
He's got a hold of your heart now, baby.
And you don't even know.
He's got a hold of your heart now, baby.
That's why I have to let you go.
That's why I have to let you go, oh.
Gotta let you go, I gotta let you go.
