Falling Slowly Lyrics
by The Swell Season.


I don't know you.
But I want you.
All the more for that.
Words fall through me.
And always fool me.
And I can't react.

And games that never amount.
To more than they're meant.
Will play themselves out.

Take this sinking boat and point it home.
We've still got time.
Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice.
You'll make it now.

Falling slowly, eyes that know me.
And I can't go back.
Moods that take me and erase me.
And I'm painted black.

You have suffered enough.
And warred with yourself.
It's time that you won.

Take this sinking boat and point it home.
We've still got time.
Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice.
You'll make it now.

Falling slowly sing your melody.
I'll sing along.
