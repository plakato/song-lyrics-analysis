Better Than I Lyrics
by SWV.

She got my eyes, she got my hair.
Go on and stare, complexion to sing.
It wouldn't be the same if you knew she didn't care.
About you the way that I do now.
So don't go thinkin' that she's better than I.

I'ma keep it one hundred.
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why.
She ain't got nothin' on my, uh-ah.
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I.

I'm gon' shoot you.
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why.
Well, I'm gonna shoot you while I'm fin up.
Fin up, fin up, fin up, fin up to now.

She doesn't cook, she doesn't clean.
Steam you jeans, she doesn't rush.
Doesn't take much to do to win your love.
You're something in common we share.
But don't go thinkin' that she's better than I.

Boy, you got plenty to choose.
Boy, don't forget 80-20 rules.
So why she dance? It don't even matter.

Cause I do my things better.

I'ma keep it one hundred.
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why.
She ain't got nothin' on my, uh-ah.
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I.

I'm gon' shoot you.
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why.
Well, I'm gonna shoot you while I'm fin up.
Fin up, fin up, fin up, fin up to now.

Way before you saw me walkin' down the aisle you told me.
I'm the type of girl to stand out in a crowd.
You said you liked my smile way before we said our vows.
I was your Tenderoni and you was my Bobby Brown.

Ba-ba-baby, take a ride, you've been playin' me a while.
Came in her too, got us both like wow.
But I'm fin to hit the dial if you're still out on the prowl.
And you can't commit to vows cause you keep committin' violence.

Boy, you got plenty to choose.
Boy, don't forget 80-20 rules.
So why she dance? It don't even matter.

Cause I do my things better.

I'ma keep it one hundred.
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why.
She ain't got nothin' on my, uh-ah.
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I.

I'm gon' shoot you.
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why.
Well, I'm gonna shoot you while I'm fin up.
Fin up, fin up, fin up, fin up to now.

I'ma keep it one hundred.
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why.

She ain't got nothin' on my, uh-ah.
Don't go thinkin' that she's better than I.

I'm gon' shoot you.
She ain't got nothin' that can prove why.
Well, I'm gonna shoot you while I'm fin up.
Fin up, fin up, fin up, fin up to now.
