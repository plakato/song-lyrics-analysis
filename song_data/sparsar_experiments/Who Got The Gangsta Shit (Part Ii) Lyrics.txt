Who Got The Gangsta Shit (Part Ii) Lyrics
by Swoop G.


Swoop G talking.

From the city to the Town, and back to LBC.
You know this type of shit happens everyday.
You know it ain't no other state that do it quite like we.
Cuz this type of shit happens everyday.

Now who got the gangsta, gangsta twist?
S-W-double O-P-G back on yo list.
California rollin.
Choppin up game on Motorolas.
Tuck the pistola bendin the corner.
Burnin the doja I done told ya.
Livin this California street life.
Make a playa think twice.
Or get them three strikes.
An I'm knowin, you knowin that we ain't showin no fear.
Bangin and watchin the murder rate increase all year.
Is it true?
Do Crips C, bangin on the Bloods?
Or do California got that sticky bomb bud?
An bomb foes.
Pushin Lexo's.
Wearin fly clothes.
Fingers full of diamonds.
Wit diamonds in they nose.
An brown hair.
No derri're.
Sexy underwear.
An I'm knowin.
Cuz panty lines showin as I stare.
An all year.
Damn you makin love at first sight.
Baby you make a thug wanna love you tonight.

JT The Bigga Figga.
We got the situation.
We facin wit steady concentration.
Double six-duece produce.
So hear my gangstas conversate.
Hardtimer, we climbin, findin reasons.

And then there's papers needed.
I feel they cheated.
You leaded up out the viles wit multiple sacks, of dinero's.
Changin license plates on Yukon's.
And old Camero's.
Until they knocked my plug at DMV.
Had my P.O. in the Bauer give 'em all of me.
I'm a see.
In Long Beach tucked under.
Gettin my perve on for the whole fuckin summer.
From the Bay to L.A.
We showin nuthin but love.
Wit round trip tickets wit Swoop G an big Gov.

Gov you hit 'em up high.
JT an I hit 'em low.
Break 'em down to the lowest compound possible.
It ain't no stoppin.
When we droppin.
It's destined to hit the top.
Mashin for the Mobb.
Takin over this hip-hop.
Droppin hits to audiences.
Who's havin a fit.
Cuz they know the G's comin wit that gangsta twist.
An they love it.
Ain't nothin to it, but to do it.
I was born in Long Beach.
I'm a stay true to it.
Like a soldier.
Baby watch me show ya, I ain't a punk.
Roll the window down cover my strap then dump.

JT Tha Bigga Figga.
Bump, bump.
Hit 'em wit somethin heavy make they chest jump, jump.
B.A. they ain't ready for the funk.

It's the Mobb.
We don't bang.
But we roll wit hittas.
Peep the sickess.
I be the lyrical serpent that bit ya.
How could ya figure.
We ain't right Mobbin to the fullest.
So I break you back to the regular.
Ain't no competitors to us.
Who'd a knew us.
Flossin recruiters from Oakland, to Houston.
It's S-W-double O that be starrin your every movement.
Through the music.
We stack chips and break bread.
Keep it listenin.
I wreck yo set in every city.

Now you don't see what I see.
6 keys for a hundred g's.
I take a look in the mirror.
See myself livin the dream.
Takin over things, runnin million dolla schemes.
I got a vault safe.
That's full of hundred dolla stacks an all.
So I got sumpthin that'll lay you on yo back.
On the reala.
Slidin through the city and the Town.
Ain't no other way, but the way we put it down.

From the city to the Town.
And back to LBC.
You know it ain't no other state that do it quite like we.
Who me young Swoop.
And JT Tha Bigga Figga.
Ridin down.
Mashin wit the Gov young nigga.
