Low Class Conspiracy Lyrics
by Quasimoto.

Quasimoto.
Aiyyo we headed to a party to go see whats happening.
Smoking the Lah in the car turn on some rappin'.
Start to freestyle we be up on our way.
Finish up the blunt.

Madlib Somebody pass me that spray.

Quasimoto.
Get on the freeway yo its after dark.
And guess who always pull up right behind us.
Letting all kinds of speeding cars pass.
Just so they can harass our black asses.
The Police pulling us over for no reason.
Searching the car, like it's nigga hunting season.
Year round... asking.
about where's the pound...
Where's the gun, are y'all niggas on the run?
You got warrants?
Y'all niggas ready for some torment?
That's how they be cracking, it seems like they be actin'.
Except it's real life, like they rushing up your residence.
Searching your crib,.
they can't find no evidence.

Quasimoto.
The other day Mr. Buddha had this plan.
To get grands off the man so our whole crew could expand.
They all wanted me to drive the getaway car.
I was like fuck it, cause I ain't got no dough anyway.
They straight planned it right in my garage.
Thinkin' large.
Then they gathered the entourage.
My niggas straight hit the bank then broke the hell out.
So much money you.
couldn't even get that smell out.
I got laced with thirty G's.
To keep it freeze.
Plus a nigga ratted 5-0 far on a breeze.
Police talking about where's the dead presidents.
I said fuck y'all, niggas ain't got no evidence.
