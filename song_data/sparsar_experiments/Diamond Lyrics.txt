Diamond Lyrics
by Swift.

You tell me not to be me.
And you tell me.
That my love is so worthless--.

I can't hear the words that you tell me.
I can't hear them hear, them just let me go.

But you don't see inside of me.
And you can't judge what you can't understand.
And you laugh at my childlike dreams.
And think i'm better off in your scheme--.

You will never know what its all about.
Shut your fucking mouth.
Just shut your fucking mouth.
I can't hear the words that you tell me.
I can't hear them.
Just let me go.
But you don't see what im gonna be.
Im gonna be the man that you can't understand.
And you laugh at my foolish thoughts.
You'll wind up choking on the words you brought.

Because.
You will never know what its all about.
So shut your fucking mouth.
Just shut your fucking mouth.

I can't hear the words, that you tell me.
I can't hear them.
Just let me go.

I can't hear you-- hear me??

I can't hear the words, that you tell me--i can't.
Hear them, just let me go--but you don't see.
Inside of me, and you can't judge--what you can't.
Understand and you laugh at my childlike dreams.
And think i'm better of in your scheme--.

I can't hear you, fucking hear me.
I can't hear you, fucking hear me.
