Twenty Fourteen Lyrics
by A.Belief.

Tryna decide whether it's worth it, if we win or we lose  .
Spitting fire w my dogs, like we hell hounds  .
Never feeling a feeling, unless I'm feeling confused  .
  .
.
Is dampened w blood, sweat, &amp; most of all the pain  .
this  .
Catching the vibes, hands to the sky, beautiful clouds  .
All my niggas they can vibe to this &amp; all the women they can ride to.
I will never glorify they names  .
Ain't talked to God in so long, I'm prolly hell bound  .
The cloth from which I came  .
What do you choose, freedom or shoes, life in the nude  .
Trying to bloom in the darkest of rooms  .
  .
.
this.
Bringing light to my situation w the darkest of tunes  .
Still profound w pronouns  .
  .
Every day wishing we never see our face in the news  .
Since I had been detained  .
Cause I been pre-approved, my soul been rearranged  .
These ain't even tracks, just a compilation of moods  .
I haven't been the same ever since I moved out my hometown  .
All my niggas they can vibe to this &amp; all the women they can ride to.
