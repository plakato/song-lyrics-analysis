Chasing Faith Lyrics
by The Underachievers.

Produced by Nick Le√≥n.

So a nigga ain't have no direction.
Locked up in my own mental prison.
Suicide on my mind, no one listen.
Made a nigga remain so distant.
From the ones that could help me cope with it.
Heart closed nigga, feeling indifferent.
Can I stand on my own?
Pain on my dome, fucking up my zone.
Dreams surrounded in darkness, heartless.
Mind fucked up, thoughts littered with garbage.
Desolate minds, so my pace move lethargic.
All of this pain is what made me an artist.
Picked myself up off the ground.
Push a nigga forth where they chalk them out.
Need it to rain in my endless drought.
Cause all a nigga rivers filled up with doubt.
Free, free, let me tell you what I mean.
Cause a nigga grew up in the coldest of streets.
Hood real gutta, make ya fold up your dreams.
Old school system bring the clones from the weak.
Robbing, they stealing but the plot only thickens.
Cause the cops hitting niggas 'fore they reach for the phone.
Try intervention, but the confidence missing.
So they got all the children and they stripped off my hope.
Damn, damn, feeling like death.
Where do you turn when a nigga need help?
Trapped in your conscience, your conscience gon' melt.
You busy watching what they do and you fail.
I'm try'na show you that a nigga been there.
Crucify myself, a story to tell.
If you thinking that you stuck in a jail.
The key is in the room, you standing.
Right there.

When you lost in this world, man it's hard to relate.
And your back's on the wall, only choice is go straight.
Road signs, left, right, which path do you take?
Only one lead the way.
Tell me which one that's down for your faith.

Nigga, which path you gon' choose?
Both got they perks, but one is for the few.
Other is bright and gold and shining too.
Either one you pick, you win or you lose.
One is for the dark and one is for truth.
One will keep the voices, one is on mute.
One will keep you hanging inside a noose.
Other teach you all the ways to unloose.

AK the Savior.
Woke up from a dream we're still in.
Will we ever break free from these chains on skin?
Got an axe, in a flash we'll be back making sense.
Bring it back on her ass, mine blowing in the wind.
Bold thoughts of a king, go hard but fuck brain.
So hard to sustain, just a product of the game.
Young ace hit the safe, get involved with the snakes.
Pull your car, better keep a guard, niggas might take everything.
Had to clean my karma, now there ain't no drama.
Always felt like the target, with a chink in my armour.
I'm taking shit from my father, never listen, why bother?
Too lost in the ego, could've tried way farther.
Cause my dogs, they lethal, get a path, they eat you.
Had to get up, get out of the track they lead you.
But we live now, that Cali lifestyle, my eagles.
Had the wars peaceful, had to stop and eat full.
Used to bang with the dirt, quickly leave you blood stained.
Pants hanging and things changed, nigga fuck fame.
Through the pains.
they could see the sun cause we up late.
Hitting Jane,.
writing to the drugs, but the sub cray.
Remember thinking is this gonna pay off?
Is a nigga really gonna have to get a day job?
Till my niggas load the guns, hit the streets, then we mob.
No shoulder to lean on, to show my allegiance the worth of bond.
12 years old when I took my first toke.
Then I never looked back, since then been ghost.
Soul is gravitated to this shit that stayed away the most.
If my mama only knew about the shit that I indulged.
Would've been without a home, probably laid up with a stone.
Was a stinky little brat, stuffed packs under my stove.
Burning dodie in the crib, but Shhh, nobody knows.
Showing up to every period smelling like an O.

When you lost in this world, man it's hard to relate.
And your back's on the wall, only choice is go straight.
Road signs, left, right, which path do you take?
Only one lead the way.
Tell me which one distant from your faith.

Nigga, which path you gon' choose?
Both got they perks, but one is for the few.
Other is bright and gold and shining too.
Either one you pick, you win or you lose.
One is for the dark and one is for truth.
One will keep the voices, one is on mute.
One will keep you hanging inside a noose.
Other teach you all the ways to unloose.
