Kett≈ç Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


You lyrically losing.
I could be dead broke and still choosing.
Up on hoes but for you they throwing twos.
And i be.
Blunt crusing, making moves.
And when i get to the house i'm bruising hoes and wathcing news.
I'm a chill muhfugga till you step up on my shoes.
Thinking everything is cool.
Touching members of my crew.
First you talking all that peace.
Now ones pointed at you.
What you gon' do?
What you gon' do?

You hear the silent are the loudest.
The united are the proudest.
Night in and night out.
Divided, you lie down.
In silence, you cry now.
You lichen, need light now.
Wavy like a trident from poseidon.
Am i sight bound?
Recite lines into the confines of where light shines.
And pray that one day those lines.
Turn to dope rhymes.
Then to show times.
Then to gold mines.
I'm so tired, and i'm only still dreaming.
Said i'm so tired, so young but so tired.
Fuck you mean.

Young des, rolling stoned like a landslide.
Hit a lick on your b*tch, leave her hands tied.
Looking mad tired, but wired to a f-ckin' T.
Dropped a fucking tape.
Now all the shorties wanna fuck with me.
Reluctantly, i'm smoking blunts.
Ashin' on yo b*tch ass.
Wavy as a muh, think i'm kraken when i spit raps.
Verbal gift bags, some presence in the game.
Singing back then they didn't want me.
Now the hoes screaming my name.
Des.

Blue daze.
Blue jays.
New cuts.
Toupees.
Can't end like lupe.
My breached levee's your doomsday.
Not much like new pain.
They don't wanna hang like hussein.
How long before i have to wake up worried.
'bout my mother prematurely.
Fuck your boro's.
And even if she is to blame man....
Where the fuck your morals?

Take it.

But don't break it b*tch.
You talkin' all that cake and chips.
I'm makin' sense and takin' hits.
That wavy kid i'm sinking ships.
Acting like you dope.
But what's a gram to a zip?
Homie hand me the blunt 'cuz i ain't even tryna sip.
Got a bad one in my plans she told her man i'm the sh*t.
You just a mothafuggin fan.
I got my hands in her tits.
Said your swag is kind of bland.
But young des he rich.
B*tch.

Cough up the fortune like faces in belome's temple.
But keep the stardom.
It illuminates the dimple.
In the middle.
Of the cheek of the deville.
I mean devil.
Panorama 'round so we can see the weakening, we rebel.
That's all we really can do to stay intact.
Potential flow throughout our urinary tracts.
This rap sh*t is not the life i live.
But a tool that i'm using-that's it.
And this is all before my metamorphosis.

young des.

Cough syrup portions taken straight to the temple.
Sun god risen with some l.a. confidential.

tyler coolidge.

She say slither in like draco.
I smash it like canseco.
Chop her over on the table.
Drop the halo.
I'm fuego.

young des.
I feel like flacko coming for the pesos.
All i spit is dope.
Put the speaker to your nasal.

tyler coolidge.

Prince of the cherry blossoms.
Ruler of the rain.
Young coolidge.
Young des.
On the scene.
What you mean?
