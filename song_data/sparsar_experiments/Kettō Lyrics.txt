Kett≈ç Lyrics
by Tyler coolidge.


You lyrically losing 
I could be dead, broke and still choosing 
Up on hoes, but for you they throwing twos 
And. I be 
Blunt crusing, making moves 
And. When i get to the house, i'm bruising hoes and wathcing news 
I'm a chill muhfugga till you step up on my shoes. 
Thinking everything is cool. 
Touching members of my crew, 
First, you talking all that peace. 
Now ones pointed at you 
What you gon' do 
What! You gon' do 
 
You hear the silent are the loudest 
The united, are the proudest 
Night in and night out 
Divided. You lie down, 
In silence, you cry now: 
You lichen need light. Now, 
Wavy like a trident from poseidon 
Am. I sight bound 
Recite lines into the confines of where light shines, 
And pray that one day those lines 
Turn to dope rhymes 
Then, to show times 
Then to gold mines, 
I'm, so tired, and i'm only still dreaming 
Said, i'm so tired, so young, but so tired 
Fuck. You mean 
 
Young des rolling stoned like a landslide 
Hit, a lick on your b*tch leave her hands tied, 
Looking, mad, tired but wired to a f-ckin' T, 
Dropped, a fucking tape, 
Now all the shorties wan na fuck with me, 
Reluctantly, i'm smoking blunts 
Ashin' on yo B*Tch ass 
Wavy as a muh think i'm kraken when i spit raps 
Verbal gift bags, some presence in the game 
Singing back. Then they didn't want me 
Now the hoes screaming my name: 
Des 
, 
Blue daze, 
Blue jays 
New cuts 
Toupees 
Can't end like lupe 
My breached levee's your doomsday 
Not, much like new pain, 
They, don't wan na hang like hussein. 
How long before i have to wake up worried 
'bout my mother prematurely 
Fuck, your boro's 
And. Even if she is to blame man, ... 
Where, the fuck, your morals, 
 
Take, it 
 
But, don't break it. B*Tch 
You talkin'. All that cake and chips, 
I'm, makin' sense and takin' hits 
That wavy kid. I'M sinking, ships 
Acting like you dope, 
But. What'S a gram to a zip 
Homie hand me the blunt'cuz, i ain't, even tryna, sip 
Got, a bad one. In my plans she told her man, i'm the sh*t 
You. Just a mothafuggin fan 
I got my hands in her tits 
Said. Your swag is kind of bland 
But young des he rich 
B*tch 
 
Cough up the fortune like faces in belome's temple 
But, keep the stardom 
It illuminates the dimple 
In, the middle 
Of, the cheek of the deville 
I mean devil 
Panorama'round. So we can see the weakening. We rebel 
That's. All we really can do to stay intact. 
Potential flow throughout our urinary tracts, 
This rap sh*t is not the life. I live 
But, a tool that i'm using-that's it 
And. This is all before my metamorphosis: 
 
young des 
 
Cough syrup portions, taken straight to the temple 
Sun, god risen with some l.a. confidential 
, 
tyler, coolidge, 
, 
She, say slither in like draco 
I smash it like canseco 
Chop her over on the table, 
Drop the halo 
I'M fuego 
 
young des 
I feel like flacko coming for the pesos 
All i spit is dope 
Put the speaker to your nasal 
 
tyler coolidge 
 
Prince of the cherry blossoms 
Ruler of the rain 
Young coolidge 
Young des 
On, the scene 
What you mean
