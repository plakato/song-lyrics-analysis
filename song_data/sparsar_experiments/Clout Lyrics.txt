Clout Lyrics
by Yung Swift.


My team winning thats, no doupt 
 
And. These niggas got no clout, 
 
Roll up the dope, and i smoke now: 
 
I ben the foreign lets roll out, 
 
He pull out and he show out 
 
I, say 45 and she gon na go now. 
 
My team winning thats, no doupt 
 
And. These niggas got no clout, 
 
TGE. They some problems. Nigga 
 
4 rounds make us drop a nigga 
 
If. He run his mouth. Then we gon na stop a nigga 
 
If. He keep talkin. We gon na pop a nigga 
 
Hateing niggas trynna roll wit me
