Come thou long expected jesus Lyrics
by Wolves At The Gate.

Come Thou Long Expected Jesus.
Come, Thou long-expected Jesus, born to set Thy people free.
From our fears and sins release us.
Let us find our rest in Thee.
Israel's strength and consolation, hope of all the earth Thou art.
Dear desire of every nation, joy of every longing heart.

Joy to those who long to see thee, Day spring from on high, appear.
Come, thou promised Rod of Jesse, of thy birth we long to hear.
Over the hills the angels singing news, glad tidings of a birth.
Go to him, your praises bringing.
Christ the Lord has come to earth.

Come to earth to taste our sadness, he whose glories knew no end.
By his life he brings us gladness, our Redeemer, Shepherd, Friend.
Leaving riches without number, born within a cattle stall.
This the everlasting wonder, Christ was born the Lord of all.

Born Thy people to deliver, born a child, and yet a King.
Born to reign in us forever, now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
By Thine own eternal Spirit rule in all our hearts alone.
By Thine own sufficient merit, raise us to Thy glorious throne.
