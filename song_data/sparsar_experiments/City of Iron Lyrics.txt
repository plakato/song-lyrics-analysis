City of Iron Lyrics
by Unleash the Archers.

I have awakened from the sorrow.
My tarnished soul renewed immortal, Crawling to life.
And as the horror animated.
Manifests I'm recreated, All doubt aside.

Step away from the strife, Embrace the rising tide.

In the rays of the starlight, I will rise, Divine Empire.
In the rays of the starlight, she will shine, City of Iron.

Deathlessness is the curse that I bear.
One thousand deaths on my sleeve is the cross that I wear.

Discern this fortress cast of metal.
A citadel for dusk to settle, stronghold of hate.
A stark reflection of my power.
Hid within a sable tower, marshal my fate.

Step away from the strife, Embrace the rising tide.

I am the omen, Fatal harbinger.
All beware, Days are numbered.

I'll part the shadows, let control fade away, planets align.
Celestial arsenal, steel-plated galaxy, moons lit afire.

Step away from the strife, Embrace the rising tide.
