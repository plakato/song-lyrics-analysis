resent.
I'm gonna cement my spot so get bent and stop.

This is one flow you just can't beat.
We all know what you beat.
You got the appeal of wet concrete.

I'm gonna slash and gash and rip another hole in your ass.
I'll smear blood on the walls play tennis with your balls.
And when the phone rings don't answer the call.
I'll slit your throat kill you like a GOAT.
I'll rip your foreskin off and wear it as a winter coat.
