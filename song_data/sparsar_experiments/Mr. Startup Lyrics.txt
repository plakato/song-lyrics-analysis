Mr. Startup Lyrics
by Wolf Parade.

Danny says he's quit designing clothes.
He's getting into jazz and staying home.
He is like Picasso drawing in the sand.

Blessed be the ones who let their blessings go.
Blessed be the ones who let their blessings go.

Danny got a sampler and saxophone.
He made a seven second loop.
And let it play while he painted pictures for eighty hours.

Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.

He has discovered the existence of Mr. Startup.
And is depicting him in lavender and gold.
Now all the idle hands of the factory have been told.
Blessed be the ones who let their blessings go.

Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.
Up come the flowers.

Danny said he's quit designing clothes.

Blessed be the ones who let their blessings go.
Blessed be the ones who let their blessings go.
Blessed be the ones who let their blessings go.
