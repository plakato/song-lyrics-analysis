A World Without Lyrics
by Queensr√øche.

Voices whisper in the night.
Do you hear them calling me.
Reflecting faces in the light.
What is real and what is fantasy.

Nowhere to be found, I can't breathe again.
A mother, my lover, my best friend, my best friend.
My baby's staring back at me, and now a broken family.
Your name now etched in stone, no place to call my home.

Your heart is the amber I see in my drag.
The smoke your spirit rising I breathe your love.
The tickle in my throat, your way of reaching out.
Perhaps the creaking of my door.
The moonlight glistening the shore.

Nowhere to be found, I can't breathe again.
A mother, my lover, my best friend, my best friend.
My baby's staring back at me, and now a broken family.
Your name now etched in stone, no place to call my home.

Nowhere to be found,.
I can't breathe again.
A mother, my lover, my best friend, my best friend.

My baby's staring back at me, and now a broken family.
Your name now etched in stone, no place to call my home.
