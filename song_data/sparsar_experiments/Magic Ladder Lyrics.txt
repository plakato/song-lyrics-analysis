Magic Ladder Lyrics
by Viza.

I found a magic ladder.
I see the pharaohs' feast on vagabonds.

I have a magic ladder.
It takes me where I want and when I want.

I climbed this magic ladder.
I saw the hands of God tied in a knot.

I have a magic ladder.
He asked me to stay back so he can mummify!

Love me like the very day you met me.
Or at the very least protect me.
From the lepers on your bed.
Love me like the very way you left me, Love me.
Or at the very least transcend me.
To a different time or place.

One at a time I will climb.
One at a time like good wine.
One at a time I'll refine.
One at a time, every time!
