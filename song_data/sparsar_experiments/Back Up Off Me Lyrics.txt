Back Up Off Me Lyrics
by U.N.L.V..


Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead.
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled.
But ain't no rats around because the U is in the clear.
So watch yo back mutherfucker cuz I'm creepin' up on ya from the rear.

{Tec-9}.

I'm sick of them mutherfuckers with that ho shit.
Make yo self known and stop talkin' from an distance.
I remember back to this round 1992.
Some niggas called me up sayin' we startin' a group.
Yeah I gave it a try but I was in it to win it.
Them niggas started somethin' they could not finish.
Now I got to move on so I signed with Cash Money.
Now I got some niggas who want to look at me funny.
But yo I ain't even gonna let them niggas step.
If they start to rep I'm gonna rep mutherfucker.

But I ain't got nothin' to say since ya pissed me off.
It's best to get yo monkey ass out of my fuckin' way.
A lot of people dislike me but they don't understand.
They the one's who really made me you can hate me forever.
I'm makin' money from yo head you can take this bounce.
To another level Cash Money is in effect If ya got a probelm.
Mutherfucker it's yo self you got to check.
I represent that fuckin' uptown.
Through the circumstances and the difficulties in the rap game.
Niggas be comin' with ho shit makin' it harder for next man.
I'm takin' a stand mutherfuck the next nigga.
Because ya got a plan with no heart.
I'm only down with them niggas who was down with me from the.
Very start ya sayin' this ya sayin' that.
The actual fact ya only lookin' for a way out.
So back up off me.

Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead.
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled.
But ain't no rats around because Tec-9 is in the clear.
So watch yo back mutherfucker cuz I'm creepin' up on ya from the rear.

{Lil' Ya}.

Damn why they fuckin' with an nigga.
Ya not on the map but yet makin' yo name bigger.
You and that ho shit you know you don't mean it.
But if ya want some drama won't ya step to Ya bitch.
Ya talkin' bad about a nigga bitch get yo mind right.
Put down yo guns and let's begin to fight.
Cuz I'm a gangster and ya know I'm true to the game.
Test my nuts anyway to see if I'm lame.
I got muscle comin' strong gee.
Tellin' this o'l mark ass gangstas.
To back up off me.

Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead.
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled.
But ain't no rats around because Lil' Ya is in the clear.
So watch yo back nigga cuz I'm creepin' up on ya from the rear.

{Yella Boy}.

Now a days I'm comin' round but it's cool ya see.
Still a ho ass mutherfuker better act ya like ya know fool.
Ya better step correct because I'm gonna put yo ass in check.
Comin' stompin' out the third you the U is in effect.
Nigga I still thought niggas livin' violent kimo by by my side.
If ya ever slip my pass that mean yo ass want to die.
I'm tellin' you like this cuz yall niggas makin' me pissed.
Ya fuckin' with the Cash Money ya gonna get yo damn head split.
Jealous bitches here boo-koo jealous bitches there.
My nigga Lil' Slim say shake yo ass up in a minute.
Bitch I started off strong I bet ten that's how finish.
What kind of nigga try'na go for his bitches be try'na stop me.
All upset they need to find them some dick.
But I'm gonna let the fuckin' pressure grow.
Suckin' makin' me strong slippin' with that ho shit.
Don't ya know I got pussy c'mon to me bitches on my.
Dick and that is that B-32 and Suga Fingers keepin' things tight.
That's an fact  I got the six and b mob by my side.
So watch yo back here come an mutherfuckin' drive by.
Loadin' the gat's we got to be strapped packin' the gat's.
Can't get trapped steppin' hoes checkin' a nigga with my bozack.
Why I got to keep on tellin' you not to battle me.
When ya know one thing that you can never pay me back.
So bitch get off me.

Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead.
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled.
