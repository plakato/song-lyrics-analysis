Taser Gun Lyrics
by Yung La.

Oh, fu fu futuristic lead line.
Futuristic lead line.
I mean.

Da first time I saw dat girl I was like WHOA.
Lookin` like a model everytime she strike a pose.
I be lookin` good up in my sun sixty coupe.
See I was blowing purple smoke all about da roof.
My number in her pocket so you know she gon` call.
When she hit da phone dawg know we bout to ball.
Money in my pocket girl everythin` good.
Tats on my face you can tell Iâ€™m from da hood.
Nevermind dat, ima let you meet the team.
Let you meet tip I be rockin wit da king.
Grand hustle girl yeah everything cozier.
Get ya in da bed and ima do you like a poster.
For real.

She called me so ago.
Got me feelin like oh my God.
Shawty shot me.
Shawty got me.
Shawty shot me like a taser gun.
My numbers in her pocket.
Iâ€™m spaced out like a rocket.
Shawty shot me.
Shawty got me.
Shawty shot me like a taser gun.

I'ma try hit shawty like a high note.
I wanna die baby girl and do the back stroke.
Shawty got it in, shawty shot it in.
Shawty pull da taser gun I done shot it in.
Light skin long hair dats the beauty queen.
She the kinda girl you see up on da movie screen.
She the kinda girl make you wanna call a wife.
She got it on and thatâ€™s the kinda girl that I like.
She a dime piece, she a diva too.
She like the true religion jeans wit the prada boots.
Shawty say she like me.
Cuz I'm from the Ville.
She want a yung fly guy imagine what it is.
