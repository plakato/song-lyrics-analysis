I done take very best girl of mine, yeah.
I done take very best girl of mine, yeah.
Gonna straighten up, baby, stop that cheatin' and lyin'.

The way you lied about me, you lied about Louie's too, yeah.

You lied about me, you lied abut Louie's too.

You got me feeling so bad, I don't what to do.

Let me tell you woman, lay deep down inside.
Baby, baby, hold you by my side.
Cause I love you, I love you.
Cause I love you, I love you.
Cause I love you, cause I love you.
Cause I love you, yes, I love you.
Cause I love you and I never let you go.

Come on, come on, baby, come home, baby, come on now.
Baby, come home, baby, come on now.
Come on go home.

Let me tell you, well, I'm hurt, well, I'm hurt deep down inside.
Baby, baby, hold you by my side.
Cause I love you, I love you.
Cause I love you, I love you.
Cause I love you, cause I love you.
Cause I love you, yes, I love you.
Cause I love you and I never let you go.

Hey, hey, everything'll be alright.
Hey, hey, everything'll be alright.
Hey, hey, everything'll be alright.

Hey, hey, everything'll be alright.
Hey, hey, everything'll be alright.
Hey, hey, everything'll be alright.
