Dis-Organ-Ized Lyrics
by Blood Duster.

Prone on the operating table.
Deep incision sliced on inanimate flesh.
I love my disgusting equipment.
Needles, scalpels, and brain scoops to diagnose death.
Succumb to my horrible experiment.
Intestines &amp; limbs agog in fiendish disarray.
Mutating your natural composition.
Rearrange your vital organs in horrific dismay.

I'm the ghoul of the medical profession.
Foetid corpses and carcasses line the basement wall.
With glee I dismember cadavers.
I affix the pancreas where stomach should be.
Rejuvenate the rancid corpses.
The innards glisten in their new anatomical display.
I cackle with post-mortem delight.
The walls reek of sin &amp; the stench of horrendous decay...
