Diamond Shoes Lyrics
by Zodiac.

See so swinger in your business suit.
With the bucks for your love and her shining shoes.
Five star motel she wanna run in bell.
Cuff down with her little song trail.

Shut up now, shut up now, shut up.
Shut up now, shut up now, shut up.
Shut up now, shut up now, shut up.
Shut up now, you'll soon be around.
Diamond shoes with a little blues.
Diamond shoes on a little bit on you.
Diamond shoes with a little blues.
Sex sound of the inner blues.
Played your suit now don't be shy.
Join the wonder who why your love.
Don't be late for the god damn cars.
Justice done behind the bars.

Ain't no justice, oh no.
Ain't no justice for sure.
You can run but you can't hide.
But forgiveness you'll never find.
Diamond shoes with a little blues.
Diamond shoes on a little bit on you.
Diamond shoes with a little blues.
Sex sound of the inner blues.
Oh you.
