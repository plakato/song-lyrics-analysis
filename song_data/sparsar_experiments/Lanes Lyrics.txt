Lanes Lyrics
by Yuna.


Why, do you keep tellin' me? You'Re self-destructing, 
I'm, gettin', tired of your lies and your excuses. 
Cause. I see your photos in the club, 
Havin' fun and litted up 
Someone famous on the couch 
You. Don'T answer when I call 
Can't talk now cause it's too loud. 
What, am I doin' with this drama, 
 
If? This is love, I don't want it 
If. This is love. You can keep it 
You call this love, you don't respect it 
If. This is love. Why am I hurting 
 
At the end of the day? 
While? You are with me 
We're on different lanes, 
Chasing different things, 
 
And. You know that I don't do that 
Would, you like it. If I start doin' that 
Social climbin' on the daily 
Don't give a damn'bout what you think 
Would you like it. If I start to change 
Cause, I wonder what you did to me: 
Takin' up space, so you can be free 
Cause. I didn't give you what you need 
 
If. This is love. I don't want it 
If. This is love. You can keep it 
You call. This love, you don't respect it 
If. This is love. Why am I hurting 
 
At the end of the day? 
While? You are with me 
We're on different lanes, 
Chasing different things, 
 
If, you got a good girl, then appreciate it. 
A wife-material then appreciate it. 
If. You got a good girl, then appreciate it. 
A wife-material then appreciate it. 
 
At the end of the day. 
While you are with me 
We're on different lanes, 
Chasing different things, 
At the end of the day. 
_Cause. I see your photos in the club_ 
While. You are with me 
We're on different lanes: 
_Are you having fun _
