Lanes Lyrics
by Yuna.


Why do you keep tellin' me you're self-destructing?
I'm gettin' tired of your lies and your excuses.
Cause I see your photos in the club.
Havin' fun and litted up.
Someone famous on the couch.
You don't answer when I call.
Can't talk now cause it's too loud.
What am I doin' with this drama?

If this is love, I don't want it.
If this is love, you can keep it.
You call this love, you don't respect it.
If this is love, why am I hurting?

At the end of the day.
While you are with me.
We're on different lanes.
Chasing different things.

And you know that I don't do that.
Would you like it if I start doin' that?
Social climbin' on the daily.
Don't give a damn 'bout what you think.
Would you like it if I start to change?
Cause I wonder what you did to me.
Takin' up space so you can be free.
Cause I didn't give you what you need.

If this is love, I don't want it.
If this is love, you can keep it.
You call this love, you don't respect it.
If this is love, why am I hurting?

At the end of the day.
While you are with me.
We're on different lanes.
Chasing different things.

If you got a good girl then appreciate it.
A wife-material then appreciate it.
If you got a good girl then appreciate it.
A wife-material then appreciate it.

At the end of the day.
While you are with me.
We're on different lanes.
Chasing different things.
At the end of the day.
_Cause I see your photos in the club_.
While you are with me.
We're on different lanes.
_Are you having fun?_.
