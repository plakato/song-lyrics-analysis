Wavy Lyrics
by Ty Dolla $ign.


When I wake up in the morning I roll up and count my money 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy 
All. My bitches love me. They gon' answer for a real one, 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy 
, 
, Ty, Dolla $ ign 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy 
All. These bitches wan na have my babies 
I'm so handsome I'm so ballin'. 
Must. Be why all my ex's calling 
I'm so wavy in the turbo Porsche 
She, so wavy in the new Mercedes 
Independent chick yeah, that my type of lady 
She ain't never asked. But I did it for my baby 
Wavy like Beyonc√© on a surfboard 
I'm getting money, but she worth more 
She can get it when she want it. 
I'M so wavy that I need a red carpet. 
 
When I wake up in the morning I roll up and count my money 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy 
All. My bitches love me. They gon' answer for a real one, 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy 
 
Too many niggas wan na be him 
I'm, so wavy in these red Timb's 
Rolex arm neck wrist, chest 
Baby, mama's friend she next 
Dial 1-800. When you need me 
On, my ABC you'll, never be a G 
Check. My range, I'm Stephen. When you need a three 
I, give her strokes for days and when she need D, 
Shawty wan na ride with a surf god, 
Lil nigga got more than her ex got. 
Lil purse cost more than your next guy 
Tell. Your friends don't play cause at sex. I Suwop 
The motherfucking man, where I come from 
A lot. Pussy done ran when I come for it. 
Dab hoes I be Cam. When I come forward. 
If you ever in the gym and you looking for a bam. I drum it. 
 
When I wake up in the morning I roll up and count my money 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy 
All. My bitches love me. They gon' answer for a real one, 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy,

My dogs go brazy. Oh so brazy, 
My, car, so wavy, my closet, so wavy 
My, new chick, so wavy. That ass is amazing 
And. She know what I came here for 
 
When, I wake up in the morning I roll up and count my money 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy 
All. My bitches love me. They gon' answer for a real one, 
I'm, so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.
