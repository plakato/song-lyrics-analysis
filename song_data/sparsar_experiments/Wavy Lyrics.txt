Wavy Lyrics
by Ty Dolla $ign.


When I wake up in the morning I roll up and count my money.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.
All my bitches love me, they gon' answer for a real one.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.

Ty Dolla $ign.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.
All these bitches wanna have my babies.
I'm so handsome, I'm so ballin'.
Must be why all my ex's calling.
I'm so wavy in the turbo Porsche.
She so wavy in the new Mercedes.
Independent chick, yeah that my type of lady.
She ain't never asked but I did it for my baby.
Wavy like Beyonc√© on a surfboard.
I'm getting money but she worth more.
She can get it when she want it.
I'm so wavy that I need a red carpet.

When I wake up in the morning I roll up and count my money.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.
All my bitches love me, they gon' answer for a real one.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.

Too many niggas wanna be him.
I'm so wavy in these red Timb's.
Rolex arm neck wrist chest.
Baby mama's friend, she next.
Dial 1-800 when you need me.
On my ABC, you'll never be a G.
Check my range, I'm Stephen when you need a three.
I give her strokes for days and when she need D.
Shawty wanna ride with a surf god.
Lil nigga got more than her ex got.
Lil purse cost more than your next guy.
Tell your friends don't play cause at sex I Suwop.
The motherfucking man where I come from.
A lot pussy done ran when I come for it.
Dab hoes, I be Cam when I come forward.
If you ever in the gym and you looking for a bam, I drum it.

When I wake up in the morning I roll up and count my money.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.
All my bitches love me, they gon' answer for a real one.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.

I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.
My dogs go brazy, oh so brazy.
My car so wavy, my closet so wavy.
My new chick so wavy, that ass is amazing.
And she know what I came here for.

When I wake up in the morning I roll up and count my money.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.
All my bitches love me, they gon' answer for a real one.
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy.
