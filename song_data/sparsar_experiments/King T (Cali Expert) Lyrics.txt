King T (Cali Expert) Lyrics
by The Union.

Ha hah.
No deezee, heh.

When they need work, they call the cali drug expert.
Smashin in a six hundred dollar ?bill burnt?
Lookin flossy, livin costly, and off the edge.
Out of state, they gots to break bread fo' sho'.
I needs mo', ice drops for the Lex-o.
Baguette sets glow when I'm stippin the Mo'.
Freelancin, tryin to build a mansion and stay faded.
Have hoes walk around my crib buttnaked.
The gravy train, chronic got me losin my brain.
But soothin my pain, I'm true to the game.
I got my mind made, I gotta be that rich motherfucker.
Set it up, so my grandkids don't suffer.
The fat Hummer, the fat drummer what's your choice.
Tryin to find a sister with a voice, make her moist.
My thirst runs deeps as Lake Tahoe.
In the black Tahoe.
911 codes all over the Bravo.
Ain't nuttin but tabledancers and strip models, they bring bottles.
But trip, niggas at parties grabbin they best friend.
Tryin to dodge, from the Aftermath entourage.
No camouflage, fine linen, fine women.
Busters get slugs in em.
I twist my spliffs with the green, I make a sick scene.
Scream through some six by nines and fifteens.
Tighten my rhymes like bitch jeans.
Mix my dimes with ginseng, controllin this thing.
Rock on, get your ride on when you hear it.
The forbidden gangland lyrics.
Playa haters fear it, get you right up close near it.
Posessed by the Eazy-E spirit.
Dr. Dre set the limit, and niggas won't cross this line.
It's suicide, and niggas won't cross this line.
In your mouth, puffin with my niggas down South.
What the fuck it's really all about me.
I'm comin out, front and back, ninety-eight Brougham.
All you fake G's stay home.
Leave the shit alone, King T's back on the throne.
And my niggas on the mic straight gone, CRAZAY.
Y'all niggas wanna know the real deal?
I freestyle and smack you in your grill.
Bomb lyrics, no special effects or gimmicks.
The Aftermath'll put you in the mix, beyotch!

Hah, Organized Rhyme in effect.
Peace to my nigga Nino.
