Together or Separate Lyrics
by Visionaries.

LMNO.
Believe what you will - entitled.
I'm a complice receiving direction, guided.
In a conversation, interaction with others.
Hasn't spread the word, effect no longer.
Agnostic, seed, soil, rain and sunlight.
Crews think God is day and night.
BC to AD, DJ play V.
Religiously, simultaneously.

Key-Kool.
New identities for every time I grow.
Discovery my character when it's myself I know.
Rockin' every show, showin' I'm improvin'.
With my flow I'm movin', emotions I am soothin'.
To the soul and the mind and the mental elevation.
Underneath forty trees in meditation.
Still tryin' to resist temptations.
Reflectin' life by recreating creations.

LMNO.
A changed lifestyle like Saul to Paul.
I'm not actin' appalled if the movement stalls.
Own fault, accept that.
borderline haemorrhagin'.
Severin' all ties, sayin' like goodbyes.
Momentum compliments, we can't prevent them.
Energy burnin', keep on growin'.
Turning tables without spike, I'm now knowin'.
Get back what you give, invest in a hug.
Those tatoos told me he's not even a thug.
Those bodily ornaments make her a pink cushion.
Their pockets are buffed from the weight they been pushin'.

Key-Kool.
I can go out in an instant.
Wiped out from my physical existence.
LMNO.
Hey, don't dish us no resistance.
Cause we're all about persistence.
Key-Kool }.
Assistance to witness, take a stand, right over wrong.
Without a pipe or a bong I'm feelin' Most High.
Most tried to deny livin' in a lie.
Until right before they die realize they're gonna fry.

both.
Guess, take a guess.
Who's comin' with the mic bless.
With the positive hypeness.
V-i-s-i-o-n-a-r-i-e-s with emphasis.
On less of the typical rip-it flow.
A video could never replace a live show.
Ohio to all of those wakin' up.
Selfishness gets groups breakin' up.
Guess, take a guess.
Who's comin' with the mic bless.
With the positive hypeness.
V-i-s-i-o-n-a-r-i-e-s with emphasis.
On less of the typical rip-it flow.
A video could never replace the real thing.
to all of those wakin' up.
Selfishness gets groups breakin' up.
Selfishness gets groups broken up.
Selfishness gets groups broken up.
