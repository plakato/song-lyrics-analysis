Nothing Lyrics
by Zug Izland.

Shot down your instincts, turned into a freak.
You said this was your first time.
How fast changes come for you to finally see.
Shallow plains for you to find what you....

There's nothing left!
For me on this ride.
There's something left!
With you by my side.
There's nothing left!

Noooo nothing left....

Stuck in with no way out a gift for your grief.
Shattered your thoughts of a good thing that you never had.
Hopelessly knowing whats right or wrong.
Can't stop the feeling, it comes so strong.

There's nothing left!
For me on this ride.
There's something left!
With you by my side.
There's nothing left!

Noooo....

Observe nature from a black top view.
Left you defenseless hoping for defeat.
Built on my fears.
Confession of obsession.
One day happy place for you to hide.

There's nothing left!
For me on this ride.
There's something left!
With you by my side.
There's nothing left!
There's nothing left!
For me on this ride.
There's something left for me!
With you by my side.
There's nothing left!
With this ghost on my side!
There's something left.
With you in my life!
There's nothing left!

Nothing left, nooo....
