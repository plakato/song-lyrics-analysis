30 (Deluxe Album Version) (New Recording) Lyrics
by Twisted Sister.

Well we never had the time to plan our life past 30.
We were bullet proof, through the roof, nothing could ever hurt it.
Never gave a damn about the other side of the hill.
Nothing could stop us, nothing ever will.
And when we hit the stage, Lord you'd never know.
30 came and went a long time a go.

We rocked the 80's like we thought they would never end.
We can still bring the house down like we did way back when.
We can cuss, we can fight, we can go all night.
Still tear it up even though.
30 came and went a long, long time ago.

We were 25, so alive, nothing but the road on our minds.
It was a rocked out, knocked out, sold out show every time - know that.
We were jukebox dreaming and that life we make our stand.
Burning through the night, headed for the promise land - you know where that.
is.
Well we must've lost track of time cause we didn't know.
30 came and went a long time ago.

We rocked the 80's like we thought they would never end.
We can still bring the house down like we did way back when.
We can cuss, we can fight, we can go all night.
Still tear it up even though.
30 came and went a long, long time ago.

We rocked the 80's like we thought they would never end.
We can still bring the house down like we did way back when.
We can cuss, we can fight, we can go all night.
Still tear it up even though.
30 came and went a long, long time ago.
We can cuss, we can fight, we can go all night.
With the help of pharmaceuticals.
30 came and went a long, long time ago.

And the 60's up ahead, yes it is....
