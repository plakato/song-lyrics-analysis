You Need It Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


As I creep through the shady tower, I tuck a piece of ambition in my lucky.
trousers.
My momma told me not to lose it, it lies with me but it's still the truest.
I love it how it keep me warm, I hate it how it keeps me torn.
Lately it's been doing well, staying afloat now I get to sail.
Yeah, hopefully I get to sell, hopefully you wish me well.
Well, want me to fail to your aching bones.
I know you ain't the type to drown alone.

I'mma keep it one hundred with niggas cause you need it.
Revolutionary nigga give me all those keezes.
I'm locking the future I'mma pick it with my thesis.
Thank me whenever nigga I told you that you need it.

Spitting like camels I'm illy to my enamel.
Reality in a box, you rushing to change channels.
Know that you feel it from another city, I know.
I wonder if they wanna fuck with me.
Kinda sorta as long as I stay in order.
Try to keep it level, I'm constantly switching floors.
Hide me from the truth these niggas is Dumbledore.
I want so many lovers they rumble arena floors.
Dreaming since my toddlers.
Push me to a future that's now a past to my fathers.
Even though he wish me luck, I could read the subtext.
Wanna see me graduate, just another subject.

Humble as pie, I'm cooling your self esteem.
Kind of ironic nigga like watching yourself dream.
Snotty nose when hitting these pot holes.
Take me from the trouble of getting my car towed.
Relateable that's a fact, I'm knowing how it is I don't wanna go back.
Nope, and I don't wanna be whack.
Don't wanna move into a mansion then move into a flat.
Progressive as the time clicks.
Inside I found my light switch.
Don't wanna get distracted by them light skins.
These hoes is fine but not fine enough to pay rent.
