A Rose for Emily [Alternate Take][*] Lyrics
by The Zombies.

The summer is here at last.
The sky is overcast.
And no one brings a rose for Emily.
She watches her flowers grow.
While lovers come and go.
To give each other roses from her tree.
But not a rose for Emily.
Emily, can't you see.
There's nothing you can do?
There's loving everywhere.
But none for you.
Her roses are fading now.
She keeps her pride somehow.
That's all she has protecting her from pain.
And as the years go by.
She will grow old and die.
The roses in her garden fade away.
Not one left for her grave.
Not a rose for Emily.
Emily, can't you see.
There's nothing you can do?
There's loving everywhere.
But none for you.
Her roses are fading now.
She keeps her pride somehow.
That's all she has protecting her from pain.
And as the years go by.
She will grow old and die.
The roses in her garden fade away.
Not one left for her grave.
Not a rose for Emily.
