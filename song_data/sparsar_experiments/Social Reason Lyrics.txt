Social Reason Lyrics
by The Undead.


Did you see that face.
On the cover of the Village Voice?
How'd it get there?
Who made the choice?
There's a social reason.
For who goes far.
A social reason.
For who's a star.
See that person.
At the front of the line.
Hey, that space.
Used to be mine.
And there's a social reason.
Why I'm not there.
A social reason.
And it's not fair.
If you've got the right contacts.
You can have the wrong act.
Cause you know and who you screw.
Is more important than what you do.
Hey!
See that name.
In big, bold print?
How'd it get there?
Here's a hint.
There's a social reason.
Why it's there.
And there's a social reason.
And it's not fair.
There's a social reason.
Why I'm not there.
A social reason.
And it's not fair.
