Animal Lyrics
by Wonderstarz.

Song by Sponny Bee.

Baby you do things to me I can't comprehend.
You're an animal - Give it up.
Don't pretend.

She's like magic - I can feel the tingle in my nerves.
The chill up my spine.
Pants contain a hard-on.
She's a spot-on girl - don' beat around the bush.
But I'll be a liar if I said did the same too.
She's like a fairy who didn't get lucky in heaven.
She's one girl I can fall in love for ages, and.
Her story in my diary'll fill pages, and.
She's the mystifying character who just doesn't get me.
Hit me, baby if you want.
Pick me, throw me - if you think I'm wrong.
Punish  - Here's the whip.
If you think I'm hiding stuff, feel free to strip.

She's the girl.
I just can't get over.
She's like dust.
A sec-and then.
Blows....

...away.
I can' stay - I'm beginning to feel the pain.
One last time baby.
Tell me what changed.
I don't understand - is this some kinda game?
I joked around sometimes, but now I ain't.
I want answers - fuck my fame!
I can go on record for you, my dame.
My darling, my honey from Himalayan nectar.
Solving your riddles are like Bond figuring out SPECTRE.

I can never ever say that thing -.
The thing that I said to you.

It doesn't matter what I think and do.
The only one babe - I want YOU.

I can be a li'l itty bit weird.
But the person who finds it cute is you.

I may be the King, then you the Queen -.
It's true!

I try to divert my path - bends to you....

Yes, it's true - I love you.
Love me back or not.
I'll still call you 'Boo'.
The illusion.
Who trapped me like a fly in its sticky web.
But now it feels alright! Ooh!
I don't mind you saying No.
But judging me by my face - that's just Boo!
I'm getting down on my knees.
Not on FB....
Two li'l magic words - it's reality.

She's the girl.
I just can't get over.
She's like dust.
A sec-and then.
Blows....

She's the girl.
I just can't get over.
She's like dust.
A sec-and then.
Blows away....
