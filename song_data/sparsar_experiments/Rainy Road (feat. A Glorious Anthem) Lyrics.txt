Rainy Road (feat. A Glorious Anthem) Lyrics
by Wonder Bred.


Chris... Chriiis....
Chris... Chriiis....

Close your eyes, leave behind the past.
Be there, join me in the grass.
X2.

Wait... Listen to the Drip Drop.
I paint... Pictures with Hip Hop.

Close your eyes. Imagine with your mind.
Shimmer of Summer Sunshine.
Grimmer gray rain sometimes.

Picture a place, filled with laughter and pastures to graze.
Or a twisted tree canopy with a trail like a maze.
Bits of light break through, radiate your face.
Inhale, the air of water on the leaves leaves a taste.
The trees leave a trace.
The twigs under your feet, crinkle as they break.

Close your eyes, leave behind the past.
Be there, join me in the grass.

I see moss on all the rotted wooden logs.
My feet raw, I walk towards the forest pond.
I see lilies, I see frogs.
No willie nillie clogs.
I really chilly walk.
The slick rocks under my feet as I swish swash.
There is a spring, whispers, it talks.
I listen, blissful in thought.

I lay back in the water.
It helps me float like a father.

I feel my ears pop.
Eyes half open, I still watch.
The sun shining through the tip top.
I see colors coming through the rain.
I hear my heart's tick-tock.

As I stay, lay here and float.
No way I'd row row my boat.

Please don't rock it.
I be bird watching.

They dart from tree to tree.
I wonder, do they notice me?

I go here every week.
I hope I go to sleep.

Breakdown:.

I do not count the time, I do not wear a watch.
I wander to this place, it's awesome to be lost.

X2.

Then I slowly stand.
This is my beach but there is no sand.

The flowers on my path are orange as a sunset.
Some are purple, others red, I haven't seen enough yet.

I do not pick the plants, I watch and let be.
Cause if I picked it then I killed it, and that is deadly.

I hear chirps, I hear songs.
I love birds, I love ponds.
It's the worst when I'm gone.
I work to worship as long.

I got here from a fork in the road.
Here I shed my heavy load:.

To the left was this forest, to the right it was gravel.
And I chose to roam on the road less traveled.
X2.

\+ Join me in the grass.
Leave behind the past.
