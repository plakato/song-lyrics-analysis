Maintaining Lyrics
by The Wreckshop Family.


I see you out there baby, lil' mamas.
On your nine to five, my dogs on the block.

Maintaining, hustling struggling but I gotta survive.
Keep maintaining, it's a burden up on my conscience just staying alive.

Waking up early in the morning, looking in the mirror save my soul.
G-O-D, I feel like screaming till my lungs get so'.
Hustling up in this game, to see some change.
I'm well known already, so I ain't worried bout the fame.
Wanna cop a Range, with a nice homestead.
If you call me on tomorrow, I'll make sure my family fed.
It's hard to survive up in the land, where the real niggas strive.
Not to get hit by a hater, on the blind side.
I try to be the leader of men, but I can't get nobody fed.
When they thinking, that I'm after all the bread.
And niggas steady running they mouth, scared to place a bet on 3.
Not knowing that they dealing, with a full house.

Craig G.
I gotta survive I'm on the strive, on a mission to get it.
This mill ticket clothes rings, full bliss to hit it.
I maintain, hulling my lungs with mary jane.
Gotta keep my composure, you know it's pressure on my brain.
Dealing with stress, this cess steady filling my chest.
Drilling my breath, wondering if I'm killing myself.
I'm on the rise, got my eyes on the prize for real.
Got on my grind pen and pad, spitting bars for scrill.
Because I'm hustling, no more struggling tugs and tuggling.
Mashing for the cream, me and my team click bubbling.

D-Reck.
Did everything to maintain, dealing with the pressure and pain.
They taking life with no gain, but I want the high score mayn.
It's simple and plain, I'm trying to stack mo' change.
And if you ain't feeling that, I ain't trying to know your name.
That go for niggas and dames, drug dealers and lames.
If you all about your scrilla, I know you feeling me mayn.
It's time to do the damn thang, I'm trying to tackle the game.
Like Ray Louis when I pursue it, I'm coming through bringing pain.
Bitch niggas complain, rich niggas grip grain.
On a mash blazing pass your lazy ass, in the fast lane.
Hustling like Larry Flint, hustling for every cent.
If I touch it then it was meant, and that means it was heaven sent.
Cause no money was ever lent, how I spend it is irrelevant.
Trying to take you got me bent, lose your life is the consequence.
The hurry always intense, money dirty till it get rinsed.
When I'm old I might repent, but until then I'm trying win.
