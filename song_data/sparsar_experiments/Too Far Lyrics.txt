Too Far Lyrics
by XCEP.

I want you.
I want you right now.
I never wanted you so bad.
And you know I hide.
And our thing fell apart.
And you know how it feels.
Yeah you know.
Yeah you know.
How it feels.

I wanted nothing but your loving from the start.
Don't know why we had to stress it now we ended up apart.
I guess we have learned the lesson, guess we're taking too far.
Now I know you got the message please stop making it so hard.

I'm too far away.
In this broken-heart game.
I just wanna feel sane.
Again again, again.
I'm so far away.
In this broken-heart game.
I wanna feel sane.
Again, again, again.

It has been going on.
Going on without you.
A lot been going on.
Going on without you.
And I know I gotta.
Keep it going on.
Keep it going on.
I gotta keep it going.
