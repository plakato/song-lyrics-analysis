Dangerous Days Lyrics
by Zola Jesus.


You're gonna win these odd days.
You never stood to fight for your name.
And I will be there unspoken, curious.
You never were the one for us.
You never were the one for us.
And then I'd just lay here open.

On the floor, on the ground.
On the stairs, on the way.
On the floor, on the ground.
On the stairs, on the way.

It's a dark dark day.
And it's dangerous to go.
And listen what they say.
It's a dark dark day.
And it's dangerous to go.
And listen what they say.

In the way, the way you hold yourself straight.
You never were innocent.
And then I just lay here frozen, curious.
You never were the one for us.
You never were the one for us.
And then I'd just lay here open.

On the floor, on the ground.
On the stairs, on the way.
On the floor, on the ground.
On the stairs, on the way.

It's a dark dark day.
And it's dangerous to go.
And listen what they say.
It's a dark dark day.
And it's dangerous to go.
And listen what they say.

It's dangerous.
It's dangerous to know.
When it comes, are you gonna throw.
Your bite into the game.
Know what's right for your name.
Lose your battle, it's all the same.
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous.

It's a dark dark day.
And it's dangerous to go.
And listen what they say.
It's a dark dark day.
And it's dangerous to go.
And listen what they say.

Ooooooooooooh.
Ooooooooooooh.

It's dangerous.
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous to go.
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous.
