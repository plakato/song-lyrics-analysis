Dark Corners Lyrics
by Akala.

Thanks to the revolutionary, great victim.
Was a slave labour.
Grow up with both parents.
The great creator.
Both of them doctors.
Dark corners are the place.
We live on borrowed time.
When he remembered the hand that touched him finally understood what it means.
The was an innovator.
His brains forget to tell the lungs that they needed to breathe.
As the needles plunge into the vein.
No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that's right.
Had a off leverage with the media only painted him as gold.
But he was clever.
They had plans to start a family.
Dark corners.
They were slightly annoyed.
And of course, there was that was that we're fighting.


Off the evil, on the struggle.
With a wedding in June.
Everest school she was top of the class.
Energy ain't created or destroyed if this changes form.
He had struggling with a sickness ever since 14.
His whole body went into shock.
Of what he accomplished.
Dark corners.
Finally got clean.
Everything you yapping for been, cut never raw, like all users.
But they never got the chance in the end.
Should have seen him with a craze.
For those underground.
He couldn't find comfort for his soul.
Once we play the songs.
But how well did he play with the cards that were dealt.
Can't see.
Fighted the cold sweat.
Didn't know what in her mind.
She was in it.
When we running our alarms.
The scientist to offer the report disappeared.

So when they found that he was english.
Even his father was slightly jealous.
Some characterize it as the judgement of the sinners.
All that come back is scrutiny.
Studying law.
In which powerful grows.
Michelle left the house in the storm.
To keep, the man that was throwing from the acapella public.
Going to wealth.
That something they did prosper.

Power changes reality.
Ye they demanded better.
Her parents had decided that they would apologise.
It was two people.
Brave much higher.
When we hit them dark corners.

Church every sunday.
Became an icon.
Message is clear, as power is old.
When they throw back those release.
He didn't know he was so conventional.
Find them accident.
Her parents wanted for her a nice young looking boy.
Parents from Nigeria.
My blood was exchange.
And it was the only time my life, my mind felt so clear.
The dark corners are the place.
When them dark corners come.
But ye it was true.
On his deathbed.
Afghan something was strange.
When dark corners come.
And they say there is no difference.
They use to make the pain disappear.
Dark corners.
But it always gets away.
Death always catches up.
All he could see is images of death reaching him.
Triple the family coffins.
Now he's in the dark corners.

Colours changed.
Though, the ain't never be rich.
She never saw the truck before it ended her life.
Say they wouldn't come to the wedding.
It was a rainy night.
That made it worth pursuing his dreams.
She ain't never missed a week.
Where we look death in the faces.
And though this annoyed her.
No, cannot run.
Each time it was released.
But had strange dreams of justice and helping the poor.
Nice house in the states.
Always spiritualizing.
But dark corners.
Ran straight back to the same block where he use to cop it.
And this CEO.
No, cannot run.
And met a girl.
And we let it give us chase.
It's blood.
No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that's right.
And we cannot back it up.
And fell asleep.
This time the substance, the injected was pure.
In his life with himself.
Maybe that's part of why she chose him.
Products that can't resembles his age.
Calling all money ye.
When he hit straight fire.
His old connect came up in the road, new supplier.
A good girl, a normal girl that was everybody's view.
But when they found out he was addicted to drugs.
It was totally shameful.
But beneath all the shine and the sheen.
I'm a kind of nigga who is troubled inside.
She couldn't denied it, it was true.
Dark corners.

Now wish to show you.
Whatever I was self, a wordy a definition.
So when the news came about Michelle, he just lost it.
Drug addicted politician.
The sound just travels on.
Viictims of mercenaries that this government betrayed.
Billions couldn't find him another day, another pain.
But despite all the wealth and the things that he owned.
Whatever convention it was.
