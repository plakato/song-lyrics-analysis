The Struggle (Intro) Lyrics
by QG.


Whats up man, 
I wan na welcome y'all to live life. Man 

Imma share my struggle with y'all, my stories
Downfalls up-falls up-rises. Whatever you may call it
Im just tryna see better than what i done seen and do better than what i done. 
Done..
Im just tryna live live my life right man
But. Tonight it ain't right, man
How many times have you tried and had to give up cause it felt like you wasn't
gone. Do it do good enough or well enough 
If thats the case man
Im just tryna live man remind myself where i wan na be
I can't forget where I've come from at all

The struggle kicked my ass
Knocked me on down
Damn, where we gone go now, 
Man how we gone cope Now, 
Damn better get with the program
Cause, no man or no m'am
Gone take care of them. Babies
Now. We think about the future
And. We stack up for the maybe's
Now, can't we think about the past
Reminiscing on good times
And, not thinking about the bad
That, we had

Live your life..
