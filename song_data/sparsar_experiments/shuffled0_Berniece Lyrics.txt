Berniece Lyrics
by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Remember where we came from we can do it all again.
Better think twice it's three against one.
Get a real job let the guitar go.
Berneice, sweet Berneice.

She's taken me to places that I've never been.
There ain't no future in this rock-n-roll.
So thanks to all you people, give youselves a hand.

A guitar woman needs a guitar man.

Did my first gig in a rock-n-roll band.
The first time that I picked her up little did I know.

So go for your guitars, go for your guns.
I can still remember I was eight years old.
One without the other, neither one of them can stand.

Take your best shot it's a showdown now.
