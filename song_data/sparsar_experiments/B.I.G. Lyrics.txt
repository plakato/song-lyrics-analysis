B.I.G. Lyrics
by X Ambassadors.


I been working night and day.
I'm going berserk and I'm going insane.
But I say hey, it's a new day.
Hey, I'm on my way.
I wouldn't stay, but if you made me.
Bring on the next phase.

I'm gonna go big.
I feel bigger than ever before.
I'm gonna go big.
Yeah, I'm going bigger than I was before.
And you can tell your friends and all their friends.
I want the whole wide world to know.
I'm gonna go big.
B.I.G., bigger than I was before.

So come on, watch me.
Stay up late.
Come on, everybody.
We got to congregate.
We say hey, it's a new day.
Hey, I'm on my way.
I wouldn't stay, but if you made me.
Bring on the next phase.

I'm gonna go big.
I feel bigger than ever before.
I'm gonna go big.
Yeah, I'm going bigger than I was before.
And you can tell your friends and all their friends.
I want the whole wide world to know.
I'm gonna go big.
B.I.G., bigger than I was before.

I'm gonna go big.
I feel bigger than ever before.
I'm gonna go big.
Yeah, I'm going bigger than I was before.
And you can tell your friends and all their friends.
I want the whole wide world to know.
I'm gonna go big.
B.I.G., bigger than I was before.

I'm gonna go big.
I feel bigger than ever before.
I'm gonna go big.
Yeah, I'm going bigger than I was before.
And you can tell your friends and all their friends.
I want the whole wide world to know.
I'm gonna go big.
B.I.G., bigger than I was before.
