Steady Stayin' Paid #2 Lyrics
by 51.50.

Feindin' like a bitch, To stay in the game.
Hustlin' n strain, I was up.
But now I'm long came.

I was flippin', lost my sack.
Now I'm tryin' to get back.
I can't resort to the jack.
Because I'm known for that.
But I'm a gangsta.
An ace at all tricks of the trades.
Since I was young.

So I ....
And come up with a master plan.
Oh yeah I know I'll rob the house across my.
Hell muthafuckin' yeah, That's a cool come up.
There's hella weed and money.
Plus the people is old as fuck.

I seen that old muthafucka take his ass to work about 10.
That's when my pimp ass gangsta plan.
Had to kick in.
So I approach with slow speed and hella keyed.

Kicked in the door with no time to be wasted.
The first thing I seen was the old bitch ....
Put the pistol to her head and she pointed to the next room.
Opened the door.
I seen hella money and loot.

Shot the bitch in the face.
Then I ran straight to the back.
I throw in a fist with the muthafuckin' money sack.
Jumped in the Lac.
Put the peddle straight to the floor.
Two beeps on the horn.

Now I'm outtie, ho.
