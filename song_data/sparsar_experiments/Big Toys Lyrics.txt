Big Toys Lyrics
by 504 Boys.


What what what what what.

Who talkin noise?
We makin noise.
504 boy.
Playin with them big toys.

Look.
Motherfuckers its mac.
The one who pump slugs in your back.
Lyrical attacka.
Keep it ghetto like black lacqua.
Camo'd assasin.
To the best  the epitomy.
Of a soulja.
Bustin like I got chips up on my shoulda.
Hold your horses.
I come through like whatchu wanna do?
Murder who?
I kill that whole crew with a 2-2.
These niggas rookie.
I crush em like pink cookies.
Dont fuck with me.
When im broke.
Pissed off.
And my bitch ain't given me no nookie.
Kinda glad P took me.
Off the streets to make duckies.
Now I take supermodels to hotels.
And make whoopie.
Pull they hair.
Call em out they names.
Dont you like that?
Then I give my lil sister the cash.
So she strike that.
Niggas like mac.
Rock mercedez benz toe bustas.
And I only shop at them military.
Stores cousin.
Solja rag on my eyes till I die.
Nigga what?
Im a Tank Dogg.
These niggas is just mutts.

My nigga Jeff just got 30 years.
Fuck MC.
Went in a house.
Found a safe with about 3 bricks.
Thats that punk bitch Deuce-A.
Sweatin my niggas.
He won't rest until my whole click's.
Doin some figgaz.
Can we ride on my enemy's late tonite?
A young nigga.
With a .45.
Bustin on site.
What I might.
Is whether  bleed with passion.
See this drug game to me.
Is like a fatal attraction.
Salvation from this life.
Thats what I need.
See these jealous ass niggas.
Won't let me breathe.
Will I succeed in this cold world?
Pray for me please.
I dont get caught up in this rap life.
A dying disease.
Over seas is where they come from.
We know who sent them.
If them bitches six-teenth.
I believe ill get them.
I ain't fuckin with no new niggas.
Believe im ballin.
If I ever go to jail.
Big Boz im callin.
Will my real niggas ride for me?
Believe they will.
If I get killed.
Bring me back to the IvoryVille.
Nigga.

They say only god can judge me.
My peepz say yeah there be world war 3.
Prolly in the year 2 G.
But livin this street life.
Im thuggin and ready to rumble.
With any nigga that ready to tussle.
Motherfucker.
I feel as if im at the edge of my life.
So I give it to them raw.
In the heat of the night.
I ain't hard to find.
Im the nigga with the two 9's.
Next to the Last Don.
Nigga thugged out for mine.
A Made Man.
The Bossalinie of the scenery.
And be full of that greenery.
When you peepin me.
Im full of that crime family.
Im on the grind and I can handle that.
I ain't trappin.
I gotta weigh that shake.
Ima hit them with these ghetto ingredients.
Some ghetto dope.
Go round tweekin.
And get D.I.G.
Thats me im a young nigga.
Fuck around with me dog.
And y'all get done nigga.
