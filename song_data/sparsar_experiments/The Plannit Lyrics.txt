The Plannit Lyrics
by 3 Melancholy Gypsies.

The planet.
I handle it.
Infinitive.
Climate.
Inventive.

Rest my legs off.
Worlds my easel.

Gods my mind state.
Arts my climate.

X2.
Left, right.
Stay on track.
Push on, forward march.
Don't fall back.
Keep moving.

My brigade won't be swayed or made to be afraid.
Head high hearts humble righteous men don't parade.
Stood silence in the shadows.
Steady building up my rage.
And it's too late to counter once the move has been made.
Like Aragorn call them ghosts off the ship.
We gon' slide through your city start tearing up shit.
Destroying ring wraiths that bring fake hymns.
Singing praises to these demons named Cash and Gems.
We smash such pens.
And flash grim grins.
As we administer a sinister fate to men.
Who have a transgressed and refused to transcend.
The confines of the state of mind they in.
The path has been laid the gauntlet thrown down.
The power so potent when I'm playin' with pronouns.
It's like a healing potion when the poetry's put down.
Elixir.
That's a mixture with the word.
And this verb combined in my mind.
Until it's stirred.
Brain left scrambled so they label me disturbed.
Tray in your face, get it straight we don't get served.
Orel MURSheiser on the mound with a sick curve.
Thoughts thrown swift so your vision might get blurred.
Get nerve.
Get gone.
Or go home.
I'm headed for the rim gonna claim a gold throne.
So hold on.
Or come along if you feel this.
But on this journey we'll encounter some realness.
There's drama there's pain.
There's death there's illness.
But 3M Generals will lead individuals to a positive called change.
Give you confidence in the rain.
Bring your tolerance to the pain.
I'm polish this insane.
So when you play this song and recite this rhyme.
You open up your heart and you soul starts to shine.
For the journey is the struggle but the movement is divine.

X8.
Left, right.
Stay on track.
Push on, forward march.
Don't fall back.
Keep moving.

Rest my legs off.
Worlds my easel.

Gods my mind state.
Arts my climate.
