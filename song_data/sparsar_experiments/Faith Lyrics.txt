Faith Lyrics
by Vivian Green.

I guess I blamed myself.
For our beautiful disaster.
But when you're young.
You do some stupid things.

Not that you're innocent in all this.
Because you truly broke my heart.
I was so out of control.
But you turned your back.
And kept your eyes closed.

And so, here we are.
It would be the ultimate forgiveness.
If we could put it all behind.
Oh, I don't wanna get my hopes up high.

I gotta have a little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.
I gotta have a little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.
I gotta have a little.

Said baby, if we did this.
It'd be the ultimate forgiveness.
A little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.

I can still see the look on your face.
As I turned and walked away.
It's a image that I wish I could erase.
The moment in time that means everything.

And I wish that I could take it back.
Wish that I could change it.
Ain't nobody ever had.
My heart that can replace you.
So, I'm hoping my wish will be granted.
I'll be the mother of second chances.

And so, here we are.
It would be the ultimate forgiveness.
If we could put it all behind.
Oh, I don't wanna get my hopes up high.

I gotta have a little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.
I gotta have a little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.
I gotta have a little.

And baby, if we did this.
It'd be the ultimate forgiveness.
A little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.

Turn back the hand of time.
Make every wrong right.
Forgive what we don't understand.
Just look ahead and try again.

We were just too young, we messed it up.
And there will never be another.
And if I held you in my arms.
I swear I wouldn't let go.

Gotta have a little, have a little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.
I gotta have a little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.

Baby, if we did this.
It'd be the ultimate forgiveness.
A little faith.
Just a little, just a little, just a little.

I guess I blamed myself.
For our beautiful disaster.
Just a little, just a little.
If I had just a little faith.
