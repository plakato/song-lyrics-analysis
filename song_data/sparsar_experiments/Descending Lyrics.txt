Descending Lyrics
by Rusty.

In Hab town blows me away.
I never thought that I'd ever see your face.
It was strange and kinda good.
Being back in your neighbourhood.
If there's problems I will solve them.
Please don't run away.
If there is a problem you can hide today.
We talk awhile I'm feeling loose.
Should have stopped, but the beer is flowing good.
You were here and now your gone.
Think of you when the miles role along.
If there's a problem I will solve them.
Please don't run away.
If there's a problem you can hide today.
