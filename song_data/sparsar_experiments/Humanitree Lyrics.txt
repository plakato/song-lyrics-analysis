Humanitree Lyrics
by Visionaries.


There's a little bit in you.
There's a little bit in me.
There's so many branches on the humanitree.

First name, double, last name, standard.
Fits appropriately, due to the pattern.
Of how you'd want to be treated.
Can't open the door when already seated.
Never talks first, waits to be greeted.
Won't compete if there's chance to be defeated.
They'll complement to get complemented.
From the tone of their voice you can tell if they meant it.
Expect so much, accept so little.
Heated discussions that never meet in the middle.
One sided coin toss, what's the result.
Yeah, you made the mistake but it wasn't your fault.
Live for your word, die for your lie.
Give false respect to big up your pride.
Says one thing then action contradicts.
Sends negative waves but can't stand conflict.
A mind molester isn't a registered crook.
All you gotta do is take a deeper look.

First name, hard, last name, headed.
Don't want to listen, actions are regretted.
Saw the accident had no time to change.
Saw no one else to blame sweating tears in the rain.
Always getting mad when given advice.
For every mistake you made the same mistake twice.
Wonder what you did to what you didn't do.
Who didn't go to school, late bloomer now you knew.
And I know not, what attracts you to be hard cocked.
Self jocked, stuck in a living paradox.
Your parallel thoughts always doublecross mine.
Hope someday you find your mind.
Meantime, arrest self for a non-listening crime.
Numbskulls realize all in due time, time, time.

First name, hot, last name, temper.
Friction over the edge, now there's no turning back.
Enter the red zone like Fred stone.
Flint sparks the price to claim everyone else but self.
Set tone to elevate and yell.
Scream, then harsh words to demean.
Those cared enough and got fed enough and found it time to come clean.
The scene takes a turn for the worst when blood vessels burst.
Can't stand the pangs of criticism, the truth hurts.
Defense mechanism surface, nothing is safe.
Shattered glass, holes in plastic prove the need to escape.
Hair standing on end, as fury intensifies.
As the adrenalin possession is brooding the dark side.
On the verge of blacking out, the minute is now collosal.
Dosal fluids transform to raging waters full throttle.
