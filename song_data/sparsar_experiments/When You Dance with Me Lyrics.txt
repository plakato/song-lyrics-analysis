When You Dance with Me Lyrics
by Rushlow.

There's an ocean of stars and a sea of moonlight.
Rainin' down on us tonight.
And the wind through the willows is singin' that song.
I wanna keep my arms around you all night long just holdin' on.

Caught up in the motion of your every move.
So lost in the moment, spinning, falling into you.
I'm everywhere I wanna be, girl your love is all I see.
When you dance with me.

There's a magical moment when you take my hand.
A chemistry I don't understand.
The way our bodies start movin' in time.
The way you move me blows my mind, you blow my mind.

Caught up in the motion of your every move.
So lost in the moment, spinning, falling into you.
I'm everywhere I wanna be, girl your love is all I see.
When you dance with me.
Dance with me.

How could I be so lucky.
To have you dancin' with me?

Caught up in the motion of your every move.
So lost in the moment, spinning, falling into you.
I'm everywhere I wanna be, girl your love is all I see.
When you dance with me.
Dance with me.

When you dance. when you dance with me.
When you dance, your love is all I need.
When you dance, when you dance with me.
When you dance, your love is all I see.
