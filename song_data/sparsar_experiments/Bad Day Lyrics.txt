Bad Day Lyrics
by Bizarre.

Bizarre This is a bad day: 
 
Motherfucker. You need to get up and find yo' ass, a job 
I'm sick of you just laying around all day long playin, Nintendos 
They, don't even make Nintendos no more 
Where the hell. You find that shit at 
And. I KNOW that you can find a job yo' bus pass is in yo' wallet 
I seen that shit yesterday, you just
sit up all day. 
Lie lie: lie, eat, eat, eat, drink, drink, drink, 
You, don't do SHIT, I'm SICK OF YOU, 

Bizarre 
Yeah, just wakin up in the mornin got ta. Thank God. 
Got my ass cheeks stuck to a fishing rod. 
Where'S, the dogs, ain't, no frogs 
Momma cookin breakfast with no logs 
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out, 
No Thanksgiving, so we eatin carry out 
This dude came through my front do'. 
He said I wouldn't live to see a twenty-fo' 
I got ta go cause. I got on flip-flops 
If I slow down, then my feet'll drop 
Had to stop at the red light. 
Everybody laughin at my yellow dirt bike, 
And everything's. All right 
I got a beep from Sherri she's, a transvestite 
Called up my homies and I'm askin y'all 
Bring. Twenty bottles of alcohol, 
Playin football and I'm trouble 
They gave me the ball. I fumbled 
And. I can't believe my best friend's gay 
Today was a bad day. 
 
Yeah today was fucked up. 
Ay man get a scene for these niggas 
Today was a bad day. 
Let'Em know how fucked it was 
Goddamn today was fucked up: 
 
Bizarre 
I bust, my ass in the shower 
Got on this fresh new baby powder 
Just. Yesterday these fools tried to blast me 
Saw the police and got my ass, beat 
No flexin whooped, my ass. In the intersection 
Should, I shoot that's the question 
Went to Big Fam house. They watchin Rap City, 
Shootin them craps. I got fifty 
Shake'em up shake'em up shake'em up shake'em 
A circle of niggas watch me all fake'em 
They beat my ass. I need nine nine-eleven 
They threw my ass through the back do'. 
And took all my cash flow 
Punched me in the chest and kicked me in the asshole 
I just found out my best friend's gay 
Today was a bad day. 
 
Interlude 
Today was all fucked up. Rainin and shit 
Ay 
Today was a bad day sing that shit 
Hahahaha 
Yeah 
Sing that shit nigga today was fucked up. 
 
Bizarre 
Left, my homey's house paid 
Picked up this chick been tryin to rape. Since the 12th grade 
It's ironic, the pistons is the man 
And Artest fired on a fan, damn 
Took a trip to Miami 
Got. My ass beat at the 21st Grammy's 
My dick is so weak, so weak, 
So weak. I put my own ass to sleep 
Woke. Her up around one 
And didn't hesitate to say that she didn't cum 
Ridin down 7 Mile coastin 
Smokin on the potion rubbin on some baby oil lotion, 
And nothin seems to work out. 
She smacked me in the face and murked out. 
Today was like one of those bad dreams: 
Jackin off with a bowl full of whipped cream 
Helicopter. Looking for the murder 
Two in the mornin got the Coney Island, burger 
Even, where the lights of the Goodyear Blimp 
And. It read Bizarre ain't, shit 
Drunk as hell and I'm throwin up 
Pager cut off. So you know it. Ain'T blowin up 
I, found out that my best friend was gay. 
Today was a bad day. 
 
It's been a fucked up afternoon, 
Been a fucked up weekend, ay 
Sing that shit nigga 
Today was a bad day 
Sing. What that bitch be singin 
Just like Ice Cube, be singin sing just like that 
Hahahaha 
The, Hannicap Circus y'all today was fucked up 
Comin soon. Bizarre Hannicap Circus 
Today was a bad day. Motherfucker 
Fuck y'all ...
