Bad Day Lyrics
by Wretch 32.


Cell double 2, Wretch 32.
Weapon X.
Its the worst day of or lives.

Like I'm Wretch 32, my phones ringing.
Hello, yo, what?, where?, how?swear down?
What?,where?,are you sure?swear down?
You're there now?Don't lie, don't cry, i'll try.Bye.
Cell they raided my mums yard.
They ran up in there with straps.
They're saying its a gun charge.
I'm pissed but I'm praying its a dumb sarge.
Or they find the gun parked in the mud.
In the front yard.
And my whites underneath it.
My browns right beside it.
My wife tried to hide it.
When OD supplied it.
And if the sniffer bitch gets a sniff of bricks.
Then I know that they'll find it.
And I still can't rest assured.
Cos if they check the second drawer.
In the Chest of Drawers,they're bound to find.
They best of a draw.
And when my mum and gyals is to together.
They're always on a hype so.
I know that they'll test the law.
Wait, hold on I got a text.
They cuffed my mum and gyal.
And my little sisters next?
That ain't fair, wait hold on.
That will only happen if they think its theirs.
Man I've never had a day like this.
I hope the rest of the hours don't stay like this.
Whats the date? The 28th I should've been a court.
And wasn't allowed to top it all off, I gotta worry.

Like I stepped on three drains.
Whilst under a ladder.
I saw a black cat, broke a mirror.
Walking through a pole.
Saw a magpie fly just above my reach.
And all of this happened on Friday the 13th.

Like I stepped on three drains.
Whilst under a ladder.
I saw a black cat, broke a mirror.
Walking through a pole.
Saw a magpie fly just above my reach.
And all of this happened on Friday the 13th.

I'm having a bad day, feeling a bad way.
I want that dirty money so.
My bread get buttered sideways.
Things are going wrong.
I don't know whats going on.
My lucks bad I'll cut and stab.
If I don't get my dough its on.
I tell them my lucks bad they just ignore me.
Until I start, I start walking like Jason Voorhees.
I got a sick brain its double.
So I stepped on six drains with 22 black cats.
Whos insane? Its bray I'll go mega on you darg.
Come to your crib, and buss an umbrella in your yard.
I dare you to try a ting.
If you don't like me.
You'll look like an arsenal fan.
When I'm done with your white Tee.
If I'm having bad luck, someone gets.
Gabbed up,Tied up, Pied up blindfold.
Eyes closed, grabbed up, stabbed up.
Guess its just the bad luck.
I lost out on 22 grams when I bagged up.
I want that dirty money.
Thats all thats on my mindstate.
I'll be damned, I'm not Usher.
But I want it my way.
They skies are grey, a bad day.
I stabbed the bray for Chrissakes.
Take his girl, I left him as a statistic in the crime rates.
These nuckers keep on watching me.
They're looking at my watch for greed.
They want my bling and in my girl they.
Wanna drop a seed,nah thats not happening.
Thats the perfect bad day.
Man will be left in the hospital.
Hurting in a bad way.

Like I stepped on three drains.
Whilst under a ladder.
I saw a black cat, broke a mirror.
Walking through a pole.
Saw a magpie fly just above my reach.
And all of this happened on Friday the 13th.

Like I stepped on three drains.
Whilst under a ladder.
I saw a black cat, broke a mirror.
Walking through a pole.
Saw a magpie fly just above my reach.
And all of this happened on Friday the 13th.
