Nowhere to Hide Lyrics
by The Virus.

I spend all my money.
Just to survive.
But it's hard to keep up.
Because cost is on the rise.

It's hard to keep up, hard to survive.
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide.

The more that I make.
The more they take away.
The more things I need.
The more I have to pay.

It's hard to keep up, hard to survive.
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide.

They say success - I say depressed.
I keep getting paid - yet always running on empty.
The more that I try - The more that I die.
In my fu*king world - I'll never be free.

It's hard to keep up, hard to survive.
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to Hide.
