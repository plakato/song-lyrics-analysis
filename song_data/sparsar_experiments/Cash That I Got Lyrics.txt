Cash That I Got Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


What my motherfucking name 
Mike Jones, Mike Jones, Mike Jones 
My, album, Who Is Mike Jones coming soon, yeah 
Here come who Mike Jones 
 
Mike Jones 
Hitting the block with rocks in socks. Let down my top when the sun is hot, 
Ice dripping from grill and watch some complain. Cause Mike is hot 
I'm hopping out, so they baller block pimping hoes in the parking lot 
Flip in thongs, with no halter top 
They say Mike Jones. Without the Who I blew up fast, I thought you knew 
Down South. We bang Screw when I'm done with it, it'll be a Peru 
When. I flow you can't deny I'm cold as fuck and I'm all so fly 
Hoes bop when I pass by cause. They know. I'M a fly guy 
Show, my grill and you stuck still she a han'capping, I'm a fuck, still 
Hop in the Lincoln for buck fills screens fall down. Saying. What'S the deal, 
Coming soon is Runnin The Game. So y'all can see how I'm running the game 
I hit. The streets fans run up to me and tell me that that I'm running thangs 
Mike Jones Slim Thug Lil Keke. We be 
Valeting in V.I.P., sipping Henessy, with a dime piece 
On my side when I ride I'm on 24's, like T.I 
Definition of Mike Jones and the Swishahouse we fly 
I talk the talk and walk the walk, princess cuts in my platinum mouth 
When, Who is Mike Jones, come I'ma, put a mill in the vault 
I talk the talk and walk the walk, princess cuts in my platinum mouth 
When, Who is Mike Jones, come I'ma, put a mill in the vault 
 
 Mike Jones.
