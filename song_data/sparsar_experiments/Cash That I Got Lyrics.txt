Cash That I Got Lyrics
by Swishahouse.


What my motherfucking name.
Mike Jones , Mike Jones , Mike Jones.
My album Who Is Mike Jones coming soon, yeah.
Here come who, Mike Jones.

Mike Jones.
Hitting the block with rocks in socks, let down my top when the sun is hot.
Ice dripping from grill and watch, some complain cause Mike is hot.
I'm hopping out so they baller block, pimping hoes in the parking lot.
Flip in thongs, with no halter top.
They say Mike Jones without the Who, I blew up fast I thought you knew.
Down South we bang Screw, when I'm done with it it'll be a Peru.
When I flow you can't deny, I'm cold as fuck and I'm all so fly.
Hoes bop when I pass by, cause they know I'm a fly guy.
Show my grill and you stuck still, she a han'capping I'm a fuck still.
Hop in the Lincoln for buck fills, screens fall down saying what's the deal.
Coming soon is Runnin The Game, so y'all can see how I'm running the game.
I hit the streets fans run up to me, and tell me that that I'm running thangs.
Mike Jones, Slim Thug, Lil Keke we be.
Valeting in V.I.P., sipping Henessy with a dime piece.
On my side when I ride, I'm on 24's like T.I.
Definition of Mike Jones and the Swishahouse, we fly.
I talk the talk and walk the walk, princess cuts in my platinum mouth.
When Who is Mike Jones come, I'ma put a mill in the vault.
I talk the talk and walk the walk princess cuts in my platinum mouth.
When Who is Mike Jones come, I'ma put a mill in the vault.

Mike Jones &amp;  - 2x.
Cash flow I flip alot, freak hoes I pimp alot.
Playa haters, I ain't tripping about.
Cause they ain't got the cash, that I got.

Lil' Keke.
Who is Mike Jones, who is Lil' Ke.
Ain't no motherfucking where, that you niggas know me.
An underground legend, making plenty of wealth.
S.U.C. to the finish, it's the Don himself.
Yeah I'm platinum bound, with this platinum sound.
Hit the strip on a Sunday, let the top lay down.
Spit this gangsta shit, and they love it for real.
I sold five hundred thousand, no major deal.
That's the truth, nigga.
Pull the sound scan, I swear that's the proof nigga.
Side ways, got my deuce out the roof nigga.
And they loving it G.
Certified go-getter, out the 7-1-3.
I'm a O.G , and I pay what it cost.
Me and Slim Thug the Boss, at the Swishahouse.
I'm bouncing on 24's, rolling on big thangs.
Hitting the highway, and I'm still changing lanes.

Slim Thug.
It's Slim Thugger motherfucker, the big Boss of the North.
That been Boss, since I was spitting hits with the House.
And I'm sitting on too much mail, to put it for sale.
You want my spot oh well, come follow my trail.
A trendsetter been having cheddar since uh, forever.
shit, prolly never.
I'd rather spit these hit flows, and get rich off those.
a underground rapper, with his own clothes.
I done shows, every week straight since 9-8.
Off these other cats tracks, now who else done done dat.
And still turned down deals, worth more than a mill.
and I'm still, worth more than a mill for real.
I got my money right, Slim set for life.
So next time you think you the nicest, think twice.
Take my advice , before you contest.
Cause when you messing with these three, you fucking with the best nigga.
