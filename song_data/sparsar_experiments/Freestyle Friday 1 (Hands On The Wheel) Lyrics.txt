Freestyle Friday 1 (Hands On The Wheel) Lyrics
by Yung MillzZ.


Its Friday 
So, What Better To Do Than Freestyle 
 
I Switch Focus To Make Change 
U Make Change To Ditch The Focus 
So I take ya girl get the brains 
And make her G String, hocus, pocus, 
Taking notice, y'all take some notes, 
Cuz my shit, so potent. I could reach the pope 
And when you thinkin over my past tense 
My. Future thoughts is seeing Oprah Otis 
My 4s vicious wait. Til a nigga drop a 16 
When. I was 16. I coulda killed the fishes 
They just lucky that my shit wasn't in stream. 
I got swagg all down my inseam, so hands gon na stay stuck to it, 
Put a track out. I call it target practice 
So I might as well go and put a buck to it. 
Put a dolla on this one gave the next one a rack 
Know. I had to get on this and drop a couple. Stax 
The Bank, don't close. The flo is in motion: 
The, lower end potions, 
The realest, realization, I'm floatin over the ocean, 
The worlds. So little I'm so big 
Who, the fuck gon na say I can't run this bitch 
President Milla you niggas cannot touch that 
Me, not killin the game you're, seeing everything, but that 
You boys comin after me, 
Bout to show em how kamakaze bust at ya noggin properly 
While, I figure the anomaly niggas tryin to stop me: 
I'mma, throw a trey for the spartan squad. 
You hatin niggas get the first digit 
I start goin right after hard 
That. Why you virgins can't fuck wit it 
What I do with bars, is like what VC did to rims 
I'm a challenge to be conquered. You just Cinnamon 
AKA Scary Spice, you Mel B, while I'm on B I'll, say free Max 
He'll prolly be out before you see my LP 
But, either way: I'mma succeed while you niggas suck seed 
And, everything goes down, but 3s 
6s up cups up PHA blunts up 
I'Ll turf, a jerk give the hearst some work. 

All love to taylor gang. I raised the flame since Dana Dane 
And. I bring the same on my daily 8s, but y'all just got 28 off the brain 
300.
