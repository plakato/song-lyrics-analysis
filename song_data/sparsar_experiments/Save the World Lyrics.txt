Save the World Lyrics
by Swedish House Mafia.


Into the streets.
We're coming down.
We never sleep.
Never get tired.
Through urban fields.
And suburban lights.

Turn the crowd up now.
We'll never back down.
Shoot down the skyline.
Watch it on primetime.
Turn up the love now.
Listen up now, turn up the love.

Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I.
We're gonna save the world tonight.

It's far from home.
It's for the better.
What we dream, it's all that matters.
We're on our way, united.

Turn the crowd up now.
We'll never back down.
Shoot down the skyline.
Watch it on primetime.
Turn up the love now.
Listen up now, turn up the love.

Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I.
We're gonna save the world tonight.

Who's gonna save.
Who's gonna bring.
We're gonna make it, you and I.
Who's gonna save.
Who's gonna bring.
We're gonna save the world tonight.
