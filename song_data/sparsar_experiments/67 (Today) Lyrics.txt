67 (Today) Lyrics
by 67.


Niggas saying 67k I don't know you.
Move out my way.
67 ain't a gang, it's a family.
Rudeboy mind what you say.
If it weren't for the cameras.
Couple man would be dead up today.
25 in the Mac, 2 in the dotty, 6 in the trey.

Suttin garn dead up today.
Believe me the mackah will spray.
A thousand grams in the box.
That's the food that I bagged up today.
Bitch tryna give me top, I don't know you.
Move get the fuck out my face.
No face no case, su-suttin garn dead up.
today.

Smoke man normal, 44 corn that's.
awful.
The wise man said 'you'll be rich one day'.
So I trap hard normal.
Skeng in a 4 door truck.
Fuck the pigs we unlawful.
Outta town couple packs were moving informal.
Ten toes on the opp block.
Lurk with the big M and the dot dots.
Woosh, woosh.
Sweep a nigga up if he fucks with the opp blocks.
A bitch can get it too.
That's the meaning of an opp thot.
Trap so hard, I ain't even checked my stopwatch.
Money is the mo, so I get dough.
Interrupt get steamed like a hot pot.
Loud buds in the room.
Spark up the joint, that's opp pot.
Browning down low.
All that bitch do is top top.
Niggas though they were hard.
When they rode out with that dead pop.

Suttin soon drop, got 25 bells for an opp.
I remember that day so clear when we came through and suttin got shot.
Make a whole load of gwop, anytime bro throws me a box.
In a 4 door truck with the dot.
See jakes then I swerve and I'm off.
I've been outside getting money in.
Any crop that was there, I was running in.
M used to get mad.
Like 'fuck this LD we're bunning him'.
Look when I got my man.
Not one of his bredrins was jumping in.
Look, we fry man.
Like roll on your block and start dumping things.
These niggas don't know man.
I'll finesse me a box from the cro man.
Finesse me some bread from the dough man.
Might roll up with M and just smoke man.
Look at these yutes.
Flexing in vids when they're broke as a joke and they owe man.
Early morn at the door like the postman.
Might just blow me a face with the coke can.
