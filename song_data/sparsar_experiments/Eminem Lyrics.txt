Eminem Lyrics
by Sway & King Tech.


Talking.

Eminem.
Yo, I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated.
Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it.
You need to be immediately treated.
While you breathin' you'll be leavin'.
The receiving room this evening with Jesus.
You hate on us, we'll be waitin' on eight corners.
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders.
I'll hop in the Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you.
And bombard you in the car that ya mom bought you.
Mess around and get choked and found in a moat.
Floatin' around drowned face down in a boat.
I'll pile five dudes in a pen.
And we'll pull up to the seven mile drive-thru.
At McDonald's and pile-drive you.
I got the power to snatch a driver out his Eddie Bauer.
When it rides by me at ninety miler per hour.
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white-out.
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows.
It's like that, it's like that.
