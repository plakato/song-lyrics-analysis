Donut Lyrics
by Tyler Gary.


Yo i been around the block.
Now I'm where i started.
If i took a couple notes.
They'd read the world is so retarded.
Niggas think they hot and sautered.
Just cause they impress they mamas.
Eat a dick without a napkin.
Give a fuck what you had ordered.
Name is Tyler, I'm important.
Reporting for duty sporting.
A bomb on my shoes and shorts.
Could give a fuck about some jordans.
Grab a glass and get to pouring.
We'll drink until we hear snoring.
Wake up next to....
Fuck it i'll call her gorgeous.
Make her leave and start recording.
Some shit the world will adore.
More then the look on hitlers face.
When he knew he had lost the war.
This is hip hop in its purest form.
Fuck the world, don't conform.
Mindless zombies everywhere.
Inside the country i was born.
USA, California, San Jose, Thats the northern.
Section of my state of mind.
If you push play do not rewind.
And turn this dial clockwise.
My second job's to cock wives.
Her visions fine, i missed her mouth.
Thats why i call her cock eyed.
Bask in the ambiance.
You couldn't sleep on me with the help of 100 ambiens.
Couldn't put me to sleep with the punch of an ape thats tantrumin....
Right in front of you i bet she'll call me handsome man.

Truth....

Truth....

Truth....

True.
