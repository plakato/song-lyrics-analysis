The Gas Face (Remix) Lyrics
by 3rd Bass.

MC Serch.
Aiyyo Prince Paul, is this a Gas Face lyrical remix?

Prince Paul.
Yes indeed Serch.
And it goes a little umm-ah, somethin like this...

Gas, past tense, made facially.
3rd Bass'll express, KMD.
Three blind mice on sight.
Zev Lover, gave it the first light.
So I revise on remix.
Swing super unleaded on my gas dick.
Kicks em in the grill, for non-believers.
I leave em speechless, backstab deceivers.
Sub Roc cut Serch with the clipper.
I change oil, I unzip my zipper.
A riff of Aretha, a face of saliva.
Don't gas the 3rd, the 3rd is liver.
And try your luck, but your ass got waxed.
So all negative vibes got axed.
I beg to differ, I cleanse my system.
Another victim, the Gas Face I give em.

Oh shit.. oh shit.. oh shit.. oh shit...

Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black.
Musta been a white guy who started all that.
For those souped up supremicsts.
Can't forget about the cocaine chemist.
That made crack a household name.
Silence for Yusef Hawkins being slain.
Lamebrains, who can't accept us equal.
Black and white, wrong or right we're all people.
Trying for better days, to let our kids see some.
Tenement Square, people fightin for freedom.
Beijing students fought armies with guns and knives.
At Kent State, they took four lives.
Nelson Mandela's not free.
Cause he can't even vote in his own country.
One day these problems will scatter.
Can't you see the Gas Face is no laughing matter?
Oh shit!

MC Serch.
There it is for ninety-one ninety-two ninety-three.

Prince Paul.
Yo whassup whassup whassup.

MC Serch.
Yo Prince Paul who we givin the Gas Face too now G?

Prince Paul.
Yo we givin the Gas Face to, Jerome Williker, of the Bronx.

*laughter*.

MC Serch.
Ye-yeah! Hey yo no Gas Face for Chantelle.
No Gas Face for the Brooklyn-Queens.
Connecticut Long Island New Jersey Strong Island posse.
None of them get the Gas Face.

Prince Paul.
Cause we love everyone! {*laughter*}.
Stupid man, y'all sick.

MC Serch.
Yeah we sick but we out too, peace.
