Alright Tho Lyrics
by Tyler Thomas.


Them been my niggas since we was on tyko.
My momma be calling to read me the bible.
Im hoping that money don't make me no psycho.
Well fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.
We'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho.
Fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.
We'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho.
Fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.

Jumped up outta bed put my threads on.
And my attitude fuck it but my head strong.
Gotta hustle when I'm up not when the bread gone.
And it's money in my texts can't have a dead phone.
So I reach into the stachebox, open up the padlock.
Im the seperation of the haves and the have-nots.
This the graduation from the bucket with the rag-top.
Rappin til I cop a lil Benz with the back cropped.
Same shit Ima say it over til you get it.
I come from a part of town where nigga's is never timid.
So why would the mindset of the youngin be any different.
When I everything that I own is 20 feet from my kitchen.
Flaws in it all I guess I find it amazin' that you fake niggas fantasize.
everything we escapin'.
I hope you learn your lesson first hand and embrace it.
That everything is never as real as you tryin to make it.

Them been my niggas since we was on tyko.
My momma be calling to read me the bible.
Im hoping that money don't make me no psycho.
Well fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.
We'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho.
Fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.
We'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho.
Fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.

Jumped up out my bed couldn't get it out my head.
A nigga ain't been sleepin.
I've been lookin like I'm dead.
I walk into the kitchen, put some turkey in my bread.
Need some juice to wash it down man I hope there's something left.
I know what's on my schedule I wish I had a double.
I bet the other me would probably get my ass in trouble.
That's why you only see a couple niggas in my huddle.
I don't even trust me how I'm finna trust another.
I gotta put some clothes in my trunk before I leave.
I'm busy making moves I don't know where Ima be.
I'm tryna get this money fuck a funky 23.
When you understand how dumb that you was as a teen.
My dreams are gettin bigger tryna get up out the shit.
Catch a nigga in Japan eating sushi off a trick.
So keep walkin', throw stones I'm Steve Austin.
Keep on livin my dreams I'm sleep walkin'.

Them been my niggas since we was on tyko.
My momma be calling to read me the bible.
Im hoping that money don't make me no psycho.
Well fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.
We'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho.
Fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.
We'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho, we'll be alright tho.
Fuck it I promise cause we'll be alright tho.
