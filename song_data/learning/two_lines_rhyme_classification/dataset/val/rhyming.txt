stuck on a planet Even time forgot and
your living in the past

learned theres a risk to take
full of pleasure and pain

chilling with the pharaohs and my ages has been
once again the illogical one
its gonna be good and hard
while I sink to the bottom
growing ancient lost within the mine
with faces cast in stone emerge into the light
you can-t see my flow with either of your eyeholes
and I can end your story at the tip of the iceberg
youve hurt me time and time again
at times you were my only friend
they don-t make it too far
stole a candy bar so I won-t starve
riding on this roller coaster
left behind a plane full of robots
the angels singing glory and praise
the angels of heaven were singing His praise
everyone heres story has been everyone heres story since the Big Bang
maybe that (is) what one (is) meant to have
nigga Im George Jetson and you George Jefferson
cuz this (is) murder to excellence

magnificent songs in a genius symphony
old World Old Tricks

emptily stretching out into forever

champagne
why can-t I catch a break
like youve been running for hours and can-t catch your breath
the demons are screaming so loud in your head
and the haze of the angels dressed in cocaine white
don-t wanna worry the rest of my life
growing in my shadow

fucking with that iodine
100 bitches on Me
but itll always be my number nine
sadly false brontosaurus

where will you go running when the grounds leave
and breathe out If youre still seeing red
alcohol and orphan tears
the sound of your voice ain-t enough
i miss you yeah I miss you so Im running running running
making bills off the same block that your kids play
Nina come and push my placement
i won-t hold back throw with all my arm
tired of squares taking up time while Im full throttle
ill head the concept so kiss my behind
stick it to the skin take a spike
suddenly I began to realize the eyes I did not recognize
i thought you were a ghost or a dream at most but youre everywhere
maybe redemption has stories to tell
what happens next
you and I in place
in an echo for your way
singing and screaming these useless rhymes
ive begged for death one too many times
escape the sorrow and restraint of mortal cities
give me time I will be clear
play with all of my new crayons
write it on the grave
soul
i could never turn from you if I did where would I go
but the dreams I had were the ones that were bound to happen
these nights left me with the simple satisfaction
everytime I travel far I think about you by my side
i hate to say this but my eyes go blind
line 1 caller hey hi how ya doing
red tie in an all black suit

evening of desire
i wonder how can some people dog a poor stranger so

(self-made) bastard severing family ties

torturous reflection remains of a spherical demise

i played myself like Eminem in 8 Mile
i can-t believe that I fell for that fake smile
who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree
no one wants a meal that only offers the least
trynna act hard You ain-t even at par
of this whole art Imma shuffle the cards
help me to learn to breath again
i know Ive lost my way
you drive me crazy when you hold me tight
are growing in the light
i see the works of gifted hands
that grace this strange and wondrous land
i thought it made me complete
out of nowhere it seems
looking up at another night sky
(is) a place where the dark conceals a heavenly sky
all the shots went to Marvin
damsel in distress getting bitter bout some shit she saw on twitter cause
i feel bigger than ever before
b I G bigger than I was before
singing while the suns out side
on me With my hand on the bible
so while the weather-s getting worse
something burning

Johnny Walker Champagne Brandy
unsung (is) the way
slowly to disclaim
and I keep walking on

and I know this world ain-t turning for us
get away from all this plastic love
look at the flicka da wrist

and my heart (is) yours
and my heart (is) yours
to realize that she was strong and he too weak to stay
and to realise that she (is) better off this way
house that Jack built up on the hill
just a drifter gonna kiss her first I gotta kill her mister
so we are it again
youre the one x4
from a man from an Asian clan
emotion too remaining

these Pots of gold have gone to waste so I got ta go

somebody take me away cause Im runnin out
guess that Im coming down
recollections of my pissed off dad

they were already smushed with a calm steady push to the side
hard drive
afraid youre gonna choke

i am beautiful
held a gun to my sister and said that theyd shoot
for tonight and forever forever and ever
its so easy we can be together for tonight and forever
but (as) the lead decays Im only getting sharper
landing in a soft cotton bed sleep med popping head rotting
there (is) a space in time
with sleigh bells and chimes
she got in Took it rather badly I felt
watching the Indiana Home for the Criminally Insane Glee Club on the Ed
the world that I know has broken its (choke-hold)
i don-t know I don-t know
and You Know Im Buying Somethin
and I Know That Back Side Somethin

now youre here to see whats hidden down in the haze
reload fast put a nigga in a can
i dare you jump tough youll be the next online
love (is) dead
mourn till dawn
my sixth sense kicked in reveals Timbs by the steel fence
some kids are real dense
its time to bring this ship into the shore

bring me up above
bring me up above
innocence won-t return
and my fire will burn
shane

a bad man with a serpent-s tongue n a silver spoon He-s choking on

nigga I stand beside the bride ‘  cause Im made of honor
you was my nigga I was with ya ‘  fore you made a comma
ive even strayed over to Pornhub Gay
and hell Ill admit Im not ashamed to say

filled with sorrow he falls to the floor
falling of a weak empire that stood too long

cries echoed out from the booth to the back pew
sun coalesced with the moon open wound
and I just can-t cope with it
(is) that I have no control of it
and well find another way to be happy one day
and well find another way to be happy one day
of coloured grey
(as) summer fades away
deathlessness (is) the curse that I bear
one thousand deaths on my sleeve (is) the cross that I wear
don-t forget all your clothes

she was the lighter to my port and the nicotine to my lungs
in the mirror saying look what Ive become
green

and youll never be my friend
the Tater (is) back with a salty surprise
i got style so crank up the dial
because maybe I
because maybe I
offered a passage of life
but Im sure that devotion and faith will make darkness subside
all the dreams we had
all the dreams we had
recollecting the memories eyes covered hazel
that I will rest sleepless till the sun rises on that day
about what you mean to me
and what it means to me
but its where I like to show my face
to go down to my favourite place
