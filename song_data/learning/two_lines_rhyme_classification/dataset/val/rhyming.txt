the stitches heal but the years are lost and
stuck on a planet Even time forgot and
your living in the past

this time they lied
learned theres a risk to take
full of pleasure and pain

chilling with the pharaohs and my ages has been
once again the illogical one
its gonna be good and hard
while I sink to the bottom
growing ancient lost within the mine
with faces cast in stone emerge into the light
you can-t see my flow with either of your eyeholes
and I can end your story at the tip of the iceberg
youve hurt me time and time again
at times you were my only friend
they don-t make it too far
stole a candy bar so I won-t starve
riding on this roller coaster
left behind a plane full of robots
the angels singing glory and praise
the angels of heaven were singing His praise
everyone heres story has been everyone heres story since the Big Bang
maybe that (is) what one (is) meant to have
nigga Im George Jetson and you George Jefferson
cuz this (is) murder to excellence

emptily stretching out into forever

champagne
why can-t I catch a break
like youve been running for hours and can-t catch your breath
the demons are screaming so loud in your head
and the haze of the angels dressed in cocaine white
don-t wanna worry the rest of my life
growing in my shadow

fucking with that iodine
100 bitches on Me
but itll always be my number nine
sadly false brontosaurus

where will you go running when the grounds leave
and breathe out If youre still seeing red
alcohol and orphan tears
the sound of your voice ain-t enough
i miss you yeah I miss you so Im running running running
making bills off the same block that your kids play
Nina come and push my placement
i won-t hold back throw with all my arm
tired of squares taking up time while Im full throttle
ill head the concept so kiss my behind
stick it to the skin take a spike
suddenly I began to realize the eyes I did not recognize
i thought you were a ghost or a dream at most but youre everywhere
maybe redemption has stories to tell
what happens next
you and I in place
in an echo for your way
singing and screaming these useless rhymes
ive begged for death one too many times
escape the sorrow and restraint of mortal cities
give me time I will be clear
play with all of my new crayons
write it on the grave
soul
i could never turn from you if I did where would I go
but the dreams I had were the ones that were bound to happen
these nights left me with the simple satisfaction
everytime I travel far I think about you by my side
i hate to say this but my eyes go blind
line 1 caller hey hi how ya doing
red tie in an all black suit
evening of desire
evening of desire
i wonder how can some people dog a poor stranger so
i wonder how can some people dog a poor stranger so

feeling ecstasy

now youre gone forever and the memories replay
back then you wouldn-t touch me unless I was in pain
we ain-t got no use for our old homes
working in my goldmines
and always stayed true to my home the great white North Pole
even when I wanted to I told myself that that one day Id be eating off a gold
(self-made) bastard severing family ties
became polyamorous so I could have 3 wives

torturous reflection remains of a spherical demise

we blow each others brains so entertaining
i played myself like Eminem in 8 Mile
i can-t believe that I fell for that fake smile
who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree
no one wants a meal that only offers the least
trynna act hard You ain-t even at par
of this whole art Imma shuffle the cards
help me to learn to breath again
i know Ive lost my way
you drive me crazy when you hold me tight
are growing in the light
i see the works of gifted hands
that grace this strange and wondrous land
i thought it made me complete
out of nowhere it seems
looking up at another night sky
(is) a place where the dark conceals a heavenly sky
all the shots went to Marvin
damsel in distress getting bitter bout some shit she saw on twitter cause
i feel bigger than ever before
b I G bigger than I was before
singing while the suns out side
on me With my hand on the bible
so while the weather-s getting worse
something burning
i had to smile from within
ivy Winters
i ain-t no dope addict who ever heard of a junkie (as) old (as) me
Johnny Walker Champagne Brandy
unsung (is) the way
slowly to disclaim
and I keep walking on
yet I keep walking on
and I know this world ain-t turning for us
get away from all this plastic love
look at the flicka da wrist
look at the flicka da wrist
or too grown to just cry
don-t hold it inside
we need to figure out just what to do
we need to figure out just what to do
oh city lights have led you all this way
the butterfly has landed on the psychedelic satellite

something will have to collide
i envy who comes next

oh nothing-s sweeter than summertime

who are you to challenge us No one just turn the other way
they who hope for a savior and stand idly by waiting for aid
mametz Wood and French Verdun
then in the heat the flies come down
number one
we making pay rolls
readin out speeches speakin packed with a passion
seein crowds cheesin off my tracks feeling magic

nigga I stand beside the bride â  cause Im made of honor
you was my nigga I was with ya â  fore you made a comma
ive even strayed over to Pornhub Gay
and hell Ill admit Im not ashamed to say

then he remembered where he was
along the shaft of sunlight
with your air days when you jump off on your chair
come on and lemme see your hands in the air

they rip your soul out of its place
when I am lost within your space
smash you up real good

im still alive but Im barely breathing
cliqued up still 40 deep
met a cutie named Catalina but she ain-t brave since they shot Selena

from the north to the west to the east to the south
from the north to the west to the east to the south
can-t stop not until he dies
body betraying the mind
i don-t care who you don-t like
someone clean to chew on a wife that no one likes
and the sunlight

i feel your fear it breaks my heart
these years of confinement have forced up the rage
are YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL DISGRACED

and well find another way to be happy one day
and well find another way to be happy one day
of coloured grey

i Can-t tell whats right from wrong
i set my sights in to the sky then realize its falling on all of us
too young to realize some things just can-t be done
and youll never get to see my face again
and youll never be my friend
the Tater (is) back with a salty surprise
i got style so crank up the dial
because maybe I
because maybe I
offered a passage of life
but Im sure that devotion and faith will make darkness subside
all the dreams we had
all the dreams we had
recollecting the memories eyes covered hazel
that I will rest sleepless till the sun rises on that day
about what you mean to me
and what it means to me
but its where I like to show my face
to go down to my favourite place
could it be that Im alright despite the flaws that Ive seen and lived â¦
