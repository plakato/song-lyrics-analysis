im saying all of this in hopes that I save some lives
just don-t fail me now
you don-t do me right

i woke up thirsty on an island in the sea
a death threat provides a thrill
undid our footprints even furled our flag and
we were gone but what was on the top of the mountain

what Do the people say Yeah

arrogance
have made our position unassailable
don-t matter who or what you been long (as) youre happy with where you are
bluff
just wear that love like a glove like a glove
with that simple Love The simple way
i remain only placid
carrying the weight of my conscience (as) a sentence
it always comes
and it came
jaymi
the demons are screaming so loud in your head
nobodys business if I do If I go to church on Sunday And I shimmy down on
despise me If I should take a notion To jump into the ocean It ain-t

im only a person whose armbands beat
i just wanted to be by your side
everyday everynight no more shall we part
i know that when the night (is) over
youre rocking with your girl friends
youre still my everything
hey Rosalyn
darkness wins the final battle
but in vain God (is) shitting on humanity
i tried to follow
i can hardly walk
you wear a smile but youre never to kind
but now I have to stop to wonder
they say a lot about me let me tell you what I think
writing and playing 2k how I always have fun
i got hops like bugs bunnny
and shoved her urethra down my throat
emotion too remaining
forces us go play then
you fit me like a glove
we were all best friends
are we not all not the same under the skin
of wanting change but not knowing where to start
and I heard you say I heard you say
you never hold me in his arms again
my career rose from the dead to over your head
overly fed in the booth Im a glutton
my team over everybody
and hit a nigga who done hold out
word on the road I get flown in bit
yeah yea yeah boy Im chosen
behind the obvious allegory of hollywood
disappear into the background
and his granny (is) so fed up
only 15 he don-t know how to be a daddy yet
old friends calling my phone telling me Ive turned fake

you said your life needed something special
than where (is) this

when your thoughts start sounding like noise
i ain-t here to break it
or how to begin in the end
id like to get to know you
i know youre antiseptic
a big big love
gigantic gigantic gigantic
and the bad sometimes are the good with a couple of crimes
for all my bosses who thought I always faked it
and if those chains were undone could you take it and run
i look for common threads where it all connects
whated you do Say it with a smile
look what it did for him
i watched friendships dissolve
theres always been a (table) for me there
and everybody-s packin up their station wagons
like a breast that you can suckle
and them pop stars and them rappers
and thats an everyday thang
and now Im just a slave to love just a slave to love
a victim of your touch you stole my soul
talking about a funny talking (honk-tonking) Georgia Peach
talking about a funny talking (honk-tonking) Georgia Peach x2

theres a darkening joy (as) Im both girl and boy

in the southern mountains zapata zapata
its not my fault that you can-t see where all the demons live
these devils can-t hold me back these niggas can-t say Im wack
no one really cares she remains out of sight
blinded by the models blinded by the stars

so now she-s working a job at a dead end
it wasn-t easy I stood like a man made of stone

and if Im being honest Im getting there
i unrolled a cheap cotton blanket on an old dirty couch
open your eyes to the suffering
and that can be a truth or lie
ile a sha
but they can-t afford my Timbs
won-t you stop chasing me because in these dreams I cry
every time I lay my head on my pillow I get fucked up
tip toeing up the mistake that I made
and now you know the truth and I know it hurts
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
if you feel it
how could I sink so low
every time we collide
but thats what makes life so amazing and I take pride in that
grease the palm and ironically that greases the hinges for doors to open up

adhd driving me wild
my heart experienced torsion
lost the purpose execution
thinking the sun blurring innocence of tired
i don-t want you to wonder why
you walked into the room
and we slid down on the beach and sand
tangled hair in my arms

they may be denying what im implying but what would lying do
every little once in a while
bring me little water Sylvie
diamonds they cover my neck and my wrist
fishtail the whip thats real (as) it gets
higher in the after light
we are the blaze that keeps you raising
selfish and stupid
and you balled up your fists but I laughed at your swings

and
something So beautiful in our eyes

im stuck here with all my guilt
and you know
no one may follow
we don-t wanna die in the ocean
my prophecy (is) almost complete
that I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath
last thing on his mind (as) he left this world behind
and thats all that I can ask for tonight

keep the comments away from my mouth
its too easy its too easy youre too easy the movie never lies
take a deep breath cause its your last nigga

in the floating world
if I was careless
started bangin with his pump and the bitch started twerkin- 
stuck the sweeper in her ass started sweatin like a dog
so now youre on your own won-t you come back home
to find another way
the world for you
that you and I can find a special place
teleporting shadow to shadow inside of Chinatown
and I guarantee well find it
don-t change I like the way you make me feel
youre always on my mind
yall ain-t workin hard (as) me thats facts
i just needa couple
its like fire
take this last breath and throw it all away
cause it could be the last thing that you say
this life (is) hidden in the sirens song
hanging tough staying hungry
just a man and his will to survive
my thoughts touching every second
eternity awaits
constant struggles on my mind
you know once you hand me the mic im gonna kill it
coming to this town honey (is) a showdown
but theres a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
when all the assholes follow suit
reiterate it one more time
i know I used to be a broke nigga too
never mind that silly ho
my last hope of freedom (is) turned into none
still all I see (is) a man on his knees
that was me before there was you
a ship with no guiding star
i don-t see you falling beautiful
to get inside you
my City
now make it home won-t be easy
its beating heart
when the light dries all the fields
refrain
cause I love to see you dream
i done been wrong I done came way to strong
preferably I think you being sweet with that recipe
i don-t know if you was playin but I know I gotta prove it
im feelin somebody fade when Im imcreasin the murder rate
break the Swisher Sweet down and fill it up with swag
rock out Uzi one nigga two pistols
take all your mistakes
leave your love at the door leave your heart on the floor
ill be your dead bird
theres no where left to go
some things may never change
like the way I see you
i need you baby I need you baby I need you baby
very well think that I know you too
tell against your will
this compared to being would be a mistake
from the top of the mountain to the rotten sand
oh oh oh
don-t let it fall apart
feel the warmth of the rays of light that shine upon you
im never the same
they wanna keep me down but I gotta grow gotta grow
past this aggression
besides what I hide and besides what I need
once I get my shot
all my niggas stressing
system of credentials Uncle Toms (upper-handed) grip
and I do this for the GeneraShun
creeping around like she was trained by the vietnamese
flirted with some dope then he slipped right back
world like a child plays tag
by the red the black and the green
my advisor (is) my gut
no one taught me
they followed insanity
with its icy embrace
leading me to distress
gone but still renowned
im scared of the fate that will become mine
this (is) where I arrange
but staying mad and hurt makes no sense
with you I felt it this euphoria
don-t know why we had to stress it now we ended up apart
keep it going on
slamming through
i can-t find any more
here we stand
a must watch all tune in
fall free you fuck with one of us you fuck with all three
break the hive and watch the hornets sting and swarm with killer form
the water I drink (is) the blood on my hands
pray
and this ain-t the easy way down
so if its gotta be you
theres just one thing that weve got to do
but you ain-t got no
never hearing a word I said
drain me and degrade me
how-s about me and you on the low what the deal
gotta speak first gotta let you know
i remember back in the day I used to be on that fresh shit
other I forget cuz my brain-s blown away
give you lines full of ether

las chicas de poster no saben bailar

these days got a nigga walking around with two phones to dodge these hoes
we keep pistols we tote ratchets
my jock loaded its tucked in
and start cleaning toilets
lest ye be cursed with leprosy
while I just lie here face down in an open grave
id rather die than let it show
so I just lay back and laugh at the sun
yesterday it rained in Tennessee

umm allergic to camera its a sodom and gomarah and spittin on selfies and
i really love my dame
funny how the numbers sway
and the sunlight in the fall even the coyotes call
turn it up one more time
so just drive away though I wish youd stay
all cut off (as) I stash em in fridges so hypocritical and unbearable taking
savage precision and accurate vision there isn-t anyone rappin specific
and we can light the stars the way we used to long before
you make it sunny when its raining out
burning niggas call that nigga incineration
wearing OF socks and ugly fucking green crocs
its like Im tryna see you but Im in a sandstorm
i got Bars for days fuck that centuries
don-t know whats coming next
i was born for it
Will I fall to ashes and never be reborn
blood red thorns to keep me caught
missile crisis time to light em up –  go
don-t get angry bird like I just hopped out the pig pen
perhaps of me youve heard
but youve left me little choice
im going to lose my aim
the longing for something that we cannot find
now you need a phat ass drop
snare drums can-t get enough
speak it with avid conviction
a sign of the limits that can prove problematic
with indestructible faith and you know we got to
there will be battles fight
oh oh oh oh oooh oh oh oh oh oooh
so climb out your window
a neverending dream a dream of you
im hunting on the night
and we light that tree remember when I was younger for fun we used to climb
they used to call and ask for bahta just to fuck wit me
just get to no me bit by bit
no more bluffing its Im a feel it in my belly button
love (is) what will set me free make us friends from our enemies
expression thats the key Im locked up in the beat
intimated by his fourteen year run WELL
for those in the past they know who they are
baby I got love to give baby I got love to give
like when I start to grow my secret garden
drop the groove now drop the cuts
get high to the rhythm we never stop
didn-t know what to think it was a dog with 2 pac and I said what the fuck do
so white like a cracker from a cracker box yo this cracker (is) about to jump
lek Ratt Coolio P S
he was carrying Doolieaburke in Armani bags
even when its breaking
and girl youre trying to cut me deep
you must have another to dictate to
im no longer your little boy
you were the sounds of distant cars
out of Mid-South in the eighties
and my mind gets walking watching the way you go
if youre thinking about thinking about
flesh removed
await in black
im tryna get a timeshare in every time zone
but the opposite (is) happening you find me where the hoes-ll be
i feel like an immigrant setting sale to my own mind
the destination (is) fuzzy all I can see now (is) the flames
he wants you to open up your heart
because theyre not sure that you could ever feel the same
and Im burning up inside
maybe were crazy but all we know x2
imposter competitors empty out their bladder
its the shadow stealth fighter liberator
im feeling physical
the pressure (is) mounting
concluding Sentence This (is) another part thats really similar To the essays
world history to get me ready for that gate way To last a life time Next we use a
higher ranking like Navy Captain to a Colonel

but she (is) the sun and has a drink
abigail won-t you take me to to the willow tree
oh I belong I belong with you
Till the stars start falling till the wind stops calling
training children trained to kill
no war No war can be one
go on and ask me to dance
and I wanted you to love me did you forget
i thought I knew the girl so well
and even though I confess them one by one
then I know Ill be welcome and I won-t have the stranger-s blues
im a stranger here just blowed in your town
that our existence should be defined
just to make a light that no one can see
turn out the spotlight Im tired Turn out the spotlight
but don-t you ever get lonely at night
and the way my bank erupt like burglars up in your home
trying to bader me Cause abuse to drugs and widows
and they outnumber guys like ten to one

left for dead four times survival (is) my theme song
youre a tree that grows hearts
the tide will show you the way
you could tell by the look in her eyes
and then you quickly turned into the enemy
on the beaches of my mind
sure there (is) a space today
my eyes are swollen at the sight of it all
i went swimming in the dark one day
so dry your tears and baby

but I rule like the British majesty
if you can-t love yourself
given all you could to the relationship
incinerate my skin
on our way through time and space
i want to go to bed every second
shes not the only one who won-t
let me break your spine so you can suck yourself Man then I hatched a plan to
end the life of the one in front of my gun
leave me the way that I still burn over you

equality doesn-t mean we go half and half
the only normal people belong to the circus

ill leave the light on for you for you
wake me up before you leave
where the lonely road ends
living on the outskirts forty miles away

i will never ch-choose any other way
cities full of hatred fear and lies
can-t we learn to feel whats right and whats wrong
even if its just in your wildest dreams
say youll remember me
they hate us cause they ain-t us
still waiting for something but what can we do
chasing relentlessly
and refuse to make amends
change racing through my veins
you make me feel so high
cleaning up for drunken friends
would you even know
i will carry a cross and a song
that all the riches the world had to offer me
only god learns 　 時 空 の 彼 方 　 い つ か は 辿 り 着 く の か ？

when we both get carried away
sweet silver bells

RuPaul

and a war with your bloodstream
waking up in a world surrounded by flames
i will never feel down
a barren future all too real
endless Lunacy
yo I look up to the sky and ask God what to do
thanks for the good and the bad times
oh just stay
at the lovers of the night
youre terrible inside
i am
to realize that she was strong and he too weak to stay
brief candles in his mind bright and tiny gems of memory
ill walk you home
your all alone you watch your back
when red roses bloomed for us
this (is) our last goodbye
theres a snake coming out of the darkness
the night turns thin
so where I am (is) only where I need to be
what you exude (is) only what you want to
im still in love with you
starting over (is) the hardest thing to do
what am I to do close minded
make no mistake theres no compromise
the town hall-s a saloon
and the women are whores
the momentum (is) passing but the moment (is) eating us whole
look at this ocean with everyone drowning
i will never let them down
anywhere I go cuz I promised my people
i never thought youd leave without a trace
oh tell me what were fighting for
and dumb with no lunchmoney
sittin by myself with the pistol in the middle on the devil
the world (is) made
‘  Cause everyday
ice ice ice ice
call it back pack
you turn around you see me now
i want you just because
something-s flipping all my switches
and theres no antidote
this fog (is) not enough
but no one-s there
i live to sever bodies so melancholy
pullin plugs on the microphones
im the ice cream man she chunky monkey
she wanna fuck and suck but I ain-t gon rush it
if they were to make friends wed be possibly up
if I stared at the willows with my seven black truths
to curse the stars with vertigo
tall cedar groves and graves sublime
yes Im with your ho but I still want the enchilada
rep my shit like where you going hold up nah where you from
when the time moves faster than a bullet from a gun
like a sunset etched right across your face
take it while its hot give it all you got
so now it seems weve slipped into reality
the buggy code of my internal workings
after youre awake
i got 9 real niggas thatll beat your ass quick
you know I got the acid and its all on me
im tryna get embedded

labels tuggin on my arms
i got two middle fingers up if you don-t care for me
cause rap made me crazy rock made it worse
im just a kid with a mic and Im rapping like a God you see
counting degrees on a thermostat
those Ronzoni sweet shells
one thousand deaths on my sleeve (is) the cross that I wear
i have awakened from the sorrow
the luxuries will have to wait until my budget ain-t so tightly wound
coals uh

pry open my third eye my mind (is) ready to die
the industry frowns on my hustle for being a cracker
somebody take me away cause Im runnin out
the old soul inside of me (is) cold snow
feel your heart while the world feels like its falling apart

you set me up you made me true
i was back at the river with you
she gave me a kiss and an ORCA pass
i begged and pleaded with her day after day
hands around my waist
here in the moment on the dark side of the screen
amp You hung up cause I was caught up in the rhyme
im a little lost I hope I find my way
always on time time time time
little red caboose behind the train
and I know I should have told you
taken by the tones of the Cactus and the Rose
yo its pitiful you wanted me to drop but now Im this god
shedding tears with a hand on my chest
when it comes to confrontation you break youre fake
i don-t like how these people look at me they shake their head in misbelief I
that silence
that drowns commotion
pooh
all
theres a darkening joy (as) Im both girl and boy
and with that its done to can you help me
only left before I see you next to me Takes so alone It-s falling to a
in the bloody moon Whistling for the road The honest seen view The longing
flutter round your eyes
go to sleep-y little baby
and it was like I fell asleep
the silence was so perfect
to make you leave me but what I do know
soaked with love are my thoughts of you
y-all really don-t get it don-t get it
i know I got my issues baby I just ask you to love me like you do
we lay your fate in devil-s hand
Till we reach the end of this world

you drove off in your fancy little car you started headin for the joy
i was cruisin gonna ride out to the red light
you know the person we all see in our mind-s eye view
girl your heart (is) a therapeutic mattress that I want to rest my soul on
then I sort out the bullshit and available nonsense
faucets make medicine for madmen
where you gonna go
i dare you to lift yourself up off the floor
but it works
like playing games
breakin Denver Nuggets like styrofaum
its pure gold in rhyme form
sadboys tattoo in Times New Roman
all my boys got stacks of cake

lands strength a rolling home
wandering the freedom trail don-t let this man be me
before the well inside of me (is) running dry

to be your own best friend
so you got your bulletproof vest your (sawed-off) shotgun

and we will burn out our eyes
got the angel on my shoulder but a demon to my right
and you may not know my motives but quotas they can-t control us
i went and bought a new head she said
shout your love the stars are black
theres a shark
but I believe its true
Lil Pusha T s in the game I simple knock off
pusha T
runnin-  That-s the only reason I got good head cause them bitches was loud
see ten tons of animal fury leap from the screen
i want you
youre the type of girl my friends would tell me all about
but shout out Section better winners over my section
catch me slipping thats a one off mate
there are days when I
i will wrap my arms around you
ohhhh
then attack the sea hoping that it fractures
later tonight
won-t you look at the evening
youre wasting all my time
you knew Id lost control
if you don-t know me then you should listen
make you think Im making mils just like the Lakers
ill roll up my beddin and pack up my clothes
send our mail to the end of the trail
the troubles that we know are hidden under starlight
and watched the lights arise
beautilekkka
yeah
feel strong like an oiled machine all the anger boils within
stole it back now praying in the dark
id say that I was all alone
find your legs and find your horns
ill pull this pistol
she clutched the pearls said What in the world
i be on the roll like drums in a band never parking the beat
spit 2 hard kill a dead beat twice
say now you have changed but tomorrow well reflect loves past when the winter
but very well I believe I know you very well wish that you knew me too very
all thats been and all I see now
wandering through broken shadows
sex kills
shuttle days
i thought we was cool why you want me to die homie
don-t look to the sky no more
crush a bit little bit roll it up take a hit
uh uh fuck that
a chance to prove restrains their fear
when man was made and man will fall
Jesse went down bouncin and jumpin said
his heart was thumpin
why am I (flippin-) I just bought them condoms
just my luck the bastard ain-t die
workin on myself while you busy being replicas
like a Bob the Builder from the hood I bring the hammers out
i don-t get the world just to get the guaca
dollar for my thoughts dollar for my thoughts
louie
i like her more this way but whos to say
out came the matches but they were covered in water
leader of the small and a stranger to the goodies
electron John
your fluffin bass surrounds you
dozens laid rest settled down then at last
i drive up to your door and wracked by disease
missed all of the sunshine and gave you the reigns
falling from the ashes right
playin halo 4

all I want (is) Actavis
for days may god bless it
face it …  life-s to short to be basic
dark fears are wanted
i can no longer close my eyes
looking for a guru such a decision
clarified butter from the holy cow
the darkness settles in when you least expect
so read between the lines you can see the bigger issue
Tim grabbed the automatic from under his daddy-s mattress

the caress of seven angels
merchants weeping
karmas got a bite like déjà vu
and now you know the truth and I know it hurts
thats my generation
flares of light crashing on our shores
no hope in the mirror

and chasing birds I don-t got the patience

two emcees going in going off look how the vocals come off
breathless gasping for air for in thy dreams you were there
take the heart from you and the blood ceases from me
i just spit out a hit and make the money appear
ill make your ma cum through the telephone

outside the shelter of your tender arms
its been forty days and nights since we said our last goodbye
higher than Mariah in a choir full of violins

your the sun to my rain
if tonight you should leave (as) the ghost in my life
through those gates no turning round

the spear bearers the elephant riders
it fucked with me being out there I couldn-t stand it
i wonder if it fucked with their conscience
shake it shake it like you bouts to get paid
rolled up sleeves with a carton in its fold
a millions clones of Korn and Limp Bizkit

in peace I can-t rest
but still the great beyond awaits

its hard its so hard
where are you
revolution it seems has become an antique
reduced to mere history
you ask about me in a church they say Im missing a soul
reap the reefer in my mind
i don-t belong there I don-t belong anywhere
i know I wasn-t perfect but this love must be true
but this round Im sitting still in ponder and awe
without being told down by their peers
pretty colors everywhere
crowd controllers

before you come to bed
and I believe this costume party (is) over
what hit me when I fell down in silence
why CAN T YOU SEE ME WINCE UNDER KNIFE

the melting pot of a (super-futureesque) style
we in it for the Cream of wheat and everybody-s got ta eat
no doubt I keep a grave yard in my fatigue pocket
i have one thing to say you better work bitch
work turn to the left
she showed me what a real woman suppose to be
these cats around town carry gats for protection
been and what Ive been doing
were connected at our hip and in all our orifices
and all the times we called good memories
and if we make it through this night I just pray you feel this pain
there can be only one one one one
Will soon be will soon be will soon be done

im feelin like a game of hide and seek I wonder who youll try to find first
ive cried a thousand times in despair of what we are
but with our last ounce of strength we need to ask … 
eyes that will never see the same again
with a hate filled heart
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness
(goose-stepped) us into misery and bloodshed

verbal crucifixion when I jump on a track
i found you in your rain …

cold heart has been lost with my armor that arrives on a small lift
he took my neck but I willingly tied the noose
how could I love what Im dying for
i should prove true to my emptiness
i should climb down off my rugged cross
angel dust I get religious snorting coca on a nun-s ass
and take advice from the biggest pedo
make a uturn to see how longer it can last me
cause you know I work in profession when I ride it

i thought that you changed instead you got me again Dear Love

sky of white and nylon blue
and let my soul fly
pavement beneath my feet
you can taste the pretence in the air

when someone step to me it be villainy ventriliquism
i refrain from few but I won-t remain silent

cipher part 1
coming for your soul man
like everything he feens for personified
(liquor-breath) from hell

sky falling catch it all open handed
flip on the fog machine and the laser beams
slightly spoke a few rhymes killed some few lines
i dont need no bodyguard pull up late anybody guard
who dat there got them jays at the door in the room

even niggas in limos passin out they demos claimin that they shits like
song we throw it out
and there will never be another

when you die you can stand up for me
we can lie in a homemade canoe

i see the life I never had before
that could be possible
upon the hill across the blue lake
yeah
appreciate things so I stopped doing the most grew out of ADHD the schools
grew up fancy like Michael Jackson Oprah Winfrey and like this I used to be
its time for Valentine-s Day to be abolished
but I guess the task (is) mine to explain with fantastic rhymes
i am the firedevil
because I don-t know mercy
well I don-t want you
and let that whiskey be
you need a cause you want to make a stand
you port the leader baby kisser grandma greeter
locomotion through the microphone cord
drop jewels and acknowledge the icons abolished
check IT OFF YO WISH LIST

sour and ringing and lost to this world
blue shock exchange blue shock exchange blue spark

confusion all over my mind but still I be bustin rhymes
the Grouch

plus He was brought up well
someone Give me a voice to guide me home Oh

discover faceless enemies
pretendin yall not stupid
though the violence ain-t stopped

loving you has made my life complete

this was all a fantasy of yours
and youre so sad It-s too bad I wish you could-ve had what I had

Caroline well find a place that makes you feel apart
with responsibility comes new found abilities
tried to ask for forgiveness but still got no reassurance
glide with my frisks
what can I do to pep it up
don-t know why your son came out a (one-legged) albino queer
hold your guard don-t get took
don-t write no letter
don-t want no woman who dont know right from wrong
to raise the debt ceiling temporarily but it would not end the partial
government shutdown
look past the blinding light look past the blinding light
well just keep talking on
like galaxies at the end of time
am I even a human at all
ill pick you up let you down in the end
somewhere in the dust I know well find it out
but who (is) the artist
no crowds to cheer
now I wonder what (is) the perfection in the relationship attraction
days goes and goes with a puntured relationshit
youre sitting high and Im feeling lost
dark was the night cold was the ground
but light (is) a vanishing hope
but life (is) a murderer
everything going to throw a way 　 until the gods shine down on this world
dancing all night 　 狂 っ た よ う に
walk up in the club see this fat bitch joggin
aye that nigga passed me up
foreign Ty coming live from the side
hard for me to see y-all Im so focused
not hard to sleep on a bed thorns
the blood trickles down but your eyes still dry
i found my phone in the bed clothes
and the curtain glowed crimson through the window
well burn us straight to hell
cause theres nothing we have that popularity can-t cure and were almost
writin rhymes thinkin how Ima be on
you plus rap

until my people came
i need a quick drink more volume for the beat

these lyrics were submitted through RapPad Write Better
all the faded memories they come back to me
years turned to days and
there a spatial gap (is) looming anomaly
all at once I can not see
ive been hiding for a while
we won-t have to keep on waiting waiting waiting waiting
i don-t know why I stress on them
run it back like a blunt
for you a chilvarous end for a man
sirens calls of temptation
i got this tendency but
youve got to stop to watch it
like the songs Im making I deliver thats why your shaking shake shaking
set the mood red green blue lights (is) blinking on the tree while Im getting
or better still be my winding wheel
and Im standing in the station
moms honor roll daughter and daddy-s little girl
he finally thought he was a man and had it made
so now I try to picture you with all the kingdom I can-t find
a battle now for every single thing I do
baby lets trip you can go and get your shrooms on
started from the bottom now we here
now my heart-s a bid for you You put all your quid onto
slowed
they want your heart
agents of love
just grin and bear it
acts of controlling
all the pain that I feel
(is) he handsome
whywhere there (is) desire
eh eh eh
i got eight fuzzy fingers of death examine the math
and I been floating all night let my flows explore
im hurt and I will be with you forever
sometimes you make me angry other times you make me glad
ryan
i want you to know
hail hail hail
oh beat the drum for Him a holy measure
when emotions take over just dead the disscussion
then niggas get on the mic and spit a fantasy killer life
don-t need to pray for all their lives
and then I probably lost the count
but when you realize its awkward your name still my password
but moments wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
p Talking till the end of the song
be all you can be
were just some (have-nots) tryna master the system
i am Shakespeare with great hair
why Im not there
a social reason
i don t want to
you my friend
when you talk a lot but you can-t see
start to feel good and I can-t go on again go on again
buried six feet and Im just another missed grave
but if I do let be for somethin real
i could be I could be I could be your girl
be all your wildest dreams
i work my fingers down to the bone
baby oh its real I know I know I know its real
yes I can tell that you can-t be what you pretend
the red and yellow mane of a stallion horse
livin in a ghetto world
like the seasons when they change
across the continents
sometimes you creep me out
Lu Lu youre my secret girl
everything I think of (is) about you
sitting here with nothing on my mind
are we looking for the only cosmonaut
stay stay you thats the toughest thing to do
by dragging up the past Ill put you through it all again
theres nothing going wrong theres nothing going down
she set the path we are walking down again
just know I said it ugh Indigo protected
what you in here for
he saw a white church with a
there (is) one bird in my house
its getting late now
don-t stop doin what youre (doin-)
somebody need to get me outta this place
watch your mouth and what you talk about
hey my higher power
its the beginnin-  the beginnin-  the beginnin of another day
this function fails again
walking machine with no highs
so you give up and
everybody knows
i turn the music up Im on a roll this time
and we saw oh this light I swear you emerge blinking into
hold me when I lose my grip
you gotta keep against the grain
wouldn-t you try to find something else to bring you up
never know what you find
they rip your soul out of its place
if you don-t leave me
there (is) nothing now
set us free
poppin the pussy we gettin so high
pussy so good Im crazy (as) fuck
an Showed up the Funeral
hear it Use a Open Mind
future watch my ego wash ashore
but made it far worked hard I said it in my album people never believed me
cross the hall to your room to sneak a peek
nzt in my mouth an indecent amount
i remember the day it was my birthday and she told me that she really need a
rwhisky Champ-Nothing Last Forever

on the same block the chedda and he came throwed up in the club singing let
so saying that you betta mean that lightning will strike you
but I couldn-t make it on my own
the single life (is) not for me

but the chalice reminds me of home let me out
what did you say to love

throw a hundred G-s in the crowd feeling like I hit the lotto (as) Im 19

and Ive already read your mind
youve got a pretty face
did him dirty and ran away whos the next candidate
we can go back and forth and pour yay
and you always have my heart
well this has been nice
but those wretched snakes would rather stay representing
in dirty pharmaceutical industries than (as) of today
the one who plays the victim
you don-t understand and
my only claim to fame was you
i followed you through every trend
because I still love you
youre on my mind
riding high on the PCH
where theres a plan theres money
but you know I can-t wait that long
i want you right here

pop that pill
watch me get these Benjamins
to have the skills without the funds or the deal
any nigga with a mic can get heard
come with me to a place far away
come enter the world in the shadows
and Im not sucking a tionarys Dic til my knees hurt
god walked out randomly left me fatherless
if you want a love thats easy
then I would rather have nothing
Till you touch a razor blade
there will be 39
im the Michelle of PD
yungs don-t run out of heart
i fear theres nothing in our love
its you I love to hold
like a dollar sign
but I can see you I can see you
gotta do and not of what I did

in turpentine
when it all went a fuck in the snow that gets pushed to the side
feels so good youre coming home soon
walking the way we used to walk
humanity
if were adding to the noise
that the child once born in bethlehem
who can know
but I can-t walk no mo so I decided to take a seat
eat our food then we gone on these bastards
but I don-t have no say
but Ive lived long enough
how innocent a baby (is) how can you put it to death
and one that they can not have
got my heart beating out of my chest
she-s ready to rock
drowned in a distance Im so safe and sound
machines that make me breathe I just can-t stand their terrible scream
or am I destroying myself
safer (is) ignorance
i see you I feel you
so I cut off all the petals to watch them all wilt
who am I Who am I Invisible
i just walked away
and life was hard until I started going harder
i might just break your ankles you might just lose your knees
going to the cookies Well I got the protein

a blank mind with a spine made of cartilage
everybody wanna be a rap artist now

and when the lights go down
its power (as) it dances with me
lies and feelings sold
oh my closed eyes
unidentified remains
so you drink more alcohol to heal your cotton mouth
you tell yourself that youll only do it one time
dont slip on the morning dew
you can cheat and run
don-t laugh at it youre probably trying to straddle it
to your mouth cause Im such a philanthropist
she-ll start acting normal again
maybe if I call her once more

morbid schemes while reaching fame
slower than a bullet leading there
cold Dark Black Eyes
the dark ones return to us unleashing a plague
killer ripper who are you
he found the killer weapon in his car on the floor
lavender fingers
you had me howling

enough oxygen for me to breathe

Mary
Nikki Am I closer
hey girl youre a strong one

ros Swann Digge Doms Ding Ding

so the child sat up and began to speak for himself and said
its not that I think your not willing can-t do it or just dont wanna but the
get you a new pair of shoes
you were that first sweet taste of Mary Jane
im going through withdrawals
but you can bet each time I leave
calling me with a forearm tan
and with no one to care for you
little blossom shining in the sun
water wet water wet wet water
(sixty-two) its jumping back
god doesn-t give with both his hands
they say the hardest part (is) leaving you
you adore wasting time
like you don-t remember loving me
and lay beneath the trees
it was all that I could do
youve always been gifted with the rightest touch
we run it like athletes at track meets
take my hand while the whole wide world it feels like drowning
don-t let it fall apart
and the earth (is) without form and void
and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters
we have lost ourselves to the rise of opposition
would we all still battle if this caved in beneath you
when you have not been you never feel it
(as) the world turns we all live in the box
she-s been by maybe you hate me
but for real though we go hard on every single flow
on the set it be Benz-s Beamers
it be plenty of food and plenty of fun
back to you
i can-t remember seems like forever when was the last time I felt your
this mighty mighty love
on the day that God said let there be light
the energy drained with the anger I instilled upon you
let me kill you what do you have to lose
you know exactly where Ive been
but I don-t want to make this awkward anymore
we can see for forever not a cloud in the sky
you know it wants to come out
then things started changing
theres no going back now
slip down open over such smallity
important to the soil to make ladders
im going Frank Lucas front row at the fight
or I feel for everything that can-t be touched
keep gossiping like bitches typing all up in editor chat
im bashing your heads 6x and in your mouth Im shoving shit
open the wound
stench of rotten cunt meat
do the young stay pretty do the pretty stay quick
you know but you never surrender
love thats ever closer
when the fallen angel
no pressure or anything
no pressure
and she said that I had it wrong
what if she don-t come back
all my life I wonder what it was to behave they said
just a Lil bad ass yellow boy
gonna drink goon straight outta the sack
with whoevers round me
ill put holes in your chest with my laser cannons
with this gun on my arm and this look in my eye
with our little boots we built another world
where were chain chain chain chain chained to the light
for sometime I go to classes
its getting blurry in my eyes
if I stop believing in you
diamonds
in the eyes in the eyes of my ghost
oh how Ive walked this white line
when deeds are measured in their act when thoughts are welcomes not attached
last Bayou
fears and judgements Ill never understand
looks like a bag of cheetos exploded
you can find me if you open your heart
ill be that little voice inside your head
flaking you are a nice little one
it took ages to think
who did you just distrust It-s Serch and I crush this
asses bounce to track that (is) all in
words just ain-t enough baby baby
i can-t wait each day just to shake you up
im running a whole record label and Im off in college doing things
making a SoundCloud
i ain-t never see you no ready
if he mad wile out go along good girl wile out
she roll one I roll four
money on my mind all day big safe
so put your clothes back on
but now the morning light (is) here
where I wind up (is) on my mind
take me down with the vessel when you go
with bananas n others inserted in the night
it started one night when we where alone
energy
search the world over and yet you were right over my shoulder all we need
our love (is) at an end
with your summer love that will let me down
i dream Id have a clue
and I I I only came for you
between our friend and enemies
refrain
my minds out of touch
but I fade
but knowledge doesn-t come with a tag that shit (is) priceless
except hes not married and hes a kinda ugly kid
old news y-all niggas (is) old news
my bitch built like Mona Lisa with a platinum Visa
all I Do (is) Smoke x3
you ain-t on my level roll a plane come take a flight with us
i really do care that world (is) not fair like you
if Im honest I am just tired
i don-t know
what am I doing here
were heading for global destruction
no one survives at the bomb drop
we live in
we live in Shangri La now
and word by word they handed down the light that shines today
a ray of hope a shining light Ammonia Avenue
guns and ammunition guns and ammunition
woah what have I done Im the burning man
you are my only one
you are my only one
its when the world comes and anoints
they used to call me the shark
for all to see
hold it down
just cut the pack
and I smell blood
you were always on my mind
give me give me one more chance
ay ay put the kush in I need that steering
high outta my mind pisses the palm trees
i don-t want you to change
because everyone has hopes youre human after all
and if I leave it up to her ill probably get a call sometime this spring or
even feel sad feels like theres no one left there to feel at it just
before I got kicked out of God-s Garden
nothing going to stop me from making these other MCs outdated
what can you do what can you say
its time to make a step its time to make a move
feels like a party every time you come around
you made me love you like I thought I never could
and Love will be our guide
rest your head on my shoulder and sleep
calling out your name
you think yourself a breaker of these
you feel me Niggas tryna hit licks on a young ass nerd you feel me
but they don-t understand my notes Im too motherfuckin smart
its Picasso pictures have pain oh yeah
bay profit
me a pink smile Walking up the aisle Show me the things underneath
squealing pig Like a train with wheels In the dark with the lights
were not radioactive but well melt your face
phantom Menace striking back lyrics Rushing like Zerg
i can-t forget what we claimed was ours
eternity awaits
it never made sense to me
to do the things
when I
what the hell we supposed to do
cause my career I fear (is) here for a meaning
attackin the media with fire iron bars shiny cars fuckin up your stereo
i can feel the power comin ´  down on me
now I ´  m gonna fight ´  til the day I go free
won-t serve where I lay my head at
hol Up Po up
and I ain-t gonna front I never wore no NIKES
work ethic charisma and yeah a bit of an asshole
the fire reflected in their eyes
happiness spreading through the air
on this battlefield yea my eyes are red
high grade high grade
not like my ex or the house that I leave in
ok Mr nothing turned myself into something
carried my sins far away
from east to west
how long will it take you to see
this (is) our progress last year from now weve come so far
written off my heart
there ain-t nothing that could
no weenies
cause you representin California
i got more little angels than youll find in the promised land
but when my main line comes back home
thunder whispered low so
ill whisk away your heartsigh
i beat that pussy up Made it hurt and glisten
now Im driving mami crazy like her purse (is) (missin-)
we build houses filled with many dreams and goals
an African noble and admirable
down the murky side of whatever perfect life he would interpret for the night
overkill leave all the hunters gassed over ill
in my life we spitting them raps
me and these flows (is) heaven sent
watch the stars collide (as) we fight
like oceans rising waves of blood consume
livin a charmed life everything-s workin out right
she acts so nonchalant but the girl gets everything she wants
confuses you one worthless heart (is) screwed
im saving (as) payment
my neighborhood was also bird shit
you never thought the world was unkind
on fading reflections
stare through the eyes of my mirror master
jumped up out my bed couldn-t get it out my head
them been my niggas since we was on tyko
whos going to tell you its all right
its your birthright
never arming any hammers but I do evoke crack
or try vaguely defy lazy vie greatly
this (is) the end of everything we know my darling
to atone
girl what do you say
from the bed of a pickup truck
voice John F Kennedy
this decade (is) out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to
but we just gotta just be friends so don-t act
im bout to do
what I have taken long before I
down by your side I will stay
don-t come up to me and talk (as) if were homies
i remember every word every word you said
just like the president-s
slamming through
cause I wanna be your man
but I can-t be your friend anymore
just roam the world until the lights come on
comptemplate my life (as) I drift along the shore
obviously we don-t even care for our own shit
i love turning up like the next man don-t get me wrong
i guess well never make it back
i want you to look at you tonight

skillions folk just went official

no need for a leader
my buddy Dallas he got a cabin down on the riverside
aw she sure does like it dirty
but til that morning
and the living (is) easy

and like you normally do it
and she steals more than she buys
and she-ll come back (as) soon (as) she-s ready
unfortunately we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at

but fucks giving who affected
put her on a noose

the cops must-ve took you down
stay up all night Do what insomniacs do
i hate how topics in my songs keep switchin
dragging me off again
and Im feeling the pull
she don-t need to know no she don-t need to know

so you sick sayin youll get with my clique
wanna know about the music biz don-t know pass man
but the only thing Im Downing (is) cans
youre getting laid down
look at my bow wow sitting there
alcohol drugs and rock n roll
wrong notes but the melodys so clear
i found my treasure in you
once I make the payment the hits out
shots rang out you could hear it for a couple blocks
peering through the glass I see what it could have been in two years time

and now she tryna be tellin me
our relationship expression
she brag about me to her friends when she on the phone sex so good that she
comes on cue
she feared the light
she sacrificed
i got caught up and I fucked with snakes
id be lost without you in my

its a mans world
and youll play the part well
ill be in Mi Tierras with a margarita in my hand
texas (is) Texas (is) my kind of town Texas (is)
the mine has fallen down on you
hey Hey Hey HEY
solitudes frustration has been our only friend
when justice (is) lost the system fails and all we do (is) pay
my soul (is) mine
even though you think youre alone theyre always everywhere
until I end up with my head hitting and meeting the ceiling
it seems by my anger that Ive been released from my prison
aguila
with so many songs released by high hitting and underground artists alike
bitch please switch the Ds
i got em surrounded they be calling five o
and under the rubble
ill hold you forever
the sun and water were like me and you
but love burns and she wasn-t lookin back
i know I know I know
it wasn-t enough for me
now I know you got the message please stop making it so hard
im too far away
and we used to be something
oh my God when she was mine
popping pills and they asking why
and see how I react
youre a liar youre a cheater youre a fool
go for all the better things in order
but somewhere else inside my dear
where do you go
the blunt breaks in the corner we still hate being sober
pot smoking (is) best but the poison holds closer
watching spoofs fill us full of happiness
im outstanding an outlandish clam dish
scary pictures behind the curtain
all I do (is) lay awake
jump up jump in the house
we rejoice in Your name all day long
looking to God to get saved huh
the smoke sitting on the water getting blown to the sky
a black boy from where the black boys die
im kinda not but she barely even noticed it
only darkness every day
ain-t no sunshine when she-s gone
i raped your bitch call that forced anal penetration
theres blood on the leaves but no time to grieve
enlighten this dark goes into lightness
goals to fuckin conquer
i know its not a lot lot lot
look in your eyes and know just what you meant
my solution (is) make life what you can make it
real cats are gonna wanna know who this dude (is)
its time to beware
its too late to realize
don-t want another heart break love
heart heart heart heart heart
ill put holes in your chest with my laser cannons
a virus that makes me want all cowboys dead
ive canned a date to can a kick-on on all of these cats
skiddin on these whack acts Like mudflappers
whispers fill the waiting hollows
darkness stands for death-s inspection
look at the world around
crawl right in through your window
cleans her teeth ten times a day
hes a germ free adolescent
confined by what can-t occur in our mind
words that are steps to where something else could be
this (is) how it feels ridin 500 horses
10 stacks to race do I have any challengers
they ain-t coming back no its too late
im all alone on a midnight ride my 16 kids they all have died
deep inside it feels right but in reality its wrong because
girl you gotta man on the side
in a day or two
oh things that you say
everybody wanna play with that brother now
kids they used to be wheelies for blocks
im in love with you
they try to pull me away
how to love
no one takes the blame
never gonna find ya body
bowie
and thats all that I can ask for tonight
lets do it all over again
in my fu (*) king world Ill never be free
the more I have to pay
and every day my misery just seems to grow
sit like children in a ring
flash back (pre-game) beer pong and (flip-cup)
ive got all my bags packed up and Im goin to the moon
you put this in me so now what
i wanna be your baby
imprisoned and alone drowning in the night
slowly surely purged clean
so now were all grown up and settled down
youll do it again and again and again
John C Reilly
this (is) the regret that you make
call me cracked pavement Im in the streets
lose myself to the haze and the memories
reading magazines
its a hard thing to love anyone anyhow
if my eyes were to see what belongs to your mind … 
to escape from this world from this no past land

my boy-s mother got cancer the same time (as) mine
in my experience they can-t help but be smug
to satisfy your intellectual need
everybody wants a piece of the action
one false move and you hearin the blap blap

what Would it be like if I had somtime with you tonight

and run up in schools and go mass murdering

and im missing my queen

one day Ill be leaving you better believe
rasters and vectors keep switching
especially when Im gone for so long losing feeling in my heart
and I ain-t trying to hear my number but it could be the next one called
the testament to your singular disease
and in their faces their expressions
but thinking on them arguments gone lead us both to vomit
it was march 12th to be exact do you remember that
ancient Flesh Dark Gods
unholy inHuman sacrifice

business if I do Lord no Well it ain-t nobodys business if I do
despise me If I should take a notion To jump into the ocean It ain-t
i talked to God and she laughed with me
my eyes are swollen at the sight of it all

ive been leaving messages on an answering machine
and I found myself alone
they all try Incomprehensible
couldn-t trust no more if he tried

with whoever we want Go ahead and try to tell us we won-t
come on Come on Give trouble just a little kiss
baby you smile a lot
you see me on stage
but now youre running out of breath
i know youve got some fight in you
by the next bus stop
pouring wine and pushing opinions
duck and maneuver ain-t no opponent my rhymes (is) potent
wheres the love when you want it
like Curtis Mayfield if theres a hell below we both go
the menace in me was never some
the jungle on my shoulders
every time I hop the beat its recognizable
refrain
i can-t take control
kush packs on young Piccolo
with my superpowers like Im Super Sayian
i never
dressed in all black
we will look back in anger
but theres no release
and the sweetest girl in all the land
i bought her a gown
at least I try to
and They say one day the sun-ll shine through but
but everything they do (is) just (as) stereotypical
true strength (is) the strength to be honest
remember that we sew with the same cloth
erase me with the flaws where I stood
she-ll make a killing even if she ain-t fine
a little bit of cash and the question that she asks (is)
youre my angel in the snow
hmm yeah Ill follow
they cum in her mouth to prevent her from talking
or end up like me and see green when you pee when you wake up tomooo-aaa

a walking pharmacy and honestly none you niggas harming me
i ain-t have a L WE WAS STILLL TAKING CARS OUT

for all we have (is) today
and the curtain glowed crimson through the window

i want to know
swing batter batter batter now my pockets gettin fatter
all you twerps all rap the worst bet ill make you all disperse

rocking through the midnight hour
praise Satan
a single word
because Ive felt this way before
predictably yours
but joy comes once you
calm your fears
talk about a day when you can-t pay
playing wicked games with ya life till it weakens
the day you were born a solid mark
and maybe and maybe I was right all along
in hopes that you both will find romance
and if you are
a sigil of death
beneath this night
i make a bed for a beat and I chill in it
for 48 hours where the roaches are majority
you and I you and I and dominoes the day goes by
don-t you want to know with your pretty hair
im gonna show yu the way
grand canyon
and the temperature in the room decreased when I enter and whisper
when she-s asleep she thinks she-s dreaming and doesn-t wake up
kickin up the carnage and stuffin em into coffins
thats why im dope mutherfucker theres no arguing
almost presentable next to you
im barely hanging on
brandish her wand with a feathery tongue

or better still be my winding wheel
every time you think of me I hope your heart dies
youll pay for everything youve done
television dreams of tomorrow

well just because I don-t pray

yung Lean only attracts an older clientele
slitting wrists while dark evil spirits like Slitherin

hand picked from solely failure list
and finally youre here with me tonight
one hand tied behind my back and still your breathless

scrub away scrub away scrub away
nighttimes past still at last love

but I heard from my man she was romantically involved
stereotyped because the color of my fucking skin
amp those who were left (as) orphans will always wonder why
the fact that my sister doesn-t talk to me anymore
all because you were too fucking selfish to get outside help
from where you are
Will the stars in the sky tonight

on the flight with the pain of the eternity
i feel anger

thats all she has protecting her from pain
theres nothing you can do
i straight manifest I be catching the vibe
ay yo I keep it butter while youre artificial flavor
their molecular cries
you don-t have to turn something in
about you oh

come fly with me to meet the maker
follow me around the world
came back and told me mr brown you young sorry ass bitch
hell be happy to appoint my
pew Pew the game (is) my property so Im telling
but don-t pray hustlers prayer I pray

and if you try to express your individuality
questions questions everywhere but not the ones I pose
for what ails me
and discuss your worth
though the buzz believe in they can open up
im glad that we share
and watch them fly
you are nothing
you think you made me
your face deceives me
because you just can-t face the truth
up through the alley take the door under the stairs
for a while for a while for a while for a little while
every day you struggle through
the slums have to be painted right away
warrior in woolworths
weapons rule their livesDips on friday nights
if you will stay with me
darling youll see
keep pulling me –  keep keep pulling me
now every day it feels the same
uh all right

i fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless
any day now I could be next
but at times the worst seems to get the better of me
its like that
and given a less than twenty percent chance of (livin-)
and the mannequins eyes
with a smile on your face
and they say
80 million hits and playing too
eatin scrambled eggs and toast
jock me knock me but that kind of stuff don-t stop me
pick up the 38 and dirty it with mugging and then
and I ain-t tripping im just dipping in the fishes for my putty back
these eyes have turned to black
make head of all the costs
and people like me wanna believe
whyed you have to go and lock me out while I let you in
i remain only placid
i must save you from my confession
it tracks my veins (as) it lets me out again
crawling with the things Im seeing
im a pressure cooker Im about to blow
my point of view (is) expanding everyday
explosions of rhythmic patterns and intone
soaring in a plane that (is) landing in Palm Beach
ill show you how its done
they show afterhours when you are alone
floating in the blue
how sweet to be a cloud
through a dark club in San Jose
with some brotherly love
i watch (as) the world spins
another day goes by
take a Tylenol to relax this hangover
flashy jewels and the most expensive cars
dyin to make this change
party super hard

of sirens in the not so distant past and then they stopped and shouted lets

every morning I bite a Kit-Kat so I make sure I even shit bars
but shout out Section better winners over my section

praying for someone to put you down like a pound dog
when I felt your gravity
and even if the clock strikes one two
yet theres still this appeal
all my failings exposed
promise land vision 3rd eye wisdom
the power of the people eloquently stated

so next time you find yourself chewing while writing
yo these voices scream in my head keep getting louder
im letting go without taking any part of
savoring my solitude
throw the ancient (Yule-tide) carol
Don we now our gay apparel
no Reggie Miller we be blowing super strong
laced blunts three boy Im still smoking
deep in the ocean dead and cast away
im waiting for the call the hand on the chest
to open up the gate
im feeling like its time to tear
convey the reason you been feeling so down
have you ever had a problem you had to keep to yourself
after She soon choose me Ill Take a toke
take my dip to the motel Do things that make you raise your eyebrows
well find our way back to the start oh
staring down an endless avenue
im waiting for you to look my way
things will come together like it should be
all my Road Warriors fighting the system
please don-t lower
this (is) the line Ive drawn
this (is) your last chance
when youve got your back against the wall
you can call my number
feeling like the Verve
thats how I stay ahead of myself
death defying abominable
poison within your septic
i hear your voice start breaking in fear
and then its taken away
since we were 15
on my parents porch that night
oh but what can I do about it
to see if you had got some marriage
yes we must find a way
to conduct your energy
come come come come inside
just like a fantasy your hear along with me
from cliche rappers dependin on lyrical repetition
nobody Nobody Nobody
bully for you chased them all the way through his charming heated house
theres no accolade
baby we got all of the lights down low Let it snow
new York City at this time of year never felt so hard to breathe
look at me now a man Who won-t let himself be
sand rains down and here I sit
i might look the same but Im not who I used to be
the clocks still chimes the world still turns
write a score Im self employed youre null and void
grind living forever Im Martin Ghandi and Malcolm
no one can save you
where have those selfish choices got you now
girl what do you say
kick your shoes off kick em off
man ain-t gonna stop till they clear out the room (pure-pure) darkness
everybody knows my name if not shame
too much potatoes going on
just fuzzy raisin life said so
and I hope you find a smile on your face
this (is) just random pointless song instead
face yourself to take these miles away
overcome
face into the sun
the creatures walk around me and I see
if youve got the right contacts
used to be mine
such a heavy load upon your shoulders
i finally found you
climbing to the top
i am the one whose wrong
i got plans to execute and things I must supply
now back to my fans
beyond my means to turn my thoughts around
brighter than all the stars combined
ill be the only song youll ever know
ill play you like an instrument
i blunder with the words smother all of her
im not a misogynist Im not angry at all women
and when that don-t work I drink some more
instead we got gangsters with peach fuzz
just lemme know
i hold her close and tell her how much I love her
i see the money on the floor and his gun there by the door
when Im climbing up the stairs
im the new Salvador Dali
spread the word to create something and have the right aim
through the interference
im ready to believe
ive kissed a whole lot of lips
ive seen a lot of towns
i stepped into I stepped into a new world
a towers of glass reflected your coming
to find another way
to see youre not that kind
that Ive worked so hard to accomplish because I rose up through the darkness
im on the latter to another level and damn right I was born to climb
i want to edit metadata
unfortunately we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at
cheat her with my uzi she was stuck like Chuck
hahaha I guess my gat was to long an Blacke you
hate the sound of the closing door
raindrops taste like tears without the pain
everyone Ive ever known
Will you know me when Im down on wounded knee
we Pull Up And Make Em Ride Out
my Crew Malicious Everything We Do Is Vicious
but man don-t get it twisted
met a guy named Bjorn Make a status
then Ill pray the world my soul to take
suddenly it hits me that theres something out there for us
when youre living on the wire
what will you do when its right up on you
i love you
(is) that so
don-t be pissed at them they can-t resist the chick
i can see you deeply need me to lead your dreams free
youre my world
every place Ive been through
so heres to progress heres to the rest of our lives
a worthless legacy a tryrants trust torn down
that all the riches the world had to offer me
it was a beautiful letdown
like this
break down
to change you I don-t need to change the fucking world
i can say that I heard you loud and clear
winter came you went farther south parting from loves nest leaving me in doubt
wants to be a superwomen and try to bust a board around but does she really
and never crossed the path of care
because there (is) no darkness
remember all those trends you set
alcohol drugs and rock n roll
but you don-t have to paint it red
blowing by the wind
and Lord I can-t make any changes
well you can take a boy out of ol Dixieland
and Im just weary to my bones
you know that I need you
always always
this (is) your heart
but its where I like to show my face
theres nudes and its all free
embrace
back to you
when the summer came you were not around
very well wish that you knew me too
i hear you gettin punked fuckin with them outsidaz
(as) Im bout to blow up
chit chat (is) inrelevent on facts so Im tellin
indo beaches in my crib glass bullet proof hummer
playin halo 4
he likes suckin on Goose dick
if a cop ever walks in and busts the stripper sittin on my lap

bounce back if you want I put my rhymes on trampolines
until we seek until we find Ammonia Avenue
and who are we to criticize or scorn the things that they do

for your face (is) facing the pavement and labour (is) a game paid a wage the
i roll the dro thats in the jar then I puff

youre a wild imagination
hold up pause cause you girl keep sending me

hole in the black soul in the storm
man on the bus

from a walk along the highline

about your world your summer world
ill off you QUICK (as) the black dude in a horror flick
when I go off like a shot from a sawed off this was the cocked warning sort
a thousand years ago
here (is) only waiting for a day that went before
enough flow in his rhythms memorize to lock jaws tight
now its time to set the bait like a bow and arrow
trippin over the same bad dreams
i can-t believe youre all mine
luckily Chuck D and Flava flav told me early on
not to believe the hype
if youre pickin up what Im Puttin down
makes you wanna drink don-t it
who gone be there when the shots go to popping off
its grind the cash run it fast

come into my life again
before you get smacked the fuck up

theres something in the water
oh the blinding light
wake up wake up
so get to moving cause tonight (is) my night
butt a ain-t coming down
blessed
i remember bringing some of my lyrics over to your crib
for the sake of future children
breeding perfect killing machines
i don-t understand
all real beauties
he brought you black and white roses from the unknown shores exotique
to the solar twins hovering overhead
to fuck my hope its been this way since
heavy burdens have known me for a long time
one touch and Im feeling tipsy
ain-t even drinkin but Im buzzing baby
i seen mothers cry I seen babies die
its two sides to a coin don-t make us switch
meaningless and forgettable
enjoy the silence
heres something to pop inside your Walkman and cruise to
its either sink or swim and the average drown
a three Ill stick with twos
i don-t wanna make a steal unless you make a pass
yet some await that dawn
so be the voice of death to haunt me
everybody held their breath the moment you walked through that door
made everyone think that Im alright
look what snoop did
but whem my number
so I live life in a different dimension
this ya shit you own this
ugh what happened man All I remember (is) that
(as) I hand over my last gram
you use it for guidance and to prove shit (is) truly true shit
lyrics
running down running down
and has been set forth
i hang with drug dealers gorillas and killers
i know that my bullets gone hit you
sister-s down by the fire
sister-s got a boyfriend
every time you move to the beat
oh woah
lay three red roses on my grave
when we met on a cold winter-s night
i can do it acapella I don-t need no beat
f M J full metal jacket Wooh Da Kid don-t play
sickly and ungracious you turn to dirt
hidden by a bank machine
deadlier than Darth Maul heavier than the Death Star
family bond thats even deeper than blood
of some concious subconcious abode
i go brick church buildin when Im sleepin
you pull my strings to watch me spin
you must have another to dictate to
trying to maintain while the rich weight game
now he gotta pay run away to go out
push me down now from your throne
pick and pull apart my limbs
earnest prayers and heartfelt tears on the field that night They graced our
and just like him live for what lasts to become the man he saw you to be
and I would be better off
and end it for the night
d He a savage
fuc em Let dm have it
and I can see nothing-s how its meant to be
its clear to see my life goes on
push it pull it
push pull
i been rhymin trynna find a dotted that I can sign
now we at Willy Woo
ill plan him a funeral Ill read his last rites
caught between the lies youve been fed
lyrical flows like WHAT
cause scared don-t win money NOW DROP IT
from now on our troubles will be out of sight
faithful friends who are dear to us
now look at us I heard you biting dust
i come through finessing shit he mad that I finessed his bitch
there coming only alive
under the new sun now
i don-t know what to do
get em turning
all creation has the promise of heaven
against all wisdom you heed no warning
im Alabama bound
just leave a dime for beer
to share the pain to be there when the sea turns gray
that I could hope for
coming out the stereos round my town
snap snap papping away They might chase us
he can-t help it
its time for their revenge
ive grown up Im still the hottest kid around
a beast on a pack still Im holding the blame
are my theme songs
still won-t chair
a song of you
just an old sweet song
cool the engines
im no fool
youve made my body brown and smooth
youve made a dreamer out of me
demonstrate respect
identity script since birth
evacuating all my hunger and thirst
(is) there anybody out there So beautifully honest atomic
let Me Get Back to This Shit Ay
im Stuck On This Roof
but all attempts end pathetic
you should try to widen optics
away away to our land
and bleeding fields were covered with sins
im gonna slash and gash and rip another hole in your ass
consent
were gon na break the mold and shake the whole thing So surely theyll fall
sweatshop coming through so everybody move over No sir don-t worry at all
i am just a ghost I am just a thought
i am just reality
we gettin throwed we gettin throwed
sorry I was late I had
hey can you make the flowers bloom or sing
or paint the blades of grass the perfect shade of green
every place where love hate greed belief
it feels like falling down now
ill be the one
beware
already gets off on the wrong foot from the start
when the lines get blurred between love and war
whoa
but its really hard while Im gettin all of this ass
every day in the week Im in a different city
listen to this baby
and come to think about it I didn-t even catch her name
i think Im in love
while Im taking daily trips to the Colonic
then had the doc cleanse me just so you can have them back
were unstoppable
were coming out of the ozone
you get extremely
dont provoke and getcha team smoke
this street honey (is) a mean street
but theres a heartbeat pulse that keep in
she slept through the whole night
let me test you Remember me If not
are you ready for that murda
temp rup it up like psychopaths you wannabe just give it up

and make him think youre feeling him
and smile

cause suckers I can do him for free
got balls big (as) jaws
gotta earn em stripes like a zebra

your dad told me he has no feelings
little boy can I ever love you enough
to be impossible
tryna speak a message if you only you would listen
damn I got the grease with the John Travolta moves
John Travolta grease
god Save our gracious King
hood rats chavs thieves police
high sheriff bout to led the parade

and still these bones will cry
and go br ε k ε k ε k ε
them say dem do am them never do it like this
with no labels and no agent but they know me in your city

cause and effect when the hell the sun come up
and not have outbreak God dammit thats truth

she said
break
and Ive got all the time it seems
don-t do so much
the simple way
oh lord Im so depressed
i was born during the hard depression days
last year I gazed at the fire
but listen to me for one moment
sharing needles with a lepor liking Im living forever
im riddled with diseases just from everytime she sucks it
stench of death reaches the sky
in the name of their bastard son
but that chopper stay in the trunk like a Keebler elf
and cuz caught a ocho they got him for a bomb of reefer
id be lost without you in my
im never home Im always broke
the love can-t be heard above
just tastes like
doing this for my last name never promised tomorrow
but in the meantime you have the right to remain silent
me and niggas got no religion
my thoughts stay cynical
rolling faster all the while
out of sight out of time
baby love why you lookin so sad
if youre sophisticated baby put ya hands up
turtles in the rivers alligators in the swamp
a Louisiana mama keeps a man on the jump
if words alone sound cheap
i could be happy
every single Sunday church bells wake me up
youll stop progress if it contradicts what youre told to believe
where we can we find hope Where can we find hope
life shouldn-t be this hard not a reminder of
the reflection in the mirror the hate (is) deep
and hes got the cheek to portray us (as) the villain
got this feeling inside
i want you to know
but the way to get fans (is) to use that shit
started off this week real bad
make your pussy look like a damn gasping fish
im straight but I know how to boast in my faggotness
angel we have heard on high
in excellsis deo
im a healing scar I have a heart
finding out this isn-t you I went 10 0 miles in another-s shoes
i used to kick it with Lucifer
i used to be a lover now Im a hater
so carry on and make it right
carry on better stay on your way
on the floor in the backseat

love it (is) enough
from Rome to Spain Berlin L A

we sang just skipping through the words that we didn-t know
and the DJ got it right
some are born to greatness
for a precious few their lives are humble
when you get up in the morning and the light (is) hurt your head
rhinestone shades or cheap sunglasses
i lit you a candle in every cathedral across Europe
and I know how they blamed me
it feels so good to be with you
by the old stump row
your friends hating on me
now I hope you thats mine girl
do you love me or love me chasing you around
if I was a sunset that you haven-t seen yet
the truth hurts

reminiscing on the days we survived off nine to five jobs
when u come from broke niggas learn to fix shit quicker
i know you been lookin for me
but I can-t get an ocean thats deep enough for my day
in the name of something true
under the seat with my last name
on the cover of it should have opened it more
and you can-t wait to see me walking towards your fate
you don-t make me into something
im an outlaw
im a dirty dog
that chopper go la la la la
homie just got hit up by a fucking rifle
to be something unusual
oh oh oh oh
last quarter I was the one
all through ya body like a Twelve gauge shoddy in the hood bumping
gotta know I ain-t nothing like other niqqas
watch resold cream
it took an hour or so to reach the border (as) planned
they never seemed to mind for me
then take a look inside my book of recipes
slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese
i erupt so violently on tracks
whatever I do to animals best believe I do to humans
but back to the subject hanging like a mullet

but every time Im with you that phone stay in your face

she was four months pregnant and the baby wasn-t even his
i don-t like Sam I am

just be who you are and keep trust in yourself Do not turn yourself into
something or someone Think about what will happen but do not just think about
this (is) humanity
were always fighting for being superior
and since I get another chance Im working over time
turn another page and never press rewind
some say in ice
i think I know enough of hate to say that
every word but we will never change it
all the things I feel
forced into death Make them work if theyre able
remember those whose lives were lost
why don-t you get lost
doing anything you choose
this hurt (is) kind of wild because everywhere I go I see you
swear you placed cuffs of me and you just tryna fuck with me
take a loss topping lids
chedda chedda chedda chedda cheese
hide what remains
alas muffled cries resemble
cause you ll never understand
come on hold me tight
at times I can be quite difficult Ill bow to no man-s word
not needing to clutch for power
immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
the live wire (is) dead left quiet (as) kept
she took my heart
ten years ago I fell in love with an Irish girl
i know you want me to forget
i know you want me to forget
hey Johnny now Ive got here or what else to see
and now that Im home carry me here
when I was six months pregnant still beatin on me
and the only thing standin in the way (is) you bitch
its Game Over It-s Game Over
if you got bumped for a benz or a O
i thought about killing myself but knew better
guess hell must-ve froze
the nails and hammer they did meet
blistered feet bloodied alone
from a loyal hound
sip on blood

right in the darkness to spy up on you
a vocalist for the consumers commuters and motorists
not to follow (is) my motto

no War No Hatred
greedy politicians supporting dictatorships subverting democracy worldwide

surrender to the writings of the incredible
brain or Braun My brain (is) Braun

moving uphill pursued by a bus
of tiny firecrackers
cold iron hands clap

amazing Grace how sweet the sound
(t-was) Grace that taught
and that your healing isn-t just a case of double contact Lens
so I can Meka Leka Hiney Ho all of your pain away
but laying talents to waste I know the word
yet want you grooving when the song comes on
where and when why I had to go
you never loved me anyway
its why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
i think my generation (is) growing up complaining
don-t know any other person more suited for this
been holding shit down heavy
slamming through
take back what I paid
turn up that radio
all night parties and loud guitars
and let my soul fly
let it go
because Im down with the true crew
peace
im going through withdrawals
you were that first sweet taste of Mary Jane
headed down to Sixth Street to hear some great unknown again
spread my wings and just let go
its like Im running in circles everyday
fall back better retreat bitch
i need to get out and get something no time for snoozing
its just a matter of choice whether you fear it or not
cause it all falls down
and you never let it go
theres only one way through it
so tell me where youve been and Ill show you where youre going
left hand prints in the closet
up in your window
ain-t it a damn shame music today
aim high and shoot far below my goals
21 degrees will keep you clean
sticks and stones from lace and leather
moods that take me and erase me
its time that you won
once one now shattered
this truth One truth
and the stars glow perfectly bright
far along on the Milky Way
cause gang (bangin-) dope (slangin-) bad for the head
been that way for a long time man
comptemplate my life (as) I drift along the shore
life (is) full of discoveries
when success (is) equated with excess
i wanna live and die for bigger things
oh God oh no God have mercy
god
and through my sleeping
words with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it
man I don-t know why though I believe I can fly though
when you are a teen everybody has that one damn dream
we call whores
she a red bone like snooki
i know its not a game
look what you did to me
do you really want to give it all up
if I never see her again
materialistic gold I be wearing be shining all over the place I walk on green
green got to many faces its hard to read these bills star ice on my neck and
youd find a way around
safer (is) ignorance
weve broken the sword of salvation
see the light of oppression
ive seen whos done it worse so I know no one can do it better
damn this chick she (is) so special hmmm
but she mean nothing so other than my dick I feel nothing
i don-t even have the energy to pray to the Lord
getting jaded
even in just you wait and see
pants I Watch The Junkies Comin
yea Lil Bitch She Thick No Tummy
i am broken like an arrow
that their time has just begone
im the realest Akeed that ever wet these blocks
head boss you scavenge off what Deck toss
tongue Twister Crew
thank you to my brothers and sisters Jarrett Dakota Ranjeni Rageni Dawson
trying to make movies or shows
im a major and minor no Louie attire
i got a song stuck in my head
everybody here would say hell no
and seeing you lying there
my whole outlook on love would change
you try to go up you try to go down you turn around
we all share our home on the moon we
cause Im
searching this matrix
END OF EPOCH
