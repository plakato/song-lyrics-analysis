well the children laugh
waiting on a train
i ran the dishwasher this morning
you held me together
fall again you will what they foreknw
i will always savour you

Twood

eyes are blown
thats when I got stomped like a cattle stampede
had a nervous breakdown all my friends and family left me
cause in the city where Im from
get from underneath my brand and let your ass expire
their ambition modest
for a precious few their lives are humble
brighter than all the stars combined
in my darkest hour the comfort Id feel
these young dreams are all we breathe
that our fears just of the doubt
i mean the thought of you and I together
my coming situation im basing all my love
ive found my home lives at the Rivers Edge
ill defend my Kingdom
just so I could play ya
but there (is) more to what I have to say
hold on its almost over
from where you are
who am I Who am I when I don-t know myself
who am I Who am I Invisible
but no one makes me feel the way you do
when Im with you
and make the congregation rock
im gonna let it shine
sharks in the trap house snakes in the yard
holy moly choppa running with the rifle
my wheels spinnin my grill grittin I been sittin

inhale too much have a choke fit
every day I smoke trees up
down by the river side
shopping in sharp shoes

get caught in the intersection
driving in my car damn near cut me off now youre in the fastlane so
it comes the other once again
ooh when I was giving you the seal

the reason why Im rapping this emotionless
if you ain-t unholy drop dead like Freddie

confine your thoughts inside
crow Jane quit me and I just can-t cope
but all I know (is) that Ill still run
your baby mama in the club you mad
let me find out you out here stunting like you got it
its a gang mentality
i refuse to spend life on my knees
could we be better off with someone else just wrapped around us tonight
should we call it quits

or be it wrong
every time you sleep please remember me

the stars lit up the sky
holding hands sharing stories sharing thoughts
streets of safari so ima show em what a lion do
every time I hop the beat its recognizable
but I feel no fear
given up on hope
after that Ill knock it on the head
i live in deep freeze but I thawed out for you
the rules

were going down were going down
moulten lava sulphur vapours

under the clouds

i don-t want to stand still 2x
self absorption
by asserting the self
for nothing No bluffing

in the yellow lights of the city wasted (as) bodies
were surrounded
converge in with a crash
you said I came to you in a heavy dream
i can-t wait though its fine
but he can-t stop now
outside its so cold and I don-t want to let it go
soft and sweet her cheeks turn red in a blush from your smile
the only cosmonaut
could you possibly afford the time
down the hall
if your soul love the sun money rock on
and some of the shit I say (is) because of the speed
you should know by now I do much more than rock the boat
won-t stop till everybody knows the name
all we gotta do (is) right a song
and leave this world behind
feel the energy deep inside your system
who are these youts who are these brares
unwrap that box smoke am on the bus that parcel
could share your name
maybe youd complete

heaven bound
with your (ten-thousand) eyes watch me pixelate
cv dazzle (is) a way of life
all dead all dead
and gone
she makes it seem so personal when I know she-s screwing my gang
i said Baby I don-t want anyone but you
i unload with Nickel-s flow but refill with bullets to sink your chest in
make it lyrical clever a hot beat and move on
mysterious island part of all yarn
where hell and all evil will reign
the weight comes crashing down on on our shoulders like giants standing over
pick through my brain I can-t find a memory of when we weren-t happy
got yourself together trying to move to a higher ground
ill be finding my way
rivers of poison that surround us
i see it now like a reflection in my past
when youre gone what kind of song are they gonna sing
that the rust was gonna tear your engine down
at 3 AM I sleep again
oh my Lord
nothing has changed
i steady my hands inside of my shell
you are officially down
that keeps you from being a corpse that the corridor seals
break their bodies for their bread
beauty torn so tastelessly
brother the difference between you and I (is) that Ive worked skin to bone for
i wish I could buy love all I can afford (is) lust
beautiful heavenly light
on the horizon we saw a new sun
pray that we make it to twenty one
this story
and ima try be with for infinity
i just wanna know you better
i love rubbing lube all over my dick (as) I enter her vaginal
ain-t really in love
you don-t know what you like
well hanging out on muscle relaxants
i see the sun
wrapped around the strands of red hair
yeah yeah yeah yeah
the dance where the peppermint twist (is) neat
you got one kind of trouble its the one thats on your back
take note theres still a hole in your heart
who learned how to lie
i walk across the room to show the two of them how cool I am
im the son of a big time dreamer
if I had to wait
oh its like you come alive when you hear the voice
ain-t no man like the one Ive got
moving past the speed of sound
no hiding from the Hell that I make
diamonds down to sand
theres a snake coming out of the darkness
i wouldn-t stay but if you made me
im gonna go big
just look up to the sky the one were under
im looking up there too
just taking another step Im due to climb
ha Im doctor Frankenstein
regardless all Ive wanted (is) to open my spirit
by handcuffs be bound bail out for pounds from downtown
but I tried to keep the overhead low
ill always love you though New York
i love high school
this goes out to anybody in high school and anybody that remembers them high
and you have broken me all the way now
and some fight you gave
and the world goes away
scrape me off the ceiling
fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away
butterfingers
call up Marvin
so call up Jimi
rolling along Im in a strange state of mind
she was
where (is) yesterday
a thousand years ago

hoping for something good to come from this
when youre forced to take a chance you turn around you turn around
cause we want everything nigga everything
caught him in the back wait no nigga no running
Rick roller stealing baby strollers
hoyden tighter than short wound
cause we both know how this ends
cause we both know what we-lld choose
cold cocked and shaking like a fist
Till we grow around it
the bell that rings inside your mind
its a kind of magic
theyd stop and stare
free to not care ahh
and they told me if I really wanted to make a couple grands
put me on a record I won-t hesitate to smash it
let it ride easy down the road

why dont you listen to this you might like it
make no mistake theres no compromise
head gives to heart
so what starts (is) a blush of mind
to sketch up my best so get up here goes the quick knack
here I gotta an eye socket in my loose pocket
oh lets lie down for another night
your parents they say There-s beautiful things in this old place
lollipop hitch hiking side speaking imitatiors
rock Bounce Break
and Im a good guy but I hang with villans
cause I am a mack
some will say that this (is) not going to last long
like the rest of us trying to make sense of it
cool breeze from such a great ocean
Till it falls apart on you
all you niggas weirder than white kids wearing fitted hats
suicidal thoughts walking though these empty halls
mr Apollo dat nigga everybody wan na follow

scream for all the unsaid unheard prisoners on parade
the lights are much brighter there
where all the lights are bright downtown
they shot my babies but they killed my faith
im all alone on a midnight ride my 16 kids they all have died
because I don-t want my brothers in the can too
im doing me never mind y-all
poisinous tantrest switch to dominatrix

havin a bad fit Bitch Im going bat shit
heart palpitations bumping up through my chest

cannon that shoots buildings
Im alive alone
a piece of dust Lost souls in the wind
candles Im a young Kolonel Sanders
and he told them where that nigga went to school
its Xmas in the hood
it ain-t nothing like Xmas in the ghetto holla back
were earthworms dried on concrete
old enough to be concerned about health
barriers that their kind have faced
warriors ungodly worshipers of cold
im afraid of america
im afraid for the world
swaggin on these niggas gettin all these figures
i don-t give a hoot about shit Im finna the best
breakin every bone in the beat
(z-mainey) onions on my breath make you cry

forever and ever
i keep having nightmares of my dreams
fuck your goals
and then kiss it off hey
now who put the devil in you
cadillac car and blueberry jar
all youll ever got from me
when the pain stops Ill crawl up out of bed
so for the time being Im seeing things a little differently
run aground in cities and towns when
life (is) heart that won-t stop beating
there are scenes that are painted from life
some poor mother at home
you were always there
so unconditionally
and youll never see me no more
because he was lean mean
how ever many times it takes
your heart stops beating every time we touch
i told you all to be patient
but yo pistons just get pissed in
its starting to feel like the more that I climb
plus everyone wants to be stalling the thaw
theyre waiting for something thatll never arrive
with our little boots we built another world
never (is) easy
on a day when I don-t trust myself
have mercy on me
like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
you sound ready to me
i want to be made ready
could create an unknown (life-force)
and guess whos coming next
what can you tell the other one
put all our cards away
there was heat
but the moment we had I felt bad
hearing youve never owned jogging pants
rapplicable Skills keep me staying employed
lets all just put our feet up and kick back
yeah welcome to Dreaming Out Loud
pause
on the (table) I just slaughtered a nigga no question not even talking id be
oh la la la lie
dance if you wanna dance
this (is) making you happy
wanna fall in love till we fall apart
and still do what you like Im out for my type …  a pretty wife that I nick
my style platt and your cushion kind of whack
theyre all paying for bullets to shoot at my feet
does that make you happy
cry no more tears
of the favours you gave me
we followed were it led
one visits enough
the morning after the night before
even though I know that im gonna regret it all tomorrow
who they are who they once were (is) what they fear
falling of a weak empire that stood too long
they wanna vaccinate my fate ain-t got enough dollars
feelin noid cause they never caught who shot 2Pac
and left us burning up
Amy was a fighter
going around spitting my fucking rhymes

prosperity
let me tell you something I just sat here thinking about your comments ill
now id smack ya don-t tell me about a hard day cause you dont even know
but she-s gonna know who you are
a glitch in your cocaine dreams
setting all the prisoners free
telling out the good news
at a party to which I was never invited
i had to look in the dictionary
how bad it feels right now
don-t stop now
the flow the flyest thing that ain-t got wings on it
which means I took ya looks which means I stole ya watch ya out of time
on every other rappers beat
with unlimited ammo you know Im about to go off
im the menace of the mansion
bloodline bloodline your finger print when you touch 9-s
everything (is) round
and away youre so far away
tell me youll see me while youre dreaming dreaming
i don-t like to brag about it
oh oh oh Im really trying
to make it through the night
you try to validate what you do not own
(as) I walk on the train tracks that break if I spark
i hate girlfriends and I hate children
cause I never though that I would be defined by this shit
i wonder if it fucked with their conscience
it fucked with me being out there I couldn-t stand it
do we need to be afraid or hesitate
from the Album In Triumph
i never have I never will
but do we ever ever really know
to raise the debt ceiling temporarily but it would not end the partial

but actually Im in a hazmat and Im haphazardly hacking my way back to

that pain trust that hate love dance in the rain stuff
on the mic

which way will you go
can I get an amen
but it just seemed to walked out with you
ive been tryin not to think about you darling
i Know that I know that I know that I said it
then the night takes over and you are nowhere to be found
in my eyes a waterfall
have you ever had to be the one who sail away
force my hand to draw Ill split the deck just right from under y-all
said if I was rich then I would give a little cheddar
keep pulling me –  keep keep pulling me
keep pulling me –  keep keep pulling me
except for when Im partying and the dream don-t reach the climax

dangling my keys in my old front door
and when those blue snowflakes start falling

forgetting whats important
a constant focal point to cloud and find a haze

and out of love
lover won-t you talk to me about the long red war

feels like Im getting lit
too drunk to drive home
big bearded barbarian till we

Till the end bring me dust not water
i said hey yeah my dawning of day
other little kids yeah yeah we know this shits wrong

from sun up to sun down until we see the moon
bugs Bunny Tom amp Jerry yeah we watch all of them
burnin up and down turning them heads
she-s ready to rock
get up And face me like a man
through jaded cartilage a gaping smile
tight up in egotistical chains
so Id rather be the great unknown for now
and ask why youre here
get out get out get out get out
(is) there a light out off the
each time it starts to melt away
about the way I feel
your side
about a random page
unfortunately we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at
don-t you overlook me
when I am going to sleep
youre beautiful
yeah youre starting a fight
give me some cake this (is) my day never knew the strength of a pray
my girl (is) gone and my homes are high and I just want a piece of the pie
so instead of slit my wrist I sat and wrote this
if this a bad dream than please help me wake up
invest in my penny stocks use them (as) building blocks
so cats of soft consistancy are falling off consistnantly
don-t look back just make sure you leave a trail
cause theres nothing we have that popularity can-t cure and were almost
i spent this year (as) a ghost and Im not sure where home (is) anymore
like were this generation-s Morgan Spurlock
clap twice when she drops to the ground
staying fresh out the store gotta show off the new
this (is) a family
im never giving up
in the beginning I was wrong
in the beginning
but Ill be honest and focused more on eternity
thoughts behind
take a dive
again again again again
gimme the light like Sean Paul smokin like Im on parole
creepin like Im Voldo posted in the corridor
thinking only about you
this (is) love so well survive
oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
the last of the hometown heroes
but you have burned yourself in my mind
good night to the workers on compressed
but hell sometimes love just ain-t enough
and I never thought Id ever be this close to being gone
oh lord (is) it what we really want
theres a fire in my chest
skies that are annihilated by
lay three red roses on my grave
steady posted up in every country ever been
get some more
all of this time I had been wrong
i see a man there on TV
its the pastime Im used to
so I don-t know why
your target-s touch was hot and aim to please
a victim of your touch you stole my soul
i want to be alive
cause the poisons on my lips
a crystal surface underground
if we were just strangers then we would fall in love again
i know when we first started out
well its an old familiar feeling
i can smell Channel mademoiselle on the pillowcase when Im waking up
she-s got the gift that keeps on giving
fuck that nigga and his whole crew
another jealous hatin bitch you a trip
latin America-s hard
i can-t sing no more
never thought Id be in it told em its gonna take time
tryna get up in our posse we got rules like fucking Nazis
all I wanted
a simple thought and reaction Ill tear you apart
still causin trouble but this time its done the right way
just a Lil bad ass yellow boy
the thought of our disintegration (is) killing me
ive got a destination a suggestion for you
anywhere I go cuz I promised my people
i got success on my mind
than just part of your fraction
telling me stop Michael vick
the behemoth (is) waiting at the door
im looking at things that tried to catch your eye
im most in love when shes reckin me
out Attention (is)
with you
always in your arms
the town had been retiring to its quarters (as) if waiting for the earthquake
the lights are out all over town
im on the midnight train
never going back home
flashing those crooked red lips batting those pretty red eyes
your champagne eyes can-t hide what (is) underneath
fuck whoever that assume
and I always say it but its not my slogan
i got buckets like Uncle Drew
this disk (is) no flop read
keep on running away
theres a place in the park we can go
ill be there the rest of tonight forever and all of your life
my inability to socialize (is) breaking in two
brother (is) balanced like the scales of Thoth
verbs of power
my stomach it turns
there (is) something sinister
light up and cast your fears away
standing on the edge of nowhere
every time you need a friend
looking for another girl
oh Lord the way you do
cheating woman going to shoot you
think of you when the miles role along
if there (is) a problem you can hide today
so please don-t pity me you see me holding keys
i bring the bang out bang out
well all I know I can sleep because Im thinking ‘  bout you
and all I know and every day you drive me so crazy crazy
the times that bend the world to you
would you try to let go if I stood in the way
i told you from the start I would never hold you back girl
so long So long
addicted to the stormy sea
the sound of clashing waves
i would have been there
and you were just trying to help me
i wish I take away you problems with a drop
you never thought youd find youre so broken
all
her guilty hands
im the ice cream man this my song when Im ridin through
im the ice cream man she chunky monkey
to the basement room at Richies house
or just a place to call home
whats it gonna take to slow us down to let the silence spin us around
humanity
and I ain-t gonna be treated this way
im (a-going) where the dust storms never blow
its Friday night and hes on his way home
theres alot of this world she-s never seen
the feeling sometimes wishing you were someone else
i know its hard to tell how mixed up you feel
in this world of lies
destiny Destiny
you can put your faith in me
take a look behind the horizon
im awake and youre a half a world away
so don-t be scared I need you
mean mean stride
he knows changes aren-t permanent
lean back in your seat while Im attacking the beat
so don-t act surprised when your mystified
not you just some people that we don-t like much
dance retardedly to R
all you christians
well float with your parade
shout in jump off the stairs at ‘  em
if you ain-t with us you consider this hostile
xannies all on her tongue She just came to have fun
your direction
been on a steady fast food diet
but that doesn-t scare me like it did seven months ago
your harmonium plays a chord
your face (is) down alone on your desk
past twenty
you ain-t gotta worry bout a phone they gave a man life off a rap video
you taste so sweet you like my meat ah
the desire
this shit (is) not a muthafuckin game
i just pulled off the lot
cause these real niggas all we want (is) money amp vow to never let nothing
underground king
its gonna be a Christmas to remember
well wake up to a world of white
sufferin one to the dome my composure
for niggas that run up or wanna get diesel
he finds no strength to get off this ground
no not one
you solved it
heart (is) said you boy
hey there girl with the broken eyes ain-t my love been true
soon (is) gonna come back home
its been a lot to change
you gotta show the world that something good can work
you won-t find me
growing up in the city of orphans
you suck at life so I guess you gonn blow it
and oooh come and sample this exotic darlin ooh
and I may go
cause were always fast asleep
let me be your Beethoven
it feels like whisky and butterflies
and youre the crier in my mind youre so and I can fly
the words are silent and I can see you then I was gone
the finger that pleases also hushes
good loving brings out the bad in me
its the screwed up shit that sees the movement
but Ive got zero three minus three
9 30 2013
nigeria (as) the students slept killing 40 in the latest massacre blamed on

and just like the river Ive been running ever since
its been too hard living but Im afraid to die

doesn-t matter if its been approved by Murdoch
solidifying power by creating common enemies
i Smoke like I got cataracts
bitch it ain-t no silence
but I don-t wanna scare you away
that I wanna be more than just your friend
how can I question Your might

the lights will come the dark aside
theres a love in my core

when the firestorm blazed feathers dripped down and melted to the ground
tryin to hide
but I think its alright girl
mind detect mind if you great we probably think alike some things better
the keys to peace

doubting angels fall to walk among the living

winter love (is) holding onto your heart
and I would never be the one to hold
what the fuck have we done
look at your Mum she-s having a fit
think back on all the things you used to know
that love was lost just the other day
not concave nah more like its convex
lyrics learn to sew and knit with the hope of
twenty one seconds three goals made in a row
it pays off you won-t win you don-t try first
hip Hop just met a Socrates

so I look to the window and the city below

you said no strings could secure you at the station
consolation for the old wound now forgotten

and walk with big brolic niggas thats protectin they life

bitches loving my steeze

got kush for the pain
anchor themselves with angel dust
if seeing (is) believing then the truth (is) only (as) far (as) the eye can see
a society that needs drugs to get themselves goin
this (is) the end this (is) the end
cause youre heading south for the border
were drifting with the wind to unknown shores
any risky venture-s daily in our trade
thats enough of even trying
he said its alright
hardest demonic flowers
atomic artist

when the sun shines bright on every stane
and marriage (is) when we admit
choosing Saturdays in Summer
ooh mistakes in the game of romance
come back my love don-t stay away
she had the brightest eyes Id ever seen
she laughed and said I bet you think youre really smooth
shuffled his feet on the street in L A
with your hair pulled back and a dress
his wife in Tennesse

hoping that my vocals can one day get my stacks right

the trees the leaves the late nights
holding onto something whether it be a postcard or a purpose
fire-s gonna burn you back to me
the body-s been stopped
i haven-t been myself since when
she-s so out of my mind totally erased
an animal like horses or mustang gun bang

tomorrow-s gonna be
well caress and keep you blessed
i met you once when the sun came up
hold me tight trough the night
(as) she-s always done this before

in the year of 39 came a ship in from the blue
hey can you count the stars up in the sky

to leave this world behind

manhood and my past life

she rode a nigga dick sucked the shells of a pump
won-t call no copper If she gets beat up by her poppa It ain-t nobodys
there ain-t nothing I can do or nothing I can say Some folks will criticize
just to see her smile again
away away to our land

reprisal (is) the magic word
how does it feel to have yearned
standing on the edge of nowhere
afraid to change the song

watch me skate away
teardrops falling like money
now that youre gone its been a long lonely time
so good at being in trouble
we have been waiting for you anticipating you
seconds to minutes to hours to days
but I know Im better this way
to find another soul that wasn-t empty
and these beats are like breakfast eggs grits and a biscuit
have bars I hope cuz Illie he got bars and bars of soap
it was too late the die had been cast
and like wildfire it spread
for all my bosses who thought I always faked it
but to realize the bigger picture sometimes you just gotta step back
young but still getting older
now I am twenty one
baby well why you treat me so bad I can-t stand it anymore
you know it ended up bleed out December I never forget no I never forget
i get so much more from this than you

and teach never preach of false freedom
what we dream its all that matters

four years later we stuck in the same drama
education to a thug (is) well debated
all the time all the time all the time all the time
i see him all the time every minute every hour
this heart

our love will keep on climbing
this thang (is) real
satellite phones TVs in every home

a chance to even up the score
and I didn-t understand

Will be the same dude speaking like Calvin Butt
long hair diamonds red bottoms on her shoes
sitting home gon leave you lonely for the night
that we share me and you
just one touch (is) all I need
and its the devil
the door it knocks

im cloaked in disguise
hate me so I can forgive myself
now I am crying
but the flow gets a reaction huh
i asked the nigga how the fuck he get so dark
and babes and babes and babes and babes and babes
let your feelings lift boy but never your mask boy
helpless souls
ready throughout times
in order to put myself in it
and I know you need to see
patience (is) a virtue baby
the reservation for that dinner
i unload with Nickel-s flow but refill with bullets to sink your chest in
thirdly do a concept no one-s thought of before
practice what you fucking preach
from the point of no return
the lights will come the dark aside
neon lights shine through
but I am sad
of course you will
for now I live in a real hell
through your anger and hate I was able to choose my fate
im easy and then well see whos got the secrets
i saw a secret place
no one wants to be your friend
they can-t breathe sometimes
and fuck this battle I dont wanna win Im outty
little you have gone to the private school whats the matter dawg You

the propecies are raining down from the sky
come up and getcha saved up for the train fare money
feels so good your coming home soon
sense fear in your broken breathing
the streets are cold the lights go by
to Calumet Michigan in the copper country
to play the piano so you gotta keep quiet
(as) awareness filled his fame and he examined those who leered
he spent his life a silent sentinel for all to fear
the true American Horror Story
common sense maybe you should invest
wheels get to (turnin-)
i don-t give a fuck all I wanna do (is) learn tricks
i just went ahead and about the pink range sport
cuz boy I know you bought them bricks
fading away from sight and sound
what was the purpose of your destruction
too cool for school gangster cruel

hv Gutter Yeah I go by HV dark shades I can-t see shades dark (as)
once A married bitch a terrorist he call her so much that her phone blow up
everybody want his yoo hoo

the only thing I know for sure
but just because it burns
gotta get up and try and try and try
you got to get your hands dirty when its something that you really need
ive got a saying in my life thats got me by so far
you raise the heights of our dreams and the depths of our graves
and (as) a kid never thought it would end like this
i don-t feel so gay
couple hickeys on your bitch
you know you want to
we ain-t gotta worry ‘  bout gettin dirty
fuck a French girl with my big baguette again
yung yolo
and all the horses floated away
faded in the morning time
faithfully
thinkin bout the time back when I first saw you
throw away rhymes like LeAnns (ex-boyfriend)
bam Do you know who I am
i made a move when it was well out of context
in a candle lit restaurant down by the riverside
two shots in this one cup
smoke an ounce flick an ash
two tears in a bucket
adult friends adults friends
but the world became his plight
and no one can say
close your eyes and then you will be free
how now
i just hope It-S truly love
and the fact that we- 
its our ignorance thats a handicap waiting for a cure
all you need (is) love
so that you can have lots of friends But you can-t take none of that with you
lights and big stages building platforms to be famous having lots of money
you see me on stage
like I was the two timer skeezin or slackin jackin me off
me
crips but they seem so blue
but I don-t need your fear
we are the new face of death
reaching the starlight and silver fields
a million light years away from me
surf-s up big waves all day
at the beach house on the weekend
now don-t you sniff around for something fluffy and light
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
and hes holding on to a fragile old hand
his heart (is) telling him to hang on for dear life
the ice breaks beneath and were falling through
we were trippin down Chalk Farm Road
i be getting all this bread son
i don-t give a hoot I don-t give a damn
im just a hard ass Nigga coming out the projects
sizzle Sizzle Sizzle I stole this from Yeezy
im tripping balls David Beckham
bitch I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
i saw your man was with another woman they were holding hands
i arrived back home a day earlier than I was supposed to
all on my dick I think they should all drink spit
and thats gonna be one hell of an evening
but I play metal and swing a rope
don-t call me brother
who really needs the past
i bend in shapes and ways I never knew
its Sad Boy Sad Boy
we in the mansion now
back before my heart was filled with pain
silence fills my room
she was beautiful once
clinging to hope through a punctured drip
guess the wheels keep turning till you say theyre not
when the world spins out of my control
layin on your bunk countin the cracks in the ceilin
and Im on my only
you can turn to me
ill take you in
maybe youre strong but you don-t stand chance
in the back of your head youll feel the floor again
whats wrong
the sacred halls of Truth
when I get to kickin writtens
the armed forces ridin four dark horses
were gonna do it like

never look back never regret all of the words you said in hope
you get caught in a hurricane
she don-t even know it but my name-s on her lips
ive been downtown too long baby
armor on me especially you need to bring catastrophe
you see rain eroded zahra jewels embedded in my chest piece
if only you and me could cross the blue sea
if I lost it
i wanna live I wanna breathe I want my chin up not down on my knees
cause theres so much more road to pave
and release all beasts to be free from locks and cages
ive got the youth with me usually thats a rare vote
because youre my superman
its only you that makes me better
every time we start to dance I get lost in time
she was so young but she had the experience

and do whatever you feel

and famine feeds the cause for war and peace
where people cheat the populace

water never turns to wine
a vile anal death
ripped from the bone
im ill fitted leaving chills when the pills kick in
its still twisted (as) fuck and y-all gotta deal with it
life turned sucky so they turned yucky bro
and make that flip and save that chip
you are gold
youve yearned for pleasure
mourn till dawn
no one else can give it life
i know it appears that Im so (self-centered)
of nothing like a drought-s sky
superficial showing off for the group thats with you
the lessons written in these rhymes like a blessing in disguise
just make sure you give it back
she a lady in the streets but a freak when its time
to what the ghetto life has done and where it has been
6th grade days
sometimes this side of heaven (is) hell
she came back home today underneath the flag
but Ill have a blue blue blue blue Christmas
thats when those blue memories start calling
so take ya own advice and live ya own life
baby just listen
dancing with the souls that she thought she would never find
why should I care to look into the rear view mirror
tell me I4m losing my patience
i4m not alone I4m just here by myself
sad song sung with good intent lessons learned well from our lament This
made by the ignorant and mistakes made by us all the regrets that led to
hey follow the sails follow the wake follow the blazing stars
seek passage safely through reefs to the harbor mooring the ship in the bay
tell you pretty baby you love to mess me ` round
im gonna bring it on home Bring it on home to you
so they try to find a crack of light
backing off falling
slip out the back door down the gutter run (as) fast (as) I can through the

i am longing for the day you come back for me

siving me a title like a song
the earth to a point of exhaustion
breathless gasping for air for in thy dreams you were there
from the corners of Hollis Ave

cause being me makes me bliss

home of the brave baseball and cold beer
whether your road (is) dirt or paved
and I will sip you like wine
and by the end of the night baby
that you were fine with me
who you are (is) the biggest factor
cause I can-t take none of that through the door
one life to live yeah

pride reduced to humble pie
but theres only me at home
when you say you won-t forget me
you say come back and spend the night
and theres people out there who hate me and everything I say
or perfect Or worth it

so I planted the seed
ooooh that smell
just one more fix Lord might do the trick
to the synthesizer
from a strange factory
and who are we to justify the right in all we do
if we call for the proof and we question the answers
we don-t play like online in C O D

so much so that they can-t even taste
(as) where you end up
where youve been
the sun has finally extinguished
i tear off the serpents head
so cold inside
you talked about yourself
theres no point to just letting go
its a nice tradition
halla sheriffs white cars and police
Judge said if I can-t afford a lawyer
i can-t keep em from shaking
i was just aching for anything
no matter where you look its always lurking there waiting to sting you
instrumental
we chase more cash
i got an extended clip full of hollow tips
5 years old when I learned how to read
proud to be a nerd
structure of society
dead under a sea of waste
with your can of booze
to kick up dust while Im rollin along
and she says
i never knew what love was until I met you
given the chance Ill do you right
what did you think you would do
but you never hear a word I say
you walk right by the invisible man
highway to hell eluding danger
white styrofoam in my palm
borrow you for a minute
just us two its alright
they say you don-t miss your water
what Im really trying to say (is)
see me speeding in the car
ain-t no beating around the bush
but your still with me in my dreams
but all the miles had separate
whispering a holy light
this fog (is) not enough
his eyes will not close
people smile and theyre roaring
fall back
so close
i was in the woods for 10 weeks in tarps not in tents
theres a tractor hop on to feed if you want to see beef
think about it before you speak
on God man I ain-t hit my prime yet
drown our bombs in the sea
damaged supermarks on the (table)
i stay higher than Messiah I ain-t never grounded
i used to give a (half-fuck) now I just laugh
jamie Madrox
and Im buzzed so at the time I just don-t give a fuck
i know our hearts beat out of time
and mostly told you you did the same
someday I will dive me in Someday I will take a spin
i found a god that can teach Take me along once again on
the sirens feed my nightmares
what have I done
sometimes I give myself the creeps
she says its lack of sex
the streets that breathe in our names are shameless places
theyd move like months
but what can I say I was put in a game I didn-t want to play
what can these teachers say about that
while my family selling white
and Im riding by my lone
colder than icicles in the snow
how you like my raw sounds
im the ice cream man this my song when Im ridin through
im the ice cream man she chunky monkey
and don-t be silent
anyway its just the way we behave
its moving
1 2 3 all these moves Im counting
dawn awaits a sleepless English town
here I roam the streets without you
your love
for months at a time
i know it can-t be good for me
the love left at the break of dawn
we don-t know what were doing
lets do it again
well get it right
were never going back the way we came
and your eyes will shine through the glass of my wine
if youd like keep perceiving what lies on my back
let them all make their own music
see how it sings like a sad heart
but I look up and I see Heather-s smile
october 99 I see us in New England in the fall

a young couple celebrating while some mourn
bleeding dying words were few

im sorry Im sorry Im sorry

if You want me swing my way Shawty swing my way

moments lost though time remains
i am so proud of what we were
were all on this ship but were not going to the
metal and steel and live landmines
when you were so caught up
never what you thought it was
wanted to pay attention but more reactions from a freestye
tried to sell out but Id rather watch the weight

wantin needin
oakland raised my birth place

blown by the wind
but you don-t have to paint it red

every race color creed that bangs hip hop abroad
while the rest of the world sleeps in quicksand chrysalis
to howl with the hounds and let your children living underground
the demons ready to kill
i need to thank you when you do
feel the burst it keeps haunting me haunting me haunting me haunting me
two objects collide

an island in the gulf of Darien
port Royal-s spirit lives forever on
poor little girl
ran away for good
or do I phone it in awhile until the feeling goes away
but I don-t want to make this awkward

feeding monsters in the back of his head
welcome to a world of chaos youve been caught in the light
hear no evil don-t you see no evil don-t you lay no evil down on me
its up to you what you do will decide your own fate
your words form hands around my neck and chew up my heart
bury our faces in the ground here she comes here she comes
and then Ill tell the tale and won-t make it up
im diabolical bound to take your mom to school
better grab caterpie
bump My Morning Jacket just long enough to pack it

sorry meet your replacement
it always happens
my dreams would be constantly melting away
id fall to the bottom and Id hide till the end of time
fiends and sexual deviants hiding behind God at their own convenience
the lie (is) no escape lost in the reflections cycle and crying rape
don-t want another heart break love

theres an ocean so deep Im walking on dry land
oh hold on oh hold on x3
all day

and I pray youll be better than me
you should cry for the pain
what the fuck you snitch for when you know the rules
i turned the flame up baking soda ice in the pot
i got the hunger I got the hunger in my veins

brain stew
i miss Alabamy once again
now Watergate does not bother me
bumpy Johnson nigga its not 21 Jump Street
someone hold my bottle while I fire off the bowl
every time that we try to pick our heads up
pick through my brain I can-t find a memory of when we weren-t happy
just a walk through the open country
i will breathe this in
trippin over the same bad dreams
then you showed me youre not for me
we also brought along the Spanish Fly

my uncle preserved for me an old machine
my uncle has a country place
were not just usual
ill stand ready just don-t be confused
celebrating side streets
when all machinery (is) failing
its where I make my stand
your living not just drifting
and Now heres a good simple question
now come along Sonny

i said more distortion

strangers passing by

and ran off along the beach
cause I wanna be the king who fights for his queen
well baby its a new day
to this life that has been

five hundred years of tears we still here
and weve been abused for so long you do the math
get the fuck off my property
time to flip a brick
gem Gang do or die
feel so good then I just sink
feed off my sorrow
i know Ill die for you
for which the sunlight turns dim
keep all the cold things from me
i took it upon myself to go and intervene
next thing you know she-s throwin all her clothes up out the sunroof
you better work
do your thing on the runway
just a sleeper
never never never never
this (is) their theory of a (self-fulfilling) prophecy
and the bribes that they take
they don-t know
even (as) a castaway said
carry light on winds and wander
or paint the blades of grass the perfect shade of green
ain-t it good
living in the real world

so will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me

this tender breeze meant only for the free which youll not be for long
dark passageways never end only glimpses caught between the

in Birmingham they love the governor
we hear motors in the mount
around the city
before we ever ran together
2mex rocks steady over granite

and I wanna Get lost … 
im just a hard ass Nigga coming out the projects
while Yeezys tasting Ray J on his wife-s pussy

moulten lava sulphur vapours

nigeria (as) the students slept killing 40 in the latest massacre blamed on

get housed and keyed by Jeffrey Greene
and when they speak their peace
and Im not trying to win the lottery

spanish amnesia and scorpion boy
careful communication creating a capsule of time

(*) (*) KW (*) (*) I feel good I feel like a human being I feel like a man A man can make mistakes a man can have an opinion a man can be hypocritical But you know I feel like I have blood in my veins That my blood hasn-t been turned cold by the concept of celebrity or missed opportunities or perception

McGuire and Lizzy

that we drank from the serpents vine

holdin on for dear life now all this motion got me sick
livin life like a game who would have thought a King could get cornered by a

money on my mind circling around inside my head

YesSway splendid
and I am left with feelings only just begun
where the planets were not shy
i don-t like this

just to say that Im yours
you played your part in this
i deserve the cross I deserve a death for I am fallen
there for three days bearing my shame
suburbs to the city
hands up for me two times
to catch their first bodies
growing up high school was just like a prison
hey hey everything-ll be alright
cause I love you I love you
i try to fight it but I saw your passion break thru
no matter how hard you trie
and they can-t use our baths to wash all their sins when
i inclined within the sky and I

they was putting you down
the sight of a smell inhale
destroyer Destroyer Destroyer

if you want a love thats easy
and have you seen the moon tonight

plus I drop in sight like Mike Mainieri
you can see a lot in this lifespan
whatever happened to unity
hey you

pink lemonade
and does he kiss you till your lips explode
but of course they repent it cause I coast through the limits
and let the legends grow and become uh
like Abstract and the Dragon Ive began to be bearded
by handcuffs be bound bail out for pounds from downtown
you needa 9 to protect shit
and you ain-t hard why you gotta lie
diamonds they cover my neck and my wrist
thats real (as) it gets thats real (as) it gets thats real (as) it gets
you know I feel ya

underneath the path of destiny
we know theres so much more
on the night you led me
on the rite of god we fell

writin these top a tha dome
we reach for the salt with our arms wet
sharing a meal at a (table) your friends built
and a house ain-t a home

my DOLO chick
you are young
and you want to desire

youre goin back
we eat their bones and wonder why they have no bones left
then we open someone new
we are all alone at heart
fallen on deaf ears
i fall down on my knees
tell me that its all right
walk by a church seeing a sermon in prayer
she-s who I want by my side until the day I die
i will scream that shit out loud
where we are from We are warriors
we gone build not battle
i see-em puttin on that face thats what it take to stay alive
the way that I always can
youre the Euphrates and Im the Tigris
so she pulled me in just to turn me up
you got me where I want you
drop down to my knees and ask you
if youd help me achieve this thing
i don-t understand
super (freakin-) (tweakin-)
all I hear now are my thoughts theyre screaming at me to stop thinking
my hands intertwined like every vein that runs throughout your body
you believed in me and knew I could change
unwillingly out on my own
i never heard of London
soon well have our mansion
you playing on every record give a fuck what you saying
either they threatened They see us stepping our way to the top
cause that might make you a liar bitch
and I ain-t even tryin to waste my energy
feel your heart while the world feels like its falling apart
feel the warmth of the rays of light that shine upon you
dog youre gonna get fuckin busted
i love this woman just (as) much (as) one can
walk in the stage spot spend about 800
i own acres now all this land mines
fears architects of relentless terror
behind the Black Eyes the soulless tormentors
hoping I can see the light open up a deeper sight
that are telling me fuck what the hoes say
crystal clear ice feelin like the snow man
life through ice so excite couldn-t refresh my eyes
and if youre gonna go go with happiness
a gift to me from you
it ´  s aginst th ´  law to walk It ´  s aginst th ´  law to talk
it ´  s aginst th ´  law to sing It ´  s aginst th ´  law to dance
and I don-t even know if im comin home but I tell em …  Im gonna make it
cause we are soldiers and we play the cards we are handed
so please hold on please hold on
please sleep my darling sleep

youll live without what you truly need
you have my sympathy
now take it away
embrace
i wanna go
comes (as) cold then its gone can you help me
the things I know behold me one side of me
these other dudes still up
hands up and that bass drop
when I kiss you gotta kiss to be cool
when I call you gotta pick up the phone
activate my 6 codons everytime I out my coat on
screaming fuck jake
and well be changed by His glory
hell draw us near
no No No No No No

rolling up that hash and the 7 gram blunt
rolling up that sour d
that I promise

sometimes this side of heaven (is) hell
but their world crashed down
flash a smile in their direction
to the top
its a shame that you don-t know me cuz I never
ill never personal foul you
find another but
i don-t need you
here comes the change
like the answer to a question
all villains all winners
drunk chapter member
or by God Himself
its just a matter of choice whether you fear it or not
ya fakers don-t pass though Cliff Pauling
wilt chamberlain swear Im all these bitches want
out the field of Hedon
who (is) this who comes from yon
i gotta have it Im foaming out of the mouth Im rabid
beverly hills mansion party thats where they start sniffing
i tend to focus on the past and not the now
i recognise this decor
i know its hard to see
love can make a way
let me test you Remember me If not
ceilings falling can-t see us crawling out
come crashing through your door
you make everything so clear
if I was a sunset that you haven-t seen yet
if I was a secret could you even keep it
can-t think right
phone numbers your body danceing on the the walls how lovely it looks I love
so there was less reason to hope
the hems of my dresses now
does this mean youll never blow me again
love dissolved in acid rain
i found peace in the places I forgot
my liberties weren-t the freedoms I had sought
everybody (is) searching for someone
waiting for waiting for conviction
nobody else but the kid my parents raised
so now I just recite this shit
well right now right now yeah
right now Im gon na live for right now right now
youre talking to the same nigga who used to be scared of the dark
people looking at me funny never take me for a dummy
i count my thoughts with (coffee-spoons)
i got up and fell right in and
just to make a mark you know to make it stick
thats the realness its all about the ends
its my body odor
watch me get these Benjamins
got the devil around me on angel dust
mazi big bruh
notice how the stars vanish (as) the sun comes up
entirely jewels
black folk blue person red people
for once well do it for a greater cause Each other
all the things I feel
but what about the little things
but I never ever ever seen a bitch like this
im the type of nigga neva gave a fuck
im gunning rappers so I guess that Im a murderer
roll up a blunt now Im flying out
and before you leave drop the top (A-come) on
for all the fellas on the set who claim they have that funk in they trunk
Till we get woozy
yeah she my cutie
so look around
might be the last you get
were picked on then became big dogs then were sicked on
maybe God calls when your friend decides to give a shit
the king on horseback draped
convince Hera to bear a son
with open arms
my child please come home
and got plenty of time hanging on
rosalyn was not off my mind
to hang on for dear life
leavin innocence there on the bank by their clothes
the air feels right inside your chest
assorted portions of of another world
humble he may seem
he threw the past away
bring the bass back
bitch it really ain-t quantum
i go I go I may
im playing games with His love homie Flavor Flav
no I can-t get away
because you re so addicting
i want to edit metadata

baseline baseline weve got fools from the base
that keep swallowing my babies
jehovah (is) my witness
pulled my knife took it to his fathers wife then said hey man Im gonna cut
unrealistic Telling folks who hating to suck my dick next day I go to school
tore it open and what did I see
wheres the dvds
no thats the sound of victory
youre an actor dude
whoa-oh and come over
youre so much better in the night
sickening
brushing eyes
but if I found out you a snake then Imma have to cut you off
my hittas will get you
i love you
just try to say youll
i believe in rock n roll
one music under one god
you ain-t gotta listen to what all these nerds preach bout Right
she said she need to study and she need a quiet place
he could still hear the shots
he slipped through the cracks
it really broke my heart to see you pushin that whip
remeber the first time that you slept over my house
well Ive played with fire but I don-t want to get myself burned
its black and its dark now (is) that how you want it to be
he wants to outclass these
who cares what god (is)
its Game Over Game Over Game Over
i don-t wanna party I came just for cake
6rings for my team
mgs yea we on
you hide from the world outside
at midnight
if your looking for trouble step outside of this bar
if it comes down to fisting mister that ain-t nothing new to me
into the world of heaven
grab the tracks and play just rockin away
halleluhjah the waters screem
king over the flood
oh I know where we can fly
for you
and phrases I bake the best
we all want to have lovers so lets not take credit cards and lets all just
but its hard to realize when youre sky high
youre holding on too long youve gotta let go
how did we get this far how did we get this far everything I hate you are
(blind-sighted) by beauty ill never make the same mistake again
a man holding on to a woman letting go
swimming with a memory that he can-t drown
now that Ive been given the chance this (is) my ransom my list of demands
calling you
he only had himself to blame
he had it (comin-)
then you will ever be offered
you got some hot shit boy
with them witty ass rhymes
pause for applause
to the gypsy caravan
won-t you take me to the
but Remember Jason Terry You Ain-t Gotta Start To Ball
i Get On The Court Grab The Ball And Start Playin- 
playing the trumpets throughout the night Why
everybody wants money
give it all Ive got
nothing-s been the same
let Clifford come over
why the hell it gotta be that way
ill prove them wrong prove them wrong
calm down calm down
can you hear me say Stuart
cause were just kids just kids
ohhhhhhh whoa oh whoa oh
we could be giants
y-all better scream to puncture your lungs now
swing lifted feel
pitter pat to the smell ya later
this one (is) naked lamb
woah I feel really bad for you
and he said … 
cause youre the only one you got to prove it to
so let them wonder
she stay out all night long
like drops of rain
you just kill me could you at least do that
i wanna know your name
xxxx22222xxxxx
attack and jack em fag whack
so talk talk talk
i want to breathe you in like a vapour
with electric lights flashing very fast
that youre different from me
we work hard but the luck hurt (as) a rock
days goes and goes with a puntured relationshit
maybe Im in the black maybe Im on my knees
maybe the streets alight maybe the trees are gone
im a big balla now I know yall niggas sho hate it
all that teasin your boy I ain-t with that there
my group (is) magic and my troops are savage
im in my hoody when I lay in the sheets
hold me love me hold me love me
i love you
my only claim to fame was you
but tonight thats gonna end
im trying to fight the good old fight
its much easier that way
ah
incidental memories collide
her own skin
within the chest
in a few years
never comin down
being like you are
this world (is) just illusion always trying to change you
demons creep tryin to make you holla hide your pride
on the grave sites of my friend that died a time ago
you know what this (is)
popping pills in yemen I got stupid habits
your mouth a lie saying I don-t share
nam saying
to my little one someday
but reaching them and still feeling dead
blackmail
you put it to me and now well play my game
i hate to say this cause my heart goes blind
i hate you but I love you
show me what you know
everybody Rockin everbody rocking
how many shooters this really gonna take
im winning the race Im real in the flesh
she-s well on her way well on her way to kiss the sky
she-s cruel like a clock turning too fast
a lil X boxing Im sorry you can-t play me
they like my nigga what ya waiting on but I been making songs
youre the only one
Hana yangu ino jamba beat
and Ill promise to never leave her side
where those fishing boats with their sails afloats if I could only see
run up to yo head
but thatz gon be a normal thing
abuse your chakra points til your ancestors sleeping
loud sounded thunder gotta try and find the foliage
a typical good time girl
theyd seem like broken glass
using brass knuckles for some hardcore fistin
and when they close their eyes I make red spray
ten years pass
i miss you
history of the future Creating all thats in sight
what time will reveal
in this time give it to me easy
(is) he rich like me
kiss while the mistletoe hangs above
its time for love its not too late
whoops there goes another year
im more impressionable when my cement (is) wet
we gesticulate like apes on mixtapes
we make them reminisce over you Undergods
over think in extensive ways though
its no lie guess Im inspired by the chase
sitting in the office wondering did God forgot me
that Im close to the edge and I feel Im going under
dark was the night cold was the ground
now I bleed Styx into the sea
high velocity suspension like a prophets resurrection but yet
you got ta go that much harder and aim that much farther
recover the damage bring it all home
and life (is) out of sight
oh jump back baby jump back
jump back jump back baby
i roll a fucking blunt while getting dressed if you ain-t know
cop a dutch and roll a dro
and I take you with me every place I stay
never thought Id feel so alone
drink it all down
there was a time when it wasn-t this way
people will cry for a day
the snakes moving through the Garden of Eden
wanna fall in love till we fall apart
but when all that glory dies
close your eyes
when you open them dear
i could never see you cry
if you left me Id follow
lets sing this song together
and play together a couple of times for a few
i know I ain-t the type to buy you a tulip
just don-t say no cause Im feelin (yo-)
so just say what you want and Ill swear that (is) happened
there are some things that Ill never know
a ghost that creeps around
if we were just strangers then we would fall in love again
try fighting a liar (as) opposed to lighting a fire
i think I know enough of hate to say that
and word by word they handed down the light that shines today
are we blind to the truth or a sign to believe in
for you to hold me
are all gone in the end
cause the things you do are causing not to found
what you need to do (is) stop
overcome
fight FOR LOVE
and Ill never hurt again
you say that theres somebody new
thuggin with my ack
shinin till the top
let it happen
you notice what Im wearing
in a tiny shore room a hobby hole if you have a problem with my place you
i hack a saw I pack it raw Im feelin like I just injected some Ritalin with a
but I live by the sea
memories in the nude
gonna tear this biotch up ya hear
got your girl and she chillin on my black cock
nothing good comes easy I believe in this philosophy
i don-t write for sucker nerds Id rather give them quotables
it don-t matter
city kids suburban kids rich kids poor kids messy kids clean kids
you sleep on the street when youre not at home
ok Cherie whats the plan
d O C Pharaoh Monch
fools talk so often Im made to
and you ain-t hitting to it never front like you hard
its especially when Im blowing before court In the morning
this time I can-t help
there (is) nothing I can do
and treat you like my old friend
she-s got a talent that won-t disappear
unless were pushed
you know Ill come around
im on on Facebook bitches commented
your sister
let total combination be your final core
(blastin-) fast and loud
strutting with her head up in the clouds
she-s young she-s just having fun
he had no servants yet they called him Lord and Master
so say bye bye to all your crappy wishes
evil mind my satisfaction a crime
i said hey anywhere I follow
trickle me down I am like water
they rip your soul out of its place
lets go cruisin I wanna go cruisin into wild times
you walked in looking for someone for something to share
slowly dancing cheek to cheek
im standing out your window
lord knows those little nails can be troublesome
these girly trends
im gonna sit and watch it burn
we still have hope that the world (is) going to change
le-le le Let-S start
Al Green Let-S stay together
rocking through the midnight hour

i smoke man in the face with the colt
but on a serious note it provides a safe place
and its a beautiful thing more people should understand
and I would never be the one to hold

windows tinted seats pushed back like a cuticle
like I opened up the floor
once you stick around then thats when Ill show you happiness the world can
see
kneeling down before now familiar flesh of your deformed penis

i knelt down underneath the midway in the millionth sighting
i turned my head to the left and I knew I could not be drugged
nothing happening we just trying to live but nobody wants to die we use to pop
us its time for us to shine if I talk 20 shots to my brain and hands dont see
ooh its just the way that you move honey
superficial I won-t take Ill wait till you sleep
and all its wheels ablaze
Ahab got up on his horse an rode

playing all my cards and Ill be rolling the dice
but I seem to always just lie to me
maybe some mental dieting
not my soul but my body (is) put to death
the sun (is) burning out and with all creation shout
i was searching for equipment so I could fulfill my purpose
then laid eyes on the perfect microphone 6 dollars for layaway it truly lit
you need a cause you want to make a stand
be a part of the big fam white picket fence

listening to my idols talking to me but they aren-t even here
na na na na na na
my mama raised me in the wild
blunt on my lips with my foot on the gas
vans on my feet I don-t fuck with Chuck Taylors

my heart beats one step ahead of my feet

when I see the police I might duck out
while lovers come and go
the roses in her garden fade away
ooh you say were getting there

some are faker than the pictures they feature in
i mean with a body like that youre begging for attention
saying sorrys one of the hardest things for me to do
im always searching for something

beyond my means to turn my thoughts around
it will be so long before I know
the quivering heart of Cory

evergreen make me feel whole again
and youre gone gone
i bought your lies but my heart-s not breaking
when the buzz buzz keeps me coming back
together well make history
we can-t get no closer
out there in the moonlight glow
she-s a bad penny
to sing all her favourite songs
heres a couple things that I did in the recent past b
sent a self constructive message to double X and send it to biggies house
never said die
we took a whole song to say
counting the days until they set you free again
feels so good youre coming home soon
next second you don-t even have a girlfriend no more
im going through changes
its getting warm outside these niggas like to put they earrings in and
polo overalls short set son of Mars though
hopin to be forgiven
the road was empty
he who kills the most (is) the biggest man
no war No war can be one

and a great escape to make your hands warm
come and knock on my door

from 6th grade all the way to Junior year
i swear we were gonna get married my future without her (is) scary
and you cried so long

instead of buy new guns I buy new goons

zendegi ba to kheyli khobe
hala bi to inja dar be dar baroon mibare

where the sky isn-t blue but the culture (is) crisp
a blade which hasn-t killed
whispers chant from the depths of nowhere
Will I ever leave my mind
the light disappears (as) I lay on the ground
and hold everything theyre playing my song
and George at the bar with his fake fangs on
oh my you think your made you got youre first laid
ill fuck you up and wait for a new trial
octopuses
this can-t be right
a twisted little sick-o Im (as) vicious (as) a pitbull
and walk through the fire weve been to heaven and hell
its been a long couple years but I need this too
theres nothing Id rather do than be happy
enjoy the silence
meaningless and forgettable
i don-t feel the need to try and explain
i don-t want you to wonder why
and I know where it went
well I don-t mean change baby
i think Ive been here before I think Ive run into you

because life (is) a test that none of us pass

living young but life ain-t free
and I know and I know
you know the deal Gem Gang so for real
welcome to the million chance of her life
close your eyes and try it once again
just let her die one more time
and honestly isn-t everyone sick of people who think TV (is) reality
of a passion when Im rappin I attack em
measure for Measure I am the best here
kill all of them in front of me
and thats a fact
im so cold
no hell never hold me in his arms again
if I could separate whats real from what Ive been dreaming
the roof blew off the club in Oklahoma City
pulled to the side to provide conversation
treats me like a king every syllable (is) perfect
diamonds
i missed the ark but I could-ve sworn youd wait for me
no more commercial interruptions
damn
seeing hella faces hella faces
make sure that remember that a nightmare (is) just a dream
all the while it makes me smile
(is) it all an evolution
she ride me like a roller coaster
once youre mine
a mean and rotten racist your fall (is) what I foresee
mr Deadhead your soul will rot
thought he was the beast of rapping and it looks like this little motherfucker
i ran after it to see what the hell was going on and then I saw it and I
youre guaranteed to bring an evening of desire
you give me love
girl throw my sash belt
cufflinks gold haha
smoke out the grudges like coke product
every morning I wake see the sunshine no dark XX2

started when we met one night
and I apologize if Im coming off too strong

towers
in a blue sky
she wants him to hold her
thats how love began
with the gilt in your eyes
dreadhead SchoolBoy amp Young D
because of you damned livings
on the funeral of your loved
sneaking through the back just to see us front and center
after every show they be screamin for an encore
ducking the cops Im a speed in my foreign like I am a racer
ive been in the game Im the rap Mike Vick
bitch I get the bread I don-t give a hoot what did you say
do what I want son do what I wanna do
now hes caught a nasty sort of person
Arnold Layne had a strange hobby collecting clothes
against the country thats blessed you
thinking wed all be better of here
youre my everything
open up your heart for me
im ready to start the conquest of spaces
the forces of gravity
but no child of mine will be bearing
never meant to be
then I never looked back since then been gold
im taking shit from my father Never listen Why bother
every night I lay down I can hear
but it just seemed to walked out with you
ill always love you though New York New York New York
still amazed I didn-t lose it on the roof of the place
frowns turn around when Im chilling with my peers
too much fun leads to the tears
seem
they were liars from the start
somebody tell me this (is) all a dream
can-t keep doing this
comin home to my baby child
just (as) blue (as) I could be
too many to count now redemption will come from a body count
but He was busy envisioning the future eulogies of all the students he
the smell of evergreen
close your eyes its almost here
got them in the mail
gotta get their money back
why are you my clarity
if our love-s insanity
everywhere I go I see you and I
assassinated love

no one will recognize me
that keeps us together ow
the landlord-s gone Im down and out

he said he had a bitch who wanna fuck me
oh for the love of you
cause weve gotta come up
earnest prayers and heartfelt tears on the field that night They graced our
after 5 years of fighting this One autumn took on more meaning for us
oh woman have sight
lyrics
yo turn me up some
stop me when Im (leavin-) but watching all the same
have you ever been so used to the dark that youre afraid of light yeah
throw a jab at your relatives Im hitting whoever lives
i showed more desire they got inspired
cuz soon you gonna look up to me like Im crucified
dry your thighs in relief
i see you going down on a fireplug
i told her don-t wait for me cause I keep it moving like a bus
amp you could say that that line (is) cliche
brandy was hanging from a cigarette billboard
well I took it down to the crack side of town
can I keep dread far from your heart enough
a hammer of purple shit
if I was you and you was me I wouldn-t try me
born in the streets of New York without a prayer
i think Ill start a metal band and scream until I throw up
but its cool man ‘  cause I got other stuff to listen to
we were dancing at the disco
its 8 o-clock and Im feeling fine
your parallel thoughts always doublecross mine
friction over the edge now theres no turning back
we struggle to tear ourselves apart in the light
were broken down lovers at the side of the road
don-t bring me back to earth
don-t bring me back
keep the kryptonite in your pocket okay bro
aesop Rock
you decide for the peace of your mind So we cannot think about the situation
bummed we must keep things rolling The sun (is) shining through the waves of
i see the path through limbs and throats determined and aware
on the horizon I see long shadows cast by the sun
stereo radio … 
to hear
i wanna live I don-t wanna die
so I wake up and I pray
oh
cause youre under the blade
when Im on my own I feel so alone
feel so good
can-t lie that I knew a few snakes Van Persie wow
and you best know that Im 100 a red
and I barely noticed
and rolls along
that I was worthy I was worthy
its in my head and I have said
but now I get more looks than when I wear women clothes

all those thoughts I had made it hard for me to breathe
whats happening its mr 825
im tryna get money swear nothing really funny
back to back we smokin thrax
to come and try my crew
like you don-t remember loving me
i was about you from 9 until 9
or so they say in the news today
a toe tag ends the tale of a life insignificant
you made me despise you by crushing my faith in you
now driven away by her flesh and blood
when I see the light
true love forever
i can-t let my family down in shame so Im swinging and Im damaging
juiceman off his ass with a bottle I can-t tell him nothing
only way Ill miss (is) if one of your friends (is) in the way
ive had dreams of getting signed so every time you hear me rhyme
think Im gonna have a son
and if you find she helps your mind buddy take her home
its a strange old state of mind
so bad at being in love
and the sea up underneath get so deep
someday I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
she said Take out the trash

it fucked with me being out there I couldn-t stand it
itd be nothing more than a funny leak man
we get in work (as) soon (as) we get the groove
friends don-t dance and if they don-t dance then theyre no friends of mine
i said (too-rah) (loo-rah) (too-rah) loo-ah ya
we cut all games and church play
before the foundation of creation see God was
now that youre gone
kicking at the door
a black boy from where the black boys die
that grew black wings now watch this black boy fly for real
blah Blah Blah Blah
sorry boy you played yo self cause you keep (sayin-)

instead of sittin in the cell starin at a fuccin wall
hit em in the neck then Im gone
on the last day of her life

time For Spinning Round And Round
this ghost train will derail and crash
you moved my wardrobe out the front door
pyramids witness the funk bearer

but I deeply
to my creative fantasy
cold cocked and shaking like a fist
Till we grow around it
i half believe that I don-t care anymore
i could call this home
make it so we only see your eyes
empty promises that you have made these past few years
Will you confuse my love for the cobwebs
somewhere impossible light still shines
gotta worship You for who You are
cause You give me strength You heal me within
watch the stars disappear
i won-t deny my soul

Skrillex
feeling froggy then leap no no

estless and numb
estate of thoughts consigned
don-t take my words to heart
don-t wash away the stains its who you are
when youre out there doing what youre doing
but just because it burns
cause we all slaves to the same gains
i see it coming but it crashes through the windows
its the moment
i believe in my good times
better when we do it together
we thought we could do it without love
i trap and I trap and I trap
same time I still gotta make p-s so I shot them o-s like fuck what the law

for the day I take your hand
here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
i have to pinch myself to know its real

and if I ever lost you how much would I cry
how deep (is) the ocean
lingering souls dead bodies never found
connected they are by a trance a desolation within
so we packed our things made tracks
i told the gang we weren-t welcome
the warm embrace of a young man that went to fire
through fields you used to run when you were young
born in the gutter
those who don-t have
(is) the only earthly way
have your ticket in your hand
in the clock they sent through a washing machine
when the earth streams in in the morning
just to get some attention from you
where Are you

i miss the days when I knew every single waitress
youve got another one coming and its gonna to be the same

the troubles that we know are hidden under starlight
but when the dawn had come
of the temples of syrinx
fill the hollowed halls
i can see it all
the stars are all that carry me
if I had my druthers Id pen another with precision
we rest our case
all of the faders and all of the lights
freida on the mountain
and most of them doing bids in the cell locked
momma working over time just so we can have the shit
so come on watch me
im going berserk and Im going insane
walkin down the street
some freak from a menagerie
what Would it be like if I had somtime with you tonight
and What would it be like if you was in the world If you was my babe gurl
tryna eat my nigga

i met you once where the river flows
take-em break-em make-em feel it

thinking of the Christian era
this (is) WCET 88 1 FM midnight hour
cross country or something
i done had others in my life that I like

we get loud and we get high
where I took my own life Then what would be the point
cause I can-t keep up and the
now Im getting all of it
with the black Gucci
the smell of death surrounds you
you stick them needles in your arm

i swear I love you to the bone
we can have a motorway with motorway dough
who needs to live in a dirty old town
we going from the time we wake up til well past dark
on the Mardi Gras Boulevard
killed brethren
with a fury to kill
i got ya mom waiting on my dick just to blast off
no cost bro you lost bro
we light up the sky
youre never gonna change
carry them things every single day
nothing they say could really explain it
i want to feel the wind
so I grit my teeth and straighten up my spine
Will be wailing after Im gone
my house has been built but I am alone here
ive walked through valleys of death
im never real
until we take it all the way
slow this rocket down
this (is) a (never-ending) story
pictures without a frame
i woke him up and broke the news
this (is) love so well survive
no mortal man can win this day
queen
and the problems that hes facing theyre all building up inside
same old job and same old dull routine
soon hope would fade and youd fall apart
before our eyes you were destroyed
i can-t go out alone without a chaperone
you may say the streets are safe
we aren-t so different you and I
whole crew (is) graves crouched behind the car
like I could fly
ive always been afraid
who (is) the liar The deceiver
for it (is) you who will die for the bastards sins
equality doesn-t mean we go half and half
but just wait I got something to say on this take
someone else
oh may a whisper can drown them out
weve learned to treasure
into Nirvana
the heat so the hounds on fans-ll work
just get a big hit and youre set to the sickest pawn
breathe it in second hand smoke
growin at a fast pace made my heart race
custom suits to exclusive shoes
just me and my boys settling down with the most beautiful of wives
enough with the verbal attacks I got real skills to make it happen
my teacher told me that my best bet
you better get behind that center and make her snap
serving pate to everybody in the party
the Devil might be at any one of my shows
the oven which I bake with (is) unconventional
ive had my share of heartache and pain
well grow together forever
cause the poisons on my lips
at your finger tips no one-s
bodies on the screen
faces on the corner
lets get love tonight
one day well miss this
down the same old highway
i wish the way that you loved me always stayed the same
i crack an old e to release to keep my mind in one piece
show em what a real soldier does when hes caught behind enemy lines
plus I can-t look my son in the face cah I remember the day
but she never listened
mix Hypnotiq with the Henney I am Hulk
cause I flip it then I skip it like a rope
panicking in my skin again the future-s near I fear
move it prove it prove it you say that you putrid stupid
so you wanna make time for cheating
all my friends say they think Im crazy
man Im smoking purp you can keep the dust
im a real nigga I could never be fake
in my dreams for so long
its so wrong forever
brains brains I won-t lie
bring me her brain
can-t you see us burning down
fortune finds those who wait
its so devious so play decent
i figured it was tough love
if lines

saying that you got it but I never seen that shit
the level of depression in my soul (is) just too high
suddenly you were gone
i feel your presence
single comin

and stop your love games love games

my word (is) bond so just try to try see whats left of you
im always right I don-t think Ive ever been wrong
im gonna let it shine
so open up your heart and let your life free
great pyramids served (as) tomb but power
the facts of the living the phoenix flies
back
fiending like Jodeci just to flow to a Flying Lotus beat
i hate to say this but its just pitiful
how many money bags you rock
heaven heaven
can you feel it
ive givin up just can-t help it
it just might be that all my life Ive been searchin for
i know that I won-t forget you quick
so come back to LA
never showing up at the door
vizions getting clearer like a diamond in the rough
every step met with force and demands
forever (as) stone
took down your pictures and your belongings
we are ghosts in our homes
really royce and we led up shoot the sky down
its a serious condition expose to roll thicker
if I gained the world
youll come and find to realize
and my trees sprout tell Oprah Im the brand new Deepak
a little less alcohol but I still handle these bars
but whos ever truly free but the dime and time
by the hands of love
and I felt myself begin to fall
baby baby babe
of intellect I wreck shit with my own sect
the flows I knows puts the papers in pockets
so Ill spill out under the frozen lights and Ill watch them until Im drunk
hate the thought of being here alone
our system awaits testv Freedom by choice
before the storm
fading away
long after we are gone
somebody must pay
until theres nothing more of me
til I love again yea Im just saying
i know I fucked it up but girl I swear that youre fucking us
a life thats truly immortal
a lord of the unknown
you found me on the beach
i wanna carry on

its better to burn out than lose it all
if this move will be a win
just hangin in here trying to be your
just hangin in here trying to be your
i took the air from your lungs
your hair forms a halo round your head
but a line on the equators only parallel to twelve

different from the rest
blindly supporting you after all you put them through
the one that got me only looking for hoes and emotionless sex
three things that describe me factually
some choice words for all who attacking me
i would say and engrave and pen (as) Id rave and rant to myself
while slaying these hot beats and praying he got bail

hoping Praying Wishing Dreaming of something to save me
and we find you and I in this balance above sea below sky

numbered in each grain of sand
Til the pains of life were gone
in between the cracks they go no one knows that they pulled back sheets and
content content for a moment but only for a moment
head behind the portables
while Im bumpin dick pleaser
where the wild things are that hide from the sun
overstands warfare caught in the cross hair
in the forest
killing all these pussies

the syrenge (is) calling out my name
i am not your hero cause youre not in peril
this ain-t for no acting niggas
creepin in the shadows lookin for the bitch that will be mine
holes

im that flower in cement that keeps on growing
running away
(as) the world turns we all live in the box
if I don-t wanna be with you
pictures in on the wall when we used to smile
never were Her dreams so maniacally cruel
for ravens winged Her nightly flights
waves were rough but that ole ship kept sailing
(as) I step on board I ll be leaving

perfect Day well put it behind us well put it behind us
perfect Day well put it behind us well put it behind us
i believe you never wanted my love
fighting though its so cold
takes my soul away
death covers everything
im bubblicious
if the networks playing but no love for bill Cosby thou so tired of you butt
tryin to keep possession of my sanity
grew up in the streets
and a dosage quite unwise
my bicycle rode so smooth
about a random page
unfortunately we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at
holy black water with sawgrass citrus trees
looks like its time to trim the fat
sink your teeth into the moon tonight
the sun and moon resided in their place
and I could find something else to bring you up
you don-t know what you like
you taste so sweet you like my meat ah
feel my girth and look in wonder
but Ive got a blank space baby and Ill write your name
keeping you second guessing like
how did it get to this
yesterday stretched on for so long
cuz your words dont even come close to the best
but in fact when I was reading this I felt like it was a wast of my time

appetite for personal government and (is) prepared to defend Britain-s actions
italy stands with the Germans she will suffer more terrible havoc than will
life-s a bore

if I lose you
in the final sleep
can-t explain what I don-t know
i ain-t been going nowhere for quite a while
whos gonna take me away
whos gonna save my soul now
my brother he lies to me
darling Im a free child
words hardly dent Harvey Dent already spent
singularity approached him
hangman has done his work destroying their dirty minds
bones to ashes black witches are blown to dust
im chased by the rap police like Bugsy Seagel
unequal its not even legal
ill look in too
and when you walk the streets
one two
spoken
suck my dick till I nut suck my dick till I nut
i don-t bake and go home I just be making them nut cause I
my personal demon (is) linking the shades

Document boundary
some say love it (is) a river that drowns the tender reed
anyone you see
all broken up and bruised
in they automobiles
i was in the front twisted up seeing stars
so you can seek the truth
don-t put me behind bars cause nigga I ain-t guilty
dancing dancing dancing
the rain the rain the rain
on a petrol stained sailboat
i came to break the wall that rose around you
if I feel you again would your heart race like mine
i will await for you
im coming home
reliving this (is) something new

woodentoaster
ive stoked the fire seen more pain than you can know
its there to find
its in your mind dear
take me on
take on me
made a parade of myself in the street outside your house
and sing the songs your mother taught you
hey I have been freaking out
i keep on telling them
are the men who gave up their homes
remember the men that wrote your Bible
they are nothing but false flags
and the silent compliant approval of the powerful
all the sensations
give me some truth
cause I heard it screaming out your name your name
i can-t help myself from looking for you
welcome to the tavern in the grove
where ancient spirits live and rove
after a lifetime of what they think-s just good luck
i fail to see how this (is) an effective system
prostrated on the grave and hope approval lies beneath
knotted like tentacles that stick and take the souvenir of texture
i can tell the way you smile
if I feel that I
for less than gold or any above METAL
that well never find that divine path
make some money hoe make some money bitch
im in the yard diggin graves til she dead
she-s well on her way well on her way to reach the stars
for you are a dove limp on her grass
surrounded by moss and trees Id feel only the dampness
how can I let go of this seemingly impossible
i got weed and im cashed gimme pussy and some ass
bitch give me head what you thinkin bout that
i know where we can fly
this one dream
you got a hundred buddies
but a couple of damn good friends

in a perfect world
satan wouldn-t be caught lookin like that Man thats all Im gonn say
jesus a man known for his moral cleanness
cause their moment-s forever
standing like statues so lucky to see them here
tomorrow
over thinking every little thing
from first step to last
i used to think that I was bound to reverence
a little lower than the angels
thats alright with me
dance with me
one more time to feel alright
for your own survival
ya know that holy rivers don-t end
its true
loving you

theres a slow train coming

waiting outside your home
vanishing just (as) the dawn comes
and of course that Im thinking of her
now Im falling but I won-t touch the ground ooh
when its all been said and done
and youre out there on your own
your image (is) internalized
pictures of you
just let it go another day
they could never believe you anyway
i wish I could go back in time
lady I don-t want to follow
the past well crucify
a new beginning
who seek a piece of heaven reaching for that preacher-s blessin
and plucks my heart into a symphony that won-t give up
its tragic count your blessings when you see them
so pray and let go of weakness and never let it defeat you
she screams loud (as) her subtle words rest deep inside me
nothing could ever stop you nothing would ever stop you
blame the prey
ill keep your secret

bas kon harf nazan
Will never fall upon my ears

wanna be a man but I know my pride will kill me
artificial yes man in your crew makes you official
and this black soul thats oozing from me
we don-t deal in money we deal in time
free your mind
breath it in second hand smoke
everyone was guided towards the truth
and if you got money then I got money
contradiction of thy thoughts standing calm love not lost
i see what you hear
and we know this love has just been sold

after She soon choose me Ill Take a toke
underneath your skin

earth bound by will of the Creator
with the bass of the great war chant
going to court I can-t get enough
real dope boy jugg king
so be careful where you tread my friend hold tight so all your morals will

all of this time I had been wrong
one time my father said to me

dissonant shrieks in your mind fear (is) all around
a path of crushed souls and breaking bones

dab life looking like Cheech and Chong
aye
when I haven-t seen you in so long
i remember the make-up running down your face
cause we choose to stick together while we creep through the mud
together we become a pack of wolves that fucking terrorize
i don-t like who I see
the ice doesn-t freeze here
so got down this spoiling space
its future rust and its future dust
heaven has dropped its gates
chief among ten thousand
its only going up just one thing and another
its been a lot to change
all I see (is) black
nobody wants to be a rose
no time for feeling bummy
if you see them walking on the beach
thats why Ive mastered procrastination
it (is) telling me that I cannot escape
she dancing with her girls getting ratchet in the club
i give her my apologies but she says theres no need
im inspired by a city thats rotting from within
its the Questionmark Asylum your A amp R-s wet dream
honor Glory and Praise
the truest of treasures
t teach you how to flex
alright okay
i had a firecracker waiting to blow
hell I still love you New York
and now I feel so abandoned shattered and broken

i closed my eyes and she slipped away
i begin dreaming
‘  till He got down on his two knees
‘  No wait she said

so let me make it easier
yeah everybody-s gonna be singin like this

dastardly deeds Inglorious
shit That Makes It Hard For A Nigga To View His Own Reflection
thats Cieling Fan Swagg Gang 300 Spartan Squad

drifting and dealing
(as) you die to knees
what got me (feelin-) like Im the world-s Kryptonite
the morning comes
cold and bright (as) I need it
all that remains (is) blood and stone
weve lost this fight
big Narstie said don-t fuck up the base
don-t act like you don-t know
music fish
3 (\) Stayed up with the old folks fell asleep to their stories
grinding from the rainy days until the cleary skies
when I see my crush on campus ionic bond like chemistry
you think you know you don-t know
what hit me when I fell down in silence
my ho was in the vehicle
which means my gangsta bitch was a pranksta
you whisper secrets in my ear
little sister Can-T you find another way
ooh
i never should asked for black leather
you washed your truck and my heart flyed
im stuck here with all my guilt
when time was a question
in the midnight of the soul
weve got better days
nobodys home
youve given me a whole lot to think about
ill take a drive to somewhere I used to go
still in peaceful dreams I see
a song of you
my drinks on empty need another round
the best trip that Ive ever had
a brilliant mind controls you
some things may never change
my nigga the I hit them all and blow a bag
ak spray and split your back and you gon stay that way my G
Ecco2k
all white Dior All I wear (is) Dior
i really had a car when you was peddling through the gears
when we get it back see my brothers have been through hell and back
elevated (sage-like) lovesome and gifted
race around the city and get your whole crew crushed
heaven bound
youve got to be an angel cause you put heaven in my world
im a doctor myself minus the med school
i scream at deaf people thinking they can really hear me
fiending like Jodeci just to flow to a Flying Lotus beat
unorthodocks
saying Aunt Nancy (is) with grandma dancing
aesop Rock
but where are you
i dont know where to go
lay in bed on rainy days
and Ill follow the lights to see you again
small clouds leave mouth
take away all my fun
here I go again
lettin you can-t keep you hear
theyre saying maybe you made us then forgot us
and all I know (is) that I still don-t know a lot
yee ain-t got no damn crib how you think that make her feel
because I pulled thru and killed youu
open up and let them all fall out out
afternoon high
not a rose for Emily
and (as) the years go by
i confess that my train of thought was off track
im busting these shots if Busta could rhyme (is) it nuts to think I
lookin for me
a little bit of faith could be the cure
i can remember I can remember a time of beginning to relate
Caroline tell me where you gonna go tonight
wouldn-t be any easier there was someone else to blame
tell me darling are we fading out of love
summer nights alone in an empty scene
caught in the net of how it ought to be
what were gonna be
ive got this glow
its not easy to let it all go
so don-t let it get you down
my hands are almost clean
youve got nothing to prove but youre going to prove it anyway
how you ask are they up to the task
where your fears and horrors come true
yeah I came this close to being a father
i was bothered by the news
im locking my safe and Im hiding away
get out the studio on this morning
sun (is) rising stings my eyes
the horses floated away
goes past
cos if we make one it will break us
im sick but not from a syphilis filled trick but of this chick
not giving fucks and stuck being idiots
for personal greed and tell them (is) in the country-s needs
of brash thinking on fast ways we can be cash making
think of your best times
all sorrows become void and small
im never going to never going to never going to
hoping not to make it an issue
patience (is) a virtue
of a little destiny
haven-t I the right to make it up girl
but its so hard loving you
talking to the daughter of a famous actor
besides what I hide and besides what I need
take pictures for a living kinda like Peter
probably couldn-t tell by this sick physique but
underneath the cold moon
i am just a hollow man
growing ancient lost within the mine
chained to the factory floor smoke fills our lungs and our world
let me be forever yours
can heal my wounds and make me see
south side of LA (is) full of fucking shit and piss
i guess I really am a jerk but thats how business all works
whispers in my ear and shouts out loud
your voice
smoking weed on a jet hydroplaning
welcome to Oz
there will always be a need for the pieces you are made of
a moment of silence that needs a (poster-boy) for science
white light on my baby alright
raised up like an animal
and the wisdom to know the difference
i cannot change
its never coming back
and our love-s waiting tonight
blazon stone power and hope to the slave
blazon stone we spit into the face of death
its better now that I get these bad ideas I get my dreams
do the resolve do the resolve
i know you want me
i see the best in you when Im next to you
readin out speeches speakin packed with a passion
the hole in one holdin a gun called sound
don-t carry such a terrible thing into eternity
you give a blank stare into that deep sea recite your prayer then fall
breakout gonna bust of this joint
been in this cell block seven years too long
boys who write songs
but honestly I can-t be sure
the Show must go on
whatever happens Ill leave it all to chance
and once my soul leaves my bodily shell
chose by few on the positive road
to fight for what you are
its what were all about
money clothes hoes gets played on every station
(is) they real cause how they act
im moving and shaking these losers
he lost braids
needle cracks and tape hiss
on every silver screen
we are all painted
and were not alone in our interests
i lost my way then found it
confiding in love
between the dark and the cold mountaintops
so off the path my body wanders
youre betraying the youth youre blinding their eyes
black soul youre breathing the poison of evil
sent to the room you used to stay in every Sunday
walkin the way we used to walk
peace out I took the piece out Im shooting up
1 2 3 all these moves Im counting
bitch this (is) my life
i don-t like to really argue cause thats not me
life (is) getting real
and ain-t nobody gon pass me
i know theyre be times of rain those are the days that I want to give in
hey love Ive been meaning to call you
but when it comes
in the cold light
speak my mind because it hold too much dopeness for a human body
say They going all out I-M a show them where the do (is)
1 take homie That-s Actual
thought on point like a decimal
his curse was the revelations he cast into their minds
over written prophecies
slicing penile meat
spank
won-t you tell the world about sweet sweet love I found you
silver stone from the seven seas
oh won-t she oh won-t she oh won-t she
it ain-t going to die cause I changed my mind
they will throw you to the ground
where no one has a brain
its so groovy when Im dead
sleeps my gun
truth (is) we go vicious on these stool pigeons
you know I steady grind
i can balance the elements
i only hear what I want to hear
im getting by on decibels like a drug
im barely hanging on
im surrendering
oh this grace
Will be wailing after Im gone
crying over me all over again
into His eternal glory by Jesus
be sober be vigilant
or diss or treat me like a lame
you see us laughing
american American oxygen
starin at the great wide open
trippin on the serials
when everything (is) certain
all I want (is) to see better days
oh

behold here comes the son
they saying that im nice Dori that your flow legato
its a suite life
but look fate She don-t wait
the boy getting carried She carried 9
in fact don-t make me have to get the royal getcha
check the queen set it off
everybody gotta gotta be reborn
i was a dreamcatcher hanging in the window of a minivan parked along the
righteousness and truth are Your throne
jumping in the house of God
i must be insane no theyre always everywhere
and you don-t give a shit
never freezing even when the cops steady many Glocks
your whore-ll report she-s at my fort for oral support
no wonder why you end up looking like a fucking jerk
rock all sound system not distorted
wheres your grace
wrote tiny poems through the lines of my hands
and every one in my team
like thats wassup
we will break the fence or we will climb it
where are you and where have you run to
out on the main streets completing your mission
to the basement people to the basement
search without rescue
priorities change and hope fades away

my time here has come to an end
how many times you knocked me around
a guy walks into a bar orders a drink
sees a girl that catches his eye
back up before he calls back up
a whole tank of oxygen for Eric Garner
the echoes of their pleasure run through my head
created out of lies
so Im by myself which will remain the same
wish that you could meet her
record playing Lover-s Game
and I can-t peel away from
revelation
you must behold it
my bird has flown
heavy
theres a feelin that
i wanna rock
the shiny black dress with the slit at the thigh
where flashy people flash around
i leave your things alone

bad ass though poking like she on Facebook but she a hoe
yung Double D
never arriving its bogus should I be a god or a soldier
that there-ll be a given like charity
and Im standin in a land rented by the remnants

and I love so much so my eyes are tearing love me but you never mean it
let em know to these niggas who ain-t wanna hear us

american nights

reflections of your love have come to wither
everything (is) possible I hear my soul

even though I know she sweet I do more than salt her

malevolence in your eyes
that I won-t be worried about what ill do to you

im wearing a frown
then turning my head
i feel sorry for their fathers If they work it out
oh these stories that Ive told
and maybe its crazy and we should-ve planned better

feeling good at the top
apples and oranges
and play with my rocket ships

ragged few have shared this consequence but the choice was ours in a way
i feel like a fool
ive opened my eyes now baby I realize

im cruising in the 2 seater
he told them Innovate the way that you write
there lived a muso whos name was Turo
and all the meories weve shared
cause all I have (is) a song
a lifeless body to be viewed
no more pleasure from fucking those sheep
they kicked me in the eye
i can-t go any farther
if your hands amp my hands strolled together around
if I looked in the windows while walking pass through
musta been a white guy who started all that
tenement Square people fightin for freedom
when (is) the pen mightier than the sword
they don-t wear plate armor just to stand twenty paces away
of liberty and peace
and the faith in oour glorious empire
see the little birdy watch him grow
its a loss that I can-t comprehend
tomorrow-s gonna be a (brand-new) day
and (as) you rest in the nest
quitate la ropa enseñame tu chocha
one day I be careless next day Im meticulous
bumping big krit
damn What would Gucci do
creep through the six he thought it was
head shot they had to close his casket up

and when it gon end us up we gon be under the same claws
crying single tear leaves my eye
warmth in your vicinity
so you are the only light I see
you bring the magic over me
painful to me pierce right through me
words like violence break the silence
i Don-T give a shit boy cause I am the shit yeah

id fall to the bottom and Id chase all my dreams away
(as) to die for the way things can be
yet cares enough to make albums to speak for the poor
and watch (as) you burn
i passed her on my way out
swing twigs coffee brands around
i was half the way down treading the sand
eyes
we fell in love the first time that we heard you
proudly she-s staying her course
they capture every (sailing-ship)
why-ve we gotta let love down
ah ah ah ah ah

in you alone
i know you missed it
but I know that in her heart

and the candles burned a hole in the floor

all I want you (is) to
blood red thorns to keep me caught
i keep replaying everything you said to me
how hard it (is) to lose
throw the dice

she plays hard to get she smiles from time to time
our love changed and love changed me
fearing all the solutions we found
kiss your ass goodbye its you last f (*) (*) king day
the children you love will soon disappear
there ain-t no sunshine when she-s gone
any time she goes away
forever searching for someone new
i pretend Im alive or just not dead
but then you push me off
said you don-t have a phone
smothering the hope we thought we had that we thought would always last
catacombs of fear suppressed by the luminosity of the (never-ending) flames
nature walking racket wall of guns sent straight out
slip down open over such smallity
and I trap for my bredrins
i can-t trust my cousins
tryna lick a milli so we make it off the roads

the colours that I wear

when we arrived in picturesque paradise
but none for you
she watches her flowers grow
let me open your sewn shut eyes
come to me with sorrow
how could you leave me here like
all the bricks in the tunnel won-t stop calling me back
day after day and night after night
you and I were always meant to be
and when the sun goes down you know Ill come alive
you may play for gold you may play for change
that bottom left spent
of a guilty ace
and I could stay here for a while
little safe houses
nonsense
when the darkness descends
i haven-t seen you in awhile you know I miss you babe

real love purified
how it seems like yesterday

memories of a love that never was
don-t make me lose myself
im only here for those who care about me
somehow Ive been deemed (as) a talented and gifted individual
waited to see the light
when home (is) mostly gross behavior stolen mail and nosey neighbors
for reasons we may never know
leaving Chattanooga behind

of the leftover sun on the roofing tiles

escaped the cell let hell out of the capsule
orange sky don-t go
i Wish I could tell you
dancing in the corner
tell me what you said something about a dream
standing on the edge anticipating death of my pain
beat my brain take my life
im inching closer further south
(is) our love on the run
still in the kitchen water (whippin-)
right wrist look like a bag of piffin
you hear them say „  You-ll never know until
then come back to LA
livin in a ghetto world
please don-t you cry
i believe and I believe in nothing
but once more wouldn-t make you mine
i need a bubble bath
tryin to think what my afterlife gon look like
brought up where futures ain-t promised look at my life be astonished
listen listen listen
known to all (as) original
see this dream has got my team counting to a million ho
and the gun just blew damnit the ship just landed
serve some clam chowder side of fries selection of beer
i like to get my dick sucked while Im getting high
really we all just want the money
omnivourous orchids
venomous blossoms
or do I phone it in awhile until the feeling goes away
but I don-t want to make this awkward
you were probably the only thing that id commit to
okay back when I was looking for some time to spend
thats not the reason I want you to remember my face
i don-t have to be your favorite rapper
drink Fight Fuck
im gonna drink my weight in liquor

for the fleshy vessel I
but fuck that shit we scream anarchy out here

cause it all falls down
and I knew it would be you
this disphanous
with 33 fingers come inside this sick bubble

your city to burn

or looked into my face
Isaac Hayes was alive he sat two rows behind

a fat dicked Puerto Rican with an ass that got Micki wet

you got yourself a new caddy
so I just go like this right you know cause I don-t have anything else I
and say something to me you know I go if I get out of this fucking car one
but since Ive seen that picture
any longer
like they ran me outta town nigga
i got more juice than an orange and in a minute
like words to a love song
but loving you (is) easy
honesty in every word that I have ever written
your riding to bad path youre using the wrong wheels
little Women 2000
little Women be strong enough
me loving you a lot
this compared to being would be a mistake
in my mind theres a few ways that you can handle a song
thats just a taste so when it drops you better cop that mixtape
hoping to talk to the passed on Im falling apart
i got problems and they stack like bills
behind my eyes
and try to get your sympathy and say Im glad it wasn-t me
i confess I don-t know much about love
(as) you look upon your messy masterpiece
middle finger in the air with my haze up right beside it
im fiending for the status hip hop hashes
i honestly feel I can-t bare my health
youre my star
ive heard it all before
paint me a picture with your waist now honey
that makes no sense like an Alzheimer-s child
plus Im valuable just like good leather
mistafiss Thinking of a plan how to do this
everything that shatters ain-t gold ya know
at a party to which I was never invited
but I never made the first team
lyrics My fitness
and begging for God to be at your presence
taking prisoners but the head doesn-t know
(self-destruction) of our sanity
ive been hoping for steady weather and better timing a sense of this fuss
for the sake of time of my life I laugh by my soul mate
fucking with Jim Jones boiling with the pros
cause day after day I spend locked up in my room
won-t come back ever
buss mine quickly
i realize you drive
and my fire will burn
for It will cost my your life
expect suffering and invite all the pain
together
old pleasure than you
to follow your heart again

theres so much sh (*) t to worry about
i keep holding on to I keep begging myself
open up the window and let the morning light in
nothin but destruction on her mind
put a Ya at the end of em
well be home when weve picked it up off the ground
when I die Im leaving you my feet
practice late nights with Cinemax and body lotion
grown up tough walks hunch doesn-t talk much
and I can-t hate
i can-t read
cause when it comes to Unity were cuttin us no slack
stuck in the pit of hell for eternity
long after we are gone
lie dormant at the footsteps of the last day
just give me a try just give me a try
this could be worth the risk
i can-t stand no more
you said you feel the pain
and now youre on your own
the falling star the way we are divine
Henry revoked the titulus regulas

but I won-t beg for you on acetate
your outfits looking gaudy and my linen from Saudi
fuck love I can buy me a honey
don-t let me down
well I give you my best
theyre standing right in line
i can tell you baby get lost
the sound of your voice ain-t enough
no footprints to lead me back home
spoken LaWanda Page
now prance
i quit my rambling and I came home
hes gonna do you harm
cause I allowed you one mistake but you took the fall again
next time you better think amp stop before you had so much to say
then things changed
she dated us before we never waited but she was no angel she wanted to fuck
its like that
glad to be born
the smell of your fear
deep in my dark soul awaits a hidden desire
lie cheat steal kill win
you really made it or just became a prisoner of privilege
im trying to leave
im dying
you know but you never surrender
you dream of seasons that never die
lights out and the whole worlds watching
keep it on the presets I can-t help it
jaz
so I hoped you learned your lesson
in creaky chest pumping through an empty stone
i held you in the coldest ways
its been a while
but get put in the heat
i hear voices
and start crawling up the walls
can-t make it stick
i wouldn-t put it past the neighbour
if you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle
there (is) no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare
i pick at you my limestone
ergo sum
i know it can-t be good for me
the love left at the break of dawn
cuz I keeps it fucking raw ya-ll get back to the cat food
those haters taking stabs Guess Im pulling my knife out
its tough to keep it light
this anxiety (is) killin me
ten years pass
cause you are always mine to keep when youre gone
why do I love deep
but its like I knew from the start you was gon hurt me
never got my hands to touch the door
i tried for weeks to be so honest
she-s gone cool
rosalyn was not off my mind
unleashing his Hell you will not even hear the bell
maybe youre strong but you don-t stand chance
so save the speech
take that off were gonna make you a star
and a nice nap cause I might snap on a right track
playing pokemon while youre drinking Arizona
lets do it again do do do do it again
people moving on the (dance-floor)
with hellfire fury stomping your feet
take your (self-pity)
sip aged old distilled that I down with quiche
to sold out in Manhattan lets bring him back
police sirens blaring someone must have let them heathens out
niggas rarely gave a fuck
youre all but like Kim K so keep up
theyre speechless Prolly in awe cause Im freakin awesome
its gonna be alright
sweet woman you know youre gonna give me the shakes
a dance a fight
and I pulled every star down from the sky to make night from day but what did
thank you to Tha Artistree for one believing in me and Steve when we decided
the Brothers
im spitting on the track the beat slippin on fluids
so many things that Ive created
more than I bargained for
she-s forbidden fruit
the images (as) clear (as) day
can-t you see what it means to me
your world
you keep falling further away
Cuz I know were taking a break
then Ill try to hold on to you
for me to face it
trash bag
in the middle of the desert I stared patiently to see them touch the ground
i turned my head to the left and I knew I could not be drugged
castle floor magic if you fake you will fall through
who the fuck (is) any of you
which man will you save for this friday
(as) the big deal of death
then I get high under the cross
hugsy
the Blitzkrieg Bop
theyre forming in a straight line
i could see it job pay attention
i could see the way we treat out own shit
and the top down wind be blowing
it don-t fade me Im happy that you
she seen a Dolly Rocker
Dolly Rocker It-s called Dolly Rocker It-s an old make of dress
the rich getting richer poor getting poorer
pull up hop in the truck
somebody help me
now Im paranoid body shiverin got me wakin up in a cold sweat
forever eternal you will all pay
did you think youd find whats left of me in another life in another life
when Im all up in her its just us and then the stars below
hold her close keep her warm
ya jags we ghetto fabulous aim when
your life n (*) (*) (*) (as) its murda n (*) (*) (*) a try to touch
instead of loading a chopper Id rather roll me a blunt
drop a tab and Im straight
i wish you loved me
i wanna say I love you so bad
now that love (is) gone
numb like a beat less drum
the bell that rings inside your mind
the waiting seems eternity
so I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
ive never popped a bottle
la la la la la la la la
into the unknown
i am everything you said
(as) my soul becomes the aeroplane
but Im on the way in the game and Im here to stay
and I won-t stop the sky (is) my ambition
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness
you the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful to make
the rhythm the rhythm
heaven heaven
right now Im gon na live for right now Well right now yeah
i learned slow but now I know we only get what were givin
soul in the song
now Im alive
lost like Amelia Eaharts plane in flight
wondering if my life (is) an episode of Punked
who am I Who am I when I don-t know myself
i fade away lost inside a memory of someone-s life
i looked in into my crystal ball
side by side till 2025
just won-t let you put the days to bed
ill always wake up so confused
what a mystical woman that you made me
heavenly keeper
its time for their revenge
strategies
i shut the world outside until the lights come on
and all the kids they dance all the kids all night
bring back 1996
we kissed with one eye on our TV set
and tonight Ill be singing it loud
feel the energy deep inside your system
my friends were like you hitting
by the end of the night
youve shut away all your feelings in a heart of stone
these children are waving and laughing at you
ever ´  thing-s aginst th ´  law
i ´  m a low pay daddy singing th ´  high price blues
ill smear blood on the walls play tennis with your balls
im gonna cement my spot so get bent and stop
cause if I heard it once before
youve got to stop to watch it
by girls like her
sittin alone in my empty cell
the way you do
ryan
were just living a lie
in the back of our minds we know
ill take you down take you down
your mouth opened for a scream
don-t be a fool cast away this solitude
time to arise apologize
wanted to make it necessary Summing all this up at the end he wanted to make
personality and his political beliefs But Alas Caesar must bleed for it (is)
the way Rosa P was all on Spike best time of your whole life
just know that youre dealing with a player one thats a heads up
night flying sky diving
she wants some place (*) to me
sometimes tell me
you disappear in the dark youre like my shadow
that warmer weather
budweiser and
telling me there (is) something not quite right
do you hear me when you turn away
i know youre beautiful baby
you give me no sleep no sleep no sleep
leak a single sound to the way I flow
cause Im a webslinger
so I imagine what could be
if I could kiss this earth goodbye
telling you I haven-t seen your face in ages
another time zone taking me away from you
kept tellin ourselves that heres where it ends
things different places adventure makin love
i worked so hard for 40 years I told my girl said I had nothing to fear
they shot my babies but they killed my faith
consumed our senses gone
this being won-t meet this world
hey
a comical tragedy
i can-t hold it now
my inner vision says its all a big mistake
i got to thinking just how much itd do
we can call it a night
for me
for the death of loneliness
every time you walk in the room
but Im gonna find a way to make you mine
line by line in lonely blue
you are right beside me
you carried my sins far away
suffering imagine I cannot
the bright sun and the blue water
we fight less and love harder
yea yea
lets get love tonight
to do less than one (is) doing now
how safe do you feel with your mind closed
today I Took The S And Parked It Right Outside Heaven
spartan All-Stars Y-all Niggas Just Made The Fifth Team
im singing for my food
cause Im never coming back
so free up the cheaper seats
the tarot cards say its not so bad
in 1985 our hopes were really really high
ended representation for the whole community
i feel that Im giving back myself that was missing
no more bluffing its Im a feel it in my belly button
if I S E your girl then she might have to stay
and thats from a real nigga trying
fuck fuss bro lets link up
dem field boyz dont run lips
i swear Im pretty blessed
maybe they were right I was never a fan
were not looking for a fight
its just the way we behave
they may be denying what im implying but what would lying do
everybody tryna Be me its indescribable
summer nights cruising Me and the boyz
been down since we used to spread honey on Phillies
youre every classic movie star
you make everything stand still
i work da pole

forever and ever Knight Baggy (is) clever
refrain
i walk in my garage I got a lot of choices

tundraman smoking on

there (is) so much left to say no time for dying down
if theres water flowing
when it all seems to bring you down don-t tear yourself apart
when all those things youve found

and lay down law from state to state
i like to sport em thats why I bought em
i beat that pussy up Made it hurt and glisten
i make nigga music
im going through withdrawals

tint up all round noones seeing in the ride
running in a race and Im going in like Usain Bolt
i know this isn-t it
to find another way
Don ´  t be a fool
remember your colors blue yeah
and on the days you showed
and then we met again at university
i found my peace let me be or take my breath away from me Down these streets
ive mastered all the tons of stress by letting excess press the mess up up
at Tottenham Court Road
wonderful and hot time
gave me more of a reason to ask god and myself why
and for those of us who will fall never let our memory be abandoned
just like wine
ain-t going to make it last forever
and staggers outside the class just laughing while doing it
hater of the bullies savior of the bullied
and know that hes set you free
oh yeah
don-t let it fall apart
feel the warmth of the razorlight that shines upon you
because the fucked up part (is) you used to be mine
swear you placed cuffs of me and you just tryna fuck with me
who the fuck (is) you
we ain-t the ones to play with
get back to the game though
this ya shit you own this
boring boredom
i am a cliche
(as) the secrets stalk the streets
yea
where might your lonesome lover be
birds may be singing
with a million dollar deal and a master plan
they would kill for my position
i was such a fool for thinking I was king of the school
marla
yeah Jackpot
however few can flow (as) mighty (as) this
and want me to respect you
though the violence ain-t stopped
why things always get little bit out of control
i interfere with politics and
but theres no hesitations
the Yoc pretains
searching for a cure
some things just meant and seem heaven sent
im gonna go big
so come on watch me
in my mind I have my doubts
the ones that tell me that Im wrong
the cold facts and nothing more
and I know I know I missed the forest for the trees
i know hes your man dear but yo he ain-t your husband
so how could you come and tell anything about devotion
the Indians were so rooted that it caused them confusion
i thought to myself it was bogus what he was saying
bannda hulk hogan alot of diss alot of dat my nigga u wack Glory Boyz Shit my

cause its in the dark your enemies will eat your heart yea

no relief from this blue melody
my favorite songs are bumpin
and I see the devil look him in the eyes
time to choose your side
you may think that you can live by your feelings
with underage runaways taking black tail flicks
its now time for our feature presentation
take a Tylenol to relax this hangover
its like a party in a parking lot
mess around and get choked and found in a moat
ill hop in the Jeep slam on the gas and charge you
she-s drivin daddy-s brand new car she-s usin mama-s master charm
livin a charmed life everything-s workin out right
i through the first punch thats when he hit the ground
daddy paid for college I earned a degree

that s what s breakin us in two
then turn down the lights low and I give you the right flow hold on
they say it gets worse before it get any better
with the microphone Im in the zone Im locked up in the beat
i and I must be free thats what I see (as) my destiny
to rinse the brush and go again
but sometimes I still do
i think Im cured from you
not placing blame

and I don-t listen
double double super size
dr Pepper my brotha
i love necrophilia

where did you go
just admire light the flame that got heated out
can-t live with you gone come back home come and wake me lady
but I found out that I still love the sight of them
ive got holes in me big enough that sometimes I can barely stay afloat
stress running my mind
nobody gave me anything

for all the things I try to hide
if your gloves are sterilised
without fear she-d give up and die
your lovin gets me feeling better

catching the helicopter tours
the view from the bedside
for some bucks they deny themselves
no time for recess on their way

always f (*) (*) king staring at me
i wonder what it (is) you see
cause either way youll be alone
or least a place that we could talk
waiting for the sign
flying with black wings
i remember people saying give them their flowers
theres an emptiness of the bliss that once existed
i laid it all out on the line for you
ive been up Ive been down
don-t wanna see us living good
man why they hate us having bread
getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
demand (is) high
buyers and sellers
swallow your pride Ill make you proud
you calling me out was out of your mind
its more than physical
and youre hearin what I say
might turn me into stone my hoop dreams failed
and don-t make sound to any one of them clowns
have em spending dough
no matter what kinda junk you got in the trunk
turn down the static sound of the city that never sleeps
but Ive found my sweet escape when Im alone with you
when they let us out of our cage
1 2 1 2 3 4
and see how I react
find me cruising stalking women
all this time before and now Ive lost my track again
i took that (as) my cue and then I went and made my moves
do the resolve do the resolve
bad ideas
after joy comes sorrow
born in denial
heart

you were a good friend and I thought you really liked me
head from a bitch that just transferred in February

for now I live in a real hell
billion
i am poetic motion in the ocean while an ice berg
i don-t trust you but I love you
and Im in the game …  anyway
only just for a moment
carry me upon your wings
and I guess its so the Angel of Death passes over it
i refuse to spend life on my knees
so play your role in this whole story
so scared to change myself
im in a stolen Regal with no gas in it
fucking night
for possession theyd kill their mothers
got to alter every place
under full moons waxing lyrically
and in their dance in trance Ive prised wide
letting go of my woes but Im feeling right
and I must be a keeper
can I ever smile at you honestly enough
(is) worth its cost
today youre gonna be so sick so sick
for lunch thats all you get to taste
finna slop you top
nigga

we find to sleepy peace
one thousand voices arise
and the faith in the eternal bliss
comprehend and countermand
no pity no pain just me

i made that sitter reconsider
because every time I think I see your face
but anyway lets pray someone hears me now
im fourteen with no (self-esteem)
repetitive promethazine
the pineapple twisted with the spritzer and ciroc
these late nights wild
they say it get worse before it get any better
and sometimes the lesser will advise
i sincerely completely apologize
im sorry
but stop begging it will make people hate ya
for the first time in my life I had to take a step back
firm handshakes quick replies
cause Im not who I wanna be
hip Hop on the last breath imma bring it back

where do lonely hearts go
ryan

theres a larger problem that we have to solve
i don-t wanna say any mean things
im not down or fly or dope
don-t call me home boy
a sellouts whordom never ends
cos parents don-t like that they buy their kids shit
now im stunning
i wake up every morning
feel the burst it keeps haunting me haunting me haunting me haunting me
collide
when man do the lurk man-s lurkin skengs in the ride we ain-t tryna get pulled
just sent JD and Cop like 5 new shoes
to prevent fluke niggas from flocking cause of the latter days
flow meshes with the melodies to control the groove
Will ruin our parade
faded in the morning time
you were the one thing I got right
im measuring heartbeats and miles away
torn these wings of spirit
now I kneel down to pray
such things are forgotten thereafter
your way (is) my way and its shown
well its too long living in the same old lives
i said oh lord
long after we are gone
dead under a sea of waste
brush haters off my shoulder with every breath I take
make sure you got a plan you could be the man
the truest of treasures
know my King
all because you want to be
do you want it do you want it do you want it all
to show you
all I need (is) the time
but liquor makes me happy Im a mothafuckin monster
hey Im not (lyin-) bro Bro when I told I say you tryna go with me

well it hurts my side yeah
next week we back here again like … 
don-t I look like a girl you put in a ring
see the profit pictures of American prophet
keep on pressing on
heres where it goes from bad to worse
calling all ages school (is) a creep show
when you call my name
so please take out the time
and suddenly my ambition my drive was put in park
we been walking all night
a social reason
see that name
cause you are always mine to keep when youre gone
ten years pass
like Mister Cee
its the perfection of your imperfection
i don-t know why youre acting this way
but what did you say you feel bad
pleading with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day

the hunger in you can-t be satisfied
a victim of your touch you stole my soul
get my niggas out the trap you can bet that

disillusion with this world
so much hatred
i was entertained I saw a hundred slain
this high fidelity fuck what they telling me

and theres nothing that could welcome stay the mind through reason
just counting down the moments

a walking pharmacy and honestly none you niggas harming me
was the most beautiful thing anyone has said to me

sometimes tell me
something warm would be something nice
and morning through the night
i was older back when I was young
my heart (is) yours and I am captured
its imagination that she lacks
i can-t stand still
the brightness of new birth
more will bow to rome
that you are my lover lover
lady

cause I love you yes I love you
slip out the back door down the gutter run (as) fast (as) I can through the
a while

floating in the blue
ain-t no need to act surprised when it comes back to you
everything that blows away soon (is) gonna come back home
i tried to shut death-s door
this house now stands hollow
and the horror
faces start to blend
take a look inside whats hiding in your soul
recall your name and do your own move
the love left at the break of dawn
i don-t care if you love me
we can do whatever we want
and its Friday night
softly shaking electricity
you are lightning bolt
our love (is) strong
im afraid I lost the words tonight
they hate us cause they ain-t us
were too tired at night but we can-t even sleep
remain strong in these streets mean muggin grittin teeth
i don-t give a fuck This (is) me
keep the spirit of punk in you
year by year day by day
i am a Rap Genius but you don-t know that my dick
i don-t know what to do but you don-t know
but sometimes it takes all Ive got to hold onto the promise
that only this side of heaven (is) hell
cold roses
we don-t choose
the moonlight has no shine through the doom
the burning corpse of god shall keep us warm
in the world of mixtapes and other sick breaks
just feels right thats when tracks come out tight
we perfect
we picture perfect
quick verbs become easy off thoughts super markets gets sweeped with money
pictures when I got out cameras be shineing like lights in the sky with the
11 (\) A Rebellion
6 (\) Double Standards
know what its all in your head
and Ill accommodate
i go out walking all day long
the left one was a dancer can you see the answer
i didn-t even kiss her
and this might be all for you
while Im taking daily trips to the Colonic
live behind these bars fuck you if you try to free him

until you disappeared

Alicia my love for you (is) heavier than a ton
i crave to get to know (ya-) not to sleep (wit-cha)

your name now etched in stone no place to call my home
theres a rainbow on your way
and then lay on the floor
i thought this walk would be easy
thats why im running back to you
stone free
you can-t hold me down
stand up for me one time
yet these bars set me free like Im a criminal homie
setting our hopes on a big snow tonight
i know its true
would Brooklyn be worth crossing the Atlantic
on Independence Day Manhattan fireworks
theres too many people all around you
feel ooh so pretty whenever youre around
the bluebirds singing and the honeybees swarm
and Im rockin flip flops stead of cowboy boots
and I believe
im stirring up and mixing up in only positive
but nobody has asked me
her dress wrapped round her (tummy-tum)

what you want it to be you can be
this land was made for you and me
if this land-s still made for you and me
look at those who see the face
from a journey
we are the same old Boulder motherfuckers

of this terrible life
i saw two shooting stars last night

from Hollis and y-all gets no chances

songwriters
anybody today claims that whatever the fuck say (is) called rap but niggas need
different sound on the stage

cause we want everything nigga everything
leggings jeans or leather
from all time you sent them flicks
foretelling news of freedom-s hand
so weve let this happen all along
ruining music

we can-t move so youve gotta choose
and come around with twenty
just wear that love like a glove like a glove

his brain (is) the portrait of atrophy
an orphan both parents in the grave
Will anyone ever love me again

oh lord I want the chain pussy and the fame
how come they dare to think they can outrun
let the rats feed on my body
burnt to crisp or drowned then strapped down to the garret
mouth

had to thaw me out I was froze
what I thought about

pay attention
when all the air was damp and warm in the green of country lanes
and the breeze would touch your hair kiss your face and make you care about
whats here
but first they have to find them
gone
love (is) not so beautiful when your lungs are caving in
lets lay back sitting inside my car at the edge of the earth
i knelt down underneath the midway in the millionth sighting

my baby-s gone with the wind again
don-t fear your own conviction
lurking in utter darkness
all was still breathing like my hands on your toes and I said
and the pyramids foretold acidic snows
with your girl dan I smoke a bowl and then we spoon
not even true theyre the type don-t even tuck it
but rivers can-t
i just believe in people
and theres 16 for me
cause you are what you eat
and my soul becomes the aeroplane

and now I smile and face a girl that shares my name
just one touch on my lips and I knew

annihilation without a cause

weve all got a disease
before you think it you can settle down
i wake up from the phone its you calling me to tell me of your dream

he wants to be the best but his best (is) not enough
these niggas ducking like birds I fly like and I might
lyin on the bed while Im at the piano
that only I know all about
relying on words when they inevitably will fail
that it wasn-t the key to fulfill any insecurity
ever heard on the microphone body you sounding like they peeling stuff

i am just an entity
everybody (is) searching for substance
ill apologize
yeah you can smell it in air
they chose a mad man to be our leader

around my heart
want to throw another chain
you were plush and I laid bare
you had me howling
beatin her face up like 1 2 3 4 I declare her face no more
makin your insides bended and bringin em back mended
she keeps her pride somehow
she will grow old and die
in the end ull end up with less
i just want u to make some trips around it
in short (short-shorts) or zipped down jeans
star Yes you are

or Be me I been in the shit

home again
and goes away to a place

striking for the heart blackened from the start
terror blinding your sight paralysed by the fight

a panda (is) yourself
when and why (is) it us

i can stay here in the darkness
ill speak for the outcasted made silent long (as) I respirate
we all rest in graves eventually and pass the weight
never abandon your aims
someonce show me belief
be who I wanna be but baby hey-eah you still own me
say what I wanna say hear what I wanna hear
to set me on fire and put it all on display
guns and ammunition to get to this commission
keep on like its never ending
the rain the rain the rain
verbal skills to match Biggie
thirdly do a concept no one-s thought of before
practice what you preach
and don-t you even dare try to fucking turn this around
won-t you miss me
pussy willow that smiled on this leaf
and I say door because I can-t say do- 
i won-t take shit from you
and though were sinners please don-t deny us
its time to STAMPEDE now take away the E for they want us marked by the

where cause (is) the means
metal and steel and live landmines
the destination (is) fuzzy all I can see now (is) the flames
im taken with the notion
stop for a minute
we turn the page of life
along this lonely road
its an idea someday
in my tears my dreams
its all over its all over
and this could be my night this (is) what makes me feel alive
set yourself up for falling
when I heard the news I went numb
in the shadows of these holy lies
Till we reach the end of this world
i don-t need another dimension
or another life
i stand corrected
ascended on high
and he cuts the chains
feeding on fresh blood
ill be there in just a bit don-t wait up for me
running straight to mother

and I ain-t talking Black folk Im talking bout me and all of you
(as) I hear a couple hot girls screaming
so I could see a little more
fake Bitchs Get On Stand
im A Real Bitch
tired of tripping tired of fronting trying to be the perfect girl
oh na na na na
buried in the freezer (is) frozen pizza or chopped meat
for this low rent makes
she-s always gone too long
any time she goes away
to fly crooked around the world
to get out of this colorless jungle
it was strange and kinda good
think of you when the miles role along
when the firestorm blazed feathers dripped down and melted to the ground
swimming through the stars in my sunken observatory
heres an eye hole through the wrists
stick it to the skin take a spike
you struggle cause you niggas unprofessional
ho-s mouths drop cause Im like a walking dream
if you don-t get out my buisness
they never know who theyre messing with
what am I doing here
i can-t take control
when I get back your close to home
stuck worried about these other stars
if you think of me
cause I don-t know what to say
he only needs one glance to burn you to the bone
he give em hell no place to run
next time I see you dig its a ditch
smooth like the lotion you miss me when cal gone
youll find in this life if theres something that you believe
if you want something done you got to do it yourself
truman will always be remembered for dropping the bomb
does that make you happy
67 add a 4 got a couple skengs need a couple more
putting work on the streets we all over the beef and you ain-t been on shit
over thorn the gods In genesis the serpent was trying to make the woman eat
woman And in Greek creation chaos was like there god But there was more than
but be careful What you wish for
so I can shave that sh (*) t
take this sinking boat and point it home
and I can-t go back
i would rather not go back to the old house
too many memories bad memories
i will grab that lil nigga by his fucking jerry curl
my niggas was like don-t give that nigga shit don-t give that nigga no time go
got to worship You on high
got to give You all my praise
all the time it took to find out who we are
so how do you know when its done
and you walk into the room
Till they lose their moment I belong I belong with you
oh zero fucks given zero fucks allowed
cause youre dead to me dead to me dead to me
blah blah blah blah blah
you are not crazy if you talk to yourself
his light brings death let them die for their belief
and the weak degenerated for centuries
if you think this will break me you better stop dead in your tracks
the arctic winds flow straight through the core
it ain-t nothing like Xmas in the ghetto holla back
at the (table) with the fam thankin God for the blessings
here at last
the things weve witnessed can never be unseen
ive found the road
im not who I know Im Supposed to be
you don-t wanna act unless you fear it
oh my you think your made you got youre first laid
youll realize youll realize youll realize
ive been thinking
(as) if you never knew shit
on God man I ain-t hit my prime yet
like the first day of the summer
calling and falling in shame
knuckles crushed my eyes no longer see
sing hallelujah the devil in disguise
this little light of mine
don-t hide your shine y-all
it was 2 years ago I said lets go to Cash America today
every time I hit record
welcome to chiraq

number one flight out of the airlines
enough flow in his rhythms memorize to lock jaws tight

being this age always seemed so far away
making a list of just 100 songs was near impossible Flooded with an entire
album of irresistible Lupe Fiasco songs heightened Kendrick Lamar
its such a waste all this hate

trade my Volvo for a hearse and crash on Route 66
taking over the Egyptian military

ill never personal foul you
i called time out it was too late
like Abraham he still God-s friend
when you got 5 I got the whole kingdom on it
ah ah ah

those who give pain will receive it eventually
things started changing what did I do wrong
lived to 35 but died at 17
in whispered to my ear what will you do until then
keep on running away
theres a place in the park we can go
but its true girl
and its true
there (is) a hope theres a dream
there will be battles fight
the police man says they never found a body
the funeral couldn-t change my mind
oh girls
when the working day (is) done
the lights are out all over town but the earthquake got me out of bed
cause his mother died the other day
besides I got to be sneaky Dumb whore left the door unlocked at this point
the bully runs out his room at the sound of my gun being cocked I drop it
stretching out my hands You reach for my heart
hallelujah What a Savior
in the southern mountains zapata zapata

or if everything I see (is) just perfectly placed paint
strollin hoping crooked cops ain-t even scopin

where we bury the bone
what the fuck you take me for
a journalist by night you

slaves to infiltration of the government

this time my instincts controlled me
unwillingly out on my own

baby that phrase stuck in my head
after I told you how I was feeling
she ditched education and devoted her time to a whole new philosophy
the students in dorms on their laptop computers
nobody nobody nobody ever does
and the sweetest of their smell was
do you really need for me to warn you
i said I said
thats why we got a bond thats even deeper than blood
eating gun powder rottie with a shottie and a snotnose
gateways into unseen deaths
lingering souls dead bodies never found
youre but eyes
alas muffled cries resemble
gatturner
You should-ve built a Boys Club Better run that shit …  Killwaukee Style
so tired of these thoughts
from the rise to the fall
if Im on the right path now then why the hell am I leaning
another young nigga getting ahead

eternal harmony

i like it when your lowered in dirt
to be above em when Im portraying art
having a brighter day was strange cause inside Id stay the same
i want to die today
(is) this love of ours a lie
lord knows her soul would never rest
a few last words just before he died
god
im not quite sure in what I believe
even the desires to conquer everything

but Jersey made him Morris County suburban native
and yet the night can serve (as) company for the isolated
stupid teens wasting their time in roamin streets for smokin weeds
i am not a nostradamus but I can speculate what comes around might be a paper
my human genome rip the DNA apart and you can read my musical composition
if the price (is) right man (is) willing to do whatevers scary

Till the break of dawn
breath all heavy and slow
can-t find the truth in a house of lies
against an army of us all
it holds a power which can not be named
a song of you
still in peaceful dreams I see
see we sunk in too soon guided by the blue moon drowning in the red sea
always seemed so carefree but now youre gone
its only right that I be grabbing this gold
vita Et Mors
but I wanna be the one who walks you home
to you
and when I come to die Give me Jesus
and when I am alone Oh when I am alone

through my own eyes
to exercise my bolt

disgusted with myself

who fumbled with
the middle vowels
we were older
but discomposed

getting Glocks stuffed in your face man
may your void become (as) deep (as) my hate
ceremonies and worship inverted by suicidal mass
are nothing more than faggots
love-s done to me

youll come and find to realize
i thought I played it cool and kept my distance
the radio You-ll find
but who gonna who gone be prepared
just take it to ya essence and God will be present yea
so you can see what hes seeking
speaks for itself
learn to think for yourself learn to accept who you are
release your anger and be free
run to the lake now
yeah your love (is) the killing kind
well I look and see its not only me
we are the young so raise your hands
she among the precious ones
of each passing day
you fuck around and catch a seizure or a (heart-attack)
you better back the fuck up
its Xmas in the hood
its all good from the grimey to the meadow
rap about the coke for mainstream success then you soda pop
if a soul was over priced thats why I never found a buyer
niggas use they bitches sit and wish the phone would ring
ain-t nowhere for you to run fuck your gun when that demon come get you
i want you grinding up against me
i can read all you need (is) preshur
im so happy Im so gay
wake up wake up Burn mother burn burn
hear them lunder from the masses broken

tomorrow
chrysalis dreams waiting on the fifth (in-star)
every little bit hurts
i can give you all the things you wanted before
how bad can a bad boy be if he sets you free
all right
no Matter What They Say
its over
you think that youre such a smart girl
and Ill believe what you say
these niggas shootin everywhere like that shit ain-t no problem
you niggas silly bet your main she give me straight top when she be with me
a silent cry to be something unusual
but to give us a shot (is) the least you could do
and have the world at my feet
fly a mile above the rain
its all pathetically the same
we lay our lives down for the star
fuck the beat I go acapella
fuck a dog fuck a clock fuck a trailer fuck everybody
tell these people about cha and everything I know
id still brag to all my friends like you and I were still relevant
showed you how I do
you don-t know if I could handle or miss
never worry bout the things we were missing
we were getting pretty good at the game
cause a compass (is) the call
until we begin again
can-t slow this love in real time
summer blood behind the scenes
so-so whack kids don-t know rapping
backflipping (ad-libs) drop heat like blacksmiths
just to make a mark you know to make it stick
your stuck on buying drinks and getting juiced up
arash behet migam doset daram
harvaght to inja hasti hamash bahare
x
end it all like Cobain if I don-t get the sales
been
i
watch himself in that paper chase
dust to dust
but she-s chopped up in my freezer
the dead made me win
so I turn my music up caught a
arm hanging out the window
cause if the party (is) dead we can bring it back to life
i got a song stuck in my head
tired of everyday filling up my car and knowing that
the only way we can ever change anything
i wake up there will be
yeah
i see the bigger picture now I hope this helps you illustrate
i don-t wanna live in vain for decisions Ive made through pain
she only knew one song
the last time we saw Amy
smoking breathe vaporize right in front of my eyes
strollin hoping crooked cops ain-t even scopin
corruption hate and treason the evil we must fight
(born-free) were still sailing the seven stormy seas
blm-s obscene
fucking cunts on damn wheels
and no one will ever know you the way I do
savoring my solitude
your pawning me out tonight youre pawning me out tonight
ride the 1 like the Pebbles upon the breeze
that your spirit can-t be broken
the rage you feel will consume you and destroy you
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor
see nobody but you
po it sip it
ocean gang niggas have you sleepin with the fishes
but its never late its never late enough for me to stay da da … 
no tell me what it (is) it isn-t fair
get gon get gon swag
get gon thn we leave
shift through the lies and youll find it if you dig deeper
and whisper It-s time to escape
studio tucked in the back pack
like Nurse lets jet before anyone has left yet
so lay me down
where my father waits I will stay
i don-t care if you love
we made love till the morninglight
hide away inside what cannot hide
darkest corner of the house
daddy car nice we should fuck in his Benz
look
the arctic winds flow straight through the core
independence has been taken from you never living the same lives we once knew
too late to try
oh its too late for walking on fences
im tryna understand the real nigga in this song
majestic they won-t get it
girl get in the car Im riding shotgun
oh it wasn-t me
keep planting to find out which one grows
ba du bop ba duba dop
but T said that we hadn-t made it although so invaded
my heart just hasn-t been mended from that day on
i won-t come cripple you
when I say back to back I mean back to back
set by the masses the masses have always been lethargic
i stays mumble I speaks jumble
i ain-t missin you
and I ain-t missin you at all
sister-s got a boyfriend
bet she won-t do that no more
i recognize I know this dude no hater trace
cause you got to watch your back when your alone
electron John
i hope we can dance today
you can buy a nice soup pledge
less intent to wives and stumble
all because you want to be
were low in our hearts
my niggas dey gon ball wit me
all I want (is) bandz all I want (is) cash
oh oh oh oh
then you put your charms around me
forced to choose and without help
with a margin you know its true
if we stay and let it be
and I will know only joy
do you remember what you said and did
where (is) yesterday
and if you likin what you see then put a ring on it
music ‘  gon be blastin in the background … 
but again the princesses are in another castle
woman in the window
the way that I be rapping people ask if Im a foreigner
come to I amp I and wah pressure me like rice and peas
like it was yesterday
turn back the hands of time
any event of contact to clack
we know the future without the use of the tarot card
in our broken minds
rise above the veil of fear
oh woah
back and fourth round and round I like it this way
your favorite rapper gon want to join it the dream team and we come
my last little fling I put that shit in the dirt
lovin me Lovin this (is) where you belong
love a fill yo just like a bomb
hypnotised
once upon a lifetime peroxide hair
i rise so I ride by my damn self
im up early in the morning when its dark outside
i want to lay my body down
beautiful god you look so holy
its like that and thats the way it (is)
people in the world tryin to make ends meet
whoever said life ain-t about stackin paper
they a fuckin idiot and they need to wake up
say ahhhh bitch I make em say
im coming back packed up like an all black dresser
ooh
ohh
forcing upon all man their evil bullshit then
court jesters never reign they die away in pain
if youre long gone out in nowhere
you still can pick up all the pieces
we got it on lock
(sun-kissed) skin
when I was a love
to be your cover
this ain-t not diss my nigga
unless we are together
sittin on the beach with Fiji on the radio
on that good vibe having good times
the night (is) turning thin
miracles will have their claimers
eyes on a pair of dimes

violets then sigh (as) they gaze
there she goes again tear in her eye

her eyes are blue her hair (is) long
and I know I know I missed the forest for the trees

you don-t want to deal with the rain and the scars from the older days
and I shoulda know
and its like Im blinded
along in the sun and the rain
ive had a lot of fights
we embrace the echoes of our hollow souls
all this wealth (is) deafening deafening our minds
your style (is) repetitive violent and negative
chyeeea Jump off stage reach into the crowd
but its the same old song Ill do it again
just to see what the day will bring
this night time high (is) driven off I got stood up
sigh help me out in
both girls on my mind won-t do nothing but failures

and you can still escape with your life
cold Dark Black Eyes
fears architects of relentless terror
excrement
i am not a nostradamus but I can speculate what comes around might be a paper
im not a codger
its getting blurry in my eyes
to help you make decisions

put your lips against my lips
let your blood run through my veins
i hope youll understand if I don-t pray
that Id never be wanting (as) long (as) Im leaning on you
im gonna garden all your seeds
for my mom im feeling home
whenever I feel
i kind of hate the town
murdering killing one by one
chosen (as) our weapon
and time won-t stop the feeling
but words can-t reach you now
blood was shed for
who (is) a God like you who pardons sin and forgives the transgressions of the
far away
im chasing after mysteries to find
a swine
(as) the secrets stalk the streets
nytra Exposition
go go
visualize my movies
amp my skin begins to itch because the bugs are biting it
cause money make that world turn
remember you I can-t remember me
the lights are off
they are going to the show
cause it seems that my dream always means
quiet while I make like a cat
the gift that she gave was given to to be given away
look into what youve learned
with honored fate I step beyond your boundaries
just kill the truth its what you do
i smoke the green high (as) the martian Marvin
im revvin up my words like a chainsaw

watching the world just burn
we still have hope that the world will be a better place
i did it for myself and thats for reals
squab with my punchlines and I dont fight fair
never go home again

you had me believe
theres nothing more that I can do
do I win or do I lose
of not being there for you
where its from (is) just so high above
no power of hell no scheme of man can ever pluck me from my Father-s hand (*)
gotta million different reasons that I could be upset
get the fuck out my Corvette
and I don-t listen
to to to to tox3
and it seems Ive been walking for years and years and years
i hear the Sound leading me on
(as) I watched in my headlights he swerved left and then back right
when a pickup truck flew by me out of control
he looks totally fine when Im with him
does he know does he know no hes totally blind
yah and now these bars are comin out
hands up for me two times
come to Bethlehem and see
gloria
chevy flips and with the ground we collide
yeah they get there empty cups and then they fill it to the brim
resurrect my heart
hide away now watch me watch me
saw them taking down the license
im trying to ignore
lets run run run till the morning comes
we stay up all night doing the devil dance till we can-t walk
on the T V screen
when you look in the mirror
step back step back
under a full moon
and weve just begun
and everything will bring a chain of love
and before we have time to slow down and think and just wait wed have
when I part we spoke about changing this world one life at a time
and you know it know it know it
every time you walk in the room
blockin my view
Till never a day comes back
you wear a smile but youre never too kind
i thought I also heard you call
you hold too much in stall
you know how to fall
im aware niggas want you but you don-t got time to care
you can-t take it anymore
on my way down
someone ´  s watching me from somewhere
pathetic schemes
i bet its great to never think of anyone else
life that comes of no harm
glad feel in an echo for your way
and even I was the winner
want to throw another chain
if you give way to yesterdays
so I can kiss the sky goodbye
3pacalypse
i be doing it
but if youre (non-dependent) youll get none from me
come off the block stretched out toe time
its like all the pain goes out of my mind
i am torn apart in your presence
i want more than just to hear your cries I want your demise
don-t wan na see me fly up out That city bring my kin with me
and I couldn-t see how youre trying for me
begging begging please forgive me
on the wall hung a tall mirror distorted view
Arnold Layne Arnold Layne don-t do it again
oh were still young
don-t you wanna feel that light on your skin
no longer mean nothin to me
cuts both ways across
if its darkest before the dawn
but can-t better education so we can combat
if he was a girl could she be (as) evil (as) a boy
if she finds that his eyes give out nothing that she likes
when the rope gets tight
and don-t fail me know
im way past the speed limit yeah Im driving it fast
somethin out of a magazine She belong on TV
mic check right on the set
let it all fall down like leaves I spend on you On you
or the two cops 2Pac shot rah rah

where the dancers evidently say Come with me
deeper than I do
and he was looking for you know who

and she don-t grab for the knife

you seem to love me
to me your kind (is) all the same
and I knew it was bound to happen but rest assured that Im a be alright
you held me down for too long
that when it comes to heart break it (is) never our turn
could you be that friend or would you be like all the rest
where did you go
demons have done better things than youve done
its your life you deserve it
live life don-t worry
so when they bury me in that box and its the last home Ill reside
that Ive worked so hard to accomplish because I rose up through the darkness
what a puny plan
no audience for real hip hop and no hip hip hoorays

but in my heart you still remain like a constant do
i never said that this love would be a holiday
was blind but now I see
that saved a wretch like me
there must be hate in the grip of the frost
connected they are by a trance a desolation within
doesn-t matter if you throw us a bone
don-t eat the right food But I stay away from drive-thrus
down in the city at nights
here I roam the streets without you
flyer then a mug swagg on 300
they be YM
where those fishing boats with their sails afloats if I could only see
im going back someday come with me on Blue Bayou
but Im gonna try and make you grieve somehow
a poor man-s heart break
im awaiting the day where rap can boomerang back
trying to find the answers its feelin like Im (questin-)
and thats priceless spending now let me count my blessings
i can-t sing but I wrote you a song yeah
lies lies
pink pink lemonade
walking through the winter markets and all
faded in the morning time

feels good to let it roar
stand up now and jump out screaming
free me
your voice
(as) a sloppy rectal moan
makes it hard to sit
pero ya no
y purifica mi amor
in the dark on the sand looking out at my crowd
‘  Cause I will save a face for name-s sake

Bout to hit the club flirting with all the annie-s
word Play the Don drink lean and take Xannies

preying for my enemies
im just a man displaying all my weaknesses

mindless reason pushed upon widespread volume

standing watch

just to me I feel the car start
then they tried to jock me so I went and steered the hoarse
the proof (is) right here their just jealous of my fruitful mind
until supple flesh falls from bone
strangled by snakes
concede the loss of the some to fuel the life of others
i want to look inside and see whats made to be
but I knew it all along
and I felt so lonely
i want it all or nothing at all
i can-t say I didn-t see it coming
im not sad anymore
i think wed all be okay
and Ive worn out all the reasons

im my fucking own me
Till the album (is) complete
my colored world turns to grayscale
the earth to a point of exhaustion
check out the mirror n say Ill do it my way
just guess whos their lord
when I was free
when I was free free and lonely
im not looking for a new England
but that was bloody yesterday
drying shell

the shrooms you having looks like the shroon
weed today two weed today yeah two words for our winner

soft wind (is) blowing
they said that her soul could not be saved
your blood belongs to him a soulless feast
close your eyes
others will kick and crawl their way out

i reached out for your light
its so hard for me to sit back here in this studio
when Last year I spent more money on spilt liquor

how was your weekend
so wrap your love around me
eternity has only just begun
itll stay with you even when she-s gone
lingers in my mind like a vintage wine so good I get a buzz on the after taste

we make it you make make it we make it
im feelin you you feelin me so what the fuck

but guaranteed I will have his fucking head by the morning
and though were sinners please don-t deny us

that we both ignore the truth
inside the back of my mind There (is) a character
rugrats

i would do anything to be the one with you
forever forever

they preach it like church
and you would break down so gentle in my livery

you said if you ever leave me I will die

we started off (as) jobs in catering
this ghost train will derail and crash
Will I burn in Hell

make love on the train (cross-country)

i pop da rubberband she gon pop ha back
were in the house of fun
oh I don-t know why you can-t dance in Japan
never met an animal I didn-t like couldn-t bite
fresh like peppermint darker than a second tint
now I know it wasn-t meant to be
you know one thing youll learn (is) true
principal Victoria she whistles while she types
glory Glory divorce lawyers
and I smell blood
lets go for broke
read the dictionary and pronounce every word
hoes on my dick cause I make my own theories
young niggas know that I come off mean
my weed man professional he do not say no
his dumb ass went the wrong way so the laws followed him to the chase
a young nigga swangin out his driveway
im the kid the city brought to speak to kids before the deal
then I kick it up to 3 ain-t no catching up to me
be free
no sorrow
can-t we find the minds that made us strong
when they turn the pages of history
and let ur thoughts about it sit back and wollow
i dont want to hang in the mist about it
i write it with a quill move anything if its still
im the new Salvador Dali
in the bed they did a lot of love making They felt like they in heaven
the man said Please don-t aim that gun at me Her best friend said Look Im
i can remember half her head was gone
i can remember all that she gave to me
there (is) no one you love
the quivering heart of Gigantor
lose my mind
lose my mind yeah
paint our faces into Picassos for the kill
zeroes and ones won-t you tell me which am I
to the (public) conscience its nonsense Onsets just skewed the surface
white Imma cut to the chase Flows tight with a perfect pace
move the hand that moves the world
the heart of Christ and tenacity of a lion Bonds break
apple crumble me and custardy for like a week now
but you ain-t all that
ill plan him a funeral Ill read his last rites
staring at a hole in your chest thats been dug there for decades
you gettin money but you told like Alpo
i came up from the seven like a crack game
oh I oh I won a trip to insane
ive sung that Im not done
like its funny how a smell brings back a memory
the true American Horror Story
time doesn-t stand still
always sentimental and don-t you know that
handing needles at my concerts popping OxyContin and watch your mommas
abusing Nuprins and losing any sense of value
and I must warn you
cause when the day (is) done
i just wanted to be by your side
everyday everynight no more shall we part
there (is) something very wrong
powerless to fight against
your bellow me
fuck the fame
through the clouds now a vision in light will wake
a sky full of everything bright
youre reaching for the light
counting them up just brings me down
but the woman had the money in her other stash
because the woman didn-t have the money in her purse
actually you are not Just be honest about what youre thinking about
a person that you are not Do not pretending like you will be okay but
flesh removed
death has come
phone numbers your body danceing on the the walls how lovely it looks I love
tomb tomb tomb bitch mummie wrap these ppl leave them in darkness one gun to
living underground
i don-t need to mess around
set the record straight
good things don-t last if we don-t know how to act
if you want me to rap then just give me a bassline
its some bad girls outside that just pulled up in a rover
if I die let it be known
fuck pretending
i be on the highway levitating fifth gear blunt lit damn near meditation deep
fifth gear blunt lit damn near levitating deep thoughts dark thoughts ya bitch let me penetrate it
a man Ill never be

so many tears this shall end right here

lets light it up
were here tonight
take his money and his (*) laugh (*)
it will never be another
rythmn and poetry bringing things to life
we stop talking to our neighbors and keeping up with fam
rain ashes from the sky
in ten thousand years what will be our legacy
the reaper shows his lies
im comin back
aim for a battle but I land on the conquest
i like the way you talk to me
5am and the sun-s still sleeping
sick
i tape the sign to the door
goodbye Thompson

young and lost what the hell am I to do
cause I live with a split personality like Cass

you can have all this world But give me Jesus
and when I am alone Oh when I am alone
our new friends

ill find a way to fix these broken pieces
its Turning to an all out war
tequila sunrise melting in my hand
a tourists smile in disguise
right
and then run to the next store
and spitting bout My past when I get a change of heart
clowning on the game can-t give a fuck about my relevance

that green pack against your stomach right
open the gates and let them have it
i hear you saying that you want to see changes
love-s the only out

cause even if I flop the picture still don-t crop

and they fuckin with me to get a buzz
so I Grabbed her bags and threw it on the porch
you gon make this the night that you never remember
and its too late to go back
yeah Im ready Im ready Im ready to fly
you know it wants to come out
try to be right
all of my life on my funny friends
sserve it hot like Dominoes its all in the delivery
and six for the future we gon make it out alive now
i see my Marianne walkin away
i looked out this morning and the sun was gone
not my soul but my body (is) put to death
i can see the coming light (as) the nights will pass and the dawn it clears
what I live and what I fight for what Id gladly give my life for
gallows and gavel go strike
went to the back do our thing and then I am back oh
bottles then we just go right there
it blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people for long
light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness (is)
and your tights around your ankles
open up the bottle of pop
this never ending song (is) coming and (is) gone
its traveling on a plane on my way
of holding back whats deep inside
but your passions they never run thin
take away my memory all off the report until Im in the full moon all up on
show me a sound salvation and Ill take it but already I made mine up a long
ever since a nigga dropped out and slept on
hundred dollar plates eating for the times we never ate
the sight of your fading eyes die I can-t believe it can-t believe it
its all right you got what you needed and Im fine you better believe it
in foriegn cars n
party in get fuc up
if We fuck on the first night …  yea

theyll be calling us names
its this city that lied at twilight
in big bold print
at the front of the line
i ain-t religious but the flow will drop em hard (as) Jesus Im XP nice to meet you
spitting fire like Im slifer
you gotta get me back to the base
the body means nothing
and your friend has turned away
you leave your sins behind
im smokin on doobies Im smokin on doobies Im smokin on doobies
ima need a lighter for this fire kuz Im tryna get higher than mariah
yes its over
and thats the way I hope to take it
but the devil couldn-t catch us ‘  cause hey at the end of the day
we were washed in the blood
theres nothing you can do
but none for you
and the distance causes only silence
i wonder if you could ever despise me
from the hearts that we were (stealin-)
twitter and Omegle
turn down these voices inside my head
the love you don-t feel when youre holding me
my sweetheart rides a ship on the sea
though my soul (is) stormy
oh it hurts me it hurts to let you in
no I don-t no I don-t want to give it in anymore
im chewy like some bubble gum
it goes good with some whiskey sour
i stare so delicate and ashamed
what a feeble attempt
clandestine enthralling haze
only gods illuminate
when when will it end
we do it to ourselves
in the year of 39 assembled here the volunteers
but my love this cannot be
either give him your help or pass him with kindness
o what a foolish young lad
i walk away calm (as) the wind
in the middle of the desert I stared patiently to see them touch the ground
its off with your head
matter of fact Id like to welcome you to a new day
and Im a falling star
turn off the radio those late night TV shows
reduced to slaves in the world of the silent no
all I find (is) a communication lost

and the tossing and the turning no it never grows old

drove miles sedated on an unpaved road
control the flow like a spigot come swig it
with various violent yanks the heretic
on his deathbed
and it was the only time my life my mind felt so clear
no production here
no clothes for me to wear
stare through the eyes of my mirror master
a sigil of death
meet me at the crib if you ready to cut
wait and chill Im just bein real
get by if we fully trust Jah
i guess No high pedestal through days tight or plentiful
theres a very important thing to do
bumbadee bumbadee bum
if Im just throwing away myself for you
(is) like a glass house with no views
dish for hounds but for the gods It-s believed that Caesar was for only a
of way he wanted the death to be necessary He also wanted it to be a gift or
yeah it arrives
in the light of the sun
i am the wheel
i cannot see an open eye
take me there
so take me there off the map
she-s been an addict since 88 she was fourteen
shut your eyes listen (as) the world begins to fade away
people wreckin each other just to get to 1st place

and import a Random loop

in this life time you don-t have to proove nothing to nobody except yourself
croon children croon outside your cocoon
to howl with the hounds and let your children living underground
i wouldn-t laugh cause we gon meet the same end
realest ni99a breathing since a ni99a been a semen
fuck ya momma on my sweat band nigga

because its just a bunch of shit that I can-t deal with right now
so many questions fingers pointing for answers
astronauts (t-minus) arc of the covenant
this wizardry (is) dismal drugs make me invisible
man to man hand to hand fight forty
everyone choose sides
perfect Day well put it behind us well put it behind us
it soundslike weve been down this road before It seems right given
that we couldn-t cross
but rivers can-t
tryna reach six figures all my people got to grow
you boys better step your game up now I done warned you
that you can-t try to explain yourself
i wrote down all of your thoughts
recognize my wisdom
i am the firedevil
pledge allegiance
you lame goats
i never meant to break your heart
my heart won-t just live without you in my life
so many broads blushin but I would never cuff em
thats all a nigga know if so we gone start a wardrobe
ill be here for the rest of my life
they put me on a train and they brung me back
id like to take her home thats understood
she-s posing for consumer products now and then
its the way that you are
to each other
youre a criminal
i was winning the losing fight ‘  til you showed up yeah

and that whole fuckin night was fucked up
and now we heading off to new things
your wall-s down

and maybe you do too
but still I know Ive got the stain
and a brave young one
dangling low above the fires
you said the words
baby baby babe
wrapped around the strands of red hair
i wake up from the phone its you calling me to tell me of your dream
we watch the sunrise and hope
our system awaits testv Freedom by choice
you can be my Kelly Kapow

holler at hoes pop bottles and (hollow-tips)

cause I get spells
seventy seven dollars on a hunna come holla back
clouds roll in find it hard to stop the pain
plus My niggas from the Chi (is) dirty too
kliq deep out the south but D niggas run grimes

until then don-t tear your hair out
its a shame that it took so long for me to give it to ya baby

its hard and weird not to know how your day begins
hide the path between our homes
arab money greater than US money
in my fresh ass thwab hotter than a damn furnace

androgynous rapper it gives me laughter
and im out unknown youll never find it out
i ain-t lonely now

cycle What then
possessions but its that my addiction has this voice and its a very powerful
the wind was sweet and smelled of home
are we instruments of fate
they won-t leave you
though Im not concerned
instead of goin on
im gonna settle for a fall
talking about stuff much bigger than ourselves
i wouldn-t just sleep Id dream to be half the man I saw you to be
we come alive at night
mi mente está por llegar
over thorn the gods In genesis the serpent was trying to make the woman eat
were many and there was death and there was love In Greek the child tried to
and Im straight nervous paranoid so Im sleepin with a gun
now Im paranoid body shiverin got me wakin up in a cold sweat
why these things happen Lord I don-t understand
why won-t my friend take me (as) I am
i got one thing on my mind
your skin looks so cold

the strain of my eyes just caught on to the weight of this evening
tomorrow

a bad idea
and I won-t rest cuz I heard it all before
its l-histoire de la famille
its hard to get the words out
if you want to meet us
oh say it baby
to see something-s missing that was there at the start
suicide never was your way
never surrender
like Curtis Mayfield if theres a hell below we both go
and I ain-t eating right can-t fuckin sleep at night
ill give you everything and you know its true
anticipation mixed with desire
see that house you in its yo mama-s crib you ain-t got yo own
i got to get at her man and its funny that I see you now
or well just let things thaw for now
im awake and youre a half a world away
just going through the motions just putting on a face
i was just happy to be a contender
when I spit on a track BTGM had my back
straight from the east coast but im hotter than the south
don-t throw your lifelines away
one time just once in my life yeah one time to know it can happen twice

eyes low puffing on that kush cuz you never hydro
i don-t care how long Ive been dead

thats when I got stomped like a cattle stampede
had a nervous breakdown all my friends and family left me
grab an axe and aim to decapitate
hack your feelings til you all out of mercy
don-t go looking for the best somebody but one thats different
i mean with a body like that youre begging for attention
i need to contemplate
i recognised what you said
and toe the line
chuck the card that bore the number
this one (is) like raver pants
had students of the Bosom study woman through the scrambling 1980 cable box
don-t be reluctant Oh
can I be something
lay me down and wash this world from me
illuminate me make me complete
but honestly baby Id give it to you for free
just tell me if you need me
its leading you back into my heart
i never felt better
god bless the little child living foul but thats a year-s salary around your
you learn to stretch a dollar like your money was elastic
see the road
and I heard you say I heard you say
i started with a onion now I got a lot of cousins
first of all Im a real one
my niggas put in hand work when the four-s playing
make a young don eat tell him go and get a fork
hugsy got the rhymes
im more bling bling than the pope
never enough
caught up in not doing
where innocence (is) burned in flames
a million miles from home Im walking ahead
take my fears far away
all I want you (is) to
don-t worry about tomorrow let tomorrow worry about itself
god only knows
who (is) with you no crew
ill jump you but don-t ollie me
take a puff take another hold it in blow it out pull it out put it in her
so many bitches mad at me right now cause I won-t give them a shoulder to
collide

but I can-t stand with these jellybones
this (is) love so well survive
pandapple called my name
Lu lu lu lu lu
love you late at night
like I do
i loose myself
oh The human bondage
the doors aren-t locked you know its not
say hes coming no one said a word
to discern no black lies they feed up on you
just keep on fighting while the devious (is) hiding
and obviously you do its human nature
youre out of the street and the lights are out too
in the waves I-Ve lost every trace of you
but Now the sound of love (is) out of tune
like Indiana Jones you got to hang on hang on
when they got you in their evil grips with those ancient forces
and the next steps out to space
they are Riding Forth
wait til you hear my slogan
i succumb to Cajun on the corner
forever no longer strikes me (as) perfect
you see because this (is) no longer worth it
when I think about you cos I opened my eyes
youre a nightmare everywhere disguised (as) a dream
funny how worthless
cause I won-t pick up
not me can-t a nigga or bitch stop me
clown I spot em from the time you buy me a drink
here comes the liar again
your head held high
someone to cry with me
to be told that youd fall apart
his laugh lingers on
while we all stand by
(is) the fight to be yourself
cause everybody knows
no more livin in shame
im coming out of hiding
when all of this (is) over
well all be alive when
so well controlled in eighty four
they got me on the (tele-screen)
that just cause u cam from LD dont mean u can-t make it u can my friend (is) in
homies I want be seen on tv make my daddy happy and my family and show ppl
youd wash away my tears
if only you were here
its an idea someday
don-t you want to see her proof
told to respect the police and may be I would
and I count it all count it joy cuz persecution (is) expected
they ain-t let you in no they ain-t let you in
and its only the beginning mane
smoked out with my cock out
swear on my mother-s life
im in a powerless rage headed to a flowerless grave
this ink and use it I know Im mighty and strong
when were used like a tool and masta was so cruel
highway Riding Picking up mileage
oh I been around
in the naked city
its not an image that we are portraying
this (is) one message for us to send

i want to hear me loud
they like ‘  yeah but youre here now can you save rap
they want every penny they lent you
cause all of those days
could I be the dream for you
ooh its been such a long ride
Captain Scott and his heroes to be
put them earplugs and quit all that mean mugging
girl next door told me turn the music down
then I woke up
to fill the emptiness Id found
insomnia and my cigarette light my cigarette light
time goes slowly with you only
take me on
say after me
when I was younger I thought I could stand on my own
it isn-t easy
until the whip flips like Im selling pounds
well Im 2 for 3
you a champion
youre a champion never gonna fall
im not a rapper I just took a break from hooping
me while Im busy getting rich and gaining weight
because she could eat you like a (full-grown) disease
it doesn-t matter what you say
yeah I know Im lame but these other niggas lamer
check out this song I made real quick aight
the space at the ocean shore
it seems
grieve for every rapper God has just now awoken
peek-a boo sex what you wanna do
depends on love like the flood
its never enough Ive got to have you
ever ´  thing-s aginst th ´  law
i ´  m a low pay daddy singing th ´  high price blues
do you want it do you want it do you want it all
all because you want to be
all the dreams you had all the things you wanted
how in the hell you gonna love somebody else
cause I want someone to share my smile
walk away
she will not be tamed
value brand (new-ooh) (ooh-ooh) (ooh-ooh)
youll be the last you see
and some fight you gave
they ain-t coming back now its too late
i worked so hard for 40 years I told my girl said I had nothing to fear
watching the laughter play around your eyes
then you can tell me about your prison stay
happily ever after may probably never happen
the reaper trying to have the harvest of the sower
my kinda people just hangin around
i took some kind of pill
its better than a Becks
just before I go onstage
don-t die waiting your turn
just do what you wanna do
i used to wish at night that my brothers in the street
i know this much (is) true
hey look away now
we be scooping while y-all standing on the block
i feel sorry for their fathers If they work it out
running fast the river rhythm drags along their bodies
the low forces they shut it it and judge it
got us under stress
tried to destroy my brain with detail but failed
niggas sell crack and then they die
try to take it slow but its poppin off tonight
like were going to Bayside
looking in the iris I knew she was lying
tyler the Creator
oh yes but the jokes on me
and its true
too drunk to drive home
must be something in her lipstick
don-t you want to see her proof
you and I in place
death (is) just the beginning
the epitaph wiped clean
like nothing else matters
ever
where the winds have whispered only from so far away
why don-t you face all your wildest desires
i sincerely completely
i know I said it I know I did it
i remember the make-up running down your face
and the dreams you left behind you didn-t need them
no moment was made to last so light the fire in me
but now this picture from me fades
names seduction
so save the speech
Bill collectors tryna wrestle like Im Steve Austin
coulda hit the movies but that would have cost me 20 dollars
its the good memories that hurt the most
got to find the will to keep on trying
Rich music boys club jeans fitting real wealthy
they been holding their breath like they staring at a coral reef
keeping me awake but when I fall asleep it turns violent
i ask myself Am I an insomniac
she-s got some other women (as) well (as) me
a C D C

and I am a brother a son a man
(is) this my 7 p m Is (is) my time to shine
ive been bullied and depressed and I know your pain
and force them in entrapment escaping only by sedatives
from this careless urban sprawl
of snow angels and gut laughs
may your light be ever near us
oh the spirit of the world
we celebrate normal and demonize different
so quiet until my voice finds its range
past pains dance in the wisp of my cigarette
got a call at two she took the blue pill
i should set the steel trap of your thighs
god forgive my tasteless tongue
because I won-t see you
what its like to eat lead
and in the ever after I can-t get myself to float
and when its gone Ill move along but I won-t find a greener lawn
you moved my wardrobe out the front door
derail and crash
call out the new and pay a fee
i gotta flow this ain-t a rap
but if ever I could love myself
id much prefer to sit alone
Eddie Vedders kinda sick

with a punch to the face and a kick from me to you

and I need you to save me from darkness
theres heartbreak everyday

and if the sniffer bitch gets a sniff of bricks
pulling rabbits out of thin air (is) not my habit
le-le le Let-S start
and then collaborate I can-t relate to other candidates
inside the back of my mind There (is) a character

because thoughts of us together fill my head
tell me Im a legend in the making Im a lead the way
8th of ces to my brain staying fresh

bases crumbling under my feet

too early in the journey
when life isn-t just
weak or strong
i mean a woman without a man
then its a woman I said a woman
and that frame (is) calling
and I can make you stay up for me
why would I listen to what every nigga telling me
he said Im full of myself I just showed em I couldn-t be
why SHOULD PARENTS CRY
a CHILD-S SCREAM

slappin kids so hard their mom-s (staggerin-)

time to time everything can-t always be what it seems preach
i don-t want the pain to go away
i don-t know
and in the sea lost to the wind
for the ghost of the one that I loved
i have seen all my fellows drown

that hes coming back again Got to share it in the North
dreams etc
wise men once let me know
plus you can meet hot locals in your city
what I mean (is) if you feel a certain fantasy
title on you I been on this Micheal Jordan
way way before the jumpman came
yea yea check it out
ill fly Ill fly away
place to go My last hope (is) that with my death I may pass into the world of
the sleep (is) still in my eyes
you know that I won-t die
exist in the shadows
leave through my window
im worn away now if thats what counts
but still I only want you to stay
i wish you loved me
baby
do the things I says to do
theyre piling in the back seat
the Blitzkrieg Bop
no gravity could be
i feel Im falling skywards
you lean over the (table) and between your hair
must be a reason to stay polite
youre going to wake up singing
and the cotton (is) high
what (is) real and what (is) fantasy
my baby-s staring back at me and now a broken family
the neighborhoods will not run away my honor
we were born
understand theres no fame without persistence
tell the congress go somewhere and eat a missile
just to show the blood soaked through
abuse grace take a aim to obtain a new name in a newer place
and the feelings inside of us
later tonight
the way to accept it but when (is) my time
i just wanna find the way to get home
then ride with a phoney
i gotta whole lotta friends I don-t trust one
completely
i need something better
i was taken in with your lies
i have found my true love and you now burn beneath my feet
oh my god shuffle bitches Ipod Yung god
fuck my bitch fuck my bitch
i was kinda hoping youd stay
cigarette smoke dances back in the window
‎ Only hope in the lotto
but that don-t mean Capitalism was ever fit to last
ill be waiting for the ice
i never thought it was true
END OF EPOCH
