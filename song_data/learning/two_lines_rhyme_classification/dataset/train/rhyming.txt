oppression and torment killing to defend their faith

Till we master our destiny we ain-t packin it up just yet
whether or not were about what were professing
to make a phone call
not every day but pretty often
cause all of a sudden I knew
only your strength can see me through
sipping on lean straight from the medical
dumb shit x7
now go out and get yourself some big black frames
with the glass so dark they won-t even know your name
let me hurry home to you
let me hurry home to you
your body pressing against me
your body pressing against me
thats a feeling that no soap can ever erase
you shoulda seen their expression on their face
block it all out and youll feel adorned
not hard to sleep on a bed thorns
so if you don-t live by that gun
cause Woop hes gonna wet some shit up
its not about you anymore
its not about you anymore

above our lives
in the cold night
where Im who I was born to be
im not who I know Im Supposed to be
not how you feel
in the land of the free
empty out my pockets

flexing like you someone youll get robbed in (public)
she ain-t got no sisters Imma fuck her cousin
here on the range I belong
i know when night has gone
i played your records through high school
i played your records through high school
you hear the day beckoning
know that its all in your head
this world wants too much from me
this world wants too much from me
dormant
ill smear blood on the walls play tennis with your balls
ill always lower my defense
when this dance has begun
my dreams would be constantly melting away
asleep and constantly floating away
so tired of you making love to me
then disappearing so suddenly
so Ill have to be movin a long
and lighten my heart with a song
thats why these bitches be actin kinda funny Im yung well that may not be the word I beg your pardon other rappers are absurd thats why

from the unbeaten ways of primal man

just go on to let you know I flow on
oh thats your bitch on me
molly Murk bet your bitch know me
the only thing we enjoy more (is) shooting them with a tommy
isis be chasing after us no way we gonna stop
we stash chips
reveal your blade (as) the battle begins
don-t listen to the words they say
when youre far away when youre far away
you can-t control everything
youre hanging by a thread
crisco unleash the dragon
wrekless bitch
dreams are like a rainbow
dreams are like a rainbow
every time you think of me I hope your heart dies
its time to let the world know how you tried to ruin my life
ain-t my thing man I don-t know how to twist a rhyme with another rhyme but by
are you talking crap you can-t even rap this guy thinks hes all that but I
you sure convinced us all that youre a world class sinner
youre running in a race where theres never any winners
to have a rubber bun
car on wheels of sponge
(as) I shave my beard I gather a toupee within seconds
i be that hairy mother fucker Poland-s what Im repping
and turning around and talking and pretending once more
bitterness (is) sweet cause its funny after all
lets just live my love
than any other
i am a poseur and I don-t care
i am a poseur and I don-t care
sweet flowers blossom when I smile
and my heart blows wild
still don-t know why I write but if I had hype
servin everybody with backhands but Im tired of life
eating corn
watching porn
without remorse
pain will make him soar
were a flame
watch you over all the children in the rain
and you busted your back and you didn-t get dinner
music fish
if I don-t wanna be with you
standing in the cold grey dawn watching cars go by
so the child sat up and began to speak for himself and said
im the alphabet accelerator set the data test the fate a- 
where they at boring people
i got the ladies live on the cam show just got started
he drinks the venom desecrates the shrine
tonight
heart full of liust wickedness their treasure
they blasphemed my name with pleasure
it seems that the death of metal (is) close at hand
are spreading through the land
and Im never coming back here again
and youll never be my friend
just a desperado with a sour twist
and itll all come sweet on your lips
powerless to clear your mind of what youd suffered
what possesses me to right what you have suffered
y-all niggas ready
im ready
then hell try to flatter you with chatter
not in terms of words but in actions
thank you for being with me tonight
he just travels on mile after mile
give me your eyes
if I could take the fire out from the wire
Sans Red If you won-t wait for me
i will await
this was all a fantasy of yours
i was never yours
she loves me she loves me not but she-s got the power
im picking petals off the flower
now that youre gone I just don-t know what to do
its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
of guilt sense by facing my mistakes
lights are fading
not every storm clouds got a silver lining

taking our chances with (moments-old) ideas
and if we run and hit a hurdle

a slave to the mundane
calm seas never shaped the greatest
but he kept hearing voices
an all-American boy
and machine hearts
who drill you diet you treat you like cattle use you (as) cannon fodder

trying hard not to hear
their piercing sounds fill my ears
same place
visions of something getting closer but I can-t see its face
inside that beautiful place
there was so much emotional pain
ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis
you ain-t gotta be all up in my face
Til we found out that love (is) its ground
fearing all the solutions we found
climb that ladder to the top
push the product sell the crop

recording in the studio with rolled up marijuana
octagon fighting and swinging for at the stars
down in a hole
down in a hole
and ohh

realizing Reality flaunted rough crimes
cuz it haunted my mind And made more tough times
through the trees
by the breeze
it only seems the more that I grieve
not the one that I lead

its straight genocide of my people and whats sadder
tell youths to stay in school research and manifest
like my undies

cocky and I diss you but watching all the same
im a femme queen Mother of the House of No Shame
im on my way Im on my way
to ski in the mothership
we all are programmed by the government
atomic artist
i hang with wifey and chronic growers sonic harvesters
only the brave dare to follow
unto the realm of tomorrow
the mystery tends to never wanna die
magicians appear to be in black and white
to think of her was to want her
i know that I was better (as) a loser
but its hard for me to see where ocean stops and where sky begins
every time I feel selfish ambition (is) taking my vision
that right here tonight
your riden
one time for the ones with data but no daddy
no shade see the view no canopy
if I had Edward Scissorhands hands
and accidentally injure every jam band
or any way you can take it
tonight im feeling im wasted we can make it
don-t wanna live here anymore
no take that ribbon out your hair that we can-t afford
i want her to see the butterflies flying in my chest
walk by a church seeing a sermon in prayer
but liquor makes me happy Im a mothafuckin monster
metropolis fight to survive flamin holocaust
clips loaded who wants it first protected here there almost every place u
hands up in the air tonight its my night to shine single ladies hmu on those
so when you think that you know it all and youre rushing to grow up
don-t alienate those that matter cause you might just push your luck
satisfy me
if you want me
and were burning daylight
the hour (is) getting late
when I least expected
could-ve melted
emotion too remaining
from a man from an Asian clan
i knew all about your plans
i really did understand
whos been fighting his demons
sharks that be fiending for some meat
im bored bored with you
life (is) cheap
i can take a few people but I need you to feature with me in a rap
i ain-t like some people who gotta be so damn crass
its deadly poisons writing your name
where hell and all evil will reign
life can try to beat it out of him
life can try to beat it out of him
i see him all the time every minute every hour
our love (is) like a lime sometimes sweet but mostly sour
know that youre the reason why
i dare to live My life
and all of the streets end when they don-t begin
i can never find I know I am never right
i grew when I saw every dream wouldn-t come true
finding out this isn-t you I went 10 0 miles in another-s shoes
its a strange course
its a strange course
too escape you bitch
lyrics
so let your flowers grow wild so you can show your child
i stole your tale because you told it to be quiet
would you believe that a woman used to belong to me Yup
u know the bus
i ain-t with the bull homie you can keep the BS
so that makes me so fresh and so clean
i dont know why man but I feel like somethin positive
and I wonder the matter the someone batter your heart a lot
about whos wrong or right when
about whos wrong or right when
thinking whyed I even stop
now Im walking in the dark
the destination the crossroads
the abyss to the earth to the waters
my wrist be so flutty
where the roots
see the little bird fly round his head
its said the winged in (post-mortal) visitation echo well
a protozoan evolved and grown who made a home a page of poems
nah I don-t think so
every time I broke down I said
never let me break down again
running in a race and Im going in like Usain Bolt
so please never let me slow
changes changes
so many things have changes
be like dat
can I be like dat
i think Im goin crazy
feelin like Im stuck in a maze
patterns Ive made before
don-t want you here no more
the only thing in gambling (is) weather to take miles b rips
rotovegas (is) where I keep my chips
and bring you a dozen roses everyday
youll be my breath of air
i don-t care if you love me
i don-t care if you love me
but whats the rush anyway
but whats the rush anyway
you got a problem admit it fix it and forget it
some men feel like they can fake it to make it

thunder in my mind
until the end of our time
its so wrong together

and it will take a little while to get back home
someone at a show
you made me love you
im a sucker for you
forget the rest of my troubles I need malt
its a fascist sport
to the darker sin
wait for the Spring
and I think that just like I did that corporations can do that
and They pumping people-s gas
lost my viriginity to a girl who didn-t like me much
i don-t hold grudges but I don-t pull punches
we do it over and over and over again

your face in broken pieces don-t you look down
academic Probation
weighin money like Damian
shining my mind stays writen like books on paper I keep on burning the papers
key to the gold chain I wear keep on walking on the moon stars on my back stay
im feeding off anger
drowning in the madness
but hang around this corner and sing the poor stranger blues
i would stay up North but theres nothing here that I can do
i was tryna vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti
she was tryna vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti
your mom would probably get a heart attack if you came out the

a few patrons recognized us We started going through the pricelist
that they call hazel
and see her face in every passer by
i Couldn-T stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit
i mean they come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
who said nothing-s fair I say nows the time to take
i can feel it rising up again
still you poison the good thing with all of your lies
all right
and bust a move to the rhythm
use these haters on your back to energize your system
(is) this my 7 p m Is (is) my time to shine
or (is) writing and rehearsing these rhymes a waste of time
leave you in a house of wax like a museum figure deadened
on pin head a thin thread (is) what holds your life together
na Na Na Na Na
na Na Na Na Na
hold them both together
to learn more than ever
dont care tho Get a nigga get Jacked likee Sparrow

pass me the Cisco
its only calm if you know you lost it
time keeps dragging you down but you got it
of my blue prints and the true sense of these words
god he lives within All of this hes heard
though she-s pregnant (as) can be
so that everyone can see
trying hard to feed the fire keeping strife alive
quarrel of every kind
cause death can-t take my special lady from me
how can I tell her that I love her if she doesn-t know me
half full of happiness
half full of happiness
deep inside I muss carry
im a little angry
im lookin for the words to say
and I Im getting too close again

ive been looking for a love like that
on the job it couldn-t come my way
cause its time to give the Lord some praise
to prove that you love someone you do not need to sign terms

Till the stars start falling till the wind stops calling
Till the stars start falling till the wind stops calling

or notes that fall gently like rain
and joyously screams out its pain
he found the killer weapon in his car on the floor
driving back to the 10 house city something (is) wrong
all roads lead to roaming
looking for the perfect time to go like Ive seen in so many other homes
get your eyes on the street
i should have never move your heart on the beat
doesn-t require any religion
a theme played in my mind started to reminisce
sending up prayers hoping God catches them swift and slight
taking me on a roller coaster faster than the speed of light
i want hugs not your scissor kicks
i want hugs not your scissor kicks
all we get (is) a little piece

owning up to mistakes Ive made
painting chaos on a canvas reading Art Of War

that claim that their bars are the (raw-est)
and called foul nouns and adjectives
satellite phones TVs in every home
satellite phones TVs in every home
the strapped feds for no reason keep leavin theese blacks dead

and the sound of a shower running softly

two foreign bitches with me so its only right I let my top drop down
northside where you better not come around

stories told in camera phone structured like a stanza poem
watching all the ants go home he was left alone
drawn
i flare at the thought of mingling with you frauds
freedom heaven-s hand high
to set at right the fire of light

while problems were resolved without involving any common sense

we had to rise
we had to rise
the way I hand you a vice
ill rearange your face like
for once they enjoyed a peace of mind
the fire reflected in their eyes
that youre the kind of ho that I should make a move on
the kind of girl that you could be down for
for I Â´  ve lost my love in the rage of my revenge
to the meadows I will never leave again
how could go away like that
how could you leave me here like that

my mum came home drunk
somebody should go over there and do something
rottweiler

red bone in a Lexus hectic

but young enough to know that I am well
when all the trees are reaching for us
they rip your soul out of its place
when I am lost within your space

hard way Or should I just go get a job Being broke (as) a broke ass bitch Nearly
ive seen it before

wherever you are wherever you go
of somebody-s heart and somebody-s soul

the blood trickles down but your eyes still dry
creep in your sleep while you say goodbye

unhilt the black grimoire of death
glowing darkness keeps me warm
you are the night with all its charm
and when that shadow smothered me
a light I chased in front of me

a celebration heartache
we lay our lives down for the star

strapped at the hip like a fanny pack
and so he stayed and played at home until they burned it down
and when there was no bench to sit on he would just sit on the ground
i long for I need
sick of being seen tired of these
while she-s faded
and this grade
then All I hear (is) gun shots

thats the way it should end
i done got so used to this just happens on the regular
forreal let me tell you whats regular Benz truck ain-t regular

you were my favorite star
so tired of being told to keep polite
and were alright
in starlight
in starlight
i work so hard
and from my flesh I shall see it rock
the water I drink (is) the blood on my hands
wandering through broken shadows
a place of my dreams
the stars appear along the treetops

can-t keep my eyes off ya
that my love will see me through

the ambition for excess wrecks us
when youre fighting for the Beamer the Lexus

sitting on this cash like I collect it
flow hard so I think Micheal Phelped it

cuts both ways across
stupid teens wasting their time in roamin streets for smokin weeds

overwhelming me
Will just make it
and carry me away
and if you should hear my name
i cannot turn my feelings down
it took so long to claim that I knew how
time so god kicked them out of the garden and gave them punishments
in the genesis archetype god made every thing from heaves and earth to man and
ive found my home lives at the Rivers Edge
force feed a dream in a state of pure unrest
made up of these three words that I must say to you
i just called to say I love you

from stills cold hand theres no reprieve light the fire in me
because thats what you gotta do when you live the same shit different day

and louder than a microphone thats slightly near a lion-s den

and discuss your worth
or just cuss your words
ive got this gun in my hand
ive got this gun in my hand
and it can-t kill me

he was calm
momma always told me to guard my heart
in my homegrown dojo I flow over labyrinths
backflipping (ad-libs) drop heat like blacksmiths
help of the helpless O abide with me
i triumph still if Thou Abide with me
and then someone told a story about something dead and gory
sweet nothing I made it up

and when it falls beneath the mountaintops
and I will know only joy

metal health will cure you crazy

deliver the smooth flows they demanded it
when they can get an MP3 from a friends CD
in a couple little shitty rap videos on TV
if trust would be my lover Id take her anywhere I go

bass leaking like some oil when I hit da gas
yeah
i was lost with the night
i was just passing time
ill stop my heart and then Ill wait for you
i am just a silhouette to you
another line in your private joke
but refused to crawl back home
come crashing in into my little world
can-t you understand oh my little girl
were gonna run and run
ooh were in the house of fun
weezing choking on the bone
through the hole
i stopped stressing the day I knew Pac got haters
like Edward Modrake some are two faced
he turns the walk mode on
he turns the smile mode on
how we live and fight (is) who we are
isaiah 6 8 Matthew 8 20 Psalm 126 5 Matthew 6 26 II Timothy 1 7
always special in your heart
always special in your heart
every last person who helped you become a man but you never became a man
hope not But we are a family And even in this fucked up day and age that
and luck said Double damned
were losing sand
they want your heart
now that youre gone
a rainbow through good and bad times
a rainbow through good and bad times
whos been disappointed once again
so she takes a drag of a cigarette

but anyway lets pray someone hears me now
i should be good at it by now
yo mommma calling me cuz she a stupid ho

menage a trois don-t say jack then walk quiet like a ninja
lets put it down to light
by the hole it leaves behind
run
huh
breakdown
and they say
took all my lonely nights and ran off with my bad days
you kicked my door in and stole my heart away
youll be in a black bag with that new path you call swag
Muhammad two piece I gotta hit harder than
and takin curbs with ease blowin trees
i represent the Eastside no peace fuck the police
ill make your bed
im on my bed
reach tonight
i know where we can fly
got treasures of wisdom but they selling fool-s gold
i will do everything I can to make your name known
selling our bodies to unmarked cars
this Motor City can make us a star
won-t you follow me into the jungle
won-t you follow me into the jungle
ring ring ring
call you quick
i won-t pretend that Im alright with settling left and right
everything-s empty but I see the light
lucky that I didn-t crack you
because I I really loved you
fill me cause Im running dry
before the well inside of me (is) running dry
about the clothes on your back
you ni99as weight me down like anchors
then in this song Ill stage your final breath
you know Ill take back everything
thats just some shit we never do
fuck with my camp you hella thru
sing with an omen
no
or least a place that we could talk
(is) there a place that we could talk
this (is) our home
torn forced into the dark
of horrid rectal breath
it rips the flesh
gaze on my feet floatin off the ground
and no shadow of a doubt
am I confused or
looking at society police always eying me
this pain descends
why did I why did I leave her there
we all have the choice speak in fear or make love your voice
theres so many ways we can change so many ways to see someone else-s point
to behold its glory
dawning
i keep on tryin
hard (as) I try
im like Jesus in this game Arthur and Omega
what my mind conceived (is) what my mind (is) bearing
first night of Biggest Loser boy ain-t nothing light
and with these bars I should be in a cell for life
for a precious few their lives are humble
their lives are humble
wearin my heart between my legs
and I shed a tear between my legs
on that day when I see my King
on that day when I see my King and death has lost its sting
but fuck that shit we scream anarchy out here
when the sex finished
estate of thoughts consigned
so what starts (is) a blush of mind
confusing me
breaking up (is) a heartache for me
dropping shells sit him right back down
life on mute won-t make no sound
then my music-s not for the streets
and when I rap you I want you hear every damn word that I speak
on and on
night with me
and please yourself at the same time
now if you don-t mind
i woke up with a start and a pounding heart gasping for air
suddenly I began to realize the eyes I did not recognize
and I paid enough attention with that last quote
but thats another song that never gets wrote
all falling a victim of wishing
but No nobody wanted to listen
black gold stuck to their veins
raking in money the evil to praise
ill fuck you if you take off your bracelet
got that opium and that angel
there are times in this world nothing makes sense but the dark
your world (is) falling apart
youth club me stiff rick and tones
thinking bout the days when bricks were phones
and if you wanna step to this
ya betta be the real thing
have I been fooled by wishes
have I been fooled by wishes
bliss Is this finally landing that first (kick-flip)
so you could be showing off representing the click
thats enough
thats enough
looking for a new sensation
just like your mother said you would â 
she-s freakin out on glamour
i feel so romantic
behind excess stress and no caress this form of society (is)
cathedral the peasant the pope the hope of the people (is)
running out of time
take me for a ride
but then one day you came into my life
all my life I been waiting here fo ryou
i keep blowin down the road
makes me feel right at home
who said that you need to go and change
don-t listen to a word theyre saying
to conquer the world by your side
i had in mind
she saw my lips move but said it wasn-t loud enough
so she pulled me in just to turn me up
throughout the grapevine
he was the cr
real talk ain-t nothing new like a thrift shop
nigga you don-t know the half life before this Hip Hop
fire-s gonna burn you back to me

with every beat of my heart its getting dark
its such a crush its getting hot
all I know you know I show you baby
through your head push to you baby
im lost in your love
please don-t hang up
im finding love in it like Southerners
woke up in my back car seat fucked up
the other 98 (is) stresses that the game bring
old fans that want me talk about the same thing
i go St Patrick pin me with the Medal of Freedom
the snakes moving through the Garden of Eden
i don-t need her
bitch think I love her
and ended way too soon
you walked into the room
unless It-s all about nutting
kei Shon Son
can you feel your heart beat racing
it doesn-t matter what you say
my whole life
behind
and we on and we on
and we on and we on
cause Im scared that this won-t be shared if I never wake up
but then you forget when you wake up
a mind full of haunted shadows
unlock the doors to forgotten fears
birth
the devil touched the cradle god gets his curse
open road
driving in my car damn near cut me off now youre in the fastlane so
i shouldn-t loved him
it really broke my heart to see you pushin that whip
you don-t understand it
when you should want to fix it
we can hit the rewind and do it all over again
lets do it all over again
while my cousins go to bed with their wives
and a small knife
a river of flowing fire
behold the stone with 7 eyes
the more things I need
in my fu (*) king world Ill never be free
look in your eyes and know just what you meant
i want to feel your love like the weather
its high time
she changed my mind
life drained from this house just like a virgin crime
cold nights Lives wasted away in the light

sorrow and pride chaos and peace of mind
stay high like how Im supposed to do

conflicting concepts of preservation so we were measured against standards
hands tight all grasping in space

beijing students fought armies with guns and knives
but no one had tried them all
that chick across the bubbling wall

hopelessly knowing whats right or wrong

run aground in cities and towns when
and the sea come and sweeps us away from here
and the sea come and sweeps us away from here
you can-t remember what you said

standing strong the only thing that we fear
five hundred years of tears we still here
the heart feels what it feels and then it slows
its a difference of opinion we think we know
