oppression and torment killing to defend their faith

Till we master our destiny we ain-t packin it up just yet
whether or not were about what were professing
to make a phone call
not every day but pretty often
cause all of a sudden I knew
only your strength can see me through
sipping on lean straight from the medical
dumb shit x7
now go out and get yourself some big black frames
with the glass so dark they won-t even know your name
let me hurry home to you
let me hurry home to you
your body pressing against me
your body pressing against me
thats a feeling that no soap can ever erase
you shoulda seen their expression on their face
block it all out and youll feel adorned
not hard to sleep on a bed thorns
so if you don-t live by that gun
cause Woop hes gonna wet some shit up
its not about you anymore
its not about you anymore

this world wants too much from me
this world wants too much from me
dormant
ill smear blood on the walls play tennis with your balls
ill always lower my defense
when this dance has begun
my dreams would be constantly melting away
asleep and constantly floating away
so tired of you making love to me

so Ill have to be movin a long
and lighten my heart with a song

crisco unleash the dragon
wrekless bitch
dreams are like a rainbow

every time you think of me I hope your heart dies
its time to let the world know how you tried to ruin my life
ain-t my thing man I don-t know how to twist a rhyme with another rhyme but by
are you talking crap you can-t even rap this guy thinks hes all that but I
you sure convinced us all that youre a world class sinner
youre running in a race where theres never any winners
to have a rubber bun
car on wheels of sponge

i be that hairy mother fucker Poland-s what Im repping
and turning around and talking and pretending once more
bitterness (is) sweet cause its funny after all
lets just live my love
than any other
i am a poseur and I don-t care
i am a poseur and I don-t care
sweet flowers blossom when I smile
and my heart blows wild
still don-t know why I write but if I had hype
servin everybody with backhands but Im tired of life
eating corn
watching porn
without remorse
pain will make him soar
were a flame
watch you over all the children in the rain
and you busted your back and you didn-t get dinner
music fish
if I don-t wanna be with you
standing in the cold grey dawn watching cars go by
so the child sat up and began to speak for himself and said
im the alphabet accelerator set the data test the fate a- 
where they at boring people
i got the ladies live on the cam show just got started
he drinks the venom desecrates the shrine
tonight
heart full of liust wickedness their treasure
they blasphemed my name with pleasure
it seems that the death of metal (is) close at hand
are spreading through the land
and Im never coming back here again
and youll never be my friend
just a desperado with a sour twist
and itll all come sweet on your lips
powerless to clear your mind of what youd suffered
what possesses me to right what you have suffered
y-all niggas ready
im ready
then hell try to flatter you with chatter
not in terms of words but in actions
thank you for being with me tonight
he just travels on mile after mile
give me your eyes
if I could take the fire out from the wire
Sans Red If you won-t wait for me
i will await
this was all a fantasy of yours
i was never yours
she loves me she loves me not but she-s got the power
im picking petals off the flower
now that youre gone I just don-t know what to do
its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
of guilt sense by facing my mistakes
lights are fading
not every storm clouds got a silver lining
when people would rather see you fall than fly
coming to carry my soul down with him
coming to carry my soul down with him
yet Im still poised and offering (as) I tread the living room
didn-t expect it now no not now why its so soon
but I don-t have no say
don-t wanna go away
never Looking back
walking up my pathway

now all the idle hands of the factory have been told
see I need you boy

leavin you (pistol-whipped) in the corner with abrasions
part of the contamination of Mind State
but recently it feels (as) though theres another whos much faster
laughter
everything I did in this life
and It seemed like just a portion of where I spent my days alive
but in fact when I was reading this I felt like it was a wast of my time
you might be trying to diss but in fact you should be full of fright
and well find another way to be happy one day
and well find another way to be happy one day

got demons in my head pumping through my arteries
music Thilo Hermann Rolf Kasparek
hunting the serpent erasing its madness
i might (as) well just be dead
im on the seabed
woke up the next day like oh oh shiit
my se Ã noritas full of tequila
the alarm doesn-t go off
thats flaw
took the kids to her mama-s theyre gonna spend the night

praying that the pain stops
i just buy her a drink and then she gon wink
your girl call me Slick Rick after I send her this dick pic
but my ears are sealed so tight
but my ears are sealed so tight
ephemeral boasts doubts
for exit out of the hosts mouth
styles Cuz you are ratin baby
1 I just bought four joints today
i feast my eyes on the enemy
to follow your heart again
his curse was the revelations he cast into their minds
to come without the strength to triumph
don-t let your lifeline go
what do you see Where do we go One sign how do we grow
from the curses we uttered
and theres blood on the covers
its gonna be a Christmas to remember
its gonna be a Christmas to remember
taking our chances with (moments-old) ideas
and if we run and hit a hurdle
i don-t know no borders though
flowing open over oceans
have you ever flew in on a land the sun not coming down
all the birds through the bush see how the sound
never met a woman that I trust amp sorry but trust (is) just a must
its not like me Im more used to lust
ill always be here with you
im coming home to you
choice I can-t be alone
or just a heavenly fright Stick it Im tired Im bored Im trying so hard
the worst are the nights when its too raw
doesn-t mean your far enough to reach upon the stars
rise to the stars over the sea
rise to the stars over the sea
outcasts and liars fight over crumbs
better come with me
rap shit everyday now the name of

but look at the tears in my eyes
youll be adored you will have everything
forget your fears you will have everything
don-t fuck up the base
big Narstie said don-t fuck up the base
and this (is) far and away one of the hardest things that Ive ever done

but I think I found my miracle
but roads divide and new roads begin
people let me down

and no matter what weve lost
and I never know when Im holding you too much

a slave to the mundane
calm seas never shaped the greatest
but he kept hearing voices
an all-American boy
and machine hearts
who drill you diet you treat you like cattle use you (as) cannon fodder

driving through the lot finding different cars to drive out moving snow like
wrapped around the strands of red hair

to struggle and claw my way
not afraid
standing on the edge anticipating death of my pain

recording in the studio with rolled up marijuana
octagon fighting and swinging for at the stars
down in a hole
down in a hole
and ohh
and ohh
realizing Reality flaunted rough crimes
cuz it haunted my mind And made more tough times
through the trees
by the breeze
it only seems the more that I grieve
not the one that I lead
you have no word
you have no word
its straight genocide of my people and whats sadder
tell youths to stay in school research and manifest
like my undies
don-t give a fuck

i said twerk if you trynna eat good bitch x3
she on the floor takin in the last breath

all im sayin
stop me when Im (leavin-) but watching all the same
cocky and I diss you but watching all the same
im a femme queen Mother of the House of No Shame
im on my way Im on my way
to ski in the mothership
we all are programmed by the government
atomic artist
i hang with wifey and chronic growers sonic harvesters
only the brave dare to follow
unto the realm of tomorrow
the mystery tends to never wanna die
magicians appear to be in black and white
to think of her was to want her
i know that I was better (as) a loser
but its hard for me to see where ocean stops and where sky begins
every time I feel selfish ambition (is) taking my vision
that right here tonight
your riden
one time for the ones with data but no daddy
no shade see the view no canopy
if I had Edward Scissorhands hands
and accidentally injure every jam band
or any way you can take it
tonight im feeling im wasted we can make it
don-t wanna live here anymore
no take that ribbon out your hair that we can-t afford
i want her to see the butterflies flying in my chest
walk by a church seeing a sermon in prayer
but liquor makes me happy Im a mothafuckin monster
metropolis fight to survive flamin holocaust
clips loaded who wants it first protected here there almost every place u
hands up in the air tonight its my night to shine single ladies hmu on those
so when you think that you know it all and youre rushing to grow up
don-t alienate those that matter cause you might just push your luck
satisfy me
if you want me
and were burning daylight
the hour (is) getting late
when I least expected
could-ve melted
emotion too remaining
from a man from an Asian clan
i knew all about your plans
i really did understand
whos been fighting his demons
sharks that be fiending for some meat
im bored bored with you
life (is) cheap
i can take a few people but I need you to feature with me in a rap
i ain-t like some people who gotta be so damn crass
its deadly poisons writing your name
where hell and all evil will reign
life can try to beat it out of him
life can try to beat it out of him
i see him all the time every minute every hour
our love (is) like a lime sometimes sweet but mostly sour
know that youre the reason why
i dare to live My life
and all of the streets end when they don-t begin
i can never find I know I am never right
i grew when I saw every dream wouldn-t come true
finding out this isn-t you I went 10 0 miles in another-s shoes
its a strange course
its a strange course
too escape you bitch
lyrics
so let your flowers grow wild so you can show your child
i stole your tale because you told it to be quiet
would you believe that a woman used to belong to me Yup
u know the bus
i ain-t with the bull homie you can keep the BS
so that makes me so fresh and so clean
i dont know why man but I feel like somethin positive
and I wonder the matter the someone batter your heart a lot
about whos wrong or right when
about whos wrong or right when
thinking whyed I even stop
now Im walking in the dark
the destination the crossroads
the abyss to the earth to the waters
my wrist be so flutty
where the roots
see the little bird fly round his head
its said the winged in (post-mortal) visitation echo well
a protozoan evolved and grown who made a home a page of poems
nah I don-t think so
every time I broke down I said
never let me break down again
running in a race and Im going in like Usain Bolt
so please never let me slow
changes changes
so many things have changes
be like dat
can I be like dat
i think Im goin crazy
feelin like Im stuck in a maze
patterns Ive made before
don-t want you here no more
the only thing in gambling (is) weather to take miles b rips
rotovegas (is) where I keep my chips
and bring you a dozen roses everyday
youll be my breath of air
i don-t care if you love me
i don-t care if you love me
but whats the rush anyway
but whats the rush anyway
you got a problem admit it fix it and forget it
some men feel like they can fake it to make it
and his partner Smooth B

thunder in my mind
until the end of our time
its so wrong together

and it will take a little while to get back home
someone at a show
you made me love you
im a sucker for you
forget the rest of my troubles I need malt
its a fascist sport
to the darker sin
wait for the Spring
and I think that just like I did that corporations can do that
and They pumping people-s gas
lost my viriginity to a girl who didn-t like me much
i don-t hold grudges but I don-t pull punches
we do it over and over and over again

your face in broken pieces don-t you look down
academic Probation
weighin money like Damian
shining my mind stays writen like books on paper I keep on burning the papers
key to the gold chain I wear keep on walking on the moon stars on my back stay
im feeding off anger
drowning in the madness
but hang around this corner and sing the poor stranger blues
i would stay up North but theres nothing here that I can do
i was tryna vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti
she was tryna vroom vroom vroom like a Bugatti
your mom would probably get a heart attack if you came out the

a few patrons recognized us We started going through the pricelist
that they call hazel
and see her face in every passer by
i Couldn-T stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit
i mean they come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
who said nothing-s fair I say nows the time to take
i can feel it rising up again
still you poison the good thing with all of your lies
all right
and bust a move to the rhythm
use these haters on your back to energize your system
(is) this my 7 p m Is (is) my time to shine
or (is) writing and rehearsing these rhymes a waste of time
leave you in a house of wax like a museum figure deadened
on pin head a thin thread (is) what holds your life together

unhilt the black grimoire of death
glowing darkness keeps me warm

sick of being seen tired of these
while she-s faded
and this grade
then All I hear (is) gun shots

thats the way it should end
i done got so used to this just happens on the regular
forreal let me tell you whats regular Benz truck ain-t regular

when youll meet your maker
see the fire feel the pain
and she that first love she-s been since first touch

when deeds are measured in their act when thoughts are welcomes not attached
when one man-s dream becomes the truth and his opinion shapes the fact
and Ill lie again if it come to me now company and good company
they say life-s a bitch bitches like to fuck
then you chose to skate like a roller rink

when it all comes to light
we can call it a night

you were one of a kind
cause it all falls down
and it all falls down
in a blue sky
shiver and smile
in the sky I see us burn
follow me around the world
for a human body you see
for a human body you see
its over Im thankful there are no more sleepless nights
its over Im done cryin Im waving heartache goodbye
candy oceans and ice cream falls
and then lay on the floor
locked inside of you
which am I to you
good things come in 3-s like sides on an island
over the last year music-s taking over my life
if you like the way that guitar sounds
if youre pickin up what Im Puttin down
in the detail surrounding your death
you may one day need a few pieces yourself
sickly and ungracious you turn to dirt

if he was a girl could she be (as) evil (as) a boy
machines that make me breathe I just can-t stand their terrible scream

and louder than a microphone thats slightly near a lion-s den

and discuss your worth
or just cuss your words
ive got this gun in my hand
ive got this gun in my hand
and it can-t kill me
and it can-t kill me
he was calm
momma always told me to guard my heart
in my homegrown dojo I flow over labyrinths
backflipping (ad-libs) drop heat like blacksmiths
help of the helpless O abide with me
i triumph still if Thou Abide with me
and then someone told a story about something dead and gory
sweet nothing I made it up
cold cocked and shaking like a fist
cold cocked and shaking like a fist
into Nirvana

50k in my motor a couple mill in my safe
got a bankroll in my pocket heater on my waste
and when it falls beneath the mountaintops
and I will know only joy

after Ive shattered your mirrors forever
walking through genocidal remnants

not ashamed that I want you with me today back in my arms with me (is) where
whenever I leave you I can-t wait to get back to you youre like the link
roofs and the victorious army slaughtering all who resist making
in their darkened ruins the inhabitants have given way to the same

what my mind conceived (is) what my mind (is) bearing
first night of Biggest Loser boy ain-t nothing light
and with these bars I should be in a cell for life
for a precious few their lives are humble
their lives are humble
wearin my heart between my legs
and I shed a tear between my legs
on that day when I see my King
on that day when I see my King and death has lost its sting
but fuck that shit we scream anarchy out here
when the sex finished
estate of thoughts consigned
so what starts (is) a blush of mind
confusing me
breaking up (is) a heartache for me
dropping shells sit him right back down
life on mute won-t make no sound
then my music-s not for the streets
and when I rap you I want you hear every damn word that I speak
on and on
night with me
and please yourself at the same time
now if you don-t mind
i woke up with a start and a pounding heart gasping for air
suddenly I began to realize the eyes I did not recognize
and I paid enough attention with that last quote
but thats another song that never gets wrote
all falling a victim of wishing
but No nobody wanted to listen
black gold stuck to their veins
raking in money the evil to praise
ill fuck you if you take off your bracelet
got that opium and that angel
there are times in this world nothing makes sense but the dark
your world (is) falling apart
youth club me stiff rick and tones
thinking bout the days when bricks were phones
and if you wanna step to this
ya betta be the real thing
have I been fooled by wishes
have I been fooled by wishes
bliss Is this finally landing that first (kick-flip)
so you could be showing off representing the click
thats enough
thats enough
looking for a new sensation
just like your mother said you would ‘ 
she-s freakin out on glamour
i feel so romantic
behind excess stress and no caress this form of society (is)
cathedral the peasant the pope the hope of the people (is)
running out of time
take me for a ride
but then one day you came into my life
all my life I been waiting here fo ryou
i keep blowin down the road
makes me feel right at home
who said that you need to go and change
don-t listen to a word theyre saying
to conquer the world by your side
i had in mind
she saw my lips move but said it wasn-t loud enough
so she pulled me in just to turn me up

real talk ain-t nothing new like a thrift shop
nigga you don-t know the half life before this Hip Hop
fire-s gonna burn you back to me

with every beat of my heart its getting dark
its such a crush its getting hot
all I know you know I show you baby
through your head push to you baby
im lost in your love
please don-t hang up
im finding love in it like Southerners
woke up in my back car seat fucked up
the other 98 (is) stresses that the game bring
old fans that want me talk about the same thing
i go St Patrick pin me with the Medal of Freedom
the snakes moving through the Garden of Eden
i don-t need her
bitch think I love her
and ended way too soon
you walked into the room
unless It-s all about nutting
kei Shon Son
can you feel your heart beat racing
it doesn-t matter what you say
my whole life
behind
and we on and we on
and we on and we on
cause Im scared that this won-t be shared if I never wake up
but then you forget when you wake up
a mind full of haunted shadows
unlock the doors to forgotten fears
birth
the devil touched the cradle god gets his curse
open road
driving in my car damn near cut me off now youre in the fastlane so
i shouldn-t loved him
it really broke my heart to see you pushin that whip
you don-t understand it
when you should want to fix it
we can hit the rewind and do it all over again
lets do it all over again
while my cousins go to bed with their wives
and a small knife
a river of flowing fire
behold the stone with 7 eyes
the more things I need
in my fu (*) king world Ill never be free
look in your eyes and know just what you meant
i want to feel your love like the weather
its high time
she changed my mind
life drained from this house just like a virgin crime
cold nights Lives wasted away in the light

the gift that she gave was given to to be given away
tell me all of your good reasons tell me every word you say
these will never break me
over heels I can-t feel

and baby know I can feel it

and no shadow of a doubt
hopeless Ill stay always the coward constantly weigh all the things you
