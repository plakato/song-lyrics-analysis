Hallucinate, desegregate
Mediate, alleviate
Try not to hate
Love your mate
Don't suffocate on your own hate
Designate your love as fate
A one-world state as human freight
The number eight, a white black state
A gentle trait, the broken crate
A heavy weight or just too late?
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate
Now devastate, appreciate
Depreciate, fabricate
Emulate, the truth dilate
Special date, the animal we ate
Guilt debate, the edge serrate
A better rate, the youth irate
Deliberate, fascinate
Deviate, reinstate
Liberate to moderate
Recreate or detonate
Annihiliate, atomic fate
Mediate, clear the state
Activate, now radiate
A perfect state, food on plate
Gravitate, the Earth's own weight
Designate your love as fate
At ninety-eight we all rotate
Hallucinate, desegregate
Mediate, alleviate
Try not to hate, love your mate
Don't suffocate on your own hate
Designate your love as fate
A one world state as human freight
The number eight, a white black state
A gentle trait, the broken crate
A heavy weight or just too late
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate
Now devastate, appreciate
Depreciate, fabricate
Emulate, the truth dilate
Special date, the animals we ate
Guilt debate, the edge serrate
A better rate, the youth irate
Deliberate, fascinate
Deviate, reinstate
Liberate, to liberate
