a;Somewhere south of Winslow the road went right and I went left
a;Nothing out my window but desert, dirt, and death
b;From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air
b;Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear
c;Oh, I picked her up
d;Sure enough that girl was real, sitting in my truck
d;Said I know a place called the Broken Wheel where we can try our luck
e;Five miles north of 66, behind old man Lester's barn
f;Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sherriff claims that he
g;don't know

h;Oh, here I go again, singing
i;BANG BANG
h;That cell door's closing in
i;BANG BANG
h;Here I go again
i;BANG BANG
j;Those chains around my legs
i;BANG BANG
j;This is where the highway ends

k;4 AM I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear
k;I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear
l;Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes
m;When the door flew open - she came out screaming
n;DRIVE FOOL DRIVE

o;Oh, blue lights in my eyes
o;Oh, I must've been outta my mind

p;Here I go again
q;BANG BANG
