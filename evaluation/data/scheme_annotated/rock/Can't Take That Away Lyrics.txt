a;What can they all be thinking
b;Wanna' take the cross off of the hill
c;Put away the pledge of allegience
b;Lord,just the thought gives me a chill
d;They can take God off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it funny
e;How were all gonna see him on the judgement day
f;So sing it loud

g;One more time
h;Hear what you say
h;When you got the truth inside, now they can't take that away
g;One more time
h;Cause it ain't too late
h;Hold on to what you believe because they can't take that
h;They can't take that away

i;They want to change something somewhere for everybody
j;Right now a change ain't what we need
k;Just like my father's father before him
j;They held on with pride to everything they believed
l;They can take God off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it funny
m;How were all gonna see him on the judgement day

n;There's a fire that burns forever
o;Come a day we ain't gonna take no more
