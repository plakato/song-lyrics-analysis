a;There's an old man sitting on a front porch now
b;Talking about how it used to be
c;When I was young I was a hell of a man
c;My father died when I was ten
d;I hit the road to find a job
e;Had to feed my family
f;Times were hard my hands are still scarred
e;From the life I've had to lead
g;I was born to run
h;Drove a tractor and trailer all my life
h;Six kids and a hell of a wife
i;Made lots of money it all slipped away
i;A large family that's the price you pay
j;I always dreamed never gave up
j;Son, even when times got tough
k;That's when I'd push it a little bit more
k;You should've heard that engine roar

l;I was born to run
m;Can't slow down
n;No regrets, I've been blessed
l;Born to run
o;In time you'll see what the good Lord's done for me
l;Born to run
m;I can't slow down
n;No regrets, I did my best
l;Born to run
o;In time you'll see
o;What the good Lord's done, done for me

p;The old man, he passed away
q;And all he said never crossed my mind
p;Until I saw the price he payed
q;Was a lot like mine
p;I'm full and though it's miles away
q;Gotta hit the city right on time
q;And when I'm on I'll always sing little song of mine
r;I was born to run
