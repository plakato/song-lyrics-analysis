c;The first mistake is leave it up to somebody else
d;If you want something done you got to do it yourself
e;I'll do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me

e;Because nothing comes easy for a man like me
e;Everybody thinks the best things in life are free
e;If they would open their eyes it'd be so plain to see
e;That the best things in life don't come so easily

e;I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me
e;He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree
f;It would have been alright but he pushed me too far
f;If your looking for trouble step outside of this bar
e;IF it comes down to fisting, mister that ain't nothing new to me

e;You got to get your hands dirty when it's something that you really need
