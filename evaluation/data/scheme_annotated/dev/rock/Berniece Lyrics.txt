a;I can still remember I was eight years old
a;The first time that I picked her up little did I know
b;She's taken me to places that I've never been
c;Did my first gig in a rock-n-roll band

d;Berneice, sweet Berneice

e;Get a real job let the guitar go
e;There ain't no future in this rock-n-roll
f;So go for your guitars, go for your guns
f;Better think twice it's three against one
f;Take your best shot it's a showdown now

g;A guitar woman needs a guitar man
g;One without the other, neither one of them can stand
g;Remember where we came from we can do it all again
g;So thanks to all you people, give youselves a hand
