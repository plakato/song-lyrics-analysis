a;Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
a;Show me a woman that a man can trust
b;Snakes on the desert and fish in the sea
b;A rattlesnake mama made a sucker out of me

c;O tell me how long must I have to wait?
c;Can I get you now or must I hesitate?

d;Bacon to bacon and beans to beans
d;I got a cornbread mama in New Orleans
e;Turtles in the rivers, alligators in the swamp
e;A Louisiana mama keeps a man on the jump

f;O tell me how long must I have to wait...

f;It's beer to beer and ale to ale
f;I got a L.A. mama in the Frisco Jail
g;Gold in the mountains, copper in the hills
g;They caught my gal with a forty gallon still

f;O tell me how long must I have to wait...

h;Ham to ham and eggs to eggs
h;If I don't get a pension I'll have to beg
i;There's a lot of crooked politician men;
i;It would be all right if it wasn't for them

j;O tell me how long must I have to wait...

k;I tried to get a job all over town;
k;Seven hundred places they turned me down
l;They told me six weeks I could get relief
l;But I ain't got a bite to eat

m;O tell me how long must I have to wait...
