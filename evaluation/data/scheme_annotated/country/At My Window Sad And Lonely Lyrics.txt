a;At my window sad and lonely
a;Oftimes do I think of thee
b;Sad and lonely and I wonder
a;Do you ever think of me?

a;Every day is sad and lonely
c;Every day is sad and blue
a;Do you think of me my darling?
c;As you sail that ocean blue?

a;At my window sad and lonely
a;Stand and look across the sea
d;And I sad and lonely wonder
a;Do you ever think of me?

e;Will you find another sweetheart
f;In some far and distant land?
g;Sad and lonely now I wonder
f;If our boat will ever land

h;Ships may ply the stormy ocean
i;Planes may fly the stormy sky
j;Sad and lonely but remember
i;I will love you till I die
