g;Rolling undercover with aces high
h;You're never gonna find me no more

i;Then they sent me down south
j;To the Sunshine State
j;If you got a hostage, I negotiate
k;Can't tell ya' where I'm goin'
j;Be home late
l;You're never gonna find me now more

m;No, you're never gonna find me
m;Up Lookout Mountain down in Tennessee
n;Think I better cross that line
n;Leaving Chattanooga behind

m;Oh, hiding up yonder in Germany

o;I left Tunisia at the break of day

o;And I landed in the water down in Tampa Bay

m;No, you're never gonna find me
m;Up Lookout Mountain down in Tennessee
p;Think I better cross that line
p;Leaving Chattanooga behind
