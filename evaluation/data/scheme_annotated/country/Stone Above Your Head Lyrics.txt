a;Take your harvest from the soil
b;That is blacker than the color of the coal
c;But you're never gonna keep anything you try to reap
b;If you pull it from the dusty Georgia bowl

d;All the blossoms from the Magnolia
e;Have shriveled up and fallen to the ground
f;And I know I should have told you
e;That the rust was gonna tear your engine down

g;When the stone's above your head
h;And you're driving in the nails
i;When you're gone what kind of song are they gonna sing?
j;When the clay falls upon the pine
j;All that remains is what you leave behind
k;When you're lying with that stone above your head

k;Sit and listen, tune them in
k;Hear the trials and the hardships of my kin
l;Taken by the tones of the Cactus and the Rose
k;And the rhymes that Garry Stewart used to spin

m;All the easy people running to me
n;You can see their chickens running through the yard
o;Put them on the table every Sunday
n;Then they bow their heads and give thanks to the Lord
