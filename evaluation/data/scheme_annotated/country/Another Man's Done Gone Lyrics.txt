a;Two girls just give me a fountain pen
b;I think that's mighty nice
c;Reminds me of the joke where the girl
b;Give her daddy then pen about twice

d;I like the way she looks
e;Walks, talks, works, and lays
f;I got in trouble over her
e;And I'm I'm laying out days

g;If you must leave me, if you must leave me here
g;If you must leave me, if you must leave me here
g;Just leave a cigarette butt, leave a dime for beer

h;There's a doctor on my corner
i;Great big fat man awful stout
j;He makes me give him money
i;Just to take my baby out

k;I woke up every morning
l;With my woman in my arms
m;Good girl built like a government mule
l;And I'd not do her no harm

n;The women know me everywhere I land
n;The women know me everywhere I land
n;I got more little angels, than you'll find in the promised land

o;I'd like to have you around me
p;To wake me up every day
q;But when my main line comes back home
p;I wonder what she'll say

r;I got a reputation babe, from coast to coast
s;I don't have to tell you no lies
r;I don't have to lie nor boast

t;The women know me everywhere I land
t;The women know me everywhere I land
t;I got more little angels, than you'll find in the promised land
t;I got more little angels, than you'll find in the promised land
t;I got more little angels, than you'll find in the promised land
