a;It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
b;You went away, now my life is just a rainy day

c;And I love you so, how much you'll never know
d;You've gone away and left me lonely

e;Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me
f;Of a love so true
f;That it once turned all my gray skies blue

g;But you disappeared
g;Now my eyes are filled with tears
g;And I'm wishing you were here with me

h;Soaked with love are my thoughts of you
h;Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do

i;If only you were here
i;You'd wash away my tears
j;The sun would shine and once again
j;You'd be mine all mine

k;But in reality, you and I will never be
k;Cause you took your love away from me

l;Girl, I don't know what I did
m;To make you leave me but what I do know
n;Is that since you've been gone
o;There's such an emptiness inside
p;I'm wishing you'd come back to me

q;If only you were here
q;You'd wash away my tears
r;The sun would shine and once again
r;You'd be mine all mine

s;But in reality, you and I will never be
s;Cause you took your love away from me

s;Oh, baby, you took your love away from me
