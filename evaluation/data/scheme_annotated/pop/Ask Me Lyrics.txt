a;She takes another bath and she sprays her momma's perfume
b;To try to wipe away the scent he left behind
b;But it haunts her mind

c;You see she's his little rag, nothing more than just a waif
c;And he's mopping up his need, she is tired and afraid
d;Maybe she'll find a way through these awful years to disappear

e;Ask me if I think there's a God up in the heaven
f;Where did He go in the middle of her shame?

g;I see no mercy and no one down here's naming names
g;Nobody's naming names

g;Now she's looking in the mirror at a lovely woman face
g;No more frightened little girl, like she's gone without a trace
h;Still she leaves the light burning in the hall
h;It's hard to sleep at all

i;Still she crawls up in her bed acting quiet as a mouse
i;Deep inside she's listening for a creaking in the house
j;But noone's left to harm her, she's finally safe and sound
j;There's a peace she's found

k;Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the heaven
l;Where did He go in the middle of her shame?
