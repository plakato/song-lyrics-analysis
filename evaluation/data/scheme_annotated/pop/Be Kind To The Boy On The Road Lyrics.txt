a;Who is that boy on the white winding highway?
b;Why does he roam alone?
a;Is he looking for life on that white winding highway?
b;For his parents dealt him trouble at home

a;You might think he's wrong standing there on that highway
c;O' what a foolish young lad!
a;But you yourself might be standing on that highway
c;If you'd had his troubles on your hands

a;Don't point your finger at that boy on the highway
d;As you travel down this road!
e;Either give him your help or pass him with kindness
d;Cause he's got all the trouble that he wants!

f;Your policeman discourages that boy on the highway
g;It's heard everywhere that he goes!
f;But the best way to help that boy on the highway
g;Is to fix all your troubles there at home!

h;I've heard it said 'bout rolling stone boys
i;They gather no moss in their life?
j;I'll tell you the bee that gets the honey
i;Ain't the bee that hands around the hive

j;Oh be kind to that boy on that white winding highway
k;As you travel on there alone
l;Remember the men that wrote your Bible
k;Are the men who gave up their homes!
