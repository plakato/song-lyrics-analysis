a;Here I sit all by myself
a;Wondering how she could put our love on a shelf
b;A crowd of people, they pass me by
b;But all I can do is hang my head and cry

c;Blame it on a sad song in the night
c;I don't want anyone but you to make it right
c;Blame it on a sad song in the night
d;Well, it's an old familiar feeling
d;Girl, it's got my heart reeling
c;Don't want to hear a sad song in the night
e;Anymore

f;I know when we first started out
f;I was your only love and you had no doubt
g;But songs of the heart don't last forever
g;But don't you give up on love cause you never say never

h;Cause not a day goes by that I don't think about you
i;Oh, moment to moment, I get lost in time
j;And many years from now when I hear that song come on the radio
k;All those feelings will come back to haunt me
j;My heart will let me know

l;Blame it on a sad song
m;You can blame it on a sad song, baby
l;Blame it on, blame it on a sad song
