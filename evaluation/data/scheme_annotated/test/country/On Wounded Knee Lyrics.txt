a;Back of the napkin scratch out
b;The words that I've learned
c;But they don't come, just cracks and hums
b;Like nothing I've ever heard
d;No place to stay, no fire or rain
e;No number or ratio
f;No gauge to give a warning sign

g;I guess we all should have known
h;What the downside might be
i;As we swore and prayed and stood and gazed
h;At some beast we never did see
j;Coming winter's chill in Charlottesville
k;With no leg to stand on
l;That's about where I draw the line

m;Scrape off the time elapse
m;Push myself right up to the collapse
n;Will you know me when I'm down on wounded knee?

o;Well the blood ran down and covered up
p;Everyone I've ever known
q;Mangled hands and best laid plans
p;My my haven't we grown
r;Back to the mirrors where we can't hear
p;The screams and shouts below
s;I tell you boys it's about time

t;There are high towers and deep wells
t;There are strokes and heart attacks and spells
u;Will you know me when I'm down on wounded knee?
