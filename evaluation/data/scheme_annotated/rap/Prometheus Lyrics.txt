a; Cas One
b;They want fire? Well let em burn
b;Ashes in my urn, past the passion of my work
b;Like the passage of my journey made me a new Earth
c;Fill it all to fill my cup and I won't ever give it up
d;A man of wounds and cuts, reshaped, and made new
e;And I paid dues with worn shoes walking on the lava
f;Like no longer am I ever on or past the pity parties
f;Fire in my arteries, make the world a part of me
g;Vice versa, line the words that take the curtain off the person
h;Feeling certain they determine won't burn up
i;Oh, ain't no quitter in my go-getter
j;Switch-hitter, bitter pill swallowed, I know, I know
j;I won't ever go home
j;Made my suit of armor out the road
j;Now I feel there ain't nowhere else to go
j;All the pieces of my soul got a reason that they glow
j;I'm a phoenix in the snow, these chains will never hold

k; Bodi &amp; Cas One
l;Take the dark out the light
l;Bring a fire to the night
l;Let the demons dance, I'm never giving up the fight
l;If it's wrong make it right
l;Til I'm gone I'll ignite
m;An inferno in my eyes and it's never gonna die

n; Bodi
o;I've only got two options
p;Keep walking or dream on watching
p;As the world pass by and I'm sitting here talking
q;About a change coming, it won't if I'm
p;stopping
r;Ain't no time to reload
s;It's a one shot deal, kid, welcome to
t;the show
u;Used to go victimize bruises and lumps
u;And, stand there lookin off the cliff like jump
v;But when the camera roll go flicker
v;Better make the most of the final motion picture
w;No time to waste bein pissed at the cards I was dealt
w;Blamin others for the scars I felt
w;Part of myself hid the belt, givin welts
w;Burned without seeing other hearts I melt
x;Cheating ex-girlfriends the reason I got no trust
x;People doubting me the reason I got no guts
y;And no glory but the stories mine
z;alone
z;I can revise it fore I write it in stone
z;Fire, re-ignite it, light the path shown
z;Walk among the constellation map til I'm back home
aa;Backbone's no stronger through the slouching
aa;Head hangin, finger pointin, or the doubting
ab;So what you sittin on? What you aimin at?
ab;Fate's trapped and it's my turn to take it back

ac;If I can't make it out alive
ac;Then I will leave it all behind
ac;And hold my head and chin up high
ac;Until the day I waive goodbye
ac;And fade into the other side
ac;And find a final piece of mind
ac;My fears will never be my guide
ac;And I will never hide

ad; Bodi
ae;So let's strip away the bones and the skin
ae;And the old jaded grin
af;And the grim simple truth that I won't begin again
ag;And win or lose don't matter none, when it's all said and done
ag;The breath in the lungs, and steps that I've run
ag;Go up and away, and set with the sun
ah;I'm left with the one thing left to decide
ai;What type of man I've become and soul that I was
aj;Can hold to a grudge or shoulder and trudge
ak;A molder of boulder til run out of blood
ak;But I ain't waiting for the perfect shot
al;Draw, fire, aim, til the fucking
am;wheels fall off

an; Cas One
an;And the deal's all off, kid, built the house alone
an;Cross my motherfucking bones on that long walk home
an;No thrones, no hopes, no idea where the story goes
an;Skeletons on my road journey got some soul
ao;Behold that pale horse that burns the house down
ao;The ghost of my former self now, kneel down
ao;For the world now, like the motherfucking crowns
ao;Got pushed down the queen's mouth, bleed on out
