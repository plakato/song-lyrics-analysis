a;I will never glorify they names
a;The cloth from which I came
a;Is dampened w blood, sweat, &amp; most of all the pain
a;Cause I been pre-approved, my soul been rearranged
a;Since I had been detained

b;All my niggas they can vibe to this &amp; all the women they can ride to
c;this

d;Catching the vibes, hands to the sky, beautiful clouds
d;Ain't talked to God in so long, I'm prolly hell bound
d;Spitting fire w my dogs, like we hell hounds
d;I haven't been the same ever since I moved out my hometown
d;Still profound w pronouns
e;Trying to bloom in the darkest of rooms
e;Bringing light to my situation w the darkest of tunes
e;These ain't even tracks, just a compilation of moods
e;Every day wishing we never see our face in the news
e;Tryna decide whether it's worth it, if we win or we lose
e;Never feeling a feeling, unless I'm feeling confused
e;What do you choose, freedom or shoes, life in the nude

f;All my niggas they can vibe to this &amp; all the women they can ride to
g;this
