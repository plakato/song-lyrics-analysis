a; Bodi
b;I was 8 years old when I first killed a man
b;It was either me or him with machete in my hand
b;I'd tell you more but you wouldn't understand
b;A grown man once a lost boy of Sudan
b;Who ran past the devil's lines drawn in the sand
b;And god never had a part in the plan
b;.Saw the sky fall on my own land
c;Never learned to crawl before I had to stand up and run
d;On horseback they came to my village
d;Killed dad, raped mom, looted and pillaged
e;Held a gun to my sister and said that they'd shoot
f;If I didn't join their cause as a troop, so
g;What could I do? I remained loyal
f;As we moved north where someone had oil
h;They kept saying that the enemy was them
i;Khartoum, UN, JEM, but
j;All I wanted to do was survive
j;And one day see my little sister's shining eyes
j;So I die on this side of the knife
j;And that's lifeâ€¦

n; Dice
o;Happy family, I remember my siblings and how we play
o;There was so much love til my daddy passed away
o;That's when mommy changed, sad mommy stayed
o;Crying all day, yelling with her voice raised
p;Drunk in a daze eyes glazed, lost in deep thought
q;Sold me to a strange man just to pay the lease off
r;Beaten and raped by any who payed the three bucks
r;They hurt me mommy, burnt me mommy, left me locked
s;Sold my body, lost my soul, forgot free thought
s;One after another, disease and suffering please god
s;Take this pain away, this is not the life I want
s;I'd rather die here than lie here with these Johns
t;My clothes tattered, my spirit broke shattered
t;No man alive can save me from what has happened
t;Police captains take no action
u;Pockets have been fattened, American greed has them
v;I miss you mommy
u;Will anyone ever love me again?

w; Bodi
x;Six months old in the slums of Kibera
y;But wait - let me paint it clearer
z;Millions like me living in tents
z;Paper bag bathrooms thrown across the fence
aa;An orphan - both parents in the grave
ab;Mom and dad both victims of AIDS
ac;I never knew em but their blood is in me
ac;Fate sewn closed spelled HIV
ad;A woman with a heart as big as the ocean
ad;And the sun took me in, made her house open
ad;To me and thirty kids in the same position
ad;Die to make a livin in the only conditions
ae;We've ever known, never shown any sad tears
ae;Truth is I'm thankful just to be here
af;Even if the odds are I won't make it
af;To 10, for granted, my time I'll never take it
ag;And when the end comes with a smile and a nod
ag;Is how I'll reunite with my parents and god
ah;My name's Kefa, this is my story
ah;You may forget me, but please don't ignore me
