AUTHOR Samuel Taylor Coleridge

TITLE The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

RHYME a b c b 

    It is an ancyent Marinere,
      And he stoppeth one of three:
    "By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye
      "Now wherefore stoppest me?

RHYME a b c b 

    "The Bridegroom's doors are open'd wide
      "And I am next of kin;
    "The Guests are met, the Feast is set,--
      "May'st hear the merry din.--

RHYME a b c b 

    But still he holds the wedding-guest--
      There was a Ship, quoth he--
    "Nay, if thou'st got a laughsome tale,
      "Marinere! come with me."

RHYME a b c b 

    He holds him with his skinny hand,
      Quoth he, there was a Ship--
    "Now get thee hence, thou grey-beard Loon!
      "Or my Staff shall make thee skip."

RHYME a b c b 

    He holds him with his glittering eye--
      The wedding guest stood still
    And listens like a three year's child;
      The Marinere hath his will.

RHYME a b c b 

    The wedding-guest sate on a stone,
      He cannot chuse but hear:
    And thus spake on that ancyent man,
      The bright-eyed Marinere.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Ship was cheer'd, the Harbour clear'd--
      Merrily did we drop
    Below the Kirk, below the Hill,
      Below the Light-house top.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Sun came up upon the left,
      Out of the Sea came he:
    And he shone bright, and on the right
      Went down into the Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

   Higher and higher every day,
      Till over the mast at noon--
    The wedding-guest here beat his breast,
      For he heard the loud bassoon.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Bride hath pac'd into the Hall,
      Red as a rose is she;
    Nodding their heads before her goes
      The merry Minstralsy.

RHYME a b c b 

    The wedding-guest he beat his breast,
      Yet he cannot chuse but hear:
    And thus spake on that ancyent Man,
      The bright-eyed Marinere.

RHYME a b c b 

    Listen, Stranger! Storm and Wind,
      A Wind and Tempest strong!
    For days and weeks it play'd us freaks--
      Like Chaff we drove along.

RHYME a b c b 

    Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow,
      And it grew wond'rous cauld:
    And Ice mast-high came floating by
      As green as Emerauld.

RHYME a b c b 

    And thro' the drifts the snowy clifts
      Did send a dismal sheen;
    Ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken--
      The Ice was all between.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Ice was here, the Ice was there,
      The Ice was all around:
    It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd--
      Like noises of a swound.

RHYME a b c b 

    At length did cross an Albatross,
      Thorough the Fog it came;
    And an it were a Christian Soul,
      We hail'd it in God's name.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms,
      And round and round it flew:
    The Ice did split with a Thunder-fit;
      The Helmsman steer'd us thro'.

RHYME a b c b 

    And a good south wind sprung up behind,
      The Albatross did follow;
    And every day for food or play
      Came to the Marinere's hollo!

RHYME a b c b 

    In mist or cloud on mast or shroud
      It perch'd for vespers nine,
    Whiles all the night thro' fog-smoke white
      Glimmer'd the white moon-shine.

RHYME a b c b 

    "God save thee, ancyent Marinere!
      "From the fiends that plague thee thus--
    "Why look'st thou so?"--with my cross bow
      I shot the Albatross.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Sun came up upon the right,
      Out of the Sea came he;
    And broad as a weft upon the left
      Went down into the Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

    And the good south wind still blew behind,
      But no sweet Bird did follow
    Ne any day for food or play
      Came to the Marinere's hollo!

RHYME a b c b 

    And I had done an hellish thing
      And it would work 'em woe:
    For all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird
      That made the Breeze to blow.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    Ne dim ne red, like God's own head,
      The glorious Sun uprist:
    Then all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird
      That brought the fog and mist.
    'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay
      That bring the fog and mist.

RHYME a b c b 

    The breezes blew, the white foam flew,
      The furrow follow'd free:
    We were the first that ever burst
      Into that silent Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

    Down dropt the breeze, the Sails dropt down,
      'Twas sad as sad could be
    And we did speak only to break
      The silence of the Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

    All in a hot and copper sky
      The bloody sun at noon,
    Right up above the mast did stand,
      No bigger than the moon.

RHYME a b c b 

    Day after day, day after day,
      We stuck, ne breath ne motion,
    As idle as a painted Ship
      Upon a painted Ocean.

RHYME a b c b 

    Water, water, every where
      And all the boards did shrink;
    Water, water, every where,
      Ne any drop to drink.

RHYME a b c b 

    The very deeps did rot: O Christ!
      That ever this should be!
    Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
      Upon the slimy Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

    About, about, in reel and rout
      The Death-fires danc'd at night;
    The water, like a witch's oils,
      Burnt green and blue and white.

RHYME a b c b 

    And some in dreams assured were
      Of the Spirit that plagued us so:
    Nine fathom deep he had follow'd us
      From the Land of Mist and Snow.

RHYME a b c b 

    And every tongue thro' utter drouth
      Was wither'd at the root;
    We could not speak no more than if
      We had been choked with soot.

RHYME a b c b 

    Ah wel-a-day! what evil looks
      Had I from old and young;
    Instead of the Cross the Albatross
      About my neck was hung.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    I saw a something in the Sky	
      No bigger than my fist;		
    At first it seem'd a little speck	
      And then it seem'd a mist:	
    It mov'd and mov'd, and took at last
      A certain shape, I wist.		
      
RHYME a b c b 

    A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!	
      And still it ner'd and ner'd;	
    And, an it dodg'd a water-sprite,	
      It plung'd and tack'd and veer'd.

RHYME a b c c b 

    With throat unslack'd, with black lips bak'd
      Ne could we laugh, ne wail:
    Then while thro' drouth all dumb they stood
    I bit my arm and suck'd the blood
      And cry'd, A sail! a sail!

RHYME a b c c b 

    With throat unslack'd, with black lips bak'd
      Agape they hear'd me call:
    Gramercy! they for joy did grin
    And all at once their breath drew in
      As they were drinking all.

RHYME a b a b 

    She doth not tack from side to side--
      Hither to work us weal
    Withouten wind, withouten tide
      She steddies with upright keel.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    The western wave was all a flame,
      The day was well nigh done!
    Almost upon the western wave
      Rested the broad bright Sun;
    When that strange shape drove suddenly
      Betwixt us and the Sun.

RHYME a b c b 

    And strait the Sun was fleck'd with bars
      (Heaven's mother send us grace)
    As if thro' a dungeon grate he peer'd
      With broad and burning face.

RHYME a b c b 

    Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
      How fast she neres and neres!
    Are those _her_ Sails that glance in the Sun
      Like restless gossameres?

RHYME a b c b 

    Are these _her_ naked ribs, which fleck'd
      The sun that did behind them peer?
    And are these two all, all the crew,
      That woman and her fleshless Pheere?

RHYME a b c c b 

    _His_ bones were black with many a crack,
      All black and bare, I ween;
    Jet-black and bare, save where with rust
    Of mouldy damps and charnel crust
      They're patch'd with purple and green.

RHYME a b a a b 

    _Her_ lips are red, _her_ looks are free,
      _Her_ locks are yellow as gold:
    Her skin is as white as leprosy,
    And she is far liker Death than he;
      Her flesh makes the still air cold.

RHYME a b c b 

    The naked Hulk alongside came
      And the Twain were playing dice;
    "The Game is done! I've won, I've won!"
      Quoth she, and whistled thrice.

RHYME a b c b 

    A gust of wind sterte up behind
      And whistled thro' his bones;
    Thro' the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth
      Half-whistles and half-groans.

RHYME a b a a b 

    With never a whisper in the Sea
      Off darts the Spectre-ship;
    While clombe above the Eastern bar
    The horned Moon, with one bright Star
      Almost atween the tips.

RHYME a b c b 

    One after one by the horned Moon
      (Listen, O Stranger! to me)
    Each turn'd his face with a ghastly pang
      And curs'd me with his ee.

RHYME a b c b 

    Four times fifty living men,
      With never a sigh or groan,
    With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
      They dropp'd down one by one.

RHYME a b a b 

    Their souls did from their bodies fly,--
      They fled to bliss or woe;
    And every soul it pass'd me by,
      Like the whiz of my Cross-bow.

RHYME a b c b 

    "I fear thee, ancyent Marinere!
      "I fear thy skinny hand;
    "And thou art long and lank and brown
      "As is the ribb'd Sea-sand.

RHYME a b c b 

    "I fear thee and thy glittering eye
      "And thy skinny hand so brown"--
    Fear not, fear not, thou wedding guest!
      This body dropt not down.

RHYME a b c b 

    Alone, alone, all all alone
      Alone on the wide wide Sea;
    And Christ would take no pity on
      My soul in agony.

RHYME a b c b 

    The many men so beautiful,
      And they all dead did lie!
    And a million million slimy things
      Liv'd on--and so did I.

RHYME a b c b 

    I look'd upon the rotting Sea,
      And drew my eyes away;
    I look'd upon the eldritch deck,
      And there the dead men lay.

RHYME a b c b 

    I look'd to Heaven, and try'd to pray;
      But or ever a prayer had gusht,
    A wicked whisper came and made
      My heart as dry as dust.

RHYME a b c c c 

    I clos'd my lids and kept them close,
      Till the balls like pulses beat;
    For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
    Lay like a load on my weary eye,
      And the dead were at my feet.

RHYME a b c b 

    The cold sweat melted from their limbs,
      Ne rot, ne reek did they;
    The look with which they look'd on me,
      Had never pass'd away.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    An orphan's curse would drag to Hell
      A spirit from on high:
    But O! more horrible than that
      Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
    Seven days, seven nights I saw that curse
      And yet I could not die.

RHYME a b c b 

    The moving Moon went up the sky
      And no where did abide:
    Softly she was going up
      And a star or two beside--

RHYME a b c c b 

    Her beams bemock'd the sultry main
      Like morning frosts yspread;
    But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
    The charmed water burnt alway
      A still and awful red.

RHYME a b c c b 

    Beyond the shadow of the ship
      I watch'd the water-snakes:
    They mov'd in tracks of shining white;
    And when they rear'd, the elfish light
      Fell off in hoary flakes.

RHYME a b c c b 

    Within the shadow of the ship
      I watch'd their rich attire:
    Blue, glossy green, and velvet black
    They coil'd and swam; and every track
      Was a flash of golden fire.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    O happy living things! no tongue
      Their beauty might declare:
    A spring of love gusht from my heart,
      And I bless'd them unaware!
    Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
      And I bless'd them unaware.

RHYME a b c b 

    The self-same moment I could pray;
      And from my neck so free
    The Albatross fell off, and sank
      Like lead into the sea.

RHYME a b c c b 

    O sleep, it is a gentle thing
      Belov'd from pole to pole!
    To Mary-queen the praise be yeven
    She sent the gentle sleep from heaven
      That slid into my soul.

RHYME a b c b 

    The silly buckets on the deck
      That had so long remain'd,
    I dreamt that they were fill'd with dew
      And when I awoke it rain'd.

RHYME a b c b 

    My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
      My garments all were dank;
    Sure I had drunken in my dreams
      And still my body drank.

RHYME a b c b 

    I mov'd and could not feel my limbs,
      I was so light, almost
    I thought that I had died in sleep,
      And was a blessed Ghost.

RHYME a b c b 

    The roaring wind! it roar'd far off,
      It did not come anear;
    But with its sound it shook the sails
      That were so thin and sere.

RHYME a b c c b 

    The upper air bursts into life,
      And a hundred fire-flags sheen
    To and fro they are hurried about;
    And to and fro, and in and out
      The stars dance on between.

RHYME a b a b 

    The coming wind doth roar more loud;
      The sails do sigh, like sedge:
    The rain pours down from one black cloud
      And the Moon is at its edge.

RHYME a b c c b 

    Hark! hark! the thick black cloud is cleft,
      And the Moon is at its side:
    Like waters shot from some high crag,
    The lightning falls with never a jag
      A river steep and wide.

RHYME a b c b 

    The strong wind reach'd the ship: it roar'd
      And dropp'd down, like a stone!
    Beneath the lightning and the moon
      The dead men gave a groan.

RHYME a b c b 

    They groan'd, they stirr'd, they all uprose,
      Ne spake, ne mov'd their eyes:
    It had been strange, even in a dream
      To have seen those dead men rise.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    The helmsman steerd, the ship mov'd on;
      Yet never a breeze up-blew;
    The Marineres all 'gan work the ropes,
      Where they were wont to do:
    They rais'd their limbs like lifeless tools--
      We were a ghastly crew.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    The body of my brother's son
      Stood by me knee to knee:
    The body and I pull'd at one rope,
      But he said nought to me--
    And I quak'd to think of my own voice
      How frightful it would be!

RHYME a b c b 

    The day-light dawn'd--they dropp'd their arms,
      And cluster'd round the mast:
    Sweet sounds rose slowly thro' their mouths
      And from their bodies pass'd.

RHYME a b c b 

    Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
      Then darted to the sun:
    Slowly the sounds came back again
      Now mix'd, now one by one.

RHYME a b c c b 

    Sometimes a dropping from the sky
      I heard the Lavrock sing;
    Sometimes all little birds that are
    How they seem'd to fill the sea and air
      With their sweet jargoning,

RHYME a b c b 

    And now 'twas like all instruments,
      Now like a lonely flute;
    And now it is an angel's song
      That makes the heavens be mute.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    It ceas'd: yet still the sails made on
      A pleasant noise till noon,
    A noise like of a hidden brook
      In the leafy month of June,
    That to the sleeping woods all night
      Singeth a quiet tune.

RHYME a b c b 

    Listen, O listen, thou Wedding-guest!
      "Marinere! thou hast thy will:
    "For that, which comes out of thine eye, doth make
      "My body and soul to be still."

RHYME a b c b 

    Never sadder tale was told
      To a man of woman born:
    Sadder and wiser thou wedding-guest!
      Thou'lt rise to morrow morn.

RHYME a b c b 

    Never sadder tale was heard
      By a man of woman born:
    The Marineres all return'd to work
      As silent as beforne.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Marineres all 'gan pull the ropes,
      But look at me they n'old:
    Thought I, I am as thin as air--
      They cannot me behold.

RHYME a b c b 

    Till moon we silently sail'd on
      Yet never a breeze did breathe:
    Slowly and smoothly went the ship
      Mov'd onward from beneath.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    Under the keel nine fathom deep
      From the land of mist and snow
    The spirit slid: and it was He
      That made the Ship to go.
    The sails at noon left off their tune
      And the Ship stood still also.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    The sun right up above the mast
      Had fix'd her to the ocean:
    But in a minute she 'gan stir
      With a short uneasy motion--
    Backwards and forwards half her length
      With a short uneasy motion.

RHYME a b c b 

    Then, like a pawing horse let go,
      She made a sudden bound:
    It flung the blood into my head,
      And I fell into a swound.

RHYME a b c c b 

    How long in that same fit I lay,
      I have not to declare;
    But ere my living life return'd,
    I heard and in my soul discern'd
      Two voices in the air,

RHYME a b c b 

    "Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?
      "By him who died on cross,
    "With his cruel bow he lay'd full low
      "The harmless Albatross.

RHYME a b c b 

    "The spirit who 'bideth by himself
      "In the land of mist and snow,
    "He lov'd the bird that lov'd the man
      "Who shot him with his bow."

RHYME a b c b 

    The other was a softer voice,
      As soft as honey-dew:
    Quoth he the man hath penance done,
      And penance more will do.

RHYME a b c b 

    "But tell me, tell me! speak again,
      "Thy soft response renewing--
    "What makes that ship drive on so fast?
      "What is the Ocean doing?"

RHYME a b c b 

    "Still as a Slave before his Lord,
      "The Ocean hath no blast:
    "His great bright eye most silently
      "Up to the moon is cast--

RHYME a b c b 

    "If he may know which way to go,
      "For she guides him smooth or grim.
    "See, brother, see! how graciously
      "She looketh down on him."

RHYME a b c b 

    "But why drives on that ship so fast
      "Withouten wave or wind?"
    "The air is cut away before,
      "And closes from behind.

RHYME a b c b 

    "Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high,
      "Or we shall be belated:
    "For slow and slow that ship will go,
      "When the Marinere's trance is abated."

RHYME a b c b 

    I woke, and we were sailing on
      As in a gentle weather:
    'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
      The dead men stood together.

RHYME a b c b 

    All stood together on the deck,
      For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
    All fix'd on me their stony eyes
      That in the moon did glitter.

RHYME a b c b 

    The pang, the curse, with which they died,
      Had never pass'd away:
    I could not draw my een from theirs
      Ne turn them up to pray.

RHYME a b c b 

    And in its time the spell was snapt,
      And I could move my een:
    I look'd far-forth, but little saw
      Of what might else be seen.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    Like one, that on a lonely road
      Doth walk in fear and dread,
    And having once turn'd round, walks on
      And turns no more his head:
    Because he knows, a frightful fiend
      Doth close behind him tread.

RHYME a b c b 

    But soon there breath'd a wind on me,
      Ne sound ne motion made:
    Its path was not upon the sea
      In ripple or in shade.

RHYME a b c b 

    It rais'd my hair, it fann'd my cheek,
      Like a meadow-gale of spring--
    It mingled strangely with my fears,
      Yet it felt like a welcoming.

RHYME a b c b 

    Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
      Yet she sail'd softly too:
    Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--
      On me alone it blew.

RHYME a b c b 

    O dream of joy! is this indeed
      The light-house top I see?
    Is this the Hill? Is this the Kirk?
      Is this mine own countree?

RHYME a b c b 

    We drifted o'er the Harbour-bar,
      And I with sobs did pray--
    "O let me be awake, my God!
      "Or let me sleep alway!"

RHYME a b c b 

    The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
      So smoothly it was strewn!
    And on the bay the moon light lay,
      And the shadow of the moon.

RHYME a b c b 

    The moonlight bay was white all o'er,
      Till rising from the same,
    Full many shapes, that shadows were,
      Like as of torches came.

RHYME a b c b 

    A little distance from the prow
      Those dark-red shadows were;
    But soon I saw that my own flesh
      Was red as in a glare.

RHYME a b c b 

    I turn'd my head in fear and dread,
      And by the holy rood,
    The bodies had advanc'd, and now
      Before the mast they stood.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    They lifted up their stiff right arms,
      They held them strait and tight;
    And each right-arm burnt like a torch,
      A torch that's borne upright.
    Their stony eye-balls glitter'd on
      In the red and smoky light.

RHYME a b a b 

    I pray'd and turn'd my head away
      Forth looking as before.
    There was no breeze upon the bay,
      No wave against the shore.

RHYME a b a b 

    The rock shone bright, the kirk no less
      That stands above the rock:
    The moonlight steep'd in silentness
      The steady weathercock.

RHYME a b c b 

    And the bay was white with silent light,
      Till rising from the same
    Full many shapes, that shadows were,
      In crimson colours came.

RHYME a b c b 

    A little distance from the prow
      Those crimson shadows were:
    I turn'd my eyes upon the deck--
      O Christ! what saw I there?

RHYME a b c b 

    Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat;
      And by the Holy rood
    A man all light, a seraph-man,
      On every corse there stood.

RHYME a b c b 

    This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand:
      It was a heavenly sight:
    They stood as signals to the land,
      Each one a lovely light:

RHYME a b c b 

    This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand,
      No voice did they impart--
    No voice; but O! the silence sank,
      Like music on my heart.

RHYME a b c b 

    Eftsones I heard the dash of oars,
      I heard the pilot's cheer:
    My head was turn'd perforce away
      And I saw a boat appear.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    Then vanish'd all the lovely lights;
      The bodies rose anew:
    With silent pace, each to his place,
      Came back the ghastly crew.
    The wind, that shade nor motion made,
      On me alone it blew.

RHYME a b a b 

    The pilot, and the pilot's boy
      I heard them coming fast:
    Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy,
      The dead men could not blast.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    I saw a third--I heard his voice:
      It is the Hermit good!
    He singeth loud his godly hymns
      That he makes in the wood.
    He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
      The Albatross's blood.

RHYME a b c c b 

    This Hermit good lives in that wood
      Which slopes down to the Sea.
    How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
    He loves to talk with Marineres
      That come from a far Contree.

RHYME a b c b 

    He kneels at morn and noon and eve--
      He hath a cushion plump:
    It is the moss, that wholly hides
      The rotted old Oak-stump.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Skiff-boat ne'rd: I heard them talk,
      "Why, this is strange, I trow!
    "Where are those lights so many and fair
      "That signal made but now?

RHYME a b c b d b 

    "Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said--
      "And they answer'd not our cheer.
    "The planks look warp'd, and see those sails
      "How thin they are and sere!
    "I never saw aught like to them
      "Unless perchance it were

RHYME a b c c b 

    "The skeletons of leaves that lag
      "My forest brook along:
    "When the Ivy-tod is heavy with snow,
    "And the Owlet whoops to the wolf below
      "That eats the she-wolf's young.

RHYME a b c b 

    "Dear Lord! it has a fiendish look"--
      (The Pilot made reply)
    "I am a-fear'd.--"Push on, push on!"
      Said the Hermit cheerily.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Boat came closer to the Ship,
      But I ne spake ne stirr'd!
    The Boat came close beneath the Ship,
      And strait a sound was heard!

RHYME a b c b 

    Under the water it rumbled on,
      Still louder and more dread:
    It reach'd the Ship, it split the bay;
      The Ship went down like lead.

RHYME a b a b a b 

    Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,
      Which sky and ocean smote:
    Like one that hath been seven days drown'd
      My body lay afloat:
    But, swift as dreams, myself I found
      Within the Pilot's boat.

RHYME a b c b 

    Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,
      The boat spun round and round:
    And all was still, save that the hill
      Was telling of the sound.

RHYME a b c b 

    I mov'd my lips: the Pilot shriek'd
      And fell down in a fit.
    The Holy Hermit rais'd his eyes
      And pray'd where he did sit.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
      Who now doth crazy go,
    Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while
      His eyes went to and fro,
    "Ha! ha!" quoth he--"full plain I see,
      "The devil knows how to row."

RHYME a b c b 

    And now all in mine own Countree
      I stood on the firm land!
    The Hermit stepp'd forth from the boat,
      And scarcely he could stand.

RHYME a b c b 

    "O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy Man!"
      The Hermit cross'd his brow--
    "Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say
      "What manner man art thou?"

RHYME a b c b 

    Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd
      With a woeful agony,
    Which forc'd me to begin my tale
      And then it left me free.

RHYME a b c b 

    Since then at an uncertain hour,
      Now oftimes and now fewer,
    That anguish comes and makes me tell
      My ghastly aventure.

RHYME a b c c b 

    I pass, like night, from land to land;
      I have strange power of speech;
    The moment that his face I see
      I know the man that must hear me;
      To him my tale I teach.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    What loud uproar bursts from that door!
      The Wedding-guests are there;
    But in the Garden-bower the Bride
      And Bride-maids singing are:
    And hark the little Vesper-bell
      Which biddeth me to prayer.

RHYME a b c b 

    O Wedding-guest! this soul hath been
      Alone on a wide wide sea:
    So lonely 'twas, that God himself
      Scarce seemed there to be.

RHYME a b c b 

    O sweeter than the Marriage-feast,
      'Tis sweeter far to me
    To walk together to the Kirk
      With a goodly company.

RHYME a b c c b 

    To walk together to the Kirk
      And all together pray,
    While each to his great father bends,
    Old men, and babes, and loving friends,
      And Youths, and Maidens gay.

RHYME a b a b 

    Farewell, farewell! but this I tell
      To thee, thou wedding-guest!
    He prayeth well who loveth well
      Both man and bird and beast.

RHYME a b c b 

    He prayeth best who loveth best,
      All things both great and small:
    For the dear God, who loveth us,
      He made and loveth all.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Marinere, whose eye is bright,
      Whose beard with age is hoar,
    Is gone; and now the wedding-guest
      Turn'd from the bridegroom's door.

RHYME a b c b 

    He went, like one that hath been stunn'd
      And is of sense forlorn:
    A sadder and a wiser man
      He rose the morrow morn.

TITLE Kubla Khan

RHYME a b a a b

IN Xanadu did Kubla Khan	
  A stately pleasure-dome decree:	
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran	
Through caverns measureless to man	
  Down to a sunless sea.	     

RHYME a a b c b c

So twice five miles of fertile ground	
With walls and towers were girdled round:	
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,	
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree	
And here were forests ancient as the hills,	  
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.	

RHYME a b a a b
 
But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted	
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!	
A savage place! as holy and enchanted	
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted	  
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!	

RHYME a a b b c c d d

And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething	
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,	
A mighty fountain momently was forced;	
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst	  
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,	
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:	
And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever	
It flung up momently the sacred river.	

RHYME a b b a c c

Five miles meandering with a mazy motion	  
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,	
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,	
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:	
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far	
Ancestral voices prophesying war!	  
 
RHYME a b a b c c

    The shadow of the dome of pleasure	
      Floated midway on the waves;	
    Where was heard the mingled measure	
      From the fountain and the caves.	
It was a miracle of rare device,	  
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!	
 
RHYME a a b b a 

    A damsel with a dulcimer	
      In a vision once I saw:	
    It was an Abyssinian maid,	
      And on her dulcimer she played,	  
    Singing of Mount Abora.

RHYME a b a b c d c c c d e e d
	
    Could I revive within me	
    Her symphony and song,	
To such a deep delight ’twould win me,	
That with music loud and long,	  
I would build that done in air,	
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!	
And all who heard should see them there,	
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!	
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!	  
Weave a circle round him thrice,	
    And close your eyes with holy dread,	
    For he on honey-dew hath fed,	
And drunk the milk of Paradise.
