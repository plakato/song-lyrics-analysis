TITLE Luminarium Poems

RHYME a a b c c b

Wise men alway,
Affirm and say,
That best 'tis for a man,
Diligently,
For to apply
The business that he can;

RHYME a a b c c b

And in no wise
To enterprise
Another faculty,
For he that will
And can no skill
Is never like to thrive           

RHYME a a b c c b

He that hath left
The hosier's craft,
And falleth to making shone,
The smith that shall
To painting fall,
His thrift is well-nigh done.

RHYME a a b c c b

A black draper
With white paper,
To go to writing school,
An old butler
Become a cutler,
I ween shall prove a fool.

RHYME a a b c c b

And an old trot,
That can God wot
Nothing but kiss the cup,
With her physic,
Will keep one sick,
Till she have soused him up.

RHYME a a b c c b

A man of law,
That never saw
The ways to buy and sell,
Weening to rise
By merchandise,
I pray God speed him well.

RHYME a a b c c b

A merchant eke
That will go seek,
By all the means he may,
To fall in suit
Till he dispute
His money clean away;

RHYME a a b c c b

Pleading the law
For every straw,
Shall prove a thrifty man
With 'bate and strife,
But by my life
I cannot tell you whan.

RHYME a a b c c b

When an hatter
Will go smatter
In philosophy,
Or a pedlar
Were a meddler
In theology,

RHYME a a b c c b

All that ensue
Such craftes new,
They drive so far a cast,
That evermore
They do therefore
Beshrew themselves at last.

RHYME a a b c c b

This thing was tried
And verified
Here by a serjeant late
That thriftly was,
Or he could pass,
Rapped about the pate,

RHYME a a b c c b

While that he would
See how he could
In God's name play the frere;
Now if you will
Know how it fell
Take heed and ye shall hear.

RHYME a a b c c b

It happed so
Not long ago
A thrifty man there died,
An hundred pound
Of nobles round,
That had he laid aside.

RHYME a a b c c b

His son he would
Should have this gold
For to begin withal;
But to suffice
This child, well thrice
That money was too small.

RHYME a a b c c b

Yet ere this day
I have heard say,
That many a man certes
Hath with good cast
Be rich at last,
That hath begun with less.

RHYME a a b c c b

But this young man
So well began
His money to employ,
That certainly
His policy,
To see it was a joy.

RHYME a a b c c b

For lest some blast
Might overcast
His ship, or by mischance,
Men with some wile
Might him beguile
And 'minish his substance,

RHYME a a b c c b

For to put out
All manner doubt,
He made a good purvey
For ev'ry whit
By his own wit
And took another way.

RHYME a a b c c b

First fair and well
Thereof much deal
He digg'd it in a pot,
But then he thought
That way was nought
And there he left it not.

RHYME a a b c c b

So was he fain
From thence again
To put it in a cup;
And by and by
Covetously
He supped it fairly-up.

RHYME a a b c c b

In his own breast
He thought it best
His money to inclose,
Then wist he well
Whatever fell
He could it never lose.

RHYME a a b c c b

He borrow'd then
Of other men
Money and merchandise,
Never paid it,
Up he laid it
In like manner wise.

RHYME a a b c c b

Yet on the gear
That he would wear
He rought not what he spent,
So it were nice,
As for the price
Could him not miscontent.

RHYME a a b c c b

With lusty sport
And with resort
Of joly company
In mirth and play
Full many a day
He lived merrily.

RHYME a a b c c b

And men had sworn
Some man is born
To have a lucky hour,
And so was he,
For such degree
He gat and such honour,

RHYME a a b c c b

That without doubt
When he went out,
A serjeant well and fair
Was ready strait
On him to wait
As soon as on the may'r;

RHYME a a b c c b

But he doubtless
Of his meekness
Hated such pomp and pride
And would not go
Companied so
But drew himself aside.

RHYME a a b c c b

To Saint Cath'rine
Strait as a line
He gat him at a tide,
For devotion
Or promotion
There would he needs abide.

RHYME a a b c c b

There spent he fast
Till all was past
And to him came there many
To ask their debt
But none could get
The value of a penny.

RHYME a a b c c b

With visage stout
He bare it out
Even unto the hard hedge,
A month or twain,
Till he was fain
To lay his gown to pledge.

RHYME a a b c c b

Then was he there
In greater fear
Than ere that he came thither,
And would as fain
Depart again
But that he wist not whither.

RHYME a a b c c b

Then after this
To a friend of his
He went, and there abode,
Whereas he lay
So sick alway
He might not come abroad.

RHYME a a b c c b

It happed than
A merchant man
That he ow'd money to
Of an officer
Then 'gan enquire
What him was best to do.

RHYME a a b c c b

And he ans'red,
" Be not afraid
Take an action therefore
I you behest,
I shall him 'rest
And then care for no more."

RHYME a a b c c b

I fear quoth he
It will not be
For he will not come out.
The sergeant said
" Be not afraid
It shall be brought about.

RHYME a a b c c b

In many a game
Like to the same
Have I been well in ure,
And for your sake
Let me be bake
But if I do this cure."

RHYME a a b c c b

Thus part they both,
And forth then go'th
Apace this officer
And for a day
All his array
He changed with a frere.

RHYME a a b c c b

So was he dight
That no man might
Him for a frere deny
He dopp'd and dook'd
He spake and look'd
So religiously.

RHYME a a b c c b

Yet in a glass
Ere he would pass
He toted and he peer'd
His heart for pride
Leapt in his side
To see how well he frer'd.

RHYME a a b c c b

Then forth apace
Unto the place
He goeth in God's name
To do this deed;
But now take heed,
For here begins the game.

RHYME a a b c c b

He drew him nigh
And softily
Straight at the door he knock'd
And a damsel
That heard him well
There came and it unlock'd.

RHYME a a b c c b

The friar said
God speed fair maid
Here lodgeth such a man
It is told me;
Well Sir, quoth she,
And if he do what than?

RHYME a a b c c b

Quoth he, mistress
No harm doubtless,
It 'longeth for our order
To hurt no man,
But as we can
Every wight to farther.

RHYME a a b c c b

With him truly
Fain speak would I.
Sir, quoth she, by my fai
He is so sick
Ye be not like
To speak with him to-day.

RHYME a a b c c b

Quoth he, fair mai
Yet I you pray
This much at my desire
Vouchsafe to do,
As go him to
And say an Austin friar

RHYME a a b c c b

Would with him speak
And matters break
For his avail certain.
Quoth she, I will
Stand you here still
Till I come down again.

RHYME a a b c c b

Up did she go
And told him so
As she was bid to say.
He mistrusting
No manner thing
Said, maiden go thy way

RHYME a a b c c b

And fetch him hither
That we together
May talk.  Adown she go'th.
Up she him brought
No harm she thought
But it made some folk wroth.

RHYME a a b c c b

This officer
This feigned frere
When he was come aloft
He dopped than
And greet this man
Religiously and oft.

RHYME a a b c c b

And he again
Right glad and fain
Took him there by the hand,
The friar then said
You be dismay'd
With trouble I understand.

RHYME a a b c c b

Indeed, quoth he,
It hath with me
Been better than it is.
Sir, quoth the frere,
Be of good cheer,
Yet shall it after this.

RHYME a a b c c b

For Christ his sake
Look that you take
No thought within your breast;
God may turn all,
And so he shall
I trust, unto the best.

RHYME a a b c c b

But I would now
Commune with you,
In counsel if you please,
Or elles not,
Of matters that
Shall set your heart at ease.

RHYME a a b c c b

Down went the maid,
The merchant said
Now say-on gentle frere,
Of this tiding
That you me bring
I long full sore to hear.

RHYME a a b c c b

When there was none
But they alone
The friar with evil grace
Said, I 'rest thee,
Come on with me,
And out he took his mace.

RHYME a a b c c b

Thou shalt obey
Come on thy way
I have thee in my clutch
Thou go'st not hence
For all the pence
The may'r hath in his pouch.

RHYME a a b c c b

This merchant there,
For wrath and fear
He waxing-well nigh wood,
Said, whoreson thief,
With a mischief,
Who hath taught thee thy good.

RHYME a a b c c b

And with his fist
Upon the list
He gave him such a blow
That backward down
Almost in swoon
The friar did overthrow.

RHYME a a b c c b

Yet was this man
Well fearder than
Lest he the fri'r had slain
Till with good raps
And heavy claps
He dawde him up again.

RHYME a a b c c b

The friar took heart
And up he start
And well he laid about
And so there go'th
Between them both
Many a lusty clout.

RHYME a a b c c b

They rent and tear
Each others hair
And clave together fast
Till with lugging
And with tugging
They fell down both at last.

RHYME a a b c c b

Then on the ground
Together round
With many a sad stroke
They roll and rumble,
They turn and tumble
As pigs do in a poke.

RHYME a a b c c b

So long above
They heave and shove
Together, that at last
The maid and wife
To break the strife
Hied them upward fast.

RHYME a a b c c b

And when they spy
The captain's lie
Both weltring on the place
The friar's hood
They pull'd agood
Adown about his face.

RHYME a a b c c b

While he was blind
The wench behind
Lent him laid on the floor
Many a joll
About the noul
With a great battledoor.

RHYME a a b c c b

The wife came yet
And with her feet
She holpe to keep him down
And with her rock
Many a knock
She gave him on the crown.

RHYME a a b c c b

They laid his mace
About his face
That he was wood for pain
The friar frap
Gat many a swap,
Till he was full nigh slain.

RHYME a a b c c b

Up they him lift
And with ill thrift
Headlong along the stair
Down they him threw
And said adieu,
Commend us to the may'r.

RHYME a a b c c b

The friar arose
But I suppose
Amazed was his head
He shook his ears
And from great fears
He thought him well afled.

RHYME a a b c c b

Quoth he, now lost
Is all this cost
We be never the near,
Ill must he theeh
That caused me
To make myself a frere.

RHYME a a b c c b

Now masters all
Here now I shall
End there as I began,
In anywise
I would advise
And counsel ev'ry man,

RHYME a a b c c b

His own craft use
All new refuse
And lightly let them gone
Play not the frere;
Now make good cheer,
And welcome ev'ry chone.

TITLE A Rueful Lamentation

RHYME a b a b b c c

O ye that put your trust and confidence,
In worldly joy and frail prosperity,
That so live here as ye should never hence,
Remember death and look here upon me.
Ensaumple I think there may no better be.
Yourself wotte well that in this realm was I,
Your queen but late, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Was I not born of old worthy lineage?
Was not my mother queen my father king?
Was I not a king’s fere  in marriage?
Had I not plenty of every pleasant thing?
Merciful god this is a strange reckoning:
Riches, honor, wealth, and ancestry
Hath me forsaken and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

If worship might have kept me, I had not gone.
If wit might have me saved, I needed not fear.
If money might have holpe, I lacked none.
But O good God what vaileth  all this gere. 
When death is come thy mighty messenger,
Obey we must there is no remedy,
Me hath he summoned, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Yet was I late promised otherwise,
This year to live in wealth and delice.
Lo where to cometh thy blandishing promise,
O false astrology devynatrice,
Of goddes secrets making thyself so wise?
How true for this year thy prophecy?
The year yet lasteth, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

O brittle wealth, ay full of bitterness,
Thy single pleasure doubled is with pain.
Account my sorrow first and my distress,
In sundry wise, and reckon there again,
The joy that I have had, and I dare sayne.
For all my honor, endured yet have I,
More woe than wealth, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Where are our castles, now where are our Towers?
Goodly Richmond son art thou gone from me,
At Westminster that costly work of yours,
Mine own dear lord now shall I never see.
Almighty god vouchsafe to grant that ye,
For you and your children well may edify.
My palace builded is, for lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Adieu mine own dear spouse my worthy lord,
The faithful love, that did us both combine,
In marriage and peaceable concord,
Into your hands here I clean resign
To be bestowed upon your children and mine.
Erst were you father, and now must ye supply,
The mothers part also, for lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Farewell my daughter lady Margaret.
God wotte full oft it grieved hath my mind,
That ye should go where we should seldom meet.
Now am I gone, and have left you behind.
O mortal folk that we be very blind,
That we least fear, full oft it is most nye,
From you depart I first, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Farewell Madam my lords worthy mother,
Comfort your son, and be ye of good cheer,
Take all a worth, for it will be no nother.
Farewell my daughter Katherine late the fere, 
To prince Arthur mine own child so dear,
It booteth not for me to weep and cry,
Pray for my soul, for now lo here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Adieu lord Henry my loving son adieu.
Our lord increase your honor and estate,
Adieu my daughter Mary bright of hue.
God make you virtuous wise and fortunate.
Adieu sweet heart my little daughter Kate,
Thou shalt sweet babe such is thy destiny,
Thy mother never know, for lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Lady Cicily Anne and Katherine,
Farewell my well-beloved sisters three.
O lady Briget other sister mine,
Lo here the end of worldly vanity.
Now well are ye that earthly folly flee,
And heavenly things love and magnify,
Farewell and pray for me, for lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Adieu my lords, adieu my ladies all,
Adieu my faithful servants every chone, 
Adieu my commons whom I never shall,
See in this world wherefore to the alone,
Immortal god verily three and one,
I me commend thy infinite mercy,
Show to thy servant, for lo now here I lie. 

TITLE Words of Fortune

RHYME a b a b b c c

 Mine high estate power and auctoritie,
If ye ne know, enserche and ye shall spye,
That richesse, worship, welth, and dignitie,
Joy, rest, and peace, and all thyng finally,
That any pleasure or profit may come by,
To mannes comfort, ayde, and sustinaunce,
Is all at my devyse and ordinaunce.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Without my favour there is nothyng wonne.
Many a matter have I brought at last,
To good connclusion, that fondly was begonne.
And many a purpose, bounden sure and fast
With wise provision, I have overcast.
Without good happe there may no wit suffise,
Better is to be fortunate than wyse.

RHYME a b a b b c c

And therefore hath there some men bene or this,
My deadly foes and written many a boke,
To my disprayse. And other cause there nys,
But for me list not frendly on them loke,
Thus lyke the fox they fare that once forsoke,
The pleasaunt grapes, and gan for to defy them,
Because he lept and yet could not come by them.

RHYME a b a b b

But let them write theyr labour is in vayne,
For well ye wote, myrth, honour, and richesse,
Much better is than penury and payne.
The nedy wretch that lingereth in distresse,
Without myne helpe is ever comfortlesse,

TITLE Pageant of Life

RHYME a b a b b c c

I am called Childhood, in play is all my mind,
       To cast a quoit, a cokstele and a ball,
A top can I set and drive it in his kind;
       But would to God these hateful bookes all
       Were in a fire burnt to powder small;
Then might I lead my life always in play,
Which life God send me to mine ending day!

RHYME a b a b b c c

Manhood I am, therefore I me delight
       To hunt and hawk, to nourish-up and feed,
The greyhound to the course, the hawk to the flight,
       And to bestride a good and lusty steed—
       These things become a very man indeed.
Yet thinketh this boy his peevish game sweeter,
But what, no force, his reason is no better.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Whoso na knoweth the strength, power, and might,
       Of Venus and me her little son Cupid;
Thou Manhood shalt a mirrour been aright,
       By us subdued for all thy great pride,
       My fiery dart pierceth thy tender side.
Now thou who erst dispisedst children small
Shall wax a child again and be my thrall.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Old age am I, with lockes thin and hoar,
       Of our short life the last and best part,
Wise and discreet; the public weal therefore
       I help to rule, to my labour and smart.
       Therefore Cupid withdraw thy fiery dart.
Chargeable matters shall of love oppress
Thy childish game and idle business.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Though I be foul, ugly, lean, and mishape,
       Yet there is none in all this world wide,
That may my power withstand or escape;
       Therefore sage father, greatly magnified,
       Descend from your chair, set apart your pride,
Vouchsafe to lend, tho' it be to your pain,
To me, a fool, some of your wise brain.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Fame I am called, marvel you nothing,
       Though with tongues am compassed all round,
For in voice of people is my chief living,
       O cruel Death, thy power I confound.
       When thou a noble man hast brought to ground,
Maugre thy teeth, to live cause him shall I
Of people in perpetual memory.
 	
RHYME a b a b b c c

I whom thou sees with horologe in hand,
       Am named Time, the lord of every hour,
I shall in space destroy both sea and land.
       O simple Fame, how darest thou man honour,
       Promising of his name an endless flower;
Who may in the world have a name eternal
When I shall in process destroy the world and all.

RHYME a b a b a a c c

He needeth not to boast, I am Eternity,
       The very name signifieth well,
And mine empire infinite shall be.
       Thou, mortal Time, every man can tell,
Art nothing else but the mobility
Of sun and moon, changing in every degree;
When they shall leave their course, thou shalt be brought,
For all thy pride and boasting, into nought.

TITLE Two Poems

RHYME a b a b b c c

Eye-flattering Fortune! look thou ne'er so fair,
     Or ne'er so pleasantly begin to smile,
As though thou wouldst my ruin all repair,
     During my life thou shalt not me beguile;
     Trust shall I God to enter in erewhile,
His haven of havens sure and uniform:—
After a calm I still expect the storm.*

RHYME a b a b b c c

Long was I, Lady Luck, your serving-man,
     And now have lost again all that I gat;
When, therefore, I think of you now and then,
     And in my mind remember this and that,
     Ye may not blame me, though I shrew your cat;
In faith I bless you, and a thousand times,
For lending me some leisure to make rhymes.

TITLE 12 Properties

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The first point is to love but one alone,
And for that one all others to forsake:
For whoso5 loveth many loveth none:6
The flood that is in many channels take
In each of them shall feeble streams make:
The love that is divided among many
Uneath7 sufficeth that any part have any.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So thou that hast thy love set unto God
In thy remembrance this imprint8 and grave:
As He in sovereign dignity is odd,9
So will He in love no parting fellows10 have:
Love Him therefore with all that He thee gave:
For body, soul, wit, cunning, mind and thought,
Part will He none, but either all or naught.11

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Of his love, lo, the sight and company
To the lover so glad and pleasant is,
That whoso hath the grace to come thereby
He judgeth him in perfect joy and bliss:
And whoso of that company doth miss,
Live he in never so prosperous estate,12
He thinketh him wretched and infortunate.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So should the lover of God esteem that he
Which all the pleasure hath, mirth and disport,
That in this world is possible to be,
Yet till the time that he may once resort
Unto that blessed, joyful, heavenly port
Where he of God may have the glorious sight,
Is void of perfect joy and sure delight.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The third point of a perfect lover is
To make him fresh to see that all things been13
Appointed well and nothing set amiss
But all well fashioned, proper, goodly, clean:
That in his person, there be nothing seen
In speech, apparel, gesture, look or pace14
That may offend or diminish15 any grace.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So thou that wilt with God get into favor
Garnish16 thyself up in as goodly wise
As comely17 be, as honest in behaviour,
As it is possible for thee to devise:
I mean not hereby that thou shouldest arise
And in the glass upon thy body prowl,18
But with fair virtue to adorn thy soul.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

If love be strong, hot, mighty and fervent,
There may no trouble, grief, or sorrow fall,
But that the lover would be well content
All to endure and think it also19 too small,
Though it were death, so he might therewithal
The joyful presence of that person get
On whom he hath his heart and love set.20

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thus should of God the lover be content
Any distress or sorrow to endure,
Rather than to be from God absent,
And glad to die, so that he may be sure
By his departing hence for to procure,
After this valley dark, the heavenly light,
And of his love the glorious blessed sight.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Not only a lover content is in his heart
But coveteth also and longeth to sustain
Some labor, incommodity,21 or smart,22
Loss, adversity, trouble, grief, or pain:
And of his sorrow joyful is and fain,23
And happy thinketh himself that he may take
Some misadventure24 for his lover's sake.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thus shouldest thou, that lovest God also,
In thine heart wish, covet and be glad
For Him to suffer trouble, pain and woe:
For Whom if thou be never so woe bestead,25
Yet thou ne shalt sustain (be not adread)26
Half the dolour,27 grief and adversity
That He already suffered hath for thee.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The perfect lover longeth for to be
In presence of his love both night and day,
And if it haply so befall that he
May not as he would, he will yet as he may
Ever be with his love, that is to say,
Where his heavy body will not28 be brought
He will be conversant29 in mind and thought.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Lo in like manner the lover of God should,
At the least in such wise as he may,
If he may not in such wise as he would,
Be present with God and conversant always;
For certes, whoso list,30 he may purvey,31
Though all the world would him therefrom bereaven32
To bear his body in earth, his mind in heaven.33

RHYME a b a b b c c 

There is no page or servant, most or least,34
That doth upon his love attend and wait,
There is no little worm, no simple beast,
Nor35 none so small a trifle or conceit,
Lace, girdle, point,36 or proper37 glove strait,38
But that if to his love it has39 been near,
The lover hath40 it precious, lief41 and dear.42

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So every relic, image or picture
That doth pertain to God's magnificence,
The lover of God should with all busy cure43
Have it in love, honor and reverence
And specially give them pre-eminence
Which daily done His blessed body wurche,44
The quick45 relics, the ministers of His Church.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

A very lover above all earthly things
Coveteth and longeth evermore to hear
The honour, laud, commendation and praising,
And everything that may the fame clear46
Of his love: he may in no manner
Endure to hear that therefrom mighten vary
Or anything sound into47 the contrary.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The lover of God should covet in likewise
To hear His honor, worship, laud and praise,
Whose sovereign goodness none heart may comprise,48
Whom hell, earth, and all the heaven obeys,
Whose perfect lover ought by no manner ways
To suffer the cursed words of blasphemy,
Or anything spoken of God unreverently.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

A very lover believeth in his mind
On whomsoever he hath his heart bent,49
That in that person men may nothing find
But honorable, worthy and excellent,
And also50 surmounting far in his intent51
All other that he hath known by sight or name:
And would that every man should think the same.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Of God likewise, so wonderful and high,
All things esteem and judge his lover ought,
So reverence, worship, honor and magnify,52
That all the creatures in this world wrought53
In comparison should he set at nought,
And glad be if he might the mean devise
That all the world would thinken in likewise.54

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The lover is of color dead and pale;
There will no sleep into his eyes stalk;
He favoureth neither meat, wine, nor ale;
He mindeth not what men about him talk;
But eat he, drink he, sit, lie down or walk,
He burneth ever as it were with a fire
In the fervent heat of his desire.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Here should the lover of God example55 take
To have Him continually in remembrance,
With him in prayer and meditation wake,
While others play, revel, sing, and dance:
None earthly joy, disport, or vain plesance56
Should him delight, or anything remove
His ardent mind from God, his heavenly love.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Diversely passioned57 is the lover's heart:
Now pleasant hope, now dread and grievous fear,
Now perfect bliss, now bitter sorrow smart;
And whether his love be with him, or elsewhere,
Oft from his eyes there falleth many a tear,
For very joy, when they together be;
When they be sundered, for adversity.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Like affections58 feeleth also59 the breast
Of God's lover in prayer and meditation:
When that his love liketh in him rest
With inward60 gladness of pleasant contemplation,
Out break the tears for joy and delectation;61
And when his love list eft to part him fro,62
Out break the tears again for pain and woe.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

A very lover will his love obey:
His joy it is and all his appetite
To pain himself in all that ever he may,
That person in whom he set hath his delight63
Diligently to serve both day and night
For very love, without any regard
To any profit, guerdon64 or reward.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So thou likewise that hast thine heart set65
Upward to God, so well thyself endeavor,
So studiously that nothing may thee let
Not for His service any wise dissever:
Freely look also that thou serve thereto,66 never
Trust of reward or profit do thee bind,
But only faithful heart and loving mind.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Wageless to serve, three things may us move:67
First, if the service self be desirable:
Second, if they whom that we serve and love
Be very good and very, amiable:
Thirdly, of reason be we serviceable
Without the gaping68 after any more
To such as have done much for us before.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Serve God for love, then, not for hope of meed:69
What service may so desirable be
As where all turneth to thine own speed?
Who is so good, so lovely also70 as He
Who hath already done so much for thee,
As He that first thee made, and on the rood71
Eft72 thee redeemèd with His precious blood?

RHYME a b a b b c c 

O holy God of dreadful majesty,
Verily one in three and three in one,
Whom angels serve, Whose work all creatures be,
Which heaven and earth directest all alone,
We Thee beseech, good Lord, with woeful moan,
Spare us wretches and wash away our guilt,
That we be not by Thy just anger spilt.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In strait73 balance of rigorous judgment
If Thou shouldst our sin ponder and weigh:
Who able were to bear Thy punishment?
The whole engine74 of all this world, I say,
The engine that enduren shall for aye,
With such examination might not stand
Space of a moment in Thine angry hand.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Who is not born in sin original?
Who doth not actually sin in sundry wise?
But thou, good Lord, art he that sparest all,
With piteous mercy tempering justice:
For as thou dost reward us device75
About our merit / so dost thou dispense
Thy punishment far under our offence.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

More is thy mercy far than76 all our sin,
To give them also that unworthy be,
More godly is and more mercy therein,
Howbeit worthy enough are they pardee,77
Be they never so unworthy, whom that he
Chooses78 to accept, which where so ever he taketh,
Whom he unworthy findeth, worthy maketh.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Wherefore, Good Lord, that always79 merciful art,
Unto thy grace and sovereign dignity,
We silly80 wretches cry with humble heart
Our sin forgot and our malignity,
With piteous yes of thy benignity,
Friendly look on us once,81 thine own we be,
Servants or sinners whether it liketh thee.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Sinners if thou our crime behold certain,
Our crime the work of our uncourteous82 mind
But if thy gifts thou behold again,
Thy gifts noble, wonderful, and kind,
Thou shalt us then the same persons find,
Which are to thee and have be long space,83
Servants by nature, children by thy grace.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

But this thy goodness wringeth84 us alas,
For we whom grace had made thee children dear,
Are made thy guilty folk by our trespass,
Sin hath us guilty made this many a year,
But let thy grace, thy grace that hath no peer.
Of our offence surmount all the preace,85
That in our sin thine honor may increase.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

For thou, thy wisdom though thy sovereign power,
May otherwise appear sufficiently,
As things which thy creatures every hour,
All with one voice declare and testify,
Thy goodness: yet thy singular mercy,
Thy piteous heart thy gracious indulgence
No thing so clearly showeth as our offence.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

What but our sin hath showed that mighty love,
Which able was thy dreadful majesty,
To draw down into earth from heaven above,
And crucify god, that we poor wretches we,
Should from our filthy sin cleansed86 be,
With blood and water of thine own side,
That streamed from thy blessed wounds wide.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thy love and pity thus, O heavenly King,
Our evil maketh matter of thy goodness,
O love, O pity, our wealth ay providing,
O goodness serving thy servants in distress,
O love, O pity, well nigh now thankless
O goodness mighty gracious and wise,
And yet almost now vanquished with our vice.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Grant I thee pray such heat into mine heart,
That to this love of thine may be egall:87
Grant me from Sathanas88 service to astart,89
With whom me rueth90 so long to have be thrall,91
Grant me good Lord and creator of all,
The flame to quench of all sinful desire,
And in thy love set all mine heart afire.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

That when the journey92 of this deadly life
My silly93 ghost hath finished and thence
Departed must without his94 fleshly wife
Alone into his lord’s high presence
He may thee find: O well of indulgence,
In thy lordship not as a lord: but rather
As a very tender loving father.

TITLE 12 Rules

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Whoso2 to virtue esteems3 hard the way
Because we must have war continual
Against the world, the flesh, the devil,4 that ave
Enforce6 themselves to make us bond and thrall,7
Let him remember that choose what may he shall,
Even after the world,8 yet must he need sustain9
Sorrow, adversity, labor, grief, and pain.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Think10 in this wretched world’s busy woe
The battle more sharp and longer is, I wis11
With more labor and less fruit also
In which the end of labor, labor is.12
And when the world hath left us after this
Void of all virtue: the reward when we die
Is nought but fire and pain perpetually.13

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Consider well that folly it is and vain
To look for heaven with pleasure and delight.
Since Christ our Lord and sovereign captain
Ascended never but by manly14 fight
And bitter passion; then were it no right
That any servant, ye will yourself record,15
Should stand in better condition than his lord.16

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Think how that we not only should not grudge
But also be glad and joyful of this fight,
And long therefore—although we could not judge
How that thereby redound17 unto us might
Any profit, but only for delight—
To be conformed and like in some behavior
To Jesu Christ our blessed Lord and Savoir.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

As often as thou dost war and strive,
By the resistance of any sinful motion,
Against any of thy sensual wits five,18
Cast in thy mind19 as oft with good devotion
How thou resemblest Christ: as with sour potion
If thou pain thy taste: remember therewithal
How Christ for thee tasted eysell and gall.20

RHYME a b a b b c c 

If thou withdraw thine hands and forbear
The ravishing21 of anything: remember then
How His innocent hands nailed were.
If thou be tempt with pride: think how that when
He was in form of God, yet of a bondman22
He took the shape and humbled Himself for thee
To the most odious and vile death of a tree.23

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Consider when thou art moved to be wroth24
He Who that was God, and of all men the best,
Seeing Himself scorned and scourged both,
And as a thief between two thieves thrests25
With all rebuke and shame: yet from his breast
Came never sign of wrath or of disdain,
But patiently endured all the pain.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thus every snare and engine26 of the devil
If thou this wise27 peruse28 them by and by
There can be none so cursed or so evil
But to some virtue thou mayst it apply.
For oft thou shalt, resisting valiantly
The fiend’s might and subtle fiery dart,
Our Savior Christ resemble in some part.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Remember well that we in no wise must,
Neither in the foresaid spiritual armor29
Nor any other remedy, put our trust,
But only in the virtue of our Savior:
For He it is by Whose mighty power
The world was vanquished and its prince cast out
Which reigned before in all the earth about.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In Him let us trust to overcome all evil,
In Him let us put our hope and confidence
To subdue the flesh and master the devil,
To Him be all honor and lowly reverence;
Oft should we require with all our diligence
With prayer, with tears, and lamentable plaints
The aid of His grace and His holy saints.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

One sin vanquished, look thou not tarry,
But lie in await for another very hour,30
For as a wood31 lion, the fiend, our adversary,
Runneth about seeking whom he may devour;32
Wherefore continually upon thy tower,33
Lest he thee unpurveyed34 and unready catch,
Thou must with the prophet stand and keep watch.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Enforce35 thyself not only for to stand
Unvanquished against the devil's might,
But over that take valiantly on hand
To vanquish him and put him unto flight:36
And that is when of the same deed, thought or sight
By which he would have thee with sin contract,
Thou takest occasion of some good virtuous act.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Sometime he secretly casteth in thy mind
Some laudable deed to stir thee to pride,
As vainglory maketh many a man blind.
But let humility be thy sure guide,
Thy good work to God let it be applied,
Think it not thine but a gift of His
Of Whose grace undoubtedly all goodness is.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In time of battle so put thyself in preace37
As though thou shouldest after that victory
Enjoy forever a perpetual peace:
For God of His goodness and liberal mercy
May grant the gift, and also thy proud enemy,
Confounded and rebuked by thy battle,
Shall thee no more haply for very shame assail.38

RHYME a b a b b c c 

But when thou mayest once the triumph obtain
Prepare thyself and trim thee in thy gear
As thou shouldest incontinent39 fight again,
For if thou be ready, the devil will thee fear:
Wherefore in any wise so even thou thee bear
That thou remember and have ever in memory
In victory battle, in battle victory.40

RHYME a b a b b c c 

If thou think thyself well fenced and sure
Against every subtle suggestion of vice,
Consider frail glass may no distress endure,
And great adventurers often curse the dice:41
Jeopard not too far42 therefore and ye be wise,
But evermore eschew43 the occasions of sin,
For he that loveth peril shall perish therein.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In all temptation withstand the beginning—
The cursed infants of wretched Babylon!44
To suffer them wax is a jeopardous thing:45
Beat out their brains therefore at the stone:46
Perilous is the canker that catcheth the bone:47
Too late cometh the medicine if thou let the sore
By long continuance increase more and more.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Though in the time of the battle and war
The conflict seem bitter, sharp and sour,
Yet consider it is more pleasure far
Over the devil to be a conqueror
Than is in the use of thy beastly pleasure:
Of virtue more joy the conscience hath within
Than outward the body of all his filthy sin.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In this point many men err for negligence
For they compare not the joy of the victory
To the sensual pleasure of their concupiscence,48
But like rude beasts unadvisedly
Lacking discretion they compare and apply
Of their foul sin the voluptuous delight
To the laborious travail of the conflict and fight.49

RHYME a b a b b c c 

And yet alas he that oft hath known
What grief it is by long experience
Of his cruel enemy to be overthrown,
Should once at the leastwise do his diligence
To prove and essay50 with manly defense
What pleasure there is, what honor, peace and rest
In glorious victory, triumph and conquest.51

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Though thou be tempted, despair thee nothing:
Remember the glorious apostle Saint Paul
When he had seen God in His perfect being,
Lest such revelation should his heart extol,
His flesh was suffered to rebel against his soul:52
This did almighty God of His goodness provide
To preserve His servant from the danger of pride.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

And here take heed that he whom God did love,
And for His most especial vessel chose,
Ravished into the third heaven above,
Yet stood in peril lest pride might him depose:
Well ought we then our hearts fence and close
Against vainglory, the mother of reprief,53
The very crop and root of all mischief.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Against this pomp and wretched worlds gloss
Consider how Christ the Lord, sovereign power,
Humbled Himself for us unto the cross:
And peradventure death within one hour
Shall us bereave wealth, riches and honor:
And bring us down full low both small and great
To vile carrion and wretched worms meat.

TITLE 12 Weapons

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Consider well the pleasure that thou hast,
Stand it in touching or in wanton sight,1
In vain smell or in thy licorous2 taste,
Or finally, in whatsoever delight
Occupied is thy wretched appetite:
Thou shalt it find, when thou hast all cast,3
Little, simple, short and suddenly past.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Any good work if thou with labor do,
The labor goeth, the goodness doth remain:
If thou do evil with pleasure joined thereto,
The pleasure which thine evil work doth contain
Glideth his way, thou must him not restrain:
The evil then in thy breast cleaveth behind
With grudge of heart and heaviness of mind.4

RHYME a b a b b c c 

When thou laborest thy pleasure for to buy
Upon the price look thou well thee advise,
Thou sellest thy soul therefore even by and by
To thy most utter despiteous5 enemies:6
O mad merchant, O foolish merchandise,
To buy a trifle, O childish reckoning,
And pay therefore so dear a precious thing!

RHYME a b a b b c c 

This wretched life, the trust and confidence
Of whose continuance maketh us bold to sin,
Thou perceivest well by experience,
Since that hour in which it did begin,
It holdeth on the course and will not lin,7
But fast it runneth on and passen shall
As doth a dream or shadow on the wall.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Consider well that ever night and day,
While that we busily provide and care
For our disport,8 revel, mirth and play,
For pleasant melody and dainty fare,
Death stealeth on full slyly and unaware:
He lieth at hand and shall us enterprise9
We know not how soon nor in what manner wise.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

If thou shouldst God offend, think how therefore
Thou were forthwith10 in very jeopardous11 case:
For haply thou shouldst not live an hour more
Thy sin to cleanse, and though thou haddest space,
Yet peradventure shouldst thou lack the grace:
Well ought we then be feared to do offence
Impenitent lest we departen hence.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thou seest this world is but a thoroughfare,12
See thou behave thee wisely with thine host;13
Hence must thou needs depart naked and bare,
And after thy desert look to what cost
Thou art conveyed at such time as thy ghost14
From this wretched carcass shall dissever:15
Be it joy or pain, endure it shall forever.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Remember how God hath made thee reasonable
Like unto His image and figure,16
And for thee suffered pains intolerable17
That He, for an angel, never would endure.18
Regard, O man, thine excellent nature;19
Thou that with angels art made to be equal,20
For very shame be not the devil's thrall.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Why lovest thou so this brittle21 world’s joy?
Take all the mirth, take all the fantasies,
Take every game, take every wanton toy,
Take every sport that men can thee devise:
And among them all on warrantise22
Thou shalt no pleasure comparable find
To th' inward gladness of a virtuous mind.23

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Beside that God thee bought24 and formed both
Many a benefit hast thou received of His:
Though thou have moved Him often to be wroth25
Yet He thee kept hath and brought thee up to this,
And daily calleth upon thee to His bliss:
How mayst thou then to Him unloving be
That ever hath been so loving unto thee?

RHYME a b a b b c c 

When thou in flame of the temptation friest
Think on the very lamentable pain,
Think on the piteous cross of woeful Christ,
Think on His blood beat out at every vein,
Think on His precious heart carved in twain,26
Think how for thy redemption all was wrought:
Let Him not lose thee that He so dear hath bought.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Sin to withstand say not thou lackest might:
Such allegations27 folly it is to use;28
The witness of saints, and martyrs' constant sight
Shall thee of slothful29 cowardice accuse:
God will thee help if thou do not refuse:
If other have stood30 or,31 this thou mayst eftsoon:32
Nothing impossible is that hath been done.
