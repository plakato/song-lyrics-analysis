RHYME a b a b 

With ekes and alsos tack thy strain, 
Great bard ; and sing the deathless prince, 
Who lost Namur the same campaign, 
He bought Dixmuyd, and pUinder'd Deynse. 

RHYME a b a b *

I'll hold ten pound my dream is out : 
I'd tell it you, but for the rattle 
Of those confounded drums ; no doubt 
Yon bloody rogues intend a battle. 
Dear me ! a hundred thousand French 
With terror fill the neighb'ring field : 
While William carries on the trench, 
Till both the town and castle yield. 
Villeroy to Boufflers should advance, 
Says Mars, through cannons' mouths in fire ; 
Id est, one mareschal of France 
Tells t'other, he can come no nigher. 
Regain the lines the shortest way, 
Villeroy ; or to Versailles take post ; 
For, having seen it, thou canst say 
The steps, by which Namur was lost. 

RHYME a b a b *

The smoke and fiame may vex thy sight : 
Look not once back : but as thou goest, 
Quicken the squadrons in their flight, 
And bid the d â€” a  take the slowest. 
Think not what reason to produce, 
From Louis to conceal thy fear : 
He a a  own the strength of thy excuse ; 
Tell him that William was but there. 

RHYME a b a b *

Now let us look for Louis' feather, 
That us'd to shine so like a star : 
The gen'rals could not g'et together, 
Wanting that influence, great in war. 
O Poet ! thou hadst been discreeter, 
Hanging the monarch's hat so high ; 
If thou hadst dubb'd thy star a meteor. 
That did but blaze, and rove, and die. 

RHYME a b a b *

To animate the doubtful fight, 
Namur in vain expects that ray : 
In vain France hopes, the sickly light 
Should shine near William's fuller day : 
It knows Versailles, its proper station ; 
Nor cares for any foreign sphere : 
Where you see Boileau's constellation, 
Be sure no danger can be near. 

RHYME a b a b *

The French had gather'd all their force ; 
And William met them in their way : 
Yet oÂ£f they brush'd, both foot and horse. 
What has friend Boileau left to say ? 

RHYME a b a b *

When his high Muse is bent upon't, 
To sing her king â€” that great commander, 
Or on the shores of Hellespont, 
Or in the valleys near. Scamander ; 

RHYME a b a b *

Would it not spoil his noble task. 
If any foolish Phrygian there is 
Impertinent enough to ask. 
How far Namur may be from Paris. 

RHYME a b a b *

Two stanzas more before we end, 
Of death, pikes, rocks, arms, bricks, and fire : 
Leave them behind you, honest friend ; 
And with your countrymen retire. 

RHYME a b a b *

Your ode is spoilt ; Namur is freed ; 
For Dixmuyd something yet is due : 
â– ^0 good Count Guiscard may proceed; * 
But Boufflers, Sir, one word with you

RHYME a b a b *

"Tis done. In sight of these commanders, 
Who neither fight, nor raise the siege, 
The foes of France march safe through Flanders ; 
Divide to Bruxelles, or to Liege. 

RHYME a b a b *

Send, Fame, this news to Trianon, 
That Boufflers may new honours gain : 
He the same play by land has shown. 
As Tour^^lle did upon the main.

RHYME a b a b *

Yet is the marshal made a peer ! 
O William, may thy arms advance ; 
That he may lose Dinant next year, 
And so be constable of France. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

Ye careful angels, whom eternal Fate 
Ordains, on earth and human acts to wait ; 
Who turn with secret power this restless ball, 
And bid predestin'd empires rise and fall : 
Your sacred aid religious monarchs own, 
When first they merit, then ascend the throne : 
But tyrants dread ye, lest your just decree 
Transfer the power, and set the people free. 
See rescu'd Britain at your altars bow ; 
And hear her hymns your happy care avow : 
That still her axes and her rods support 
The judge's frown, and grace the awful court ; 
That Law with all her pompous terror stands, 
To wrest the dagger from the traitor's hands ; 
And rigid justice reads the fatal word, 
Poises the balance first, then draws the sword. 

RHYME a a *

Britain her safety to your guidance owns, 
That she can sep'rate parricides from sons ; 
That, impious rage disarm'd, she lives and reigns, 
Her freedom kept by him, who broke her chains. 

RHYME a a *

And thou, great minister, above the rest 
Of guardian spirits, be thou for ever blest ; 
Thou, who of old wert sent to Israel's court, 
With secret aid great David's strong support ; 
To mock the frantic rage of cruel Saul, 
And strike the useless javelin to the wall. 
Thy later care o'er William's temples held. 
On Boyne's propitious banks, the heav'nly shield ; 
When power divine did sovereign right declare, 
And cannons mark'dwhom they were bid to spare. 

RHYME a a *

Still, blessed angel, be thy care the same ! 
Be William's life untouch'd, as is his fame ! 
Let him own thine, as Britain owns his hand : 
Save thou the king, as he has sav'd the land ! 

RHYME a a *

We angels' forms in pious monarchs view ; 
We reverence William ; for he acts like you ; 
Like you, commission'd to chastise and bless, 
He must avenge the world, and give it peace. 

RHYME a a *

Indulgent Fate our potent prayer receives ; 
And still Britannia smiles, and William lives. 
The hero dear to earth, by heav'n belov'd. 
By troubles must be vex'd, by dangers prov'd : 
His foes must aid to make his fame complete. 
And fix his throne secure on their defeat. 

RHYME a a *

So, though with sudden rage the tempest comes; 
Though the winds roar, and though the water foams, 

RHYME a a *

Imperial Britain on the sea looks down, 
And smiling sees her rebel subject frown : 
Striking her cliff, the storm confirms her pow'r ; 
The waves but whiten her triumphant shore : 
In vain they would advance, in vain retreat : 
Broken they dash, and perish at her feet. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d e e f f g g 

For William still new wonders shall be shown : 
The powers that rescued, shall preserve the throne. 
Safe on his darling Britain's joyful sea, 
Behold, the monarch ploughs his liquid way : 
His fleets in thunder through the world declare, 
Whose empire they obey, whose arms they bear. 
Bless'd by aspiring winds, he finds the strand 
Blacken'd with clouds ; he sees the nations stand 
Blessing his safety, proud of his command. 
In vsirious tongues he hears the captains dwell 
On their great leader's praise ; by turns they tell, 
And listen, each with emulous glory fir'd. 
How William conquer'd, and how France retir'd ; 
How Belgia freed the hero's arm confess'd, 
But trembled for the courage which she bless'd. 

RHYME a a *

O Louis, from this great example know. 
To be at once a hero, and a foe : 
By sounding trumpets, hear, and rattling drums. 
When William to the open vengeance comes : 
And see the soldier plead the monarch's right, 
Heading his troops, and foremost in the fight. 

RHYME a a *

Hence then, close Ambush and perfidious War, 
Down to your native seats of Night repair. 
And thou, Bellona, weep thy cruel pride 
Restraiii'd, behind the victor's chariot tied 
In brazen knots, and everlasting chains, 
(So Europe's peace, so William's fate ordains). 
While on the ivory chair, in happy state. 
He sits, secure in innocence, and great 
In regal clemency ; and views beneath 
Averted darts of rage, and pointless arms of death. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

See, whilst thou weep'st, fair Cloe, see 
The world in sympathy with thee. 
The cheerful birds no longer sing ; 
Each droops his head, and hangs his wing. 
The clouds have bent their bosom lower, 
And shed their sorrows in a shower. 
The brooks beyond their limits flow ; 
And louder murmurs speak their woe. 
The nymphs and swains adopt thy cares ; 
They heave thy sighs, and weep thy tears. 
Fantastic nymph ! that grief should move 
Thy heart obdurate against Love. 
Strange tears ! whose power can soften all. 
But that dear breast on which they fall. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b 

Dear Howard, from the soft assaults of Love, 
Poets and painters never are secure ; 
Can I untouch'd the fair ones' passions move ? 
Or thou draw beauty, and not feel its power ? 

RHYME a b a b 

To great Apelles when young Aramon brought * 
The darling idol of his captive heart ; 
And the pleas'd nymph with kind attention sat, 
To have her charms recorded by his art : 

RHYME a b a b 

The am'rous master own'd her potent eyes ; 
Sigh'd when he look'd, and trembled as he drew ; 
Each flowing line confirm'd his first surprise, 
And as the piece advanc'd, the passion grew. 

RHYME a b a b 

While Philip's son, while Venus' son was near. 
What different tortures does his bosom feel ! 
Great was the rival, and the god severe : 
Nor could he hide his flame, nor durst reveal. 

RHYME a b a b 

The prince, renown'd in bounty as in arms. 
With pity saw the ill-conceal'd distress ; 
Quitted his title to Campaspe's charms, 
And gave the fair one to the friend's embrace. 

RHYME a b a b 

Thus the more beauteous Cloe sat to thee, 
Good Howard, emulous of the Grecian art: 
But happy thou, from Cupid's arrow free, 
And flames that pierc'd thy predecessor's heart. 

RHYME a b a b 

Had thy poor breast receiv'd an equal pain ; 
Had I been vested with the monarch's power; 
Thou must have sigh'd, unlucky youth, in vain ; 
Nor from my bounty hadst thou found a cure. 

RHYME a b a b 

Though to convince thee, that the friend did feel 
A kind concern for thy ill-fated care, 
I would have sooth'd the flame I could not heal ; 
Giv'n thee the world, though I withheld the fair. 

TITLE

RHYME a a b b c c c 

Beneath a myrtle's verdant shade 
As Cloe half asleep was laid, 
Cupid perch'd lightly on her breast, 
And in that heav'n desir'd to rest : 
Over her paps his wings he spread : 
Between he found a downy bed, 
And nestled in his little head. 

RHYME a a b b 

Still lay the god : the nymph surpris'd, 
Yet mistress of herself, devis'd 
How she the vagrant might enthral, 
And captive him, who captives all. 

RHYME a a a 

Her bodice half-way she unlac'd ; 
About his arms she shiy cast 
The silken bond, and held him fast. 

RHYME a a b b 

The god awak'd ; and thrice in vain 
He strove to break the cruel chain ; 
And thrice in vain he shook his wing, 
Incumber'd in the silken string. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

Flutt'ring the god, and weeping said, 
Pity poor Cupid, generous maid, 
Who happen'd, being blind, to stray, 
And on thy bosom lost his way ; 
Who stray'd, alas ! but knew too well, 
He never there must hope to dwell : 
Set an unhappy pris'ner free. 
Who ne'er intended harm to thee. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

To me pertains not, she replies, 
To know or care where Cupid flies ; 
What are his haunts, or which his way ; 
Where he would dwell, or whither stray : 
Yet will I never set thee free : 
For harm was meant, and harm to me. 

RHYME a a b b 

Vain fears that vex thy virgin heart ! 
I'll give thee up my bow and dart; 
Untangle but this cruel chain, 
And freely let me fly again. 

RHYME a a b b 

Agreed : secure my virgin heart : 
Instant give up thy bow and dart: 
The chain I'll in return untie ; 
And freely thou again shalt fly. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Thus she the captive did deliver ; 
The captive thus gave up his quiver. 
The god disarm'd, e'er since that day 
Passes his life in harmless play : 
Flies round, or sits upon her breast, 
A little, fluttering, idle guest. 

RHYME a a *

E'er since that day the beauteous maid 
Governs the world in Cupid's stead ; 
Directs his arrow as she wills ; 
Gives grief, or pleasure ; spares, or kills. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

Behind her neck her comely tresses tied, 
Her ivory quiver graceful by her side, 
A-hunting Cloe went : she lost her way, 
And through the woods uncertain chanc'd to stray, 
Apollo passing by beheld the maid ; 
And, Sister dear, bright Cynthia, turn, he said : 
The hunted hind lies close in yonder brake. 
Loud Cupid laugh'd, to see the god's mistake ; 
And laughing, cried, Learn better, great divine. 
To know thy kindred, and to honour mine. 
Rightly advis'd, far hence thy sister seek. 
Or on Meander's bank, or Latmus' peak. 
But in this nymph, my friend, my sister know : 
She draws my arrows, and she bends my bow : 
Fair Thames she haunts, and every neighb'ring grove, 
Sacred to soft recess, and gentle love. 
Go, with thy Cynthia, hurl the pointed spear 
At the rough boar, or chase the flying deer : 
I and my Cloe take a nobler aim : 
At human hearts we fling, nor ever miss the game. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

In Heaven, one holiday, you read 
In wise Anacreon, Ganymede 
Drew heedless Cupid in, to throw 
A main, to pass an hour, or so. 
The little Trojan, by the way. 
By Hermes taught, play'd all the play. 

RHYME a a *

The god unhappily engag'd. 
By nature rash, by play enrag'd, 
Complain'd, and sigh'd, and cried, and fretted 
Lost every earthly thing he betted : 
In ready-money, all the store 
Pick'd up long since from Dana'e's shower ; 
A snuff-box, set with bleeding hearts. 
Rubies, all pierc'd with diamond darts ; 
His nine-pins made of myrtle wood 
(The tree in Ida's forest stood) ; 
His bowl pure gold, the very same 
Which Paris gave the Cyprian dame ; 
Two table-books in shagreen covers ; 
Fill'd with good verse from real lovers ; 

RHYME a a *

Merchandise rare ! a billet-doux, 
Its matter passionate, yet true ; 
Heaps of hair rings, and cipher'd seals ; 
Rich trifles ; serious bagatelles. 

RHYME a a *

What sad disorders play begets ! 
Desperate and mad, at length he sets 
Those darts, whose points make gods adore 
His might, and deprecate his power : 
Those darts, whence all our joy and pain 
Arise : those darts â€” Come, seven's the main. 
Cries Ganymede : the usual trick : 
Seven, slur a six ; eleven, a nick. 

RHYME a a *

Ill news goes fast : 'twas quickly known. 
That simple Cupid was undone. 
Swifter than lightning Venus flew : 
Too late she found the thing too true. 
Guess how the goddess greets her son : 
Come hither, sirrah : no, begone ; 

RHYME a a *

And, hark ye, is it so indeed ? 
A comrade you for Ganymede ? 
An imp as wicked, for his age. 
As any earthly lady's page ; 
A scandal and a scourge to Troy ; 
A prince's son ! a black -guard boy ; 
A sharper, that with box and dice 
Draws in young deities to vice. 
All Heaven is by the ears together. 
Since first that little rogue came hither: 
Juno herself has had no peace : 
And truly I've been favour'd less : 

RHYME a a *

For Jove, as Fame reports (but Fame 
Says things not fit for me to name), 
Has acted ill for such a god, 
And taken ways extremely odd. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

And thou, unhappy child, she said 
(Her anger by her grief allay'd), 
Unhappy child, who thus hast lost 
All the estate we e'er could boast ; 
Whither, O whither wilt thou run. 
Thy name despis'd, thy weakness known ? 
Nor shall thy shrine on earth be crown'd ; 
Nor shall thy power in Heaven be own'd ; 
When thou, nor man, nor god canst wound. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Obedient Cupid kneeling cried. 
Cease, dearest mother, cease to chide : 
Gany's a cheat, and I'm a bubble : 
Yet why this great excess of trouble ? 
The dice were false : the darts are gone : 
Yet how are you or I undone ? 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

The loss of these I can supply 
With keener shafts from Cloe's eye : 
Fear not, we e'er can be disgrac'd, 
While that bright magazine shall last : 
Your crowded altars still shall smoke ; 
And man your friendly aid invoke : 
Jove shall again revere your power, 
And rise a swan, or fall a shower. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b 

As after noon, one summer's day, 
Venus stood bathing in a river, 
Cupid a-shooting went that way. 
New stnmg his bow, new fill'd his quiver. 

RHYME a b a b 

With skill he chose his sharpest dart. 
With all his might his bow he drew ; 
Swift to his beauteous parent's heart 
The too well-guided arrow flew. 

RHYME a b a b 

I faint ! I die ! the goddess cried ; 
cruel, couldst thou find none other, 
To wreck thy spleen on ? Parricide ! 
Like Nero, thou hast slain thy mother. 

RHYME a b a b 

Poor Cupid sobbing scarce could speak ; 
Indeed, mamma, I did not know ye : 
Alas ! how easy my mistake ; 
I took you for your likeness Cloe. 

RHYME a a b b 

When Cloe's picture was to Venus shown, 
I Surpris'd, the goddess took it for her own. 
And what, said she, does this bold painter mean? 
When was I bathing thus, and naked seen? 

RHYME a b a b 

Pleas'd Cupid heard, and check'd his mother's pride : 
And who's blind now, mamma ? the urchin cried. 
'Tis Cloe's eye, and cheek, and lip, and breast : 
Friend Howard's g^enius fancied all the rest. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b *

If wine and music have the power 
To ease the sickness of the soul ; 
Let Phoebus ever)" string explore ; 
And Bacchus fill the sprig-htly bowl. 
Let them their friendly aid employ. 
To make my Cloe's absence light ; 
And seek for pleasure, to destroy 
The sorrows of this live-long night. 

RHYME a b a b *

But she to-morrow will return ; 
Venus, be thou to-morrow great ; 
Thy myrtles strow, thy odours burn ; 
And meet thy fav'rite nymph in state. 
Kind goddess, to no other powers 
Let us to-morrow's blessings own : 
Thy darling loves shall gniide the hours, 
And all the day be thine alone. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b *

In Virgil's sacred verse we find. 
That passion can depress or raise 
The heavenly as the human mind : 
Who dare deny what Virgil says ? 

RHYME a b a b *

But if they should, what our great master 
Has thus laid down, my tale shall prove. 
Fair Venus wept the sad disaster 
Of having lost her favourite Dove. 

RHYME a b a b *

In complaisance poor Cupid mourn'd ; 
His grief reliev'd his mother's pain ; 
He vow'd he'd leave no stone unturn'd. 
But she should have her Dove again. 

RHYME a b a b *

Though none, said he, shall yet be nam'd. 
I know the felon well enough : 
But be she not, mamma, condemn'd 
Without a fair and legal proof. 

RHYME a b a b *

With that, his longest dart he took, 
As constable would take his staff: 
That gods desire like men to look, 
Would make e'en Heraclitus laugh. 

RHYME a b a b *

Love's subalterns, a duteous band, 
Like watchmen round their chief appear : 
Each had his lantern in his hand : 
And Venus mask'd brought up the rear. 

RHYME a b a b *

Accoutred thus, their eager step 
To Cloe's lodging they directed : 
(At once I write, alas ! and weep, 
That Cloe is of theft suspected.) 

RHYME a b a b *

Late they set out, had far to go : 
St. Dunstan's, as they pass'd, struck one. 
Cloe, for reasons good, you know, 
Lives at the sober end o' th' town. 

RHYME a b a b *

With one great peal they rap the door. 
Like footmen on a visiting day. 
Folks at her house at such an hour ! 
Lord ! what will all the neighbours say ? 

RHYME a b a b *

The door is open : up they run : 
Nor prayers, nor threats divert their speed : 
Thieves! thieves! cries Susan ; Ave're undone; 
They'll kill my mistress in her bed. 

RHYME a b a b *

In bed indeed the nymph had been 
Three hours : for all historians say, 
She commonly went up at ten, 
Unless piquet was in the way. 

RHYME a b a b *

She wak'd, he sure, with strangle surprise, 
O Cupid, is this right or law, 
Thus to disturb the brightest eyes. 
That ever slept, or ever saw ? 

RHYME a b a b *

Have you observ'd a sitting- hare, 
Listening, and fearful of the storm 
Of horns and hounds, clap back her ear. 
Afraid to keep, or leave her form ? 

RHYME a b a b *

Or have you mark'd a partridge quake. 
Viewing the towering falcon nigh ? 
She cuddles low behind the brake : 
Nor would she stay ; nor dares she fly. 

RHYME a b a b *

Then have you seen the beauteous maid ; 
When gazing on her midnight foes, 
She turn'd each way her frighted head. 
Then sunk it deep beneath the clothes. 

RHYME a b a b *

Venus this while was in the chamber 
Incognito : for Susan said. 
It smelt so strong of myrrh and amber 
And Susan is no lying maid. 

RHYME a b a b *

But since we have no present need 
Of Venus for an episode, 
With Cupid let us e'en proceed ; 
And thus to Cloe spoke the god : 

RHYME a b a b *

Hold up your head : hold up your hand : 
Would it were not my lot to show ye 
This cruel writ, wherein you stand 
Indicted by the name of Cloe ; 

RHYME a b a b *

For that by secret malice stirr'd, 
Or by an emulous pride invited, 
You have purloin'd the fav'i-ite bird, 
In which my mother most delighted 

RHYME a b a b *

Her blushing face the lovely maid 
Rais'd just above the milk-white sheet, 
A rose-tree in a lily bed 
Nor glows so red, nor breathes so sweet. 

RHYME a b a b *

Are you not he whom virgins fear. 
And widows court ? is not your name 
Cupid ? If so, pray come not near
Fair maiden, I'm the very same. 

RHYME a b a b *

Then what have I, good Sir, to say, 
Or do with hsr, you call your mother '' 
If I should meet her in my way. 
We hardly courtesy to each other. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b *

Diana chaste, and Hebe sweet, 
Witness that what I speak is true : 
I would not give my paroquet 
For all the Doves that ever flew. 

RHYME a b a b *

Yet, to compose this midnight noise, 
Go freely search where er you please : 
(The rage that rais'd, adorn'd her voice) 
Upon yon toilet lie my keys. 

RHYME a b a b *

Her keys he takes ; her doors unlocks : 
Through wardrobe, and through closet bounces 
Peeps into eveiy chest and box ; 
Turns all her furbelows and flounces. 

RHYME a b a b *

But Dove, depend on't, finds he none ; 
So to the bed returns again : 
And now the maiden, bolder grown, 
Begins to treat him with disdain. 

RHYME a b a b *

I marvel much, she smiling said. 
Your poultry cannot yet be found : 
Lies he in yonder slipper dead, 
Or may be, in the tea-pot drown'd ? 

RHYME a b a b *

No, traitor, angry Love replies. 
He's hid somewhere about your breast ; 
A place nor god nor man denies. 
For Venus' Dove the proper nest. 

RHYME a b a b *

Search then, she said, put in your hand, 
And Cynthia, dear protectress, guard me ; 
As guilty I, or free may stand. 
Do thou, or punish, or reward me. 

RHYME a b a b *

But ah ! what maid to Love can trust; 
He scorns, and breaks all legal power : 
Into her breast his hand he thrust ; 
And in a moment forc'd it lower. 

RHYME a b a b *

U, whither do those fingers rove. 
Cries Cloe, treacherous urchin, whither ? 
O Venus ! I shall find thy Dove, 
Savs he ; for sure I touch his feather. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

As Cloe came into the room t'other day, 
I peevish began ; where so long could you stay ? 
In your life-time you never regarded your hour : 
You promis'd at two ; and (pray look, child) 'tis four. 
A lady's watch needs neither figures nor wheels : 
'Tis enough, that 'tis loaded with bawbles and seals. 
A temper so heedless no mortal can bear
Thus far I went on with a resolute air. 
Lord bless me, said she ; let a body but speak : 
Hero's an ugly hard rose-bud fallen into my neck ; 

RHYME a a *

It has hurt me, and vex'd me to such a degree 
See here ! for you never believe me ; pray see, 
On the left side my breast what a mark it has made ! 
So saying, her bosom she careless display'd : 
That seat of delight I with wonder suited
And forgot every word I designed to have said. 

RHYME a a *

In sullen humour one day Jove 
Sent Hermes down to Ida's grove, 
Commanding Cupid to deliver 
His store of darts, his total quiver ; 
That Hermes should the weapons break, 
Or throw 'em into Lethe's lake. 

RHYME a a *

Hermes, you know, must do his errand 
He found his man, produc'd his warrant ; 
Cupid, your darts â€” this very hour
There's no contending against power. 

RHYME a a *

How sullen Jupiter, just now, 
I think I said ; and you'll allow. 
That Cupid was as bad as he : 
Hear but the youngster's repartee. 

RHYME a a *

Come, kinsman (said the little god). 
Put off your wings, lay by your rod ; 
Retire with me to yonder bower. 
And rest yourself for half an hour : 
'Tis far indeed from hence to Heaven : 
But you fly fast ; and 'tis but seven. 
We'll take one cooling cup of nectar ; 
And drink to this celestial hector 

RHYME a a *

He break my dart, or hurt my power ! 
He, Leda's swan, and Danae's shower ! 
Go, bid him his wife's tongue restrain. 
And mind his thunder, and his rain. â€” 
My darts ! O certainly I'll give 'em : 
From Cloe's eyes he shall receive 'em. 
There's one, the best in all my quiver, 
Twang ! through his very heart and liver, 
He then shall pine, and sigh, and rave : 
Good lord ! what bustle shall we have ! 

RHYME a a *

Neptune must straight be sent to sea. 
And Flora summon'd twice a day : 
One must find shells, and t'other flowers, 
For cooling grots, and fragrant bowers. 
That Cloe may be serv'd in state : 
The Hours must at her toilet wait : 
Whilst all the reasoning fools below 
Wonder their watches go too slow, 
Lybs must fly south, and Eurus east, 
For jewels for her hair and breast : 

RHYME a a *

No matter though their cruel haste 
Sink cities, and lay forests waste. 
No matter though this fleet be lost ; 
Or that lie wind-bound on the coast. 
What whispering in my mother's ear ! 
What care, that Juno should not hear ! 
What woik among you scholar gods ! 
Phcebus must write him am'rous odes : 

RHYME a a *

And thou, poor cousin, must compose 
His letters in submissive prose ; 
Whilst haughty Cloe, to sustain 
The honour of my mystic reig-n. 
Shall all his gifts and vows disdain ; 
And laugh at your old bully's pain. 
Dear couz., said Hermes in a fright. 
For Heaven's sake, keep your darts ! good night. 

RHYME a a *

Resolve me, Cloe, what is this : 
Or forfeit me one precious kiss. 
'Tis the first oflfspring of the Graces ; 
Bears difterent forms in different places ; 
Acknowledg'd fine, where'er beheld ; 
Yet fancied finer, when conceal'd. 
'Twas Flora's wealth, and Circe's charm ; 
Pandora's box of good and harm : 
'Twas Mars's wish, Endymion's dream ; 
Apelles' draught, and Ovid's theme. 
This guided Theseus through the maze ; 
And sent him home with life and praise. 
But this undid the Phiygian boy ; 
And blew the flames that ruin'd Troy. 
This show'd great kindness to old Greece, 
And help'd rich Jason to the fleece. 
This through the east just vengeance hurl'd. 
And lost poor Anthony the world. 

RHYME a a *

Injur'd, though Lucrece found her doom ; 
This banish'd tyranny from Rome. 
Appeas'd though Lais gain'd her hire ; 
This set Persepolis on fire. 
For this Alcides learn'd to spin : 
His club laid down, and lion's skin. 
For this Apollo deign'd to keep, 
Witli servile care, a mortal's sheep. 

RHYME a a *

For this the father of the gods, 
Content to leave his high abodes. 
In borrow'd figures loosely ran, 
Europa's bull, and Leda's swan, 
For this he'reassumes the nod, 
(While Semele commands the God) 
Launches the bolt, and shakes the poles ; 
Though Momus laughs, and Juno scolds. 

RHYME a a *

Here listening' Cloe smil'd and said ; 
Your riddle is not hard to read : 
a  guess it â€” fair one, if you do; 
Need I , alas I the theme pursue ? 
For this thou see'st, for this I leave, 
Whate'er the world thinks wise or grave, 

RHYME a a *

Ambition, business, friendship, news. 
My useful books, and serious Muse. 
For this I willingly decline 
The mirth of feasts, and joys of wine ; 
And choose to sit and talk with thee, 
(As thy groat orders may decree) 
Of cocks and bulls, and flutes and fiddles, 
Of idle tales, and foolish riddles.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e e f f 

What nymph should I admire, or trust, 
But Cloe, beauteous Cloe, just ? 
What nymph should I desire to see, 
But her who leaves the plain for me ? 
To whom should I compose the lay, 
But her who listens when I play ? 
To whom, in song^, repeat my cares, 
But her who in my sorrow shares ? 
For whom should I the garland make, 
But her who joys the gift to take, 
And boasts she wears it for my sake ? 
In love am I not fully blest ? 
Lisetta, pr'ythee tell the rest. 

RHYME a a *

Sure, Cloe just, and Cloe fair, 
Deserves to be your only care : 
But when you and she to-day 
Far into the wood did stray. 
And I happen'd to pass by. 
Which way did you cast your eye 
But when your cares to her you sing. 
Yet dare not tell her whence they spring ; 

RHYME a a b b b c c 

Does it not more afflict your heart, 
That in those cares she bears a part ? 
When you the flowers for Cloe twine, 
Why do you to her garland join 
The meanest bud that falls from mine ? 
Simplest of swains ! the world may see, 
Whom Cloe loves, and who loves me. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b 

The pride of every grove I chose, 
The violet sweet, and lily fair, 
The dappled pink, and blushing; rose, 
To deck my charming Cloe's hair. 

RHYME a b a b 

At morn the nymph vouchsaFd to place 
Upon her brow the various wreath ; 
The flowers less blooming than her face. 
The scent less fragrant than her breath. 

RHYME a b a b 

The flowers she wore along the day : 
And every nymph and shepherd said, 
That in her hair they look'd more gay 
Than glowing in their native bed. 

RHYME a b a b 

Undrest at evening when she found 
Their odours lost, their colours past ; 
She chang'd her look, and on the ground 
Her garland and her eye she cast. 

RHYME a b a b 

That eye dropt sense distinct nnd clear, 
As any Muse's tongue could speak. 
When- from its lid a pearly tear 
Ran trickling; down her beauteous cheek. 

RHYME a b a b 

Dissembling' what I knew too well, 
My love, my life, said I, explain 
This change of humour : pr'ythee, tell : 
That falling tear â€” What does it mean '. 

RHYME a b a b 

She sigh'd ; she smil'd : and to the flowers 
Pointing, the lovely moralist said : 
See, friend, in some few fleeting hours, 
See yonder, what a change is made. 

RHYME a b a b 

Ah me ! the blooming pride of May, 
And that of beauty are but one : 
At morn both flourish bright and gay, 
Both fade at evening, pale, and gone. 

RHYME a b a b 

At dawn poor Stella danc'd and sung ; 
The amorous youth around her bow'd ; 
At night her fatal knell was rung ; 
I saw, and kiss'd her in her shroud. 

RHYME a b a b 

Such as she is, who died to-day, 
Such I, alas ! may be to-morrow ; 
Go, Damon, bid thy Muse display 
The justice of thy Cloe's sorrow. 

TITLE

RHYME a a b b 

Venus, take my votive glass 
Since I am not what I was, 
What from this day I shall be. 
Venus, let me never see. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b 

Forbear to ask me, why I weep ; 
Vex'd Cloe to her shepherd said ; 
Tis for my two poor sti'ag-gling^ sheep 
Perhaps, or for my squirrel dead. 

RHYME a b a b 

For mind I what you late have writ '. 
Your subtle questions, and replies ; 
Emblems, to teach a female wit 
The ways, where changing Cupid flies. 

RHYME a b a b 

Your riddle purpos'd to rehearse 
The general power that beauty has ; 
But why did no peculiar verse 
Describe one charm of Cloe's face ? 

RHYME a b a b 

The glass, Avhich was at Venus' shrine, 
With such mysterious sorrow laid : 
The garland (and you call it mine) 
Which show'd how youth and beauty fade. 

RHYME a b a b 

Ten thousand trifles light as these 
Nor can my rage, nor anger move : 
She should be humble, who would please; 
And she must suffer, who can love. 

RHYME a b a b 

When in my glass I chanc'd to look ; 
Of Venus what did I implore ? 
That every grace which thence I took, 
Should know to charm my Damon more. 

RHYME a b a b 

Reading thy verse; Who heeds, said I, 
If here or there his glances flew ? 
O free for ever be his eye, 
Whose heart to me is always true. 

RHYME a b a b 

My bloom indeed, my little flower 
Of beauty quickly lost its pride ; 
For, sever'd from its native bower, 
It on thy glowing bosom died. 

RHYME a b a b 

Yet car'd I not what might presage. 
Or withering wreath, or fleeting youth ; 
Love I esteem'd more strong than age, 
And time less permanent than truth. 

RHYME a b a b 

Why then I weep, forbear to know : 
Fall uncontrolld my tears, and free : 
O Damon ! 'tis the only woe 
I ever yet conceal'd from thee. 

RHYME a b a b 

The secret wound with which I bleed 
Shall lie wrapt up, e'en in my hearse ; 
But on my tombstone thou shalt read 
My answer to thy dubious verse. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b 

Yes, fairest proof of Beauty's power, 
Dear idol of my panting heart, 
Nature points this my fatal hour : 
And I have liv'd ; and we must part. 

RHYME a b a b 

While now I take my last adieu. 
Heave thou no sigh, nor shed a tear ; 
Lest yet my half-clos'd eye may view- 
On earth an object worth its care. 

RHYME a b a b 

From Jealousy's tormenting strife 
For ever be thy bosom freed : 
That nothing may disturb thy life, 
Content a  hasten to the dead. 

RHYME a b a b 

Yet when some better-fated youth 
Shall with his amorous parley move thee ; 
Reflect one moment on his truth 
AVho, dying thus, persists to love thee. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b 

Dear Cloe, how blubber'd is that pretty face ; 
Thy cheek all on fire, and thy hair all uncurl'd: 
Pr'ythee quit this caprice ; and (as old Falstaff says) 
Let us e'en talk a little like folks of this world. 

RHYME a b a b 

How canst thou presume, thou hast leave to destroy 
The beauties, which Venus but lent to thy keeping ? 
Those looks were design'd to inspire love and joy : 
More ord'nary eyes may serve people for weeping-. 

RHYME a b a b 

To be vex'd at a trifle or two that I writ, 
Yourj udgment at once , and my passion you wrong : 
You take that for fact, which will scarce be found wit : 
Odds life ! must one swear to the truth of a song ? 

RHYME a b a b 

What I speak, my fair Cloe, and what I write, shows 
The difference there is betwixt nature and art : 
I court others in verse ; but I love thee in prose : 
And they have my whimsies, but thou hast my heart. 

RHYME a b a b 

The god of us' verse-men (you know child) the sun, 
How after his journeys he sets up his rest : 
If at morning o'er earth 'tis his fancy to run ; 
At night he declines on his Thetis's breast. 

RHYME a b a b 

So when I am wearied with wandering all day, 
To thee, my delight, in the evening I come : 
No matter what beauties I saw in ray way ; * 
They were but my visits, but thou art my home. 

RHYME a b a b 

Then finish, dear Cloe, this pastoral war; 
And let us, like Horace and Lydia, agree : 
For thou art a girl as much brighter than her, 
As he was a poet sublimer than me. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

The Trojan swain had judg'd the great dispute, 
And beauty's power obtain'd the golden fruit ; 
When Venus, loose in all her naked charms, 
Met Jove's great daughter clad in shining arms. 
The wanton goddess vievv'd the warlike maid 
From head to foot, and tauntingly she said : 

RHYME a a *

My heart with her but, as guest-wise, sojourn'd ; 
And now to Helen it is lionie return'd, 

RHYME a a *

Yield, sister; rival, yield : naked, you see, 
a  vanquish : guess how potent I should be, 
If to the field I came in armour drest ; 
Dreadful, like thine, my shield, and terrible my crest! 

RHYME a a *

The warrior goddess with disdain replied : 
Thy folly, child, is equal to thy pride : 
Let a brave enemy for once advise, 
And Venus (if 'tis possible) be wise. 
Thou to be strong must put off every dress ; 
Thy only armour is thy nakedness : 
And niore than once, (or thou art much belied) 
By Mars himself that armour has been tried. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

From public noise and factious strife. 
From all the busy ills of life. 
Take me, my Celia, to thy breast, 
And lull my wearied soul to rest. 
For ever, in this humble cell, 
Let thee and I, my fair one, dwell ; 

RHYME a a *

None enter else, but Love and he 
Shall bar the door, and keep the key. 
To painted roofs, and shining spires 
(Uneasy scats of high desires) 
Let the unthinking many crowd, 
That dare be covetous and proud : 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

In golden bondage let them wait, 
And barter happiness for state. 
But oh ! my Celia, when thy swain 
Desires to see a court again, 
May Heaven around this destin'd head 
The choicest of its curses shed ! 
To sum up all the rage of Fate, 
In the two things I dread and hate ; 
Mayst thou be false, and I be great ! 

RHYME a a *

Thus, on his Celia's panting breast, 
Fond Celadon his soul express'd ; 
While with delight the lovely maid 
Receiv'd the vows, she thus repaid : 
Hope of my age, joy of my youth, 
Blest miracle of love and truth ! 
All that could e'er be counted mine, 
My love and life, long since are thine : 

RHYME a a b b c c c d d 

A real joy I never knew, 
Till I believ'd thy passion true : 
A real grief I ne'er can find, 
Till thou prov'st perjur'd or unkind. 
Contempt, and poverty, and care. 
All we abhor, and all we fear. 
Blest with thy presence, I can bear. 
Through waters, and through flames I'll go. 
Sufferer and solace of thy woe : 

RHYME a a *

Trace me some yet unheard-of way, 
That I thy ardour may repay ; 
And make my constant passion known, 
By more than woman yet has done. 

RHYME a a *

Had I a wish that did not bear 
The stamp and image of my dear ; 
I'd pierce my heart through every vein, 
And die to let it out again. 
No ; Venus shall my witness be, 
(If Venus ever lov'd like me) 
That for one hour I would not quit 
My shepherd's arms, and this retreat. 

RHYME a a *

To be the Persian monarch's bride, 
Partner of all his power and pride ; 
Or rule in regal state above, 
Mother of gods, and wife of Jove. 

RHYME a a *

O happy these of human race ! 
But soon, alas ! our pleasures pass. 
He thank'd her on his bended knee ; 
Then drank a quart of milk and tea : 
And leaving her ador'd embrace, 
Hasten'd to court to beg a place. 

RHYME a a *

While she, his absence to bemoan, 
The very moment he was gone, 
Call'd Thyrsis from beneath the bed ! 
Where all tliis time he had been hid. 

RHYME a a *

While men have these ambitious fancies ; 
And wanton wenches read romances ; 
Our sex will â€” What ? out with it. Lie ; 
And theirs in equal strains reply. 

RHYME a a *

The moral of the tale I sing 
(A posy for a wedding ring) 
In tliis short verse will be confin'd 
Ix)ve is a jest, and vows are wind. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

Miss Danae, when fair and young, 
(As Horace has divinely sung) 
Could not be kept from Jove's embrace 
By doors of steel, and walls of brass. 
The reason of the thing is clear ; 
Would Jove the naked truth aver : 
Cupid was with him of the party. 
And show'd himself sincere and hearty : 

RHYME a a *

For, give that whipster but his errand, 
He takes my Lord Chief Justice' warrant; 
Dauntless as death away he walks ; 
Breaks the doors open ; snaps the locks ; 
Searches the parlour, chamber, study ; 
Nor stops till he has culprit's body. 

RHYME a a *

Since this has been authentic truth, 
By age deliver'd down to youth ; 
Tell us, mistaken husband, tell us, 
Why so mysterious, why so jealous ? 
Does the restraint, the bolt, the bar 
Make us less curious, her less fair ? 
The spy, which does this treasure keep, 
Does she ne'er say her prayers, nor sleep ? 

RHYME a a *

Does she to no excess incline ? 
Does she fly music, mirth, and wine ? 
Or have not g^old and flattery power 
To purchase one unguarded hour ? 

RHYME a a *

Your care does farther yet extend : 
That spy is guarded by your friend. â€” 
But has this friend nor eye, nor heart? 
May he not feel the cruel dart, 
Which, soon or late, all mortals feel ? 
May he not, with too tender zeal. 
Give the fair pris'ner cause to see. 
How much he wishes she Avere free ? 

RHYME a a *

May he not craftily infer 
The rules of friendship too severe, 
Which chain him to a hated trust ; 
Which make him wretched, to be just ? 

RHYME a b a b 

And may not she, this darling she, 
Youthful and healthy, flesh and blood, 
Easy with him, ill us'd by thee, 
Allow this logic to be good ? 

RHYME a a *

Sir, Avill your questions never end ? 
a  trust to neither spy nor friend. 
In short, a  keep her from the sight 
Of every human face. â€” She'll write. 
From pen and paper she's debarr'd. 
Has she a bodkin and a card ? 
She'll prick her mind. â€” She will you say : 
But how shall she that mind convey ? 
I keep her in one room ; I lock it ; 
The key (look here) is in this pocket. 
The key-hole, is that left? most certain, 
She'll thrust her letter through â€” Sir Martin. 

RHYME a a b b c c c d d 

Dear angry friend, what must be done ? 
Is there no way ? â€” There is but one. 
Send her abroad ; and let her see, 
That all this mingled mass, which she. 
Being forbidden, longs to know, 
Is a dull farce, an empty show, 
Powder, and pocket-glass, and beau ; 
A staple of romance and lies. 
False tears, and real perjuries : 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

Where sighs and looks are bought and sold ; 
And love is made but to be told ; 
Where the fat bawd, and lavish heir 
The spoils of ruin'd beauty share : 
And youth, seduc'd from friends and fame, 
Must give up age to want and shame. 
Let her behold the frantic scene. 
The women wretched, false the men : 
And when, these certain ills to shun. 
She would to thy embraces run ; 
Receive her with extended arms : 
Seem more delighted with her charms : 
Wait on her to the park and play : 
Put on good humour; make her gay : 
Be to her virtues very kind ; 
Be to her faults a little blind ; 
Let all her ways be unconfin'd ; 
And clap your padlock â€” on her mind. 

RHYME a a *

Hans Carvel, impotent and old, 
Married a lass of London mould : 
Handsome ? enough ; extremely gay 
Lov'd music, company, and play : 
High flights she had, and wit at will ; 
And so her tongue lay seldom still : 
For in all visits who but she, 
To argue, or to repartee ? 

RHYME a a *

She made it plain, that human passion 
Was order'd by predestination ; 
That if weak women went astray, 
Their stars were more in fault than they ; 
Who]e tragedies she had by heart ; 
Enter'd into Roxana's part : 

RHYME a a *

To triumph in her rival's blood, 
The action certainly was good. 
How like a vine young Ammon curl'd I 
Oh that deal' conqueror of the world ! 
She pitied Betterton in age. 
That ridicul'd the god-like rage. 

RHYME a a *

She, first of all the town, was told, 
Where ne^vcst India thing's were sold : 
So in a morning, without bodice, 
Slipt sometimes out to Mrs. Thody's; 
To cheapen tea, to buy a screen : 
What else could so much virtue mean ? 

RHYME a a *

For to prevent the least reproach, 
Betty went with her in the coach. 

RHYME a a *

But when no very great affair 
Excited her peculiar care. 
She without fail was wak'd at ten ; 
Drank chocolate, then slept again : 
At twelve she rose ; with much ado 
Her clothes were huddled on by two ; 
Then, does my lady dine at home ? 
Yes, sure ; â€” but is the Colonel come ? 
Next, how to spend the afternoon, 
And not come home again too soon ; 
The Change, the City, or the Play, 
As each was proper for the day : 
A turn in summer to Hyde Park, 
When it grew tolerably dark. 

RHYME a a *

Wife's pleasure causes husband's pain : 
Strange fancies come in Hans's brain : 
He thought of what he did not name ; 
And would reform, but durst not blame. 
At fii'st he therefore preacli'd his wife 
The comforts of a pious life : 
Told her how transient beauty was ; 
That all must die, and flesh was grass : 
He bought her sermons, psalms, and graces ; 
And doubled down the useful places. 
Pjut still the weight of worldly care 
Allow'd her little time for prayer : 
And Cleopatra* was read o'er, 
While Scot,* and Wake^f and twenty more, 

RHYME a a *

That teach one to deny oneself. 
Stood unmolested on the shelf. 

RHYME a a *

An untouch'd Bible grac'd her toilet : 
No fear that thumb of hers should spoil it. 

RHYME a a *

In short, the trade was still the same : 
The dame went out, the colonel came. 

RHYME a a *

What's to be done ? Poor Carvel cried : 
Another battery must be tried : 
What if to spells I had recourse ? 
'Tis but to hinder something worse. 
The end must justify the means : 
He only sins who ill intends : 
Since therefore 'tis to combat evil, 
'Tis lawful to employ the devil. 

RHYME a a *

Forthwith the devil did appear 
(For name him, and he's always near), 
Not in the shape in which he plies 
At miss's elbow when she lies ; 
Or stands before the nursery doors. 
To take the naughty boy that roars : 
But, without saucer-eye or claw, 
Like a grave barrister at law. 

RHYME a a *

Hans Carvel, lay aside your grief. 
The devil says ; I bring relief. 
Relief, says Hans : pray let me crave 
Your name, Sir, â€” Satan â€” Sir, your slave ; 

RHYME a a *

I did not look upon your feet : 
You'll pardon me : Ay, now I see't : 

RHYME a a *

And pray, Sir, when came you from hell ? 
Our friends there, did you leave them well ? 

RHYME a a *

All well ; but pr'ythee, honest Hans, 
(Says Satan) leave your complaisance : 

RHYME a a *

The truth is this : I cannot stay 
Flaring- in sunshine all the day : 

RHYME a a *

For, entre nous, we hellish sprites 
Love more the fresco of the nights ; 

RHYME a a *

And oftener our receipts convey 
In dreams, than any other way. 

RHYME a a *

I tell you therefore as a friend, 
Ere morning dawns, your fears shall end : 

RHYME a a *

Go then this evening', master Carvel,' 
Lay down your fowls, and broach your barrel ; 

RHYME a a *

Let friends and wine dissolve your care ; 
Whilst I the great receipt prepare : â€” 

RHYME a a *

To-night I'll bring it, by my faith; 
Believe for once what Satan saith. 

RHYME a a *

Away went Hans : glad ? not a little ; 
Obey'd the devil to a tittle ; 
Invited friends some half a dozen, 
The colonel and my lady's cousin. 
The meat was serv'd ; the bowls were crown'd ; 
Catches were sung ; and healths went round ; 
Barbadoes waters for the close ; 
Till Hans had fairly got his dose : 
The colonel toasted to the best : 
The Dame mov'd off, to be undiest : 
The chimes went twelve : the guests withdrew 
But wheji, or how, Hans hardly knew. 
Some modern anecdotes aver, 
He nodded in his elbow chair; 
F)om thence was carried off to bed : 
John held his heels, and Nan his head. 
My lady w'as disturb'd : new sorrow ! 
Which Hans must answer for to-morrow. 
In bed then view this happy pair ; 
And think how Hymen triumph'd there. 

RHYME a a *

Hans fast asleep as soon as laid, 
The duty of the night unpaid : 
The waking dame, with thoughts opprest. 
That made her hate both him and rest ; 
By such a husband, such a wife ! 
'Twas Acme's and Septimius' life : 
The lady sigh'd : the lover snor'd : 
The punctual devil kept his word : 
Appear 'd to honest Hans again ; 
But not at all by madam seen : 
And giving him a magic ring. 
Fit for the finger of a king" ; 
Dear Hans, said he, this jewel take, 
And wear it long for Satan's sake : 
'Twill do your business to a hair : 
For, long as you this ring shall wear, 
As sure as I look over Lincoln, 
That ne'er shall iiappen which you think on. 
Hans took the ring with joy extreme ; 
(All this was only in a dream) 

RHYME a a *

And, thrusting it beyond his joint, 
'Tis done, he cried : I've gain'd my point. â€” 
What point, said she, you ugly beast ? 
You neither give me joy nor rest : 
Tis done. â€” What's done, you drunken bear ? 
You've thrust your finger G-d knows where.

Fire, water, woman, are man's ruin : 
Says wise professor Vander Bruin. 
By flames a house I hir'd was lost 
Last year, and I must pay the cost. 
This spring the rains o'erflow'd my ground 
And my best Flanders mare was drown'd. 
A slave I am to Clara's eyes : 
The gipsy knows her power, and flies. 
Fire, water, woman, are my ruin : 
And great thy wisdom, Vander Bruin.

Beyond the fix'd and settled rules 
Of vice and virtue in the schools. 
Beyond the letter of the law, 
Which keeps our men and maids in awe. 
The better sort should set before 'em 
A grace, a manner, a decorum ; 
Something, that gives their acts a light ; 
Makes 'em not only just, but bright ; 
And sets them in that open fame. 
Which witty malice cannot blame. 

RHYME a a *

For 'tis in life, as 'tis in painting-: 
Much may be right, yet much be wanting ; 
From lines drawn true, our eye may trace 
A foot, a knee, a hand, a face : 
May justly own the picture wrought 
Exact to rule, exempt from fault : 
Yet, if the colouring be not there, 
The Titian stroke, the Guido air; 
To nicest judgment show the piece ; 
At best 'twill only not displease : 

RHYME a a *

It â– n'ould not gain on Jersey's eye : 
Bradford would frown, and set it by. 
Thus in the picture of our mind

Guided by law, and bound by duty ; 
Yet want this Je ne s^ay quoi of beauty : 

RHYME a b a b 

And though its error may be such, 
As *Knags and Burgess cannot hit ;

What is this talk ? replies a friend, 
And where will this dry moral end ? 
The truth of w^hat you here lay down 
By some example should be shown 
With all my heart, â€” for once ; read on. 
.\n honest, but a simple pair 
(And twenty other I forbear) 
May serve to make this thesis clear. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

A doctor of great skill and fame, 
Paulo Purganti was his name. 
Had a good, comely, virtuous wife; 
No woman led a better life : 
She to intrigues was e'en hard-hearted : 
She chuckled when a bawd was carted ; 
And thought the nation ne'er would thrive. 
Till all the Avhores were burnt alive. 

RHYME a a *

On married men, that dar'd be bad, 
She thought no mercy should be had ; 

RHYME a a *

They should be hang'd, or starv'd, or flead, 
Or serv'd Hke Romish priests in Swede. 
In short, all lewdness she defied : 
And stift' was her parochial pride. 

RHYME a a *

Yet, in an honest way, the dame 
Was a great lover of that same ; 
And could from scripture take her cue, 
That husbands should give wives their due. 

RHYME a a *

Her prudence did so justly steer 
Between the gay and the severe. 
That if in some regards she chose 
To curb poor Paulo in too close ; 
In others she relax'd again. 
And govern'd witli a looser rein. 

RHYME a a *

Thus though she strictly did confine 
The doctor from excess of wine ; 
With oysters, eggs, and vermicelli, 
She let him almost burst his belly : 
Thus drying coftee was denied ; 
But chocolate that loss supplied : 
And for tobacco (who could bear it), 
Filthy concomitant of claret ! 
(Blest revolution !) one might see 
Eringo roots, and bohea tea. 

RHYME a a *

She often set the doctor's band. 
And strok'd his beard, and squeez'd his hand 
Kindly complaiu'd, that after noon 
He went to pore on books too soon ; 
She held it wholesomer by much, 
To rest a little on the couch

RHYME a a *

About his waist in bed a-nig"hts 
She ching- so close â€” for fear of sprites. 

RHYME a a *

The Doctor undei'stood the call ; 
But had not always wherewithal. 

RHYME a a *

The lion's skin too short, you know 
(As Plutarch's Morals finely show), 
Was lengthen'd by the fox's tail ; 
And art supplies, where strength may fail. 

RHYME a a *

Unwilling- then, in arms to meet 
The enemy he could not beat ; 
He strove to lengthen the campaign, 
And save his forces by chicane. 
Fabius, the Roman chief, who thus 
By fair retreat grew Maximus, 
Shows us, that all the warrior can do 
With force inferior, is Cunctando. 

RHYME a a *

One day then, as the foe drew near, 
With love, and joy, and life, and dear ; 
Our don, who knew this tittle-tattle 
Did, sure as trumpet, call to battle : 
Thought it extremely a propos, 
To ward against the coming blow : 
To ward : but how ? Ay, there's the question ; 
Fierce the assault, unarm'd the bastion. 

RHYME a a *

The doctor feign'd a strange surprise : 
He felt her pulse ; he view'd her eyes ; 
That beat too fast, these roll'd too quick ; 
She was, he said,. or would be sick ; 
He judg'd it absolutely good, 
That she should purge and cleanse her blood. 

RHYME a a *

Spa waters for that end were got : 
If they pass'd easily or not, 
What matters it ? the lady's fever 
Continued violent as ever. 

RHYME a a *

For a distemper of this kind, 
(Blackraore* and Hanst are of my mind,) 
If once it youthful blood infects, 
And chiefly of the female sex. 
Is scarce remov'd by pill or potion ; 
Whate'er might be our doctor's notion. 

RHYME a a *

One luckless night then, as in bed 
The doctor and the dame were laid ; 
Again this cruel fever came, 
High pulse, short breath, and blood in flame. 

RHYME a b a b 

What measures shall poor Paulo keep 
With madam in this piteous taking? 
She, like Macbeth, has murder'd sleep, 
And won't allow him rest though waking. 

RHYME a a b b c c c d d 

Sad state of matters ! when we dare 
Nor ask for peace, nor ofter war ; 
Nor Livy nor Comines have shown. 
What in this juncture may be done. 
Grotius might own, that Paulo's case is 
Harder than any which he places 
Amongst his Belli and his Pacis. 
He strove, alas ! l)ut strove in vain, 
By dint of logic to maintain, 

RHYME a a *

That all the sex was born to grieve, 
Down to her ladyship from Eve. 

RHYME a a *

He rang'd his tropes, and preach'd up patience ; 
Back'd his opinion with quotations, 

RHYME a a *

Divines and moraHsts ; and run ye on 
Quite through from Seneca to Banyan.

RHYME a a *

As much in vain he bid her try 
To fold her arms, and close her eye ; 

RHYME a a *

Telling' her, rest would do her good, 
If any thing in nature could: 

RHYME a a *

So held the Greeks quite down from Galen, 
Masters and princes of their calling

RHYME a a *

So all our modern friends maintain 
(Though no great Greeks) in Warwick-lane. 

RHYME a a *

Reduce, my Muse, the wandering song: 
A tale should never be too long. 

RHYME a a *

The more he talk'd, the more she burn'd. 
And sigh'd, and toss'd, and groan'd, and turn'd : 
At last, I wish, said she, my dear 
(And whisper'd something in his ear.) 
You wish ! wish on, the doctor cries : 
Lord ! when will womankind be wise ? 
What, in youi' waters? are you mad ? 
Why poison is not half so bad. 
I'll do it but I give you warning : 
You'll die before to-morrow morning. 
'Tis kind, my dear, what you advise ; 
The lady with a sigh replies ! 
But life, you know, at best is pain ; 
And death is what we shouhl disdain. 

RHYME a a *

So do it, therefore, and adieu : 
For I will die for love of you. 
Let wanton wives by death be scar'd : 
But, to my comfort, I'm prepar'd. 

TITLE

The sceptics think, 'twas long- ag-o, 
Since gods came down incognito : 
To see who were their friends or foes, 
And how our actions fell or rose : 
That since they gave things their beginning. 
And set this whirligig a spinning ; 
Supine they in their Heaven remain. 
Exempt from passion, and from pain. 
And frankly leave us human elves. 
To cut and shuffle for ourselves : 

RHYME a a *

The poets now, and painters hold 
This thesis both absurd and bold : 
And your good-natur'd gods, they say. 
Descend some twice or thrice a-day : 
Else all these things we toil so hard in. 
Would not avail one sing-lo farthing : 
For, when the hero we rehearse. 
To grace his actions and our verse ;

Tis not by dint of human thought, 
That to his Latium he is brought ; 
Iris descends by Fate's commands, 
To guide his steps through foreign lands : 
And Amphitrite clears the way 
From rocks and quicksands in the sea. 

RHYME a a *

And if you see him in a sketch 
(Though drawn by Paulo or Carache), 
He sheu's not half his force and strength, 
Strutting in armour, and at length: 
That he may. take his proper figure, 
The piece must yet be four yards bigger : 
The nymphs conduct him to the field ; 
One holds his Â«\vord, and one his shield : 
Mars standing by asserts his quarrel ; 
And Fame flies after with a laurel. 

RHYME a a *

These points, I say, of speculation 
(As 'twere to save oi- sink the nation) 
Men idly learned will dispute, 
Assert, object, confirm, refute : 
Each mighty angiy, mighty right, 
With equal arms sustains the fight ; 
Till now no umpire can agree 'em : 
So both draw off and sing- Te Deum. 

RHYME a a *

Is it in equilibrio. 
If deities descend or no ? 
Then let the affirmative prevail. 
As requisite to form my tale ; 
For by all parties 'tis confest, 
That those opinions are the best,

Which in their nature most conduce 
To present ends, and private use. 

RHYME a a *

Two gods came therefore from above. 
One Mercury, the other Jove : 
The humour was (it seems) to know. 
If all the favours they bestow, 
Could from our own perverseness ease us ; 
And if our wish enjoy'd would please us. 

RHYME a a *

Discoursing' largely on this theme, 
O'er hills and dales their godships came ; 
Till, well nigh tir'd and almost night, 
They thought it proper to alight. 

RHYME a a *

Note here, that it as true as odd is, 
That in disguise a god or goddess 
Exerts no supernatural powers ; 
But acts on maxims much like ours. 

RHYME a a *

They spied at last a country farm, 
Where all was snug, and clean, and Avarm ; 
For woods before and hills behind 
Secur'd it both from rain and wind : 

RHYME a a *

Large oxen in the fields were lowing : 
Good grain was sow'd ; good fruit was growing ; 
Of last year's corn in barns gi'eat store ; 
Fat turkeys gobbling- at the door
And wealth (in short) with peace consented. 
That people here should live contented : 
But did they in effect do so ? 
Have patience, friend, and thou shall know. 

RHYME a a *

The honest farmer and his wife. 
To yeai'S declin'd from prime of life, 
Had struggled with the marriage noose, 
As almost every couple does : 
Sometimes, my plague ! sometimes, my darling ! 
Kissing to-day, to-morrow snarling ; 
Jointly submitting to endure 
That evil, which admits no cure. 

RHYME a a *

Our gods the outward gates unbarr'd : 
Our fanner met 'em in the yard ; 

RHYME a a *

Thought they were folks that lost their way 
And ask'd them civilly to stay : 

RHYME a a *

Told 'em, for supper, or for bed 
They might go on, and be worse sped. 

RHYME a a *

So said, so done : the gods consent : 
All three into the parlour went : 
They compliment ; they sit ; they chat ; 
Fight o'er the wars ; reform the state : 
A thousand knotty points they clear. 
Till supper and my wife appear. 

RHYME a a *

Jove made his leg, and kiss'd the dame : 
Obsequious Hermes did the same. 
Jove kiss'd the farmer's wife, you say 
He did â€” but in an honest way : 
Oh ! not with half that warmth and life. 
With which he kiss'd Amphitryon's wife. 

RHYME a a *

Well then, things handsomely were serv'd : 
My mistress for the strangers carv'd 
How strong the beer, how good the meat, 
How loud they laugh'd, how much they eat, 
In epic sumptuous would appear; 
Vet shall be pass'd in silence here : 

RHYME a a *

For I should grieve to have it said, 
That, by a fine description led, 

RHYME a a *

I made my episode too long. 
Or tir'd my friend, to grace my song. 

RHYME a a *

The grace-cup serv'd, the cloth away, 
Jove thought it time to show his play : 
Landlord and landlady, he cried, 
Folly and jesting laid aside. 
That ye thus hospitably live, 
And strangers with good clieor receive. 
Is mighty grateful to your betters, 
And makes e'en gods themselves your debtors, 

RHYME a a * 

To give this thesis plainer proof, 
You have to-night beneath your roof 
A pair of gods (nay, never wonder) : 
This youth can fly, and I can thunder. 
I'm Jupiter, and he Merciirius, 
My page, my son indeed, but spurious. 
Form then three wishes, you and madam ; 
And sure, as you already had 'oni. 
The things desir'd in half an hour 
Shall all be here, and in your power. 

RHYME a a *

Thank ye, great gods, the woman says : 
Oh ! may your altars ever blaze ! 
A ladle for our silver dish 
Is what I want, is Avhat I wish. â€” 
A ladle ! cries the man, a ladle ! 
'Odzooks, Corisca, you have pray'd ill ; 
What should be great, you turn to farce ; 
I wish the ladle in your arse

RHYME a a b b c c 

The ladle fell into the room, 
Aud stuck in old Corisca's bum. 
( )iir couple weep two wishes past, 
And kindly join to form the last ; 
To ease the woman's awkward pain, 
And a-et the ladle out as-ain. 

RHYME a a *

This commoner has worth and parts, 
is prais'd for arms, or lov'd for arts : 
His head aches for a coronet : 
And who is bless'd that is not great

RHYME a a *

Some sense, and more estate, kind Heaven 
To this well-lotted peer has given : 
What then ? he must have rule and sway ; 
And all is Avrong, 'till he's in play. 

RHYME a a *

The miser must make up his plum. 
And dares not touch the hoarded sum; 
The sickly dotard wants a wife, 
To di-a\v off his last dregs of life. 

RHYME a a *

Against our peace we arm our will : 
Amidst our plenty, something still 
For horses, houses, pictin'es, planting, 
To thee, to me, to him is wanting. 
That cruel something unpossess'd 
( 'oriodes and leavens all the rest. 

RHYME a a *

That something, if we could obtain, 
Would soon create a future pain ; 
And to the coffin, from the cradle, 
'Tis all a Wish, and all a Ladle.

When or on post-horse, or in chaise, 
With much expense, and little ease. 
My destin'd miles I shall have gone, 
By Thames or Maese, by Po or Rhone, 
And found no foot of earth my own ; 
Great Mother, let me once be able 
To have a garden, house, and stable ; 
That I may read, and ride, and plant, 
Superior to desire, or want ;

And as health fails, and years increase. 
Sit down, and think, and die in peace. 
Oblige thy favourite undertakers 
To throw me in but twenty acres :

For ])asture ten, and ten for plow : 
'Tis all that a  Avould wish, or hope, 
For me and John, and Nell, and Crop.

Around her crowd Distrust, and Doubt, and Fear, 
And thoughtful Foresight, and tormenting Care : 
Far from the throne, the trembling Pleasures stand, 
Chain'd up, or exil'd by her stern command. 
Wretched her subjects, gloomy sits the queen ; 
Till happy Chance reverts the cruel scene : 
And apish Folly with her wild resort 
Of wit and jest disturbs the solemn court. 

RHYME a a *

See the fantastic minstrelsy advance. 
To breathe the song, and animate the dance. 
Blest the usurper! happy the surprise-! 
Her mimic postures catch our eager eyes : 
Her jingling bells affect our captive ear; 
And in the sights we see, and sounds we hear. 
Against our judgment she our sense employs; 
The laws of troubled Reason she destroys : 
And in her place rejoices to indite- 
Wild schemes of mirth, and plans of loose delight.

Few virtues after these so far prevail, 
But that their vices more than turn the scale : 
Valour grown wild hy pride, and power by rage.

Rome by degrees advancing more in age, 
Shew'd sad remains of what had once been fair;

With happy laws her empire to sustain, 
And with full power assert her ambient main. 
But sometimes too industrious to be great,

And made proud conquest trample over right ; 
Disparted Britain mourn'd their doubtful sway. 
And dreaded both when neither would obey.

Undaunted minds that rul'd the rugged north ;

Till Scotland's kings ascend the English throne ; 
And the fair rivals live for ever one. 

RHYME a a b b a c c d d e e f f 

Janus, mighty deity, 
Be kind : and, as thy searching eye 
Does our modern story trace, 
Finding some of Stuart's race 
Unhappy, pass their annals by : 
No harsh reflection let remembrance raise : 
Forbear to mention what thou canst not praise : 
But as thou dwell'st upon that heavenly name,* 
To grief for ever sacred, as to fame. 
Oh ! read it to thyself; in silence weep ; 
And thy convulsive sorrows inward keep ; 
Lest Britain's grief should waken at the sound ; 
And blood gush fresh froni her eternal wound. 

RHYME a a b c b c 

Whither wouldst thou further look ? 
Read William's acts, and close the ample book : 
Peruse the wonders of his dawning life : 
How, like Alcides, he began ; 
With infant patience calm'd seditious strife, 
And quell'd the snakes which round his cradle ran. 

RHYME a a b b 

Describe his youth, attentive to alarms. 
By dangers form'd, and perfected in arms: 
When conq'ring-, mild ; when conquer'd, not disgrac'd ; 
By wrongs not lessen'd, nor by triumphs rais'd : 

RHYME a a b b b 

Superior to the blind events 
Of little human accidents ; 
And constant to his first decree. 
To curb the proud, to set the injur'd free ; 
To bow the haughty neck, and raise the suppliant knee. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f 

His opening years to riper manhood bring ; 
And see the hero perfect in the king : 
Imperious arms by manly reason sway'd. 
And power supreme by free consent obey'd ; 
With how much haste his mercy meets his foes : 
And how unbounded his forgiveness flows ; 
With what desire he makes his subjects bless'd, 
His favours granted ere his throne address'd : 
What trophies o'er our captiv'd hearts he rears, 
By arts of peace more potent, than by wars : 
How o'er himself, as o'er the world, he reigns, 
His morals strenc-thenincr what his law ordains. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

Through all his thread of life already spun, 
Becoming grace and proper action run : 
The piece by Virtue's equal hand is wrought, 
Mixt with no crime, and shaded with no fault ; 

RHYME a a *

No footsteps of the victor's rage 
Left in the camp where William did engage : 

RHYME a a a b b c b c d d 

No tincture of the monarch's pride 
Upon the royal purple spied : 
His fame, like gold, the more 'tis tried, 
The more shall its intrinsic worth proclaim ; 
Shall pass the combat of the searching flame, 
And triumph o'er the vanquish'd heat, 
For ever coming out the same. 
And losing not its lustre nor its weight. 
Janus, be to William just : 
To faithful history his actions trust : 

RHYME a a *

Command her, with peculiar care 
To trace each toil, and comment every war: 

RHYME a a *

His saving wonders bid her write 
In characters distinctly bright; 

RHYME a a *

That each revohing age may read 
The Patriot's piety, the Hero's deed ; 
And still the sire inculcate to his son 
Transmissive lessons. of the king's renown; 

RHYME a a *

That William's glory still may live ; 
When all that present art can give. 

RHYME a a *

The pillar'd marble, and the tablet brass, 
Mouldering, drop the victor's praise : 

RHYME a a *

When the great monuments of his power 
Shall now be visible no more ; 

RHYME a a *

WhenSambre shall have chang'd her winding flood ; 
And children ask, where Namur stood. 

RHYME a b a b 

Namur, proud city, how her towers were arm'd 
How she contemn'd the approaching foe : 
Till she by William's trumpets was alarm'd, 
And shook, and sunk, and fell beneath his blow. 

RHYME a a *

Jove and Pallas, mighty powers, 
Guided the hero to the hostile towers. 
Perseus seem'd less swift in war, 
When, wing'd with speed, he flew through air. 
Embattled nations strive in vain 
The hero's glory to restrain : 
Streams arm'd with rocks, and mountains red with fire 
In vain against his force conspire. 
Behold him from the dreadful height appear ! 
And lo ! Britannia's lions waving there. 

RHYME a a b c b c d d e e 

Europe freed, and France repell'd. 
The hero from the height beheld : 
He spake the word, that war and rage should cease : 
He bid the Maese and Rhine in safety flow ; 
And dictated a lasting peace 
To the rejoicing world below. 
To rescu'd states, and vindicated crowns, 
His equal hand prescrib'd their ancient bounds; 
Ordain'd, Avhom every province should obey; 
How far each monarch should extend his sway : 

RHYME a a *

Taught 'em how clemency made power rever'd ; 
And that the prince belov'd was truly fear'd. 
Firm by his side unspotted Honour stood, 
Pleas'd to confess him not so great as good ; 
His head with brighter beams fair Virtue deck'd. 
Than those wliich all his numerous crowns reflect: 
Establish'd Freedom clapp'd her joyful wings ; 
Proclaim'd the first of men, and best of kings. 

RHYME a a *

Whither would the Muse aspire 
With Pindar's rage, without his fire? 

RHYME a a *

Pardon me, Janus, 'twas a fault. 
Created by too great a thought : 

RHYME a a a 

Mindless of the god and day, 
I from thy altars, Janus, stray. 
From thee, and from myself, borne far away. 

RHYME a a b b 

The fiery Pegasus disdains 
To mind the rider's voice, or hear the reins : 
When glorious fields and opening camps he views ; 
He runs with an unbounded loose : 

RHYME a a *

Hardly the Muse can sit the headstrong horse ; 
Nor would she, if she could, check his impetuous force ; 

RHYME a a *

With the glad noise the cliffs and valleys ring ; 
While she through earth and air pursues the king. 

RHYME a a *

Slie now beholds him on the Belgic shore ; 
Whilst Britain's tears his ready help implore, 
Dissembling for her sake his rising cares, 
And with wise silence pondering vengeful wars. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

She through the raging ocean now 
Views him advancing his auspicious prow ; 
Combating adverse winds and winter seas, 
Sighing the moments that defer our ease ; 
Daring to wield the sceptre's dangerous weight, 
And taking the command, to save the state ; 
Thoug'h ere the doubtful gift can be secur'd, 
New wars must be sustain'd, new wounds endur'd. 

RHYME a a *

Through rough lerne's camps she sounds alarms, 
And kingdoms yet to be redeem'd by arms ; 
In the dank marshes finds her glorious theme ; 
And plunges after him thro' Boyne's fierce stream. 
She bids the Nereids run with trembling haste. 
To tell old Ocean how the Hero past. 
The god rebukes their fear, and owns the praise 
Worthy that arm, whose empire he obeys. 

RHYME a a *

Back to his Albion she delights to bring 
The humblest victor, and the kindest king. 
Albion with open triumph would receive 
Her hero, nor obtains his leave : 

RHYME a a *

Firm he rejects the altars she would raise ; 
And thanks the zeal, while he declines the praise. 
Again she follows him through Belgia's land. 
And countries often sav'd by William's hand ; 
Hears joyful nations bless those happy toils, 
Which freed the people, but return'd the spoils. 

RHYME a a *

In various views she tries her constant theme ; 
Finds him in councils, and in arms the same ; 

RHYME a a *

When certain to o'ercome, inclin'd to save, 
Tardy to vengeance, and with mercy brave. 

RHYME a a *

Sudden another scene employs her sig'ht ; 
She sets her hero in another light : 
Paints his great mind superior to success, 
Declining: conquest, to establish peace ; 
She brings Astrea down to earth again, 
And quiet, brooding o'er his future reign. 

RHYME a a *

Then with unweary wing the goddess soars 
East, over Danube and Propontis' shores ; 
Where jarring empires, ready to engage. 
Retard theii* armies, and suspend their rage ; 
Till William's word, like that of Fate, declares, 
If they shall study peace, or lengthen wars. 
How sacred his renown for equal laws, 
To whom the world defers its common cause ! 
How fair his friendships, and his leagues how just. 
Whom every nation courts, whom all religions trust ! 

RHYME a a *

From the Meeotis to the Northern sea, 
The goddess wings her desperate way ; 
See the young Muscovite,* the mighty head. 
Whose sovereign terror forty nations dread, 

RHYME a a *

Enamour'd with a greater monarch's praise. 
And passing half the earth to his embrace : 

RHYME a a *

But her own king she likens to his Thames, 
With gentle course devolving fruitful streams : 
Serene yet strong, majestic yet sedate, 
Swift without violence, without terror great. 
Each ardent nymph the rising current craves ; 
Each shepherd's prayer retards the parting waves ; 
The vales along the bank their sweets disclose : 
Fresh flowers for ever rise : and fruitful harvest grows. 

RHYME a a *

Yet whither would th' adventurous goddess go ? 
Sees she not clouds, and earth, and main below ? 
Minds she the dangers of the Lycian coast, 
And fields, whei'e mad Bellerophon was lost? 

RHYME a a b b b 

Or is her towering flight reclaim'd, 
By seas from Icarus's downfall nam'd ? 
Vain is the call, and useless the advice : 
To wise persuasion deaf, and human cries, 
Yet upwards she incessant flies ; 

RHYME a a *

Resolv'd to reach the high empyrean sphere, 
And tell great Jove, she sings his image here ; 
To ask for William an Olympic crown, 
To Chromius' strength and Theron's speed unknown : 
Till, lost in trackless fields of shining day. 
Unable to discern the way, 
Which Nassau's virtue only could explore, 
Untouch'd, unknown, to any Muse before ; 

RHYME a a *

She, from the noble precipices thrown, 
Comes rushing with uncommon ruin down. 

RHYME a a b c c b b 

Glorious attempt ! unhappy fate ! 
The song too daring, and the theme too great ! 
Yet rather thus she wills to die, 
Than in continued annals live, to sing 
A second hero, or a vulgar king ; 
And with ignoble safety fly 
In sight of earth, along a middle sky. 

RHYME a b b a c d c d 

To Janus' altars, and the numerous throng, 
That round his mystic temple press, 
For William's life, and Albion's peace. 
Ambitious Muse reduce the roving song. 
Janus, cast thy forward eye 
Future, into great Rhea's pregnant womb ; 
Where young ideas brooding lie, 
And tender images of things to come : 

RHYME a a b b b 

Till by thy high commands releas'd, 
Till by thy hand in proper atoms dress'd, 
In decent order they advance to light ; 
Yet then too swiftly fleet by human sight ; 
And meditate too soon their everlasting flight. 

RHYME a a *

Nor beaks of ships in naval triumph borne, 
Nor standards from the hostile ramparts torn.
Nor trophies brought from battles won. 
Nor oaken wreath, nor mural crown, 

RHYME a b b a c c 

Can any future honours give 
To the victorious monarch's name : 
The plenitude of William's fame 
Can no accumulated stores receive. 
Shut then, auspicious god, thy sacred gate. 
And make us happy, as our king- is great. 

RHYME a b b a b 

Be kind, and with a milder hand. 
Closing the volume of the finish'd age, 
(Though noble, 'twas an iron page) 
A more delightful leaf expand, 
Free from alarms, and fierce Bellona's rage : 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Bid the great months begin their joyful round, 
By Flora some, and some by Ceres crown'd ; 
Teach the glad hours to scatter as they fly, 
Soft quiet, gentle love, and endless joy : 
Lead forth the years for peace and plenty fam'd, 
From Saturn's rule, and better metal nam'd. 

RHYME a a b b b c c 

Secure by William's care let Britain stand ; 
Nor dread the bold invader's hand : 
From adverse shores in safety let her hear 
Foreign calamity, and distant war ; 
Of which let her, great Heaven, no portion bear ! 
Betwixt the nations let her hold the scale, 
And as she wills, let either part prevail : 

RHYME a a b b b 

Let her glad valleys smile with wavy corn : 
Let fleecy flocks her rising hills adorn : 
Around her coast let strong defence be spread : 
Let fair abundance on her breast be shed : 
And heavenly sweets bloom round the goddess' head. 

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

Where the white towers and ancient roofs did stand, 
Remains of *Wolsey's, or great Henry's hand, 
To age now yielding, or devour'd by flame ; 
Let a young phenix raise her towering head ; 
Her wings with lengthen'd honour let her spread; 
And by her greatness shew her builder's fame : 
August and open, as the hero's mind, 
Be her capacious courts design'd : 

RHYME a a b c b c d d e e 

Let every sacred pillar bear 
Trophies of arms, and monuments of war. 
The king shall there in Parian marble breathe, 
His shoulder bleeding fresh : and at his feet 
Disarm'd shall lie the threatening Death : 
(For so was saving Jove's decree complete.) 
Behind, that angel shall be plac'd, whose shield 
Sav'd Europe in the blow repell'd : 
On the firm basis, from his oozy bed ; 
Boyne shall raise his laurell'd head ; 

RHYME a a b b c c 

And his immortal stream be known. 
Artfully waving through the wounded stone. 
And thou, imperial Windsor, stand enlarg'd. 
With all the monarch's trophies charg'd : 
Thou, the fair Heaven, that dost the stars inclose, 
Wliich William's bosom wears, or hand bestows 

RHYME a a 

On the great champions who support his throne, 
And virtues nearest to his own. 

RHYME a a b c b c c d d e e 

Round Ormond's knee, thou tiest the mystic string', 
That makes the knight companion to the king. 
From glorious camps return'd, and foreign fields, 
Bowing before thy sainted warrior's shrine, 
Fast by his great forefather's coats, and shields 
Blazon'd from Bohun's, or from Butler's line, 
He hangs his arms; nor fears those arms should shine 
With an unequal ray ; or that his deed 
With paler g'lory should recede, 
Eclips'd by theirs, or lessen'd by the fame 
E'en of his own maternal Nassau's name. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

Thou smiling see'st great Dorset's worth confest, 
The ray distinguishing the patriot's breast : 
Born to protect and love, to help and please ; 
Sovereign of wit, and ornament of peace. 
! long as breath informs this fleeting frame, 
Ne'er let me pass in silence Dorset's name ; 
Ne'er cease to mention the continued debt. 
Which the great patron only would forget, 
And duty, long as life, must study to acquit. 

RHYME a a b b 

Renown'd in thy records shall Ca'ndish stand, 
Asserting legal power, and just command : 
To the great house thy favour shall be shown, 
The father's star transmissive to the son. 

RHYME a a *

From thee the Talbot's and the Seymour's race 
Inform'd, their sire's immortal steps shall trace : 

RHYME a a *

Happy, may their sons receive 
The bright reward, which thou alone canst give. 

RHYME a a *

And if a god these lucky numbei's guide ; 
If sure Apollo o'er the verse preside ; 

RHYME a b a b 

Jersey, belov'd by all (for all must feel 
The influence of a form and mind, 
Where comely grace and constant virtue dwell, 
Like mingled streams, more forcible when join'd)

RHYME a a *

Jersey shall at thy altars stand ; 
Shall there receive the azure band. 

RHYME a a *

That fairest mark of favour and of fame, 
Familiar to the Viliiers' name. 

RHYME a a *

Science to raise, and knowledge to enlarge. 
Be our great master's future charge; 

RHYME a a *

To wi-ite his own memoii-s, and leave his heirs 
High schemes of government, and plans of wars ; 
By fair rewards our noble youth to raise 
To emulous merit, and to thirst of praise ; 
To lead them out from ease ere opening dawn, 
Through the thick forest and the distant lawn, 
Where the fleet stag employs their ardent care. 
And chases give them images of war. 
To teach them vigilance by false alarms ; 
Inure them in feign'd camps to real arms ; 
Practise them now to curb the turning steed, 
Mocking the foe ; now to his rapid speed 
To give the rein, and in the full career, 
To draw the certain sword, or send the pointed spear. 

RHYME a a *

Let him unite his subjects' hearts, 
Planting societies for peaceful arts ; 
Some that in nature shall true knowledge found ; 
And by experiment make precept sound ; 

RHYME a a *

Some that to morals shall recall the age, 
And purge from vicious dross the sinking stage ; 
Some that with care true eloquence shall teach, 
And to just idioms fix our doubtful speech : 

RHYME a a *

That from our writers distant realms may know, 
The thanks we to our monarch owe ; 
And schools profess our tongue through eveiy land, 
That has invok'd his aid, or blest his hand. 

RHYME a a *

Let his high power the drooping Muses rear, 
The Muses only can reward his care : 
'Tis they that guard the great Atrides' spoils ; 
'Tis they that still renew Ulysses' toils : 
To them by smiling Jove 'twas given, to save 
Distinguish'd patriots from the common grave ; 
To them, great William's glory to recall, 
When statues moulder, and when arches fall. 

RHYME a a *

Nor let the Muses, with ungrateful pride. 
The sources of their treasure hide : 
The Hero's virtue does the string inspire, 
When with big joy they strike the living lyre : 

RHYME a a *

On William's fame their fate depends : 
With him the song begins : with him it ends 

RHYME a b a b 

From this bright ejc a uence of his deed 
. They borrow that reflected light, 
With which the lasting lamp they feed, 
Whose beams dispel the damps of envious night. 

RHYME a a *

Through various climes, and to each distant pole, 
In happy tides let active commerce roll : 
Let Britain's ships export an annual fleece. 
Richer than Argos brought to ancient Greece: 
Returning loaden Avith the shining stores, 
Which lie profuse on either India's shores. 
As our high vessels pass their watery way. 
Let all the naval world due homage pay ; 
With hasty reverence their top-honours lower, 
Confessing the asserted power. 

RHYME a a *

To whom by fate 'twas given, with happy sway 
To calm the earth, and vindicate the sea. 

RHYME a a *

Our prayers are heard, our masters' fleets shall go 
As far as winds can bear, or waters flow, 

RHYME a a *

New lands to make, new Indies to explore, 
In worlds unknown to plant Britannia's power ; 

RHYME a a *

Nations yet wild by precept to reclaim, 
And teach them arms, and arts, in William's name 

RHYME a a *

With humble joy, and with respectful fear 
The listening people shall his story hear, 
The wounds he bore, the dangers he sustain'd. 
How far he conquer'd, and how well he reign'd ; 

RHYME a a a 

Shall own his mercy equal to his fame. 
And form their children's accents to his name, 
Enquiring how, and when from Heaven he came. 

RHYME a a a 

Their reg-al tyrants shall with blushes hide 
Their little lusts of arbitrary pride, 
Nor bear to see their vassals tied ; 

RHYME a a b b b 

When William's virtues raise their opening* thought, 
His forty years for public freedom fought, 
Europe by his hand sustain'd, 
His conquest by his piety restrain'd, 
And o'er himself the last great triumph gain'd. 

RHYME a a a b b c c d d 

No long-er shall their wretched zeal adore 
Ideas of destructive power, 
Spirits that hurt, and godheads that devour : 
New incense they shall bring, new altars raise, 
And fill their temples with a stranger's praise ; 
When the great father's character they find 
Visibly stamp'd upon the hero's mind ; 
And own a present Deity confest, 
In valour that preserv'd, and power that blest. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

Through the large convex of the azure sky 
(For thither nature casts our common eye) 
Fierce meteors shoot their arbitrar}' light : 
And comets march with lawless horror bright : 
These hear no rule, no righteous order own ; 
Their influence dreaded as their ways unknown : 
Through threaten'd lands they wild destruction throw. 
Till ardent prayer averts the public woe : 

RHYME a a * 

But the brig-ht oi'b that blesses all above. 
The sacred fire, the real son of Jove, 
Rules not his actions by capricious will ; 
Nor by ungovern'd power declines to ill ; 
Fix'd by just laws he goes for ever right : 
Man knows his course, and thence adores his light. 
Janus ! would intreated Fate conspire 
To grant what Britain's wishes could require ; 
Above, that sun should cease his way to go, 
Ere William cease to rule, and bless below : 

RHYME a b b a c c d d 

But a relentless destiny 
Urges all that e'er was born : 
Suatch'd from her arms, Britannia once must mourn 
The demi-god : the earthly half must die. 
Yet if our incense can your wrath remove ; 
If human prayers avail on minds above ; 
Exert, great God, thy interest in the sky; 
Gain each kind Power, each guardian Deity; 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e e 

That conquer'd by the public vow. 
They bear the dismal mischief far away: 
O ! long as utmost nature may allow. 
Let them retard the threaten'd day ! 
Still be our master's life thy happy care : 
Still let his blessings with his years increase : 
To his laborious youth consum'd in war, 
Add lasting age, adorn'd and crown'd with peace : 
Let twisted olive bind those laurels fast, 
Whose verdure must for ever last ! 

RHYME a a b b b c c d d e e 

Long let this growing ei-a bless his sway : 
And let our sons his present rule obey : 
On his Sure virtue long let earth rely : 
And late let the imperial eagle fly. 
To bear the hero through his father's sky, 
To Leda's twins, or he whose glorioiis speed. 
On foot prevail'd, or he Avho tam'd the steed ; 
To Hercules, at length absolv'd by Fate 
From earthly toil, and above envy great : 
To Virgil's theme, bright Cytherea's son, 
Sire of the Latian, and the British throne : 

RHYME a a b b c b c 

To all the radiant names above, 
Rever'd by men, and dear to Jove. 
Late, Janus, let the Nassau-star, 
New-born, in rising- majesty appear, 
To triumph over vanquish'd night. 
And guide the prosperous mariner 
With everlasting beams of friendly light. 

RHYME a a *

Say, dearest Villiers, poor departed friend, 
(Since fleeting life thus suddenly must end) 
Say, what did all thy busy hopes avail, 
That anxious thou from pole to pole didst sail ; 
Ere on thy chin the springing beard began 
To spread a doubtful down, and promise man? 
What profited thy thoughts, and toils, and cares, 
In vigour more confirm'd, and riper years ? 
To wake ere morning dawn to loud alarms. 
And march till close of night in heavy arms ; 
To scorn the summer's suns and winter's snows. 
And search through ever)' clime thy country's foes ! 

RHYME a a a 

Tliat thou mig-htst Fortune to thy side engage ; 
That gentle Peace might quell Bellona's rage ; 
And Anna's bounty crown her soldier's hoaiy age? 

RHYME a a b b c c c 

In vain we think that free-will'd man has power 
To hasten or protract th' appointed hour. 
Our term of life depends not on our deed : 
Before our birth our funeral was decreed. 
Nor aw'd by foresight, nor misled by chance, 
Imperious Death directs his ebon lance ; 
Peoples great Henry's tombs, and leads up Holbein's dance. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f 

Alike must every state, and every age 
Sustain the universal tyrant's rage : 
For neither William's power, nor Marj's charms. 
Could, or repel, or pacify his arms : 
Young Churchill* fell, as life began to bloom : 
And Bradford's t trembling age expects the tomb. 
Wisdom and eloquence in vain would plead 
One moment's respite for the learned head : 
â€¢Judges of writings and of men have died ; 
Maecenas, Sackville, Socrates, and Hyde : 
And in their various turns their sons must tread 
Those gloomy journeys which their sires have led. 

RHYME a a *

The ancient sage, who did so long maintain, 
That bodies die, but souls return ag-ain, 
With all the births and deaths he had in store, 
Went out Pythagoras, and came no more. 
And modern Asgyll,* whose capricious thought 
Is yet with stores of wilder notions fraught, 
Too soon convinc'd, shall yield that fleeting-breath 
Which play'd so idly with the darts of death. 

RHYME a a *

Some from the stranded vessel force their way; 
Fearful of Fate, they meet it in the sea : 
Some who escape the fury of the wave, 
Sicken on earth, and sink into a grave : 
In journeys or at home, in war or peace. 
By hardships many, many fall by ease. 
Each changing season does its poison bring, 
Rheums chill the winter, agues blast the spring ; 

RHYME a a *

Wet, dry, cold, hot, at the appointed hour. 
All act subservient to the tyrant's power : 
And when obedient nature knows his will, 
A fly, a grapestone, or a hair can kill. 

RHYME a a b b b 

For restless Proserpine for ever treads 
In paths unseen, o'er our devoted heads ; 
And on the spacious land, and liquid main, 
Spreads slow disease, or darts afflictive pain : 
Variety of deaths confirm her endless reig'n. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

On curst Piava's banks the goddess stood, 
Shew'd her dire warrant to the rising' flood ; 
When what a  long' must love, and long must mourn, 
With fatal speed was urging his return ; 
In his dear country to disperse his care. 
And arm himself by rest for future war ; 
To chide his anxious friends' officious fears, 
And promise to their joys his elder years. 

RHYME a a b b 

Oh ! destin'd head ; and oh ! severe decree ; 
Nor native country thou, nor friend shalt see : 
Nor Avar hast thou to wage, nor year to come : 
Impending death is thine, and instant doom. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Hark ! the imperious goddess is obey'd : 
Winds murmur; snows descend; and waters spread: 
Oh ! kinsman, friend â€” Oh ! vain are all the cries 
Of human voice ; strong destiny replies : 
Weep you on earth : for he shall sleep below : 
Thence none return ; and thither all must go. 

RHYME a a *

Whoe'er thou art, whom choice or business leads 
To this sad river, or the neighbouring meads ; 
If thou mayst happen on the dreary shores 
To iind the object which this verse deplores ; 

RHYME a a b b c c c 

Cleanse the pale corpse with a relig'ious hand 
From the polluting weed and common sand ; 
Lay the dead hero graceful in a grave ; 
(The only honour he can now receive) 
And fragrant mould upon his body throw : 
And plant the warrior laurel o'er his bi'ow : 
Light lie the earth ; and flourish green the bough. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

So may just Heaven secure thy future life 
From forejg'n dang'ers, and domestic strife ! 
And when the infernal judge's dismal power 
From the dark urn shall throw thy destin'd hour ; 
When yielding to the sentence, breathless thou 
And pale shalt lie, as what thou buriest now ; 
May some kind friend the piteous object see, 
And equal rites perform to that whichonce was thee. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Shine forth, ye planets, with distinguish'd light. 
As when ye hallow'd first this happy night : 
Again transmit your friendly beams to earth : 
As when Britannia joy'd for Anna's birth : 
And thou, propitious star, whose sacred power 
Presided o'er the monarch's natal hour, 

RHYME a a *

Thy radiant voyages for ever run, 
Yielding' to none but Cynthia, and the Sun : 
With thy fair aspect still illustrate Heaven : 
Kindly preserve what thou hast greatly given : 
Thy influence for thy Anna we implore ; 
Prolong one life ; and Britain asks no more : 
For Virtue can no ampler power express, 
Than to be great in war, and good in peace : 

RHYME a a *

For thought no higher wish of bliss can frame, 
Than to enjoy that virtue still the same. 
Entire and sure the monarch's rule must prove. 
Who founds her greatness on her subjects' love ; 
Who does our homage for our good require ; 
And orders that which we should first desire : 

RHYME a a a 

Our vanquish'd wills that pleasing force obey, 
Her goodness takes our liberty away. 
And haughty Britain yields to arbitrary sway. 

RHYME a a *

Let the young Austrian then her terrors bear, 
Great as he is, her delegate in war : 
Let him in thunder speak to both his Spains, 
That in these dreadful isles a woman reigns. 
While the bright queen does on her subjects shower 
The gentle blessings of her softer power ; 

RHYME a a *

Gives sacred morals to a vicious age, 
To temples zeal, and manners to the stage ; 
Bids the chaste IMuse without a blush appear ; 
And wit be that which Heaven and she may hear. 

RHYME a a *

Minerva thus to Perseus lent her shield ; 
Secure of conquest, sent him to the field : 
The hero acted what tlie queen ordain'd : 
So was his fame complete, and Andromede unchain'd. 

RHYME a a *

Meantime amidst her native temples sate 
The goddess, studious of her Grecian's fate, 
Taught them in laws and letters to excel, 
In acting" justly, and in writing- well. 

RHYME a a a 

Thus whilst she did hei" various power dispose ; 
The world was freed from tyrants, Avars, and woes : 
Virtue was taught in verse, and Athens' glory rose. 

RHYME a a *

Since hir'd for life, thy servile Muse must sing 
Successive conquests, and a glorious king ; 
Must of a man immortal vainly boast, 
And bring him laurels, whatsoe'er they cost: 
What turn wilt thou employ, what colours lay 
On the event of that superior day, 
In which one English subject's prosperous hand 
(So Jove did will; so Anna did command) 
Broke the proud column of thy master's praise. 
Which sixty winters had conspir'd to raise ? 

RHYME a a b b b c c 

From the lost field a hundred standards brought 
Must be the work of Chance, and Fortune's fault : 
Bavaria's stars must be accus'd, which shone 
That fatal day the mighty work was done, 
With rays oblique upon the Gallic sun. 
Some demon envying France misled the fight ; 
And Mars mistook, though Louis order'd right. 

RHYME a a *

When thy* young Muse invok'd the tuneful Nine. 
To say how Louis did not pass the Rhine, 
What work had we with Wageninghen, Arnheim, 
Places that could not be reduc'd to rhyme ! 
And though the poet made his last efforts, 
Wurts â€” who could mention in heroic â€” Wurts ? 
But, tell me, hast thou reason to complain 
Of the rough triumphs of the last campaign ; 
The Danube rescued, and the empire sav'd, 
Say, is the majesty of verse retriev'd ? 
And would it prejudice thy softer vein. 
To sing the princes, Louis and Eugene ? 

RHYME a a *

Is it too hard in happy verse to place 
The Vans and Vanders of the Rhine and Maes ? 
Her warriors Anna sends from Tweed and Thames, 
That France may fall by more harmonious names, 
Canst thou not Hamilton or Lumley bear ? 
Would Ingoldsby or Palmes offend thy ear? 
And is there not a sound in Marlborough's name. 
Which thou, and all thy brethren ought to claim,
