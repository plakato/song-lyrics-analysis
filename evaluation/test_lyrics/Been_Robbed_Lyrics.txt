Cocaine flow, cocaine dough
Where that money, where that paper, where that cocaine go?  
Lay 'em down, face first, take the numbers out his cell  
Get his connect to gag him, so the faggot don't yell  
  
What happened to that street shit you rap about?  
Where that spot that you sell heron, and dope and all that crack about  
Niggas stop fronting, you don't own a Glock  
If I take it off your neck, you probably call the cop, it's like  
  
Aiyo, I had to shove the fifth in his mouth  
He tried to raise the price on me in the spring, in the midst of a drought  
Told him papi, no need, just put the slabs in the bag  
Then I told him shut the fuck up but his dog even said "arf! arf!"  
  
'88 Riker's Isle, banging for phone time  
One big nigga slid through, bulky with two shines  
Winked at my goons, they leave quick, big man ran  

We smack niggas up, shake 'em down as we see 'em  
Take his jewelry and his podium  
Sheek and Ghostface on our '88 shit, get your chest hit  
Box cutter, get your face split, they yelling like!  
  
Out of respect, I through the gun to his neck, he had singles and loose change  
And yo, four bundles of wet  
Told him, yo, kid, respect the juks, and there's one thing  
You shouldn't yell around murderous crooks and that's
