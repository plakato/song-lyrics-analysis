Spirits here are quite high.
There's a strong sense of achievement.
Some experts had warned that it might take
weeks to free the Ever Given.
But the high tide,
as well as the specialist
equipment brought in,
all helped the rescue operation.

Now the authorities will have to
address another challenge - congestion.
The head of the Suez Canal Authority said
that hundreds of stranded vessels would be allowed
through the canal on a first-come-first-served basis,
though there might be some exceptions to specific ships,
based on the types of goods on board.

The blockage put the authorities
under immense pressure,
given the major impact
it had on global trade.
For Egyptians, the canal is
not only a source of national pride,
but it also provides the economy
with much needed foreign currency.

A couple of days ago,
I asked Osama Rabies,
the head of the Suez Canal Authority,
whether he was concerned that some
shipping companies might be discouraged
from sending such giant ships
through the canal in the future.
He replied that there was
no alternative to the Suez Canal,
which he said was fast and safe.
So, it's not just about time here,
but also about security.
